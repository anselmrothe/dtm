achieve face recognition rates that are far below the ones of
a human observer.
We believe that a better understanding of the mechanisms
underlying human face recognition will be beneficial to both
the fields of medicine and machine vision. In the present
study, we applied the sophisticated method of gazecontingent windows to a psychophysical eye-movement
study of a face recognition task in order to broaden our
understanding of the underlying perceptual and attentional
processes. The gaze-contingent window technique provides
powerful experimental control and has been used
extensively in reading, scene perception, and more recently
in visual search studies (e.g. Bertera & Rayner, 2000;
McConkie & Rayner, 1975; Pomplun, Reingold & Shen,
2001; Saida & Ikeda, 1979; see Rayner, 1998, for a review).
In most of its applications, this technique obscures all
objects from view except those within a certain window that
is continually centered on the participant’s current gaze
position. The window position changes across fixations to
follow the gaze position. For example, in a study by
McConkie and Rayner (1975), participants read text that
was masked outside a visual window that included the
fixated character and a number of characters to the left and
to the right. Only the text within the window was legible.
The visual span in reading was assessed by varying the
window size across trials and determining the smallest
window size that allowed participants to read with normal
speed.
In the present study, participants were presented with
images of famous and non-famous faces and had to indicate
whether they recognized the displayed person or not. While
viewing the images, a gaze-contingent window was
administered with its size varying across trials. This allowed
us to address the following questions: First, to what extent
does face recognition rely on the simultaneous availability
of the entire face features? Second, from which positions in
the image and in what manner do participants acquire
information about a face when their peripheral vision is
restricted? It is well known that saccades during unrestricted
face viewing tend to be aimed at the region formed by the
eyes, nose, and mouth (e.g., Yarbus, 1967). However, where
and how do participants gather information if they have to
do it sequentially and be as efficient as possible? Third, how
can the moment of recognition be characterized? Is it
possible to determine this moment based on psychophysical
data?

Abstract
In eye-movement experiments using gaze-contingent
windows, the stimulus display is continuously updated in
response to the participant’s current gaze position. Usually, a
window is centered at the participant’s gaze position and
follows it wherever the participant looks. Within the window,
all stimulus information is visible, while outside of the
window at least part of the information is masked. In the
present paper, we apply this technique to a face recognition
task. By varying the size of the window, we gain insight into
face recognition processes in humans and characterize the
visual information on which face recognition relies. The
results also motivate the use of gaze-contingent windows to
study visual perception.

Introduction
Face recognition is a very important function of the human
visual system and is fundamental to our complex social
behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that face recognition
in humans has been extensively studied. Many studies
concluded that face recognition relies more strongly on
holistic information than does object recognition in general
(see Maurer, Le Grand & Mondloch, 2002, for a review). In
other words, ideally, the recognition process uses the entire
visual information available from a face.
What makes faces so special in this regard? An important
reason seems to be our everyday-life expertise in identifying
people by their faces. It was found that people can be
trained to recognize individual non-face objects, and thereby
develop analysis patterns that are similar to those used in
face recognition (e.g., Diamond & Carey, 1986; Gauthier,
Williams, Tarr & Tanaka, 1998).
Other researchers presented participants with face images
filtered by different spatial frequencies and found that only a
rather narrow band of spatial frequencies (about 6 to 12
cycles per face width) contributes significantly to the
recognition of a face (e.g., Näsänen, 1999). Again, this
finding does not apply to non-face objects, even if
individual objects of the same class are to be distinguished
(Biederman & Kolacsai, 1997).
Moreover, face recognition has received considerable
attention in machine vision research (e.g., Phillips, Moon,
Rizvi & Rauss, 2000; Senior, Hsu, Mottaleb & Jain, 2002;
Zhou., Krueger & Chellappa, 2003). Despite these immense
efforts, however, even the currently best vision algorithms

that would normally not require foveal inspection, such as
the hair or the ears, but obviously hold important
information for the face recognition process. This effect of
the gaze-contingent window on the eye-movement patterns
generally increased with decreasing window size.
The quantitative analysis of the empirical data included
the “standard” variables response time, proportion of correct
responses, fixation duration, and saccade amplitude, but also
the variables area coverage per trial and relative pupil size
(see below). Interestingly, four-way analyses of variance
(ANOVAs) for each of these variables (factors: viewing
condition, stimulus recognizability, stimulus gender, and
participant gender) revealed no significant effect by the
factors stimulus gender or participant gender or their
interaction. In other words, the gender of the participants or
the people shown in the stimuli had no significant influence
on any of the obtained variables. Therefore, in the following
analyses, data were collapsed over these factors and only
two-way ANOVAs (factors: viewing condition and stimulus
recognizability) were conducted.
Response time was found to significantly depend on the
viewing condition, F(3; 57) = 80.93, p < 0.001 as well as on
recognizability (famous faces vs. non-famous faces), F(1;
19) = 8.80, p < 0.01. The interaction between the two
factors also reached significance, F(3; 57) = 2.77, p = 0.05.
As can be seen in Figure 2a, response time increased with
smaller window size for both famous faces (no window:
1.90 s; large window: 4.57 s; medium window: 6.57 s; small
window: 9.34 s) and non-famous faces (1.82 s, 5.69 s, 7.60
s, and 11.33 s). With more severe viewing restriction,
response time became increasingly longer for non-famous
faces as compared to famous ones. The pattern of these
findings was expected, because restricting the participants’
parafoveal and peripheral vision obviously makes their task
more difficult. Detecting a familiar face should on average
be faster than deciding that a face is unfamiliar, because
before a negative decision can be made, all reasonable
possibilities for a match have to be considered. With a
smaller field of view, this effect increases, because more
information needs to be obtained for a negative decision.
The only unexpected finding is the pure magnitude of the
response time difference imposed by the window
manipulation.
The proportion of correct responses was also
significantly influenced by the viewing condition, F(3; 57) =
21.92, p < 0.001, while there was neither an effect by
recognizability, F < 1, or an interaction between the factors,
F < 1. As shown in Figure 2b, there was no tradeoff between
participants’ response time and accuracy, but actually the
opposite effect was found: The proportion of correct
responses strongly decreased with more severe viewing
restriction (91.3%, 78.0%, 67.8%, and 68.7%). Given that a
participant who just gives random responses would reach an
average of 50% correct responses, this result indicates a
dramatic decrease in performance accuracy. The fact that
there was no significant difference between famous and
non-famous faces demonstrates that participants were not
biased towards giving positive responses or towards giving
negative responses. The latter would have been found if
participants had just clicked the “non-famous” button

Method
Participants. Twenty students of the University of
Massachusetts at Boston (ten females and ten males)
participated in the present study. All of them had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision. They were naïve with respect to
the purpose of the study and were paid $10 for their
participation.
Materials. We prepared 80 face images to serve as stimuli –
20 in each of the following four categories: famous females,
famous males, non-famous females, and non-famous males.
We chose the most popular American actresses and actors
for the “famous” categories, while foreign actresses and
actors, who had never appeared in international movies,
were chosen for the “non-famous” categories. These
grayscale images subtended an area of about 18°
horizontally and 24° vertically on the screen of a 21-inch
monitor. In the gaze-contingent window trials, the display
area outside a circular, gaze-centered window was replaced
with plain gray color. Four different viewing conditions
were included in the experiment: unrestricted, large window
(diameter of 8.2°), medium window (diameter of 5.5°), and
small window (4.1°). These window sizes are illustrated in
Figure 1a.
Apparatus. Eye movements were measured with an SR
Research Ltd. EyeLink-II system. After a calibration
procedure that was typically completed in less than a
minute, gaze-position error was below or equal to 0.5
degrees of visual angle. The temporal resolution of the
system was 2 ms. The gaze-contingent window followed the
participant's gaze position with an average delay of 12 ms.
Procedure. Prior to each trial, participants were asked to
fixate a marker in the center of the display. Following a
button press, a face display was presented. As soon as
participants had decided whether the depicted person was
famous or non-famous, they terminated the trial by pressing
one out of two buttons indicating their decision. Each
participant was presented with each of the 80 stimuli exactly
once, resulting in 80 trials per participant. The trials were
administered in eight blocks of ten successive trials. Each of
the four viewing conditions was applied in two of these
blocks. The order of blocks and stimuli as well as the
combination of stimuli with viewing conditions was
systematically varied across participants.

Results and Discussion
Figures 1b to 1e show sample gaze trajectories for different
stimuli across the four viewing conditions. Notice that the
four trajectories for the same stimulus were generated by
different participants, because each participant saw each
stimulus only once. Two things can clearly be observed:
First, in the unrestricted viewing condition, only a few
central fixations were performed; the parafoveal and
peripheral information of most of the face seems to be
sufficient for successful face recognition. Second, when the
gaze-contingent window was implemented, participants
produced more fixations and directed them also at features

If it is true that the additional saccades induced by smaller
gaze-contingent windows are aimed at “foraging” for useful
information wherever in the image it is suspected, rather
than inspect focused areas more thoroughly, then this
behavior should be quantitatively reflected in the eyemovement data. In order to investigate this, we analyzed the
eye-movement variable area coverage per trial. To compute
this variable, we divided the stimulus area into 9
(horizontally) by 12 (vertically) squares. For each trial, we
calculated the area coverage as the number of different
squares that contained at least one fixation. This number
should increase with the amount of “information foraging”
(as opposed to focused examination) performed by
participants. We found the area coverage per trial to be
significantly influenced by the viewing condition, F(3; 57) =
96.42, p < 0.001, and by recognizability, F(1; 19) = 13.50,
p < 0.01. The interaction between these factors was also
significant, F(3; 57) = 5.78, p < 0.01. As shown in Figure
2e, the pattern of results for area coverage per trial is very
similar to the one for response times (Figure 2a): Area
coverage per trial increases strongly with decreasing
window size, both for famous faces (4.37, 9.49, 12.30, and
14.54 squares) and for non-famous ones (4.38, 11.73, 14.45,
and 18.77 squares). Area coverage is also smaller for
famous faces than for non-famous ones, with this difference
being more pronounced for smaller windows. This finding
supports our assumption that peripheral restriction of
information induces an exploration strategy that guides
saccades towards the most promising new locations in the
stimulus.
Finally, a variable that usually receives less attention,
although it is a “by-product” of video-based eye tracking, is
pupil size. Pupil size is known to depend on factors such as
the luminance in the visual field or the cognitive activation
of a person (e.g. Kahneman, 1973; Pomplun & Sunkara,
2003). Since we were only interested in relative changes in
pupil size, we divided all measurements by the participants’
initial pupil size after the eye tracker setup. Consequently,
values above 1 indicate a dilated pupil, while values below 1
signify a contracted pupil. We found a significant influence
of the viewing condition on pupil size, F(3; 57) = 42.58, p <
0.001, and also a significant influence by recognizability,
F(1; 19) = 8.37, p < 0.01. There was no interaction, F(3; 57)
= 1.81, p > 0.1. Figure 2f illustrates that pupil size clearly
decreases with smaller window size for both famous faces
(1.094, 1.002, 0.975, and 0.974) and non-famous faces
(1.086, 0.992, 0.952, 0.925). This could be explained by the
smaller amount of information that is available for
processing at any given time during the trial. However, why
was the pupil larger for famous than for non-famous faces?
A possible explanation is that the moment of recognizing a
famous face has an impact on the eye-movement data. In an
earlier, unpublished study on a face search experiment, we
observed that the moment of recognizing the presence of a
face tended to coincide with a prolonged fixation and
temporarily dilated pupils. If such a reaction also occurs at
the moment of recognizing a known face, then in the present
study this would not only explain the greater in pupil size,
but also the longer fixations measured for famous as
compared to non-famous faces. To test this hypothesis, we

whenever they did not recognize a face immediately, instead
of making an effort to verify their first impression.
Therefore, the analysis of the proportion of correct
responses provides evidence for the participants of the
present study to perform their task according to the
instructions.
A variable that is analyzed in almost all eye-movement
experiments is fixation duration. The duration of a fixation
indicates how long the local information in a display was
processed, which includes the duration necessary to
program the subsequent saccade. In the present experiment,
we found a significant effect by the viewing condition on
fixation duration, F(3; 57) = 23.15, p < 0.001. The factor
recognizability also exerted a significant effect, F(1; 19) =
7.84, p < 0.05, while there was no interaction between the
two factors, F(3; 57) = 1.33, p > 0.2. In Figure 2c, fixation
duration can be seen to increase with smaller windows for
both famous faces (266 ms, 315 ms, 312 ms, and 336 ms)
and non-famous faces (263 ms, 293 ms, 304 ms, 316 ms).
Since smaller gaze-contingent windows reduce the amount
of information that is available near the fixation point, there
are two likely factors that determine this pattern of results:
First, the smaller the window, the more effort is required to
merge the available visual information with the current
representation of the face in visual working memory.
Second, for efficient task performance, a smaller window
increases the necessity to aim saccades at locations where
the most useful information is assumed to be located;
consequently, the programming of these saccades requires
more time. The finding of longer fixations for famous than
for non-famous faces (see Figure 2c) is more puzzling; one
possible explanation is that the recognition process itself
causes one or more prolonged fixations – such fixations do
not occur in non-famous faces. We conducted another
analysis, reported later in this section, to test this hypothesis.
Another variable is routinely analyzed in eye-movement
studies, namely saccade amplitude, measuring the length of
saccades in degrees of visual angle. Short saccades can
indicate fine-grained processing of local information,
whereas long saccades often signify low information content
or superficial scanning of local visual input. In the present
context, we might expect saccades to become shorter with
decreasing window size in order to uncover contiguous
patches of an image. However, no influence by the viewing
condition on saccade amplitude was found, F < 1, and
recognizability showed no effect either, F(1; 19) = 2.83, p >
0.1. There was no interaction between the factors, F(3; 57) =
1.74, p > 0.1. As shown in Figure 2d, saccade amplitude
(famous faces: 6.17°, 5.87°, 6.00°, and 6.45°; non-famous
faces: 5.33°, 6.10°, 5.73°, and 6.00°) is unaffected by the
recognizability of faces or the viewing condition. This result
suggests that saccadic endpoints are not chosen to
completely inspect local areas of the image by patching
together adjacent pieces of visual information. Instead,
saccades are aimed at positions that are assumed to contain
the most significant information for the famous versus nonfamous decision. This interpretation is in line with the view
that fixations become longer with decreasing window size
because of increased effort in the programming of saccades.

separated the data for the first 75% of the duration of each
trial from the final 25%. The moment of recognition is
most likely to occur during the last 25% of a trial, so if we
found the recognizability effects on fixation duration and
pupil size to only occur during the last phase, as indicated
by an interaction of the factors recognizability and time
interval, it would support the moment of recognition
interpretation.
For each of the two variables, we therefore conducted a
two-way (recognizability and time interval) ANOVA.
While there was no significant interaction for fixation
duration (Figure 3a), F < 1, it was found for pupil size,
F(1; 19) = 6.92, p < 0.05. Figure 3b shows that the
difference in pupil size between famous and non-famous
faces clearly increases during the final 25% of the trials.
This finding suggests that the moment of recognizing a
face may be associated with pupil dilation.
All in all, the present study has shown that the
simultaneous availability of the entire face information is
crucial for efficient face recognition, which supports the
view that face recognition is a holistic process that
heavily relies on parafoveal and peripheral input.
Restricting this input has provided us with insight into
which essential information was eliminated and needed to
be foveally processed instead. Finally, we have found that
the moment of recognizing a face may be indicated by a
dilated pupil. This line of research is only at its beginning,
and we hope to inspire other researchers to consider the
technique of gaze-contingent windows for their face
recognition and other perceptual studies.
