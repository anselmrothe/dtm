Abstract
Visual illusion can be strengthened or weakened with the addition of extra visual elements. For example, in Poggendorff
illusion, with an additional bar added, the illusory skew in the
perceived angle can be enlarged or reduced. In this paper, we
show that a nontrivial interaction between lateral inhibitory
processes in the early visual system (i.e., disinhibition) can
explain such enhancement or degradation of the illusory percept. The computational model we derived successfully predicted the perceived angle in a modified Poggendorff illusion
task with an extra thick bar. The concept of disinhibition employed in the model is general enough that we expect it can
be further extended to account for other classes of geometric
illusions.

illusion is shown. The five lines below the horizontal bar are labeled

on top. In this example, line 4 is perceived to be collinear.

Introduction
Visual illusions are important phenomena because of their potential to shed light on the underlying functional organization
of the visual system. For simple illusions, a simplistic explanation can be sufficient, but when multiple effects exist in an
illusion, the final percept can be quite complex. For example, when we perceive an angle, our perception of the angle
is usually greater than the actual angle (expansion effect), but
when there are multiple lines and thus multiple angles, the
expansion effect can be either enhanced or reduced.
Such an interference effect can be demonstrated in a modified Poggendorff illusion. In the original Poggendorff illusion (see, e.g., Tolansky 1964; Morgan 1999), the top and the
bottom portions of the penetrating thin line is perceived as
misaligned (figure 1). Figure 2 shows how such a perception
of misalignment can occur. The line on top forms an angle α
with the horizontal bar, but the perceived angle α0 is greater
than α (i.e., exaggerated). As a result, the line on top is perceived to be collinear with line 4 on the bottom, instead of
line 3 which is physically collinear. However, when an additional bar is added, the perceived illusory angular expansion
effect is altered: the effect is either reduced (figure 3) or enhanced (figure 4) depending on the orientation of the newly
added bar. Understanding the functional organization and the
low-level neurophysiology underlying such a nontrivial interaction is the main aim of this paper.
Neurophysiologically speaking, in the original case where
two orientations interact, lateral inhibition between orientation cells in the visual cortex can explain the enlargement in
perceived angle. However, as we have seen in figures 3 and
4, when an additional orientation response is triggered, lateral inhibition alone cannot explain the complex effect. Our

top seemingly extends to.

observation is that this complex response is due to disinhibition, i.e., inhibition of another inhibitory factor resulting in
effective excitation (Hartline et al. 1956; Hartline and Ratliff
1957, 1958; Stevens 1964; Brodie et al. 1978). Unlike simple
lateral inhibition between two cells, we explicitly accounted
for disinhibition in our computational model to describe the
complex interactions between multiple orientation cells. The
resulting model based on the neurophysiology of the early
visual system was able to accurately predict the perceptual
performance for the modified Poggendorff illusion.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, a neurophysiological motivation for our computational model is presented, followed by a detailed mathematical description of the
model. Next, the results from the computational experiments
with the model is presented and compared to psychophysical
data, followed by discussion and conclusion.

It also comes to our attention that the cell tuned for a certain
orientation, say α, should respond to the opposite orientation,
which is α + 180◦ . However, experiments have shown that
the peak at the position α+180◦ is somewhat smaller than the
peak at α (Alonso and Martinez 1998). To accurately model
this, we need two Gaussian curves to fit the responses of a
cell to a full range of orientations from −180◦ to 180◦ .
The fitting curve can be written as follows:

slightly greater than in original Poggendorff figure.)

Computational Model of Disinhibition in the
Visual Cortex
Let us first consider how orientation columns in the visual
cortex interact in response to several intersecting lines. For
each line at the intersection, there are corresponding orientation columns that respond maximally, with a Gaussian response distribution. As multiple simple cells are activated by
the different lines at the intersection, the response levels will
interact with each other through lateral connections. Thus,
there are two issues we want to more precisely address: (1)
what exactly is the activation profile (or the response distribution) of the orientation-tuned cells, and (2) how these cells
interact with each other through the lateral connections.

The Activation Profile of Orientation Columns
Each simple cell in the primary visual cortex responds maximally to visual stimuli with a particular orientation. The response of these cells to different orientations can be modeled
as a Gaussian function:
(x − xc )2
A
y = y0 + p
),
exp(−2
σ2
σ π/2

(1)

where y0 is an offset; xc is the center (or mean); σ is the
standard deviation; and A is a scaling constant (Martinez et al.
2002).

(2)

where K is the rate of activation for the opposed direction
(K < 1). Such an asymmetric response enables the the simple cells to be sensitive to the direction (as well as orientation).
Using the equation, we can now visualize the response profile of simple cells tuned to orientations ranging from 0 to
360◦ . Figure 5 shows the responses of orientation columns
tuned to -90◦ to 270◦ (x-axis) to inputs of two different orientations, 0 and 30◦ . Figure 6 shows the responses of the
same set of orientation columns to inputs of two orientations
of 0 and 150◦ . From these two figures, we can observe that
for each specific orientation input, the excitation is tuned at
that value with a peak in the Gaussian curve, and at the same
time, the opposite orientation tuned cell shows a lower peak
response. The asymmetry in responses occur in both an acute
angle (figure 5) and an obtuse angle (figure 6). Note that even
though the difference in orientation between 0◦ vs. 30◦ and
0◦ vs. 150◦ is 30◦ in both cases, the response profile greatly
differs in the 0◦ vs. 150◦ case.
This is an improvement over conventional excitation profile models such as Gabor filters (Daugman 1980), which
make no distinction between these two angles in the two figures. Using the more accurate response profile, we will next
investigate how these response profiles can interact.

Column Level Inhibition and Disinhibition
Our observation that the angular enlargement sometimes
seems to be weakened when there are more than two bars or
lines in the Poggendorff illusion (figure 3) led us to hypothesize about the potential role of a recurrent inhibition effect,
i.e., disinhibition. Basically disinhibition is the inhibition on
other inhibitory factors, resulting in a net excitatory effect
at the target. Experiments on the Limulus (horseshoe crab)
optical cells showed that the final response of each receptor
resulting from a light stimulus can be enhanced or reduced
due to the interactions through inhibition from its neighbors.
Note that disinhibition has also been found in vertebrate retinas such as in tiger salamanders (Roska et al. 1998) and in
mice (Frech et al. 2001). In the following, the Limulus neurophysiology giving rise to disinhibition is summarized, followed by the description of our computational model based
on the Limulus model.
Hartline-Ratliff’s model of disinhibition Experiments on
Limulus optical cells have shown that lateral inhibition effect

trains of cell 1 and cell 2. The three bars below are input duration to the three cells. As demonstrated in the figure, when position 3 is lighted,
neurons at position 2 get inhibited by 3, so its ability to inhibit others get reduced. As a result, the firing rate of neuron at position 1 gets
increased during the time neuron at position 3 is excited. This effect is called disinhibition. Redrawn from (Hartline and Ratliff 1957).

is recurrent (figure 7; see Hartline and Ratliff 1957, 1958).
The final response of a specific neuron can be considered as
the overall effect of the response from itself and from all other
neurons. Conventional convolution operation using lateral inhibition alone does not account for the effect of disinhibition
which plays an important role in the final response. The final
response of each receptor resulting from a light stimulus can
be enhanced or reduced due to the interactions through inhibition from its neighbors, which may be important. (Such
disinhibition effects have been found to play an important role
in brightness-contrast illusions Yu et al. (2004).)
Hartline and his colleagues also did significant mathematical modeling of the Limulus optical cell response.

Limulus can be written as follows (Hartline and Ratliff 1957,
1958; Stevens 1964):
X
rm = m − Ks rm −
wm←n (rn − tm←n ),
(3)
where rm is the response, Ks is the self-inhibition constant,
m is the excitation of the m-th ommatidium, wm←n is the inhibitory weight from other ommatidia, and tm←n the threshold.
Brodie et al. extended this equation to derive a spatiotemporal filter, where the input was assumed to be a sinusoidal
grating (Brodie et al. 1978). This model is perfect in predicting Limulus retina experiments as only a single spatial
frequency channel filter, which means that only a fixed spatial frequency input is allowed (Brodie et al. 1978). Because

1502

of this reason, their model cannot be applied to a complex
image, as various spatial frequencies could coexist in the input. In the following section, we will build upon the HartlineRatliff equation and derive a filter that can be used in modeling orientation columns.
A simplified model of disinhibition Based on the HartlineRatliff equation above, we derived a model for twodimensional disinhibition as follows (Yu et al. 2004):
r = W −1 × x.

(4)

where r is the output vector, x is the input vector and W is
the weight matrix:

 −w(|i, j|) when i 6= j
,
(5)
Wij =

1
when i = j
where w(i, j) is the kernel function (usually a difference-ofGaussian) defining the inhibition rate from the j-th neuron to
the i-th neuron. Based on this simplified model of disinhibition, we can now more easily derive the disinhibition effect at
the orientation column level.
Applying disinhibition to orientation cells Cells occupying the same single orientation column in the cat visual cortex
are known to inhibit each other (Blakemore and Tobin 1972).
From this, we can postulate that a group of cells tuned to the
same orientation representing different lines (e.g., intersecting lines) may compete with each other through inhibition.
Now let us consider the mathematical description for the
inhibition at the column level. Suppose a group of orientation
cells tuned to orientation α receives n lines as their inputs.
The initial excitation Eαi for a cell inside this group α can be
calculated as follows:
Eαi

Rαi = (I − W )−1 × Eαi ,

(8)

where I is the identity matrix.
By applying the orientation α to all the columns, the projection of each line to the columns should shift a little bit depending on the strength of the activation of each line. Thus,
the final perceived line orientation γ can be obtained by finding the maximum response after the inhibition process:
γi = argmaxα∈C Rαi

(9)

where γi is the perceived orientation for the i-th line, R is
the responses of i-th neuron tuned to orientation α and C is
the set of all the orientation columns in layer 4 of the visual
cortex.

Experiments and Results
Prediction of Angle Expansion without Additional
Context
To test the model in the simplest stimulus configuration, we
used stimuli consisting of one thick bar and one thin line.
The thick bar was fixed at 0◦ , and the thin line was rotated
to various orientations while the perceived angle was measured in the model. The enlargement effect of the angle varied depending on the orientation of the thin line. As shown
in figure 8, we can observe that there are three major characteristics of this varying effect. First, for the acute angles,
there is an increment in the angle of the perceived compared
to actual, but for the obtuse angles, the perceived angle is less
than the actual angle. Second, the peak is around 20◦ for the
largest positive displacement, and around 160◦ for the largest
negative displacement. Third, there is an obvious asymmetry
in the displacements between the acute angles and the obtuse angles. Note that the peak at 20◦ is greater in magnitude
than the dip at 160◦ . As compared in figure 8, these results
are consistent with results obtained in psychophysical experiment by Blakemore et al. (1970).

Prediction for the Modified Poggendorff Illusion
(6)

where y0 is an offset, A is a scaling constant for the Gaussians, σ is the standard deviation, K is the rate of activation
of the opposite direction, and xc (i) is the orientation of the
i-th input line. In this way, we can calculate the excitation E
of the cell to the i-th line on a certain group of cells tuned to
α. All those parameters in this equation are fairly standard
parameters, which does not require a precise tuning.
Using the Hartline-Ratliff equation (Hartline and Ratliff
1957) for recurrent lateral inhibition and the simplified model
of disinhibition (Yu et al. 2004), the final response R of cell i
in orientation column α can be obtained as follows:
Rαi = Eαi − W × Rαi ,

0 otherwise). From this, we can finally derive the response
equation which accounts for the disinhibition effect:

(7)

where W is a constant matrix of inhibition rate (or weight,
controlled by a free parameter η: wij = η if i 6= j, and

Disinhibition effect is the key observation leading to our extension to the angular expansion model based on lateral inhibition alone. Because of disinhibition, when more than two
lines or bars intersect, the perceived angle of the thin line will
deviate from the case where only two lines or bars are present.
Figure 9 shows the prediction of our model (solid line) when
a second thick bar of varying orientations was added to the
original Poggendorff illusion (see figure 3 and 4 for an example). If disinhibition effect did not exist, the solid line would
have come out flat, however, there is an interesting peak and
a valley in the predicted response. The effect demonstrated
in figure 3 is accurately predicted by the peak near 20◦ , and
the effect in figure 4 by the valley near 50◦ . So, at least for
these two cases, we can say that our disinhibition-based explanation is accurate. However, does the explanation hold for
an arbitrary orientation? To test this, we conducted a psychophysical experiment to measure human perceptual performance and compare the results to the model prediction (the
results are shown as data points in figure 9).

secting Lines. The x-axis corresponds to the angle 6 AOB (inset),
from 0 to 180◦ . The y-axis is the difference between the perceived
angle and the actual angle. The solid line is the result predicted by
our model, and the data points * and + are data from human subjects
in Blakemore et al. (1970). The curve was generated in two iterations, with the following parameters: η = 0.009 and σ = 1.0 for
the first pass; η = 0.005 and σ = 0.5 for the second. The other
parameters remained the same for both iterations: y0 = 0.0 and
K = 0.5.

The results from the computational model (solid line) and human
experiments (data points marked * and +) on a modified Poggendorff
illusion (figure 3) are plotted. The second thick bar was rotated while
the perceived angle was measured. The x-axis indicates the angle of
the second bar. The y-axis shows the perceived angle of the thin
30◦ line. The model prediction and the human data are in close
agreement. The parameters used in this experiment were as follows:
free parameter: η = 0.02; standard parameters: y0 = 0, σ = 0.5,
and K = 0.5.

Experimental methods Two subjects with normal vision
participated in the experiment (the authors YC and YY). An
LCD panel with a 1024×768 resolution, which is supposed
to be high enough to avoid line aliasing aritfacts, was used
to display the stimuli. The computer program displayed two
thick bars and one thin line on the screen, similar to the stimulus in figure 3. The first thick bar was fixed in the center
of the screen at 0◦ , and the width was 100 pixels. The thin
line, 5 pixels in width, intersected the horizontal bar at a fixed
angle of 30◦ . The second thick bar, 100 pixels in width, intersected at the same point as the the other two, where as the
angle was varied from trial to trial. The program also displayed up to 10 thin lines (all 30◦ ) below the horizontal bar,
from which the subjects were asked to choose the one that is
the most collinear to the thin line above the bar. The subject
was allowed to click on the line of choice, and the perceived
angle was recorded for each click, and a new stimulus was
generated. A total of 101 trials were recorded for each subject.

the pairs of bars at neuronal level, and second, simply summing up the effects of two bars omits the interactions between
the lateral inhibition effects.

Results Figure 9 shows the result of the psychophysical
experiment (data points * and + for YC and YY, respectively), along with the prediction of the model (solid line).
The peak (near 20◦ ) and valley (near 50◦ ) are apparent in the
experimental data, and the overall shape of the curve closely
agrees with the model prediction. The results show that our
model of angular interaction based on disinhibition can accurately explain the modified Poggendorff illusion, and that
low-level neurophysiology can provide us with insights into
understanding the mechanisms underlying various visual illusions. Note that for this experiment, our disinhibition model
is more comprehensive than the calculation method of simply
summing up two Poggendorff effects by two separate bars.
First it is because disinhibition is the summing up between all

Discussion
We have presented a model based on angular inhibition by
considering the disinhibition effect. The soundness of the theoretical extension lies in the fact that it is grounded in physiological and psychological facts. First, at the cellular level,
lateral inhibition and disinhibition effects are found in the visual column of cat (Hubel and Wiesel 1962; Blakemore and
Tobin 1972) and it is known that the opposite directions of
the same orientation evoke an asymmetric response (Alonso
and Martinez 1998). Our prediction of the angle variations
for acute and obtuse angles shows asymmetric properties and
matches these experiments. Second, our model can correctly
predict the disinhibition caused by more than two lines intersected and the results match with our own experimental
observation using the same kind of stimuli.
Besides the Poggendorff illusion, our model has the potential for explaining other geometric illusions, such as the caféwall illusion. Fermüller and Malm (2003) showed a variation
of the café-wall illusion where adding some dots in strategic
places significantly reduced the perceived distortion. Such a
correctional effect can be explained by our model. Because
the newly introduced dots give rise to a new orientation component (as the second thick bar did in our modified Poggendorff illusion), the disinhibitory effect caused by that new orientation can reduce the distortion formed by the existing orientation components.
Even though the disinhibition model presented in this paper is largely motivated by low-level neurophysiology, disinhibition can potentially serve a more general function. For ex-

1504

ample, disinhibition can also be applied to higher brain functions such as categorization and memory (see Vogel (2001)
for a model of associative memory based on disinhibition).

Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a neurophysiologically based
model of disinhibition to account for a modified version of the
Poggendorff illusion. The model was able to accurately predict a subtle orientation interaction effect, closely matching
the psychophysical data we collected. We expect the model
to be general enough to account for other kinds of geometrical
illusions as well.
