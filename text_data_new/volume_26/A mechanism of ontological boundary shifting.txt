things with eyes are classiﬁed by multiple similarities,
things that are solid and rigid are classiﬁed by shape,
and things that are nonsolid and nonrigid are classiﬁed
by material (Jones & Smith, 2002; Yoshida & Smith,
2003). The learning hypothesis is plausible because children’s diﬀerential categorizations of animates, objects
and substances emerge only after they have learned some
number of names for these diﬀerent kinds (Samuelson &
Smith 1999), The present paper provides a simulation
model of how this might be learned.

Abstract
Past research on children’s categorizations has suggested
that children use perceptual and conceptual knowledge
to generalize object names. Especially, some researches
suggested that the relation between ontological categories and linguistic categories is a critical cue to categorize objects. However, this mechanism has not been
specified. This paper reports new insights to reveal children’s categorizations based on the survey of adults’
knowledge. We estimated the English and Japanese ontological spaces from data and used these results to simulate behavioral experiment of previous research. The
results show a possibility that linguistic cues help children to attend specific perceptual properties.

Linguistic categories and ontological categories
The fact that children distinguish animal, object, and
substance categories in noun learning is also interesting
because these ontological categories are often related to
linguistic individuation, to how diﬀerent languages quantify nouns. Most of the world’s languages treat animates
as countable discrete things. Others, like English, also
treat inanimate objects as discrete and countable. Few
(if any languages) individuate substances in these ways.
(Lucy, 1992)
Some have suggested a deep relation between ontological categories and their learning how their language
quantiﬁes entities. For example, Quine (1960) hypothesized that children learning English learn to distinguish
objects and substances by learning the count-mass distinction. In English, nouns such as “dog” and “cup” that
label individuated things are count nouns and mandatorily take the plural if there are more than one instance;
in contrast, nouns such as “sand” that label a substance
are mass nouns and are not pluralized. Thus this linguistic distinction could teach children that there are
two diﬀerent kinds of categories.
Soja, Carey and Spelke (1991) criticized this idea, because their experiments indicated that 2-year-old children who do not use count-mass syntax nonetheless classify objects by shape and substances by material. Imai
& Gentner (1997) reported supporting results in a study
comparing English and Japanese speakers. Japanese
makes no distinction comparable to the count-mass distinction in its quantiﬁcation system. Yet Imai and Gentner found that both Japanese- and English-speaking
children categorized objects by shape and substances by
material.

Introduction
Categorization is a form of information compression, one
solution to handle an almost inﬁnite number of entities
eﬃciently. Where do these categories come from and
how do children know which words to map to which categories?
Quine (1960) pointed to the diﬃculty of word learning without prior category knowledge. If we hear a novel
word in an unknown language, how do we infer its meaning ? For example, suppose we heard ‘gavagai’ while
looking at a rabbit in a ﬁeld. ‘Gavagai’ might mean rabbit, but it could also mean rabbit’s color or an inﬁnite
variety of other possibilities. By Quine’s analysis, word
learning should be highly problematic for ﬁrst language
learners.

Constraints to acquire word meanings
Markman & Hutchinson (1984) among others proposed
that children learn nouns easily because they do have
prior knowledge about kinds of categories. Research
over the past 20 years has indicated that this knowledge is considerable. Children know, for example, that
animal categories are organized by multiple similarities,
that artifact categories are organized by shape, and that
substance categories are organized by material. Given
a single thing of each of these kinds and told its name,
children systematically generalize that name to new instances in ways speciﬁc to the kind of thing it is (Landau,
Smith & Jones, 1988; Soja, Carey & Spelke, 1991, etc.)
One hypothesis is that this knowledge is learned, that
as children learn common nouns, they learn the correlations between properties speciﬁc to diﬀerent kinds and
the similarities relevant to categorizing those kinds - that

A boundary shift Imai and Genter also found differences in the range of things treated as objects versus
substances by speakers of the two languages. Speakers

of English treated complex and simple solids as objects
categorized by shape and nonsolid forms as substances
categorized by material. In contrast, Japanese speakers
treated complex solids as objects classiﬁable by shape
and treated simple solids and nonsolids as substances
classiﬁable by material. Yoshida and Smith interpreted
these results in terms a boundary shift, suggesting that
count-mass syntax shifted the object boundary in English relative to that in Japanese so that it also included
simple but solid shapes. If this interpretation is correct
then linguistic contrasts such as count-mass syntax may
play a role in the development of ontological categories.
Yoshida and Smith also predicted and found a corresponding boundary shift at the animate-inanimate
boundary. They predicted this from an analysis of
Japanese which distinguishes animates and inanimates
in ways that English does not, through its quantiﬁcation
system and also via the verbs “iru” and “aru” which
mean “exists”. In locative constructions such as “There
is,” animates require the use of iru and inmates require
the use of aru. Yoshida and Smith hypothesized that
this distinction, like the count-mass distinction in English, would perturb the boundary between animates and
objects. In support of this idea, they showed that the
range of things treated as animates (and classiﬁed by
multiple similarities) was broader for Japanese-speaking
than English-speaking children.
The purpose of the simulations reported here is to explain the mechanism underlying the boundary shift. Following Yoshida and Smith, we propose that ontological
categories are the product of learned correlations among
the properties such as shape, material and color and also
linguistic contrasts such as the count-mass distinction in
English and the iru-aru distinction in Japanese.

texture, sound, temperature, ﬂavor, movement, smell,
and function, (2) 16 adjective pairs: dynamic-static,
wet-dry, light-heavy, large-small, complex-simple, slowquick, quiet-noisy, stable-unstable, cool-warm, naturalartiﬁcial, round-square, weak-strong, rough hewn-ﬁnely
crafted, straight-curved, smooth-bumpy, hard-soft; and
(3) 48 nouns commonly known by young children 2 (see
also Table 1).
Adjective survey Participants were asked - ‘How do
you use these words (adjective pairs) to express familiar
objects’ perceptual features’. Participants made these
judgments using an electronic ﬁle of the 16 (adjectives)
by 10 (properties) cells. The ratings were on a 5 point
scale (1: very inappropriate, 2: inappropriate, 3: neither, 4: appropriate, 5 :very appropriate).
Vocabulary survey Participants were presented with
one noun at a time and asked to judge the applicability
of the 16 adjective pairs on a 5 point scale. For example,
if the adjective pair was big-small, participants would be
asked the thing labeled by the noun very small, small,
ambiguous, big and very big. Five diﬀerent orders were
used across subjects.
Analysis We used Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to analyze the vocabulary with mean linguisticscale scores of the all participants. PCA is a popular
method to compress information by the least loss of data
variance.
We used the results to estimate the English and
Japanese ontological spaces. We added 1-dimension syntactic cues which was close to ontological categories (Table 1) to raw data (16 dimensions), and analyzed the
combined data (17 dimensions). In the English condition, we added count-mass syntax which was encoded as
1-0. In the Japanese condition, we added iru-aru syntax
just as in the English condition. In the neutral condition,
we added the value 0.5 for all objects. We decided these
parameters of syntactic categories based on the dictionaries. We assumed that (1) our ontology space consists
of perceptual and linguistic properties, and that (2) the
most important factor of these space is the variance of
the object’s distribution. These assumptions are reasonable, because (1) our goal is to estimate children’s ontology space in the context of generalizing novel names
and (2) we name entities diﬀerent labels based on not
similar features but diﬀerent properties.
Our another goal is to estimate perceptual weights
in two language conditions. However, principal components consist of weights of linguistic scales, so we can
not directly know which perceptual weights the ontology
spaces have. Therefore we deﬁned perceptual weights of
principal components as the equation(1) to analyze perceptual weights in English and Japanese conditions.

Experiment 1
We measured statistical structure of common noun category via adult judgments. We studied the statistical structure of 48 nouns that name common categories
typically known by 2 year olds (Fenson, Dale, Reznick,
Bates, Thal & Pethick, 1994) 1 Ẇe did this in two steps.
First, we asked adults to judge how a list of 16 adjectives
taken from some studies using the Semantic Diﬀerential (the SD; Osgood, 1957) described category relevant
properties such as shape, material, movement. Second,
in vocabulary survey, we asked adults to rate how the 16
adjectives described the 48 noun categories.

Method
Participants In the adjective survey, we recruited 12
volunteers (from 23 to 25 years old) from Kyoto university. In the vocabulary survey, we recruited 104 students
(from 18 to 22 years old) from Kyoto Koka women’s university who received a class credit for participation.

clusters like MCDI classes, but did not show any global
boundaries. On the other hand, the analyses of the English and Japanese conditions showed the global boundary (Figures 2 and 3). There were two global clusters
categorized near by the root of the tree. One cluster
mainly consisted of ‘objects’ category members, and another cluster mainly consisted of ‘substance’ category
members. The second branch occurred in the object
cluster. There was the ‘animates’ cluster near substance
cluster in the part of objects cluster. That is why, English ontology space seemed deﬁned by ‘individuation’
or ‘solidity’.
In the Japanese condition, there were two global clusters that mainly consisted of ‘animates’ members and
‘inanimates’ members. Despite being inanimates, vehicles(e.g. ‘airplane’, ‘car’) and body parts(e.g. ‘eye’,
‘hand’) were near the animates members. There seemed
an ‘animacy’ boundary in the Japanese ontological space
because animates and dynamic objects make cluster and
inanimates make another cluster.
Perceptual weights of the English and Japanese
spaces We estimated perceptual weight in the English
and Japanese ontological spaces. Tables 2 shows the
results of the estimation.
Compared with the Japanese condition, the English
condition showed higher weight on shape. Contrary to
the English condition, the Japanese condition showed
higher weights on color and texture.
Estimating ontological category One potential
problem with the present experiment is that the perceptual ontological space was derived from only Japanese
speaker’s data.
We are currently collecting the English data. Preliminary results indicate that they are extremely similar to
those of Japanese speakers. The Pearson’s correlation
of mean across participants are .79 in vocabulary survey and .80 in adjective survey. In this work, we have
assumed that the adjective - noun ratings and the adjectives - properties ratings reﬂect the perceptual structure
of the categories. It could be argued that these rating
reﬂect instead how predicates and nouns co-occur in a
language.
Sommers (1963) claimed that knowledge of ontological
categories is intimately related to predicability, that is,
to the knowledge of which predicates in a language can
be combined with which nouns. For example, the predicate ‘is asleep’ distinguishes animals and non-animals.
Furthermore, Keil (1979, 1981) showed that children’s
judgments of predicability, like those of adults, yield an

d is a dimension of principal components. l is a index of
16 linguistic scales of the SD (see also Method). p is the
index of the 10 perceptual properties (see also Method).
Wdp is the pth perceptual weight of dth principal component. Cdl is the loading of lth linguistic scales of dth
principal component. Mlp is the estimated expressiveness of the pth perception of the lth linguistic scales.
Cd∗ is a unit row vector and M∗p is a unit column vector, so Wdp is the absolute inner product of two vectors,
or | cosθ | (θ is the angle of two vectors).

Results and Discussion
First three and six principal components respectively accounted for more than 70% and 90 % of the variability
in the data.
Estimated ontological spaces The ﬁrst two principal components of the vocabulary survey data were displayed as a 2-dimensional plot (Figure 1 is the result of
neutral condition). In the neutral condition, we found
animates and body parts in upper-right area, vehicles in
upper-left area, furniture in lower-left area and substance
in lower-right area. This distribution of entities leads us
the following interpretation of the ﬁrst two components.
The ﬁrst principal component axis can be interpreted as
‘solidity’, because solid and non-solid entities are located
in the left and right sides, respectively. The second principal component axis can be interpreted as ‘animacy’,
because dynamic and static entities are located in the
upper and lower sides, respectively.
There were no clear boundaries in neutral 2dimensional space, but we found global boundaries in
the English and Japanese space. Furthermore, the English and Japanese spaces had a great diﬀerence. The
English space also had ‘solidity’ axis as the ﬁrst principal component, but the Japanese space had ‘animacy’
axis as the ﬁrst principal component. Therefore, we analyzed these distributions of entities by clustering.
First three principal components (total 70% over) were
enough to analyze global structure of results, so we analyzed this 3-dimensional data by hierarchical clustering(Figures 2 and 3).
The clustering of the neutral condition showed the

ontological tree, though a less elaborate one than adults.
The question of whether our judgments reﬂect the structure of categories in the world or relations among words
is a diﬃcult one. Given our preliminary results from English, if they do reﬂect relations among words-predicates
and nouns,those relations are nearly identical in the two
language, a fact one might want to explain by the regularities in the world.

Experiment to be simulated The speciﬁc goal is to
simulate Yoshida and Smith’s second experiment which
showed a boundary shift in the animate - inanimate
boundary Japanese speakers relative to English speakers. The participants in Yoshida and Smith’s experiment
were 3-year-old English and Japanese monolingual children. The experimenters presented children with an ambiguous entity that could be seen as depictions of ether
animates or inanimates and named it with a novel label
(e.g. in Japanese ‘Kore-wa teema dayo’, in English ‘This
is a teema.’). Experimenters did not provide any cue
such as “iru” or “aru” which might cue these as depictions of animates or inanimates Experimenters then presented children with test objects and asked them whether
the test object had the same name Exemplars and test
objects matched or did not match in three perceptual
features (Table 3).
The results suggested that Japanese speakers treated
these ambiguous forms as depictions of animates, extending the name to new instances by multiple similarities. In contrast, English speakers treated them as
inanimates objects, extending the name to new instances
by shape. Thus, Yoshida and Smith proposed that the
Japanese speaking children included a wider range of
kinds in the animate category relative to English speakers just as English speakers include a wider range of instances in the objects category than do Japanese speakers. The question for Experiment 2 is whether we can
use the adult judgments in Experiment 1 to simulate
these results.

Following Yoshida and Smith’s method, we assumed that
objects categories are deﬁned in terms of shape, color
and texture, and that other nonstudied features will have
no eﬀect on the similarity of a test object to the exemplar.
We also assume that children’s name extensions are
based on the psychological distance between a test object
and the exemplar. We deﬁned the psychological distance
between stimuli by the equation (3). Probability of ‘yes’
response which means two objects belong to the same
category is deﬁned by the equation (2).

Results and Discussion
We simulated the second experiment of Yoshida and
Smith (Figure 4) by the computational model (Figure 5).
We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate optimal parameters. In the result, we estimated b = 12, m = 0.8、
(Dshape , Dtexture , Dcolor ) = (7, 1, 0.6) (Dtexture = 1 is
constant) and R2 = 0.916 between the response patterns
(12=2 (language of participants)×6 (feature controlled
condition)) of simulation and those of behavior. When
we did not add two parameters Di s, the ﬁtness of the
model was R2 = 0.683. This suggested the methodological problem of estimation by the equation (2).
In the behavioral experiment, the English speakers
categorized the stimuli based on their shape and the
Japanese speakers categorized them based on their multiple features. These results suggested that the English
speakers categorized ambiguous objects as inanimates
whereas Japanese speakers categorize them as animates.
Thus our model ﬁtted the behavioral results well, and
provides a simple account of the crosslinguistic diﬀerence.

General Discussion
Recent studies on early word acquisition have shown that
some biases, such as shape bias, are not so universal,
but dependent on context and language. For example,
Children speaking English show stronger shape bias for

569

inanimate objects than those speaking Japanese. These
ﬁndings are explained by postulating children’s linguistic, cultural and category knowledge inﬂuences boundaries between ontological categories.
The present simulation oﬀers a mechanism. The results of the simulation suggest that (1) ontological categories may not be a special nor given but an emergent property derived from multidimensional perceptual
and linguistic features, and (2) crosslinguistic diﬀerences
along this ontological continuum can be explained by a
diﬀerence in the emergent variable due to diﬀerent statistical structure of linguistic features. Speciﬁcally, we
assumed that the emergent property can be extracted by
information compression of the multidimensional feature
space, such as PCA. To evaluate whether we can account
for the behavioral ﬁndings, we conducted a survey to obtain the multidimensional feature space of objects, and
a series of quantitative analyses to obtain the language
speciﬁc ontological spaces. Without linguistic features,
the compressed perceptual space spanned by two principal components was organized by objects’ solidity or size.
Thus, a solidity-dominant space can be derived from
the perceptual feature space, but there was no principal
component representing an “individuation continuum”
from animates to objects to substances. More interestingly, addition of linguistic features made the ontological space more well-deﬁned, and the estimated languagespeciﬁc ontological spaces are quite consistent with previous ﬁndings. The estimated English ontological space
was solidity-dominant and shape-weighted. This is consistent with Colunga & Smith (2000) and Samuelson
(2002) showing that American children attended solidity
of objects in object categorization. On the other hand,
the estimated Japanese ontological space is animacydominant and color-and-texture-weighted, which is consistent with Yoshida & Smith (2001, 2003) showing that

Japanese children attended multiple features of objects.
Furthermore, objects/substance boundary was clearer
in the English space than the Japanese space. This results is consistent with Imai & Gentner (1997). In addition to qualitative matches with previous data, our
theory make a good quantitative ﬁt to the behavioral
data of Yoshida & Smith (2003). With a simple computational model that categorization response is based
on similarity derived from a distance on the ontological
space, the behavioral data showing diﬀerence in shape
bias for objects between English and Japanese speaking
children with various diﬀerent stimulus conditions could
be simulated quite well.

Beyond the “boundary shift” Our account expands the boundary shift hypothesis in the following
senses. First, our theory proposes an underlying mechanism of boundary shift in a quantitative fashion. Second,
the individuation continuum is not a separate dimension,
but a statistical property embedded in the multidimensional feature space. Ontological features such as animacy and solidity may be extracted from perceptual and
linguistic features through statistical learning. This suggests a possibility that more abstract conceptual features
are also formed by statistical learning of basic perceptual
and linguistic features.
