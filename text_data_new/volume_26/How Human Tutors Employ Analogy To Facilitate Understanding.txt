Abstract
A corpus consisting of eighty-one one-on-one tutoring
sessions with first-year medical students carried on by two
professors of physiology at Rush Medical College was
analyzed for the use of analogies to facilitate understanding of
the topics covered. Analogies were infrequently used, but had
a positive effect on improving student comprehension of the
topics tutored. The human tutor’s goals, topics, discourse
strategies, follow-up, and clarification in the presence of
misunderstanding were analyzed with the long term goal of
implementing analogies in an intelligent tutoring system.

Introduction
Analogies play a major role in learning. Eighty-one oneon-one tutoring sessions carried out by two professors of
physiology at Rush Medical College were extensively
marked for analogies using SGML. Instances of analogies
were then classified in terms of the goals, targets, bases, and
whether they were proposed by the student or the tutor.
Current advances in education, cognitive science,
linguistics, and expert systems make it feasible to generate
analogies in an intelligent tutoring system using a
computational model. To date, as far as we know, no one
has used full-scale natural language generation to implement
analogies in an electronic tutoring system. The goal is to use
computational models of memory retrieval and analog
mapping to simulate the human tutor’s behavior in our
intelligent tutoring system, CIRCSIM-Tutor.

analyze the way humans store and retrieve
analogues from memory (Forbus, Gentner, & Law,
1995; Hofstadter, 2001; Holyoak, Gentner, &
Kokinov, 2001; Holyoak & Thagard, 1995;
Kokinov & Petrov, 2001; Kolodner, 1993)
use computational models to simulate the results of
human studies (Forbus, 2001; Forbus, Gentner, &
Law, 1995; Holyoak, & Thagard, 1995)
analyze the use of analogy in problem
solving/reasoning (Holyoak & Thagard, 1985;
Holyoak, Gentner, & Kokinov 2001; Kolodner,
1993; Thagard, 1997)
analyze the use of analogies in education,
medicine, and scientific inquiry (Dunbar, 1993,
1995; Goldblum, 2001; Thagard, 1997)

Gentner’s (1983, 1998) structure mapping theory (Gentner
& Markman, 1997; Holyoak, Gentner, & Kokinov, 2001;
Holyoak & Thagard, 1995; Kurtz, Miao, & Gentner, 2001)
seems to closely match the way our expert tutors work. New
knowledge (the target) is learned by mapping its structure to
existing knowledge (the base). Inferences are made from
these mappings. The representation of mappings is
discussed in length in Yan, Forbus, & Gentner (2003).
When retrieving possible analogs from memory, the goal is
to find mappings that have predictive value (Gentner, 1983).
Further studies have demonstrated that analogical
encoding—the “process of comparing two examples and
deriving an abstraction on the basis of their commonalities”
(Loewenstein, Thompson, & Gentner, 1999, p. 586)—can
be effective in facilitating the learning of similar problems.
Abstractions of schemas gained through the intensive
comparisons of two analogous concepts that are not fully

Analogies in Cognitive Science
Gentner defines analogies as:
partial similarities between different situations
that support further inferences. Specifically,
analogy is a kind of similarity in which the same
system of relations holds across different objects.
Analogies thus capture parallels across different
situations (Gentner, 1998, p.107).

discussed in Li, Seu, Evens, Michael, & Rovick (1992).
CDS forces each person to take turns typing. An annotation
language based on SGML (Kim, Freedman, Glass, & Evens,
2002) was used to mark up the human sessions by hand. The
following examples (discussed in Lulis & Evens, 2003;
Lulis, Evens & Michael, 2003) were selected from the
analogies found in these expert human tutoring sessions.
They are representative of sessions where the tutor uses
analogies: new material is explained, misconceptions are
corrected, and prompts—successful and unsuccessful—are
made to the student to make analogies and inferences. In
each of the examples listed, the tutors used analogies after
the student made an incorrect inference. The identifiers at
the beginning of each sentence make it possible to find the
original context at any time: initial F or K indicates whether
the session was face-to-face or keyboard-to-keyboard; the
session number comes next; st (student) or tu (tutor)
indicates who is speaking/typing; this is followed by the
turn number and the number of the sentence within the turn.

understood not only facilitate the understanding of the new
pieces of information, but the general schemas derived can
be applied to similar problems encountered later (Gentner,
Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003; Kurtz, Miao, & Gentner,
2001; Loewenstein, Thompson, & Gentner, 1999). Studies
involving the learning of negotiation skills in
undergraduates and graduate management students
(Loewenstein, Thompson, & Gentner, 1999) and
presentation of heat flow scenarios to teach the concept of
heat flow (Kurtz, Miao, & Gentner, 2001) demonstrated that
the intentional and intensive comparisons of two concepts
that are not fully understood are as effective in knowledge
transfer as structural alignment. Gentner (1983)
demonstrated that this approach to teaching by analogy
bypasses the common problem that humans have when
trying to retrieve relevant information from memory to
connect to new knowledge that one is attempting to learn.
Mutual alignment is especially relevant to electronic
tutoring systems that cannot always rely on the presence of
existing knowledge when presenting new concepts.
Possible problems resulting from misunderstandings when
reasoning analogically in a scientific domain are wellrecognized (Feltovich, Spiro, & Coulson, 1989). Holyoak
and Thagard (1995) have studied misconceptions and
devised the multiconstraint theory that addresses the
problems resulting from the use of inappropriate analogies.
They recommend placing certain restrictions—of similarity,
structure, and purpose—on the analogy. If all three
constraints are met, only one interpretation of the analogy
can be gleaned from the mapping. In cases where the three
constraints are not met, misunderstandings can be identified
and corrected. We have observed this behavior in our expert
tutors’ human sessions, as discussed below.

Example 1. Face-to-face session number one (F1) contains
examples of the use of analogy to explain domain material
and a correction by the tutor. The analogy of comparing the
heart to a sink is proposed by the student (st). However, the
sink is not a compliant object and the heart is. As a result,
the tutor (tu) offers a better analogy—the heart is like a
balloon.
F1-st-62-1: If I make an analogy of you try to fill a sink
with water and you...
F1-tu-63-1: Try to fill a balloon with water, since that's what
we're dealing with, a distensible object.
F1-st-64-1: OK.

Analysis of Analogies Found in the Corpus
In order to understand our human tutoring session, one must
first have background information on what is being tutored.
The human body requires a blood pressure within a certain
range to sustain life. The baroreceptor reflex is a negative
feedback system that controls blood pressure in the
cardiovascular system to ensure that the pressure remains
within this range. When a perturbation in the system occurs,
the response has three phases: direct response (DR) of the
system to the perturbation, the reflex response (RR) to the
new values of affected variables, and the steady state (SS),
or state of the system after it has re-stabilized. CIRCSIMTutor asks the student to predict the qualitative changes in
several important variables at all three stages. The variables
are: Heart rate (HR), Cardiac Contractility (CC), Stroke
volume (SV), Cardiac output (CO), Mean arterial pressure
(MAP), Total peripheral resistance (TPR), Central venous
pressure (CVP). Eighty-one hour-long tutoring sessions
with first year medical students solving problems about the
baroreceptor reflex were conducted by our experts, two
professors of physiology at Rush Medical College, Joel
Michael and Allen Rovick. Face-to-face sessions were
recorded and transcribed. Keyboard-to-keyboard sessions

After making a one-to-one mapping of the base (balloon) to
the target (heart), a correct inference is made. In accordance
with Holyoak and Thagard (1995) and Gentner’s (1983)
theory of structure mapping, the following structures
underlie what the tutor does (as discussed in Lulis & Evens,
2003; Lulis, Evens, & Michael, 2003):
Structure for the balloon
• fill a balloon with water
• it will distend
• the pressure in the balloon increases as it distends
Structure for the heart
• fill the right atrium
• the right atrium will distend
• the pressure will increase as it distends
The above example demonstrated the effectiveness of the
accepted structure mapping approach of connecting new
knowledge to knowledge already understood by the student.

Example 3. In keyboard-to-keyboard session number one
(K1), the tutor prompts the student to make an analogy
between neurally controlled variables in the DR (direct
response) period. The behavior of the variable TPR during
the DR period has already been tutored. The inference is
that all neurally controlled variables will behave similarly
during this period. The student makes the connection
between the analogs resulting in a correct inference.

As a result, the student develops a better understanding of
the new concept (Gentner, 1983, 1998; Goldblum, 2001;
Holyoak & Thagard, 1995).
Example 2. We see the tutor correcting a misconception in
face-to-face session #7.
F7-tu-267-1: Well, let's give it another thought, OK?
F7-tu-267-2: We can look at that central blood chamber that
means the big veins and the atria together as
though they were an elastic chamber.
F7-tu-267-3: Is that not correct?
F7-st-268-1: Yeah, and the heart is the pump.
F7-tu-269-1: Well, let's stick to this elastic chamber and
look at it first more or less in isolation.
F7-tu-269-2: If you have an elastic chamber what are the
things that determine the pressure inside that
chamber.
F7-st-270-1: Size.
F7-st-270-2: No.
F7-st-270-3: I mean if you..
F7-st-270-4: I mean...
F7-st-270-5: Area is one but I gather for the heart..
F7-tu-271-1: Area of what?
F7-st-272-1: Area that..
F7-st-272-2: I mean if you want to know what the pressure
is of a gas or well liquids aren't that...
F7-st-272-3: We're not talking about gas, we're talking
about liquids.
F7-st-272-4: And liquids are not affected by size because
you can't compress the molecules that much.
F7-tu-273-1: Oh, you mean the volume occupied by the
liquid, expansion and condensation of the
liquid.
F7-tu-273-2: No.
F7-tu-273-3: That's not an issue.
F7-st-274-1: No, because we're talking about liquids and
liquids aren't affected.
F7-st-274-2: Like with gas, besides the container matters a
lot....
F7-tu-275-1: Let's throw away this atria central venous
system and take instead something inanimate
elastic stretcher, say like a balloon.
F7-tu-275-2: Right?
F7-tu-275-3: What determines what the pressure is inside
the balloon?

K1-st-29-1:During the DR period it would remain
unchanged.
K1-tu-30-1: Correct.
K1-tu-30-2: What other variables are neurally controlled?
K1-st-31-1: CC, HR
K1-tu-32-1: Again correct.
Example 4. An example of the student not getting the point
of the analogy is seen in keyboard-to-keyboard session #5
(K5). After tutoring the neurally controlled variable CC, the
tutor attempts to get the student to make an analogy between
it and other neurally controlled variables. The student fails
to make the analogy and the tutor finally tells the student the
analogy that he is seeking.
K5-tu-31-1: No, it is under neural (sympathetic) control,rily.
K5-tu-31-2: We are now discussing what happens in the DR
period, before any neural (reflex ) effects.
K5-tu-31-3: Sowhat will happ en to CC in this pe;riod?
K5-st-32-1: Cc 0.
K5-tu-33-1: Correct.
K5-tu-33-2: While we're on the subject, what other variable
is underneural contro l and how will it be
affected in the DR?
K5-st-34-1: SV 0.
K5-st-34-2: It will not be affected in the DR.
K5-tu-35-1: Not true.
K5-tu-35-2: SV is only partially under neural control via
CC, one of its importan t determinants.
K5-tu-35-3: We'll come back to this in a moment.
K5-tu-35-4: What othervariable is un der neural control?
K5-tu-39-3: LIKE CC!.
K5-st-40-1: TPR 0.
Example 5. More interesting analogies can be found in
several sessions. Keyboard-to-keyboard session number
sixty-four (K64) contains an analogy proposed by the
student (st) between the heart and a traffic cop. The
mapping between these analogs is not correct; the tutor (tu)
proposes a more suitable analogy between the heart and a
traffic jam. The structure mapping theory discussed in
Gentner (1983, 1998), Goldblum (2001), Holyoak and
Thagard (1995), and formalizes what the tutor is doing.

In the above example, an analogy of the atria as an elastic
chamber is proposed by the tutor, but the structure of the
intended base analog—the atria or central venous system as
a reservoir—is not understood by the student resulting in a
failure to make the connection between existing knowledge
and the new knowledge. The tutor suggests a base that the
student is familiar with—a balloon to compare the atria to.
A correct structure mapping is made allowing the student to
understand the new concept.

K64-st-54-1: Would it be a reasonable analogy to look at the
heart like a traffic cop?
K64-st-54-2: If it slows down the rate of blood flow (lets
fewer cars through) then there will be a
863

did not request inferences from the students. However,
students did make correct inferences four out of the five
times without prompting. In the remaining thirty-seven
cases, an inference was requested after the analogy was
proposed resulting in correct inferences being made by
students fifteen times without repair to the analogy (to
correct misunderstandings) and fifteen times with repair—
81% success rate. In only seven of the thirty-seven cases—
19% of the time—did the tutor abandon the use of analogy
and opt for a different teaching strategy. In total, the use of
analogy after an incorrect prediction was followed by a
correct prediction in 34 out of the 42 times—81% success
rate. The empirical evidence suggests that the use of
analogy had positive affects on the students’ ability to
understand the material.
If we examine the different bases employed while tutoring
using analogies—proposed by students and tutors—we find
a wide range, as shown in Table 2. The analogy that was
most often proposed by the tutors was another neural
variable—twenty-nine times. In five of these cases, the
tutors eventually gave up on the analogy and utilized a
different approach to the material, but the other twenty-four
were ultimately successful. There was one successful
mapping without an attempt at an inference, twelve
successful mappings with correct inferences, and four
successful mappings with correct inferences after repairs.
Other successful mappings occurred using in a wide variety
of bases such as the heart as a balloon or pump, Ohm’s law,
airplane wings, bootstraps, a dimmer switch, traffic jams,
and a black box. These bases were not observed as often,

backup behind it (a backflow of blood
prior to the heart, and therefore an increase in
CVP) and fewer cars coming through (less
blood coming out of the heart and therefore a
decrease in MAP)
K64-tu-55-1: The analogy is OK.
K64-tu-55-2: But just as traffic jam does not occur
because cars back up, the increase in CVP
caused by a fall in CO is not the result of
blood BACKING UP.
K64-tu-55-3: Everything soes in one direction.
K64-st-56-1: well, slowing down would be a better way to
put it then
K64-tu-57-1: Yes.
K64-tu-57-2: A traffic jam caused by everybody piling into
the same area at once.

Analogies in Human Tutoring Sessions
In the tutoring sessions that we have studied, we observe
expert tutors taking steps to avoid misconceptions. They
(Holyoak & Thagard, 1995):
•
•
•

•

Make certain that students understand the system
mapping.
Use a variety of analogies.
Inform students when an analogy is relevant and
when it is not—point out the differences, as well as
the similarities, between the known knowledge and
the target.
Correct misconceptions when they occur.

The outcomes of the analogies proposed by the tutor are
shown in Table 1 (as discussed in Lulis & Evens, 2003;
Lulis, Evens, & Michael, 2003). We summarize the

the human propensity to favor relationships between bases
and targets when comparisons are made and to favor
superficial similarities and not retrieve the more profound
analogical similarities while still, on occasion, retrieving
relevant structural comparisons (Forbus, Gentner, & Law,
1995). Working memory consists of content vectors
constructed from the structural representations of the bases.
The MAC stage functions like a document retrieval system,
searching working memory in a parallel manner seeking
content vectors that are similar to the target. The dot product
between each of the bases and the target is computed to
determine the best and those within 10% of the best
matches. Stage two, the FAC stage, utilizes the output from
the MAC phase to do Gentner’s (1983) structure mappings.
The structure mapping engine (SME) selects the best
mapping and all those within 10% of it.

but made for extremely productive and interesting structural
mappings resulting in correct inferences.
Gentner’s (1983; Lowenstein, Thompson, & Gentner,
1999) work suggests that information from abstract and
concrete bases may be processed differently. She has
observed that children find it easier to understand analogies
with concrete bases than with abstract ones. We hope to
investigate this phenomenon using CIRCSIM-Tutor. In our
data in Table 2, we see twenty-two different bases, twelve
are concrete and ten are abstract (Table 3). The use of
abstract bases are observed forty-four times in the corpus,
while the concrete bases are used only fifteen times.
Examination of the language used suggests another
potentially useful classification—into analogies that remind
students of earlier experience with another neural variable
or another procedure and those that depend on a base from
outside the immediate domain.

Conclusion
Analogies are used by our human tutors infrequently; on the
average, less than once a session. However, the human
sessions have demonstrated that the use of analogies is
extremely effective. We have observed tutors using analogy
to tutor the topic at hand and to enhance existing
knowledge. Misunderstandings were corrected and
inappropriate analogies replaced with more suitable ones.
The structure mappings between the analogs underlie what
the tutor was doing.
Future research includes simulating the schemas observed
in the corpus in our expert system CIRCSIM-Tutor
(Michael et al., 2003). Many of the analogies observed can
be implemented using structure mapping (Gentner, 1983,
1998; Goldblum, 2001; Holyoak & Thagard, 1995) to
connect new knowledge to existing knowledge. We will
attempt to simulate mutual alignment (Gentner,
Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003; Loewenstein, Thompson,
& Gentner, 1999) for the most commonly found analogy in
the corpus—another neurally controlled variable. The
recommendations of Goldblum (2001), and Holyoak &
Thagard (1995)—use more than one analog, detect and fix
incorrect mappings, identify the analogical scope, and refine
analogies—will also be attempted.

Implementation
Holyoak & Thagard (1995) identified the steps of analogical
reasoning: the retrieval of possible analogs from memory,
the mapping of these analogs to the new knowledge being
learned, inferring something from the mapping, adjusting
the new knowledge if necessary, and storing the new
knowledge for future use. Computational models dealing
with analogy address the first two steps—retrieval based on
similarity and structural mapping. There are two dominating
models for the retrieval step—case based reasoning
(Birnbaum & Collins, 1989; Kass, 1990, 1994; Kolodner,
1984, 1993, 1994; Schank, 1982) and a model that emulates
a document retrieval system, retrieving both relevant
analogs and irrelevant ones. There are also two approaches
to the mapping step. One makes inferences before the
mappings—projection first—the other makes the mappings
before the predictions—alignment first.
It is our goal to implement an analogy generating function
in CIRCSIM-Tutor (Michael, Rovick, Glass, Zhou, &
Evens, 2003). It has been decided that a document retrieval
model coupled with an alignment-first mapping—
MAC/FAC—(Gentner, 1998; Gentner & Markman, 1997;
Forbus, Gentner, Everett, & Wu, 1997) was best suited for
use when simulating human tutoring in CIRCSIM-Tutor
System. MAC/FAC was chosen because we believe that it
simulates how people process analogies and it the
implementation is very successful.
