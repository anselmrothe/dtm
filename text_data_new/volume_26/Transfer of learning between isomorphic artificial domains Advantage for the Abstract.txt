include both physical manipulatives as well as
specific instantiations of abstract concepts. They are
often perceptually rich and meaningful. Mathematical
concepts are traditionally represented in an abstract
symbolic form, while applications of the mathematics
to scientific and real-world scenarios can be thought
of as concrete instances of the abstract concept.
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
(NCTM) reform movement launched in 1989
promoted the role of such representations in the
curriculum. For example, Dienes blocks (Dienes,
1960) are used in elementary mathematics education
to teach arithmetic and place value. Dienes blocks are
concrete proportional representations of the base-ten
number system. The belief of educators who use the
blocks is that through their use, young children will
not only be able to represent and execute arithmetic
problems, but will also be able to gain insight into the
structure of the base-ten number system (Fuson &
Briars, 1990).
Much support for the use of either concrete
manipulatives or concretely situated applications in
the learning of mathematics comes from
constructivist educators. Cobb, Yackel, and Wood
(1992) propose that students actively construct
mathematical knowledge in social contexts.
Furthermore, they suggest that topics which are
applications of mathematics such as those from realworld or scientific situations provide good initial
instructional activities. That is, instruction of
mathematical concepts should be initiated through
applications of the mathematics as opposed to
initiated in symbolic form.

Abstract
Transfer between isomorphic domains was
investigated. Thirty college undergraduate students
learned two isomorphic artificial systems. One system
was concrete in the sense that it was perceptually rich
and dynamic, while the other was abstract, involving
written symbols. The results show significant positive
transfer from the abstract domain to the concrete
domain and no significant transfer from the concrete
to the abstract.

Introduction
One of the goals of successful learning is transfer,
or the ability to apply acquired knowledge outside the
learned situation. Although a desired outcome of
learning, spontaneous transfer is notoriously difficult
to achieve. In the past few decades, numerous studies
document poor or non-existent spontaneous transfer
across isomorphic situations (Ben-Zeev & Star, 2001;
Gholson et al., 1997; Holyoak, Junn, & Billman,
1984; Holyoak & Koh, 1987; Schoenfeld &
Herrmann, 1982). Poor performance has been
attributed to surface features distracting from
underlying structure.
Which aspects of the learning situation facilitate
transfer? A widely held belief in the education
community has been that learning and transfer of
mathematical and scientific knowledge is facilitated
by the use of concrete representations of more
abstract mathematical and scientific principles. In
the past several decades, the use of concrete
representations has been a growing part of the
mathematics curriculum. Concrete representations

with both of these domains) learned one of these
topics and then were posed word problems involving
the other topic. The measure of transfer was whether
the learned method had been applied to the
structurally isomorphic problems in the unstudied
domain. Students who had learned arithmeticprogression first easily and spontaneously applied the
learned method to correctly solve constantacceleration problems. However, the students who
learned the physics topic showed essentially no
transfer of method to the arithmetic-progression
problems. The results of this study suggest that
transfer is more likely to occur from a more abstract
instantiation to a concrete isomorph.
While the Bassok and Holyoak study (1989)
certainly implies that more transfer occurs from
abstract to concrete domains, confounds in the study
limit such a broad conclusion. The chosen topics in
mathematics and physics, as any mathematical and
physical topics, do not exist in isolation. Any
individual has many associations with each, including
related prior learning as well as attitudes and beliefs.
Specifically, the amount of mathematics learned
through elementary, middle, and high school is
significantly more than the amount of physics
learned. This disparity of learning most likely exists
between mathematics and any of its isomorphic
applications. Furthermore, through the course of
education, students develop an expectation that
mathematical concepts can effectively and
appropriately be applied to other domains such as
physics, chemistry, economics, to name just a few. It
is doubtable that student have as strong expectations
that scientific strategies can be used to solve purely
mathematical problems.
The purpose of this study was to investigate
transfer across two isomorphic domains: one that
used a set of abstract symbols, and another that used
concrete perceptually-rich objects. To eliminate
potential confounds stemming from prior knowledge,
both domains were artificially constructed to be
algebraic Abelian groups of order three. In other
words, each is isomorphic to the integers under
addition modulo three. Therefore, both domains
included three classes of entities and a set of specific
transformation rules described in Figure 1. The first,
more abstract, domain (hereafter “Mathematics”) was
presented to the participants as a symbolic language
in which three types of symbols, denoted as 6, 7,
and , combine to yield a resulting symbol. The
combination of symbols is expressed as written
statements such as , 7 → 6. The second, more
concrete, domain (hereafter “Science”) involved
interactions between three-dimensional objects from
three classes. The objects dynamically interact to
form a resulting object. The appearance of the objects

These approaches to learning and transfer seem to
echo the Piagetian theory, according to which
education should parallel the process of cognitive
development, and the ability for abstraction is not
achieved before the formal operational stage
(Inhelder & Piaget, 1958). At the same time,
children’s reasoning during the preceding stage (i.e.,
the concrete operational stage) was said to be limited
to objects and physically possible situations. If
learning parallels the process of development, then
transfer from more concrete to more abstract
representations should be more efficient than the
reverse.
However, there are strong reasons to doubt this
view. First, it has been demonstrated that concrete,
perceptually rich objects are more likely to be
considered objects than symbols denoting other
entities (DeLoache, 1987; 2000). In a series of
studies by DeLoache and colleagues, very young
children were shown the location of a toy in either a
photograph or a physical model of a scale room.
They were then asked to retrieve the toy from the
actual room. Almost all (88%) of the children shown
the photograph were able to make an errorless
retrieval of the toy, while only 16% of the children
shown the physical model were able to do so. When
the model was placed behind a screen, children’s
retrieval rate improved. Furthermore, slightly older
children are very successful in this task. However,
when older children were encouraged to play with the
model, performance dropped significantly. These
studies demonstrate that children have difficulty
treating perceptually rich objects as symbols.
Decreasing the salience of the object increased the
ease of its symbolic use.
Second, there is a large body of literature on
analogy (analogy is variant of transfer of knowledge
from one domain to another) indicating that
properties that are not a part of to-be-learned
knowledge (i.e., surface features) may hinder rather
than facilitate learning (e.g., Ross, 1987; 1989).
Third, there is recent evidence that there might be a
competition between abstract and concrete
representations of the same situation, and salient
concrete representations may distract learners from
more abstract regularities (Goldstone & Sakamoto,
2003).
Finally, there is evidence that transfer from abstract
instantiations of knowledge may be in fact easier than
transfer from concrete to abstract instantiations
(Bassok & Holyoak, 1989). Bassok and Holyoak
examined transfer between more abstract algebraic
knowledge and more concrete physics knowledge,
namely between arithmetic-progression problems and
isomorphic constant-acceleration problems. High
school and college students (who were unfamiliar

and interactions was designed to be dissimilar to any
particular science.
The goal of the reported experiment was to
investigate transfer across the two isomorphic
artificial domains. Transfer was measured by
comparing average test scores on a given domain as a
function of prior learning of another domain.

Information about each domain was given as a
computer presentation. The training in both domains
was essentially isomorphic. The rules of the domain,
namely commutativity, associativity, and the rules
governing specific elements, were explicitly stated.
The experiment included four phases presented
over one hour: (1) Training in domain X, (2) Test in
domain X, (3) Training in domain Y, (4) Test in
domain Y, with participants randomly assign to a
particular order of learning (i.e., math-then-science or
science-then-math).
Training included introduction of transformation
rules, followed by questions with feedback. Several
detailed examples were given. Testing consisted of
twenty multiple choice questions designed to
measure recall of the given rules and deeper
conceptual understanding of the system. For both
domains, the test questions were completely
isomorphic and were presented in the same order.
The presentation of the two domains differed by
storyline. The artificial mathematics was presented as
a symbolic language discovered on an archaeological
search. Symbols of different categories combine to
yield a resulting symbol. The artificial science was
explained to be a phenomenon observed on a planet
outside of our solar system. Objects from different
classes of shapes interact to form a resulting shape.
The presentation of the artificial science included
movie clips demonstrating the interactions. Two or
more objects move toward each other. When they
come in contact, an interaction occurs and results in a
predictable object.
Each subject was randomly assigned to one of two
orders: math-then-science (MÆSc) or science-thenmath (ScÆM). Participants in the first group received
training and testing in the artificial mathematics
immediately followed by training and testing in the
artificial science. Subjects in the second group
received training and testing first in the science and
then in the mathematics. Following training and
testing in both domains, a brief interview was
conducted.
Students’ scores on the mathematics and science
tests were recorded. They were also asked to rate the
similarity of the two domains on a scale from one to
five. A rating of one indicated that the domains are
completely different and a rating of five indicated
that the domains are structurally identical with
different representations of the objects.
Test scores for mathematics and science were
compared across the two conditions, math-thenscience and science-then-math. Transfer due to
mathematics first was taken to be the difference in
the average science score for MÆSc and the average
science score for ScÆM. In other words, transfer is
the improvement in science score due to having

Results and Discussion

Science

The higher average science score for the MÆ Sc
group suggests that their prior knowledge of the
mathematics improved their learning of the science.
Therefore, significant transfer was found from the
abstract symbolic domain to the concrete, but the
reverse was not found.
In order to understand why the symbolic
representation promoted transfer, while the concrete
representation did not, it is necessary to take a closer
look at the process of transfer. Not only does transfer
require recognition and mapping of analogous
relational structure from a source domain to a target
domain, the elements of the source domain need to
act as symbols. In other words, the objects or aspects
of the source domain need to act as placeholders that
can refer to something else, namely the objects of the
target domain. Concrete representations are
perceptually rich and consequently engage the
perceptual system. Perceptually rich representations
can easily convey associated properties and overall
similarity (Goldstone & Barsalou, 1998). However,
the specific characteristics of objects or elements are
often irrelevant to concepts. Maintaining dissociation
between the relational structure and the
characteristics of the given elements is often crucial
to accurate analogical reasoning. The salience of
surface attributes often misleads students in the
course of problem solving by distracting them from
the underlying structure (Ben-Zeev & Star, 2001;
Gholson, Smither, Buhrman, Duncan, & Pierce,
1997; Holyoak, Junn, & Billman, 1984; Holyoak &
Koh, 1987; Schoenfeld & Herrmann, 1982).
Perceptual objects convey affordances that may be
helpful, but may also be irrelevant to the underlying
concepts.
However, concrete representations may be
beneficial under some conditions. For example
Goldstone and colleagues (Goldstone, Son, & Patton,
under review) have argued that maximum transfer
occurs through “concreteness fading” where concrete
representations progressively become idealized.

Students were able to learn the artificial
mathematics and the artificial science. With the
exception of one student, all test scores were
significantly above chance (i.e., 7/20) in both maththen-science and science-then-math conditions. The
one student who had a science score of 9/20 was
removed from the data analysis. This score is not
significantly different than chance and is also greater
than two standard deviations from the mean (mean =
16.8, standard deviation = 2.8).
All students indicated that they noticed similarities
between the two topics. Under both conditions the
students rated the domains as highly similar. On a
similarity scale from one to five, the mean rating
given by math-then-science participants was 4.4 (SD
= .65). The mean rating given by science-then-math
students was 4.6 (SD = .63).
The data on transfer across the domains are
presented in Figure 1. These data were subjected to a
2 (Domain: Math vs. Science) by 2 (Order: Learned
First vs. Learned Second) mixed ANOVA with
Domain as a repeated measure.
The analysis
revealed a significant Domain by Order interaction, F
(1, 27) = 24.15, p < .0001. At the same time, none of
the main effects was significant, both ps > .28.
Planned comparisons indicated that there was a
significant difference in performance as a function of
learning order. Students in the math-then-science
condition performed significantly better on the
science test than students in the science-then-math
condition, independent-samples t (24) = 3.26, p<.01.
However, there was no significant difference in
mathematics scores across conditions, p > .229.

Participants in both the math-then-science and the
science-then-math conditions recognized similarities
between the domains. However, only the students
who learned the symbolic mathematics prior to the
concrete science were able to transfer information

The conclusions of their study were that transfer is
promoted
through
multiple
representations.
Furthermore, the authors conclude that while
idealized displays promote internal representation not
deeply embedded in a single domain, concrete
displays have the advantage of a strong intuitive link
between the real world and the modeled world. In
other words, concepts can get a partial free ride from
familiar concrete instances. However, in the course of
learning mathematics and science, there are many
concepts for which obvious concrete models may not
exist. In the absence of a familiar concrete model on
which concepts can freeload, does an artificially
constructed concrete representation have benefits
over a symbolic representation?
This notion of concepts getting a free ride from
concrete representations as suggested by Goldstone
and his colleagues is certainly appealing and is
intuitively very reasonable. From a pedagogical
perspective, there seems to be definite merit in
concreteness fading provided that instructors do not
allow learning to become deeply embedded in the
concrete example. For students, the concept may
become the concrete model and not the abstraction
necessary for true understanding and transfer.
Furthermore, many concepts may not have obvious
and familiar representation in the real world.
Mathematical concepts, by their very nature, are not
bound to concrete contexts. Their transfer depends on
attending to their relational structure and not salient
surface features of a particular instance.
The goal of this experiment was to take a closer
look at the merits of abstraction and concreteness for
transfer. The familiarity or intuitive link between the
concrete model and the concept were intentionally
removed. No significant transfer from the concrete to
the abstract was found, while significant transfer
from the abstract to the concrete was exhibited.
Concrete representations may be difficult to treat
as symbols in novel, complex concepts. Perceptually
rich representations convey more information than
leaner representations. As the degree of richness
increases, it likely becomes more difficult to
recognize the representation as an object itself as well
as a reference to its intended referent. Successful
transfer requires the elements of the source domain to
be treated as symbols. Concrete representations
engage the perceptual system. Rich percepts convey
much information, a large portion of which is
unrelated to a task in question. When that information
correlates with the conceptual structure, learning may
be facilitated. However, when the attributes are
irrelevant to the concept, learners may not see the
relevant analogy. Even when the analogy is
perceived, it is difficult for rich percepts to be used as
symbols, as demonstrated in this experiment.
