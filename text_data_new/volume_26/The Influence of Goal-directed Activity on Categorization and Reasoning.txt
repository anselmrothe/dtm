to expert-novice comparisons.
Inter-expert research has found that experts with different
specializations in a domain may categorize and reason about
domain-related information in characteristically different
ways. For example, Medin, Lynch, Coley, and Atran (1997)
found that different types of tree experts (taxonomists,
landscapers, and maintenance workers) organized the same
set of familiar tree species in distinct ways. Of particular
interest is their finding that both landscapers and
maintenance workers formed categories of trees based on
their goal-related properties, such as, “weediness,”
“landscape utility,” and “aesthetics.” Moreover, in a
subsequent inductive reasoning task maintenance workers
made a number of inductive inferences consistent with their
goal-related categorizations of the tree species. Proffitt et al.
(2000) found that tree experts would often rely on causalecological relations over taxonomic relations in making
inferences in their domain of expertise. As noted by Medin
et al. (1997), the categories utilized by some types of tree
experts closely resemble the goal-derived categories
described by Barsalou (e.g., 1991): They crosscut the
scientific/taxonomic organization of the domain and appear
to be assembled around ideal attribute values.

Abstract
Studies of experts with different specialties in a domain suggest
that goals may play an important role in category learning and
inductive reasoning. Little experimental research, however, has
addressed the potential influence of goal-directed activity on such
processes. In the current study naïve participants acquire and
utilize knowledge about a novel natural kind domain over a
number of experimental sessions. Different groups of participants
utilize different goals in their interactions with the experimental
items. Participants utilizing a goal that requires the use of a certain
subset of item features are found to develop categories around
these features. Moreover, in a subsequent inductive reasoning task,
these same participants perform in a manner that is highly
consistent with the use of a goal-related category structure.

Introduction
Several researchers have encouraged a broadening of the
methodology that has long predominated the psychological
study of human categorization (e.g., Barsalou, 1991;
Markman, & Ross, 2003; Medin, Ross, Atran, Burnett, &
Blok, 2002; Murphy, 2002; Shafto, & Coley, 2003;
Solomon, Medin, & Lynch, 1999). It is argued that
categorization is implicated in a number of cognitive
processes, such as, problem solving (Chi, Feltovich, &
Glaser, 1981; Ross, 1996), inductive reasoning (Osherson,
Smith, Wilkie, Lopez, & Shafir, 1990; Proffitt, Medin, &
Coley, 2000), and communication (Solomon et al., 1999;
Markman & Ross, 2003), hence the study of categorization
ought to reflect its multifaceted character. One area of
research that has exemplified this broadened approach is the
study of experts. These are individuals with extensive
knowledge and experience in a given domain, such as,
chess, medicine, birds, or trees.
Traditionally, studies of expertise have attempted to
design tasks that elicit superior performances from experts
in laboratory conditions so it may be systematically
analyzed (Ericsson, & Smith, 1991). In most cases the
performance of experts is compared with the performance of
non-experts, typically recruited from undergraduate
populations. However, recent research suggests that
comparisons among experts with different specialties in a
single domain may also provide valuable insight into the
nature of expertise. With regard to theories of
categorization, such comparisons could help to identify
factors that contribute to the organization of conceptual
knowledge that may be masked when research is restricted

Exploring the Influence of Goal Use
The above studies suggest that the nature of a domain,
like trees, is but one factor contributing to the category
structures that individuals form for it. It follows that
research focusing exclusively on the effects of category
structure on category learning may be missing an important
aspect of this learning process (see also Markman & Ross,
2003). It may be that the influence of goal-directed activity
on category learning is quite extensive, perhaps veiled by
the characteristic ways in which members of a culture
interact with the world. Indeed, cross-cultural studies have
identified variations in categorization that may be related to
such differences (e.g., Medin et al., 2002).
It is clear that evidence of cross-cultural and inter-expert
variation in categorization and reasoning pose substantial
challenges to the prevailing paradigm in categorization
research. However, it is notoriously difficult to identify the
causes of such variability. Numerous differences clearly
exist between cultural groups, and even studies of different
expert specialists from the same culture cannot control for
differing experiences with the members of a domain.

630

Moreover, the relations between domain structure and
domain use are likely to be highly complex. For instance,
morphological properties can be related to both the
taxonomic status of an object as well as its utility. Because
domain structure and use are parameters that may vary
freely in the real world, it is challenging to interpret crosscultural and inter-expert comparisons. For these reasons
experimentation is needed to isolate the roles played by
these different factors.
Ross’ recent work (e.g., 1996, 2000) represents an attempt
to utilize experimental tasks to investigate the influence of
goals on categorization, focusing particularly on the relation
between categories and problem solving (cf. Chi et al.,
1981). This research has demonstrated that the use of a
category can alter its representation by enhancing the
perceived importance of use-related features. For instance,
in the domain of medical diagnosis, participants that learned
that certain disease symptoms were good predictors of a
treatment also perceived these symptoms as more diagnostic
of the disease, even though they were no more diagnostic
than other features that accompanied them. This research
has primarily investigated how use affects an alreadylearned category. Thus, it is an unsettled question as to how
goal-directed interaction affects category formation,
particularly in natural kind domains. Examining the effects
of goal-directed activity on inductive reasoning would
provide an interesting extension of this line of research.

Method
Participants
Eight undergraduates from the University of Illinois at
Chicago participated in this study to fulfill a course
requirement. Participants were run individually. Four
participants were randomly assigned to each condition.

Materials/tasks
Experimental stimuli. A set of 16 artificial Creatures was
designed such that it could be sorted into three structurally
equivalent hierarchies on the basis of three different feature
types: Features related to Avoiding Predators (AP), Features
NOT related to Avoiding Predators1 (NAP), and Pictoriallyrepresented features (PR). The PR features were represented
in an illustration of the Creature, while the AP and NAP
features were written in point form below the illustration
(see Figure 1).

Overview
To examine the effects of goal-directed activity on
categorization and inductive reasoning, the present study
exposes naïve participants to an artificial natural kind
domain (the “Creatures”). Over a four-session learning
phase, these participants acquire knowledge about the
different types of features possessed by the Creatures and
use this knowledge to assess the Creatures according to a
particular goal. These goals are manipulated between
groups: One group is given a goal that directs them to utilize
a certain subset of the Creatures’ features, while the other
group is given a goal that does not direct them to utilize any
subset of features over another. Changes in categorization
are assessed by having participants sort the Creatures both
before and after the learning phase. An induction task is
used to assess how goal-directed activity influences
reasoning about the domain.
It is hypothesized that the performance of goal-directed
activities will influence participants’ categorizations and
reasoning, but only in the case where participants must
utilize a certain subset of the Creatures’ features to perform
the goal-related tasks. If these participants learn to reorganize their domain knowledge around ideal (i.e., goalrelevant) features, then a category structure that is based on
goal-related features should provide a good account of their
categorizations and their inductive inferences.

were in color.
Fourteen features of each type were distributed among the
Creatures according to the structures in Figure 2. The
dendrograms in Figure 2 show that for each feature type
(AP, NAP, and PR), eight of the features are possessed by
2/16 Creatures, four of the features by 4/16, and two of the
features by 8/16. These dendrograms can be understood as
ideal category structures for each feature type – that is, they
represent the three different category structures that would
be formed by using each of the three different feature types.
It is of interest to compare participants’ categorizations with
these ideal structures.

These features were coherently related to another goal: assessing
the Creatures according to how well they would serve as a source
of nutrition. Participants in this experiment were not informed of
this other goal.

avoiding predators (NAP – see footnote 1). For example,
participants had to learn that a “thin penactic stomach
lining” means that the Creature cannot dig holes for hiding,
and that a “small vestibular artery” means that the Creature
has low vitamin C levels. Participants were permitted to
study this information at their own pace.
2. Feature Memory Test. This test was designed to
determine whether participants had learned the information
about the features from the feature learning task. This
computerized test consisted of 14 multiple choice questions
about Creature features. Participants were required to retake the test until they completed it without error. They were
given up to 5 attempts per day. Four versions of this task
were constructed. Each version contained the same
questions, but with a different ordering of both questions
and options.
Goal-directed Activity. The main task for the majority of
the experiment was a Creature Assessment task. The task
combined memory and decision making about the creatures.
Students performed this task on days 2-5. At the beginning
of each trial of this task, the subject was shown a Creature
card on a computer screen for 10 s. Following this display
the subject completed a 2-page assessment form. On page 1
the subject checked boxes next to the features possessed by
the Creature that was just displayed. Participants in the AP
condition were asked to check only the boxes next to the
Creature’s features that are relevant to avoiding predators.
Participants in the C condition were asked to check the
boxes next to all of the Creature’s features. On page 2 of the
assessment form the subject responded to 3 questions.
Participants in the AP condition were asked: (1) Do you
think the Creature that you were just shown will be good at
avoiding predators in the habitat? (2) What about the
Creature influenced your decision? (3) Rate the Creature on
a scale of 1-10 according to how good it is likely to be at
avoiding predators. Participants in the C condition were
asked: (1) Do you think the Creature that you were just
shown will be difficult to recall later on? (2) What about the
Creature influenced your decision? (3) Rate your memory
for the Creature on a scale of 1-10, according to how
difficult it is likely to be to remember it. Following
completion of the response form, the subject advanced the
screen and the next item was displayed. Each of the 16
Creatures was shown in a different order once per day.

features NOT related to Avoiding Predators, and (C)
Pictorially-represented features.
Goal Information. The independent variable in this study
was whether or not participants were given a goal requiring
them to utilize a certain subset of Creature features. All
participants were informed that a large corporation had
purchased an island habitat, and they want to introduce the
Creatures to it. Participants in Group AP (Avoid Predators)
were told that the corporation was interested in maximizing
the survival of the Creatures on the island, and that they
wanted to determine which Creatures would be best suited
for avoiding predators. Participants in Group C (Control)
were told that the corporation was interested in cataloguing
the Creatures, and wanted to determine which Creatures
would be easiest to monitor. Participants in both conditions
were told that the corporation had hired them as a
consultant, and that their job was to assess the Creatures
according to either: (a) how well-suited they are for
avoiding predators (Group AP) or (b) how easy they will be
to recall (Group C). Participants were informed that the
Creatures’ features would be useful for making their
assessments, and that they would learn more about the
Creatures’ features at the next session of the experiment.
Pre-training Tasks. Before engaging in goal-directed
activities, participants had to be familiarized with the
features that they would utilize. This pre-training is
important in ensuring that differences between the two goal
groups are not due to differences in familiarity with and
knowledge of the features. The pre-training consisted of
two parts, a learning phase and a test phase.
1. Feature Learning Task. In this task participants were
required to study several computer screens of information
about the Creatures’ features and their relations to other
properties. Half of these properties were coherently related
to avoiding predators (AP) and half were not related to

Dependent Measures. Two dependent measures were used
to assess changes in categorization and reasoning about the
Creatures. A sorting task (the Category Construction Task)
was administered both before and after the training sessions.
An Inference task was given on the final day of the
experiment.
1. Category Construction Task. In this task, participants
were asked to construct categories using the 16 Creature
cards. Before sorting the cards, the subject was shown each
card one-by-one for about two seconds. Following this
initial exposure the Creature cards were randomly arrayed

632

on a table in front of the subject. The subject was instructed
to find the “best way” to organize the cards. First, the
subject was asked to form 8 pairs of Creatures and to
provide justification for each group that they made. Second,
the subject was asked to form 4 groups of 4 Creatures using
the pairs that they constructed, and to provide further
justifications. Finally, the subject was asked to combine the
4 groups of Creatures into 2 groups of 8 Creatures, and to
provide justifications. This task was performed on both Day
1 and Day 6 of the experiment. On Day 6 the participants
were instructed to use their knowledge of the Creatures
when constructing categories, and they were not shown each
card one-by-one as on Day 1. Otherwise, the procedure was
the same on each day.
2. Inference Task. In this task participants were presented
with a Creature on a computer screen and informed that the
item has been found to possess a novel feature, “Sarca.” The
original item was removed after 10 s and 2 different
Creatures were then shown. The subject was then asked to
decide which of them is most likely to also possess the
novel feature attributed to the first item. Following their
response a blank screen was displayed for 2 s, followed by
the next trial. Participants received two types of trials in
which a more pictorially similar option (the PR option) was
competed with either a more AP-related or NAP-related
option. In AP vs. PR trials one option shared one more PR
feature with the original item than did the other option. This
other option, however, had one more AP-related feature in
common with the original. Importantly, both options had
exactly the same NAP-related features in common with the
original. Thus, these trials tested whether participants would
infer that the novel property would be more likely to
generalize to a Creature that is more pictorially similar or
one that is more similar with respect to AP properties.
NAP vs. PR trials were analogously designed to compete an
option sharing more PR features with one sharing more
NAP-related features. The number of AP vs. PR and NAP
vs. PR trials was matched. Trial order was randomized to
create a single task list that was administered to all
participants.

Results
Feature Memory Test. Figure 3 displays the mean number
of blocks (test attempts) to criterion across the four days that
the test was administered. A 2 (Group) x 4 (Day) repeated
measures ANOVA was conducted on the mean number of
blocks to criterion. Participants that did not reach criterion
on a given day were given a default score of 6 (five being
the maximum number of attempts permitted). Across the
first 3 days there were five instances in which a subject did
not reach criterion, but by day 4 all participants reached
criterion in 4 trials or less. The ANOVA revealed a
significant effect of Day, F(3, 18) = 11.61, MSE = 1.09, p <
.01, with no main effect of Group F(1, 6) = 1.06, MSE =
6.62, ns, and no interaction between Day and Group, F(3,
18) = 1.95, MSE = 1.09, ns. A follow-up comparison
revealed a significant difference between the number of
blocks to criterion required on Day 1 (M = 4.6) and Day 4
(M = 1.9), F(1, 18) = 27.5, MSE = 1.10, p < .01. These
findings indicate that participants required fewer attempts to
reach criterion by the final day.

Feature Memory Task

Procedure
The pattern of change in the number of blocks to criterion
is consistent with the decline in error rates across days (see
Figure 4). A 2 (Group) x 4 (Day) repeated measures
ANOVA was conducted on mean error rates. This ANOVA
revealed a significant effect of Day, F(3, 18) = 9.16, MSE =
0.002, p < .01, with no main effect of Group F(1, 6) = 1.62,
MSE = 0.005, ns, and no Day x Group interaction, F(3, 18)
= 0.68, MSE = 0.002, ns. A follow-up comparison revealed
a significant difference between the error rates on Day 1 (M
= 0.13) and Day 4 (M = 0.04), F(1, 18) = 18.0, MSE =
0.002, p < .01. These findings indicate that participants’
accuracy on the Memory Test improved across the four days
it was administered. Examination of the decrease in both
blocks to criterion and error rate across days provides

The experiment took place on six consecutive weekdays
(participants were not run on weekends). On day 1,
participants performed the category construction task and
received information about their goal. On day 2, participants
learned about the properties related to the Creatures’
features and subsequently completed the first version of the
feature test. Participants then completed assessments of the
Creatures, either with respect to how well suited they would
be for avoiding predators (Group AP) or with respect to how
easy it would be to recall them later on (Group C). Days 3-5
were the same in format. On these days, participants
completed different versions of both the feature test and
Creature assessments. Finally, on day 6 they completed the
category construction task followed by the inference task.

final performance of the task, these participants produced
category structures that are still significantly correlated with
the APi structure, but are not significantly correlated with
the PRi structure. Group AP’s categories also have a high
correlation with PRi at the initial stage, but unlike Group C
they do not evidence a significant correlation with APi.
However, at the final stage Group AP shows a high
correlation with APi and a nonsignificant correlation with
PRi. In summary, both groups appear to shift away from
using PR features in their final category constructions, but
only the participants in Group AP show an increased
relation to APi.

retained information related to all features.

Category Construction Task. Treatment of the category
construction data closely follows Medin et al. (1997) and
Shafto and Coley (2003). Participants’ categorizations of the
Creatures were converted to dendrograms (see Figure 2).
Each subject’s dendrogram was then used to derive a 16 x
16 pairwise distance matrix. A number was assigned to each
cell of the matrix corresponding to the level in the
dendrogram at which the pair of Creatures was combined.
Creatures paired together at the lowest level (i.e., when the
subject was instructed to make pairs of Creatures) were
assigned a distance of 1; Creatures paired at the next level
(groups of 4) were assigned a distance of 2; Creatures at the
highest level (groups of 8) were assigned a 3; Creatures
NOT paired at any level were assigned a default distance of
4. Only the 120 unique cells above the diagonal were used
in subsequent analyses because of their redundancy with the
cells below and because the cells on the diagonal (the
distance between a Creature and itself) are irrelevant.
Distances were averaged across participants in each group
to create four different matrices representing initial and final
category construction for Group C (C-1 and C-2) and AP
(AP-1 and AP-2). Initial and final matrices for each group
were correlated with one another and with the matrices
derived from the ideal category structures (Figure 2).
Table 1 displays the correlations between the ideal
category structures (APi, NAPi, and PRi) and the initial and
final structures for each group (C-1, C-2, AP-1, and AP-2).
The first thing to note in Table 1 is the relatively low
intercorrelations among the ideal structures. This implies
that a high correlation between a group structure and an
ideal structure cannot be attributed to covariance among the
ideal structures. Turning to the performance of the two
groups, it is evident that on average participants in Group C
initially sorted the Creatures in ways that were highly
correlated with both the APi and PRi structures. In their

Inference Task. Participants’ choices were scored
according to whether they were consistent with the use of
non-pictorial information. Thus, in the AP vs. PR trials the
participant’s choice was scored as a 1 if they chose the APrelated option and a 0 if they chose the PR option. In NAP
vs. PR trials, NAP choices were scored as a 1, PR choices as
0. The mean proportion of non-PR choices was calculated
for participants for each trial type. Figure 5 displays the
mean proportion of non-PR choices for each trial type. A 2
(Group) x 2 (Trial Type) repeated measures ANOVA
revealed no main effect of Trial Type, F(1, 14) = 2.0, MSE
= 0.05, ns, and a main effect of Group, F(1, 14) = 36.7, MSE
= 0.031, p < .01, however, there was also a significant
Group x Trial Type interaction, F(1, 14) = 6.58, MSE =
0.002, p < .05.
Of primary interest is the comparison between the mean
proportions of non-PR choices for each trial type with the
proportion expected by chance (.50). For Group AP, the
mean proportion of non-PR choices was significantly higher
that chance on the AP vs. PR trials, t(19) = 5.15, p < .01, but
did not differ from chance on the NAP vs. PR trials, t(18) =
0.35, ns. For Group C, the mean proportion of non-PR
choices was marginally lower than chance on the AP vs. PR
trials, t(19) = 2.04, p < .10, but did not differ from chance
on the NAP vs. PR trials, t(18) = 0.98, ns. Thus, participants
in Group AP most often generalized a novel property to a
Creature more similar with respect to AP properties, but
performed at chance level when AP-related similarity did
not distinguish the two options. Participants in Group C did

not show this pattern, and evidenced a slight tendency
toward the PR option in the AP vs. PR trials.

Summary and Discussion
The main hypothesis of this experiment was that the
utilization of a certain subset of Creature features in a goaldirected task would influence categorization and reasoning.
It was further predicted that an ideal goal-related category
structure would account well for the performances of these
participants.
The results of the category construction task are
consistent with these predictions. The APi structure
correlated highly with Group AP’s final categorizations.
Even though Group C’s categorizations also correlated
highly with APi, this correlation showed no increase from
this group’s initial performance. The APi structure also
accounts well for Group AP’s performance on the inference
task. When the APi structure distinguished between the two
options, the participants often chose the AP-related
Creature, when the APi structure did not distinguish the two
options, participants performed at chance level. Altogether
these findings suggest that participants in Group AP
developed categories organized around a particular subset of
goal-related Creature properties (AP-related properties).
Participants in Group C did not evidence such change. By
controlling the frequency of participants’ exposure to the
domain as well as its structure, the differences between
groups can be attributed to differences in the goal-directed
tasks that each group performed.
This research is still in its early stages and would surely
benefit from increasing the sample size and adding further
tests of participants’ new domain knowledge. Nevertheless,
the findings of this experiment serve to highlight the role
that goal-directed activity could play in categorization.
Given the extensive and varied nature of such activity
