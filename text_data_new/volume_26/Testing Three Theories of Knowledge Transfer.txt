Abstract
Three theories of knowledge transfer -- analogy, knowledge
compilation, and constraint violation -- were tested across
three transfer scenarios. Each theory was shown to predict
human performance in distinct and identifiable ways on a
variety of transfer tasks. Results support the hypothesis that
there are multiple mechanisms of transfer and that a general
theory of transfer must incorporate each mechanism in
principled ways.

Introduction
In order to understand human thinking and problem solving
in complex and novel situations we need to have a general
theory for how people use and adapt their prior knowledge to
solve new problems. Aspirations towards such a goal have
traditionally been discussed in terms of transfer, or how
knowledge acquired from one task or situation can be
applied to a different situation (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999;
Detterman & Sternberg, 1993; Salomon & Perkins, 1989).
Work in cognitive science over the past thirty years has
progressed towards this goal by investigating separate
strands of transfer phenomena that occur in particular
learning and problem solving situations. Although this
research strategy has proven successful in developing local,
independent explanations of knowledge transfer for
particular experimental scenarios (e.g., analogical transfer
and transfer appropriate processing), it has done little to
bring us closer to a general theory of transfer. It is time to
begin to weave these separate strands of investigation into a
more complete theory that incorporates each strand in
principled ways.
It is this charge of theoretical synthesis that motivates
the two hypotheses under investigation in the current study.
First, it is proposed that there is no single knowledge transfer
mechanism, but multiple ones. These mechanisms include
(but are not limited to) analogy, knowledge compilation, and
error correction. Second, the particular transfer mechanism
used depends on both (a) the knowledge actually present and
how it is represented, and (b) the processing demands of the
transfer task.
Below I summarize some of the prior work on transfer
that is relevant to the investigation of these two hypotheses.

Mechanisms of Knowledge Transfer
The first mechanism of interest is analogical transfer
(Gentner, Holyoak, & Kokinov, 2001). Analogical transfer is
composed of three subprocesses: retrieving a prior

knowledge structure, creating a mapping between it and the
current problem or situation, and then using that mapping to
generate new knowledge structures relevant to the
application context. The transferred knowledge is typically
assumed to be a declarative representation, but it can also
include procedural attachments (Chen, 2002).
The empirical evidence for analogical mapping is
extensive (Catrambone & Holyoak, 1989; Gentner &
Toupin, 1986). However, the evidence also shows that
although people are capable of mapping deep relational
structures, the retrieval of an analogue is heavily dependent
upon matches between the surface features of the current
problem and prior problem solving experiences
(Catrambone, 2002; Ross & Kilbane, 1997). Therefore,
analogy is perhaps a better explanation for near transfer than
for far transfer.
The second transfer mechanism of interest is knowledge
compilation proposed by John R. Anderson and co-workers
(Anderson, 1983; Neves & Anderson, 1981). Knowledge
compilation was specifically proposed to explain how
declarative knowledge is brought to bear on problem solving
in the context of the ACT-R theory. This computational
mechanism operates through the deliberate and explicit, stepby-step interpretation of a declarative statement that
generates new production rules as a side effect. Those rules
are then optimized via rule composition and the result is a
procedural representation of the content of the declarative
knowledge given a specific goal.
The knowledge compilation mechanism can be viewed
as a translation device that translates or interprets declarative
knowledge (e.g., advice, instructions, and strategies) into a
set of procedures and actions that can be used to solve
problems. Since knowledge compilation operates on
declarative knowledge it can be used in a wide variety of
application contexts because the knowledge has yet to be
proceduralized, or tied to the goals of a particular problem
solving context. This mechanism embodies a tradeoff
between applicability and efficiency in that it has wide
applicability across many contexts but requires a
complicated and lengthy application process to translate the
declarative knowledge into a set of actions. There is some
empirical support for knowledge compilation but the
evidence is not extensive (Anderson, Greeno, Kline, &
Neves, 1981; Neves & Anderson, 1981).
The third transfer mechanism of interest is Ohlsson’s
(1996) error correction mechanism. Ohlsson and co-workers
(Ohlsson, 1996; Ohlsson & Rees, 1991) have proposed that

1029

the role of declarative knowledge is primarily to help a
learner identify and correct his or her own errors. The
constraint violation theory has both declarative and
procedural components that operate in parallel, and the
function of declarative knowledge is to constrain possible
problem solutions. When incomplete or faulty procedural
knowledge generates undesirable outcomes, these are
recognized as violations of those constraints and the
responsible rules are revised accordingly.
The power of declarative knowledge is that it can help
the learner pinpoint the cause of an error, and transfer is the
process by which errors are identified and remedied. This
mechanism has wide applicability in that the constraints can
be applied to a variety of problems that may require different
strategies or sequences of actions to produce the correct
solution. The constraint violation theory has been shown to
generate power law learning curves (Ohlsson, 1996) and to
support the design of successful tutoring systems (Mitrovic
& Ohlsson, 1999).
In addition to each transfer mechanism using different
cognitive processes, each mechanism has also been
hypothesized to operate on specific types of prior knowledge
structures. Analogy uses exemplar knowledge that consists
of a declarative representation that may also have procedural
attachments (Gentner, 1983). Knowledge compilation uses
declarative knowledge such as instructions, advice, or
tactical knowledge (Anderson, 1983). Error correction uses
declarative knowledge of the constraints for a particular
problem domain (Ohlsson, 1996).
In summary, researchers have proposed multiple
alternative transfer processes including analogy, knowledge
compilation, and error correction. Each mechanism has been
associated with a particular kind of transfer scenario that
specifies the conditions necessary for transfer (i.e., type of
prior knowledge and application context). The purpose of the
current study is to test the predictions of each transfer theory,
and ask whether we can predict what transfer mechanism
will be triggered for a given set of transfer scenarios.

The Present Study
In order to test these theories I implemented a betweengroups training study in which subjects were given one of
three training scenarios (exemplar, tactics, or constraints)
and then were tested on a common set of problem solving
tasks.
Each training scenario was designed to facilitate the
construction of one of the three of the aforementioned
knowledge structures associated with each transfer
mechanism (i.e., exemplars for analogy, tactics for
knowledge compilation, and constraints for error correction).
In the exemplar training condition participants solve
problems similar to those used in the transfer phase. In the
tactical training condition participants learn instructional
tactics for solving the transfer problems. In the constraints
training condition participants learn the constraints
associated with the problem solving task domain.

The transfer task is Thurstone’s letter extrapolation task
(Thurstone & Thurstone, 1941). In this task subjects are
given a sequence of letters containing a pattern and their task
is to find the pattern and continue it. Here is a simple
example, A B M C D M . . . the correct continuation is E F
M G H M. An important aspect of these problems for the
current purposes is that prior declarative and procedural
knowledge can make them easier to solve.
Although letter extrapolation is an invented task, it has
several elements in common with many real world tasks
including: a prior knowledge base (e.g., the alphabet),
conceptual content (e.g., the pattern), materials to study (e.g.,
tactics), and generativity (e.g., one has to generate a
sequence of coordinated actions).
Three different extrapolation problems were used in the
transfer phase. Each problem was constructed with different
properties or affordances, to elicit quantitative (accuracy,
solution time, self-corrected errors) and qualitative (solution
type) differences in performance from each training group.
The first transfer problem was designed to have a
similar surface and deep pattern structure as that used in the
exemplar training problems. This problem can also be solved
by applying either tactical or constraint knowledge. The
second transfer problem is open-ended and depending on
how the given sequence is interpreted, different solution
types are expected. This problem shares the same deep
structure as the exemplar problems. However, the surface
similar characteristics are misaligned and suggest a different
interpretation. If the given sequence is interpreted as similar
to the surface sequence one solution is expected. If it is
interpreted as a deep analogy a second solution is expected.
Tactical knowledge can also be used to solve this problem
and biases one towards the second solution. Constraint
knowledge can be applied as well and does not provide an apriori bias towards any one of the correct solutions. The third
transfer problem has neither surface nor deep structure
similarity to the exemplar problems. The tactics are also not
directly applicable. However, the constraints can be applied
to find a unique solution.
In addition to comparing task performance across
training groups, each training group was compared to a notraining control group for a measure of transfer relative to
baseline performance.

Predictions
Exemplar Training. If participants in this training condition
use exemplar knowledge and analogy to solve the first
transfer problem they are expected to show high accuracy
and fast solution times with few error-correcting behaviors
as compared to the no-training group. They should show fast
solution times for this problem because there is both surface
and deep similarity to the training exemplars (i.e., fast
memory access). They should show few error-correcting
behaviors because they can transfer both declarative and
procedural knowledge from the exemplars. For transfer
problem 2 participants are expected to show high accuracy
with slower solution times and few self-corrected errors. In

1030

addition, they should show a bias for the surface similar
problem solution. For transfer problem 3 they should show
similar performance to no-training participants.
Tactical Training. If participants in this training
condition use tactical knowledge and knowledge compilation
to solve the first two transfer problems they should show
high accuracy but similar solution times and error-correcting
behaviors to that of the no-training group. In addition, for
transfer problem 2 they should show a bias for the tactics
relevant solution. For transfer problem 3 they should show
similar performance to that of the no-training participants.
Constraints Training. If participants use constraint
knowledge and error correction to solve all three transfer
problems they should show high accuracy, similar solution
times, and many error-correcting behaviors compared to the
no-training group. In addition, they should show more
variability in solution types for transfer problem 2.

Methods
Participants
One hundred and twenty-five undergraduate students from
the University of Illinois at Chicago’s subject pool
participated in return for partial course credit.

Materials
Training Materials. The training materials for the exemplar
group consisted of four sequence extrapolation problem
isomorphs. Each problem was presented on a separate sheet
of paper. All four training problems had the same deep
pattern structure as each other and the first two transfer
problems, but each was instantiated with different surface
features. Below are two examples:
Exemplar 1: L M Z M L Y M N X . . .
Exemplar 2: E F S F E R F G Q . . .
The training materials for the tactics group consisted of
a general tutorial, a tactic summary sheet, and several blank
recall sheets. The tutorial (10 pages) provided instruction on
specific kinds of pattern relations including: forward,
mirror-flip, backward, repeat, and identity. Each pattern
relation was defined and multiple examples were given. The
tactics summary sheet consisted of one pattern continuing
tactic and four pattern finding tactics including: (1) look for
mirror flips or periods to break apart the pattern, (2) repeated
letters may signal a mirror-flip order of symbols, group
repeat, or period marker, (3) letters that are far apart in the
alphabet may signal a mirror-flip alphabet, (4) letters close
together may signal backward or forward relations. The
tactics could be used to solve the first two transfer problems.
The training materials for the constraints group
consisted of a constraints tutorial, constraint summary sheet,
blank recall sheets, and letter string violation worksheet. The
tutorial (5 pages) provided instruction on four letter pattern
constraints: (1) all completed letter strings must be divisible
into six groups of letters, (2) the number of letters in each
similar group must be the same, (3) each letter group must be
derived from either the immediately preceding letter group
or the letter group two back, (4) letter operations must be

repeated. The string violation worksheet provided a series of
completed letter strings in which the participants’ task was to
identify constraint violations.
Test Materials. The test tasks were three letter
extrapolation problems. See Table 1 for each transfer
problem and its solution(s). The first extrapolation problem
had a periodicity of three letters. It was superficially similar
to the exemplar training problems and shared the same deep
pattern structure. This problem could also be solved by
applying either tactics or constraint knowledge. Subjects
were asked to continue the solution to six positions.
The second extrapolation problem also had a periodicity
of three letters. However, the correct continuation was
ambiguous and was dependent on how the subject
interpreted or “parsed” the given sequence. There are two
primary solutions depending on the interpretation of the
given sequence. If the letters are parsed into cross period
relations of forward-1 and backward-1 comparable to
surface similar relations used in the exemplar problems, one
solution type will be derived (see Table 1, solution 1).
However, if the given string is instead parsed as cross period
relations of mirror-flip-alphabet and backward-1 relations as
suggested by a deep analogy or pattern finding tactic 3, a
different solution will be derived. Subjects were asked to
continue the solution to nine positions. In addition, there
were four other possible correct solutions.
The third problem had a periodicity of two letters and
had neither surface nor deep structure similarity to the
exemplar problems. In addition, there was no pattern finding
tactic that directly applied to this problem. However, a
unique solution could be derived by constraint application.
The pattern consists of pairs of letters incrementally
increasing through the alphabet, each pair skipping an
additional letter as the pattern progresses.

Design
A between-subjects design was used with subjects randomly
assigned to one of four training conditions: exemplar
training (n = 31), tactic training (n = 31), constraint training
(n = 33), and no-training (n = 30). Participants were tested
individually. The procedure consisted of a training phase and
a transfer phase.

Procedure
Training procedure for the exemplar group. Participants
were first given general instructions for solving extrapolation
problems. Next they were given three minutes to solve the
first training problem. After three minutes participants
received feedback on each position of their solution. If they
extrapolated any position of the solution incorrectly they
were given another instance of the same problem and three
minutes to solve it. This cycle continued until the problem
was solved correctly or the participant made four attempts to
solve that problem. After the first problem this same
procedure was continued for the remaining three training
problems.
Training procedure for the tactics group. Participants
first read the general tutorial. Next they memorized a
summary sheet of the tactics for three minutes. Then they
were given a simple unrelated distractor task to solve (e.g.,
three arithmetic problems). Participants were then asked to
recall and write down all of the tactics. The experimenter
assessed memory performance for recall of each tactic. If the
subject omitted or incorrectly recalled any of the tactics they
were given the tactic summary sheet to study again for
another two minutes. After the second memorization phase
they were given another distractor task followed by recall.
This cycle was continued until the subject recalled all five
tactics. After correct recall the subjects were asked to explain
each tactic to the experimenter. If the subject gave an
incorrect explanation the experimenter provided the correct
explanation.
Training procedure for the constraints group.
Participants first read the constraints tutorial. Next they
memorized a summary sheet of the four constraints for three
minutes. They were then given an unrelated distractor task to
solve. Participants were then asked to recall the constraints
and were given feedback on their recall performance. If they
omitted or incorrectly recalled any of the constraints they
were given the constraint summary sheet to memorize for
another two minutes. After the second memorization phase
they were given another distractor task followed by a blank
recall sheet. This cycle continued until participants recalled
all four constraints. After correct recall of the constraints
subjects were asked to explain each constraint to the
experimenter. If the subject gave an incorrect explanation the
experimenter provided the correct explanation. Participants
were then given the string violation worksheet.
Training procedure for the no-training group.
Participants in this condition did not receive any training and
served as a comparison condition of baseline performance on
the transfer tasks.

Test procedure for all training groups. Subjects were
seated at the computer and were told that they were to solve
three extrapolation test problems. They were instructed that
the given string of each transfer problem would be presented
on the left side of the computer screen and that there would
be an empty box for each letter position they were to
extrapolate and fill in. Subjects were informed that they
could re-enter new letters in any given position as many
times as they would like. Subjects were told to click the
mouse on the “Finished” field after all solution positions
were filled and they were finished solving the problem. After
the initial instructions participants were presented with each
problem one at a time and given six minutes to solve each
one.

Results and Discussion
Training Performance
Subjects in all three training groups were trained to criterion.
The criterion measure for the exemplar group was solving at
least two of the training problems completely correct. The
criterion measure for the tactical and constraints groups was
complete recall and correct explanation of the tactics and
constraints respectively. Three subjects in the constraints
training condition and one subject in both the exemplar and
tactical training conditions did not pass the criterion. These
subjects were excluded from further analysis leaving thirty
subjects (n = 30) in each training group.
The training criterion provides evidence that each
subject learned the target knowledge during the training
phase (i.e., subjects in the exemplar group could solve
training problems and subjects in the tactical and constraints
group could recall declarative knowledge from memory).
Next, I examine whether these subjects could transfer this
knowledge to the problem solving tasks.

Transfer Performance
The three measures of central interest for the transfer phase
were participants’ accuracy scores and behavioral profiles
across the three transfer problems, as well as the type of
solution used to solve problem 2.
Accuracy Performance. To assess overall transfer
performance participants’ accuracy scores were examined
for each training group. The accuracy score was the
proportion of solution positions correctly extrapolated for a
given transfer problem. The mean accuracy scores and
standard deviations for each training group on the transfer
problems are presented in Table 2.

extrapolated for each transfer problem.

A 4 (training) X 3 (problem type) mixed-analysis of
variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant interaction of
training by problem type, F (6, 232) = 6.46, p < .05. Followup comparisons showed that the interaction was best
explained by the large advantage of the training groups over
the no-training group on transfer problem 1, F (6, 232) =
43.14, p < .05, but not on problems 2 and 3, F (6, 232) = .76,
ns and F (6, 232) = 1.41, ns respectively.
As predicted, all three training groups showed high
accuracy in solving the first two transfer problems. Problem
1 in particular shows that the knowledge generated from
each training condition facilitated transfer resulting in
significantly higher accuracy performance than the notraining group. Although the constraints training group
showed high accuracy on the first two transfer problems they
did not show high accuracy scores on the final problem. One
potential explanation for this lack of predicted transfer is that
solving the first two transfer problems provided participants
with partial exemplar knowledge that interfered with
constraint application (this issue is further discussed in the
conclusion).
Behavioral Profile. In order to assess whether a given
participant used a particular transfer mechanism an ideal
behavioral performance profile was created for each transfer
mechanism. The use of a particular transfer mechanism can
be evidenced by a constellation of scores across a set of
dependent variables, what I term the behavioral signature.
The dependent variables used in this assessment
included the accuracy score, the solution time, the number of
self-corrected errors, and the checking time. The solution
time was the total time in seconds to solve the problem. The
self-corrected error score was the total number of times a
subject re-entered a new letter into a given solution position
that changed a previous response. The checking time was the
amount of time in seconds between a subject’s last
extrapolation response and clicking on the finished button.
This was presumably an indirect measure of error-checking
behavior.
Using this set of dependent measures an ideal behavioral
signature was created for each transfer mechanism (see
Table 3). The qualitative indices (e.g., fast vs. slow) for a
given variable are in comparison to the average no-training
baseline performance.

mechanism.

The ideal behavioral signature for analogical transfer
was a high overall accuracy, a fast solution time on problem
1, and few error correcting behaviors. The ideal behavioral
signature for knowledge compilation was a high overall
accuracy, similar solution times and error correcting
behaviors. The behavioral signature for error-correction was
high accuracy, similar solution times, and a high number of
error correcting behaviors.
Each subject’s performance was examined as to whether
it fit with a particular behavioral signature. For a subject’s
accuracy performance to be classified as high he or she had
to have an overall accuracy score higher than the average
(collapsed across problem) of the no-training group. For a
subject’s solution time to be classified as fast it had to be at
least 1 standard deviation faster than the average solution
time of the no-training group. Subjects were classified as
having high error checking behavior if their performance met
one of two criteria. The participant must have either scored 1
standard deviation above the average no-training group on
both of the error measures (i.e., many self-corrected errors
and long checking time), or have scored 2 standard
deviations above on a single error measure. The number of
subjects classified under each behavioral signature is shown
in Table 4.

Chi-square tests showed that the training groups differed
in the number of subjects classified for a given behavioral
signature, χ2 (6, N = 90) = 43.10, p < .05. Follow-up tests
showed that more subjects trained on exemplars used
analogy than those trained on tactics or constraints, χ2 (2, N
= 30) = 31.02, p < .05, more subjects trained on tactics used
knowledge compilation than those trained on exemplars or
constraints, χ2 (2, N = 30) = 6.49, p < .05, and more subjects
trained constraints used error-correction than those trained
on exemplars or tactics, χ2 (2, N = 30) = 16.94, p < .05.
In summary, the majority of subjects in a particular
transfer condition showed the expected pattern of behavioral
results as predicted by the three theories of transfer. This
provides evidence that these three mechanisms are triggered
under particular learning and transfer task conditions.
Solution Type. In addition to accuracy performance and
behavioral profiles, further support for transfer can be
assessed via the types of solutions participants used on
problem 2. The number of subjects to use a given solution
type is provided in Table 5.

Chi-square tests showed that the training groups
significantly differed in the number of subjects to use a
particular solution type, χ2 (6, N = 77) = 41.68, p < .05. Of
particular interest is that more exemplar training subjects
used solution 1 than those given other forms of training, χ2
(3, N = 77) = 20.80, p < .05, and that more tactics training
subjects used solution 2 than subjects from the other groups,
χ2 (3, N = 77) = 29.70, p < .05.
In sum, these results provide further evidence that
participants used training knowledge to solve the transfer
problems. Subjects given exemplar training showed a
preference for the surface similar solution and the tactics
group showed a preference for the tactics relevant solution.

Conclusion
The results from this study provide support for the
hypothesis that there are multiple mechanisms of transfer
that are distinct and identifiable. Subjects in three separate
transfer scenarios exhibited behavioral patterns of
performance consistent with those predicted by three theories
of knowledge transfer.
Several review articles have pointed out that the transfer
literature exhibits a mixture of both positive and negative
results (Bransford & Shwartz, 1999; Salomon & Perkins,
1989). While some studies have failed to find large transfer
effects where we intuitively expect them, others have found
transfer effects under particular types of study and test
conditions. The complexity of the empirical results suggests
that transfer is a heterogeneous phenomenon. Greater clarity
might result if we assume that different transfer processes
are triggered in different types of transfer scenarios. Results
from the current study suggest that to understand transfer one
must take a multifaceted approach and examine several
interrelated aspects of the transfer scenario, not just one or
two variables from a single theoretical perspective. Progress
towards a general theory of transfer requires the synthesis
and integration across current lines of research.
Future work should examine the interaction of these
transfer mechanisms and investigate whether people are
capable of adaptively shifting between mechanisms
depending on their prior knowledge and the processing
demands of the transfer task.
