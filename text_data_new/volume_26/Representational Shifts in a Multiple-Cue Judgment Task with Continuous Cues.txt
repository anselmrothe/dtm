Abstract
Research on multiple cue judgment with continuous cues
and a continuous criterion has been dominated by statistical modeling of the cue utilization with linear multiple
regression. In this study we apply two cognitive process
models to investigate the relative contributions of explicit
abstraction of the cue-criterion relations and memory for
concrete exemplars in a multiple-cue judgment task. The
task was an extension of a previous task with binary cues
(P. Juslin, H. Olsson., A-C. Olsson, 2003) and involved
multiple continuous cues that either combined by addition or multiplication. As predicted by the process model
∑ (P. Juslin, L. Karlsson, & H. Olsson, manuscript) explicit abstraction of cue-criterion relations were induced
in the additive task, while exemplar memory was induced
in the multiplicative task.

Introduction
Multiple-cue judgment research has traditionally been
concerned with statistical modeling of judgment data.
Rather exquisite regression models have been developed that describe multiple-cue judgment as a) well
fitted by a linear additive model; b) only taking a few
cues into account; c) hard to report on subjectively; d)
characterized by cue weightings that differ greatly between individuals; and e) plagued by considerable inconsistency in the weighting of the cues (see Brehmer,
1994; Cooksey, 1996; Hammond & Stewart, 2001).
In the light of the cognitive revolution it might seem
puzzling that this field of research has not benefited
from the growth of cognitive modeling as a means to
track the underlying cognitive representation and process of judgment, a growth seen in related fields like
categorization learning (but see for example Bott &
Heit, 2004; Busemeyer, Byun, DeLosh, & McDaniel,
1997; or DeLosh, Busemeyer & McDaniel, 1997, single-cue learning). Categorization – which is in many
ways similar to multiple-cue judgment (see Juslin,
Olsson, & Olsson, 2003) – has invited extensive investigation of the cognitive representations and processes
that underlie behavior. A plethora of models, ranging
from an emphasis on how abstract rules or prototypes
648

guide category decisions to a domination of memory
for category exemplars are thus available in cognitive
science today. In this study we apply the methods of
cognitive modeling to a typical multiple-cue judgment
task. By connecting research on cognitive science to
judgment and decision making research, we can gain an
understanding of what cognitive representations and
processes guide the judgments, and how this is manifested in the results of the traditional statistical modeling (e.g., Cooksey, 1996).
Arguably, it is not mere coincidence that linear, additive models fit multiple cue judgment data well and that
categorization is often well captured by exemplar models that entail a linear additive combination of retrieved
exemplars (Juslin, Karlsson, & Olsson, manuscript).
Imagine how you sequentially consider and weigh the
pros and cons of different aspects of a car before you
purchase it (its looks, reliability, etc). You may weigh
them differently but positive qualities add to and negative qualities subtract from your overall opinion. Likewise, you may sequentially consider exemplars of similar cars that you are aware of: similar cars (e.g., same
model) that have worked properly add to the appeal of
the car and cars that that have been frustrating subtract
from it.
We have proposed a general process model, ∑, that
captures the essentials of multiple-cue judgment, both
when it is driven by consideration of cue-criterion relations and exemplar retrieval (Juslin et al., manuscript).
The assumptions in ∑ are that our controlled and explicit thought processes have an architectural constraint
enhancing sequential, real-time consideration of multiple pieces of evidence (cues or exemplars). The process
involves successive adjustment of an estimate, a process structurally compatible with linear, additive cue
integration (Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979)
and exemplar models (Nosofsky & Johansen, 2000).
The key assumption is that, in effect, all integration
of information involves addition (or subtraction). This
hypothesis suggests that explicit and controlled thought
processes are apt at performing cue-integration only in

tasks where the cue-criterion relations in the task indeed
combine by addition. By contrast, a task that involves
non-linear or multiplicative cue combination requires
capitalization on exemplar memory (Medin & Schaffer,
1978; Nosofsky & Johansen, 2000). Exemplar memory
involves no strong computational commitments to particular task structures. With a division of labor between
distinct representations we are better equipped to adapt
to different task structures. We propose that the judgment process adapts to specific task environments and
predict that in a multiple-cue judgment task with continuous cues we can induce a shift between qualitatively distinct processes by manipulating the structural
properties of the environment: additive cue combination should promote cue abstraction and multiplicative
cue combination should promote exemplar memory.

Judgment Task and Cognitive Models
The judgment task involves judgment of a continuous
criterion based on continuous cues. The task concerns
judgments of the effectiveness of different species of
herbs as medical treatments to a lethal virus. The effectiveness is measured as the maximal amount of a
chemical substance (mg) that can be extracted from the
species. The species have four continuous dimensions
(C1, C2, C3, C4), and each cue dimension can take a
value between 0 and 10. The judgment of effectiveness
requires inference from these dimensions, which are
presented as verbal statements (e.g., weeks of bloom
per year, geographic place of growth).
The tasks involve two manipulations. First, there is
one condition in which all cues are related to the criteria
positively and linearly, and one condition in which two
cues are positively and two cues are negatively linearly
related to the criterion. This manipulation makes the
task a matter of function learning. Second, there is a
manipulation of whether the effects of the four cues on
the criterion combine by addition or multiplication.
In the additive condition the criterion is a linear, additive function of the continuous cues:
(1)
c = 500 + 4 ⋅ C1 + 3 ⋅ C 2 + 2 ⋅ C 3 + 1 ⋅ C 4 + ε .
C1 is the most important cue with coefficient 4 (i.e., a
relative weight .4), C2 is the second to most important
with coefficient 3, and so forth. The cues are uncorrelated. ε is a normally and independently distributed
random error with a standard deviation that produces a
multiple correlation R between cues and criterion of .9
(i.e., defining the ecological validity of the cues).
In the multiplicative condition the criterion c is a
multiplicative function of the four cues:
c = 509.05 + 0.54545 ⋅ e ( C1⋅4+C2 ⋅3+C3⋅2+C4 ⋅1) / 18 + ε , (2)
with the same coefficients as in the additive task (Eq.
1). The effectiveness varies between 500 and 600 mg of
chemical substance in the additive task and 509 to 650
mg in the multiplicative task. However, the training
ranges are hold equal for the two conditions. The range
of cue values observed in the two tasks is therefore the
649

same. Moreover, the criterion in the multiplicative
condition is an exponential function of the criterion
presented in the additive condition.
We use two structural models to derive predictions, a
cue-abstraction (CAM) and an exemplar model (EBM).
∑ implies that in the additive task CAM should be the
correct structural description of the process, whereas in
the multiplicative condition EBM should be the appropriate description1. The CAM assumes that participants
abstract explicit cue-criterion relations in training that
are mentally integrated at the time of judgment. When
presented with a probe the participants retrieve rules
connecting cues to criterion (e.g., “More weeks in
bloom gives more effectiveness”). The rules specify the
sign and importance of each cue with a cue weight. For
example, after training the rule for C1 may specify that
high C1 goes with an increase in the criterion.
The CAM implies that participants compute an estimate of the criterion c based on sequential consideration of cues. For each cue, the estimate of c is adjusted
according to the cue weight ω iA (i=1…4). The final
estimate ĉCA is a linear additive function of the cues Ci,
4

cˆCA = k + ∑ ω iA ⋅ Ci ,

(3)

i =1

where k = 500 + .5 ⋅ (100 − 10 ⋅ ∑ ω iA ) . If ω1 A =4, ω 2 A =3,
ω 3 A =2, and ω 4 A =1, Eq’s 1 and 3 are identical and the
model produce perfect judgments. The intercept k constrains the function relating judgments to criteria to be
regressive around the midpoint (550) of the interval
[500, 600] (Juslin et al., manuscript).
Although ruled out by the predictions of ∑, we also
consider the possibility that participants have correctly
abstracted the multiplicative cue-criterion relations by
fitting a multiplicative cue-abstraction model to the
4
data:
( ∑ ωiM ⋅Ci ) / 18
(4)
c = 509.05 + 0.54545 ⋅ e i =1
where ω1M are the best fitting subjective cue weights in
the multiplicative cue abstraction model.
EBM is commonly applied to classification, but here
we apply it to a continuous criterion. EBM implies that
participants make judgments by retrieving similar exemplars (herb species) from memory. When the exemplar model is applied to judgments of a continuous
criterion variable, the estimate ĉ E of the criterion c is a
weighted average of the criteria cj stored for the J exemplars, where the similarities S(p,xj) are the weights:

∑ is a model of the real-time process of judgment that becomes structurally identical with a CAM when the representations fed to the process are abstracted cues and structurally
identical to an EBM when the process is fed by exemplars.
The structural description refers to the relationships between
stimulus features and the response (Juslin et al., manuscript).

In the experiment, herb species with a criterion above
590 and below 510 are not included in the training
phase. This makes it possible to distinguish between the
models as they provide different predictions (Figure 1).
In the training phase, all exemplars have effectiveness
between 510 and 590. If participants have estimated the
correct cue weight for each cue they should compute
the most extreme judgments for the extreme exemplars
that are left out in the training phase. More specifically,
whenever participants have correctly identified the sign
of each cue (i.e., whether it increases or decreases the
criterion) they should make more extreme judgments
for the exemplars with all cues at their maximum and
the exemplars with all cues at their minimum, as illustrated on the left-side of Figure 1. By contrast, the exemplar model computes a weighted average of the
criteria between 510 and 590 stored with the exemplars
and this can never produce a value outside of this observed range (Erickson & Krusckhe, 1998; but see
DeLosh et al., 1997). Moreover, because of the nonlinear similarity function of the GCM the most extreme
judgments tend to be made for the second to most extreme exemplars. For these exemplars the judgment is
dominated by retrieval of the identical stored exemplars
and these identical exemplars are the most extreme that
were encountered in the training phase. These predictions are illustrated on the right side of Figure 1.
For new exemplars in the mid range of the criterion
cue abstraction suggests no systematic difference between new exemplars and old exemplars matched on
the criterion: the cognitive process is the same regardless of whether a specific exemplar has been encoun-

reflects overall discriminability in the psychological

but we changed that to avoid confusion with the criterion c). Attentional weights vary between 0 and 1 and
are constrained to sum to 1. The similarity S(p,xj) between a probe p and an exemplar j is assumed to be a

version of the context model (Medin & Schaffer, 1978).

transforming the distance between them. The distance

The Experiment
In the experiment we manipulated whether participants
were confronted with a task that involved additive or
multiplicative cue combination. For the reasons outlined in the introduction, we predicted that the additive
task (Eq.1) should promote explicit cue abstraction with
additive cue integration (Eq. 3). A multiplicative task
(Eq. 2) should cause a shift to a qualitatively different
process, that is, to exemplar memory (Eq. 5).
The sign of the linear relations between cues and criterion was also manipulated. For half of the participants
all four cues were positively related to the criterion and
for half of the participants two cues were positively and
two cues were negatively related to the criterion. In line
with the assumptions of ∑, we predict that in an additive task, whether cue directions are negative or positive should not affect the ability to perform cue abstraction. In a multiplicative task, both with homogeneous

Materials and Procedure
The experiment consisted of a training phase and a test
phase. In the training phase, the participant learned to
judge the effectiveness of each species of the herb by
means of outcome feedback. The effectiveness was
measured as the amount (mg) of the fictitious chemical
substance Ranulin. In the training phase, the effectiveness varied between 510 and 590 mg. The species were
shown as four written propositions on a computer
screen. At each trial in the training phase, the participant was to answer the question “How many milligrams
of Ranulin does this specie contain?”. After giving a
response they received the correct answer: “This specie
contain 540 milligrams of Ranulin”. The four dimensions were: number of weeks in bloom, the optimal
amount of iron in the ground, the degrees of latitude
where it does well, and the amount of water it emits per
leaf area. Each dimension varied “pseudocontinuously” in 11 equidistant steps that ranged between 0 and 10, yielding a total of 114 different exemplars. In the training phase, a random sample of 300
exemplars was drawn from this distribution and shown
to the participant. A pause of two minutes was given to
the participant after the first 150 trials.
In the test phase, participants were to judge the effectiveness of the species of the herbs but now without
outcome feed-back. In the test phase, new exemplars
were included. The test phase consisted of 44 judgments of a) 20 randomly chosen old exemplars shown
in training, b) 20 randomly chosen new exemplars,
drawn from the training distribution and c) 4 extreme
exemplars, with criterion values outside the training
range (eg. the exemplars with cue values [0,0,0,0] and
[10,10,10,10])
In the condition with heterogeneous cue directions,
for half of the participants, negative sign was assigned
to the cues with objective weight 4 and 2, and for half
of the participants to the cues with weights 3 and 1.

Dependent Measures
The measure of performance is Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of judgment (i.e., between judgment and
criterion). Measures of model fit are the coefficient of
determination (r2) and Root Mean Square Deviation
(RMSD) between predictions and data from the test
phase.

In the multiplicative homogeneous condition the
judgments clearly deviate both from the identity line

the criteria in the training range there is evidence for an
inability to extrapolate. The judgments are not extrapolated beyond the range of training.
In the additive heterogeneous condition (Figure 2C)
the judgments are still close to the optimal judgment

effects. In the multiplicative heterogeneous condition
(Panel D) the mean judgments are a positive function of

Quantitative model predictions were obtained by fitting the models in the introduction (Eq. 3, 4 & 5) to the
latter half of the training phase with Mean Square Error

the cue-abstraction model. In the multiplicative homogeneous condition the reverse is true, namely that the
exemplar model produces the best explanation. In the
additive heterogeneous condition the proportion of
participants explained by the cue abstraction model
decreases. In the multiplicative heterogeneous condition, as hypothesized the exemplar-based model continues to provide the best explanation of data for most of
the participants. The multiplicative cue-abstraction
model describes some of the participants in both the

tasks.

The models were thus fitted to data from the training
phase and applied with these parameters to the wider
range of herb species in the test phase. This implies
cross-validation for exemplars presented in training and
genuine predictions for new exemplars. To capture
individual differences, the models were applied to individual data. Table 2 shows the mean fit for the three
models. In the additive condition cue abstraction is the
overall dominant model, regardless of the cue directions. In the multiplicative condition exemplar memory
describes the data best with regard to r2 and the multiplicative cue-abstraction model yields a smaller mean
RMSD. The rather low fit of all three models in the
heterogeneous conditions may be explained by larger
noise in these data since this task is presumably more
difficult than the homogeneous task. Figure 3 shows the
proportion of participants best accounted for by each
model in terms of RMSD. In the additive homogeneous

The results reported in this paper support the assumptions made by ∑ that multiple-cue judgment processes
conceal an effective division of labor between qualitatively distinct cognitive processes (Juslin et al., manuscript). Cognitive modeling supports the hypothesis that
in a multiple-cue judgment task where the cues combine by addition, ∑ is fed with representations in form
of abstracted knowledge of the relations between cues
and criterion. On the other hand, in an environment
where the cues relate to the criteria by a multiplicative
function we seem to be equipped with no means to
explicitly abstract the underlying structure. In such
tasks, people seem to resort to the back-up process of
exemplar-memory.
The fact that exemplar-memory plays part also in
additive tasks is not a coincidence, since both processes
allows accurate performance in training. That the multiplicative cue-abstraction model provide an explanation
for some of the participants in the multiplicative task is
more surprising. This is probably an effect both of large
noise in data and of its high correlations to the exem-

plar model. Figure 2 B & C yields no evidence for
successful extrapolation beyond the range of training.
The bad performance in the multiplicative heterogeneous condition, together with the low fit of the models
makes it unfair to draw conclusions regarding what
cognitive process that has dominated the judgments in
this condition. What makes this task difficult to learn?
A tentative hypothesis would be that in training there is
a bias towards the abstraction of specific rules (eg. rule
bias; see for example Ashby et al., 1998; Juslin et al.,
2003; manuscript). Presumably, a period of extensive
hypothesis testing is therefore taking place at beginning
of training. However, the multiplicative heterogeneous
task may be inductive of more extensive hypothesistesting procedures. The back-up of exemplar memory is
thus postponed, and thereby learning may be impaired.
An interesting approach to the interpretation of the
data would be to consider how an exemplar-model
augmented with linear extrapolation would account for
the results (see EXAM; DeLosh et al., 1997; Busemeyer
et al., 1997, for results on single-cue learning). EXAM
suggests that, although learning has been in the form of
exemplar-memory, abstraction of cue-criterion relations
is possible at test. When encountered with a new exemplar at test, familiar exemplars and their stored criterion
are retrieved from memory. An extrapolated judgment
for the new exemplar is then made possible through
linear regression based on the old exemplars. How this
model explains the data reported in this paper remains
to be tested, although a first qualitative evaluation of
the data in Figure 2 can be made. Given the data in the
additive condition, EXAM is likely to produce the same
fit as the cue-abstraction model. In the multiplicative
condition EXAM would predict no difference between
the regression made on old exemplars and the regression made on new exemplars. This difference is however apparent in the data in Figure 2 (Panel B & C) and
thus suggests the refutation of EXAM in favor of EBM.
The main interpretation to be drawn from the results
reported in this paper is that the human judge, under the
constraints imposed by ∑, adapt to different task structures by means of representational shifts. This highlights how the task is a powerful predictor of cognitive
process in human multiple-cue judgment.
