A bstract
The effectoftypicality ofcategory exem plars on nam ing
perform ance w as investigated using a single subject
experim entaldesign across participants and behaviors in
four patients w ith fluentaphasia.Participants received a
sem antic feature treatm ent to im prove nam ing of either
typical or atypical exam ples, w hile generalization w as
tested on the untrained exam ples of the category. The
order of typicality and category trained w as
counterbalanced across the participants. Results
indicated that patients trained on nam ing of atypical
exam ples dem onstrated generalization to nam ing of
interm ediate and typical exam ples. Patients trained on
typical exam ples dem onstrated no generalization to
nam ing of interm ediate or atypical exam ples.
Im plications for m odels of typicality and rehabilitation
ofaphasia are discussed.

Introduction
A phasia is a language disorder that results
from dam age (such as stroke orhead traum a)usually to
the left hem isphere of the brain. N am ing difficulty is
the m ost com m on form of language deficit noted in
individuals with aphasia.O ne widely accepted m odelof
nam ing (D ell, 1986; Stem berger, 1985) suggests that
activation of a word during nam ing involves two
closely interacting levels, activation of the sem antic
representation as wellas activation of the phonological
form of the target word.N am ing deficits can therefore
arise from difficulty in activation at either of the two
levels. Patients with nam ing deficits arising from an
im pairm entin activating sem antic representations often
present with im pairm ents in accessing appropriate
sem antic fields within categories (G oodglass & Baker,
1976).
N um erous studies on norm al individuals have
found typical exam ples of a category to be accessed
faster and m ore accurately than atypical exam ples, an
effect labeled the typicality effect (Rips, Shoben, &

Sm ith,1973;Rosch,1975).Evidence for the typicality
effect exists through typicality ratings (Rosch, 1975),
response tim es on category verification tasks
(Larochelle & Pineu, 1994), and category production
frequency (Rosch, 1975). Little evidence, however,
exists regarding representation of typicality in
individuals with aphasia, although som e investigations
have noted deficits (G rober et al., 1980; G rossm an,
1981). The interpretation of these deficits with
reference to theoretical m odels of typicality however
has notbeen addressed.
In a connectionist account of relearning in
neuralnetworks,itwas found thata lesioned com puter
network retrained on atypical exam ples resulted in
im provem ents on typical item s as well (Plaut, 1996).
Training typical item s, however, only im proved the
perform ance of those item s while perform ance of
atypical words deteriorated during treatm ent. W hile
Plaut’s findings have notyetbeen tested in individuals
with aphasia,the prospectofsuch generalization effects
is especially significant for treatm ent of nam ing
deficits,since m ostnam ing treatm ents have found little
generalization to untrained item s (M cN eil et al.,1997;
Pring etal.,1993).
The present experim ent aim ed to investigate
the effects of exem plar typicality on nam ing
perform ance in individuals with aphasia. Specifically,
the purpose of the experim entwas to train nam ing of a
set of typical or atypical exam ples of a superordinate
category, and exam ine generalization to untrained
exam ples of the category.The present experim ent was
m otivated by prototypical/ fam ily resem blance m odels
of typicality (H am pton,1979; Rosch & M ervis,1975).
A ccording to these m odels, on a m ultidim ensional
scaling of a category (e.g.,bird) based on sim ilarity of
item s,typicalexam ples (e.g.,robin,sparrow) are found
to have m ore features sim ilar am ongst them and with
the category prototype, and therefore are represented
closer to the center of the sem antic space.In contrast,

atypical item s (e.g., penguin, ostrich) have fewer
features that are sim ilar am ongst them and the
prototype, and are at the periphery of this sem antic
space. W e hypothesized that training aphasic
individuals to produce atypical exam ples from a
category would result in generalization to m ore typical
exam ples of the category. If indeed atypical exam ples
are atthe periphery of the category,then strengthening
access to these exam ples by em phasizing the variation
of sem antic features across the category would
strengthen the overall sem antic category. Conversely,
typical exam ples were hypothesized to represent little
or no variation within the category.Therefore,training
typical exam ples was predicted to im prove only item s
at the center of the category, with no im provem ents
expected foratypicalexam ples.

M ethods
Participants
Four individuals,ranging in age from 63-75 years,and
presenting with aphasia resulting from
a
cebrebrovascular accident to the left hem isphere were
selected for the experim ent.A llfour patients presented
with fluent aphasia, characterized by fluent
circum locutory speech, m ild auditory com prehension
deficits and severe nam ing difficulties. Based on
standardized language testing, the locus of nam ing
deficitwas attributable to im pairm ents in accessing the
sem antic representation of the target, and/or in
accessing its phonologicalform .

Stim uli
N orm s for typicality of category exem plars were
developed prior to initiation of the experim ent. O ne
group of 20 norm al young and elderly subjects
constructed as m any exam ples as possible for ten
categories,while anothergroup of20 norm alyoung and
elderly subjects rated the typicality of these exam ples
on a 7-point scale. Exam ples for each category were
then divided into three groups,typical,interm ediate and
atypical, based on their average z scores. Based on
several selection criteria, which included frequency,
distinctiveness, num ber of syllables, unam biguity
regarding category m em bership, two categories (birds
and vegetables) with 24 exam ples each were selected
for treatm ent.Each setof 24 item s included a subsetof
eight typical and eight atypical item s. The rem aining
eightin each setwere determ ined to be interm ediate in
term s of typicality. For each of the selected exam ples,
corresponding color photos printed on 4 x 6 inch cards
were selected. In addition to the experim ental photos,
stim uli from three different superordinate categories
(fruit,anim al and m usical instrum ent) were selected to
serve as distracters fortreatm ent.

O nce the two categories and their24 exam ples
were selected,sem antic features for each category were
developed. For each category, a m inim um of 20
features belonging to the category that were either
physical, functional, characteristic or contextual
attributes were selected.A dditionally,a m inim um of20
distracter features to be used during the yes/no question
tasks (see treatm ent), using the sam e four attribute
types not belonging to the target category were
developed.A t least 10 features that were applicable to
all exam ples in the category were selected (e.g., bird:
has a beak, lays eggs), while obscure features (e.g.,
asian food for vegetable),and features thatwere salient
only for a single exam ple (e.g., hoots for owl, drills
holes for wood pecker) were elim inated. G enerally,
features that were applicable to two or m ore item s in
the category were selected. D istracter features
belonging to the categories sport, transportation,
anim al, insect,flower and weapon were selected using
the sam e criteria as the targetcategory features.

D esign
A single subject experim ental design with m ultiple
baselines across behaviors and participants (Connell&
Thom pson, 1986) was em ployed. In such an
experim entaldesign,effects oftreatm entare assessed at
regular intervals for each patient separately. In the
presentstudy,as treatm entwas extended to atypicalor
typical m em bers of a superordinate category,
generalization to the rem aining exam ples was
exam ined. The em ergent nam ing patterns provided
inform ation regarding the re-organization and
representation ofsem antic categories.
Prior to application of treatm ent, during the
baseline phase, nam ing of all 48 exam ples of two
categories (N = 24) was tested. Picture nam ing was
then trained using selected exam ples of one
superordinate category,with the orderofcategories and
exem plartypicality counterbalanced across participants.
D uring treatm ent, nam ing of all 24 exam ples in the
category were assessed every second treatm entsession.
These nam ing probes constituted the dependentvariable
in the study and nam ing accuracy over tim e was
assessed.See table 1 for order of treatm entfor the four
patients.
Criteria for acquisition of nam ing of trained
item s was 7/8 item s nam ed correctly on two
consecutive nam ing probes. G eneralization to nam ing
of untrained exam ples was considered to have occurred
when a 40% change over baseline levels was noted for
untrained exam ples. If generalization to nam ing of
untrained item s was observed,treatm entwas shifted to
the second category. If generalization to nam ing of
untrained item s was notobserved,treatm entwas shifted
to the next group (i.e., interm ediate) within the sam e
category.

Treatm ent
For each participant, one subset of item s within a
category (typical,interm ediate or atypical) was trained
at a tim e. In each treatm ent session, participants
practiced the following steps for each of the eight
exam ples of a subset:a) nam ing the picture,2) sorting
pictures of the target category (N =24) with three
distracter categories (N =36), 3) identifying 6 sem antic
attributes applicable to the targetexam ple from a setof
35 features of the superordinate category,4) answering
15 yes/no questions regarding the presence or absence
of a set of sem antic features about the target exam ple.
D istracters on this task included sem antic features from
the target category not applicable to the target, and
features from unrelated superordinate categories.

D iscussion
The present experim ent dem onstrates that training
atypical exam ples of a category and their sem antic
features results in generalization to nam ing of
interm ediate and typicalexam ples of the category.This
finding was observed in Participants 2 and 4 across two
categories even when the order of categories was
counterbalanced across the two participants. Training
typical exam ples and their sem antic features,however,
did not result in generalization to the interm ediate and
atypicalexam ples,as observed in Participant1 and 3.
These findings suggest that because atypical
exam ples are dissim ilar to one another and to the
category prototype,these exam ples collectively convey

m ore inform ation in term s of sem antic features about
the variation thatcan occur within the category than do
typical exam ples. H eightening access to featural
inform ation relevant to sem antic categories, therefore
facilitate access to m ore typicalitem s within a category.
W hile ithas been dem onstrated thatgreatercoverage of
a category’s features can lead to stronger inductive
generalizations (Slom an, 1993), current m odels of
typicality do notexplain the treatm enteffects observed
in the presentexperim ent.For instance,findings of the
present experim ent cannot be explained by the twostage feature com parison m odel (Sm ith, Shoben, &
Rips, 1974), since this m odel only explains category
m em bership and notexem plaraccess.
Sim ilarly, prototype/fam ily
resem blance
m odels (H am pton, 1979; Rosch & M ervis, 1975)
suggest that categories are represented by a set of
weighted sem antic features as a function of typicality,
but do not explicitly state the relation between these
sum m ary feature representations and the phonological
representations of specific exam ples. M oreover,
prototype m odels do not specify how the various
exam ples in a category are connected to each other,an
elem ent crucial to the explanation of the present
experim ent.
Exem plar m odels (e.g., H eit & Barsalou,
1996) com e closest to explaining the results of the
present experim ent in that typical and atypical
exam ples are represented as specific instances in the
category that have been previously encountered.
Therefore, it can be assum ed that these specific
representations are associated with their phonological
representations.H owever,ifexam ples ofa category are
represented as abstractions of specific instances, the
exem plar m odels do notexplain why training sem antic
features of atypical exam ples would result in
im provem ents in nam ing oftypicalexam ples.
In sum m ary, although all m odels of typicality
explain possible differences in the representation of
typical and atypicalexam ples,they do notpredictwhy
training sem antic features of atypical exam ples would
im prove phonological access of not just atypical
exam ples but of interm ediate and typical exam ples as
well. M ore im portantly, these m odels do not predict
why training sem antic features of typical exam ples
would result in no im provem ent in the phonological
access of interm ediate and atypical exam ples. Even
Plaut’s connectionist m odel (1996), which m otivates
the presentexperim ent,does notexplain the m echanism
involved in accessing im proved phonological form s.
This m odel describes a reading via m eaning task with
fourlayers,orthographic inputlayer,interm ediate layer,
a sem antic layer and clean up layer. To generate
sem antic features, the prototype represents a set of
sem antic features (or binary values) with a high
probability of becom ing active.Typicalexam ples share

m ostof their features with the prototype,while atypical
exam ples share few features with the prototype.
Therefore, while this m odel provides an explicit
account on the extent of difference between typical,
atypicalexam ples and the prototype,the nature ofthese
features (whether defining or characteristic), and the
nature of the exam ples (whether sum m ary
representations orspecific instances)are also unclear.
A ny explanation for the present experim ent
should therefore account for the following: (a) effects
of treatm ent on im provem ents in sem antic feature
representation, (b) influence of strengthened sem antic
representations on access to phonological form s, (c)
selective strengthening of connections between atypical
and typical phonological representations (and not the
other way around). A com bination of interactive
activation m odels (D ell, 1986; Stem berger, 1985) and
prototype m odels of typicality provide such an
explanation. Two levels of representation are
hypothesized, sem antic and phonological, and the
connections between the sem antic and phonological
levels are bi-directional and excitatory while
connections within each levelare inhibitory.W ithin the
sem antic level,each exam ple of a category (e.g.,bird)
is a sum m ary representation of weighted sem antic
features, which interfaces with the lexical
representation of the exam ple. Item s that are typical
exertgreater lateralinhibition on otherexam ples within
the category, due to their sim ilarity with the category
prototype.Less typicalitem s exertless lateralinhibition
on corresponding exam ples.This is because less typical
item s are dissim ilar from the category prototype and
illustrate the variation of sem antic features that can
exist (e.g., cannot fly, lives near water). Training
sem antic features ofatypicalexam ples strengthens their
corresponding lexical representation and by the nature
of the weak lateral inhibition, strengthens the
representations of interm ediate and typicalexam ples as
well.These strengthened sem antic representations exert
an excitatory influence on their corresponding
phonological representations,which are raised above a
resting threshold level. It is hypothesized that item s
directly trained receive a greater unit of activation to
cross the resting threshold than untrained item s.
Training typical exam ples on the other hand,
only strengthens the sem antic representations of the
typical exam ples, and since these features convey no
inform ation about the variation of sem antic features
that can occur in the category, they have no influence
on the sem antic representations of interm ediate and
atypical exam ples. Therefore, the lateral inhibition
exerted by the sem antic representations of typical
exam ples on interm ediate and atypical exam ples does
notreduce following treatm ent.Consequently,only the
strengthened typical representations can successfully
raise their corresponding phonological representations

above the resting threshold. The unchanged sem antic
representations for interm ediate and atypicalexam ples,
can exertno excitatory influence on theircorresponding
phonological representations, and therefore have to be
trained directly in treatm ent to be nam ed successfully.
These hypotheses are currently being tested using a
connectionistnetwork sim ulation.
Finally,results of the presentexperim enthave
significant im plications for rehabilitation in aphasia.
These results, although counter-intuitive to traditional
treatm ent approaches, suggest that training nam ing of
atypical exam ples is a m ore efficient m ethod of
im proving nam ing item s within a category than training
typical item s. Interestingly, training m ore com plex
item s which encom pass variables relevant to sim pler
item s have been dem onstrated in other language
dom ains. Training com plex syntactic structures results
in generalization to sim pler ones in agram m atic aphasic
patients (Thom pson, Ballard & Shapiro, 1998;
Thom pson et al., 1997) and training com plex
phonological form s results in im provem ents to sim pler
form s in children with phonological deficits (G eirut et
al., 1996, 1999). These results also provide im portant
insights into the m echanism s of relearning in patients
with brain dam age. In these individuals, it is assum ed
that language organization is fractionated following
brain dam age.The goaloflanguage treatm entis then to
com pensate and m axim ize the use of spared functions.
The results of the present experim ent suggest that
relearning of category structure and corresponding
phonological representations can be re-established in a
m ore efficientway than previously thought.
