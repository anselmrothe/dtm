Abstract
In a lexical decision task (LDT), Pexman, Lupker, and Jared
(2001) reported longer response times for homophones (e.g.,
MAID-MADE) than for non-homophones (e.g., MESS) and
attributed these effects to orthographic competition created by
feedback activation from phonology. The focus of the present
research was the grain-size of the orthographic units activated
by feedback from phonology. We created 9 categories of
homophones based on the sublexical, orthographic overlap
between members of homophone pairs. We also manipulated
the type of foils presented in LDT (consonant strings,
pseudowords, pseudohomophones) to create conditions
involving less vs. more extensive processing. Homophone
effect sizes varied by category; effects were largest when
spellings of both onsets and bodies differed within the
homophone pairs (e.g., KERNEL-COLONEL) and when
members of the homophone pairs differed by vowel
graphemes (e.g., BRAKE-BREAK). These results suggest
that several specific grain-sizes of orthographic representation
are activated by feedback phonology.

Feedback activation is assumed to operate between all
sets of units in the word recognition system. The focus of
the present research, however, was feedback activation from
phonology to orthography. Taft and van Graan (1998; see
also Taft, 1991) argued for bi-directional activation between
orthography and phonology by what they termed
“orthography-phonology-orthography rebound”. The model
of word recognition they described was similar to models
proposed by Grainger and Ferrand (1994), Plaut et al.
(1996), and Van Orden and Goldinger (1994). A version of
this model is illustrated in Figure 1. This is a connectionist
model with sets of processing units representing
orthographic, phonological, and semantic information.
Importantly, the orthographic and phonological components
of the model (but not the semantic component) are
“composed of a hierarchy of units ranging from graphemes
(e.g., C, A, and T) and phonemes (e.g., /k/, /æ/, and /t/) up to
whole words. Activation passes up this hierarchy as well as
between O and P units at the same level.” (p. 206).

Introduction
In a number of recent articles in the word recognition
literature, the notion of feedback activation has been
invoked to explain particular findings (e.g., Hino & Lupker,
1996; Pecher, in press; Pexman & Lupker, 1999; Pexman,
Lupker, & Jared, 2001; Stone, Vanhoy, & Van Orden, 1997;
Taft & van Graan, 1998; Ziegler, Montant, & Jacobs, 1997).
In a fully interactive model of word recognition (e.g., the
PDP model of Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson,
1996) activation between sets of units can be bi-directional.
For instance, in a lexical decision task, when a target word
is presented, there is initial activation of an orthographic
representation for the target, and then very quickly there is
also activation of semantic and phonological representations
for that word. Those semantic and phonological
representations then re-activate, via feedback connections,
the orthographic representation. This bi-directional flow of
activation can help the system settle on a representation for
the target word. The purpose of the present research was to
address an unresolved issue regarding feedback activation:
What is the nature (grain-size) of the orthographic units that
are activated by feedback from phonology?

Figure 1: As depicted in Taft & van Graan (1998), a model
of word recognition with sets of units representing
orthography (O), phonology (P), and semantics (S).
Taft and van Graan (1998) argued that, when processing
printed words, there is automatic activation of the
phonological component of the model. Certainly, there has
been controversy about the role that phonology plays in

visual word recognition (e.g., Davelaar, Coltheart, Besner &
Jonasson, 1978; Jared & Seidenberg, 1991; Pugh, Rexer, &
Katz, 1994, etc.). While Taft and van Graan found evidence
that phonology did not mediate access to word meaning,
they concluded that there was evidence for activation of
phonology. That evidence came from studies involving
homophone stimuli (e.g., MAID-MADE) (e.g., Jared &
Seidenberg, 1991; Van Orden, 1987, etc.).
In several studies, researchers have investigated whether
homophones create confusion when presented without
context, in a lexical decision task (LDT) (e.g., M. Coltheart,
Davelaar, Johnasson, & Besner, 1977; Rubenstein, Lewis,
and Rubenstein, 1971). Recently, Pexman et al., (2001)
reported longer decision latencies for homophones than for
nonhomophonic control words in LDT, particularly for low
frequency homophones with higher frequency homophone
mates. Those homophone effects were larger with
pseudohomophone foils than with pseudoword foils.
Pexman et al. concluded that homophone effects in LDT
were robust, and argued for automatic activation of
phonology in visual word recognition.
Pexman et al. (2001) offered an account of homophone
effects in LDT that was similar in many ways to the notion
of orthography-phonology-orthography rebound (Taft & van
Graan, 1998). Pexman et al.’s account was based on the
concept of feedback phonology. The notion that feedback
activation from phonology to orthography might influence
the process of word recognition was first explored by Stone,
Vanhoy, and Van Orden (1997).
Stone et al. (1997) argued that the process of word
recognition is best explained by a model that includes both
feedforward and feedback connections (resonance) between
orthographic and phonological units. As support for this
claim, they reported feedback consistency effects in LDT.
Feedback inconsistent words are words for which the body
can be spelled in more that one way (e.g., /-ADE/ in FADE
can be spelled /-AID/ or /-AYED/ as in PAID or
SWAYED), whereas feedback consistent words are words
for which the body can only be spelled one way (e.g., /IMP/ in LIMP). Stone et al. observed slower lexical
decision latencies for feedback inconsistent words than for
feedback consistent words. Accordingly, they suggested
that, when a feedback inconsistent word is processed in an
LDT, the phonological representation can activate, via
feedback connections, orthographic representations for
several word bodies. These orthographic representations
will compete with each other, and this competition will slow
the recognition process. In a replication study, Zeigler,
Montant, and Jacobs (1997) also reported feedback
consistency effects, thus supporting the notion that feedback
activation can influence word recognition performance.
Although much current research supports the feedback
account, it should also be noted that Peereman, Content, and
Bonin (1998) reported a failure to replicate feedback
consistency effects with French stimuli in LDT. Peereman et
al. suggested that whereas homophone effects in various
tasks “can be interpreted as showing that lexical
phonological codes reverberate to orthographic word forms,

they do not imply interactions between orthographic codes
and phonological codes at the sublexical level” and argued
for a “restricted interactivity account in which interactions
are limited to lexical processing levels” (p. 170).
Pexman et al.’s (2001) feedback account of homophone
effects in LDT also involved interactivity at the lexical
level, although did not deny the possibility of sublexical
interaction. Pexman et al. suggested that, when the
phonological representation of a member of the homophone
pair is activated, it feeds back to the orthographic
representations for both spellings of the word. Thus, while
some of the feedback is directed towards the representation
for the correct orthographic unit, some of it is also captured
by activity in the orthographic representation of the
incorrect homophone mate, thus creating competition and
resulting in longer decision latencies for homophones. This
account involves the assumption that LDT responses are
made primarily on the basis of activation in the orthographic
units (see Pexman & Lupker, 1999, and Pexman et al.,
2001, for more detailed explanations of this assumption).

The Present Research
If it is the case that phonology feeds back to, and creates
competition in, the orthographic units, then it becomes
important to characterize and attempt to understand the
exact nature of this orthographic competition. In previous
research there have been several different suggestions about
the nature of orthographic representations. As mentioned
above, one suggestion is that feedback activation from
phonology influences activation of whole word orthographic
representations (Peereman et al., 1998; Pexman et al., 2001).
There have also been suggestions about the sublexical
orthographic representations that might be activated by
feedback from phonology. These sublexical representations
have been described as grapheme based (Zeigler et al.,
1997) or syllabically based, with feedback to onset and
rhyme units (Stone et al., 1997), however, both Ziegler et al.
and Stone et al. acknowledged that other levels of
orthographic representation could be activated via feedback.
There is, in fact, a suggestion that several different grainsizes of units are activated in the process of word
recognition, such that feedback activation would influence
both lexical and sublexical levels of orthographic
representation (Taft & van Graan, 1998). The purpose of the
present research was to investigate the grain-size of
orthographic units activated by feedback from phonology.
To do this, we investigated whether homophone effects are
modulated by the type of orthographic overlap that exists
between homophone mates. In previous investigations of
homophone effects in LDT (e.g., Pexman et al., 2001;
Pexman & Lupker, 1999; Rubenstein et al., 1971)
homophone pairs have only been categorized by frequency.
Yet homophone pairs vary widely in orthographic overlap;
some homophone pairs differ only by a single internal
grapheme (e.g., BERTH-BIRTH), while others differ by
onset and also by word body (e.g., ATE-EIGHT). Our
question for the present research was whether these
sublexical differences in orthographic overlap lead to

differences in the size of observed homophone effects. To
this end, we created nine separate categories of
homophones. Our aim was to divide homophones according
to types of sublexical, orthographic overlap within
homophone pairs (see Table 1), but our divisions between
categories were also unavoidably influenced by the type of
homophones that tend to occur in English. We restricted our
analysis to low frequency homophones that have higher
frequency mates since these were the homophones that
produced the largest effects in Pexman et al. (2001).
In the following experiments we presented low
frequency homophones from each homophone pair in the
above homophone categories, along with sets of low
frequency non-homophonic control words matched to the
low frequency homophones. Our tasks were 3 LDTs, across
which we manipulated the type of foils presented, to create
task conditions that required less vs. more extensive
processing. In Experiment 1A foils were consonant strings
(e.g., PRNVR), in Experiment 1B foils were pseudowords
(e.g., PRANE), and in Experiment 1C foils were
pseudohomophones (e.g., BRANE). Pexman et al. (2001),
and Pexman and Lupker (1999) have reported that when
foils are more word like (e.g., pseudohomophones),
homophone effects are larger. The explanation is that
pseudohomophone foils create a difficult LDT, in which
participants tend to process all of the stimuli more
extensively. With more extensive processing, there is more
opportunity for feedback activation to influence activation at
the orthographic level and, hence, more competition and
larger homophone effects. By using progressively more
difficult LDTs, we hoped to capture homophone effects at
several different “moments” of processing, allowing for
more thorough contrasts between the homophone categories.

Method
Participants
The participants in these experiments were undergraduate
students at the University of Calgary. There were 35
participants in Experiment 1A, 37 participants in
Experiment 1B, and 41 participants in Experiment 1C.

Stimuli
Words The words used in this experiment were 95
homophones (mean frequency = 16.92 per million; Kucera
& Francis, 1967) and 95 control words (mean frequency =
15.43) matched for frequency, onset, length and
neighbourhood size (Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, &
Besner, 1977).
Foils Foil stimuli were required in all three parts of the
experiment. There were 95 foils of each of the three types:
consonant strings (Experiment 1A), pseudowords
(Experiment 1B), and pseudohomophones (Experiment 1C).

Procedure
On each trial, a letter string was presented in the center of a
17-inch Sony Trinitron monitor controlled by a Macintosh

G3 and presented using PsyScope (Cohen, MacWhinney,
Flatt & Provost, 1993). Lexical decision responses were
made by pressing either the left button (labelled NO) or the
right button (labelled YES) on a PsyScope response box.

Experiment 1A – Results and Discussion
For this and each of the following experiments, mean
decision latencies, mean error percentages, and homophone
effect sizes for each category are presented in Table 1. In all
analyses, data were analyzed with subjects (F1 or t1) and,
separately, items (F2 or t2) treated as random factors.
To test the view that whole-word units are the important
orthographic units for feedback activation, we conducted a 9
(homophone category type) X 2 (homophony) ANOVA to
see if the effects of homophony varied by category. The
overall homophone effect was significant in the latency
analysis (F1(1, 34) = 6.73, p < .05, MSE = 3514.11; F2(1,
86) = 4.26, p < .05, MSE = 916.53), and in the error analysis
(F1(1, 34) = 18.87, p < .001, MSE = 128.50; F2(1, 86) =
18.86, p < .001, MSE = 36.66). Thus, we confirmed the
existence of homophone effects in LDT, replicating the
results of Pexman et al. (2001), but here with a larger set of
items and with consonant string foils. There was a main
effect of category in the latency analysis (F1(8, 27) = 3.81, p
< .01, MSE = 3422.01; F2(8, 86) = 2.37, p <.05, MSE =
1514.47) and in the error analysis (F1(8, 27) = 5.08, p < .01,
MSE = 54.31; F2(8, 86) = 1.90, p = .07, MSE = 46.84). The
interaction of category and homophony was not significant
in the latency analysis (F1(8, 27) = 1.71, p = .13, MSE =
4446.21; F2(8, 86) = 1.47, p = .18, MSE = 916.53) but was
significant in the error analysis by subjects (F1(8, 27) =
5.19, p < .01, MSE = 38.05; F2(8, 86) = 1.71, p = .11, MSE
= 36.66). These effects indicate that the size of the
homophone effects differed somewhat across the nine
categories of homophones. Since this LDT involved
consonant string foils, decisions could be made on the basis
of relatively shallow processing.
As illustrated in Table 1, none of the homophone effects
were significant in both latency and error analyses.
Significant latency effects were observed for the Body Only
and Onset and Body categories, and significant error effects
were observed for the Single Vowel Only, Silent E or Word
Internal Dipthong, /-s/ Morpheme, and Silent Onset and
Body categories. In the case of the Single Vowel Only and
Silent Onset and Body categories, error rates were relatively
high for the homophones (15.0 % and 10.0 %, respectively).
These error rates are surprisingly high for a LDT involving
consonant string foils, and suggest that some of our
participants may not have known some of these
homophones (e.g., BERTH, WHOLLY, etc.). In the latency
analyses for these categories, which include only correct
responses, there were no differences between latencies for
homophones and latencies for control words. Thus, the error
effects in these categories may not really be indicative of
orthographic competition. Hence, in the following
experiments we draw conclusions only about homophone
effects that are significant in both latency and error
analyses.

Experiment 1B – Results and Discussion
In the 9 (homophone category type) X 2 (homophony)
ANOVA, the overall homophone effect was significant in
the latency analysis (F1(1, 36) = 43.01, p < .001, MSE =
3118.18; F2(1, 86) = 21.57, p < .001, MSE = 2966.35), and
in the error analysis (F1(1, 36) = 75.17, p < .001, MSE =
139.16; F2(1, 86) = 18.09, p < .001, MSE = 150.30). The
main effect of category was significant in the latency
analysis (F1(8, 29) = 5.55, p < .001, MSE = 3147.14; F2(8,
86) = 2.52, p <.05, MSE = 6521.49) and in the error analysis
(F1(8, 29) = 8.39, p < .001, MSE = 77.04; F2(8, 86) = 2.19,
p < .05, MSE = 178.82). Importantly, the interaction of
category and homophony was significant in the latency
analysis (F1(8, 29) = 5.74, p < .001, MSE = 3007.84; F2(8,
86) = 2.34, p < .05, MSE = 2966.35) and was significant by
subjects in the error analysis (F1(8, 29) = 11.69, p < .001,
MSE = 74.91; F2(8, 86) = 1.80, p = .09, MSE = 150.30).
These effects indicate that the size of the homophone effects
differed across the nine categories of homophones. This
result confirms that homophone effects vary by category
and reveals that the source of homophone effects is not only

competition from whole-word orthographic units. Thus, it is
not the case that homophone effects arise whenever one
phonological representation maps onto two orthographic
representations. The magnitude of homophone effects seems
to depend to some extent on competition between
orthographic units that represent the sublexical structure of
the homophones.
As illustrated in Table 1, homophone effects were
observed in this experiment for 5 of the 9 types of
homophones. The largest homophone effects seemed to
arise in the categories of homophones that differ from their
high frequency mates in onset structure (as long as the onset
is articulated, since there was no effect in latencies for the
Silent Onset and Body category), body structure, or by a
single vowel grapheme (although not for the EA or EE
Grapheme category).
Notably, the /-ed/ Morpheme homophones actually
produced an effect in the reverse direction, while the /-s/
Morpheme homophones produced a null effect in the
latency analysis. A tentative conclusion is that homophone
effects do not arise for homophones that differ in
morphological structure from their homophone mates (e.g.,
GUESSED-GUEST). Before interpreting this result any

further, we examined effect sizes for all categories again in
Experiment 1C.

Experiment 1C – Results and Discussion
As in Experiment 1B, the overall homophone effect was
again significant in the latency analysis (F1(1, 40) = 77.58,
p < .001, MSE = 9481.57; F2(1, 86) = 35.62, p < .001, MSE
= 7658.91), and in the error analysis (F1(1, 40) = 170.92, p
< .001, MSE = 138.34; F2(1, 86) = 27.68, p < .001, MSE =
212.49). There was a main effect of Category in the latency
analysis (F1(8, 33) = 7.93, p < .001, MSE = 7307.81; F2(8,
86) = 2.24, p <.05, MSE = 13926.27) and in the error
analysis (F1(8, 33) = 24.87, p < .001, MSE = 87.94; F2(8,
86) = 2.59, p < .05, MSE = 235.16). There was also an
interaction of Category and Homophony that was significant
by subjects in the latency analysis (F1(8, 33) = 2.74, p < .01,
MSE = 7082.59; F2 < 1) and in the error analysis (F1(8, 33)
= 13.20, p < .001, MSE = 87.14; F2 (8, 86) = 1.54, p = .16,
MSE = 212.49). These effects indicate that the size of the
homophone effects differed across the nine categories of
homophones.
As in Experiment 1B, the greatest homophone effects in
Experiment 1C were observed in the categories where
homophone pairs differed by a vowel grapheme or by onsetbody units. These effects affirm the notion that graphemes
and onset-body units are important sources of competition
for homophones. The implication is that these units receive
feedback activation from phonology.
The /-ed/ Morpheme category demonstrated facilitation
for homophones in Experiment 1B, yet, in Experiment 1C
with pseudohomophone foils, we found that this facilitation
disappeared and a null homophone effect was observed
instead. This finding, along with the relatively small
homophone effects observed for the /-s/ Morpheme category
across foil conditions, suggests that homophone effects are
not generally observed for pairs of homophones that have
different morphological structure. There are two possible
interpretations of these null homophone effects. One
interpretation is that the orthographic representations for the
two members of the homophone pairs are so similar that no
competition arises. The second interpretation is that the
orthographic representations for the two members of the
homophone pairs are so different that no confusion or
competition arises. We would tend to support the latter
interpretation. If one ignored morphological structure, the
homophones in the /-ed/ Morpheme category could be
classified as Body Only homophones. Yet the Body Only
homophones produced quite robust homophone effects
compared to those produced by the /-ed/ Morpheme
homophones. Therefore, the morphological structure of the
/-ed/ homophones is an important factor in explaining the
null (and sometimes facilitory) effects for that category.
Homophones like GUESSED, that have different
morphological characteristics than their homophone mates
(GUEST), are apparently not confused with their
homophone mates at the orthographic level. The extra
morpheme /-ed/ seems to create an orthographic

representation that is easily distinguished from the
orthographic representation for the homophone mate.
As in Experiment 1B, the homophone effect for the
Silent Onset and Body category in Experiment 1C was not
significant in the latency analysis (although it was
significant by subjects in the error analysis). Again, there
are two possible interpretations for a null (or relatively
small) homophone effect. One possible interpretation is that
the representations for the words in these homophone pairs
are so similar that minimal competition arises. That is,
‘silent’ letters may not have much bearing on the nature of
orthographic representations for words like WHOLLY or
KNOT. Hence KNOT may be encoded very much like
NOT, with little competition arising. The second
interpretation is that the representations for the words in
these pairs are so different that minimal competition arises.
That is, because the onsets and many of the bodies are
orthographically different within the homophone pairs,
KNOT may be easily distinguished from NOT, resulting in
minimal competition. We tend to favour the first
interpretation. The reason for this is that the homophone
effect for the Onset and Body category is much larger than
the homophone effect for the Silent Onset and Body
category. The fact that the effect size is markedly smaller
for the Silent Onset and Body category suggests that the
silent onsets are not competing in the same way that the
articulated onsets are, causing smaller (non-significant)
homophone effects.

General Discussion
The purpose of the present research was to conduct a precise
examination of the orthographic factors that modulate
homophone effects, in order to determine the grain size of
units activated by feedback activation from phonology.
The homophone effects observed in the experiments
reported here provide support for the notion that phonology
is activated in the process of visual word recognition and
feeds back to units in orthography. We also observed
differences in the extent to which different types of
homophones produced homophone effects. Analysis of
effect sizes for our homophone categories revealed that
homophone effect sizes varied by sublexical orthographic
overlap of homophone mates. Homophone effects were
greatest when the members of homophone pairs differ by a
single vowel grapheme, or by the word body, or by the word
body and articulated onset, within one morpheme boundary.
In terms of identifying precisely what the levels of
sublexical representation are, the trends in our data suggest
that the levels likely correspond to graphemes, and onsets
and bodies. We acknowledge, however, that the ambiguities
inherent in the orthography of English homophones (e.g.,
some of our homophones differed slightly on orthographic
properties other than those defined by the category labels,
many of our categories were “grapheme” categories since
these are the most common type of English homophone
pairs) prevent us from making stronger conclusions.
Nonetheless, the cross-category differences in our
homophone effects make it apparent that the feedback

process does not reflect a mapping of phonology onto only
whole word constituents at the orthographic level. This is
not to say that lexical units are not also involved in the
feedback process. According to the model depicted in
Figure 1, activation at sublexical levels within the
orthographic units feeds up to the lexical level. Presumably,
activation at the lexical level must reach a certain point
before a response is made. For homophones, responses seem
to be delayed by competition at sublexical levels within the
orthographic units. These delays are most obvious when an
LDT is difficult (e.g., with pseudohomophone foils),
because a higher threshold of activation is set and hence
competition must be more fully resolved before a response
is made.
These data provide support for a fully interactive model
of word recognition, in which sublexical information is part
of the orthographic and phonological components (e.g.,
Plaut et al., 1996; Taft & van Graan, 1998; Van Orden &
Goldinger, 1994). The homophone effects reported in this
paper suggest that there is bi-directional activation between
the orthographic and phonological components of such a
model, and that this activation is captured in several
different grain-sizes of representation.
