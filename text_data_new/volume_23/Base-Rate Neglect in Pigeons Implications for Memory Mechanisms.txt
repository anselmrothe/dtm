A bstract
In delayed m atching-to-sam ple, there is an initial (or
sam ple) stim ulus and tw o test(orcom parison)stim uli.
W hen pigeons are trained to m atch,they presum ably
choose betw een the tw o com parison stim uliaccording
to their ability to rem em ber the sam ple. W hen the
sam ple cannot be rem em bered, com parison choice
should depend on the history of reinforcem ent
associated w ith each ofthecom parison stim uli(i.e.,the
com parison base rates). In the present research,
pigeons acquired tw o m atching tasksin w hich sam ples
S1 and S2 w ere each associated w ith one of tw o
com parisonsC1and C2(equalexperiencew ith both trial
types),and sam ples S1 and S3 w ere each associated
w ith one oftw o othercom parisons C3 and C 4 (equal
experience w ith both trial types). A s the retention
interval increased, the pigeons show ed a bias to
choose the com parison (C 1 orC 3)associated w ith the
m ore frequently occurring sam ple (S1).Thus,pigeons
are sensitive, not just to the probability of
reinforcem ent associated w ith the each of the
com parison stim uli (i.e., the base rates) w hich w ere
equal,butalso to the(irrelevant)likelihoodthateach of
the sam ples w as presented (i.e.,base-rate neglect).

Introduction
H um ansare know n to underestim atetheeffectof base rates
associated w ith probability of being correct(K ahnem an &
Tversky 1972).In a classic problem proposed by Tversky
and K anem an (1980,p.62),participants are told that85% of
thetaxis in a city are green w hileonly 15% are blue(thebase
rates).They are also told thata w itness to a hit-and-run
accident involving a taxi identified the taxi as blue.
Furtherm ore,they are told that under sim ilar conditions
w itnesses correctly identify the colorofa taxi80% ofthe
tim e.W hen participants are then asked, “W hat is the
probability that the taxi involved in the accident w as
actually blue?” m ostofthem say thatitisvery likely thatthe
taxiis blue.In m aking this judgem enttheparticipantsfailto
considersufficiently thebase-rateprobabilities.W hen base
rate is considered,the conditionalprobability ofcorrectly
identifying abluetaxiis p(blue|judgem entcorrect)= p(blue)

x p(correct) = .15 x .80 = .12, w hereas the probability of
saying it w as blue w hen it actually w as green is
p(green|judgem entincorrect)= p(green)x p(incorrect)= .85
x .20 = .17.This m eans thatthe probability ofbeing correct
underthese conditions is only .12/(.12 + .17)= .41,orless
than 50% .Thus,hum ans often failto considersufficiently
the probability ofbeing correctin the absence ofthe eyew itness inform ation.A lthough there are certain conditions
under w hich hum ans can be induced to perform m ore
accurately (e.g., G igerenzer & H offrage, 1995), base-rate
neglectislikely responsible form anyexaggeratedfearssuch
as air travel, w alking the streets of N ew Y ork C ity, and
having one’s children killed atschoolby a fellow student.
A n analogous situation can be designed for an anim al
using a m atching-to-sam ple task.M atching-to-sam ple is a
conditionaldiscrim ination in w hich the identity oftheinitial
or sam ple stim ulus indicates w hich oftw o (orm ore)testor
com parison stim uliis correct(Skinner,1950).A ccording to
H artland Fantino (1996),com parison choice for pigeons
should depend on tw o factors,the relative probabilities of
reinforcem ent associated w ith the com parisons (i.e., the
baserates)in theabsence ofthesam ple,and theconditional
probability of each com parison being correct given
presentation ofone ofthe sam ples (i.e.,the actualsam ple
eventor the evidence,given the base rates).In the case of
m atching-to-sam ple,the probability ofreinforcem entgiven
the sam ple is typically 1.0.This ensures thatthe task has
been adequately acquired and thatthe contingencies have
been adequately experienced.B iases can be introduced by
m anipulating the ratio of sam ples and the probability of
reinforcem entforchoices of the m atching com parison (see
G oodie & Fantino,1995,forsim ilarfindings w ith hum ans,
butsee also G oodie & Fantino,1996,forexceptions).
C ontrol by the com parisons alone can be increased by
degrading thesam plesatthetim eofcom parison choice (i.e.,
by increasing the probability ofpoorm em ory,or in thetaxi
exam ple,ofan identification error).O new ay to degrade the
sam ples is by introducing adelay betw een the offsetof the
sam ple and the onsetofthe com parisons.A ssum ing that
the com parison stim uliare correctequally often overtrials,
and thatthe probability ofreinforcem entis the sam e fora
correctresponseto each com parison,onew ould expectthat
w ith increasing delay,the slopes of the pigeons’retention
functions w ould be quite sim ilar(see G rant,1991;W hite &

W ixted,1999).
The analog to base rate in a m atching task is the
probability ofbeing correctin the absence ofinform ation
about the sam ple (i.e., the relative probability of
reinforcem ent associated w ith each of the com parison
stim uli).A ccording to W hite and W ixted (1999), pigeons
should be sensitive to base-rateprobabilities,butgenerally
thebaseratesand theprobability ofsam ple presentation are
thesam e (both generally 0.5).In the presentexperim entw e
asked ifpigeons are able to estim ate the probability of a
correctcom parison response w hen the sam ple probabilities
are different from the base rates. There are a num ber
procedures thatm ightbe used to m anipulate the relative
frequency of sam ple (S) presentation w hile m aintaining
equalprobability ofreinforcem entforcom parison (C)choice
(i.e.,equalbase rates).In the presentexperim ent,w e chose
tointroduceasecond2-sam ple-2-com parison m atching task.
Each of the tw o m atching tasks involved a differentpairof
com parison stim uli but the tw o tasks shared a com m on
sam ple.Thus,thetw o taskscan berepresented S1-C1,S2-C2
and S1-C3,S3-C4(w ithC1and C2alw aysappearing together
and C3 and C4 alw ays appearing together). If each of the
four trial types appears equally often, each of the
com parisons w ould be associated w ith reinforcem ent on
25% ofthe reinforced trials.H ow ever,the sam e w ould not
be true of the sam ples.S2 and S3 w ould each be presented
on 25% ofthe trials,w hereasS1w ould bepresented on 50%
of the trials. U nder conditions w ith no delay, one w ould
expecta high levelofm atching accuracy and no bias.B utif
adelay is inserted betw een the offsetof the sam ple and the
onset of the com parisons, errors should increase. If
com parison choice depends on the reinforcem ent
contingencies associated w ith com parison choice,errors
should notresult in a com parison bias.In the absence of
m em ory forthe sam ple,the probability ofreinforcem entof
com parison choice should be 50% for either com parison in
eithertask.Furtherm ore,ifthere is m em ory forthe sam ple,
theconditionalprobability ofreinforcem entassociated w ith
com parisonchoiceshould bethesam e foreithercom parison
in eitherm atching task.H ow ever,ifpigeons show a biasby
using theirreference m em ory ofsam ple presentations,they
should access m ore instances ofS1 than ofeitherS2 orS3
and a bias to choose C 1 and C 3 m ay result.

M ethod
Subjects
The subjects w ere eight W hite C arneaux pigeons,
purchased as retired breeders (5-8 years old) from the
Palm etto Pigeon Plant (Sum ter, SC ). The pigeons w ere
m aintained at 80% of their free-feeding body w eights
throughouttheexperim entand w ere caged individually w ith
gritand w atercontinually available in the hom e cage. The

pigeons w ere m aintained on a 12:12-h,light:dark cycle. A ll
pigeons had previously served in an unrelated study
involving sim ple sim ultaneous discrim inations.

A pparatus
The experim ent w as conducted in a standard B R S/LV E
(Laurel,M D ) sound attenuating pigeon testcham ber.Three
rectangularresponsekeys(2.5cm high x3 cm w ide and 1 cm
apart) w ere aligned horizontally and centered on the
response panel.M ounted behind each response key w as a
12-stim ulus inline projector (Industrial Electronics
Engineering,Series 10,V an N uys,C A ,)thatcould projecta
red hue or a green hue onto the any ofthe three response
keys ora plain w hite field onto the center response key.In
addition,the leftand rightprojectors could projecta w hite
circle and a w hite dot.A houselightlocated atthe center of
the cham berceiling provided generalillum ination.A rearm ounted grain feeder w as centered horizontally on the
response panelm idw ay betw een the pecking keys and the
floor of the cham ber. W hen operated, the feeder w as
accessible through a 5.0 x 5.5 cm litaperture in theresponse
panel. R einforcem ent consisted of 2.0-s access to Purina
Pro G rains.W hite noise and an exhaustfan m ounted on the
outside of the cham ber m asked extraneous noise. The
experim entw as controlled by a m icrocom puterlocated in an
adjacentroom .

Procedure
Training A ll pigeons w ere placed directly on 0-s-delay
m atching-to-sam ple training.A tthe beginning ofeach trial,
the center key (sam ple) w as illum inated. Follow ing 10
responses to the sam ple,the sam ple w as turned offand the
side (com parison) keys w ere illum inated. C om parison
stim uliw ere presented random ly w ith respect to location,
w ith the restriction thata particularhue could notoccur on
the sam e side key for m ore than three consecutive trials.
O neresponseto eithercom parison constituted achoiceand
term inated the trial. Correctcom parison responses resulted
in a 2-sec presentation of food and a 10-sec intertrial
interval. Incorrect choices resulted in the 10-sec intertrial
intervalalone.
For each pigeon,training consisted of a hybrid m atching
task involving three sam ple stim uli(one pertrial)and tw o
pairs ofcom parison stim uli(one pairon each trial). O n one
fourth ofthe trials, one of the hues served as the sam ple
(S1)w ith red and green com parison stim uli(C1 and C2)on
the side keys and,forexam ple,red w as correct. O n another
fourth of the trials, a different hue sam ple (S2) w as
presented w ith thered andgreen com parison stim uliand,for
exam ple,green w as correct.
O n halfofthe rem aining trials,S1 w as again presented as
the sam ple and circle and dot w ere presented as the

com parisons (w ith, for exam ple, dot correct). O n the
rem aining fourth ofthe trials a third hue w as presented as
the sam ple (S3)and circle and dot w ere presented as the
com parisons (w ith circle correct).
The three sam ple hues w ere counterbalanced such that
each hueserved asthe one-to-m any sam ple for 2-3 pigeons
and each of the rem aining sam ples w as associated w ith the
huecom parisonsforatleastonepigeon.Sessionsconsisted
of96 trials and w ere conducted 6 days a w eek. For each
pigeon,criterion w as m etw hen the correctcom parison for
each trialtype w as chosen on atleast90% ofthosetrials for
tw o consecutivesessions.Follow ing criterion perform ance,
each pigeon received five sessions of overtraining.

transferred to a m ixed-delay m atching procedure in w hich
theoffsetofthesam ple w as separated from the onsetofthe
side keys by a dark retention intervalof0,2,4,or8 s.For

involving each retention interval. The retention test
consistedof2sessionsand thereinforcem entcontingencies

D iscussion
A ccording to traditionalinstrum entalview s ofconditional
discrim ination learning (i.e., H artl & Fantino, 1996), the
probability ofacom parison choiceshould bedeterm ined by
theconditionalprobabilityassociatedw ith each com parison
stim ulus,given the sam ple,and,ifthesam ple is unavailable
or forgotten, w ith the probability of reinforcem ent
associated w ith each com parison (independently of the
sam ple).Thus,the choice a particularcom parison (e.g.,C1)
should depend on both the num berofsam ple-com parison
pairings (e.g.,S1-C 1)thatare follow ed by reinforcem ent,as
w ellas the num berofreinforcem ents associated w ith that
com parison,independentofthe sam ple (W ixted,1993).In
the present experim ent, the conditional probability of
reinforcem entassociated w ith each of the com parisons,
Figure 1.R etention functions follow ing training in w hich
tw o and sam ples, S1 and S2, w ere associated w ith
com parison stim uli,C 1 C 2,respectively and S1 and S3w ere
associated w ith com parisonsC3and C4,respectively.Thus,
S2and S3 w ere involved in one-to-onem atching (O TO )w ith
C 2 and C 4,w hile the third sam ple,S1,w as associated w ith
tw o com parison stim uli,C 1 and C 3 (one-to-m any m atching,
O TM ).In training and test,each com parison w asassociated
w ith reinforcem ent on 50% of the trials and C 1 and C 2
alw ays appeared together as did C 3 and C 4.
given one of the sam ples, w as equal. Furtherm ore, the
probability ofreinforcem entassociated w ith choiceofeither
com parison w asalso equal.Thus,in thepresentexperim ent,
given presentation ofC 1 and C 2,the only relevantsam plecom parison associations determ ining com parison choice
should be S1-C1 and S2-C2.If so,delay-induced sam ple
degradation should have had a sym m etrical effect on
com parison choiceand theretention functionsshould have
been paralleland overlapping.

In the present experim ent, clearly divergent retention
functionsw erefound.T heseresultsrequire them odification
of current theories of delayed conditional discrim ination
perform ance (e.g.,W hite & W ixted,1999)because pigeons
choice behavioris influenced notonly by the probability of
reinforcem entassociated w ith responding to each of the
com parison stim uli and to the conditional probabilities
associated w ith choice of the com parison stim uli as a
function ofm em ory forthe sam ple butalso by the relative
frequenciesofthe sam ples.W hen delaysare introduced,as
thedelay increases,pigeonshaveanincreasing tendency to
selectthe com parison associated w ith the m ore frequently
presented sam ple, even though that sam ple w as not
presented m ore often than the alternative sam ple in the
context ofeithercom parison pair.Itis as if,on trials w hen
m em ory for the sam ple is poor, presentation of the
com parisons causes the pigeons to consult theirreference
m em ory forthe overallprobability ofsam ple presentation
(independentof the com parison pair).
O f broader interest, such use of reference m em ory in
delayed m atching m ay be a generalphenom enon.H ow ever,
the use ofsam ple frequency independently ofotherm ore
relevantm easures m ay beapparentonly w ith adesign such
as thatused in the presentresearch because in the m ore
typicaldesign,eitherhypothesis m akesthesam eprediction.
A lternatively, in the present experim ent, although the
pigeons had equalopportunity to acquire each ofthe four
sam ple-com parison associations, the m ore frequent
presentations ofthe S1 sam ple could have allow ed itto be
m ore efficiently coded,betterm aintained in m em ory,orm ore
easily retrieved from m em ory. That is, at the tim e of
com parison choice, w hen the S1 stim ulus had been the
sam ple,itm ayhave been m ore accessible than the S2 or S3
stim uli w ere w hen they had been the sam ple. B ut if the
difference in slope of the retention functions w as
attributable to differencesin sam ple accessibility atthetim e
the com parisons w ere presented,both theS1 and the S2/S3
functions should have approached 50% correct w ith
increasing retention interval. Instead, the S1 retention
function appears to have leveled off, w hile the S2/S3
retention function declines below chance atdelaysof4and
8 sec.Such retention functions suggest that rather than
betterretrievalofthe S1 sam ple,the pigeons developed a
com parison bias to choose thecom parison associated w ith
the m ore frequently presented sam ple.
This com parison biasin pigeonsisanalogousto the base-

rate neglectshow n by hum ans w hen they failto consider
sufficiently the base-rate probability of occurrence of an
event.
