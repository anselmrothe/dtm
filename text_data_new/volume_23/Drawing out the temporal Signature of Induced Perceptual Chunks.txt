Abstract

Chunking and Pausing Behaviour
The effect of chunking in the process of drawing was
investigated using a task domain consisting of simple
hierarchically organized geometrical patterns, which
participants learnt to draw. The study focused upon the
latencies between drawing actions. A new technique for
the identification of chunks was devised, based on
patterns in the magnitudes of latency. The technique was
significantly better than the use of a fixed latency
threshold. It was discovered that there was a strong
temporal signature of the underlying chunk structure and
that effects of learning were evident.

Introduction
The concepts of chunking and the limited size of
memory span, first proposed by Miller (1956), underlie
many modern theories of human cognition. The
phenomenon has been verified in many domains
(Vicente, 1988), and at most levels of cognitive
processing in both humans and nonverbal organisms
(Terrance, 1991). Given the pivotal role of chunking it
is, perhaps, surprising that there has been little research
on the role of chunking in drawing. There has been
some research on: low level motor behaviour
constraints on drawing (Van Sommers, 1984), the
functions of drawing in high level cognitive tasks such
as design (Akin, 1986) and, drawing as a reflection of
children’s cognitive development (Goodnow & Levine,
1973). However, direct investigations of the role of
chunking in the process of drawing are absent.
We are conducting studies that begin to address this
deficiency in the understanding of this prominent
human ability. Our approach is to have participants
learn specially designed named geometric shapes, from
verbal labels, which they then reproduced from memory
– drawing out induced perceptual chunks. This paper
focuses on whether chunks are apparent in temporal
characteristics of drawing. Specifically, we have
discovered that the absolute duration of pauses between
drawing actions, the latencies, reflects the hierarchical
structure of induced chunks and reveals the effect of
learning by the composition of chunks. Further, we
have found that local maxima in the latencies are better
discriminators of boundaries between separate chunks
than a fixed latency threshold.
Previous work on chunking and drawing will first be
discussed to set the context for this work.

The idea that latencies or pauses might be a means by
which one can segment data in order to discriminate
chunk boundaries, arises from research conducted by
Chase and Simon (1973). They defined an operational
method by which to characterize chunks. In recall and
memory tasks the latency distributions for betweenglance placements of chess pieces, which were taken to
indicate boundaries between chunks, were significantly
longer than within-glance placements, which were
taken to indicate items within a chunk. Hence, items
with pauses below a certain threshold could be
considered as within a chunk and items with longer
pauses above the threshold could be considered to be
between chunks. The use of thresholds as one means to
distinguish chunks has been supported by studies in
domains such as: Chess (Chase & Simon, 1973; Gobet,
1998), Go (Rittman, 1976,1980), and electronic circuits
(Egan & Schwartz 1979).
A significant pause can be defined as a latency
greater than a static threshold typically within the range
2 to 5 seconds (Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983).
Although, in studies of drawing, researchers have used
pauses as low as 1 second to segment data into chunks
(Akin, 1986; Ullman, 1990).
However, there are difficulties with the use of latency
thresholds to differentiate chunk boundaries (Holden,
1992; Gobet, 1998). Firstly, there is no one threshold
that holds across different task domains (Chase &
Simon 1973; Egan & Schwartz, 1979; Akin, 1986;
Ullman, 1990; Gobet & Simon, 1998). However, a
threshold can be found by training participants in a
domain and then testing them (Reitman, 1976).
Secondly, it has been observed that when learning takes
place, as in the transition from novice to expert, latency
times for chunk boundaries decrease (Chase & Simon
1973; Reitman, 1976; Egan and Schwartz, 1979).
Thresholds must be changed dynamically over time to
cope with individual differences. Thirdly, for memories
that are organized hierarchically (Palmer, 1977), the
higher the chunk is in the hierarchy the more subchunks
it contains and the longer it takes to recall (Reitman,
1976). A single threshold might elicit chunks at one
level but not its subchunks or higher order chunks.
This paper proposes an alternative approach to
thresholds for the identification of chunks using

latencies between drawing actions. By focusing on
patterns over successive latencies the new technique
can overcome some of the limitations of fixed
thresholds.
Here, we define latency for a particular element as
the time between lifting the pen off the paper at the end
of one element and the time at which the pen touches
the paper again at the beginning of marking the current
element. The same holds for mouse button up and down
actions when dragging a line on a computer screen.

The Nature of Drawing
Intuitively and theoretically there are various reasons to
believe that understanding the role of chunks in the
process of drawing will be a challenge. First, consider
the recall and the drawing of a perceptual chunk given a
verbal label for that chunk. A succession of processes
are involved, including: the recall of the chunk, the
planning of the order in which to produce the elements
of a chunk, the planning of where to draw each
individual element, and, the execution of the motor
actions to make a mark for the element. It seems likely
that such a sequence of processes would hide any
hierarchical organization of chunks in long-term
memory. Second, it appears unlikely that these
processes would occur in a strictly serial manner and
they are likely to be interleaved to different extents.
This will probably mask any attempt to analyze the
underlying structure of chunks. Third, the process of
planning might in itself interfere with the recall of
chunks and so potentially prevent each chunk from
being recalled in a single burst of activity (Reitman,
1976). One might reasonably assume that analysis of
latencies within this area would reflect planning and
action, rather than chunking. Fourth, the processes of
mark making, including subjects sensitivity to methods
of motor efficiencies (Akin, 1986), might interact with
the recall of chunks. For example, the speed of making
a mark may vary with the hierarchical chunk level of
the current element being drawn and so interfere with
the apparent recall latency of the next element.
Despite all these reasons, the experiment reported
here demonstrates that the duration of pauses between
the drawing of individual elements is highly indicative

of the structure of chunks in memory. It appears that far
from diluting any information about the underlying
organization of chunks, the duration of latencies in the
process of drawing seems to provide a temporal
signature for perceptual chunks.
The next section presents the drawing domain and
task used in the experiments. The following section
describes the discovery of patterns in the latencies that
were highly suggestive of a temporal signature of
chunks. The experiment and results that demonstrate
the reality of these patterns are then considered in turn.
The implications of the findings are considered in the
final discussion section.

Domain, Stimuli and Tasks
To study the behavioural manifestations of chunking in
drawing a special ‘shape’ domain consisting of named
geometric patterns was devised; examples are shown in
Figure 1. Initially participants were taught six basic
patterns, such as Figure 1a and 1b, and they drew
several examples of them when given their names. They
were then shown pairs of names of basic patterns to
draw overlaid upon each other; Figure 1c. These
composite patterns were then separately named; Figure
1d. The composite patterns consist of four lines and a
typical drawing task involves drawing a sequence of
different composite patterns in a row beside a written
list of names.
Features of the design of the domain that make it
highly suited to the study of chunking behaviour are:
(1) the use of simple predefined shapes to make errors
in recall or drawing easily identifiable, (2) the definition
of a fixed hierarchy of patterns, with known nesting of
levels and no overlapping of elements over chunks at
the same level, (3) the participants learn the patterns, so
the specific chunks and their organisation is known a
priori, (4) verbal labels are used as stimuli to make
participants recall the perceptual chunk from long-term
memory, (5) the composite chunks consist of a small
number of sub-chunks to keep demands on working
memory low, (6) the outline square is drawn before
each pattern to ensure drawing processes are fully
engaged when the pattern is produced.

The domain has three chunk levels: (level 1) lines
within chunks, (level 2) basic patterns, (level 3) composite patterns. Thus, every line was coded depending on
the order in which they were drawn. The first and
second drawn lines of a two line basic pattern were
coded level 2 and 1, respectively. The code for the four
lines of two basic patterns overlaid was 2-1-2-1,
respectively. The four lines of a composite pattern were
coded 3-1-2-1, respectively, on the assumption that the
composite consisted of two sub-chunks.

Experiment
The first two hypotheses were tested by using the
shapes domain described above. The third hypothesis
concerning learning was tested by comparing
performance over two successive sessions in which the
same patterns were learnt and reinforced. The fourth
hypothesis was tested by using two different drawing
interfaces – pen and paper drawing versus keyboard and
mouse driven on-screen computer drawing, henceforth
freehand and computer groups, respectively.
The participants were unpaid volunteers, 4 male and
4 female aged 30-45. Equal numbers were assigned to
the computer and freehand groups.

Motivating Observations and Hypotheses
The experiment reported below consists of two
experiments (taken together here for the sake of brevity
and coherence). The first was a pilot in which latency
and other measures were examined in an exploratory
manner. In graphs for various measures based on data
from each individual participant on a single task (i.e.,
raw un-aggregated data), it was noticed that certain
patterns of latencies appeared to be common and were
related to the participants’ induced chunks. Figure 2
illustrates the patterns found. Local maxima in latencies, peaks, tended to be associated with the first line of
basic and composite chunks. A peak was operationally
defined as any latency whose magnitude was at least
10% greater than the mean of the preceding and
following latencies. With new just learnt composite
chunks there were two peaks, matching the two subchunks, with the second peak being smaller. With old
composites that had been drawn many times, and so
learnt well, the second peak tended to disappear.
Although the patterns illustrated in Figure 2 were not
universal they were sufficiently frequent to suggest that
some temporal signature of chunks would be found by
analyzing latencies. In particular, we propose three
hypotheses: (H1) Peaks may be an effective way to
discriminate chunks. Are peaks better than fixed latency
thresholds for identifying chunk boundaries? (H2) Hierarchical chunk levels may be reflected in the absolute
magnitude of latencies. (H3) The learning of chunks
may be apparent in changes of latencies over time.
Further, (H4) if the temporal signature of perceptual
chunks is real then it should be apparent when different
drawing media are used. The purpose of the experiment
was to test these hypotheses.

The computer drawing used a specially written program
on a Macintosh G3 computer. To draw a line,
participants first used the keyboard to select the type of
line to be drawn (i.e. horizontal, vertical or diagonal) by
pressing a key. The line was then drawn using a
standard mouse dragging action, with the line "rubber
banding" between the endpoints.
The freehand drawing used a high spatial and
temporal resolution drawing tablet (Wacom UD tablet)
connected to a PC computer running a specially written
data capture and analysis program.
In both cases the computers recorded detailed spatial
and temporal data to enable the drawn patterns to be
identified and for the latencies to be found.

Procedure
Participants were tested individually and each
completed two sessions. The participants were given a
period of familiarization with the given drawing
apparatus. In session 1, in order to learn the patterns
participants completed drawings of several basic
patterns. This was followed by a further 6 drawings of
both and basic and composite patterns. In the session 2,
there were 18 drawings consisting of multiple patterns.
The stimuli were presented on printed sheets or by
verbal instructions.

Results
Peaks versus thresholds: H1 and H4
Consider first the overall distributions of latencies for
elements within chunks (level 1) and between chunks
(levels 2 and 3). For data aggregated over participants
in the same group and over all the tasks in each session,
Table 1 shows various measures for these distributions.
Between chunk latencies are greater than within chunk
latencies, across session and interface type. All the
distributions are skewed towards lower latency values.
This pattern is similar to that found in other domains
(e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973; Reitman, 1976; Egan and
Schwartz, 1979), so it is appropriate to analyze this

domain using thresholds to identify chunk boundaries.
As latency distributions were skewed, median latencies
rather than the mean latencies were used in the analysis.
As expected, the median latencies were shorter for
freehand drawing versus computer drawing because of
the extra decisions and motor actions required with the
computer drawing interface.

not, the correctness of each individual identification
was determined. The same was done for peaks. Hence,
the ‘quality’ (information transmission/channel
capacity) of each method was computed (Wickens,
1993). The ideal quality, for all participants across the
sessions, was almost unity because the numbers of
within and between chunk items were nearly equal.

As the number of chunks is defined by the stimuli set
an ‘optimum threshold’ can be set to distinguish chunk
boundaries on an individual participant and session
basis. The threshold is set so that the number of items
above the threshold equals the number of known chunk
items. Table 2 gives the thresholds found for each
participant. Note the differences across sessions and the
differences between individuals within sessions. As
would be expected, the threshold for free hand is
generally less than that for computer drawing.

How do peaks compare with the use of latency
thresholds as methods to discriminate chunks? Information theory (Wickens, 1993) provides a convenient
way to measure how well each method performs by
treating each as a system that is attempting to transmit
information about items within chunks and items at the
boundaries between chunks. By using conditional
probabilities, information theory takes into account not
only true positives and negatives (e.g., peak–>between
chunks, ~peak–> within chunk) but also false positives
and negatives (peak–>within chunk, ~peak–>between
chunks). Using the optimal thresholds given above and
the prior knowledge about which items were chunks or

Table 3 shows that for each participant in each
session under each drawing interface, the quality of the
discrimination with peaks was better than that using
fixed latency thresholds. Although there were just four
participants in each group, two-tail t tests were
performed to determine whether the peak method gave
a significantly higher quality of discrimination than the
threshold method. This was indeed the case for the
freehand drawing in sessions 1 and 2 (p=.005 and
p=.02, respectively) and computer drawing in session 2
(p=.018). For computer drawing in session 1 the
difference was approaching significance (p=.07).
The results demonstrate: (H1) that peaks are a more
effective way to discriminate chunk boundaries, and
(H4) the temporal signature of perceptual chunks is
apparent across different drawing media.

Chunking levels and learning: H2 & H3
Figures 3 and 4 show graphs of the median latencies
against different chunk levels for each drawing
interface and across each session. With one exception,
for every participant in each session with both drawing
interfaces, the median latencies increased with
increasing chunk level. Using Page’s test for ordered
median alternatives as applied to the different levels of
the chunk hierarchy (levels 1, 2, and 3) there was a
significant increasing trend in the latencies for the
computer drawing in both sessions; in both cases L=56,
p=.001 (n=4, k=3). Similarly for Freehand drawing in
session 1 L=56, p=.001 and session 2 L=55, p=.01
(n=4, k=3). The difference between the medians holds
not only at the group levels but also at an individual
level. Using the data for each participant, the Kruskal-

Wallis-H test was used to test whether the latency
distributions for the hierarchical levels were
significantly different. As shown in Table 4, the results
of the test for all participants were significant in both
sessions and regardless of the mode of drawing.
Comparing the graphs in Figures 3 and 4 across the two
sessions for each mode of drawing, it is clear that the
magnitudes of latencies drop. (Note that the latency
scale ranges differ.)
The results demonstrate: (H2) that the magnitude of
latencies reflect the hierarchical chunk level.

Table 5 presents median latencies for participants
using each mode of drawing for each chunk hierarchy
level and summarises the analysis. The latencies
decreased over sessions regardless of the hierarchical
level. The differences between participants performance
over the two sessions was assessed by applying the
Mann-Whitney U test (one-tailed); for the freehand
drawing group the decrease in median latencies is
significant at all chunk levels and for the computer

drawing group the decrease is significant at chunk
level-2 and level-3.
The results demonstrate: (H3) that the learning of
chunks is apparent in the changes of latencies over
time.

Discussion
A specially designed geometric shapes domain has been
used to study chunking behaviour in drawing.
Participants learnt named patterns that were assumed,
reasonably, to have been stored in memory as induced
perceptual chunks. The differences in the distributions
of recall latencies for elements within chunks and those
between chunks is similar to patterns of latency
distributions found in other domains (e.g., Chase and
Simon, 1973; Reitman, 1976; Frey, 1976; Egan and

Schwartz, 1979; Akin 1986; Ullman, 1990; Gobet,
1998). Similarly, optimal latency thresholds that could
be used to identify chunks were found to vary with
participants, depending on the nature of the drawing
interface and on the effect of learning.
It was discovered that peaks (local maxima in
latencies) were significantly better discriminators of
chunks than fixed thresholds. The contrast between the
approaches would be even starker, if, as would
normally be the case, the number of chunks was not
known a priori and used to set the optimal threshold.
Peaks have the advantage that they use only local
information about the relative magnitude of latencies to
discriminate chunks. Whether the peaks method
constitutes a general technique applicable beyond
drawing awaits further studies in other domains.
It was found that in drawing there was a strong
temporal signature of perceptual chunks in the
latencies. The level of an element in the chunk
hierarchy is reflected in the magnitude of the latency,
the higher the level the longer the pause. The effect is
sufficiently prominent to yield significant differences in
individual participant data. The effect of learning is also
evident in the changes in the absolute magnitude of
latencies at specific chunk levels. The changes to the
latencies appear to indicate when two chunks have been
compiled into a single composite chunk.
These effects were consistent over the different
modes of drawing, which suggests that the temporal
signature reflects the structure of chunks in memory,
and that the other processes of drawing, such as
planning, are organized on the basis of the chunk
structure. The process of drawing may magnify the
effect of chunk structure rather than diminish or distort
it. It seems plausible that the (sub) processes of drawing
may operate in a largely serial fashion. Latencies
between chunks may be longer than within chunk
latencies because they encompass more sub-processes.
Further work is addressing the robustness and
generalisability of the phenomena outlined in this
paper. The temporal signature of chunking has been
found to be apparent in other drawing domains, such as
diagrammatic representations for problem solving
(Lane, Cheng & Gobet, 2001).
