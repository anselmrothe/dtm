Abstract
We investigate deverbal noun and verb morphology in
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), using two masked priming
experiments in which the morphological, orthographic and
semantic relationship between prime and targets are varied in
four SOA conditions (32 ms, 48 ms, 64 ms, and 80 ms).
Results show that early in the visual processing of MSA
deverbal nouns and verbs, the role played by morphological
structure (word patterns and roots), is significantly different
from that played by orthographic and semantic factors.
Additionally, while word pattern effects are transient and
overlap with root morpheme effects only in the early stages of
processing, effects of the root are reliably present throughout
the recognition process.

Introduction
Unlike Indo-European languages where morphemic
units are linearly strung one after the other to create
new forms, Semitic languages like Modern Standard
Arabic (MSA), or Hebrew draw on a non-linear word
building principle whereby at least two abstract
morphemes are interlaced one within the other (Holes,
1995, Versteegh, 1997). Reflecting this, surface word
forms in such languages are traditionally analyzed into
word patterns and roots. Word patterns are CV
structures, primarily specifying vowels, that provide
phonological structure and convey syntactic meaning,
while roots consist solely of consonants and convey the
broad semantic properties of the surface form (Wright,
1995). For example, the word [katama] ‚Äúconceal‚Äù
comprises the word pattern {fa ala}1 with the syntactic
meaning ‚Äúperfective, active‚Äù, and the root {ktm}
meaning ‚Äúconcealing‚Äù. Both of these units recur many
times in the language in combination with other units.
The word pattern {fa ala} is met in other forms like
1

This is the conventional notation used to describe word
patterns, where the letters ‚Äúf, , l‚Äù are place holders
indicating where the first, second and third root letters go
when this unit is combined with a word pattern, and the
vowels (‚Äúa, a‚Äù here) indicate which vowels are inserted into
the surface CV template.

[sakaba] ‚Äúpour‚Äù, [daxala] ‚Äúenter‚Äù, [faqada] ‚Äúmiss‚Äù.
Likewise, the root {ktm} appears in such forms as
[kattama] ‚Äúcause to hide‚Äù, [kaatama] ‚Äúwithhold‚Äù, and
[takattama] ‚Äúkeep mum‚Äù.
Previous research on the use of word patterns and
roots during the processing of Hebrew and MSA has
yielded interesting, and largely consistent evidence that
these units are actively used during processing (Frost,
Forster & Deutsch, et al., 1997, Deutsch, Frost &
Forster, 1998, Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2000). For
instance, significant word pattern priming effects were
found in Hebrew and MSA, although limited to verb
morphology in Hebrew, but applying across syntactic
class categories in MSA (Deutsch, et al., 1998,
Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2000). Additionally,
reliable root priming was also found in Hebrew and
MSA nouns and verbs regardless of semantic
transparency (Frost et al., 1997, Boudelaa & MarslenWilson, 2000). This research into Semitic morphology
has provided some of the most compelling evidence in
favour of the view that the role played by
morphological structure in lexical processing and
representation is distinct from form and meaning
effects. Furthermore, the effects of word patterns and
roots clearly show that bound and indeed disrupted
morphemic units do influence processing.
Here we focus on MSA deverbal nouns and verbs
and try to go beyond the research reported so far to
examine how the prior presentation of a prime word
affects lexical decision to a target as a function of (a)
the relationship underlying prime and target, and (b)
prime display duration. As regards (a), we vary
morphological, orthographic and semantic relationships
between primes and targets such that the respective
contributions of each of these properties can be
examined. With respect to (b), we use four display
durations (or SOA‚Äôs), of 32, 48, 64, and 80 ms, to
assess the effects of priming across these dimensions of
similarity. In an earlier masked priming investigation of
Arabic morphology, we found reliable word pattern and
root priming effects at an SOA of 48 ms. Since both
morphemic units seem to be involved in the processing

at such an SOA, we decided to include a shorter SOA
of 32 ms, to determine whether word patterns and roots
have different processing onsets. We also included the
two longer SOA‚Äôs (64 and 80 ms) to monitor for the life
span of the priming likely to be generated by these
units. It should be stressed that at SOA‚Äôs of 32 ms and
48 ms, participants are not aware of the presence of a
prime at all, while at 64 and 80 ms, the presence of a
prime may be detectable, though never reliably enough
to be reported. This means that masked priming
performance is relatively insensitive to episodic and
strategic confounds. Furthermore, previous research
using this paradigm has shown it to be well suited to the
study of morphological and orthographic effects at
short SOA‚Äôs (Frost et al., 1997, Forster & Azuma,
2000), and to the investigation of semantic effects at
longer SOA‚Äôs (Perea et al., 1995, Sereno, 1991).
Accordingly, apart from minimizing strategic behavior,
our choice of a small range of incremental steps in
prime durations should allow us to track the dynamics
of processing events as they unfold over time, and in a
more fine-grained manner than earlier studies using this
technique (Rastle et al., 2000, Feldman, 2000). Our
hypothesis is that if morphological structure in MSA is
playing a role that is genuinely distinct from that played
by orthography and semantics, then this should be
reflected in the differential priming effects observed in
the morphological, orthographic and semantic
conditions across the four SOA‚Äôs. More specifically,
word pattern and root effects should be able to emerge
earlier than semantic effects, and should be stronger
than orthography-driven effects. Additionally, since
root morphemes convey semantic meaning, their effects
are predicted to be more long-lived than those of the
word patterns, which convey syntactic and
phonological information. These predictions are tested
in Experiment 1 and 2 using deverbal nouns and verbs
respectively.

Experiment 1
While sharing the same stock of root morphemes
with verbs, deverbal nouns draw on a specific set of
word patterns which distinguishes them not only from
verbs but also from the closed class of primitive nouns
(Bohas and Guillaume, 1984). The purpose of this
experiment is to investigate the time course of word
pattern and root effects as opposed to semantic and
form effects during the processing of deverbal nouns.
To do this we used masked priming with four primedisplay durations to assess priming between pairs of
deverbal nouns which share either a word pattern, a

root, or a non-structural orthographic or semantic
relationship.

Method
Participants
A group of 138 volunteers aged 16 to 20 took part in
the experiment. They were pupils at the high school of
Tataouine in South Tunisia, and used MSA on regular
basis.
Material
The prime and target pairs used fell into one of 6
conditions each of which comprised 24 pairs. In
Condition 1, which we will refer to as [+WP], the prime
and target share a word pattern (e.g., G|#BQJ#:
[xaalid]-[ aaris] ‚Äúeternal‚Äù-guardian‚Äù). To control for
the vocalic and consonantal overlap underlying the
prime and target pairs in condition 1, Condition 2,
[+Orth1] is an orthographic control condition matching
the form overlap (primarily in shared vowels) of the
word pattern pairs (e.g., ¬í*#;Nw¬ù` [sa aaba]-[t alaaq]
‚Äúcloud‚Äù-‚Äúdivorce‚Äù). In Condition 3, labeled [+R +S],
the prime and target pairs share a root morpheme and a
transparent semantic relationship (e.g., ¬íN#¬ñJP¬é¬ñJ
[ri aasa]-[ra iis] ‚Äúpresidency‚Äù-‚Äúpresident‚Äù). This is in
contrast to Condition 4, labeled [+R ‚ÄìS], where the
prime and target share a root but their semantic
relationship is opaque (e.g., `KR¬í`KR [ art ]-[ urt a]
‚Äúcondition‚Äù-‚Äúpolice‚Äù). Con-dition 5, labeled [+Orth 2],
is the orthographic control for the two conditions
sharing a root (e.g., 0*#2-"¬å2 [ aabit]-[ awaab]
‚Äúfirm‚Äù-‚Äúaward‚Äù). The difference from [+Orth1] is that
whereas the orthographic overlap in the latter relates to
the shared vowels between prime and target, here
overlap is specified solely in terms of shared
consonants. Since vowels are not normally written in
MSA (unless long), the form overlap in the [+Orth1]
pairs is orthographically implicit, but fully explicit in
the [+Orth2] pairs. Condition 6, [-R +S], consists of
semantically but not morphologically related pairs (e.g.,
#/t-K: [qitaal]-[ arb] ‚Äúfight‚Äù-‚Äúwar‚Äù). Each of the
related prime words was matched to an unrelated
control prime. A similar number of pseudo-word-word
pairs was constructed in such a way as to echo the form
overlap between the word-word pairs.
Design and Procedure
Two versions were constructed such that all the
targets appeared only once in each version, half

preceded by a related prime and half by an unrelated
prime. Each trial consisted of three visual events. The
first was a forward pattern mask, in the form of a
sequence of 28 vertical lines in a 30-point traditional
Arabic font size. The second event was a prime word
written without diacritics in the same font but at 24
points. Four SOA‚Äôs corresponding to a prime display
duration of 32, 48, 64 and 80 ms were used. The third
event was a target word or non-word written without
diacritics in a 34 point font size. The larger font size of
the target was used because MSA does not have the
lower-case upper-case distinction. The stimulus words
and non-words were written in the usual unvowelled
script. Thirty two participants were assigned to the first
SOA, forty to the second, thirty six to the third, and
thirty to the fourth SOA. Participants were asked to
make lexical decision about the target by pressing a
‚ÄúYES‚Äù or a ‚ÄúNO‚Äù key.

phonological structure but with quite different syntactic
meanings. For example, the pair F¬ãKt¬ãM¬É [quruud][nuzuul] (‚Äúmonkeys‚Äù-‚Äúgoing down‚Äù), share the
phonological structure of the word pattern, which is
CVCVVC in both, but diverge with respect to its
syntactic meaning. The word pattern has a ‚Äúplural‚Äù
meaning in [quruud], but a ‚Äúsingular deverbal noun‚Äù
meaning in [nuzuul]. When we compared priming
between deverbal nouns sharing both the syntactic
meaning and the phonological structure of the word
pattern with priming between nouns sharing only the
phonological structure of the word pattern, it was only
the former type of word pairs that yielded significant
priming. The word pattern priming in the present
experiment replicates our initial finding of reliable
facilitation between deverbal nouns sharing the
phonological as well as the syntactic meaning of the
word pattern.
Turning to the two root conditions, [+R+S] and [+RS], there was robust priming, at a constant level, across
all four SOA‚Äôs. In the [+Orth2] condition, where the
prime and target shared a form overlap that mimicked
the consonantal overlap in the root pairs, a facilitatory
effect emerges at SOA 80 ms.
Similarly, significant facilitation emerges only at
SOA 80 ms in the [-R+S] condition, where there is only
a semantic relationship between prime and target. It is
interesting to note that while the effects of morphology
(here word pattern and root effects) are clearly distinct
from orthographic and semantic effects at SOA‚Äôs 32, 48
and 64 ms, the distinction between morphology-based
and form-based and meaning-based effects dissipates at
SOA 80. As can be seen in Figure 1 above, at SOA 80
the facilitation observed in the [+R +S] and the [+R-S]
conditions is no longer different from that found in the
[+Orth2] or the [-R+S] conditions.
A further point relates to the differences in priming
between the two orthographic conditions. In [+Orth1],
where the form overlap between prime and target is
vowel-based, facilitation occurs only at the shortest
SOA. In [+Orth2] where form overlap is consonantal in
nature, significant priming takes place only at the
longest SOA.
These differential effects can be

Results and discussion
Figure 1 plots the amount of priming (target RT
when preceded by an unrelated prime minus target RT
when preceded by a related prime) across condition and
SOA.
Targets preceded by a prime with which they have a
common word pattern were significantly facilitated
only at SOA‚Äôs 48 and 64 ms. The orthographic control
for the word-pattern pairs [+Orth1] showed signs of
priming at SOA 32, but no effects at any later SOA‚Äôs,
indicating that the word-pattern effects at SOA 48 and
64 are unlikely to be form-based. Word pattern priming
in MSA deverbal nouns contrasts with the lack of word
pattern priming in Hebrew nouns (Frost et al., 1997).
This difference may be traced back to the differences
underlying the word pairs making up the [+WP]
condition in the present study and the Hebrew word
pairs used in the same condition by Frost at al., (1997).
In this study, as in our original study where we first
report word pattern priming in Arabic nominal forms,
we made a distinction between the syntactic meaning of
the word pattern and its phonological structure
(Boudelaa & Marslen-Wilson, 2000). Two surface
forms may have a word pattern with the same surface

understood in the light of the different functional
factors underlying word pattern and root priming ‚Äì
especially, as here, in the written modality, where
consonantal information dominates the overt
orthographic content of prime and target. The fact that
root priming has a more precocious time course than
word pattern priming suggests that the language
processor monitors for the root consonants in order to
access the meaning of the form at hand. Hence word
pairs having a non-structural consonantal overlap may
act as competitors early on in processing. Conversely,
the slightly later onset of word pattern priming suggests
that this unit comes into play once a root unit has been
converged on. Since a root unit should be successfully
extracted very quickly if meaning is to be accessed at
all, word pairs sharing vocalic overlap need not
compete with each other at the early stages of
processing, hence the priming observed in the [+Orth1]
condition.
In sum, the results of this experiment suggest that
morphological effects take precedence over form driven
and meaning driven effects. More importantly perhaps,
from the perspective of Semitic morphology, both word
pattern and root morphemes are actively used very early
in processing. However, the effects of word patterns are
rather transient yielding facilitation only over two
SOA‚Äôs, while the effects of the root are more durable
(Deutsch et al., 2000). Arguably the qualitative
difference underlying the effects of word patterns and
roots reflects the difference between the information
conveyed by these two units. Word patterns convey
information that is syntactic and phonological in nature
(Holes, 1995), whereas roots convey semantic
information. The more consistent effects of roots by
contrast to word patterns suggest that the information
conveyed by the root is critically used throughout
processing while that conveyed by the word pattern is
only transiently salient.

Experiment 2
As we noted earlier, a primary division in Arabic
morphology is between the sets of deverbal nouns and
the verbs themselves. While roots are the same across
deverbal nouns and verbs, word patterns are the unit
that distinguishes these two syntactic categories.
Accordingly, Experiment 2 was designed to ask three
questions: First, will word patterns have similar
transient priming effects in verbs as they do in nouns?
Second, will root morphemes yield the same consistent
priming effects in verbs? Third, are the effects of these

two morphological units distinct from the effects
produced by orthography and semantics?

Method
Participants
Another group of 108 participants from the same
age group and linguistic background as those in
Experiment 1 took part in this experiment.
Material and design
The design was analogous to that used in
Experiment1. The material consisted of prime and
target verb forms which made up 6 experimental
conditions with 24 pairs each. In Condition 1, [+WP],
the prime and target share a word pattern (e.g., LK:$n}*$
[ a raza]-[ abla a] ‚Äúobtain‚Äù-‚Äúinform‚Äù). Condition 2,
[+Orth 1], was an orthographic control for the form
overlap in condition 1 (e.g., ¬í¬Ñ7|Ky¬É$ [la natun][ ankara] ‚Äúcommittee‚Äù-‚Äúdeny‚Äù). In condition 3, [+R
+S], prime and target share a root morpheme and a
transparent semantic relationship (e.g., wK/:"wK:$
[ i taraqa]-[ a raqa] ‚Äúget burned‚Äù-‚Äúburn‚Äù), while in
condition 4, [+R ‚ÄìS], they share a root but have an
opaque semantic relationship (e.g., ¬ÇF#u.¬ÇGu.
[taqaadama]-[taqaddama] ‚Äúget old‚Äù-‚Äúprogress‚Äù). As in
Experiment 1, Condition 5, [+Orth 2], is the
orthographic control for conditions 3 and 4 (e.g., j}*~}*
[bala a]-[ballala] ‚Äúswallow‚Äù-‚Äúsoak‚Äù). Condition 6, [-R
+S], tests for purely semantic effects (e.g., u¬ç$ Gx%.
[ ayqana]-[ta akkada] ‚Äúascertain‚Äù-‚Äúmake sure‚Äù). Each
of the related primes, across the 6 conditions, was
matched as closely as possible to a control prime that
shared no relationship with the target. A similar number
of pseudo-word-word pairs was constructed in such a
way as to echo the form overlap between the wordword pairs.
Procedure
The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1.

Results and discussion
Figure 2 shows net priming effects for the six
experimental conditions across the four SOA‚Äôs.
The results are even more clear cut than for the
deverbal nouns. The effects of word pattern morphemes
is again strong but highly transient, yielding significant
priming at SOA 48 only. Its matched orthographic

control, [+Orth1] condition shows a marginal 12 ms
facilitation at SOA 32 ms but no effects thereafter,
suggesting that word pattern effects are genuine
morphological effects that are not amenable to a formbased account. As regards roots, significant priming
effects are observed across all four SOA‚Äôs in both the
[+R+S] and the [+R-S] conditions. Orthographic and
semantic effects, as illustrated by the [+Orth2] and the
[-R+S] conditions, again emerge only at SOA 80. This
confirms that root morpheme effects and form-driven
and meaning-driven effects have different time courses,
the latter two effects taking more time to build up.
These results suggest that in MSA, morphological
processing has a different locus from form-based and
meaning-based processing. Moreover, verb word
patterns, like deverbal noun word patterns, play a
highly significant, though transient role during
processing. Roots, by contrast, give rise to an evenly
distributed pattern of facilitation across SOA‚Äôs. The
different time courses of word pattern and root
processing observed in this experiment and in the
previous one, suggest that the language processor uses
the information conveyed by these two units in different
ways and at different points in the internal process of
linguistically interpreting a written form.

Conclusion
We have reported two experiments aimed at
assessing the time course of morphological,
orthographic and semantic effects. In so far as Semitic
languages are concerned, there are at least three ways in
which morphological effects can be said to be clearly
distinct from orthographic and semantic effects:
First, word pattern morphemes, which are non-semantic
in nature, yield significant priming, while their matched
orthographic controls either do not yield any priming at
all, as in Experiment 2, or do so much less reliably, as
in Experiment 1. Second, root morphemes play a role
irrespective of semantic transparency, with surface
forms giving rise to reliable and significant priming as
long as they share a morphemic unit. Third,
morphological effects occur prior to orthographic and
semantic effects and have a longer time-course - at least
as far as the root is concerned. In the context of Semitic
morphology, this is the first demonstration that word
pattern and root morphemes have overlapping but
different processing time courses. This state of affairs is
a direct consequence of the kind of information that
word patterns and roots convey. The reliable and longlived root priming effects reflect the fact that lexical
interpretation and integration of Arabic surface forms

relies primarily on this unit. The transient word pattern
priming effects point to the fact that this unit is the
focus of the lexical mapping process only in so far as a
consonantal root unit can be successfully extracted.
Evidence supporting this comes from the finding that
no word pattern priming is found with pseudowords
consisting of existing word patterns and a non-existing
root, while root priming is found in pseudo words
consisting of an illegal combination of an existing word
pattern and an existing root (Frost et al., 1997).
Functionally, the results point to the conclusion that
morphemic units that are non-linear and abstract are
able to govern lexical access and lexical representation.
Turning to the orthographic effects observed in this
study, it seems that in MSA, and arguably in other
Semitic languages as well, vowels and consonants have
a different status. This is clear from the differential
priming yielded by word patterns and consonants on the
one hand, and by the different loci of orthographic
priming in the [+Orth1] and [+Orth2] on the other.
Remember that when
orthographic overlap is defined in terms of shared
vowels across primes and targets as in the [+Orth1]
condition, facilitation is early and transient. By contrast,
when it is defined in terms of the consonants shared by
prime and
target as in the [+Orth2] condition,
facilitation is late and robust. Taken together, these
results suggest that proximity in the Arabic lexical
space is sensitive to similarity in vowels and to
similarity in consonants, and that early on in processing
lexical competition is initiated on the basis of the
consonantal component of the surface form but not its
vocalic component.
It is worth noting that in English, where the vowelconsonant distinction is not morphemic, and under
experimental conditions that are most similar to ours,
that is at 32 ms SOA (Feldman, 2000) and at 43 ms
(Rastle et al., 2000), no orthographic effects are
obtained. Nonetheless, overall orthographic effects in
English tend to be facilitatory early in processing and
inhibitory later on. In other words, English orthographic
priming is more in keeping with the priming profile we
observe in our [+Orth1] condition, and the mirror image
of what we observe in our [+Orth2] condition. The
emergence of relatively late form effects as evidenced
by the priming in [+Orth2] at SOA 80 can perhaps be
accommodated within a model where knowledge about
the semantic and formal attributes of the input, be they
phonological or orthographic, are at the same level in
the perceptual system and are computed in parallel,
rather than having the form computed prior to accessing
the lexicon (Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1998).

From the perspective of a general theory of
morphological processing and representation, the
current results put new constraints on how to account
for morphological effects. For example, while
connectionist models, as they now stand, may be able to
account for morphological priming in the absence of
synchronic semantic links between prime and target
(Plaut & Gonnerman, 2000), it is less clear how word
patterns, which are non-semantic units in essence,
would be predicted to generate priming within such a
framework. Nevertheless, it remains important to
persevere with models which offer explicit and
quantitative predictions about behavior.
