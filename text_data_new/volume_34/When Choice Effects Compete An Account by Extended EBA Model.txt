Abstract
X
A modified version of EBA is proposed to account for choice
set effects (similarity, attraction, and compromise) and their
interactions. The new model has ingredients of search-fordominance-structure theory and counter race model,
highlighting conflict resolution and deliberation in decision
making. Simulation results show that the model can reproduce
the choice set effects and predict the interactions between
them.

Common Aspects

The EBA Model Revisited
The elimination by aspects model (EBA, Tversky, 1972a,
b) is a classical and well-known model, which remains
attractive because it was one of early models that provided a
clear processing assumption for choices with mathematical
rigor. EBA model asserts that an aspect is probabilistically
selected and options that do not have this aspect are
discarded. (In this paper, attribute, aspect, and feature are
used interchangeably). Another aspect is then selected and
options that do not have the second aspect are discarded.
Proceeding in this way, the EBA process terminates when
only one option remains. Although EBA is a simple model
that does capture an important facet of decision making,
there are many empirical effects and theoretical notions that
the model cannot explain. This paper describes an updated
version of EBA model that can account for choice set
effects (e.g., similarity, attraction, and compromise effects)
and their interactions.
The paper consists of four parts: The first section briefly
reviews properties of EBA in view of theories and findings
after its proposal in 1972. In the second section, a modified
EBA called REGAL model is proposed (Shiina, 1994, for
an earlier version): the model incorporates the ideas of
dominance structuring and race model. In the third section,
a simulation study is presented that shows how the new
model explains choice set effects and their interactions by
producing probability topographies. Finally, implications
for further research on choice and decision making are
addressed.

Aspects that are common to all the alternatives (in
Figure 1a) should be ignored in EBA whereas there is
evidence that common aspects play an important role both
in decisions and choice satisfaction (Chernev, 1997). It
seems very unnatural, moreover, that we should
intentionally ignore the important features, common or not,
that come to mind. If we consider a version of EBA that
permits common aspect selection (Common aspect EBA or
CEBA), it can be proved that CEBA does not change choice
probabilities and can produce decision time predictions.
Suppose that T={X,Y,Z}, x  { ,  , , } , y  { ,  , ,  } ,
and z  { , , , } (Figure 1a) with the understanding that
  u( ) etc., where u() is a utility (value) function. In
binary case : T  {X , Y} , we have
EBA

P( X { X , Y })  (   ) / (       )
CEBA

CEBA

P( X  { X , Y })  (   ) / L  (    ) / L  P( X  { X , Y }),
where L            
CEBA

Solving the second expression for P( x  {x, y}) , we have
CEBA

P( X  { X , Y }) 

(   ) / L
(   ) / L

1  (    ) / L {L  (    )} / L
EBA

 (   ) / (       )  P( X { X , Y })

This equivalence also holds true for trinary or more
numerous choices and thus Tversky’s exclusion of common
features is well grounded. For example, in trinary case :
T  { X , Y , Z} ,

P( X  { X , Y , Z })  P( X  T ) 

we can derive a simple recursive formula:

Therefore when m   , we can derive an expression that is

P( X  T ) 

The generalization to n-option situation is straightforward,
which gives reason for the idea that common features are
processed but are indifferent to the final choice, and how the
CEAB interpretation produces decision time predictions,
because this interpretation yields a geometric distribution
which permits rough estimates of decision times.

Conjunction of Features and Dominance
It appears that EBA uses attributes one at a time. A
careful reading of the original paper reveals, however, that
an aspect can be an aggregate or conjunction of aspects. The
aspect  in Figure 1a, for example, may itself be a set of
sub-aspects {1 ,  2 ,  3} as in Figure 1b. In Figure 1, the
choice of  automatically leads to the choice of X. This
paper interprets this property as “X was chosen because X
dominated other options on  .” If   {1 ,  2 ,  3} , the
interpretation will be “X was chosen because X dominated
the other options on {1 ,  2 ,  3} ”.
Dominance or dominance structuring is another key
concept in the present paper. According to Montgomery &
Willen (1999, p.148), “the decision maker attempts to find a
dominance structure, that is, a cognitive structure in which
the to-be-chosen alternative dominates other alternatives on
relevant attributes.” It seems natural and promising to
interpret EBA within the framework of search for
dominance structuring (SDS) theory (Montgomery, 1989;
Montgomery & Willen, 1999).
Because SDS model asserts that dominance should be
established on a bundle of relevant attributes, a to-be-chosen
alternative should be dominant on the conjunction of
relevant attributes. A comparison of EBA and SDS in this
respect gives a novel perspective; EBA is a very limited
SDS in the sense that EBA process is a type of dominance
structuring based upon a single attribute or a bundle of
unique attributes. The key ideas linking EBA and SDS
models are that dominance structuring is performed on a
conjunction of attributes and the conjunctive set is sampled
from the total set of attributes and thus changes over time.
The conjunction of attributes is called an evaluation set or
an aspect lineup in the model to be presented. An evaluation
set is a set of attributes, so it is totally different from the
consideration set, which is a set of alternatives.

Reconsideration, Deliberation, and Deferral
Decision deferral and deliberation are two sides of the
same coin because, in both cases, the decision maker cannot
resolve decisional conflict at hand and thus deliberation
evolves over time. Whereas it is often said that there are no
widely accepted definition of conflict (Tversky & Shafir,

1992), we adopt the simple definition of Coombs and
Avrunin (1988, p.222) that conflict arises in “a situation in
which a choice must be made in the absence of dominance”.
It is often argued that EBA is suitable for relatively easy
everyday choices, but may lead to less than optimal
decisions. Janis and Mann (1977, p.32) pointed out, for
example, that the decision maker may run out of relevant
aspects and/or alternatives before reaching a decision, or
may end up taking an alternative that is inferior to those
eliminated.
If a pure EBA processing is used, it is almost inevitable
that we may arrive at a much inferior choice with some
probability. In that case, it will be very hard to justify both
the final outcome and the choice process leaving a strong
feeling of regret. We may start over, reconsidering
discarded attributes and alternatives, whereas the original
EBA does not have the mechanism to allow for such
reprocessing. It is obvious that we should deliberate when
the decision problem at hand is very important (buying
expensive items, choosing a spouse or a job, etc.).
Deliberation is a time-developing process and can continue
for months or even years, during which time we think about
the choice repeatedly. In this regard, an EBA model
reinforced by SDS seems very appealing, because
deliberation and justification are the key concepts of the
SDS theory. Further, the combination is consistent with the
current consensus that preferences are actively constructed,
not merely revealed (Bettman, Luce, & Payne, 1998).

Conflict Resolution and Counter Model
Tversky himself later maintained that decision making is
a type of conflict resolution and that justification for the
decision is necessary (Simonson, 1989; Simonson &
Tversky, 1992; Tversky & Shafir, 1992; Shafir, Simonson,
& Tversky, 1993). Dominance structuring is one method of
conflict resolution and, if successful, it makes the choice
self-evident (Montgomery & Willen, 1999, p.148).
Although there are easy decisions that can be made almost
automatically, decision makers facing an important decision
should repeat consideration. Therefore, a counter or race
model(Smith & Van Zandt, 2000) may be hypothesized in
which the confidence for each alternative is accumulated
during reconsideration, as the decision problem is addressed
from many perspectives over time. This reconsideration
process, possibly with repeated generation of evaluation set
by attribute sampling, would be necessary to make the
decision satisfactory or satisficting.

REGAL Model
The REGAL (REpeated-Generation of Aspect Lineup)
model integrates concepts from EBA, SDS, and the race
(counter) models and tries to extend EBA in the following
ways. First, reconsideration of aspects and alternatives is
allowed, as this is an undeniable aspect of real-world
decision-making. Second, REGAL permits the generation of
conjunctive aspects, because a decision maker often has a
bundle of minimum but unstable requirements that can be
represented by a fluctuating conjunction of aspects. Third,

2316

REGAL does not ignore aspects that are common to the
alternatives, because there is evidence that common aspects
do affect choice by enhancing the satisfaction. Finally, the
concepts of counter and criterion (threshold) are adopted
from race model to allow for decision time predictions.
In short, our revised EBA incorporates a) reconsideration
and deliberation processes, b) a more flexible aspect
selection that permits conjunctions, c) the processing of
common features, and d) decision time generation processes.

The Flow of the REGAL Model
The processing flow of the model is as follows (see also
Figure 2 and Appendix):
(1) Let T be the set of alternatives and  be the set of
attributes used to represent the alternatives. The set x  
is the feature representation of Alternative X.
(2) A decision maker probabilistically samples a set of
attributes  from  , called an evaluation set or an aspect
lineup. The evaluation set is repeatedly regenerated during
each cycle of REGAL process as shown schematically by
the loop from (6) back to (2) in Figure 2. The
reconsideration processes are represented in the loop.
(3) The degree of satisfaction for each alternative is
evaluated on the current evaluation set determined in (2).
The degree of satisfaction 0  S ( x)  1 is defined as
S ( x) =Goodness of Option X  Structural dominance of X

over the other alternatives on evaluation set  .

The “Goodness” part says when both the evaluation set and
X have many features and thus are rich then the function
tends to output a larger satisfaction value. The “Dominance
Part” outputs how dominant X is over the other alternatives
in the attribute structure induced by  .
(4) A decisional criterion  is assumed. If S ( x)  S ( y)  
for all Y T  {X } then X is in the state of decisional
dominance. If no option is dominant the process jumps to
(6). Decisional dominance means that an option dominates
the others in satisfaction at the moment.
(5) For each alternative, there is a confidence counter C(X).
If X becomes decisional dominant in (4), then a unit
increment is added to C(X). Race model is incorporated
around (5) and (6).
(6) If C(X) reaches a confidence criterion L, then X is
chosen else the process resumes from (2), where the
regeneration of evaluation set  is performed. The
confidence criterion or threshold L represents decision
quality: If the decision is momentous, L will be a high value,
whereas if the decision is less important, L will be smaller.
The depth of reconsideration processes are partially
moderated by L and thus a merit of REGAL is that it
encompasses the notion of decision quality.
When only one attribute is very important in decision,
EBA, SDS, and REGAL tend to produce the same final
choice.
Counter Model The loop between (6) and (2) constitutes a
counter model (Smith & Van Zandt, 2000). The exact
probability of choice is given in Appendix (Section 5).

Figure 2: Outline of REGAL Model
Relation to Previous Models Based on Manski (1977),
several researchers have proposed conjunction models to
make consideration sets (Andrews & Manrai, 1998; Gilbride
& Allenby, 2004, 2006). Subset Conjunction proposed by
Jedidi and Kohli (2005) is similar to the evaluation set in
this paper. REGAL does not make consideration sets
explicitly, but when y     alternative Y is virtually
excluded from the set of choice options and the remaining
alternatives form a temporal consideration set. The major
difference between REGAL and these previous models is
that the consideration set is always temporary in REGAL.

Simulation: Choice Set Effects
This section demonstrates how REGAL explains choice
set effects (Roe, Busemeyer, & Townsend, 2001) and their
interactions. Choice set effects have been studied on 2dimensional continuous attribute spaces (Figure 3). Suppose

2317

which is sub-additive (Rottenstreich & Tversky, 1997) in
the sense that P( )  P(1 )  P( 2 ) when   {1 ,  2 } .
Value Function and Satisfaction Function The value
(utility) of feature  is again assumed to be a function of the
length of feature :
v( )  K 2  log(length( )) K2:constant.
Using this function, the original binary version of
satisfaction function (Equation (A.2) in Appendix) is
converted into a continuous dimensional version:

ATTRIBUTE 2

there are two options : A and B. Choice set effects
(Similarity, Attraction, and Compromise effects) occur as a
function of the location of new option C.
Both EBA and REGAL prefer discrete features and thus
a special arrangement is needed to deal with continuous
dimensions (See, Gensch & Ghose, 1992 for another
approach). Basically, the continuous dimension is divided
into segments and each segment is reinterpreted as a feature.
For example, let A’={} and B’={} before the
placement of C. If we place a new option C1, the definition
of segments and thus the features are changed accordingly
(Figure 3) : A’={}, B’={}, and
C’={in this particular case.
The Probability of Choosing a Feature Let P( ),  be
the probability that feature  is included in  . P( ) is a
function of feature importance or salience. In the present
simulation, the length of feature would represent the
salience, so that it is simply assumed :
P( )  1  exp(length( )  K1 ) K1:constant

Interactions of Choice Set Effects Suppose that new
Option C is placed at C1. Attraction effect predicts P(A) will
be larger while Similarity effect predicts P(A) will be
smaller. If C is place at C2, Similarity effect predicts P(A)
smaller while Compromise effect predicts P(A) will be
larger. If C is placed at C3, P(A) may become larger because
C is dominated by both A and B but more strongly
dominated by A than B, and there may be a slight similarity
effect between C and B as well.
Apparently, in these cases choice set effects compete or
collaborate and the choice probabilities should be
determined as a non-linear function of forces that try to push
up or down probabilities. In choice effect studies, pure
conditions in which the effect of a single force becomes
observable have been used. A next challenge should be to
clarify the joint effects of choice set effects and the present
study is the first such attempt.

RESULTS
By moving Option C on the space (Figure 3), we can
observe how the probabilities for Options A, B, and C
change. REGAL can probe the joint effects by generating
probability topographies (Figures 4, 5, and 6) calculated
from Equation (A.3) in Appendix. Several detailed values
for parameters are also shown in Appendix.

Figures 4a (bird's eye view) and 4b (contour map) show the
same topographic probability information. The probabilities
are theoretical predictions in an ideal space
The reading of Figure 4a and 4b is a little confusing: they
are showing P(A), the probability that Option A will be
chosen, as a function of C location. Therefore, the right
lower high region, for example, should be read that “if you
place C around here, P(A) will be high.” Figures 5a and 5b
show P(C) as a function of C location. In this case, the
figures give a natural interpretation. The graph for P(B) is
omitted because it is an exact mirror image of Figure 4.
Major observations are as follows. 1) Strikingly high
P(C) is obtained when C strongly dominates A and B
(Figure 5b, upper right) and very low P(C) when C is
dominated by both A and B. 2) Similarity effect is stronger
than attraction effect (Figure 4b) and compromise effect is
very weak (Figure 5b). Attraction effect was weak possibly
because attraction and similarity effects compete in Figure
4b. 3) Increasing L made large probabilities larger and small
probabilities smaller. As a result, the slope in Figure 6
became steeper. Psychologically, this would mean that
deeper deliberation changes probabilistic choice into
something akin to logical judgment, decreasing the chance
of taking inferior options. Of course, these observations
depend upon the present configuration of options,
definitions of features, the shape of the value function, and
the parameter values. More intensive search is needed to
validate the model. Due to space limitation, RT predictions
will be presented elsewhere.

Discussion

Figure 5b: P(C) as a function of C location

It is well-known that MDFT model (Roe, et.al, 2001) and
LCA model (Usher & McClelland, 2001) are able to mimic
the three choice set effects. The present model is distinct
both in architecture and in processing assumptions and can
deal with, at least in theory, any number of options and
attributes. Further, it can produce predictions for choice
probabilities and decision times. This paper showed only
qualitative validity of REGAL in an ideal theoretical space
and empirical tests will be necessary in the future study.

value in [0,1] : the value of 1 is obtained when x     ,
that is, alternative X is perfectly dominating the other
alternative in the sense it has all relevant attributes, and the
value 0 is obtained when x     , that is, X has no
relevant attributes under the current evaluation set.
Dominance part represents the structural dominance of X
over the other alternatives. This part also takes a value in [0,
1]: the value of 1 is obtained when x   and y     for
all Y except X, that is, alternative X is perfectly dominating
the other alternative with respect to the current evaluation
set, and the value of 0 is obtained when x    y     ,
that is, X is totally dominated by the other alternatives under
the current evaluation set.
(4) Probability of decisional dominance The probability
that Alternative X becomes dominant, M X , is defined as

where  N ( ,  ) :Decisional criterion that may fluctuate.
In the text, the variance is set to 0 and thus  is a constant.
(5) Confidence counter C( ). The loop between (6) and (2)
in Figure 2 can be captured by a race model and an
alternative that first reaches L is chosen, where L is a
confidence criterion. From the standard result of Poisson
counter model (Smith and Van Zandt, 2000), the final
choice probability is given in closed-form by:

where n is the number of attributes and k ’s are Poisson
strength parameters. Without loss of generality, we can set
k  M k . The free parameters are L,  ,  2 and P( ),   .
By adjusting them, we can examine whether REGAL can
mimic the three choice-set effects. In the simulation,
L  5,   0 , and  2  0 were used.
