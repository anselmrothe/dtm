rehearsals of primacy items (e.g., Rundus, 1971). However,
some data indicate that part of the recall enhancement for
the first item (at least when it is also the first item retrieved)
cannot be explained by rehearsal frequency (e.g., Howard &
Kahana, 2002). The first item is also at a unique list position
that may make this item stand out. Therefore, the
distinctiveness of the first item may contribute to its greater
probability of recall success (e.g., Brown, Neath & Chater,
2007).
One
difficulty
in
testing
distinctiveness-based
explanations of behavioral phenomena lies in the fact that
“distinctiveness” refers to a subjective experience rather
than a physical property of an object (Hunt, 2006).
Therefore, it is essential to find a measure of distinctiveness
that is independent of the enhanced recall. To this end, a
neural index of perceived distinctiveness is the P300
component of the ERP (Sutton, Braren, Zubrin & John,
1965), which peaks between 300 and 700 ms after the
presentation of stimuli that are rare, unexpected, as well as
task-relevant (for a review see Donchin, 1981). The context
updating model (Donchin, 1981; Donchin & Coles, 1988)
associates P300 amplitude with the degree to which novel
information conflicts with expectations derived from a
mental schema; information thus registered as unexpected,
or distinctive, is then incorporated to update the schema.
Since this process occurs interactively with information in
long-term memory, this theory closely relates the P300 to
memory processes.
To the extent that P300 indexes distinctiveness, the results
of Ritter, Vaughan and Costa (1968) support the idea that
stimuli at the beginning of a sequence are distinctive when
their onset is unpredictable. They showed that, in addition to
physically deviant stimuli, only the first stimulus in a
monotonous sequence elicited a P300. By contrast, the
second stimulus and all subsequent stimuli that did not stand
out from the sequence, did not elicit a P300.
Items that stand out from their study list are more likely to
be recalled than non-distinctive items (Von Restorff, 1933).
Several studies have shown that when participants use rote
rehearsal, physically distinctive words that elicit larger P300
amplitudes are more likely to be recalled on a later free
recall test (Fabiani & Donchin, 1995; Fabiani et al. 1990;
Karis et al. 1984; Otten & Donchin, 2000). Since the
variance in P300 amplitude and the variance in recall

Abstract
The primacy effect in free recall is commonly attributed to
more frequent rehearsals for stimuli in the first few serial
positions. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we
investigated whether the first list position also provides a
distinctive feature to the stimulus, which enhances its
encoding and aids retrieval on a recall test. The amplitude of
the P300 elicited by stimuli that deviate physically or
semantically from their context has previously been shown to
correlate with the probability of later recall when participants
use rote rehearsal. We reasoned that if the temporal
distinctiveness of the first item in a list contributes to its
enhanced recall, such a P300 subsequent memory effect
should be present for this item as well. Participants studied
and immediately recalled lists of 15 words including one
physically deviant “isolate” while their EEG was recorded.
We quantified P300 amplitude by a principal component
analysis, and applied a correction for inter-trial latency jitter.
The first words in a list and isolates were better recalled than
regular words in the middle list positions, and the P300
elicited by these words was correlated with subsequent recall.
Regular words in the middle list positions, as well as words in
the second list position, did not show such a P300 subsequent
memory effect. These results support a distinctiveness-based
explanation of the primacy effect in free recall.
Keywords: Primacy effect; event-related potentials; free
recall; P300; subsequent memory effect.

Introduction
We tested the hypothesis that items in the first serial
position of a study list are distinctive, which accounts for
the primacy effect in free recall. We used the P300 eventrelated potential (ERP) as an index of distinctiveness. Prior
studies have shown that under rote rehearsal the amplitude
of the P300 elicited by physically or semantically deviant
study items is correlated with later recall success (Fabiani &
Donchin, 1995; Fabiani, Karis & Donchin, 1990; Karis,
Fabiani & Donchin, 1984). We investigated whether this
same effect is also observed for the first list item, which
would support a distinctiveness-based explanation of the
primacy effect in free recall.
The term “primacy effect” refers to the increased
probability of free recall of the first few, compared to the
middle items within a study list. The most influential
explanation for this effect attributes it to more frequent

probability are correlated, the enhancing effects of
distinctiveness on recall can be indexed by this correlation.
The design used in these studies, as well as in the present
study, is known as the subsequent memory paradigm.
Participants view several study items while their brain
activity is recorded and later complete a memory test. Then,
their brain activity is sorted according to the degree to
which items were subsequently remembered (the subsequent
memory effect, for a review see Paller & Wagner, 2002).
Previous studies examining primacy subsequent memory
effects using the P300 have yielded inconsistent results.
Azizian and Polich (2007) reported that P300 amplitude
elicited by words in the initial list positions was correlated
with recall; however the authors collapsed ERPs across the
first three list positions – a disadvantage from the standpoint
of our hypothesis that P300 amplitude will be correlated
with recall only for position 1. By contrast, Wiswede,
Ruesseler and Muente (2007) reported that although the first
word elicited a P300, there was a P300 subsequent memory
effect only for the final study words. A problem with this
study is that only 11 out of 18 participants showed a
primacy effect; a subsequent memory effect may have been
obtained if the behavioral effect was more reliable. A third
study found only a small primacy effect and no P300
subsequent memory effects for either primacy or recency
positions (Rushby, Barry & Johnstone, 2002). This study,
however, averaged over 5 consecutive list positions, again
preventing conclusions about the first item only.
All three studies ignored the possibility that P300 latency
may have varied between trials and participants - as their
broad ERP waveforms suggest. Since such latency jitter can
reduce average ERP amplitudes, a correction allows for
more meaningful comparisons between conditions (e.g.,
Spencer, Abad, & Donchin, 2000). A further shortcoming is
that all studies used mean- or peak amplitude measures to
quantify the P300, which are not able to disentangle
overlapping ERP components. Finally, no study included a
manipulation known to elicit a P300, such as the isolation of
a word by its font size; such a manipulation would allow for
a direct comparison of subsequent memory effects for the
first list position and isolates.
Some support for the idea that primacy items may show a
P300 subsequent memory effect comes from an fMRI study
in which the first list items elicited stronger activity in brain
areas known to generate the P300 (the temporoparietal
junction) when these words were later successfully retrieved
in an associative recall test (Sommer, et al., 2006).
However, fMRI has a lower temporal resolution than ERPs
and the design differed from typical free recall studies, so
our distinctiveness hypothesis remains to be tested.
We addressed the shortcomings of the prior ERP studies
by including a physical “isolate” in each list, by applying a
principal component analysis (PCA), and by correcting for
latency jitter. We hypothesized that, similar to the isolates,
words in list position 1 are distinctive and therefore elicit a
P300, which will be larger for those words that are later
successfully recalled, compared to forgotten items.

Methods
For this study we combined data from two experiments,
each employing 20 critical lists (i.e., lists of interest for the
present analysis) randomly interspersed with other list types.
Each list was presented as part of a study-recall sequence.
Critical lists consisted of 15 words, including one physically
deviant word (see below). In one study, lists that varied in
word frequency (n=23) were randomly interspersed with the
critical lists; in the other study, word lists of varied
emotional content were employed (n=22). Here, we only
report data from the critical list type. A comparison of the
recall- and ERP data ensured that there were no differences
between the samples.
Participants. Fourty five college students participated in
exchange for course credit (n=33) or $7 per hour (n=12).
The data from 14 participants were excluded from the
analysis due to excessive artifacts in their EEG1, and one
participant was excluded due to non-compliance with the
instructions. The remaining 22 female and 8 male
participants were between 18 and 45 years old (M=22.57).
All participants gave written informed consent, and all
procedures were approved by the institutional review board.
Stimuli. Each study list contained 15 words, presented one
at a time in white 16 pt font of Arial Unicode style, on a
black screen. Stimuli included emotionally neutral nouns,
verbs and adjectives with a word frequency of 11-50 per
million according to Francis & Kucera (1982), and were
between 3 and 8 letters long. The composition of each list
and the order of words within a list were randomized, and
no word was presented to the same participant twice. Words
were presented for 250ms, followed by a fixation cross for
2s. Each critical list contained an “isolate” in a larger font
size (24 pt), which was randomly placed between serial
positions 6 and 10. After the last word of each list, a grey
triangle appeared indicating the start of the recall phase.
Procedure. The experiment consisted of two sessions, each
up to 2 1/2 hours long. Over the course of the two sessions,
participants studied a total of 70 (exp 1) or 80 (exp 2) word
lists, including 20 critical lists. The first session also
contained 2 practice lists. After the preparations for the EEG
recording, participants were seated at a distance of 60cm
from the computer screen and instructed to memorize the
words using rote rehearsal. After each list, participants
wrote down every word they remembered in any order.
Recall lasted at least 45s, but participants were allowed to
write down words for as long as they wished. Participants
initiated the start of the next list with a button press and
breaks were allowed after sets of 4 lists. After the second
session participants were debriefed about their encoding
strategies.

The high number of participants excluded due to artifacts was
due to frequent movement artifacts at the beginning of the lists,
possibly because participants were still getting comfortable.

EEG Recording and Analysis. The EEG was recorded
with a 128 channel Electrical Geodesics, Inc. (EGI) system,
digitized with a sampling rate of 250 Hz and referenced to
electrode Cz. For all off-line analysis we used NetStation
(EGI) software, the EEGlab toolbox (Delorme & Makeig,
2004), J. Dien’s EP toolkit (Dien, 2010), as well as selfwritten MATLAB scripts. The data were low-pass filtered
at 20 Hz and segmented into epochs of 400 ms before to
2000 ms after word onset. Segments were corrected for eye
blink artifacts using independent component analysis.
Segments still containing artifacts were excluded and the
data were mathematically re-referenced to linked mastoids
and baseline corrected for a time window of 400 ms before
the stimulus. We computed ERPs separately for regular
words in serial positions 6-10 (henceforth referred to as
“standards”), words in a larger font size (“isolates”), and for
words in serial positions 1, 2, and 3.

and an average of 4.8 and 4.6 trials for the recalled- and not
recalled words in positions 1 and 2, respectively.
Finally, we quantified P300 amplitude by applying a
temporal PCA on the jitter-corrected virtual ERPs to obtain
a single factor score for each participant, word type, and for
recalled and not recalled words. In the temporal PCA we
rotated 15 factors with the Promax technique.
Statistical Analysis. Since the data violated the assumption
of sphericity necessary for repeated measures ANOVA, we
conducted a MANOVA on the recall rates for words in
position 1, standards and isolates; as well as a 2x4
MANOVA on the P300 amplitudes (as quantified by the
factor scores) testing for differences between word types
(isolates, standards, position 1 and position 2), and recalled
and not recalled words. Words from position 3 were not
included in the statistical analysis since the ERPs showed
the same pattern as position 2, and since one participant had
no artifact-free trials for the “position 3/recalled” category.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To quantify ERP
amplitudes, we conducted a spatio-temporal PCA (Spencer,
Dien & Donchin, 1999). This approach has been widely
used as temporal PCA (Donchin, 1966; Donchin & Heffley,
1978) in the analysis of ERP data. With the advent of dense
electrode array EEG recordings, spatial PCA was developed
to identify ERP component’s spatial distributions (Spencer,
Dien & Donchin, 1999); this is then followed by a temporal
PCA to identify time courses. The PCA approach allows
parsing of the ERP into components and yields measures of
component amplitudes (factor scores) that can be used for
testing hypotheses.
Submitted to the PCA were the ERP averages of isolates,
standards (list positions 6-10), and words in positions 1, 2,
and 3. We rotated 15 factors, as identified by a scree test
(Cattell, 1966), using the Promax rotation method (e.g.,
Dien, Beal & Berg, 2005). The factor score coefficients of
the PCA factor corresponding to the P300 were then applied
to each EEG trial to calculate “virtual ERPs” (factor scores
plotted across the time points; Spencer et al., 1999).
Since the broad peaks of the virtual ERPs indicated that
P300 latency varied between trials, they were corrected for
latency-jitter using a cross-correlation technique (see
Gratton, Kramer, Coles & Donchin, 1989, for a review of
this and other jitter correction techniques). The grand
average P300 virtual ERP was used as a template, which
was cross-correlated with every trial. The point of maximal
cross correlation was then used to determine a lag to shift
this trial, with the restriction that the P300 peak had to lie
within 450 and 750ms after word onset. Each trial was
baseline corrected again for 200ms, and the average over the
latency corrected trials was computed for each word type
and recalled and not recalled words. Since isolates and
words in positions 1-2 had low trial numbers and since the
number of trials included in an ERP average can affect ERP
amplitudes, we matched the recalled and not recalled
categories for trial number by randomly selecting the same
number of trials. This resulted in an average of 5 trials
contributing to the recalled- and the not recalled isolates,

Results
Behavioral Data. The debriefing confirmed that most
participants had used a rote memorization strategy. This was
supported by the serial position curve (figure 1),which
showed the typical shape, with a primacy effect for the first
three to four serial positions and a recency effect over the
last five serial positions.
Recall rates differed between words at serial position 1,
isolates, and standards [Wilk’s Lambda=.14, F(2,28)=87.07,
p<.01]. Paired samples t-tests showed that recall for words
in list position 1 was superior to recall for both standards,
t(29)=8.46, p<.01, and isolates, t(29)=2.41, p<.05, while
isolates were recalled with a higher probability than
standards, t(29)=8.18, p<.01. All but 4 participants showed
superior recall for words in position 1 and all but 3
participants (a different set then the aforementioned 4)
showed superior recall for isolates, compared to standards.

isolates is averaged across positions 6-10.
Event-Related Potentials. The spatial PCA solution
accounted for a total of 85% of the variance in the data.
Based on its parietal distribution, the fourth spatial factor
was identified as the P300. Figure 2a displays the loadings
of this factor, which accounted for 7% of the total variance.

Figure 2b shows the raw virtual ERPs of the P300 factor
by word type and subsequent recall. The P300 peaked
between 500 and 700 ms after word onset. The broad peaks
for isolates and words in position 1 strongly suggest the
presence of latency jitter. The latency jitter corrected virtual
ERPs are displayed in figure 2c. A comparison of figures 2b
and 2c indicates that the jitter correction was successful,
producing narrower peaks and higher amplitudes. Note that
it is not unusual that even standards and words in position 2
now exhibit a small positivity, since the algorithm picks the
point of maximal cross-correlation, and thus tends to bias
the jitter-corrected average towards the template. It is also
important to note that the direction of the difference
between recalled and not recalled words was not changed by
the jitter correction for any word type.
The second temporal factor, which accounted for 14% of
the variance of the P300 virtual ERPs, lined up with the
P300 peak and was therefore identified as the temporal P300
factor. Temporal factor loadings are displayed in figure 2c.
Figure 2d shows the mean spatio-temporal factor scores, as
a measure of P300 amplitude, for the four word types and
for recalled and not recalled words.
The 2x4 MANOVA revealed that P300 amplitude
differed between later recalled and not recalled items,
Wilk’s Lambda=.66, F(1,29)=14.77, p<.01, which was
qualified by an interaction between word type and recall
success, Wilk’s Lambda=.64, F(3,27)=4.98, p<.01. There
was no main effect for word type, Wilk’s Lambda=.93,
F(3,27)=63, ns. Critically, subsequent paired samples ttests revealed a significant difference in P300 amplitude
between recalled and not recalled words for isolates,
t(29)=2.28, p<.05, and words in position 1, t(29)=3.09,
p<.01, but not for standards, t(29)=1.21, ns, or words in
position 2, t(29)=-.8, ns.1
To test whether overall, isolates and words in position 1
elicited a larger P300 than the other word types, we
conducted planned comparisons between the combined
P300 amplitude values of isolates and position 1; and the
combination of standards and position 2, separately for
recalled and not recalled words. Although for both recalled
and not recalled words, isolates and words in position 1
elicited larger P300 amplitudes than the other word types,
the difference only reached significance for the recalled
words, t(29)=2.7, p<.05.

was evident for items in the first list position. Words in the
middle- and the second list positions, by contrast, did not
show this pattern. Since the P300 subsequent memory effect
indexes the enhancing effects of item distinctiveness on
recall, our results support the hypothesis that the first serial
position provides a distinctive feature to the stimulus, thus
enhancing encoding and aiding later retrieval.
Although Azizian and Polich (2007) reported a P300
subsequent memory effect for the first list positions, our
study provides stronger support for the distinctiveness
hypothesis of the primacy effect. First, our data indicate that
the P300 subsequent memory effect is only present for the
first word, suggesting that temporal distinctiveness does not
extend to later serial positions. Second, by using PCA we
were able to disentangle the P300 from other overlapping
components. Furthermore, our latency-jitter correction
insured that (1) differences between item types were not due
to differences in P300 latency variability and (2) any true
differences were not obscured by latency jitter, as may have
been true in Wiswede et al. (2007) and Rushby et al. (2002).
Finally, we were able to directly compare the subsequent
memory effects for physical isolates and words in position
1, and these showed remarkable similarities (figure 2c).
Our distinctiveness explanation does not contradict the
well-supported idea that rehearsal frequency accounts for
the primacy effect (e.g., Rundus, 1971). Indeed, items at the
first list position showed higher recall than the isolates,
suggesting that item distinctiveness may not be the only
factor enhancing recall of the first item. Recall was also
enhanced for positions 2 and 3 (figure 1), which did not
show a P300 subsequent memory effect. Therefore, we
suggest that the temporal distinctiveness of the first item
adds to the recall advantage by enhancing encoding and/or
providing a distinctive retrieval cue. Further studies are
necessary to investigate whether the effects of rehearsal
frequency and distinctiveness are additive or synergistic.
Note that the P300 only indexes distinctiveness to the
extent that the participant registers the distinctive feature at
the time of stimulus encounter. It cannot index other
conceptualizations of distinctiveness, such as distinctiveness
of the first item due to the relatively early output position
during recall (cf., Brown et al., 2007).
We did not have enough trials in the “position 15/not
recalled” category to conduct a subsequent memory analysis
for the recency positions. However, the last list item may
also be perceived as distinctive, and therefore future studies
should focus on such an analysis. Finally, an analysis of the
relationship between individual differences in P300
amplitude and the behavioral effects was beyond the scope
of this paper, but will be investigated in the future.
In conclusion, our study provides psychophysiological
evidence for the hypothesis that the primacy effect in free
recall is in part due to the enhancing effect of the first item’s
distinctiveness on recall. Our analysis focused only on the
P300, but future studies will also be focused on the
interaction of serial position effects with frontal slow wave
subsequent memory effects, which are thought to index

Discussion
We found a correlation of P300 amplitude with subsequent
recall for isolates, replicating prior studies (e.g., Karis et al.,
1984). Critically, the analogous subsequent memory effect

A supplementary analysis on the mean amplitudes of the
raw ERPs between 500 to 700 ms at two parietal electrodes
revealed the same patterns of results, with the exception that
the subsequent memory effect for position 1 only
approached significance (p=.11). This may be due a
decreased power for this comparison due to latency jitter.
