Abstract

intentions to forgive accidents (Grant et al, 2005). In a recent
study, Moran et al. (2011) found that high-functioning adults
with ASD show the same pattern, delivering less forgiveness
and more blame for accidents than neurotypical (NT) adults.
These findings suggest that the RTPJ should encode the
difference between accidental and intentional harm.
Puzzlingly, however, we find that the average mean signal – a
standard way of measuring neural involvement in a task – in
RTPJ and the other theory of mind regions is not different for
intentional versus accidental harmful actions in NT
participants. One possibility is that this key dimension can be
detected, not in the magnitude of response across a brain
region, but in the pattern of responses across voxels.
A complementary approach to traditional neuroimaging
analyses (which rely on average response magnitude) is to
look at the pattern of activity across voxels within a region,
using a technique called multi-voxel pattern analysis. If a
different tasks, stimulus categories, or stimulus features are
processed by (partially) different subpopulations of neurons
within a brain region, the difference may not be detectable in
the region’s average response, but may nevertheless produce
systematic and distinct patterns of activity across neighboring
voxels within the region (Normal et al, 2006; Haynes et al,
2006; Kriegeskorte & Bandetti, 2007). A key advantage of
this technique is that these patterns can be used to ‘decode’
information from the neural response not otherwise detectable
in the overall magnitude (e.g., object category in ventral
temporal regions, Haxby et al 2001). Thus MVPA can reveal
how stimulus categories are processed within a functional
region (Peelen et al, 2006; Haynes & Rees, 2006).
Given the importance of intentions for moral judgments of
accidental and intentional harms, we predicted that one or
more brain regions in the ToM network would explicitly
encode this feature of others’ mental states, in neurotypical
(NT) adults. That is, we predicted that (i) while participants
read about a wide range of harmful acts, we would be able to
decode whether the described harm was intentional or
accidental based on the spatial pattern of activity within ToM
brain regions. We tested this prediction in three experiments.
We also investigated (ii) whether the robustness of the spatial
pattern information within individuals would predict those
individuals’ moral judgments, and (iii) whether highfunctioning adults with ASD, who make atypical moral
judgments of accidental harms, would show correspondingly
atypical patterns of neural activity.

Intentional harms are typically judged to be less forgivable
than accidental harms. This difference depends on mental
state reasoning (i.e., reasoning about beliefs and intentions),
supported by a group of brain regions, the ‘theory of mind’
network. Prior research has found that (i) interfering with
activity in this network can shift moral judgments away from
reliance on mental state information, and (ii) high-functioning
individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) rely
significantly less on mental state information to make moral
judgments than matched neurotypical (NT) participants.
Across three experiments, we find using multi-voxel pattern
analysis (MVPA) that, in NT adults, (i) one key region of the
ToM network, the RTPJ, shows reliable and distinct spatial
patterns of responses across voxels for intentional versus
accidental harms, and (ii) individual differences in this neural
pattern predict individual differences in moral judgment. By
contrast, (iii) in ASD adults, the difference between
intentional and accidental harms is not encoded in the voxelwise pattern in the RTPJ or any other region, and (iv) higher
symptom severity scores are predictive of diminished pattern
discriminability. We conclude that MVPA can detect features
of mental state representations and that these features are
behaviorally and clinically relevant.

Introduction
Intentional harms are usually judged to be morally worse than
the same harms caused by accident (Cushman, 2008; Knobe,
2005; Malle & Knobe, 1997; Piaget, 1965; Singer et al, 2004;
Young & Saxe, 2011). The capacity to distinguish between
intentional and accidental harms depends on the capacity to
represent another person’s mental states, a cognitive function
associated with a specific and selective group of brain regions
(the ‘theory of mind network’). Prior research has revealed
that moral judgments of harmful actions depend on one
region in particular, the right temporo-parietal junction
(RTPJ). For example, individual differences in moral
judgments of accidental harms are correlated with RTPJ
activity (Young & Saxe, 2009), and disrupting RTPJ activity
interferes with these judgments (Young et al, 2010).
Recent evidence suggests that moral judgments may
provide a sensitive measure of enduring impairments in ToM
in high-functioning individuals with Autism Spectrum
Disorders (ASD). Children with ASD are disproportionately
impaired on tasks that require them to consider the beliefs and
intentions of other people (Peterson et al, 2005; Baron-Cohen,
1995). Although children with ASD distinguish between
moral and conventional transgressions (Blair et al, 1996), and
between good actions and bad actions (Leslie et al, 2006),
they are delayed in using information about innocent

Methods
Participants
Experiment 1: Sixteen right-handed members of the MIT
community (aged 18-50, 7 women). Experiment 2: Eighteen

right-handed college undergraduate students (aged 18-25
years, 8 women). Experiment 3: Fourteen right-handed
college undergraduate students (aged 18-25 years, 8 women).

Foreshadow (6s, only in Experiment 2), 3. Intent: Good
(Accidental Harm) or Bad (Intentional Harm) (6 s), 4.
Outcome (6s). Half of the stories in each run were presented
with foreshadow before intent; the order was reversed in the
other half. After each story, participants made moral
judgments of the action on a 3-point scale, from “forbidden
(1) to “permissible” (3), using a button press.
Experiment 3 included 8 intentional harms, 8 accidental
harms, and 32 other non-harm stories. Participants delivered a
non-moral judgment, answering a true/false question about
the content of the final sentence.
Stories were counter balanced and matched as in
Experiment 1. Rest blocks of 14 s were interleaved between
each story. Stories were projected onto a screen via Matlab
5.0 running on an Apple G4 laptop in 24-point white font.

Experiment 4: Twelve individuals diagnosed with Autism
Spectrum Disorder (aged 25-43 years, 2 women). Participants
in were recruited via advertisements placed with the
Asperger’s Association of New England. All participants
were prescreened using the Autism Quotient questionnaire
(AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001). ASD participants then
underwent both the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
(ADOS) (Lord et al 2000, 2002) and impression by a
clinician trained in both ADOS administration and diagnosis
of ASD. All ASD participants received a diagnosis of an
Autism Spectrum Disorder based on their social ADOS score
(6.2 ± 0.6), communication ADOS score (3.5 ± 0.4), and total
ADOS score (9.6 ± 0.8) and on clinical impression based
upon the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV (APA; 2000). The
matched NT (Exp. 1) and ASD (Exp. 4) groups did not differ
in age (NT (mean ± SEM)=27.1 ± 2.3; ASD=31.8 ± 2.1; t(28)
=1.4, p > 0.17] or IQ [NT: 118.1 ± 2.8; ASD: 121.0 ± 3.8; t
(27)=0.60, p > 0.55). No participant had higher language than
social scores, suggesting no specific language deficits.
All participants participated for payment, were native
English speakers, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision
and gave written informed consent in accordance with the
requirements of Institutional Review Board at MIT. Data
from Experiments 2 and 3 have previously been published,
analyzing the magnitude but not the pattern of response in
each region, in Young et al. (2008) and Young & Saxe (2009).

Theory of Mind Localizer task: In all four experiments,
participants also saw 4 runs of a theory of mind localizer task,
contrasting stories requiring inferences about mental state
representations (e.g., thoughts, beliefs) versus physical
representations (e.g., maps, signs, photographs), which are
similar in their meta-representational and logical complexity
but differ in whether the reader is building a representation of
someone else’s mental state. See Saxe & Kanwisher (2003)
and Dodell-Feder et al (2010) for further discussion; stimuli
and presentation from Saxe & Kanwisher 2003, Exp. 2.

Acquisition and Preprocessing
FMRI data were collected in a 3T Siemens scanner at the
Athinoula A. Martinos Imaging Center at the McGovern
Institute for Brain Research at MIT, using a 12-channel head
coil. Using standard echoplanar imaging procedures, we
acquired blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data in 26
near axial slices using 3x3x4 mm voxels (TR=2 s, TE=40 ms,
flip angle=90◦). To allow for steady state magnetization, the
first 4 seconds of each run were excluded.
Data processing and analysis were performed using SPM8
(Experiments 1 & 4) and SPM2 (Experiments 2 & 3) and
custom software. The data were motion corrected, realigned,
normalized onto a common brain space (MNI template),
spatially smoothed using a Gaussian filter (FWHM 5 mm
kernel) and subjected to a high-pass filter (128 Hz).

fMRI Protocol and Task
Experiment 1 & 4: Participants were scanned while reading
60 stories: 12 intentional harm violations, 12 accidental harm
violations, 24 stories with other types of moral violations, and
12 neutral scenarios. Stories were presented in the second
person, using present tense, and displayed in four cumulative
segments: 1. Background (6s), 2. Action (4s), 3. Outcome
(4s), 4. Intent: Good (Accidental Harm) or Bad (Intentional
Harm) (4s). In the scanner, after each story, participants made
moral judgments of the action from “not at all morally
wrong” (1) to “very morally wrong” (4), using a button press.
For example stimuli, see http://mit.edu/jorie/www/
CogSci2012/Koster-Hale_CogSci2012_supp.pdf.
Stories were presented in a pseudorandom order; condition
order was counterbalanced across runs and subjects, and no
condition was immediately repeated. Participants never saw
both intentional and accidental versions of the same scenario.
Word count was matched across conditions. Ten stories were
presented in each 5.5 min run; the total experiment, six runs,
lasted 33.2 min. Rest blocks of 10 s were interleaved between
each story. Stories were projected onto a screen via Matlab
5.0 running on an Apple MacBook Pro in 40-point white font.

fMRI Analysis
All fMRI data were modeled using a boxcar regressor,
convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function
(HRF). The general linear model was used to analyze the
BOLD data from each subject, as a function of condition. The
model included nuisance covariates for run effects, global
mean signal, and an intercept term. A slow event-related
design was used. An event was defined as a single story, the
event onset was defined by the onset of text on screen, and
offset as the end of the story presentation.
Functional Localizer: Individual ROIs Based on prior
research, functional regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in
right and left temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ, LTPJ), medial
precuneus (PC), and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
(DMPFC), for each participant. Using a pre-defined

Experiments 2 & 3: Participants were scanned while reading
48 stories. Experiment 2 included 12 intentional harms, 12
accidental harms, and 24 non-harm stories. All harms were
physical harms, resulting in someone’s death. Stories were
presented in cumulative segments: 1. Background (6s) 2.

hypothesis space for each ROI, each subject’s contrast image
(Belief > Photo) was masked and the peak voxel that occurred
in a cluster of 10 or more voxels significant at p < 0.001 was
selected. All voxels contiguous with the peak voxel,
individually significant at p < 0.001, within a 9mm radius,
were defined as the ROI.
Group ROIs: To compare NT participants from Experiment
1 and ASD participants from Experiment 4, we also identified
independent group-level ROIs, using data from a previous set
of theory of mind localizers (n=477 NT participants, 260
women). Pattern analyses for both groups were then
conducted within these group ROIs. Selecting the same
voxels across participants and group ensured that any
differences found between the NT and ASD group are due to
differences in the pattern itself, rather than any differences in
the ROI selection method, across populations.
Within-ROI Magnitude Analysis: We measured the
response to each condition in each ROI. The percent signal
change (PSC) relative to baseline was calculated for each
time point in each condition, averaging across all voxels in
the ROI and across all blocks in the condition, where PSC(t)
=100 × (average BOLD magnitude for condition (t) – average
BOLD magnitude for fixation) / average BOLD magnitude
for fixation. We averaged the PSC across the entire
presentation – offset 6s from presentation time to account for
hemodynamic lag – to get a single PSC for each condition, in
each ROI, in each participant (Poldrack, 2006).

(12/12), PC (11/12) and DMPFC (5/12).

Behavioral Results
Experiment 1: Participants judged intentional harms (3.31 ±
0.10) to be worse than accidental harms (1.62 ± 0.11; t(14)
=15.1, p<0.0001), both of which were judged to be worse
than neutral stories (1.03 ± .02, t(14)=18.1, p<0.001).
Experiment 2: Replicating the results in Experiment 1,
participants judged intentional harms (2.9 ± .03) to be worse
than accidental harms (1.9 ± .11; t(12)=8.24, p<0.0001).
Experiment 4: Behavioral data were available for only 7
participants with ASD (remaining data were lost due to a
coding error and due to theft of experimental equipment).
When making moral judgments, ASD participants, like NT
participants from Experiment 1, ASD participants judged
intentional harms (3.5 ± 0.12) to be worse than accidental
harms (1.85±0.21; t(6)=8.9; p <0.0001), both of which were
judged to be worse than neutral stories (1.09 ± .04; t(6)
=13.9; p<0.0001).
Group Comparison: A mixed effects ANOVA crossing
Group (NT in Exp 1, ASD in Exp 4) by Condition (neutral,
accidental, intentional) yielded a main effect of condition
and no interaction (F(2,36) = 284.4, p < 0.0001). Post-hoc
t-tests revealed that ASD adults assign more blame for
accidental harms than NT adults (t(19)=1.7, p<0.05), but
there was no difference between NT and ASD judgments of
intentional harms (Moran et al., 2011).

Within-ROI Pattern Analysis: In all experiments, we
conducted within-ROI pattern analyses. Following Haxby et
al. (2001), each participant's data were divided into even and
odd runs (‘partitions’) and then the mean response (beta
value) of every voxel in the ROI was calculated for each
condition. The "pattern" of response was the vector of beta
values across voxels within the ROI. To determine the withincondition correlation, the pattern in one (e.g., even) partition
was compared to the pattern for the same condition in the
opposite (e.g., odd) partition; to determine the acrosscondition correlations the pattern was compared to the
opposite condition, across partitions.
For each individual, an index of classification was
calculated for each condition pair as the z-scored withincondition correlation minus the z-scored across-condition
correlation. A region successfully classified a category of
stimuli if, across individuals, the within-condition correlation
was higher than the across-condition correlation, using a
Student's T complementary cumulative distribution function.

fMRI - Magnitude Analysis
Experiment 1-4 In all three experiments with NT adults, and
in the final experiment with ASD adults, all four ROIs (RTPJ,
LTPJ, PC, DMPFC) showed a higher BOLD response for
moral violations than for neutral acts. However, none of the
regions showed a significant difference between accidental
and intentional harms (all p>.2).

fMRI - Pattern Analysis
Experiment 1 Moral vs. Neutral: Multi-voxel pattern
analyses revealed reliably distinct patterns of neural activity
for moral violations versus neutral acts in all four ROIs:
RTPJ, LTPJ, PC, DMPFC. The pattern generated by stories
within a category (moral or neural) were more correlated with
other stories in the same category compared to stories in the
opposite category (RTPJ: across condition correlation=0.90
(.1), within condition correlation=1.16(.1), t(15)=2.6, p=0.02;
LTPJ: across=1.5(.07), within=1.6(.06), t(14)=2.3 p=0.019;
PC: across=0.86(0.13) within=1.2(0.12), t(14)=3.1, p=0.005;
DMPFC: across=1.1(0.13), within=1.2(0.11), t(12)=1.9,
p=0.04). Group ROIs yielded the same results.
Accidental vs. Intentional: In only the RTPJ, the pattern of
response distinguished between accidental and intentional
harms (across condition correlation=0.91(.1), within
condition correlation=1.08(.11), t(15)=2.6, p=0.01). No other
regions showed distinct patterns of response to intentional
versus accidental harms (all correlation differences < 0.1, all
p > 0.1). Group ROIs yielded the same results, (Figure 1-A).

significant after combining the data from both experiments (r2
(23)=0.35, p=0.003; Figure 1-D).
Experiment 4 (ASD) Moral vs. Neutral: As in NT controls,
pattern analyses revealed a separation in the pattern of
response for moral violations and neutral scenarios in ASD
adults. Using individual ROIs, significant discrimination was
found in RTPJ and LTPJ (RTPJ: across=1.2(0.18), within=1.4
(0.16), t(11)=3.2, p=0.005; LTPJ: across=1.3(0.12),
within=1.5(0.11), t(11)=2.3, p=0.02; see Figure 1); there was
a trend in the same direction in the PC. DMPFC was found in
only 5 of 12 individuals so we did not have sufficient power
to test for pattern discriminability. However, using group
ROIs, we found significant discrimination in DMPFC as well
(across=1(0.12), within=1.2(0.10), t(11)=3, p=0.007).
Accidental vs. Intentional: Pattern analysis within both group
and individual ROIs revealed no pattern discrimination
between accidental and intentional harms in any ToM region,
in participants with ASD (all differences < 0.1, p > 0.1).
Group Comparison Moral vs. Neutral: A Group (ASD, NT)
x Pattern (within, across) ANOVA revealed that NT and ASD
participants show equally robust neural discrimination in
response to moral violations versus neutral actions in their
RTPJ, with a main effect of Pattern (F(2,51) = 12.4, p = .002),
no effect of Group (F(1,51)=1.07, p=.3), and no interaction (F
(2,51) = .13, p = .7).
Accidental vs. Intentional: In contrast, NT participants
discriminated between accidental and intentional harms to a
greater extent than ASD participants, reflected in a significant

analyses revealed distinct neural patterns for accidental and

interaction between RTPJ and each of the three other regions
(all F > 8, all p < 0.007), and no interactions between any of
the other regions (however, see Smith et al., 2011 for caution
in interpreting differences in discriminability across regions).

Behavioral and Neural Correlation: In Experiments 1 and
2, NT participants provided moral judgments of each scenario
in the scanner, allowing us to determine whether behavioral
responses were related to the spatial pattern of the neural
response in RTPJ or any other region. For each participant,
weFebruary

intentional versus accidental harms. We tested whether this
difference score was correlated, across participants, with the
index of classification in each region (intentional vs.
accidental, within-condition correlation minus acrosscondition correlation). In both experiments we found that
only in the RTPJ was the difference between intentional and
accidental harms in individuals’ moral judgments correlated

Symptom Severity and Neural Correlation: In ASD
participants, we found no significant correlation between
neural pattern and behavior in any region. However, we
found, in RTPJ and no other region, a significant inverse
correlation with symptom severity: individuals with higher
ADOS (Lord et al, 2000, 2002) scores showed less neural
discriminability between intentional and accidental harms (r2

differences in pattern discriminability in the RTPJ. While
Experiment 1 used a blameworthiness scale (“How much
blame should you get?”) and Experiment 2 used a
permissibility scale (“How permissible was Steve’s action?”),
we found the same result in both studies: individuals who
showed more sensitivity to the dimension of intent in their
neural pattern – those who processed accidental and
intentional harms most differently in their RTPJ – were also
those who showed the most forgiveness to characters who
accidentally harmed someone.
As in prior work, the average magnitude of RTPJ response
did not distinguish between intentional and accidental harms.
This observation fits in a larger pattern emerging in the
literature: while the RTPJ is selective for the cognitive
process of mental state reasoning – and not, for example,
generic attentional processes (Scholz et al., 2008; Young et
al., 2010b; see also Decety and Lamm, 2007) – the average
RTPJ response is unaffected by changes in the specific
features of mental states, such as whether beliefs are true or
false (Jenkins and Mitchell, 2009; Young, et al, 2010b),
justified or unjustified (Young et al., 2010c), positively or
negatively valenced (Kliemann et al., 2008), plausible or
crazy (Young et al., 2010b), “constrained” or “openended” (Jenkins and Mitchell, 2009), attributed to friends or
enemies (Bruneau & Saxe in press), or first-order or higherorder (Koster-Hale & Saxe, 2011).
These findings left open the question of whether and how
the RTPJ or any other neural substrate encoded specific
mental state features, like the dimension of intent. A key
contribution of the current study then is to reveal that the
dimension of intent is encoded in the voxel-wise pattern of
the RTPJ, and specifically for the evaluation of harm.

Discussion and Conclusion
Moral Judgments: Neurotypical adults
A central aim of this study was to ask whether the difference
between accidental and intentional harms could be decoded
from the pattern of response within theory of mind brain
regions. Across three experiments with neurotypical (NT)
adults, using different stimuli, paradigms, and participants,
we found converging results: stories about intentional versus
accidental harms elicited spatially distinct patterns of
response within the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ).
Moreover, this neural response mirrored behavioral
judgments: individuals who showed more distinct patterns in
the RTPJ also made a larger distinction between intentional
and accidental harms in their moral judgments.
The convergence across experiments provides strong
evidence that intentional and accidental harms can be
discriminated, using MVPA, in RTPJ. Designed to test a
series of separate questions, the three experiments differed in
the story content, voice of the narrative (2nd or 3rd person),
the order of information provided, the length of the stories,
the number of stories per condition, and the participants’
explicit task. Perhaps most importantly, the information
indicating that the harmful action was accidental or
intentional was provided by different cues. In Experiment 1,
the same mental state content (e.g., your cousin’s allergy to
peanuts) was described as known or unknown (e.g., “you had
no idea” vs. “you definitely knew”). By contrast, in
Experiments 2 and 3, sentences with the same syntax and
mental state verbs were used to describe beliefs with different
content (e.g., “Steve believes the ground beef is safe /
rotton”). Nevertheless, the spatial pattern of response was
reliable and distinct for intentional versus accidental harms,
and only in the right TPJ. The generalizability of the pattern
discriminability indicates that, rather than being driven by
specific stimulus features or task demands, the discriminable
neural patterns reflect an underlying distinction in the
representation of accidental and intentional hams.
In Experiments 1 and 2, participants made moral judgments
in the scanner. In both experiments, individuals differed in the
amount of blame they assign to accidental harm, some
weighing intent more strongly (and thus were more forgiving)
and some weighing outcome more strongly (and thus were
more condemning), (Young & Saxe, 2009). These individual
differences in moral judgment were predicted by individual

Moral Judgments: ASD adults
A group of high functioning adults with Autism Spectrum
Disorders showed a different response profile: the response of
the RTPJ showed a reliable spatial pattern of response across
moral stories, compared to neutral stories, but did not
distinguish between intentional and accidental harms.
Moreover, we found that symptom severity on the ADOS was
predictive of decreased neural discrimination in RTPJ: those
individuals with more severe diagnoses showed a less distinct
neural response to accidental and intentional harms. Thus, the
neural pattern mirrored the behavioral performance
previously observed in participants with ASD (Moran et al
2011): compared to NT controls, participants with ASD
judged accidental and intentional harms to be more similar in
moral permissibility (though note that, in the current sample,
the group by condition interaction was not replicated, likely
due to lack of power).
One possible mechanism of reduced pattern information in
ASD might be more noisy or heterogeneous neural responses.
However, both the strong discrimination between moral
violations and neutral stories, and the high overall pattern
correlations speak against this alternative. Rather ASD
participants seem to show a less sensitive neural response:
accidental and intentional harms appear to be processed by
the same neural sub-populations within the RTPJ.

Multivoxel pattern analysis may therefore be a successful
way of measuring behaviorally-relevant neural differences in
ASD. Note that due to the demands of the task and scanning
environment, the ASD participants in this study (as in
previous task-oriented neuroimaging studies) are extremely
high functioning, which may limit the generalizability of the
results to lower-functioning individuals. Nevertheless, the
individuals in the current study do have disproportionate
difficulties with social interaction and communication, and
the current results may provide a window on the neural
mechanism underlying these difficulties.

Conclusion
In summary, MVPA allows us to determine (i) that features of
mental state representations that are not observable in the
mean neural signal, including the behaviorally relevant
difference between accidental and intentional harms, are
encoded in the pattern of neural activity; (ii) that these mental
state features elicit both stable and distinct patterns of neural
activity in RTPJ, a region implicated in mental state
reasoning; (iii) that individual differences in neural
discrimination predict individual differences in moral
judgment; and (iv) that atypical behavioral patterns in ASD
are reflected in atypical neural patterns, which (v) are more
atypical with increasing symptom severity.
