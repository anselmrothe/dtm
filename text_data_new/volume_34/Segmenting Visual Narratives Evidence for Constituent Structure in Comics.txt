Abstract

Background
Since the 1950s, research on language has stressed that
sentences are organized into hierarchic constituents, rather
than linear word-to-word connections (e.g., Chomsky,
1957).
An analogous distinction between local relationships and
hierarchic segmentation has underlined research of text and
discourse. Traditional approaches emphasize coherence
relationships between individual sentences (Halliday &
Hasan, 1976; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998). Participants can
intuitively segment texts into consistent groupings (Gee &
Grosjean, 1984; Mandler & Johnson, 1977), suggesting that
readers’ comprehension extends beyond adjacent
relationships between individual sentences.
Some theories have formally described hierarchical
relationships in narrative, such as “story grammars” (e.g.
Mandler & Johnson, 1977; Rumelhart, 1975; Thorndyke,
1977), which use phrase structure rules to organize
narratives around characters’ goal-driven events.
Constituent structure in these models was examined using
clustering models (Gee & Grosjean, 1984; Mandler, 1987;
Mandler & Johnson, 1977), similar to those employed by
early psycholinguistic research on syntactic relations (e.g.
Levelt, 1970). Participants divided a narrative into logical
groupings, and these intuitions were then submitted to the
algorithms in hierarchic clustering models. These analyses
yielded tree structures that closely correlated with the
models predicted by the original theories.
As in verbal discourse, theories of visual narrative have
also emphasized linear relationships between individual
images (McCloud, 1993). However, beyond such linear
relationships, participants also intuitively divide visual
narratives into segments (Gernsbacher, 1985). Again, this
suggests that comprehension may extend beyond adjacent
relationships.
Recently, Cohn (2003, In Press) has proposed a
theoretical model of narrative structure that formalizes the

We have proposed that visual narratives in comics are
organized with a hierarchic narrative “grammar.” Inspired by
classic “click” studies of syntax, we inserted blank
“disruption” panels Before, At, or After the constituent
boundaries of comic strips. In self-paced viewing, Experiment
1 found that blanks After the boundary were viewed slower
than Before or At the boundary. Panels immediately
following blanks were slower than corresponding panels in
sequences without blank panels, but only when placed Before
or After the boundary. Three ordinal panel positions
following the boundary, panels following blanks At the
boundary or with No-Blanks were viewed faster than panels
following blanks After or Before the boundary. This supports
constituency because disruptions had greater impact within,
as opposed to between, constituents. Using ERPs, Experiment
2 found a larger anterior negativity to blanks within
constituents (Before/After) than between constituents (At).
This indicates disruptions of constituents are recognized
before reaching a subsequent panel. A larger P600 appeared
to blanks After the boundary than in the first constituent
(Before/At). This positivity may reflect a reanalysis reflecting
the inability to integrate all prior panels into a single
constituent, since they are divided by the constituent
boundary.

Introduction
Drawings have conveyed narratives through sequences of
images for thousands of years, but in contemporary society
they appear most prevalently in comics. In comparison with
research on the structure and comprehension of verbal
narrative, however, little is known about mechanisms of
processing sequential images. For example, are narrative
units integrated linearly across each adjacent relationship or
they organized into hierarchic constituents?

constituent structure of visual narrative. Like story
grammars’ treatment of sentences, this model organizes
panels into hierarchic constituents (though important
differences distinguish this approach from story grammars,
and this model could potentially provide an alternative
approach for describing the structure of verbal discourse).
Figure 1 illustrates the narrative structure for a 6-panel
Peanuts comic strip. This sequence depicts a baseball game
that starts with Lucy hitting a ball, which allows Charlie
Brown to run home and score, escaping a tag by Schroeder.
The first panel shows Lucy tossing a ball. This panel
functions as an Initial, initiating the interactions in the
sequence. In the second panel, Lucy hits the ball, a narrative
“Peak” as the culmination of the initiated action. Together,
these two panels act as an Initial constituent that propels the
rest of the sequence. A second constituent begins with
Schroeder waiting for the ball—nothing happens here
except a set-up of the characters (Establisher). The next
Initial begins the new set of events, which climax in the
penultimate Peak panel—Charlie interrupts the catch by
sliding into the base. The last panel then resolves this
interaction (Release). Together, these panels act as a Peak
that is set up by the constituent-level Initial of the first
panels. Thus, at a higher level of processing, the first
constituent (Lucy hitting the ball) acts as an Initial, which
facilitates the second constituent (Charlie scoring), a Peak.
As a result, the narrative structure operates on both the panel
level and the level of whole constituencies.

Experiment 1: Self-paced Viewing
In a classic experiment on syntactic structure, Fodor and
Bever (1965) pioneered a “click technique” where they
played a verbal sentence in one ear of a participant, and then
introduced short bursts of white noise (“clicks”) in the other
ear. They reasoned that, if clauses constitute the perceptual
processing units of sentences, clicks that disrupt those units
would be harder to discern than clicks occurring between
clauses. They found that participants were better able to
recall clicks that were placed at the clause boundaries than
those before or after it. Also, participants tended to falsely
recall clicks within constituencies as occurring within the
constituency break. Subsequent studies found similar
findings, with the overall interpretation that such disruptions
reflect the psychological validity of a syntactic constituent
structure (for review see Garrett & Bever, 1974).
In Experiment 1, we used an analogous “disruption”
paradigm to determine whether the comprehension of visual
sequences also draws upon a constituent structure in
narrative sequences. We measured viewing times in graphic
sequences where blank white “disruption” panels were
inserted Before, At, or After the narrative constituency
boundary.

Methods
Participants
60 self-defined comic readers (35 male, 27 female, mean
age = 24.03) from the Tufts University student population
and surrounding neighborhoods were paid for their
participation.
Stimuli
Novel 6-frame long sequences were created (160 sets) using
individual panels culled from several volumes of Charles
Schulz’s Peanuts. Using Cohn’s (In Press) model of visual
narrative, we designed sequences that had two narrative
constituents. This was confirmed using a behavioral task in
which 20 participants drew lines to divide strips into two
parts. Our final 120 strips had a 71% agreement on where
constituent boundaries were located. Each sequence had
constituent boundaries appearing after panel 2, 3, or 4 (40 of
each type). Using these strips, we then inserted blank
“disruption” panels Before, At, or After the constituency
boundaries (as notated at the bottom of Figure 1), along
with No-Blank control sequences. Because of the variation
in position of the boundary, blank panels across all
sequences could appear between the second and fifth panel
positions, and items were counterbalanced across four lists
such that each participant only viewed a sequence once. 15
fillers in each list had two successive blank panels and onethird of 75 additional no-blank fillers had violations of
coherence.

Figure 1: Narrative structure in a comic strip with
markings Before, At, and After the narrative constituent
boundary.
While clustering analyses have shown evidence for
hierarchic structure in verbal discourse, no studies to date
have examined constituent in sequential images.
Furthermore, evidence that narrative constituent structure is
used during online processing has yet to be explored in any
modality. Here we describe two experiments to determine
whether constituents are used when processing sequential
images.

Procedure
Participants viewed comic panels one frame at a time on a
computer screen, self-pacing their way through the
sequence. After each sequence, they rated the coherence of
the strip on a 1 to 5 scale.

The placement of blank panels in a sequence also
impacted the processing of subsequent panels. Viewing
times to panels appearing immediately after the blank
differed from corresponding panels in sequences that had
No-Blank (i.e., Blank +1, see Figure 3). Overall, we found a

Discussion
Blank panels were viewed slower when they appeared After
compared to Before or At the narrative constituent
boundary. Panels immediately following blanks were slower
than corresponding panels in sequences without a preceding

blank panel, but only when placed Before or After the
boundary. A delayed effect of this disruption appeared three
panels after the narrative constituent boundary. At this
position, panels following blanks At the boundary or with
No-Blanks were viewed faster than panels following blanks
After or Before the boundary. These results are consistent
with the presence of constituent structure to visual narrative:
a blank panel disruption had greater impact within
(Before/After) as opposed to between (At) constituents.

appeared between 300 and 400 milliseconds. This (early)
right anterior negativity has led researchers to argue for
overlap in the neural resources used to process structure in
both music and language (Koelsch, Gunter, Wittfoth, &
Sammler, 2005; Patel, et al., 1998).
Only one study has previously hinted at a LAN during the
processing of visual sequences. Cohn et al. (2012)
manipulated the presence or absence of narrative structure
and semantic relatedness between panels in visual
narratives. A larger negativity was found to sequences of
scrambled panels (which had no semantic relations and no
narrative structure) than to sequences with only narrative
structure but no semantic theme (i.e., the sequence followed
a narrative arc, but used panels from various sequences
which had no meaningful relationship with each other).
However, this negativity only appeared in a localized left
anterior region, and was larger in participants with higher
comic reading expertise. This left anterior effect was
distinguished from a more widespread N400 effect that was
greater in magnitude in these sequences that lacked
semantic relations than to panels in sequences with no
narrative structure, but with semantic relations to a general
theme (like baseball), and to semantically and narratively
congruous Normal sequences. We suggested that the left
localized negativity—distinguished form the N400—might
be analogous to the left anterior negativity effect seen to
violations of structure in language. However, because this
study did not directly introduce violations to narrative
structure, this interpretation was speculative.
In Experiment 2, we predicted that violations of
constituency in visual narratives would elicit similar ERP
effects as violations of structure during sentence processing:
P600 and LAN effects. We used the same set of stimuli
from Experiment 1 and measured ERPs directly at blank
panels.

Experiment 2: Event-Related Potentials
Different ERP components have been associated with
manipulations of semantic and syntactic constraints. For
example, the N400 ERP component has been associated
with semantic processing of words (Kutas & Hillyard,
1980), individual visual images (Holcomb & McPherson,
1994), and images in visual narratives images (Cohn,
Paczynski, Jackendoff, Holcomb, & Kuperberg, 2012; West
& Holcomb, 2002). The N400 effect has been suggested as
indexing the spreading activation of a word or image’s
meaning as it integrates with its preceding context to the
information stored in semantic memory (Kutas &
Federmeier, 2011).
In contrast, two ERP components have been linked to
violations of grammatical structure during sentence
processing. First, the P600 is a positive deflection that peaks
from 600-800ms (Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992). It is seen to
syntactic anomalies and ambiguities and has been
interpreted as reflecting a process of continued analysis
and/or repair as structural and semantic information are
integrated to make sense of a sentence (Friederici, 2002;
Kuperberg, 2007).
Waveforms resembling the P600 have also been found in
domains outside of language. For example, in studies using
silent movie clips of everyday events, a P600 was seen to
“action violation” endings in which a predicted action was
carried out with an incongruous object (e.g. a person
preparing to cut a piece of bread followed by an image of
the person attempting to cut the bread with an iron). This
suggested that the P600 effect may reflect the integration of
structural and semantic information around an event beyond
linguistic processing (Sitnikova, Holcomb, & Kuperberg,
2008).
Certain syntactic operations have also been tied to a leftanterior negativity (LAN), which falls in the same time
window as the N400 (between 300 and 500ms), but is
distributed over frontal and left lateralized regions (Neville,
Nicol, Barss, Forster, & Garrett, 1991). This component has
been associated with violations of syntactic constituent
structure in sentences (Friederici, 2002).
Anterior negativities outside of language have also been
associated with violations of hierarchic structure in music.
Patel and colleagues (1998) found a P600 to structural
violations in musical sequences (e.g., a nearby key chord or
a distant-key chord appearing after an otherwise in-key
musical sequence). Another negative-going effect,
distributed over right anterior and temporal sites, also

Methods
Participants
24 self-defined comic readers from Tufts University (8
male, 16 female, mean age = 19.9) participated in the study
for compensation.
Stimuli
The same stimuli were used in Experiment 2 as in
Experiment 1.
Procedure
Participants viewed each sequence one panel at a time on a
computer screen while ERPs were measured to all panels.
After each sequence, participants rated its coherence on a 1
to 5 scale.

Results
At the blank panel, between 500 and 700 milliseconds,
repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant
interactions between Disruption Position, Region, and

237

Electrode Site at midline regions, and interactions between
Disruption Position, Region, and Hemisphere at peripheral
regions of the scalp (all Fs > 3.24, all ps < .05). Follow-ups
showed a larger negativity to blank panels that appeared
Before the boundary than to those appearing At the
boundary at left anterior regions (F3, FC5, F7). Blanks
appearing After the boundary evoked a larger negativity
than those At the boundary again in left anterior regions (F3,
FC5, F7) as well as at FPz and FP2. ERPs to Blank panels
appearing Before or After the boundary did not differ in
amplitude.

At posterior sites, a larger P600 appeared to blank panels
placed After the boundary (within the second constituent)
than those placed Before or At the constituency boundary.
The contrast between the After and At conditions revealed a
significant effect at O1, Oz, and O2, and between the After
and Before conditions showed an effect at O2.

Discussion
A larger negativity was found to disruption blank panels
that appeared within constituents (Before/After) than to
blanks that appeared between constituents (At). This
negativity localized to anterior, and somewhat left
lateralized, locations. This is consistent with the lateralized
anterior distribution of negativity effects shown to
violations of syntax in sentences (Neville, et al., 1991) and
music (Koelsch, et al., 2005; Patel, et al., 1998). It is
important to note that it is only possible to confirm or verify
that a blank panel has actually disrupted a narrative
constituent once the subsequent panel is reached. However,
we still saw a larger anterior negativity where the disruption
occurred Before than At the boundary on the blank panel
itself, prior to confirmation on the subsequent panel. This
suggests that the brain may make online predictions about
the building of constituent structure as a narrative
progresses.
In addition to the anterior negativity effect, we also saw a
P600 effect to blank panels appearing After (versus Before
or At) the boundary. Because this positivity appeared to
blanks only after a new constituent had been reached, we
suggest that it reflected the failure of integrating all of the
prior panels into a single constituent. This blank followed a
panel after the constituent boundary, meaning that the
preceding panel would be unable to be integrated into a
single constituent with the other prior panels, thereby
evoking a reanalysis of starting a new constituent
(Friederici, 2002; Kuperberg, 2007).

General Discussion
The results of Experiment 1 suggest that the introduction of
a blank panel into a sequence has a greater impact on
viewing times of subsequent panels if it falls within a
narrative constituent (Before/After a narrative boundary)
than between narrative constituents (At a narrative
boundary). This provides evidence that comprehenders use
narrative boundaries during the processing of visual
sequences. The results of Experiment 2 support this
interpretation. Moreover, because effects were seen on the
blank panel itself, this further suggests that comprehenders
of visual sequences make active predictions about narrative
constituent structures.
Taken together, these results show that disruptions within
a narrative constituent have a greater impact on processing
than disruptions between narrative constituents. This
suggests that the comprehension of sequential images draws
upon a narrative structure that is organized into constituents,
analogous to grammatical structure in language.
