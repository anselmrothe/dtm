Abstract
This study sought to explore the range of beliefs about weight
gain and whether these beliefs varied according to personal weight
management history. A questionnaire specifically designed for the
study was completed by 376 participants (94 males, 282 females;
mean age 43.65 years, SD=13.24). Principal component analysis
identified five causal attribution factors which were interpreted as
Lack-of-Self-Control,
Lifestyle-Limitations,
Psychological,
Biological/Medical, and Modern-Living. The level of endorsement
for these causal attribution factors suggested an acknowledgement
of the multiple causes to weight gain. However, the most highly
endorsed
factor,
Lack-of-Self
Control,
reflected
the
“commonsense” view of weight gain being a matter of overeating,
under-exercising and lacking in self control. Personal weight
management history was found to be associated with variations in
beliefs with the more effort one had applied to weight
management; the more highly they endorsed causes both within
and outside of individual control.
Keywords: implicit theories, causal explanations, weight
gain, obesity.

Introduction
Obesity is considered a worldwide epidemic (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2000) with over half the adult
population in many countries classified as either overweight
or obese (Bovbjerg, 2008; Lim, Norman, Clifton, & Noakes,
2008; Thorburn, 2005). Overweight and obesity are widely
recognized as being associated with enormous
psychological, health, and economic costs, both on
individual and national scales (Stroebe, 2008). More
recently it has been recognized that such costs occur with
any level of weight gain. Increases in body weight of less
than five kilograms have been found to be associated with
increased disease load, with the associations occurring even
within the healthy BMI range (Lim, et al., 2008; WHO,
2000). This has contributed to the WHO‟s (2000) decision
to advocate the prevention of weight gain in adults as the
key strategy in managing obesity. This strategy aims to
prevent initial weight gain in normal weight adults, as well
as preventing further weight gain in those who are already
overweight or obese. At an individual level, prevention of
weight gain is quantified as gain of less than five kilograms
across adulthood (B. A. Swinburn, et al., 2004).
Prevention of weight gain has now become a focus of
public discussion and debate, with numerous theories of
causes and solutions in the public arena (Faith, Fontaine,
Baskin, & Allison, 2007). Individual changes are often
asserted as solutions (Lombard, et al., 2009) along with a
range of population scale strategies which include education

campaigns to raise community awareness about the
importance of healthy eating, healthy weight and physical
activity; changes to urban design and land use to encourage
physical activity; and reshaping the food supply to increase
access to healthy food, restrict access to unhealthy foods
and a regulation of the sugar, fat, and salt contents of foods
(NOTF Obesity Working Group, 2009).
Understanding the beliefs and attitudes regarding weight
gain held within the community is extremely important for
the acceptance and successful implementation of
population-level interventions aimed at reducing weight
gain (Lombard et al., 2009). Personal beliefs and attitudes
about a psychological problem constitute an implicit theory
(or explanatory model). An implicit theory contains the
individual‟s understanding of the causes of the problem, the
expected course and prognosis. Implicit theories arise from
the individual‟s personal experiences, but are primarily
mediated by the individual‟s social and cultural
environment (Furnham, 1988). Many reasons for exploring
implicit theories have been identified, particularly within a
public health framework. The theories held by lay people
may contain elements that have been previously overlooked
by the scientific community. In addition, the experience of
lay people may place them in a position to identify flaws
and shortcomings in current scientific theories or models
(Entwistle, Renfrew, Yearley, Forrester, & Lamont, 1998;
Popay & Williams, 1996). Addressing such differences
between lay knowledge and scientific research also helps to
increase the community‟s perception of the relevance of
research and its resulting policy, and hence the acceptance
of interventions (Popay & Williams, 1996).
Various studies have examined the beliefs about obesity
amongst lay and professional groups such as doctors,
nurses, dieticians, and teachers. These studies have
generally found that most people did recognize multiple
factors as contributing to obesity, but were more likely to
recognize factors within the individual‟s control. For
example, Ogden and Flanagan (2008) in their comparison of
general practitioners and lay people found that behavioral
causes of obesity (e.g., not enough exercise, eating too
much, and too many unhealthy foods) were most strongly
endorsed in both groups. Social causes of obesity such as a
lack of education, and biological causes, were not strongly
endorsed by either group.
Okonkwo and While (2010), in a study involving
University students, found reduced physical activity and the
promotion and low cost of fast foods to be strongly
endorsed, with genetics receiving the lowest endorsement.

2511

However, they found that participants who were overweight
and obese were more likely to endorse genetics and the high
costs of fruit and vegetables as causes of obesity. This
suggests those who have experienced weight gain are more
likely to have greater awareness of factors outside of
individual control.
Physical inactivity, eating too much of the wrong foods,
and mood changes leading to overeating were again found
as the most strongly endorsed causes of obesity in a study of
beliefs held by British dieticians (Harvey, Summerbell,
Kirk, & Hills, 2002), with biological factors again being
least endorsed. This study also sought to determine
differences in beliefs about obesity compared to overweight.
It was found that the dieticians held similar causal beliefs
for both overweight and obesity, but that obese people were
seen as more responsible for their weight than were
overweight people.
These studies provide insight into beliefs about obesity
amongst both lay and professional populations. However,
obesity is a recognizable medical condition that refers to an
excess of body fat (C. L. Ogden, Carroll & Legal, 2003).
Obesity has also often been conceptualized as a biological
deviation from the „normal‟ healthy state (Jutel, 2006). In
contrast, weight gain is less visibly recognizable, is
susceptible to fluctuations over the lifespan and affects a
larger proportion of the population. Furthermore,
individuals may fail to recognize their own weight gain over
time and fail to recognize their weight problems (Ziebland,
Thorogood, Fuller & Muir, 1996). Consequently, implicit
theories about weight gain may be different to those of
obesity.
One of the few studies to examine the issue of weight gain
was conducted by Jackson, Ball & Crawford (2001) who
examined the beliefs about the causes of personal weight
gain and loss. The causes were assessed through open
answer responses. However, categories for response coding
were limited so that a full assessment of causal theories was
not possible. Despite this, they found that over one third of
participants had gained weight over the previous 12 months,
and fewer than half of these acknowledged changes in the
amount of food or activity alone as a cause of their weight
gain. Other causes given were changes in food type, medical
conditions, growth, ageing, and “no special reason”.
Paxton and Sculthorpe (1999) examined the issues of
weight and weight gain by using the Dieting Beliefs and
health locus of control scales and found that beliefs about
weight varied according to socioeconomic status and
weight. They found that the low SES group was more likely
to recognize the influence of factors outside the individual‟s
control (e.g., luck, genes) and environmental factors on
weight compared to those in high SES. The authors partly
attributed this finding to the limited access to resources
faced by the low SES group (Paxton & Sculthorpe, 1999).
Consistent with Okonkwo and While‟s (2010) study,
overweight participants were more likely to endorse factors
outside of the individual‟s control as well as environmental
factors compared to normal weight participants. However,

they were also more likely to hold the belief that weight is
internally controlled. The authors suggest that this higher
endorsement of both internally controlled and externally
controlled factors may result from both an increased
sensitivity to the individual focus of weight loss campaigns,
as well as an unsuccessful dieting history, although long
term history was not examined.
The current study sought to conduct a more
comprehensive examination of the range of beliefs/attitudes
about weight gain in adults by using questionnaire items
generated from both the general public and the literature on
obesity and weight gain. Previous research have used
limited number of items and/or predetermined summed
categories/scales imposed by the researchers, thereby
limiting the ability of these studies to fully explore causal
beliefs held by the general community. The current study
also examined whether implicit theories of weight gain
differed on the basis of personal weight management
history. Studies on weight loss intervention have reported
that overweight individuals viewed their weight problem as
arising from their own motivation and physical
shortcomings or as a response to specific issues or
challenges in their lives (Greener et al., 2010).

Method
Participants
The participants (N= 376; 94 males, 282 females; mean age
= 43.25, S.D. = 13.64) in the main study were recruited
from regional (e.g., Cobar, Dubbo, Parkes,) and
metropolitan areas of Australia (e.g., Adelaide, Melbourne,
Sydney) through a snowball sampling approach and random
distribution of the questionnaire in shopping areas in a
major regional centre in central western New South Wales
(e.g., Bathurst, Orange).

Materials
The items to be included in the questionnaire were
developed from both a pilot study and a literature review.
Twenty participants (11 females, 9 males), took part in the
pilot study. The age range was 18-74 years, (mean=38.00,
SD=14.51), with participants from both regional and
metropolitan areas. Each participant was interviewed
individually and asked to provide possible causes of weight
gain in adults. Any causal belief identified by two or more
participants were phrased into a questionnaire item and
included in the final questionnaire. The resultant items were
supplemented by items drawn from the literature including
government publications and policy documents (e.g.,
NOTF, 2006; NOTF Obesity Working Group, 2009;
National Preventative Health Taskforce, 2010; Smith, et al.,
2005; WHO, 2000; WHO, 2002); previous studies that have
explored beliefs about weight management, weight gain,
and obesity (e.g., J. Ogden & Flanagan, 2008; Okonkwo &
While, 2010); and current literature that examine scientific
theories of weight gain and obesity (e.g., Eby & Colditz,
2008; Faith, et al., 2007; Greener, et al., 2010; Lombard, et

2512

al., 2009; Stroebe, 2008; B. Swinburn & Egger, 2004; B. A.
Swinburn, et al., 2004).
The final questionnaire listed 42 causal items of weight
gain. Participants were asked to rate the importance of each
causal item on a six point scale (not at all important to
extremely important). Demographic information regarding
gender, age, location, education level, current weight and
height were also obtained. Weight gain was defined in the
questionnaire as a gain of more than 5kg above the
participant‟s usual body weight. Participants were also
asked about unplanned weight gain, years spent on weight
management, degree of effort in weight management.

Procedure
Participants recruited using the snow-ball sampling
approach were given the choice of paper-based or electronic
questionnaires. Envelopes were provided with the option of
returning directly to the researcher, or through prepaid post.
Participants recruited in shopping areas were given the
option of completing the questionnaire at that time or at a
later time. Those completing the questionnaire at the
shopping area were provided with a sealable envelope to
ensure anonymity and confidentiality. Reply-paid envelopes
were supplied to shoppers who chose to complete their
questionnaire at a later time. Questionnaires were
distributed over a three week period across a variety of days
and times in an effort to include shoppers from a variety of
backgrounds. The questionnaire took approximately 15-20
minutes to complete. Return of the completed questionnaire
was taken as indication of consent. The overall return rate of
paper-based questionnaires was approximately 47%.

Results
Preliminary analyses.
Participant‟s postcode and suburb were used to classify
participants as located in a major city, inner-regional, or
outer-regional/very remote according to the Australian
Standard Geographical Areas - Remoteness Structure
developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
Socioeconomic status was calculated according to postcode
percentile rankings within Australia using the ABS
Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) data cube 2006.
Current BMIs were calculated using reported height and
weight. The planned tests were quite robust to violations of
distribution, however where skewness was severe
appropriate transformations
were conducted
and
transformed data used for analyses. No significant
differences were obtained between the participants using
electronic and paper versions of the questionnaire with
regards to mean factor ratings.

Main Analyses.
A principal component analysis was conducted on the
ratings of the 42 causal items. A Velicer‟s minimum
average partial test (MAP) (Zwick & Velicer, 1986) was
used to determine the number of components to be

extracted. Varimax rotation was applied to determine
orthogonal factors and enhance interpretability. Only those
items with factor loadings greater than 0.30 were included.
To further enhance the uniqueness of the factors, items with
similar loadings (+/-.20) on multiple factors were excluded
from the factors and any further interpretation. Mean factor
scores were calculated using a sum of scores by factor
divided by the number of items (DiStefano, Zhu, &
Mîndrilă, 2009).
A five-factor solution was extracted from the data which
accounted for 50.57% of the variance. Fifteen items were
excluded from further analysis due to similar loadings on
two or more factors (see Table 1). The first factor, labeled
Lack-of-Self-Control (Cronbach‟s α=.81), accounting for
12.19% of the variance, consisted of 8 items relating to a
lack of control of diet and exercise. Labeled LifestyleLimitations, the second factor accounted for 11.37% of the
variance and included 5 items (Cronbach‟s α=.76). These
items reflect the impact of the higher cost of healthy eating,
the influence of long and irregular work hours. This factor
also included a lack of awareness of the effects of current
lifestyle on weight gain. Explaining 10.63% of the variance,
the third factor consisted of 6 items (Cronbach‟s α=.85).
This factor was labeled Psychological to reflect the content
of the items (i.e., depression, stress and low selfconfidence). This component also included the ageing item
(i.e., Normal part of growing older). The fourth factor was
labeled Biological/Medical and its items related to
hormonal, metabolic and medication-related causes.
Consisting of 4 items (Cronbach‟s α=.80) it explained
8.27% of the variance. The final factor, explaining 8.11% of
the variance, was labeled Modern-Living (Cronbach‟s α
=.72). This consisted of 4 items reflecting the reduction in
physical activity through the use of cars, modern appliances,
and electronic entertainment as well as the recent surge in
the “diet” food industry.
Mean factor scores were calculated and are presented in
Table 1 with mean item ratings (and standard deviations),
the corresponding overall item ranking, and the rotated
component loadings. Higher mean scores reflect a greater
degree of endorsement in causing weight gain. Lack-of-SelfControl was regarded as the most important causal factor
with its eight items being the top eight ranked items based
on means. Although still acknowledged as important, lower
means were found for the other causal attribution factors.
Pair-wise comparisons were conducted with a Bonferroni
adjustment for the ten possible comparisons resulting in a
critical α=.005. The comparisons confirmed that Lack-ofSelf-Control was rated as significantly more important
compared to the remaining factors (all ts > 20.69, p <
.0001). The ratings of the remaining causal attribution
factors did not differ from each other (all ts < 1.92, p > .05).
Mean ratings for each factor were compared according to
demographic and weight history. A Bonferroni correction
was applied to reduce family-wise error rate across the five
causal attribution factors resulting in a critical α=.05/5=.01.
Independent samples t-tests showed that females rated the

2513

importance of Lifestyle-Limitations higher than did males
t(365)=-3.06, p=.002, d=0.39. Females also rated the factors
of Psychological and Biological/Medical as more important
as causes of weight gain than did males t(372)=-3.56,
p<.001, d=0.43; and t(361)=-3.38, p=.001, d=0.41,
respectively.
A one-way ANOVA showed an effect for location for the
factor of Modern-Living1, F(2, 367)=9.88, p<.001, η2=.05.
A Tukey‟s post-hoc analysis (adjusted for uneven group
sizes–Tukey-Kramer) with a critical α=0.1/3=.003 to adjust
for the three possible pair-wise comparisons, showed that
those residing in major cities rated Modern-Living1 as
significantly less important that did those residing in either
inner-regional or outer-regional/remote areas. A significant
difference was also found for location for the Lack-of-SelfControl1 component, F(2, 367)=5.75, p=.003, η²=.03. Post
hoc analysis showed that those residing in inner-regional
areas rated this factor as being significantly more important
than those in major cities.
Correlations (all two tailed) showed that age was weakly
associated with Modern-Living r(243)=.180, p<.001,
R2=.03; with increasing age reflecting increased importance
placed on Modern-Living as a cause of weight gain. A
greater degree of effort in weight management was related
to greater endorsement of the Lack-of-Self-Control factor
r(304)=.26, p<.001, R2=.07. Increasing amount of effort was
also associated with increasing importance attributed to the
Lifestyle-Limitations factor; r(300)=.21, p<.001, R2=.04; and
the Psychological factor, r(304)=.23, p<.001, R2=.05.
Similarly, the longer the amount of time spent actively
managing weight the greater importance attributed to the
Psychological factor, r(244)=.20, p=.002, R2=.04.1

Discussion
The aim of the current study was to explore the implicit
theories held about weight gain and how these vary
according to demographics and personal weight
management history. Five factors were obtained to explain
causes of weight gain. These were Lack-of-Self-Control,
Lifestyle-Limitations, Psychological, Biological/Medical,
and Modern-Living. Overall, the level of endorsement for
these factors indicated that they were recognized to some
degree as being important; however, the Lack-of-SelfControl factor was regarded as the most important in
causing weight gain. This factor reflects the
“commonsense” view of weight gain with its individual
focus of eating too much, not exercising enough, and being
lazy or lacking in self-control. The high importance
attributed to this factor is consistent with obesity studies in
which the most endorsed causes are those regarded to be
under individual control (Harvey, et al., 2002; J. Ogden &
Flanagan, 2008; Okonkwo & While, 2010).

The Modern-Living and Lifestyle-Limitations factors
recognized social and environmental changes that have
impacted on current lifestyles. The Modern-Living factor
incorporated recent increases in the use of technology such
as modern appliances, electronic entertainment, and cars as
well as the recent increase in availability and consumption
of “diet” foods. The Lifestyle-Limitations factor
acknowledged the contributions to weight gain through time
difficulties associated with long and/or irregular working
hours, high costs of healthy food relative to unhealthy foods
and lack of awareness of the effects of current lifestyle.
The final two factors of the current study reflected
individual level causes, but those generally recognized as
being outside of individual control. The Psychological
factor included the effects of emotional issues such as
depression and stress, as well as ageing on weight gain.
Hormonal and metabolic issues and medication effects were
expressed in the Biological/Medical factor.
The current study also examined how the beliefs about
weight gain varied according to demographics
characteristics. Females compared to males, regarded the
factors of Lifestyle-Limitations, Psychological, and
Biological/Medical as being more important in causing
weight gain. Increasing age was found to be associated with
increasing endorsement for the Modern-Living factor as a
cause. Unlike previous studies on obesity, no differences
were found according to SES or education level.
Some differences were found in the level of endorsement
for the causal attribution factors on the basis of location.
Those participants living in major cities rated Lack-of-SelfControl as less important compared to those living in innerregional areas. Those in major cities also rated ModernLiving of lower importance than did those living in regional
and remote areas. These differences may reflect differences
in lifestyle and/or limited resources/options available to
those living in regional areas of Australia. For example,
limited public transport services and centralization of
services in regional areas may have increased the reliance
on cars and other technologies leading to a greater
awareness of the impact of modern living amongst this
population.
The current study also sought to examine whether beliefs
about weight gain would be associated with the personal
experiences of weight management, with those who have
experienced unplanned weight gain and unsuccessful weight
management more likely to recognize the role of factors
involved in weight management that are outside the
individuals control than are those who have not experienced
such weight difficulties. However, endorsement of the
causal attribution factors did not differ on the basis of
whether or not one had experienced unplanned weight gain
or on whether one had actively managed their weight.
Current BMI was also not associated with the levels of
endorsement for any of the causal attribution factors.
Instead, this study found that greater time spent (in years)

These factors suffered skewness. These were transformed using
logarithms, inverses and SQRT as appropriate for statistical tests
with t and F statistics reported for transformed data.

managing weight was associated with more importance
being attributed to the Psychological factor. Greater effort
on weight management was also associated with higher
endorsement of the Lack-of-Self-Control, LifestyleLimitations, and Psychological factors. This suggests that
increased effort in weight management is associated with
increased recognition of a wider range of causes to weight
gain which can be both within and outside of the
individual‟s control. This is consistent with the findings
reported by Paxton and Sculthorpe (1999) in
overweight/obese women and by Greener et al. (2010) in
participants with an unsuccessful dieting history. Both of
these studies reported that these individuals attributed their
weight problem to personal short-comings but were also
aware of environmental pressures outside of the individual‟s
control. The current finding also suggests that the amount of
effort expended on weight management may provide a
better account of relevant weight history than actual weight
gain or loss.
The current findings suggest that, in general, the
community as a whole needs greater levels of education
about the contribution of factors outside the control of the
individual in causing weight gain. Educating the general
public of the multiple contributing factors to weight gain
would also lead to greater acceptance of population-level
strategies that are not specifically targeted towards those
who are already overweight or obese. This is particularly
relevant given the consistency between the current findings
about weight gain and beliefs about obesity reported in
previous studies.
It should be cautioned that the current findings do not
reflect causality. Other limitations of the current study
include unequal group sizes within the location, SES and
education categories which may have impacted on the
number of significant differences obtained. For example,
only 25% of the sample was male despite the researchers‟
efforts at recruiting more male participants. This study was
also based on self-report, possibly tapping into a socialdesirability bias. However, the anonymous nature of the
questionnaire should have assisted in reducing this bias.
