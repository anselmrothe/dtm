Abstract
In this paper, we investigated the process of interestingness
cognition in metaphor comprehension. We did this from the
point of view that the interestingness of a metaphor (e.g., “life
is like a gamble”) is related to its interpretative diversity. Two
studies were conducted to assess this phenomenon: Study 1
(interpretation-production) and Study 2 (interpretationpresentation study). In Study 1, we observed that a greater
number of interpretations were produced from a metaphor
that was interesting and easy to understand as compared to
one that was less interesting and difficult to understand. In
Study 2, we observed that a metaphor was more interesting
when more information on simile interpretation was presented.
On the basis of these results, we discuss the relationship
between the process of metaphor comprehension and
metaphor evaluation.
Keywords: metaphor/simile comprehension; interpretive
diversity; interestingness.

Introduction
Sentences such as “life is like a gamble” and “marriage is
like a refrigerator” include comparative senses. Such
sentences, consisting of a paired topic and vehicle, which
we refer to as a “metaphor” (strictly a “simile”), indicates
similar points between two words: life is like a gamble (both
unpredictable and implying risk) and marriage cools a
relationship or keeps it fresh, as does a refrigerator for its
contents. Similarity is very important for metaphor
comprehension. Recent studies have discussed similarity
cognition or the factors that affect similarity cognition in
metaphor comprehension. In fact, most studies discuss the
relationships between similarity cognition and the process
of metaphor comprehension (e.g., Gentner, 1983; Ortony,
1979; Tversky, 1977).

The Process of Metaphor Comprehension
Similarity cognition in metaphor comprehension is
described simply as “the similarity between the topic and
vehicle.” The question of similarity involves two forms of
nuance: the qualitative sense and the quantitative sense. As
illustrated in aptness views (e.g., Chiappe & Kennedy,
1999; Chiappe, Kennedy, & Smykowski, 2003; Jones &

Estes, 2006), the former refers to the degree (“goodness”
and “adequacy”) to which the topic and vehicle are similar.
As defined in Chiappe and Kennedy (2001), goodness and
adequacy indicate the extent to which a comparison captures
the important features of the topic. For example, gamble
includes features salient in, and applicable to, the nature of
life: in gambling’s sense of “unpredictability,” gamble
adequately represents an important aspect of life. Likewise,
both a refrigerator and marriage cool something, but
marriage is comparatively difficult to express with a
refrigerator. Previous studies have shown that this type of
similarity affects the process of metaphor comprehension.
Jones and Estes (2006) experimentally revealed that the
strength of metaphor aptness predicts metaphor/simile
preference, reading time for a metaphor, and the ease of
interpretation of a metaphor. An apt relationship between
the topic and vehicle creates a preferential metaphorical
(categorical) expression, is read faster, and is rated as easier
to understand than a less apt relationship.
According to the quantitative view, similarity cognition is
based on the number of features shared by both the topic
and the vehicle. If this number is large, similarity cognition
between the topic and vehicle is strong. In the process of
metaphor comprehension, these shared features are
generated as metaphor interpretation: the metaphor with the
most shared features is predicted to produce the most
interpretations. In previous studies, simulation results have
shown reliable evidence that the productivity of metaphor
interpretation, such as interpretative diversity (Utsumi &
Kuwabara, 2006; Utsumi, 2007), is more closely related to
the process of metaphor comprehension than to the
goodness of similarity (i.e., metaphor aptness). Thus, the
topic-vehicle
relationship
that
produces
several
interpretations is the preferred metaphor or simile.

The Process of Metaphor Evaluation
As described above, the similarity cognition of a metaphor
plays an important role in the process of metaphor
comprehension. On the other hand, some previous studies
have suggested that similarity cognition is also related to the
process of metaphor evaluation, such as the rhetoric effect
and how funny and interesting a metaphor is.

2381

A metaphor is understood through its cognitive effect,
which is not only the enhancement of word meaning
(Blasko & Connine, 1993; Gernsbacher, Keyser, Robertson,
& Werner, 2001; Taira & Kusumi, 2011) but also its
pragmatic effect (Sperber & Wilson, 1994). The former has
been revealed to be affected by the strength of the similarity
cognition, such as aptness (Blasko & Connine, 1993; Taira
& Kusumi, 2011); the latter appears to be related to
similarity cognition. For example, Roberts and Kreuz
(1994) show that all figurative expressions have some
discourse goal. Among them, a metaphor (e.g., “life is a
gamble”) and a simile (e.g., “life is like a gamble”) have
different pragmatic goals. One difference is that the simile is
used as a humorous expression, while the metaphor is not.
Previous studies have shown that the simile is a comparative
expression based on similarity cognition, unlike the
metaphor (Bowdle & Gentner, 2005; Jones & Estes, 2006)
so that similarity cognition is related to humor.
In consideration of the above, we examined the
relationship between the simile comprehension process and
its evaluation process in a previous study (Taira, Nakamoto,
& Kusumi, 2006). The aim of that study was to examine the
process of interestingness cognition through correlations
between factors affecting the process of simile
comprehension. We studied 75 undergraduate native
Japanese speakers and employed 30 Japanese similes (e.g.,
“life is like a gamble,” “marriage is like a refrigerator”).
Through a simple rating task, the ease of comprehension,
similarity, familiarity, unpredictability, and interestingness
of each simile were measured. In addition to these ratings,
the number of interpretations for each simile was collected
in another study where participants were required to write
out their interpretations of the simile.

The aim of our research
Our previous studies suggest that the similarity cognition of
a metaphor, especially quantitative similarity, is related not
only to the process of metaphor comprehension but also to
the process of metaphor evaluation (i.e., interestingness
cognition). However, such results are only suggested by
correlational data; it is unknown whether a metaphor that is
interesting and easy to understand really produces several
interpretations and whether metaphor interpretation directly
affects interestingness cognition. It is unclear whether the
interestingness of a metaphor is based on the metaphor’s
properties or an individual’s action. In this paper, we
investigated the process of interestingness cognition in
metaphor comprehension.
In Study 1, we examined the number of interpretations for
a simile. Our previous study did not reveal the process of
interpretation production in simile comprehension; thus, we
did not determine whether an individual could produce
several interpretations from a simile that is interesting and
easy to understand. In Study 1, we examined the number of
interpretations for various metaphors with different levels of
interestingness and ease of comprehension.
In Study 2, we examined whether the interpretation itself
increases the interestingness cognition. As in Study 1,
interestingness cognition is inferred through correlational
relationships. If this prediction is correct, a metaphor will be
judged more interesting when more interpretations of the
metaphor are presented. For Study 2, we provide
experimental data on the relationship between the
interpretation and the interestingness of metaphors.

Study 1

Correlations between the metaphor factors are shown in
Table 1, and the results of a path analysis based on the
correlation data are shown in Figure 1. The results indicate
that both similarity and familiarity, considered factors
related to similarity cognition (Chiappe & Kennedy, 2001),
are related directly to ease of comprehension. Furthermore,
the ease of comprehension and the number of interpretations
directly affect simile interestingness: the more easily the
simile is understood and the more interpretations the simile
produces, the simile is interpreted as more interesting.

The aim of Study 1 was to confirm that an individual
produces more interpretations for a more comprehensive
and interesting metaphor, and vice versa.

Method
Participants 800 participants were recruited from an
internet research company. All were native Japanese
speakers.
Materials Thirty-six Japanese similes were selected from
the materials used in Taira and Kusumi (2009); some were
also selected from materials used in our previous study

2382

(Taira, Nakamoto & Kusumi, 2006). For these similes, Taira
and Kusumi (2009) examined interestingness and ease of
comprehension using 5-point scales (1 = “not at all
interesting or easy to understand” to 5 = “very interesting or
easy to understand”). They were clustered within three
simile types: 12 similes that were seen as highly interesting
and very easy to understand (e.g., “life is like a gamble:”
interestingness, M = 3.21, ease of comprehension, M = 4.04),
12 similes seen as moderately interesting and easy to
understand (e.g., “a husband is like jewelry:” interestingness,
M = 2.81, ease of comprehension, M = 3.38), and 12 similes
seen as less interesting and difficult to understand (e.g.,
“marriage is like a refrigerator:” interestingness, M = 2.38,
ease of comprehension, M = 2.36). The correlation between
interestingness and ease of comprehension was very strong
(r (36) = .88). This result is similar to results obtained in
Taira, Nakamoto, and Kusumi (2006); thus, the material
selection in Study 1 was appropriate. In this paper, we
defined each type of simile within a high-, middle-, and
low-rating group.
Procedures This study was part of an omnibus internet
survey that measured higher-order literacy. The monitors
participated in the survey on the internet. They were
required to access the website described by the internet
research institute and to answer questions relevant to our
study. Three similes had been selected from each category.
Participants were required to provide as many
interpretations of each simile as possible. The
interpretations were typed into a textbox on the webpage.

mean data were analyzed through one-way ANOVAs with
participants (Fp) and items (Fi).
The main effect of rating group was significant (Fp(2,
1598) = 36.86, η2 = .02; Fi(2, 22) = 5.14, η2 = .24; ps < .001).
Multiple comparisons revealed significant differences
between the low and middle rating groups (t(1598) = 4.00, r
= .15), low and high rating groups (t(1598) = 8.58, r = .28),
and middle and high rating groups (t(1598) = 4.58, r = .16).
The results show that participants produced different
numbers of interpretations according to their ease of
comprehension and interestingness. This is somewhat
consistent with results from Taira, Nakamoto, and Kusumi
(2006). However, both ease of comprehension and
interestingness in Study 1 were defined through data from
our previous studies (Taira & Kusumi, 2009). Results from
Study 1 did not indicate whether participants really
conceived the metaphor as interesting and easy to
understand. This problem was addressed in Study 2.

Results and Discussion

Method

Between 57 and 86 participants produced interpretations for
each simile. Data were coded and clustered. Through this
procedure, the number of interpretation units for each simile
was examined. We defined an interpretation unit as the
component included within the participant’s text with an
independently important sense for the metaphor’s
interpretation. For example, if one participant produces the
interpretation “it is unpredictable and followed with any risk.
It does not describe what will happen next” for “life is like a
gamble,” two interpretation units are produced because the
second sentence includes the same unit that appears in the
first sentence.

Participants Fifty-four participants took part in Study 2.
All were native Japanese speakers and had not participated
in Study 1.
Materials From Study 1, the 12 similes that were defined
within the high-rating group (e.g., “life is like a gamble”)
and the 12 similes that were defined within the low-rating
group (e.g., “marriage is like a refrigerator”) were selected.
For each simile, three relevant simile features (e.g., for “life
is like a gamble,” “unpredictable,” “followed with any risk,”
and “needing strategy”) were applied. The three relevant
features were selected from the first, second, and third most
popular interpretation units produced in Study 1.
Procedure Study 2 was composed of three tasks: a rating
task, a reading span task (RST), and a re-rating task. These
tasks were performed in aforementioned order.
The rating task was a simple rating task in which
participants were required to rate the ease of comprehension,
interestingness, and unpredictability of the similes. Each
factor was rated on 7-point scales (1 = “very difficult to
understand,” “not at all interesting,” and “very predictable”
to 7 = “very easy to understand,” “very interesting,” and
“very unpredictable”).
For the RST, a standardized procedure of the Japanese
RST (Osaka & Osaka, 1994) was performed. For this task, 2
to 5 sentences with one word underlined were presented in
order; participants were required to read aloud each

There were strong correlations between the interpretation
unit and ease of comprehension (r(800) = .498) and
interestingness (r(800) = .404) in Taira and Kusumi (2009).
These results suggest that participants produced more
interpretations for similes that were more interesting and
easy to understand. In addition, the mean of the
interpretation unit per participant is shown in Table 2. The

Study 2
Study 1 revealed relationships between the ease of
comprehension/interestingness of a metaphor and its
number of interpretations. From these results, however, we
cannot ascertain whether interestingness cognition is
followed by metaphor interpretation or whether
interestingness cognition follows metaphor interpretation. In
Study 2, we controlled the number of metaphor
interpretations and investigated the effect of interpretation
on interestingness cognition.

and re-rating tasks.

The re-rating task was composed of three phases (see
Figure 2). During the first phase, three information units
were presented to participants. The information unit was
either the feature (e.g., “unpredictable,” “followed with any
risk,” or “needing strategy”) relevant to the simile (e.g.,
“life is like a gamble”) or a simple addition-subtraction
calculation formula (e.g., “2 + 4” or “1 - 5”). The
composition of the information units included three features
without a calculation formula, one feature and two
calculation formulas, and no features and three calculation
formulas. Participants were required to comprehend the
information units because they would perform a recall task
after this phase. During the second phase, participants were
required to rate the ease of comprehension, interestingness,
and unpredictability of the similes in the same manner as
during the rating task. Participants were instructed to re-rate
the similes based on their current impression (not based on
their previous rating). During the third phase, participants
were required to recall features and calculation formulas
learned during the first phase. After participants finished the
third phase, the next trial began. This task included 26 trials:
the first two were practice trials.

High-rating group’s results For the high-rating group, the
ease of comprehension score was very high, and a series of
2 (task type: rating/re-rating) x 3 (the number of feature:
0/1/3) repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed a significant
main effect of task type (F(1, 53) = 4.53, p < .005, η2 = .00)
but no main effect of the number of features (F(2, 106)
= .47, η2 = .00) or any interactions (F(2, 106) = .87, η2 = .00).
Likewise, ANOVAs were conducted on the interestingness
and unpredictability scores. The unpredictability result
revealed no significant main effects of task type (F(1, 53)
= .06, η2 = .00), the number of features (F(2, 106) = .51, η2
= .00), or any interactions (F(2, 106) = .51, η2 = .00). The

2384

result of interestingness also showed no significant main
effects of task type (F(1, 53) = .50, η2 = .00) and the number
of features (F(2, 106) = 2.96, p < .10, η2 = .01), and no
significant interaction (F(2, 106) = 1.48, η2 = .00).
If the prediction that metaphor interpretation directly
affects and increases interestingness cognition is correct, the
results from the high rating group suggest that the simile of
the high rating group originally produced several
interpretations (from Study 1); thus, the scores for each
rating task factor were the same as the scores in the re-rating
task where interpretations were presented.

9.46, p < .001, η2 = .04) in the ease of comprehension scores,
as well as a significant interaction (F(2, 106) = 15.05, p
< .001, η2 = .02). To deconstruct the interaction, Ryan’s
multiple comparisons test indicated simple main effects of
task type on both the 1-feature and 3-feature conditions
(Fs(1, 159) = 42.79, 63.04, ps <. 001, η2 = .06, .08). Simple
main effects of the number of features on the re-rating task
were also significant (F(2, 212) = 20.96, p < .001, η2 = .07):
in the re-rating task, the scores in both the 1-feature and 3feature conditions were higher than the 0-feature condition
(ts(106) = 2.59, 4.32, ps < .05, 001, r = .28, .40). On the
other hand, scores for the 3-feature condition were not
significantly higher than the 1-feature condition (t(106) =
2.08, r = .14).
For the interestingness scores, there were also significant
main effects of task type (F(1, 53) = 8.74, p < .005, η2 = .01)
and interactions (F(2, 106) = 3.39, p < .05, η2 = .01) but no
significant effects for the number of features (F(2, 106)
= .50, η2 = .00). Ryan’s multiple comparisons test also
indicated simple main effects of task type in both the 1feature and 3-feature conditions (Fs(1, 159) = 5.54, 10.62,
ps < .05, .005, η2 = .01, .02), but no simple main effect of
the number of features for the re-rating task (F(2, 212) =
2.58, p < .10, η2 = .01). Conversely, for the unpredictability
scores, there were no significant main effects (task type:
Fs(1, 53) = .51, η2 = .00; number of features: Fs(2, 106) =
1.06, η2 = .01), or interactions (Fs(2, 106) = 1.80, η2 = .00).
These results suggest that the presentation of metaphor
interpretation, which is related to similarity cognition,
affects the process of metaphor comprehension: the
interestingness of a metaphor might be increased through
interpretations. This is consistent with the prediction that
interpretative action significantly affects interestingness
cognition. Our results also confirm previous studies
suggesting that metaphor appreciation is based on the
resolution of incongruity (Utsumi, 2002: Utsumi, 2005).
However, the solution of unpredictability was not detected
by results from Study 2. One possible interpretation is that
unpredictability might be attributed not to the simile but to
the interpretation itself. The low-rating similes are generally
difficult to comprehend and produce its interpretations
(from Study 1) so that the presented interpretations in Study
2 can be also unexpected to the participants. If some
participants confounded this cognitive process with the task
judgment that required the evaluation of the simile itself,
results from the low-rating group are probable. This
problem needs to be addressed in future research by using
more strict instructions and experimental paradigms.

General Discussion

series of 2 (task type: rating/re-rating) x 3 (the number of

The current studies have provided experimental evidence of
metaphor comprehension/evaluation. Previous studies have
only revealed relationships between these constructs and
were unable to fully determine whether evaluation results
are based on the metaphors’ properties or individuals’ inner
processes.

2385

Our results suggest that metaphor evaluation is based on
interpretative action. Moreover, our results indicate that
metaphor comprehension is strongly affected by whether the
connection between two different concepts is discovered.
Thus, our results support the quantitative view of metaphor
comprehension (Utsumi, 2007). However, our results do not
fully discount the qualitative view given that the number of
interpretations observed depends on the context, the
saliency of interpretation, and an individual’s cognitive
ability. Our task paradigm, especially that of Study 2, shows
incongruence between the interpretation during the task and
the interpretation that the individual produces. We usually
produce metaphor interpretations when reading or listening
to them and unaided by any relevant information. We
typically are unable to refer to adequate interpretations, as
were participants in Study 2. In future research, we will
examine the relationship between metaphor interpretation
and metaphor evaluation through a task requiring
participants to produce interpretations of metaphors.
Previous studies have discussed the relationship between
the process of comprehension and an individual’s cognitive
ability, such as working memory (e.g., Chiappe & Chiappe,
2007; Pierce & Chiappe, 2009; Pierce, McLaren, & Chiappe,
2010). However, there are few studies examining the
relationship between evaluation processes, such as
interestingness, and working memory. Future research will
need to examine the working memory factor, which is
predicted to affect the process of both comprehension and
evaluation.
