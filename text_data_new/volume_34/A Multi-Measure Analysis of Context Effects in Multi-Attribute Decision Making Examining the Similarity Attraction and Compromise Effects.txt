Abstract
The similarity, attraction, and compromise effects warrant
specific investigation in multi-attribute decision making. To
examine these effects concurrently, we assigned 145
undergraduates to three context effect conditions. They were
requested to solve 20 hypothetical purchase problems that
had three alternatives described along two attribute
dimensions. We measured their choices, confidence ratings,
and response times. We found that adding the third alternative
had significant effects for choice proportions and confidence
ratings in all three conditions. The attraction effect was more
prominent than the other two effects with regard to choice
proportions. The compromise effect condition yielded low
confidence ratings and long response times, although the
choice proportion was high for the third alternative. These
results indicate that the mutual relationship among choice
proportions, confidence ratings, and reaction times requires
theoretical investigation.

Introduction
Theories of rational decision making suggest that choice is
intrinsically determined by the utilities of the individual
alternatives and thus unaffected by the relationships among
the alternatives in the choice context. However, many
studies have found violations of this tenet (Busemeyer,
Barkan, & Chaturvedi, 2007; Tsetsos, Usher, & Chater,
2010). Three much-studied findings regarding such
context-dependent choice effects warrant specific attention
since they constitute violations of axioms fundamental to
rational choice. The present paper collectively addresses
these effects because they share important commonalities
and can be explained using a unified framework. These
findings include the attraction, similarity, and compromise
effects.
These effects occur with the addition of a third alternative
(decoy) to the two-alternative choice set (Roe, Busemeyer,
& Townsend, 2001; Tsetsos et al., 2010; Tsuzuki & Guo,
2004; Usher & McClelland, 2004). Consistent with
established research, the present paper examines these
effects in a two-attribute form (see Figure 1). The
alternatives that constitute the core two-alternative set are

commonly referred to as the target and the competitor. The
target and the competitor form a trade-off—one is better
than the other on one attribute, but worse on the other
attribute. The third alternative is then added to this core set.
Depending on the relative position of the third alternative
with respect to the target, three types of phenomena are
likely to occur. Two arise when the third alternative is more
similar to the target than it is to the competitor. However, if
a trade-off exists between the third alternative and the target,
the choice probability of the target decreases relative to that
of the competitor. This is called the similarity effect
(Brenner, Rottenstreich, & Sood, 1999; Tversky, 1972). In
contrast, if the third alternative is inferior to the target on all
attributes, the choice probability of the target should
increase relative to that of the competitor. This is called the
attraction effect (Hedgcock & Rao, 2009; Huber, Payne, &
Puto, 1982).
The third phenomenon occurs when the third alternative
rests between the target and the competitor, in which case
the third alternative, now constituting a compromise
between the core items, would be chosen most often. This is
called the compromise effect (Mourali, Böckenholt, &
Laroche, 2007; Simonson, 1989). All three of these
phenomena constitute a violation of the axioms of rational
choice.
Numerous explanations have been provided for each of
the three kinds of decoy effects (Simonson & Tversky, 1992;
Tversky, 1972; Tversky & Simonson, 1993). However, Roe
et al. (2001) were the first to explain all three within a single
framework that was implemented in a connectionist model
derived from a previous stochastic mathematical theory
(Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993; Tsuzuki, Kawahara, &
Kusumi, 2002). Their model (the multi-alternative decision
field theory, MDFT) accounts for these findings specifically
with the aid of variable lateral inhibition, which is due to
similarity relations among alternatives and the momentary
shifting of attention from one attribute to another.
Tsetsos et al. (2010, p. 1280) remarked that “before we
start, we note that these effects (the similarity, attraction, and
compromise effects) were so far obtained in different studies,
so until a study reports all three effects with the same

materials, procedures, and subjects, there is the possibility
that more freedom exists if parameters (noise) can be
modified for various decoy effects.” Therefore, empirical
studies are needed to test if the three effects can be
replicated using the same experimental design and materials.
The present experiment focused on the functioning of all
three major context effects in multi-attribute, multialternative decision-making processes using the same
materials and procedures. This was done using valid choice
sets (hypothetical purchase problems) based on preliminary
research. In the three-choice session, participants made a
selection, gave confidence ratings for the alternatives, and
were measured for response times in 20 different choice sets.

developed 20 choice sets (see Appendix). Each set contained
alternatives from a single type of consumer product or
service and consisted of two core alternatives (the target and
the competitor) and a third alternative that was described on
two dimensions (see Figure 1). Across the 20 choice sets, the
average choice proportion for the target vs. the competitor
was 51.32 vs. 48.27; these two proportions were not
significantly different (n = 77, χ2 = 0.16, df = 1).
For the similarity effect condition, the third alternative
was created by lowering the value of the target on one of its
dimensions by one-fourth of the difference between the
target and the competitor and by raising the value of the
other dimension of the target by one-fourth of the difference
between the target and the competitor. For the attraction
effect condition, the third alternative was created by
lowering the values of the target on both its dimensions by
one-fourth of the difference between the target and the
competitor. Finally, for the compromise effect condition, the
third alternative was created by lowering the value of the
target on one of its dimensions by half of the difference
between the target and the competitor and by raising the
value of the other dimension of the target by half of the
difference between the target and the competitor. All
materials and instructions were presented using personal
computers.

Method
Participants and Design
One hundred and forty-five university undergraduates
participated in this experiment, for which they received
course credit. The basic design variables were (a) the type of
the third alternative (corresponding to the similarity,
attraction, or compromise effect), which was manipulated
between subjects and (b) the type of the alternative (target,
competitor, or a third alternative). The participants were
randomly assigned to the between-subjects conditions. For
the similarity, attraction, and compromise effect condition,
48, 49, and 48 undergraduates were assigned, respectively.
The presentation of choice sets was quasi-randomized for
each participant in each condition.

Materials and Apparatus
Based on the stimuli of previous studies (Okuda, 2003;
Pettibone & Wedell, 2000; Wedell & Pettibone, 1996), we
conducted four preliminary surveys and subsequently

Procedure
A session with three alternatives. Participants were
informed that they would be presented with many sets of
three alternatives (the target, the competitor, and the third
alternative), and that they would need to indicate their
preference for each set. Each choice set was represented by
three alternatives, each constructed using two values of
differing dimensions (see Figure 2). The arrangement of the
alternatives and dimensions on the screen was
quasi-randomized in each trial. Choice sets were presented

1055

on the screen and remained on the screen until the
preference choice was made. The reaction time between the
start of the presentation of the choice set and the choice
response was measured using a personal computer.
Following this, a confidence rating of the choice was
provided based on a 9-point scale.
A session with two alternatives. Participants performed a
similar experimental session using two alternatives (the
target and the competitor).

Results
Binary Choice Session
In the binary choice session, the average choice proportions
for the target vs. the competitor were 51.42 vs. 48.58 in the
similarity effect condition, 48.61 vs. 51.39 in the attraction
effect condition, and 51.42 vs. 48.58 in the compromise
effect condition. The two choice proportions were not
significantly different in any of the conditions ( χ2 = 0.54, df
= 1; χ2 = 0.53, df = 1; χ2 = 0.01, df = 1, in the similarity,
attraction, and compromise effect conditions, respectively).
These results confirm the equivalence of the binary choice
sets in this experiment as the baseline data.

The confidence rating scores were analyzed using a
two-way mixed model ANOVA (3 [type of context] × 3
[type of alternative]) with repeated measures (see Figure
4).The main effects of context type, F(2, 153.44) = 3.65, p
< .05, and alternative type, F(2, 215.91) = 15.60, p < .001,
and the interaction of the two factors, F(4, 205.99) = 7.63, p
< .001, were significant. The simple main effects of
alternative type were found to be significant in the similarity,
attraction, and compromise effect conditions (F(2, 2.99) =
15.23, p <.001; F(2, 29.83) = 4.49, p <.05; F(2, 61.11) =
26.02, p <.001).
A multiple comparison was performed on the three
conditions of alternative type. In the similarity effect
condition, the confidence rating for the third alternative was
significantly lower than those of the target and the
competitor (both ps < .001). In the attraction effect condition,
the confidence rating of the target was significantly higher
than that of the competitor, p< .05. In the compromise effect
condition, the confidence rating of the third alternative was
significantly lower than those of the target and competitor
(both ps < .001).

The arcsin transformed choice proportions were analyzed by
two-way ANOVA (3 [type of context] × 3 [type of
alternative]) with repeated measures (see Figure 3; Greer
and Dunlap [1997] demonstrated that ANOVAs are
applicable for the ipsative measures). Context type was a
between-subjects factor and alternative type was a
within-subjects factor.
The main effects of context type, F(2, 142) = 48.88, p
< .001, and alternative type, F(2, 284) = 55.45, p < .001, and
the interaction of the two factors, F(4, 284) = 80.33, p < .001
were significant. The simple main effects of alternative type
were significant in the similarity, attraction, and compromise
effect conditions (F(2, 426) = 5.74, p < .01; F(2, 426) =
129.20, p < .001; F(2, 426) = 105.68, p < .001, respectively).
A multiple comparison (Tukey’s WSD test) was
performed on the three conditions of alternative type. In the
similarity effect condition, the proportion of the competitor
was significantly higher than that of the target and third
alternative (both ps < .05). In the attraction effect condition,
the proportion of the target was significantly higher than
those of the competitor and third alternative (both ps < .01).
Furthermore, the proportion of the competitor choice was
significantly higher than that of the third alternative, p < .01.
In the compromise effect condition, the proportion of the
third alternative was significantly higher than that of the
competitor, p < .05. Overall, these results indicate that the
three kinds of decoy effects were replicated in the choice
proportions for each of the three context effect conditions.

In the similarity and attraction effect conditions, the
confidence rating scores were largely consistent with the
choice proportions. However, in the compromise effect
condition, the confidence rating scores were reversed in
magnitude relative to the choice proportions.

Reaction Time in the Three-Choice Session
Choice latencies more than 2 SD above the mean for each
subject were classified as errors and excluded from the RT
analysis. The log-transformed choice latencies were
analyzed in a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA
(three-alternative types) in each of the three context
conditions (see Figure 5).
Although the compromise effect condition yielded a

significant main effect, F(2, 93.87) = 4.58, p < .05, no such
significant effects were found for the similarity or attraction
conditions, F(2, 60.42) = 0.25 and F(2, 73.88) = 2.17,
respectively. For the compromise effect condition, a multiple
comparison performed on the alternative type indicated that
the decision time of the third alternative was significantly
longer than those of the target and competitor, (both ps
< .05). These results are consistent with those of the
confidence ratings.

was also based on inter-alternative similarity. According to
this model, the decision process is divided into two stages in
which the two most similar alternatives (i.e., the target and
the third alternative) are compared first, followed by the
incorporation of the competitor.
Despite its explanatory simplicity and consistency with
some established experimental data, the two-stage model
appears to be oversimplified for the purpose of describing
human behavior. Studies have demonstrated that in
multi-alternative choice tasks similar to those of the
similarity, attraction, and compromise effects mentioned
above, (1) people momentarily shift their attention across
pairwise comparisons and (2) similar pairs are compared
more frequently than dissimilar pairs (Russo & Rosen, 1975;
Satomura, Nakamura, & Sato, 1997).
Based on the data collected from these studies, Tsuzuki
and Guo (2004) proposed a stochastic comparison-grouping
model in which all possible types of comparisons are
performed momentarily using differential frequencies
(Figures 6, 7). In addition, while Guo and Holyoak’s model
uses a mathematical conversion to estimate choice
probabilities from the results of only one simulation,
Tsuzuki and Guo’s model runs a large number of simulations
in order to represent decisions across individuals, thereby
directly estimating choice probabilities (Table 1).
In contrast to this research, Usher and McClelland (2004)
offered an alternative to previous models that account for the
three major context effects simultaneously. Their model, the
leaky competing accumulator (LCA), shares many of the
same principles of the MDFT model but makes different
assumptions about loss aversion and the non-linear
activation function (Busemeyer, Townsend, Diederich, &
Barkan, 2005).

In the present experiment, significant effects of
manipulating the third alternative with respect to the
similarity, attraction, and compromise effects were found for
choice proportions, confidence ratings, and reaction times.
Specifically, we found significant effects for choice
proportions and confidence ratings in all three of these
context-effect conditions, with partially significant effects in
response time.
Furthermore, the attraction effect was more prominent
than the other two effects with regard to choice proportions.
The compromise effect condition yielded low confidence
ratings and long response times, although the choice
proportion of the third alternative was high. One possibility
is that for participants in the compromise effect condition,
one kind of selection effect happens for the participant
confidence rating for the third alternative in the context of a
trade-off or conflict with regard to the evaluation of both
attributes. In order to further test this conjecture, we have
begun experiments to study the role of eye movements in
multi-attribute, multi-alternative processes (Tsuzuki, Shirai,
Ohta, Matsui, & Honma, 2008).
Our experimental results support not only our stochastic
comparison-grouping model but also the other major models
of multi-attribute, multi-alternative choice processes. These
results indicate that the relationship between choice
proportions and confidence ratings requires theoretical
investigation (Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010), and also suggest
that further examination of process-tracing data is needed to
