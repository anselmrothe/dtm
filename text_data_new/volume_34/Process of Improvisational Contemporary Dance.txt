Abstract
The purpose of this study is to investigate the process of
improvisational contemporary dance. To achieve this goal, we
combine two types of methodology: analysis of data from
interviews with dancers and analysis of their dance
performances. Our findings reveal that while dancing, in
order to create their movements, improvisational dancers
interact with various stimuli that come from inside and
outside of themselves (for example, images and feelings that
they entertain during their dancing, and the music, space and
audience of their dance performances). Through such
interactions, dancers organize movements in their
performances extemporarily, using various expressive
techniques (for example, changing speed or image
intentionally and seeing themselves from the viewpoint of a
third person).
Keywords: Improvisation; Contemporary dance; Creativity

Introduction
What happens in artists’ minds when they generate their
expressions or works? Recently research interest in artistic
creation has been growing. There have been some empirical
studies in psychology and cognitive science focused on
artistic creation (e.g., Yokochi & Okada (2005) on Chinese
ink painting, Tsuchikura (2010) on movie making, Tayanagi
(2010) on jazz music, and Goan & Tujita (2007) on stage
direction). Of the various forms of art, this study seeks to
reveal the process of artistic creation empirically by
focusing on dance, in particular improvisational
contemporary dance.
Improvisation plays a critical role in the process of
artistic expression. Sasaki, a scholar of aesthetics, has
pointed out the importance of improvisation as follows: “In
the exact moment of their generation, expressions in the
artistic genres, such as fine arts, music, and drama are not
generated based on predetermined plans, but based on
impromptu activities” (Sasaki, 1995). Thus, it can be
considered that improvisation exists as an essential part of
the process of artistic expression.
Improvisational dance is one form of artistic expression
in which such a process of improvisation saliently appears.
Because improvisational dance presents audiences with the
process of dance creation itself, making dance movements
based on predetermined plans or repeating movements
during dance performance is meaningless. Therefore, the

process of improvisational dance contains the essence of
artistic creation and expression.
Previous studies in the domain of dance have pointed out
the importance of improvisation in the creation of dance
works, and the importance of impromptu expressions
themselves (Fukumoto, 2007; 2009; Hosokawa, 2011; De
Spain, 1997; Ribeiro & Fonseca, 2011; Soma & Hosokawa,
2007; Tsujimoto, 2010). Reviewing previous studies
focused on how historically eminent dancers used
improvisation to express themselves or create their dance
works, Tsujimoto (2010) emphasized the significance of
improvisation in dance. Tsujimoto (2010) also described an
anecdote that when dancing extemporarily, the dancer's
body instantly responded to stimuli from dance partners, the
surrounding environment, and sensations born within the
body. Through reviews of previous studies, Ribeiro &
Fonseca (2011) also reported dancers’ experience while
dancing extemporarily. They suggested that improvisational
dance is formed by “the interaction of the body with the
environment and the affective and cognitive systems”
(Ribeiro & Fonseca, 2011). Although these studies offer
useful insights, these findings are based on reviews and
anecdotal evidence, rather than on empirical evidence. They
did not empirically investigate what stimuli dancers interact
with in the process of improvisation or how dancers create
their works.
In contrast, using information from reviews of a dancer’s
works, interviews with her, and field experiments,
Hosokawa (2011) studied the process and skills of
improvisational dance, focusing on Kei Takei, a famous
contemporary dancer. On the basis of the results of the
study, Hosokawa (2011) suggests that Kei Takei generates
movement sequences intuitively based on her physical skill,
and polishes movement sequences to develop her dance
work in keeping with her dance philosophy. De Spain
(1997) constructed a theoretical model about the process of
solo dance improvisation through interviews and
introspective reports with improvisers of dance. De Spain’s
model broke down the elements of improvisation into the
categories
of
physical
operands/operators,
cognitive/affective operands/operators, determination, and
attention. “The model also emphasized the importance of
considering the existing state and flow of the improvisation
at the moment of new action/interaction” (De Spain, 1997).
Although Hosokawa (2011) and De Spain (1997) revealed

2073

the process of improvisational dance, these studies focused
only on the case of solo dance and their results are based
mainly on verbal evidence such as interviews. In order to
fully understand the process of improvisational dance in
reality, it is necessary for us to analyze dance performance
data in addition to interview data. Since the main medium
for dancers to express what they want to express is their
bodies, it is essential for researchers to analyze
improvisational dance performances to understand how such
a medium is used effectively. Therefore, we investigate the
process of improvisational contemporary dance combining
two types of methodology, analyses of data from interviews
with dancers, and analyses of their dance performances.
Hence, this exploratory study aims at empirically
investigating the improvisational process of contemporary
dance by solo and duo dancers. Specifically, this study
examines the relationship between dancers’ internal
processes and their dance performances, through: (1)
interviews with dancers about what they pay attention to

while improvising; (2) fieldwork analyses of actual dance
performances with introspective reports by the dancers.

Study 1 Interviews with Dancers
In this interview study, we investigate what dancers think
when they are dancing extemporarily.

Methods
Participants. Ten professional contemporary dancers who
have experience in improvisational dance participated in
this study. (We use aliases A to J for these participants.)
Procedure. We conducted semi-structured interviews with
the dancers about what they think when they are dancing
extemporarily. The interviews were held between August
and October 2010, with each interview lasting 90-120
minutes. All the interviews were recorded with a digital
audio recorder, and the first author additionally took notes.
We asked the dancers about what they were thinking and
what they valued when they were dancing extemporarily by

themselves and with other dancers. All the interviews were
conducted in Japanese.
Preparation for data analysis. We analyzed the data by
adapting the KJ method, a method to analyze the qualitative
data. In detail, using the following procedure, the recorded
interviews were prepared for analysis: 1. Transcription; 2.
General understanding of the contents; 3. Identification of
statements regarding attention or behaviour during
extemporary dance; 4. Labelling of the statements with
respect to dancers’ attention or behaviour during
extemporary dance; 5. Generation of categories by
gathering similar labels together; 6. Consideration of the
relationships between categories. We segmented the
statements based on the speakers’ turns, and coded all the
segmented units based on what the dancer paid attention to
while dancing extemporarily. In some cases, multiple codes
are used for a single unit. Later, we assembled categories
with similar meaning to create final categories.
During the coding process, several researchers and graduate
students majoring in cognitive science checked the validity
of the categories and revised inappropriate parts of labels
and categories made by the first author.

Results and Discussion
Table 1 is a collection of categories based on the interview
data relating to what dancers pay attention to while dancing
extemporarily. The statements were divided into three major
categories, [interaction with oneself], [interaction with the

outside] and [means of expression]. Additionally,
[interaction with oneself] was divided into <<internal
experience>> and <<physical experience>>. The categories
under <<internal experience>> are <message>, <feeling>
and <images>. The category under <<physical
experience>> is <physical sensation>. [Interaction with the
outside] includes <<stimuli from outside>>, <music>,
<space>, <audience> and <other dancers>. Topics
associated with [means of expression] include the following
three subcategories, <<confidence in oneself>>,
<<expressive techniques>> and <<personal decisions>>.
Subcategories under <<confidence in oneself>> are <trust in
inner experience>, <trust in physical experience>; those
under <<expressive techniques>> are <switching>,
<development>, <seeing oneself from the viewpoint of a
third person>, <coordination with other dancers>; those
under <<personal decisions>> are <choice> and
<continuation>. Table 2 shows which dancers referred to
each category. In improvisational dance, dancers first pay
attention to [interaction with oneself] and [interaction with
the outside] and then, using [means of expression], they
create a dance performance based on information from these
interactions. Thus, when a dancer is dancing extemporarily,
s/he interacts with factors such as <message>, <feeling>,
<images>, <physical sensation>, <music>, <space>,
<audience>, or <other dancers>. By combining this
interaction with <<confidence in oneself>>, s/he creates
physical movements as a dance performance.

Dancers choose such interactions flexibly by listening to
their feelings and responding to their surroundings. Dancers
continue the interaction that they chose until they are
satisfied with their own decisions. Thus, in improvisational
dance, dancers pay attention to many things that normally
go unnoticed (their own feelings, physical sensations, the
music, space, other dancers etc.) and they create dance
movements by responding carefully to these.
In order not to let the interaction cease and so to create
dance works that are fixed at a certain time and place,
dancers use expressive techniques, such as <switching>,
<development>, <seeing oneself from the viewpoint of a
third person> and <coordination with other dancers>.
Improvisational dancers present to audiences the process of
dance creation as a dance work. Therefore, in addition to
producing movements, it is also necessary to organize them
into dance pieces.
In other words, while dancing, in order to create their
dance, improvisational dancers interact with various stimuli
that come from inside and outside of themselves (for
example, images and feelings that they entertain during their
dancing, and the music, space and audiences of their dance
performances). Dancers use these interactions for their
expression by responding to them sincerely and carefully.
Through such interactions, dancers organize movements in
their performances extemporarily, using various expressive
techniques (for example, switching; changing speed or
image intentionally and seeing themselves from the
viewpoint of a third person).
The next important questions are how much interaction
occurs and with which kind of stimuli in improvisational
dance, and how these interactions affect the development of
dance. In order to answer these questions, Study 2 examines
dancers’ internal processes and behavioural processes
through introspective reports and analyses of performances.

Study 2 Field Experiment
What exactly do dancers think and feel while dancing in a
performance? In Study 2, we conducted a field experiment
to capture the relationship between the introspective reports
mentioned above and actual dance performances. The
analysis of reflection focuses on which stimuli dancers pay
attention to during the performance. Also, in the case of duo
dance performance, a dance partner is an additional stimulus
in the circumstance. We will analyze how a dance partner’s
movements affect the dancers’ movements in duo dance
performance.

Method
Participants and procedure. We conducted a field
experiment to analyze the improvisational dance
performance of two expert dancers (H and M, both with
more than 10 years of dance experience) on 5 November,
2010. After having them dance solo performances, we asked
them dance together. We recorded the performance with
four video cameras. Additionally, directly after the
performance, we showed the video of the performance to

the dancers and asked them to reflect on how they felt,
thought and moved during the performance.
The same music was used for both solo and duo
performances. The theme H chose for her dance was, “Did
you know that manifesto means to leave a handprint? To
leave a handprint”, and the theme M chose for his dance
was “Inside a framed picture”. H’s solo ran 4 minutes 18
seconds. M’s solo ran 4 minutes 17 seconds. Their duo
piece ran for 4 minutes 30 seconds. In the duo performance,
the dancers each maintained their own theme from their solo
work. The only difference this time was that they had to
dance with a partner who was expressing a different theme.
Preparation for data analysis.
Introspective reports: After transcribing the introspective
reports, we coded the statements based on what kind of
stimuli and interactions occurred using the categories from
Study 1.
Performance analysis: In order to objectively analyze the
dance performance, we first focused on the vertical change
of the centre of gravity of the dancers. Specifically, we
coded each video frame (30 frames = 1 second) focused on
the centre of gravity (1 lying down, 2 sitting, 3 kneeling, 4
standing, 5 stretching up, 6 jumping). We calculated the
average score for the change in the centre of gravity, by
dividing the score for the successive changes by the total
time (in seconds).

Results and Discussion
Introspective reports. After transcribing all of the
introspective reports, we identified the contents of the
performances that the verbal reports indicated. Then we
identified which stimuli the dancers interacted with. We
coded the data according to the categories used in Study 1.
Because it was difficult to distinguish between “images”
and “message”, we coded the statements relating to both of
these terms as “theme”. Therefore, the categories for the
statements are “theme”, “physical sensation”, “feeling”,
“dance technique”, “music”, “other dancers”, “audience”,
and “space”. Figure 1 shows how the objects of the dancers’
attention change throughout the performance second by
second. The columns in Figure 1 indicate “oneself”
(“theme”, “physical sensation”, “feeling”, “dance
technique”) and “outside” (“music”, “audiences”, “space”)
in the case of solo performance and “oneself” (“theme”,
“physical sensation”, “feeling”, “dance technique”), “other
dancer”, and “other factors” (“music”, “audience”, “space”)
in the case of duo performance.
The results show that H paid attention to “theme” in 81%
of the solo performance time, and M did so in 86%.
Therefore, it is clear that among the various stimuli,
interaction with “theme” plays a central role in the
development of the solo performance. Meanwhile, in duo
performance, 80% of H’s performance and 94% of M’s
performance were focused on the “other dancer”, indicating
that attention to the “other dancer” plays a central role in the
development of the duo performance.

Performance Analysis. The music used in this performance
was composed in such a way as to be easily split into three
distinct sections. Therefore, by dividing the overall
performance into three sections, we checked the change in
the dancers’ centre of gravity. The first section of the music
(therefore the first section of the dance performance) took
64 seconds and the second took 95 seconds. The third
section of the dance performance was determined by the
time when the dancers finished the dance. The third section
of H’s solo took 99 seconds, and M’s took 98 seconds. That
of the duo performance took 111 seconds. The results of the
centre of gravity analysis are shown in Table 3.
During the first section of the duo performance, the
dancers somewhat adjusted their own movements to their
partner’s. H’s score for the change in the centre of the
gravity was higher (1.03) in the solo performance, and
became lower (0.83) in the duo performance. M’s score
changed in the opposite direction (from 0.19 to 0.69). This
result is consistent with the introspective data. According to
the introspective reports, when paying attention to the dance
partner, dancers sometimes adjusted their dance movements
to the partner's and sometimes created a contrast during the
first section.
In the second section, the two dancers’ scores for the
centre of the gravity were similar (0.47 for H and 0.57 for
M). The introspective report is consistent with this finding

2077

in the sense that both dancers thought that they were
following their partner’s movements. There was also little
difference in the scores between solo and duo performances,
which may be attributed to the slow music in this section.
In the third section, H’s score was 0.82, while M’s was
0.40. In the introspective report, each of the dancers stated
that they had focused on the stimuli that s/he wanted to
interact with, while paying attention to her/his dance partner.
In particular, H was more influenced by the interaction with
the music and the audience, while M interacted more with
his own feelings. The fact that both of the dancers were
concentrating on their own dance in this section seems to
explain the difference between the dancers’ scores.
These results suggest that dancers’ dance movements in
the duo performance are affected by the interaction with the
other dancer’s movements, as well as other stimuli such as
their own feelings and music.

General Discussion
In this study, based on interviews and introspective reports,
we find that dancers take interactions with various stimuli
seriously when improvising dance. Paying attention mainly
to their own theme in solo performance and to the other
dancers in duo performance, dancers use expressive
techniques to construct an improvisational dance
performance. In addition, from the performance analysis in
Study 2, we find that dancing with another dancer changes a
dancer's movements. From the data on changes in the centre
of gravity, it is shown that other stimuli also affect the dance
performance.
These findings are consistent with the claim by dance
scholars Tsujimoto (2010) and Amagasaki (2004) that when
dancing extemporarily, the dancer's body instantly responds
to stimuli from dance partners, the surrounding environment
and sensations born within the body. This study offers
empirical evidence for such an anecdotal statement. In other
words, through analyses of both verbal and performance
data, this study reveals dancers’ interaction with the internal
process and the external environment in actual solo and duo
performances.
This research also reveals that dancers use various
expressive techniques to organize their dance movements as
a dance piece. These findings are consistent with the claim
by the dance scholar, Hosokawa (2011). However, this
study offers concrete examples of these expressive
techniques. Since there have not hitherto been any empirical
studies focused on improvisational dance, our research
makes a contribution to this field of research. Our findings
suggest that new artistic expressions beyond a dancer's own
repertory are born through interactions with the various
stimuli at the actual moment of creation.

Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to all the participants
for having spent so much time on the interviews and
dancing. We also received many insightful suggestions from

them on this research through discussions on dance and
through dancing together.
