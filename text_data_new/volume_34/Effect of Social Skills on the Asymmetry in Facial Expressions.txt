Abstract
This study investigated the effect of social skills on the facial
movement asymmetry in facial expressions. Threedimensional facial landmark data of facial expressions
(neutral, happy, and angry) were obtained from Japanese
participants (n = 62). After the facial expression task, each
participant completed KiSS-18 (Kikuchi’s Scale of Social
Skills; Kikuchi, 2007). Through a generalized Procrustes
method, facial landmark coordinates and their mirror-reversed
versions were represented as points on a hyperplane. The
asymmetry of each face was defined as Euclidian distance on
the plane. Subtraction of the asymmetry level of a neutral face
of each individual from the asymmetry level of a target
emotion face was defined as the index of “movement
asymmetry” of each emotion. Correlation coefficients of
Kiss-18 scores and movement asymmetry scores were
computed for both happy and angry expressions. Significant
negative correlations between Kiss-18 scores and movement
asymmetries were found for both expressions. The results
indicate that symmetric facial expressions are higher with
higher level of social skills.
Keywords: facial expression; facial asymmetry; social skills;
landmark-based 3D shape analysis.

Introduction
Facial expressions provide various signals for social
interactions. Although human faces and facial expressions
are somewhat symmetrical, numerous studies have focused
on facial bilateral symmetry: the degree to which one half of
a face is similar to the other half. Facial asymmetry derives
from two sources: structural asymmetry and movement
asymmetry (Schmidt, Liu & Cohn, 2006). Structural
asymmetry derives from physical variation in laterality of
facial structure, while movement asymmetry derives from
lateralized facial muscle movement during facial
expressions. In this study, we focused on movement
asymmetry in creating emotional expressions.

The primary source of facial movement asymmetry is
brain lateralization in emotion processing. Several studies
have shown that emotions are expressed more intensely in
the left hemiface (Sackeim, Gur & Saucy, 1978; Borod,
Haywood & Koff, 1997), because most facial muscles,
particularly those in the lower part, are innervated by the
contralateral hemisphere (Borod, 1993). Thus the
dominance of the left hemiface in facial expressions has
been interpreted as supporting the hypothesis of brain
lateralization of emotional processing (Schwartz, Davidson
& Maer, 1975; Sackeim, Greenberg, Weiman, Gur,
Hungerbuhler & Geschwind, 1982). More recent studies
have asserted that both hemispheres process emotion, but
each hemisphere is specialized for particular types of
emotion(Fusar-Poli, Placentino, Carletti, Allen, Landi,
Abbamonte, Barale, Perez, McGuire & Politi, 2009) such as
positive-negative emotion (Davidson, 1992; Gur, Skolnick
& Gur, 1994), or approach-withdrawal (Davidson, 1999).
While the laterality in facial expressions, human face
perception mostly relies on facial information contained in
the right hemiface (Gilbert & Bakan, 1973; Grega, Sackeim,
Sanchez, Cohen & Hough, 1988, Kanwisher, McDermott &
Chun, 1997; Sergent, Ohta & MacDonald, 1992). When
asked to judge the facial expression of a briefly presented
chimeric face image, perceivers tend to base their decision
more frequently on the expression contained within the right
side of the face, i.e., the left hemiface for the viewer. Thus,
the lateralization in facial expressions can lead to failure in
conveying the face’s real emotions to an observer. Although
the role of asymmetry of facial expressions in social
interactions is still unclear, asymmetric facial expression is
possibly an important variable. Facial asymmetry has been
proposed as a signal of developmental stability that can
indicate mate quality (Grammer & Thornhill, 1994; Kowner,
1996; Penton-Voak, Jones, Little, Baker, Tiddeman, Burt &
Perrett, 2001). In general, the less asymmetric a face is, the
more attractive it appears (Grammer, Fink, Moller &

1822

Thornhill, 2003; Grammer & Thornhill, 1994). This
asymmetry is believed to reflect past developmental stresses
and to be related to the likely quality of the individual as a
potential mating partner (Fink, 2004). Such preference for
symmetry may also extend to the preference for movement
symmetry.
This study investigates the relationship between social
skills and facial movement asymmetry in emotional
expressions. Social skills are generally defined as the set of
skills that enable a person to interact and communicate with
others in verbal and nonverbal forms of communication. If
higher social skills are related to more symmetrical facial
movements in emotional expressions, symmetrical facial
expressions can be considered an appropriate approach to
present the face owner’s emotions to receivers in social
interactions.

Facial Shape Measurement
Thirty-six facial landmarks were selected on the basis of
our previous studies (Kamide, Komori, Kawamura &
Nagaoka, 2011; Figure1, Table 1). All 3D coordinates of
the landmarks were visually measured using a computer
program (Rapid Form 2004: INUS Technology) by
referring to each of the 3D shape data and texture.

Method
Facial Expression Task
Japanese undergraduate and graduate students (n = 62: 20
men and 42 women; age: 19 to 26 years, mean age = 21.3,
SD = 1.37) provided three-dimensional facial shape data of
neutral, happy, and angry expressions. First, the participants
were instructed to show and maintain a neutral facial
expression. Then, they were asked to recall their
experiences in which they had felt the target emotions
(happy or angry) and to describe the experience after taking
each 3D image. The participants were not instructed to pose
or maintain any expression of target emotion. The order of
target emotions was counterbalanced among the participants.
Three-dimensional (3D) shapes and textures of facial
expressions of each face were captured using a 3D picture
measurement device (TRiDY-S: JFE Techno-Research
Corp.) based on pattern-projection method.

Assessment of Participants’ Social Skill
After the facial expression task, each participant completed
KiSS-18 (Kikuchi’s Scale of Social Skills; Kikuchi, 2007),
an 18-item self-report measurement of social skills with
higher scores indicating high level of social skills. This
scale is based on six categories of social skills proposed by
Goldstein (1980); basic skills, advanced skills, emotional
management skills, stress management skills, offence
management skills and planning skills. Basic skills include
‘talking with others’, ‘maintaining a conversation’ and
‘introducing oneself’. Advanced skills include ‘asking for
help’, ‘giving instructions’, ‘obeying instructions’,
‘apologizing’ and ‘persuading’. Emotional management
skills include ‘managing fear’, ‘emotional expression’ and
‘managing others’ anger’. Stress management skills include
‘managing criticism’ and ‘managing a contradiction in
message’. Offence management skills include ‘helping
others’, ‘conflict resolution’ and ‘managing trouble’.
Planning skills include ‘staying on target’ and ‘taking
initiative’. The scale has demonstrated high reliability and
validity in previous studies (Kikuchi 2007).

were translated into the same origin (centroid) and scaled to
the unit centroid size, which is the sum of the squared
distances from the centroid to each landmark. For alignment
of orientation, rotations around the centroid of the faces
were performed (Dryden & Mardia, 1998) such that the sum
of the squared distances among corresponding landmarks
between samples was minimized. Using the GPA, each
facial shape was represented as a point on a linear tangent
hyperplane of 108 dimensions (36 × 3), which allowed us to
treat the faces as multidimensional, normally distributed
values.
The “Shapes” statistical package written by Dryden and
Mardia (1998), which runs in an R statistical analysis
environment, was employed for the analyses. In addition to
the coordinates of 62 facial shapes, the mirror-reversed
versions of the same faces were used in the facial shape
analysis.

FACE

Figure 2: Schematic illustration of asymmetry. Each facial
shape and its mirror-reversed version are represented as
points on the tangent hyperplane. Only two axes are
represented for ease of illustration. The “consensus face” is
the origin of the space. Asymmetry is defined as the
Euclidean distance from each original version to the mirrorreversed version.

Facial Shape Standardization
Each face differed in location, size, and orientation. To
standardize them, we performed a generalized Procrustes
analysis (GPA) on the facial landmarks of all faces
irrespective of the gender of the face. A GPA is an
analytical method used for multivariate statistical analysis of
landmark locations expressed in Cartesian coordinates. This
method preserves information about the relative spatial
relationships of landmarks throughout the standardization,
and that has recently been applied to psychological research
on human faces (Komori, Kawamura & Ishihara, 2009,
2011).
For the standardization of location and size, we used the
centroid size technique (Bookstein, 1991). All facial shapes

Through a generalized Procrustes method, each of the facial
shapes and their mirror-reversed versions were represented
as a point on the tangent hyperplane. We defined asymmetry
(the converse of symmetry) of each facial shape as the
Euclidean distance between the face and its mirror-reversed
face on the hyperplane (Figure 2), according to our previous
study (Komori, Kawamura & Ishihara, 2009). Furthermore,
all original faces and their mirror-reversed faces were
combined to create a consensus face. This was the average
of all facial shapes and represented the origin of the tangent
hyperplane. The distance from a given original face to the
origin was the same as that from its mirror image to the
origin. This distance can be regarded as an index of facial
distinctiveness (the converse of facial averageness).
Therefore, asymmetry and distinctiveness can be measured
independently through this procedure; in other words, facial
variations can be separated into distinctiveness and
asymmetry.

Calculation of Local Asymmetry
To investigate the degree of asymmetry in each facial part,
such as eyebrows, eyes, and mouth, facial subspaces were
constructed from the standardized landmark coordinates of
eyebrows (from No. 4 to No. 12 of Table 1), eyes (from No.
15 to No. 22), and mouth (from No. 29 to No. 34).
Asymmetry in each part of a face was defined as the
Euclidian distance from the original version to the mirrorreversed version of each part in each subspace.

Results
Social Skill Score
Some studies have reported that males and females differ in
facial shape (Little, Jones, Waitt, Tiddeman, Feinberg,
Perrett, Apicella & Marlowe, 2008) and facial muscle
reactivity (Dimberg & Lundquist, 1990). It is possible that
gender differences in social skills could be a potential
confound in the analysis of the relationships between social

1824

skills and facial expressions. However, the Kiss-18 scores
were not significantly different between males and females
(t(60) = −.57, p = .57).

facial expressions on the asymmetry in mouth shape was
found (F(2,122) = 4.10, p = .019). However, there was no
effect of facial expressions on the asymmetries in eyebrows
or eyes (eyebrows: F(2,122) = .06, p = .94; eyes: F(2,122)
= .16, p = .21).

Facial Asymmetry

MEAN ASYMMETRY LEVEL

The mean morphological asymmetry in each facial
expression is shown in Figure 3. To examine the
relationship between facial expressions (neutral, happy, and
angry) and facial asymmetry levels, we conducted repeated
measures ANOVA with facial asymmetry levels as the
dependent variable. There was no significant effect of facial
expression on the facial asymmetry levels (F(2,122) = .36, p
= .72).Local Asymmetries
The local asymmetries were calculated for eyebrows, eyes,
and mouth (Figure 4). A repeated measures ANOVA was
performed for each facial part, and a significant effect of

Since there was no significant correlation between the Kiss18 scores and facial asymmetry levels of neutral expression,
facial structural asymmetry is considered potentially
unrelated to social skills (r = .20, p = .13). Thus, the
subtraction of the asymmetry level of a neutral face of each
individual from the asymmetry level of a target emotional
face can be defined as the index of movement asymmetry
that derives from facial muscle movement. Here we refer to
the value as the “movement asymmetry score.”
To assess whether higher social skills are linked to facial
movement asymmetry, correlation coefficients of the Kiss18 scores and movement asymmetry scores were computed
for both happy and angry expressions. Figure 5 shows the
relationship between social skills and movement
asymmetries. There was a significant negative correlation
between the Kiss-18 scores and movement asymmetries for
both expressions (happiness: r = −.30, p = .017; angry: r =
−.30, p = .018), indicating that the higher a participant
scored on the social skills test, the more symmetric their
facial expressions were.
The partial correlation coefficients between social skills
and movement asymmetries, using gender of the
participants as control variables, were also significant for
both expressions (happiness: r = −.30, p = .015; angry: r =
−.30, p = .017). This suggests that the relationship between
facial movement asymmetry and social skills was not
caused by the gender differences in social skills.

The correlation coefficient of the Kiss-18 score and
movement asymmetry in each facial part was calculated for
each target emotion. For a happy expression, movement
asymmetry of none of the parts was significantly correlated
with social skills (eyebrows: r = −.16, p = .21; eyes: r =
−.13, p = .33; mouth: r = −.02, p = .89). On the other hand,
for an angry expression, only movement asymmetry of
mouth was found to be negatively correlated with social
skills (eyebrows: r = .03, p = .82; eyes: r = −.17, p = .19;
mouth: r = −.26, p = .04).

Discussion
This study provides evidence that facial movement
asymmetry in emotional expressions is linked to low social
skills. Some studies have shown that a spontaneous smile is
symmetrical, but a posed (voluntary) smile is asymmetrical
(Gazzaniga & Smylie, 1990; Frank, Ekman & Friesen,
1993), suggesting a possibility that symmetrical facial
expression is recognized as spontaneous facial expression
derived from the facial owner’s emotion. In fact, Ozono,
Watabe, Yoshikawa, Nakashima, Rule, Ambady & Adams
(2010) have reported that Japanese participants rated faces
with greater smile symmetry as more trustworthy. Thus, the
results of this study may reflect the connection between
symmetrical facial expressions and trustworthiness.
The results also show that the relationship between low
social skills and facial movement asymmetry is especially
observed in the lower face region. Neurologically,
movements of the lower face region follows voluntary
muscle control, while upper face area movements follow
automatic control (Rinn, 1994; Gazzaniga & Smylie, 1990).
It is possible that the different effect of social skills on the
asymmetry in the upper or lower facial areas is caused by
such differential motor control.
The results of the study also suggest that the asymmetry
quantification method of this study is an effective method
for evaluating 3D facial asymmetry.
