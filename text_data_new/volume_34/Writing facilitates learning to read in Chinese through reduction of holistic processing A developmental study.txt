Abstract
Holistic processing has been identified as an expertise marker of
face and object recognition. In contrast, the expertise marker of
recognizing Chinese characters is reduced holistic processing
(Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009), which is driven by Chinese writing
experiences rather than reading ability (Tso, Au, & Hsiao, 2011).
Here we investigate the developmental trend of holistic processing
in Chinese character recognition and its relationship with reading
and writing abilities by testing Chinese children who were learning
Chinese at a public elementary school in Hong Kong on these
abilities. We found that the holistic processing effect of Chinese
characters in children was reduced as they reached higher grades;
this reduction was driven by enhanced Chinese literacy rather than
age. In addition, we found that writing performance predicts reading
performance through reduced holistic processing as a mediator. We
thus argue that writing hones analytic processing, which is essential
for Chinese character recognition, and in turn facilitates learning to
read in Chinese.

Introduction
Holistic processing (HP)—the ability to process separate
features as a single whole unit—is an expertise marker for
face and object recognition (see e.g., Bukach, Gauthier, &
Tarr, 2006; Gauthier & Bukach, 2007; Richler, Wong, &
Gauthier, 2011; though some argue that it is specific to faces,
e.g, McKone, Kanwisher, & Duchaine, 2007). Chinese
characters share many visual properties with faces. In
contrast to words in most alphabetic languages that are linear
in structure and consist of letter series of varying length, the
Chinese writing system is logographic—The configuration
of Chinese characters is more homogenous and square, and
each character is a grapheme that represents a morpheme
(Shu, 2003; Wong & Gauthier, 2006). The basic units of a
Chinese character are strokes that combine to create more
than a thousand different stroke patterns in the Chinese
writing system; these stroke patterns form the characters
(Hsiao & Shillock, 2006). A typical literate recognizes more
than 3,000 individual Chinese characters regardless of
variations in font (Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009). This is similar to
face recognition in which faces are recognized individually
regardless of variations in facial expressions (Hsiao &
Cottrell, 2009; Wong & Gauthier, 2006). Despite the
similarity between Chinese characters and faces, the
expertise marker for Chinese character recognition is reduced
HP (Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009).

Experienced Chinese readers employ less HP than novices
in perceiving Chinese characters; this may be because
Chinese readers are more sensitive to the internal constituent
components of Chinese characters. They can readily ignore
some configural information, such as exact distances
between features, which are unimportant for character
recognition (Ge, Wang, McGleery, & Lee, 2006). In contrast,
these internal constituent components may not look easily
separable to novices as they are less able to distinguish
individual features and components in Chinese characters
(Chen, Allport, & Marshall, 1996; Ho, Ng, & Ng, 2003;
Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009). In addition, reduced holistic
processing (i.e., analytic processing) of Chinese characters is
enhanced by Chinese writing experiences (Tso, Au, & Hsiao,
2011). In Tso and colleagues’ (2011) study, two groups of
Chinese readers were tested: Chinese literates who could
read and write (i.e., Writers), and Chinese literates who had
limited writing exposure and thus had reading performance
far better than writing performance (i.e., Limited-writers).
Limited-writers had reading performance comparable to
Writers’, yet Limited-writers had far poorer performance
than Writers in a dictation task (i.e., recall and write down a
Chinese word when instructed). Writers perceived Chinese
characters less holistically than Limited-writers—this
between-group difference in HP could mainly be explained
by dictation (writing) performance when the reading and
copying variables were statistically controlled.
In Hong Kong, elementary schools do not explicitly place
emphasis in its curriculum on teaching the Chinese character
radicals (i.e., character components that consist of one or
more identifiable stroke patterns); yet, children become more
aware of the internal orthographic components in Chinese
characters as they progress to higher grades (Ho et al., 2003).
This may be explained by motor programming through
extensive copying and writing as a requirement in Chinese
lessons at school (Guan, Liu, Chan, Ye, & Perfetti, 2011; Tan,
Spinks, Eden, Perfetti, & Siok, 2005). Reading performance
is significantly predicted by copying ability (Chan, Ho,
Tsang, Lee, & Chung, 2006; McBride-Chang, Chung, &
Tong, 2011; Tan et al., 2005), as well as dictation
performance (McBride-Chang et al., 2011; Tse, Kwan, & Ho,
2010). Writing experience may enhance reading ability
because children may consolidate knowledge of
graphomotor memory of character strokes as they copy the
stroke patterns (Tan et al., 2005; Tse et al., 2010). Learning to
write was experimentally shown to strengthen Chinese

2463

character recognition (Guan et al., 2011). Neuroimaging
studies also suggested that writing experience plays an
important role in shaping reading-specialized neural
representations (James & Atwood, 2009; Longcamp, Anton,
Roth, & Velay, 2003; Siok, Perfetti, Jin, & Tan, 2004). All
these results suggest a close relationship between
sensory-motor integration development through writing
practice and the development of reading skills, particularly
for recognizing Chinese characters.
Although previous studies have suggested a close
relationship between Chinese writing and reading
performance in children, the underlying mechanism remains
unclear (e.g., Guan et al., 2011; McBride-Chang et al., 2011)1.
As reduction in HP of Chinese characters marks expert-level
character recognition, here we hypothesize that writing
experience enhances character recognition performance by
modulating the perceptual system, allowing readers to
identify Chinese characters more analytically (Tso et al.,
2011). The modulating effect of writing experience on our
perception of Chinese characters has never been studied
before in Children who are learning to read and write Chinese
characters. Here, we investigate whether children in upper
grades perceived characters less holistically than children in
lower grades in an elementary school where the Chinese
language is taught. We also examine their Chinese reading
and writing performance to see what can predict Children’s
reduced HP of Chinese characters. We predict that
upper-grade children (who should have better Chinese
literacy than lower-grade children) will process Chinese
characters more analytically (i.e., less holistically) than
children in lower grades. Because of the direct relationship
writing experiences have with reduced HP (Tso et al., 2011),
we hypothesize that children’s reduction in HP can be
predicted by writing performances across grades. Since
writing performance also strongly correlates with reading
abilities in Chinese (see e.g., Guan et al., 2011;
McBride-Chang et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2005), we
hypothesize that HP mediates between Chinese reading and
writing abilities in children. More specifically, we predict
that writing experience leads to reduced holistic processing
in Chinese characters, which in turn enhances reading
abilities in Chinese (Fig. 1)
Tso and colleagues (2011) also suggested that writing
experience may facilitate reading Chinese characters in an
unfamiliar font, as Limited-writers had difficulty reading
words in the Feng font (a font that mimics handwriting and
was unfamiliar to the participants) whereas this effect in
Writers was minimal. Hence here we also examine the
possible effect of enhanced Chinese writing proficiency on
naming characters and words in familiar and unfamiliar
fonts.

holistic processing between Chinese writing
and reading performance.
Methods
Participants
56 first grade (mean age = 5.88 years, SE = .051), 73 third
grade (mean age = 7.90, SE = .056), and 88 fifth grade (mean
age = 9.89, SE = .047) Chinese children from an elementary
in Hong Kong participated in our study. They were all
Cantonese native-speaking and were all receiving regular
Chinese language curriculum at school. All of them had
normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Procedures
Test for holistic processing
To test for HP effects, we adopted procedures from Hsiao
and Cottrell (2009). 160 pairs of medium to high frequency
Chinese characters in Ming font were chosen; 80 pairs had a
top-bottom configuration and 80 pairs had a left-right
configuration 2 (Fig. 2). The frequency information of the
Chinese characters was obtained from Ho and Kwan (2001).
The top-down and left-right characters were matched in
stroke number and frequency. In each trial, children were
presented with two characters and instructed to attend to only
half (either top or bottom for top-bottom characters, or left or
right for left-right characters) of each character and judge
whether they were the same or different. Forty pairs were
presented in each of the four conditions (Fig. 3a): same in
congruent trials, different in congruent trials, same in
incongruent trials, and different in incongruent trials. The
complete composite paradigm (Gauthier & Bukach, 2007)
was adopted so that in congruent trials, the attended and
irrelevant halves corresponded to the same response (i.e.,
both were the same or different) while in incongruent trials,
the attended and irrelevant halves corresponded to different
responses (e.g., the top halves were the same while the
bottom halves were different). We adopted this paradigm to
avoid response biases that may occur in the partial composite
design in which the irrelevant halves would always be

left-right configuration (left) and top-bottom
configuration (right).
different (see Gauthier & Bukach, 2007; Robbins & McKone,
2007; Richler, Cheung, & Gauthier, 2011).

Although some studies have proposed that writing enhances
graphomotor memory of Chinese characters, which in turn
facilitates reading (e.g., Tan et al., 2005; Tse et al., 2010). Yet, this
hypothesis has not been statistically tested.

Both left-right and top-bottom are common Chinese character
structures. Left-right is a more dominant structure than top-bottom
in the Chinese lexicon.

In each trial, after 1,000 ms of central fixation, participants
were cued with a symbol that indicated which half of each
character they should attend to. The pair of characters was
then presented, with one above and one below the initial
fixation point, followed by a mask. During the 500ms
presentation time, children looked at each character once and
responded as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing
corresponding buttons to judge if the character parts were the
same or different (Fig 3b). Accuracy was collected. We
measured participants’ discrimination sensitivity A' as:

H and F are the hit rate and false alarm rate, respectively. A' is
a bias-free nonparametric measure of sensitivity; we did not
use d' because response biases may affect its measurement
when assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance
are not met (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999). The A' difference
between incongruent and congruent trials (i.e., Holistic A')
measures HP—a more positive value marks a stronger HP
effect.

Reading tests:
1. Character naming task:
Children were presented with 60 Chinese characters one at a
time. Half of the stimuli were presented in Ming font (a
commonly used font type; Fig. 4a) and the other half were
presented in Feng font (an unfamiliar font type that simulates
handwriting; Fig. 4b). They were instructed to read aloud the
characters as quickly and as accurately as possible. The
characters were arranged from high to low frequency
(frequency information for primary students was obtained
from Leung & Lee, 2001). The trials stopped after 5
consecutive errors made. Each trial started with a central
fixation cross for 500ms, followed by the character
presentation. The screen turned blank after a child had
responded and the experimenter pressed a button to record
the accuracy and to start the next trial. Their response time
was measured as the time difference between the stimulus
onset and the onset of the pronunciation, detected by a
microphone.
2. Word naming task:
Children read aloud 30 two-character words arranged from
high to low frequency (frequency information for primary
students was obtained from Leung & Lee, 2001) as quickly
and accurately as possible. Half of the stimuli were presented
in Ming font and the other half were presented in Feng font.
The procedure was the same as that of the character naming
task. The response time was measured as the time difference
between the stimulus onset and the onset of the pronunciation
of the first character.

font (a) and Feng font (b).

components are shaded in red. In (b), a 1,000 ms
central fixation cross precedes each trial,
followed by a cue either below or above the cross
to indication which half (top or bottom) of the
characters participants should attend to in the
following display.
Tests for reading and writing performance:
Four tests were administered: 1. Character naming task, 2.
Word naming task, 3. Character copying task, and 4. Word
dictation task. Tasks 1 and 2 assessed participant’s reading
ability, while Tasks 3 and 4 assessed their copying and word
recalling/writing ability respectively.

Writing tests:
3. Character copying task:
Children copied 30 characters (10 real characters, 10
pseudo-characters, and 10 Korean characters) as quickly and
as accurately as possible. The Chinese characters were
randomly selected from the characters used in task 1. The
pseudo-characters were orthographically legal but non-sense
characters. Each trial started with a central fixation cross for
500 ms, followed by the character presentation. Each time,
after a child had copied a character, the experimenter pressed
a button immediately and the screen turned blank to start the
next trial. Their response time was recorded.
4. Word dictation task:
Children wrote down 30 two-character words (the same
words used in task 2) as quickly and as accurately as possible
when they heard each word said in a female voice presented
by a computer. Two-character words were used instead of
characters to reduce ambiguity due to the many homophonic
characters in the Chinese lexicon. Each trial started with the
words “Get ready” on the screen for 500 ms. After hearing
the word, participants pressed corresponding buttons to

2465

indicate whether they could recall the word or not, before
they started writing. After they finished writing, the
experimenter pressed a button to indicate accuracy and to
reveal the next word. Accuracy rate was recorded.
These experiments were all conducted using E-prime v2.0
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA).
Results
Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to investigate HP
effects (congruency: congruent vs. incongruent trials x grade:
Grade 1 vs. Grade 3 vs. Grade 5). We found a significant
effect of grade (F(2, 213) = 25.090, p < 0.001), a significant
effect of congruency (F(1, 213) = 268.319, p < 0.001), and an
interaction between congruency and grade (F(1, 213) =
11.376, p < 0.001). The main effect of congruency suggests
that across grades, children process Chinese characters
holistically. While the main effect of grade showed that the
performance level increased with grade, the interaction
between grade and congruency suggests that children
processed Chinese characters with varying levels of
congruency effect across grades (Fig. 5).

congruent trials (i.e., Holistic A') between children in the 3
grades. We found that first graders had a larger Holistic A'
than third graders (t(127) = 2.334, p <.05)] and fifth graders
(t(141) = 5.401, p < .001), while third graders had a larger
Holistic A' than fifth graders (t(158) = 2.230, p < .05). These
results suggest that HP of Chinese characters in children was
reduced as they reached higher grades (see Fig. 5).
Chinese proficiency tests
Pearson’s correlation regression analysis showed a positive
correlation between grade and character-naming accuracy (r2
= .602, p < .001), word-naming accuracy (r2 = .512, p < .001)
and dictation accuracy (r2 = .707, p < .001); and a negative
correlation between grade and character-naming response
time (r2 = .269, p < .001), word-naming response time (r2
= .347, p < .001) and character-copying response time (r2
= .620, p < .001). These results suggest that children had
better Chinese reading and writing proficiency as they
reached higher grades.
Font familiarity effect on character and word naming
Repeated-measures ANOVA (font: Ming vs. Feng x grade)
was used for the analysis on character-naming response time.
We found a main effect of font (F(1,181) = 16.9, p < .001)
and a main effect of grade (F(2,181) = 37.01, p << .001), but
no interaction effect was found between font and grade
(F(2,181) = .348, n.s.).
For word-naming response time, we found a main effect of
font (F(1,177) = 17.1, p < .001) and a main effect of grade
(F(2,177) = 59.6, p << .001). We also found an interaction

Pairwise post-hoc t-tests showed that A' in congruent trials
was larger than in incongruent trials in first (t(55) = 12.01, p
< .001), third (t(72) = 7.838, p < .001) and fifth graders (t(86)
= 8.439, p < .001). In congruent trials, first graders had a
smaller A' than third (t(127) = 3.226, p < .01) and fifth
graders (t(141) = 4.576, p < .001) while third and fifth
graders did not differ statistically in A' (t(158) = .994, n.s.).
In incongruent trials, first graders had a smaller A' than third
(t(127) = 3.991, p < .001) and fifth graders (t(141) = 7.878, p
< .001), and third graders had a smaller A' than fifth graders
(t(158) = 2.450, p < .05). We also conducted pairwise
post-hoc t-tests on the A' difference between incongruent and

effect between font and grade (F(2,177) = 3.894, p < .05). We
then performed pairwise post-hoc t-tests on the response time
difference between Ming font words and Feng font words
among children in the 3 grades. We found that first graders
had a larger font effect in response time than third graders
(t(109)=1.941, p = .055) and fifth graders (t(117) = 2.192, p
< .05) while third and fifth graders did not differ statistically
(t(128) = .135, n.s.). These results suggest that word-naming
performances depended greatly on font familiarity in lower
grades than in upper grades. This font-grade interaction was
not found in character-naming.
Hierarchical Regression Analysis
We investigated how HP could be uniquely predicted by
literacy level by partialing out the variance due to age. As
summarized in Table 2, HP was predicted uniquely by
reading and writing performance and vice versa. The
variance of HP can be significantly explained by reading and
dictation performances, but not copying performance, when
partialing out the variance due to age.
Mediation Analysis
We conducted a mediation analysis to test the mediation
effect of HP between dictation accuracy and word naming
accuracy 3 . Regression analysis revealed that Holistic A'
predicted word naming accuracy (β = -.265, p < .01). A Sobel
mediation test showed that Holistic A' significantly mediated
the relationship between dictation accuracy and word naming
accuracy (z = 2.403, p < .05). The mediator effect of Holistic
A' was partial as the direct effect of dictation accuracy and
word naming accuracy remained statistically significant, β
= .635, p < .001 (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Our study showed that children in upper grades processed
Chinese characters less holistically than children in lower
grades. Further analyses showed that this effect could not be
solely accounted for by age. Consistent with Hsiao and
Cottrell’s (2009) findings, better Chinese reading and writing
proficiency strongly predicted reduced HP. Because

elementary schools in Hong Kong do not explicitly teach
children Chinese character radicals (Ho et al., 2003), their
reduction in HP in upper grades is more likely the result of
enhanced Chinese literacy.
Previous studies had reported a close relationship between
Chinese writing and reading performance. Yet, the
underlying mechanism remained unclear (e.g., Guan et al.,
2011; McBride-Chang et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2005; Tse et al.,
2010). In our study, the mediation analysis suggests that HP
is a significant mediator of dictation accuracy and word
naming accuracy (Fig. 6). This result is consistent with our
hypothesis that the HP effect in Chinese character
recognition is predicted by writing performance (i.e., the
ability to recall and write down Chinese characters), and in
turn predicts word reading performance (Fig. 1). Perhaps
writing experience enhances the ability to analyze the
orthographic structures and components of Chinese
characters in children, which leads to reduced HP (i.e., more
analytic) as suggested in Tso and colleagues’ (2011) study.
Consistent with previous findings that suggest our
sensorimotor learning influences our perception (He et al.,
2003; James & Atwood, 2009; Longcamp et al., 2003), we
show how writing performance can be associated with
reduced HP in Chinese character recognition. In addition, we
show that this change in the perception of Chinese characters
(reduced HP) can in turn modulate reading performance. This
study is also the first to report on the developmental
trajectory of HP of Chinese characters in children.
Our results also revealed that children were better at
recognizing Chinese characters and words in a familiar font
(Ming) than in an unfamiliar font (Feng); this effect of font
familiarity was more prominent in first graders than third and
fifth graders. ANCOVA analysis showed that the group
difference in the font familiarity effect became insignificant
when dictation accuracy was set as a covariate (F(2,172) =
1.84, n.s.). This suggests that writing experience, measured
as the ability to recall and write characters here, facilitates
reading words in an unfamiliar font (Tso et al., 2011). Further
investigation, however, is needed to see whether this effect is
due to a particular dimension or general improvement in
literacy.
As future work, we will obtain information of HP of
Chinese characters from non-Chinese speaking children that
do not receive the local Chinese curriculum as a control
group. We speculate that the pattern of their holistic
processing of Chinese characters will not drop as much as
Chinese-learning children as they do not learn to write
Chinese explicitly.
In conclusion, our study provides an information
processing account of the relationship between writing and
reading ability in Chinese children. We show that children
learning to read and write Chinese characters processed
Chinese characters with reduced HP as they reached upper
grades; this reduction in HP may be facilitated by writing
experience and may in turn enhance word reading ability.

This mediation pathway with word-naming accuracy as the first
and dictation accuracy as the final step was not significant.
