Abstract

How Gesture Affects L2 Communication
To date, little research has addressed how gesture affects
communication between L2 learners and their interlocutors
in real-time conversation. Work examining the question of
whether speakers use gesture in a communicative sense in
general has provided evidence that speakers modify their
gesture qualitatively and quantitatively when interlocutors
are visible. In particular, this work has revealed that
speakers produce gestures that are more iconic, elaborate,
and larger when they are speaking to an interlocutor who is
present and visible, as opposed to an interlocutor who is
present but occluded or an interlocutor who is on the phone
(Alibali, Heath, & Myers, 2001; Bavelas, Gerwing, Sutton,
& Prevost, 2008). These results suggest that speakers do
indeed use gesture as a communicative device.
If speakers use gesture to facilitate communication, then it
follows that they should also modify their gestures when
conversing with L2 learners, who often encounter difficulty
comprehending L2 speech. Indeed, related research has
shown that native speakers hyperarticulate vowels when
speaking to adult L2 learners, demonstrating that they are
aware of L2 learners’ comprehension-related needs (Uther,
Knoll, & Burnham, 2007). In one of the few studies to
examine native speakers’ gesture in the presence of L2
learners, native speakers of English produced more deictic
and iconic gestures when retelling a narrative to L2 English
learners than to English-speaking interlocutors (Adams,
1998). This finding suggests that speakers rely on gesture
as a communicative medium to a greater degree with L2
learners than with native interlocutors.
There is also evidence that the gestures that L2 learners
produce when speaking the target language differ
qualitatively from the gestures that they produce when
speaking their native language, as well as from gestures
produced by native speakers of the target language. One
such difference is that gestures accompanying L2 learners’
utterances in the target language tend to be over-explicit.
For example, L2 learners are much more likely to produce
iconic gestures when referring to entities that they have
previously mentioned when speaking the target language

Previous research has provided evidence that second language
(L2) learners use gesture to enhance spoken communication
with interlocutors, and that gesture facilitates L2 word
learning. The current study investigates how L2 learners use
gesture to communicate in conversational settings, and
whether their gesturing in these settings facilitates L2
acquisition beyond the immediate context. The results reveal
that L2 learners produce more iconic gestures when their
interlocutor is visible, and that gesture production predicts
their recall for novel words introduced in conversation. As
such, they indicate that conversational gesturing enhances
acquisition of the target language more broadly, facilitating
L2 communication, acquisition, and retention.

Introduction
Language acquisition, like other aspects of human
communication, is profoundly multimodal. Children
learning how to speak often use their hands and bodies to
express themselves, even before they can speak (Acredolo
& Goodwyn, 1988). Once children begin speaking, they
begin producing gestures concurrently with speech to help
them express themselves (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow,
2005). However, it is less well-known how gesture
facilitates second language (L2) learning by adults.
Although previous research has provided evidence that
isolated gestures can enhance L2 word learning in
instructional settings (Allen, 1995; Kelly, McDevitt, &
Esch, 2009; Tellier, 2008), it is unclear whether L2 learners’
discourse comprehension benefits from conversational
gestures. Furthermore, it is unclear whether L2 learners’
gestures facilitate communication with interlocutors in the
target language, or whether they benefit only the speaker by
providing a method of “thinking out loud.” The present
research addresses these questions by examining how
interlocutor visibility and gestural priming affect gesture use
among L2 learners. Moreover, this research examines
whether enhanced real-time comprehension transfers to
other domains, benefiting L2 learning more broadly.

than their native language (Gullberg, 2003). This tendency
mirrors their use of nouns rather than pronouns to refer to
previously mentioned entities in the target language. Other
work has provided evidence that the syntax and semantics of
L2 learners’ native language influences the gestures that
they produce when speaking the target language. As a result,
L2 learners’ gestures differ in subtle ways from the gestures
of native speakers of the target language, such as in the way
that path and manner are expressed (Stam, 2006; Yoshioka
& Kellerman, 2006). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether
native speakers of the target language notice these
differences in L2 learners’ gesture, and to date, there is no
conclusive evidence that they hinder communication
between L2 learners and native interlocutors.
In fact, despite the nuanced ways in which L2 learners’
gesture may differ from the gesture of native speakers, there
is evidence that gesture facilitates communication between
L2 learners and native interlocutors. To this end, one study
revealed that L2 learners frequently gestured when they
were unable to complete an utterance in Japanese,
prompting Japanese interlocutors to suggest semantically
appropriate completions (Mori & Hayashi, 2006). Along
similar lines, a case study of gesture use between a L2
English learner and his tutor revealed that the learner often
gestured when searching for words, cuing the tutor to
complete the learner’s utterances while simultaneously
producing similar gestures (McCafferty, 2002). Taken
together, these findings reveal that both L2 learners and
native speakers use gesture to convey information that their
interlocutors may not be able to comprehend via speech,
serving as an alternative channel of symbolic
communication. Furthermore, these findings suggest that
both L2 learners and native interlocutors can understand and
use information conveyed via gesture to rectify
incomprehensible or incomplete utterances, thereby
facilitating communication in the target language.

Taken together, these results indicate that iconic gesture
may help beginning L2 learners to associate L2 lexical items
with their meanings, thereby facilitating L2 word learning.
Despite the preponderance of evidence that gesture
facilitates L2 lexical acquisition, research examining the
effect of gesture on other aspects of L2 acquisition has been
rather sparse and has produced inconsistent findings. The
results of several studies have failed to show evidence that
beat (simple rhythmic), deictic (pointing), or iconic gestures
can enhance the perception of novel L2 phonological
contrasts (Hirata & Kelly, 2010; Jesse & Mitterer, 2011;
Kelly & Lee, 2011). To date, no published research has
investigated whether gesture can facilitate the acquisition of
morphosyntax by L2 learners. On a broader level, some
work (Lazaraton, 2004; Sueyoshi & Hardison, 2005) has
provided evidence that gesture facilitates L2 learners’
comprehension of instructional lectures given in the target
language. However, it is unclear from this work what types
of gestures enhance listening comprehension, as well as
which aspects of comprehension they affect.
Although previous research has not directly investigated
the cognitive processes responsible for gesture’s impact on
various aspects of L2 acquisition, it is possible to make
some inferences about them by considering the foci and
design of the studies discussed above. First, gesture’s
facilitation of the acquisition of lexical items but not
phoneme perception suggests that the benefits of gesture in
L2 learning may be localized to individual stimuli, rather
than generalizable to related members of a category. This
interpretation is particularly plausible in light of the fact that
most of the research investigating the effect of gesture on
L2 acquisition has been conducted with novice L2 learners,
who lack an understanding of how various elements of the
target language are related. Second, the observation that
representative iconic gestures—but not non-representative
iconic gestures or other types of gestures—enhance L2
lexical acquisition suggests that isomorphism between
gestures and the visuospatial properties of referents is
necessary for gesture to benefit L2 word learning. Third, the
more pronounced effect of gesture enactment than gesture
viewing on L2 lexical acquisition suggests that the
engagement of embodied action may also play a key role in
explaining gesture’s facilitation of L2 word learning.

How Gesture Affects L2 Acquisition and Retention
Given the evidence that L2 learners can use gesture to
facilitate their production and comprehension of the target
language in conversational settings, it follows that gesture
may facilitate not only communication, but also acquisition
and retention of the target language. Indeed, research has
provided evidence that gesture can enhance the acquisition
and recall of L2 lexical items. One study showed that firstsemester L2 students learned French figurative expressions
accompanied by representational gestures more effectively
than expressions that were presented without gesture (Allen,
1995). Similarly, individuals unfamiliar with Japanese
recalled the meanings of Japanese verbs over the course of a
week more accurately when they were presented with
representative iconic gestures than when they were
presented as speech only, without gesture (Kelly et al.,
2009). Finally, during instruction spanning 4 weeks,
children learning English recalled more words from this
language when they enacted representative iconic gestures
than when they learned the word meanings via images.

Methods
Participants
Sixty undergraduates were recruited in pairs from the
participant pool at UCSC. All recruited individuals were
fluent English speakers1 and confirmed that they had no
knowledge of Hungarian prior to the experiment.
Additionally, all recruited individuals had normal hearing
and normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

Participants were not required to be native English speakers,
given that the English glosses of the signs were common words
that should be comprehensible to non-native undergraduates, who
must be sufficiently proficient to understand academic English.

recorded while learning the words. A video camera hidden
behind a one-way mirror oriented perpendicular to the table
was focused on participants during the learning phase of the
experiment, providing a 180° view of them (see Figure 1).
The screen of the computer on which stimuli were presented
was oriented at a 180° angle from the camera, in order to
ensure that the experimenters were blind to the presentation
modality of the words. Participants’ interactions were never
heard or seen by anyone other than the experimenters.
During trials of the learning phase, a Hungarian word was
presented to the teacher for 2500 ms., and after a 1000 ms.
interval, its gloss was presented for 2500 ms. Words in both
languages were presented to the teacher as speech over
headphones connected to the computer. Words were
presented visually via either video of a Hungarian-English
bilingual saying them while concurrently producing an
iconic gesture representing their meaning, or via text
displayed on screen; word presentation modality was varied
within participants. Following a 2000 ms. interval, the
words were repeated once in this sequence, and then a
screen instructing the teacher to teach the word to the
learner was displayed until the teacher pressed a button to
indicate readiness to proceed to the next trial. After all 20
words had been presented, participants were told to summon
the experimenter so that the learner could be tested.
In the test phase, the teacher was informed that he or she
would also be tested to gauge how well he or she had
learned the words. Both participants were placed in separate
rooms for this part of the experiment. During test trials, each
Hungarian word that participants had learned was presented
as text and speech. Participants responded by saying the
corresponding English word or by saying “skip” if they
could not remember it. After having completed the test
phase, participants were debriefed and informed of the
actual purpose of the experiment, and were given the
opportunity to have their recordings destroyed. All declined.

Stimuli
Twenty Hungarian words were selected for use in this study
(see Table 1). Prior to this research, 15 English speakers
who did not participate in this study were asked to rate the
concreteness, imageability, and meaningfulness of the
English glosses of 80 candidate words, and to gesture in a
way that represented the meaning of each gloss. The 20
words with the most consistent responses from each of the
three categories listed above were selected for inclusion in
the study. Videos of iconic gestures were created by
recording a fluent Hungarian-English bilingual saying these
words in each language while enacting the gestures
produced by the most participants. In order to control for
possible vocal iconicity, audio of the pronunciation of
Hungarian and English words was extracted from the iconic
gesture videos and was played during presentation of text
words in the non-gesture presentation condition.

Procedure
In the learning phase of the experiment, participants were
randomly assigned via coin flip to be either the teacher or
the learner, and to be in either the visible or occluded
condition. Participants were seated on either side of a table
that was either unobstructed or was divided by a large,
opaque cardboard screen. The teacher was seated in front of
an iMac G4 with a 20 in. screen, on which the stimuli were
presented. Prior to beginning the experiment, participants
were told that the focus of the study was to examine
teaching and learning strategies for L2 vocabulary. To this
end, the teacher was told that he or she would learn the
meanings of twenty Hungarian words one-by-one. The
teacher was instructed to teach each word to their partner
“however [they] think the learner will learn them best,” with
the only restriction being that both the teacher and learner
must remain seated at the table during the entire learning
phase. The learner was told that he or she would be tested
after the learning phase to determine how well he or she had
learned the words. After ensuring that the participants
understood the instructions, the experimenter left the room.
Although participants were informed that their speech
would be audio recorded during the learning phase for later
analysis, they were not told that they would also be video

Coding
Participants’ speech was transcribed verbatim, and all
gestures were identified. Gestures were classified as one of
three types: iconic (handshape and/or motion resembles
referent attributes), beat (non-iconic emphasizing), or
deictic (pointing). Individual gestures were distinguished
from one another by a change in hand shape or motion. For

example, an extension of the hand forward with the palm up
produced concurrently with the word “to deliver” was coded
as one iconic gesture. If a similar movement occurred as the
first motion of a sequence in which the fingers of the hand
closed and the hand moved in a lateral turning motion (for
key), this entire sequence was coded as one iconic gesture.

Results
Learning task
In order to investigate the relationship between speech and
concurrent gestures produced during the learning task, we
first examined the quantity and content of participants’
speech. A univariate ANOVA conducted on total amount of
speech produced in the learning task revealed main effects
of participant role, F(1, 59) = 6.22, p = .02, ηp2 = .14, and
visibility, F(1, 59) = 4.23, p = .05, ηp2 = .10. However, the
interaction between these factors failed to reach
significance. Bonferroni-corrected post hoc tests showed
that teachers spoke significantly more than learners, (p =
.02), and that occluded interlocutors spoke more than visible
interlocutors (p = .05; see Table 2). Nevertheless, all
participants repeated the target words with comparable
frequency across the visible and occluded conditions,
suggesting that differences in speech were caused by verbal
elaboration rather than repetition of target words.
Prior to analysis, the distribution of gesture data was
examined to determine whether it was normal. Shapiro-Wilk
tests revealed that none of the distributions of any of the
gesture types for either participant were normal. As can be
seen from Table 3, this was primarily due to the skewness
and kurtosis of the data. Because analysis of variance is
robust against violations of normality (Hays, 1973), it was
used as the primary method of analysis. However, nonparametric tests were also conducted to ensure the validity
of the results obtained using parametric statistics.
Before conducting the main analyses, it was necessary to
determine whether the number of gestures produced by

teachers and learners differed reliably for pairs assigned to
the visible and occluded conditions. Independent-samples t
tests revealed that the difference between the number of
iconic gestures produced by teachers and learners whose
interlocutor was visible was marginally significant, t(29) =
1.92, p = .07, d = .86 (this was confirmed by a MannWhitney U test, U(29) = 22.50, p = .04). No other
significant differences were found between teachers’ and
learners’ production of iconic, beat, or deictic gestures.
Based on the results of these preliminary analyses, teachers’
and learners’ iconic gestures were analyzed separately, but
beat and deictic gestures were collapsed across participants.
To determine whether interlocutor visibility and word
presentation mode affected iconic gesture production, iconic
gesture data was submitted to two repeated measures
ANOVAs (one for the teacher and one for the learner). The
analysis of teachers’ iconic gesture showed a main effect of
word presentation mode, F(1, 29) = 21.33, p < .001, ηp2 =
.50, and interlocutor visibility, F(1, 29) = 6.95, p = .02, ηp2 =
.25; however, the interaction between these two factors
failed to reach significance (see Figure 2). The effect of
word presentation mode on teachers’ iconic gesture was
confirmed by a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Z(29) = 3.61, p
< .001, and the effect of visibility was confirmed by a
Mann-Whitney U test, U(29) = 23.50, p = .02. Bonferronicorrected post hoc tests revealed that teachers produced a
significantly greater number of iconic gestures when
conveying the meanings of words that they had learned via
iconic gesture than words that they had learned via text (p
<.001), and that they produced more iconic gestures when
communicating with visible interlocutors than occluded
interlocutors (p = .02). The analysis of learners’ iconic
gesture failed to show a main effect of either presentation
mode or interlocutor visibility; similarly, the results of a
Wilcoxon signed-rank test and a Mann-Whitney U test
failed to reach significance. However, in this case, the
interaction between word presentation mode and
interlocutor visibility reached significance, F(1, 29) = 4.71,
p < .04, ηp2 = .18; see Figure 2. Taken together, these results
provide evidence that the acquisition of novel word
meanings via iconic gestures and the presence of a visible
interlocutor cause L2 learners to increase their production of
iconic gestures, thereby facilitating communication.
To determine whether interlocutor visibility and word
presentation mode affected participants’ production of beat
and deictic gestures, data for each of these gesture types was
examined using a repeated measures ANOVA.

However, additional analogous analyses failed to show
that repetitions of target words by teachers and learners
during the learning phase predicted their own word recall
at test, or that teachers’ target word repetitions during
learning predicted learners’ recall at test (see Table 4).
In order to examine whether the viewing of iconic
gestures during the learning phase affected L2 word recall
for the teacher, word recall data was submitted to a
paired-samples t test using word presentation modality as
a within-participants factor. This analysis showed that
teachers recalled words with comparable accuracy
regardless of whether the words had been presented with
iconic gestures or text in the learning phase, t(29) = 1.08,
p = .29, d = .20. In order to examine whether gesture
viewing during the learning phase affected word recall for
the learner, learners’ word recall scores were regressed on
number of iconic gestures produced by teachers during
the learning phase. This analysis showed that teachers’
iconic gestures failed to predict learners’ word recall
accuracy, b = -.28, t(29) = 1.04, p = .31. Together, these
results indicate that simply viewing iconic gestures during
L2 word learning is insufficient to promote word recall.
Finally, in order to determine whether gesture
enactment affected L2 word learning, teachers’ and
learners’ word recall scores were regressed on the number
of gestures (iconic, beat, and deictic) that they produced
during the learning phase. This analysis revealed that
teachers’ beat and deictic gestures positively predicted
their recall of L2 words, but that their iconic gestures
negatively predicted L2 word recall. Moreover, this
analysis failed to reveal that learners’ gestures predicted
their word recall at test (see Table 4).

Figure 2: Boxplots showing number of iconic gestures
produced by teachers and learners, by word presentation
mode and interlocutor visibility.
This analysis revealed no significant effects of either
interlocutor visibility or presentation mode, indicating
that participants produced beat and deictic gestures with
similar frequency, regardless of these factors.

L2 Word Recall

Discussion

L2 word recall was quantified using a binary coding
scheme for each word (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect/skipped),
which was summed across words to yield a total number
of words recalled out of twenty for each participant. Prior
to investigating the gesture data, we first examined
whether total amount of speech and target word
repetitions predicted word recall accuracy.
Three separate linear regression analyses revealed that
the amount of speech produced by teachers and learners
significantly predicted their word recall, and that the
amount of teachers’ speech also predicted learners’ recall.

The current study examined the impact of gesture
production on communication and acquisition of a novel
second language. The results showed that participants
produced more iconic gestures when the meanings of L2
words are conveyed to them via gesture, and when they
are communicating with a visible interlocutor. This
indicates that viewing iconic gestures primes the
production of iconic gestures. More importantly,
however, it demonstrates that interlocutors use iconic
gesture to facilitate communication in a novel second
language, corroborating the findings of other studies of

Table 4: Word recall, as predicted by teachers’ and learners’ speech and iconic, beat, and deictic gesture production.

L2 learners’ conversational interactions (Adams, 1998;
McCafferty, 2002; Mori & Hayashi, 2006). Furthermore,
the results of the current study revealed that participants
produced more gestures when their interlocutor was visible,
but more speech when their interlocutor was occluded. This
dissociation indicates that interlocutors are aware of the
communicative properties of each modality, and use them
appropriately when conveying L2 words.
More interestingly, however, the results of the current
study provide evidence that participants’ use of beat and
deictic gesture during conversational interactions enhanced
their L2 acquisition beyond the immediate communicative
context, whereas their use of iconic gestures did not produce
this effect. Considered as a whole, these results suggest that
gesture effectively supplements information conveyed via
speech, but cannot replace it. Moreover, the lack of
facilitation of gesture viewing for both teachers and learners
is inconsistent with work showing that mere exposure to
gesture facilitates L2 word learning (Allen, 1995; Kelly et
al., 2009), but is consistent with work showing that gesture
enactment enhances L2 word learning more effectively than
gesture viewing (Tellier, 2008). Future research should
investigate the circumstances under which gesture
enactment and viewing differentially benefit L2 acquisition,
further clarifying its role in the communication, acquisition,
and retention of a novel second language.
