Abstract
Many languages have a word class whose speech sounds are
linked to sensory experiences (sound symbolism). Here we
investigated sound symbolism in touch. Specifically, we
performed psychophysical experiments to study the
relationship between phonemes of Japanese sound symbolic
words and emotional evaluations of objects in contact.
Participants expressed the sensation obtained from touched
materials using Japanese sound symbolic words and evaluated
the comfort of tactile sensation. Our results show the
existence of unique associations between the phonemes of the
words for expressing the sensation and the evaluations of
comfort in touch. Next, we compared the results with those
for a condition in which the evaluations of comfort on tactile
materials were made without expressing the sensations. We
found that when certain phonemes are used for expressing the
sensation, the evaluations can be biased.
Keywords: Sound symbolism; Tactile sensation; Emotional
judgment; Onomatopoeia

Introduction
Against a classical notion in linguistics that speech sounds
and meanings of words are independent, the existence of
synesthetic associations between sounds and sensory
experiences (sound symbolism) has been demonstrated over
the decades (e.g., Fox, 1935; Jespersen, 1922; Köhler, 1929,
1947; Newman, 1933; Sapir, 1929; Taylor, 1963; Werner &
Wapner, 1952; Wertheimer, 1958, for early studies) and,
more or less, in the languages of the world (e.g., Brown,
Black, & Horowitz, 1955; Davis, 1961; Emeneau, 1969;
Enfield, 2005; Hinton, Nichols, & Ohala, 1994; Klank,
Huang, & Johnson, 1971; Kovic, Plunkett, & Westermann,
2010; Nuckrolls, 1999; Voeltz & Kilian-Hatz, 2001). The
characteristics and universality of such sensory-sound
correspondence have been studied to provide a clue for
understanding the development of language abilities (Imai,
Kita, Nagumo, & Okada, 2008; Kantartzis, Imai, & Kita,

2011; Maurer, Pathman, & Mondloch, 2006; Westbury,
2004) and language evolution (Ohala, 1997; Ramachandran
& Hubbard, 2001, 2003).
It is also known that the sensory-sound correspondence can
be found not only in words referring to visual shapes, which
were demonstrated in the landmark studies (e.g., mal/mil
and buba/kiki for round and sharp shapes in Sapir, 1929 and
Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001, respectively), but also in
those referring to tactile, smell, and taste sensations.
However, the majority of studies in the area of sound
symbolism have been limited to visual-sound
correspondence. Consequently, we are investigating the
sound symbolic associations in touch, specifically the
association between the phonemes of Japanese sound
symbolic words (onomatopoeia) for expressing tactile
sensations and subjective evaluations of comfort/discomfort
for touched objects.
We focus on tactile-emotional evaluations, because
compared with other languages, Japanese is known to have
a large number of onomatopoeic words for tactile sensations,
and because associations between the phonemes of Japanese
onomatopoeic words and typical categories of tactile
sensations (not emotion) can be observed. For example,
onomatopoeic words expressing a sense of smoothness
often use the consonant /s/ in the first syllable as in "sarasara" [(a) in Table 1], while those expressing roughness
often use /z/ in the first syllable as in "zara-zara" [(b) in
Table 1]. Similarly, characteristic first consonants are
observed in each of the tactile categories, such as /p/ for
softness as in "puru-puru" [(c) in Table 1] and /k/ for
hardness as in "kachi-kachi" [(d) in Table 1]. More
importantly, tactile sensations are strongly connected to
changes in the states of comfort and discomfort (Gallace, &
Spence, 2010), and although it has been reported that
touching objects can evoke distinct emotional states
according to the textures of touched objects (Ramachandran,

2517

& Brang, 2008), the associations between speech sound for
expressing tactile sensations and touch-induced emotional
states are unclear.

In the current study, we performed two psychophysical
experiments. In the first experiment, when participants
touched an object, they were asked to express the tactile
sensation using Japanese onomatopoeic words [sound
symbolic words (SSWs)] and then rate the comfort of the
touched object with the semantic differential (SD) method
(referred as the SSW+SD condition). This condition was
aimed at specifying the systematic association between
phonemes of Japanese onomatopoeic words and tactileemotional evaluations. Our results demonstrate for the first
time the existence of unique associations between them.
Next, we compared the results for the SSW+SD condition
with those for a condition in which participants made only
the tactile-emotional evaluations (SD-only condition). Since
recent brain-imaging studies suggests that processing of
SSWs could activate corresponding sensory areas (Arata,
Imai, Okuda, Okada, & Matsuda, 2010; Hashimoto, Usui,
Taira, Nose, Haji, & Kojima, 2006; Osaka, Osaka,
Morishita, Kondo, & Fukuyama, 2004), it is expected that
speaking them might affect speaker’s subjective evaluation
of the touched objects. The results demonstrate that when
certain phonemes are used for expressing the sensation, the
evaluation can be biased.

Materials and Methods
Participants
Thirty naïve participants, aged between 19 and 26 years
old, took part in the experiments. Fifteen of the 30 (ten
males and five females) performed the experiment in the
SSW+SD condition; the other fifteen (ten males and five
females) performed the experiment in the SD-only condition.
They were unaware of the purpose of the experiments, and
they had no known abnormalities of their verbal or tactile
sensory systems or any particular skills with respect to
touch. They visited a laboratory at the University of ElectroCommunications for one day to conduct trials. Informed
consent was obtained from the participants before the
experiment started. Recruitment of the participants and
experimental procedures were approved by the University of
Electro-Communication Research Ethics Committee and
were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.

Apparatus and Materials
We selected 120 types of tactile materials for the
experiments, including fabrics, papers, metals, leathers,
rubbers, woods, sand, rocks, and plastics. Preliminarily, we
confirmed that onomatopoeic words for expressing the 120
materials would cover the major phonemes of Japanese
onomatopoeic words in touch. When feasible, samples were
cut to a size of 6 cm x 6 cm and stacked in layers to 2-mm
thickness. The rocks and sand were loose in a container. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, participants sat in front of a box with an
8 cm x 10 cm hole in it (the materials box) and placed the
index finger of the dominant hand into the box through the
hole to touch a material; they could not see a material while
they were touching it.

Figure 1: Participant touching a material.

Procedure
A trial in the SSW+SD condition comprised a describing
period, in which participants reported an onomatopoeic
word to express the tactile feeling while touching one of the
120 materials, and a rating period, in which they evaluated
the comfort/discomfort of the touched material on a sevenpoint scale (Very comfortable +3, Comfortable +2, Slightly
comfortable +1, Neither 0, and three levels, -1 to -3, for
uncomfortable feeling) while touching it. In the describing
and rating periods, they could freely run their fingers and
push on the surface of the material, and the time for
answering was not limited. A trial in the SD-only condition
comprised only the rating period. In the experiments, the
experimenter placed one material in the material box, and
the participant touch it and respond, and then replaced it
with another after the participant’s response. Tactile
materials were presented in a random order.

Results for SSW+SD condition
The results for the SSW+SD condition produced 1800 sets
of onomatopoeic words and subjective evaluations of
comfort level (120 materials x 15 participants). In 87.1% of
all trials (1569 cases), the onomatopoeic word had a twomora repetition form (e.g. "sara-sara"). We therefore
analyzed the relationship between the phonemes of
onomatopoeic words in two-mora repetitions form and
evaluations of comfort/discomfort using the 1569 instances.
The average of the ratings obtained across the 1569 cases
was 0.08. This value suggests that half of trials yielded a
rating in a comfortable level, and the other half a rating in
an uncomfortable level (nonbiased for participant’s response
opportunities).

(e.g, an analysis based on the value of /sa/ rather than the
values of /s/ and /a/ separately). Table 3 shows the results of
combinations between the vowels and consonants, which
are listed in Table 2. The vowel /u/ was significantly related
to comfort with many consonants (e.g., /h/ as in "huwahuwa", /s/ as in "sube-sube", /t/ as in "tsuru-tsuru", and /p/
as in "puru-puru"). Conversely, /e/ was related to discomfort
with any consonant (e.g., /p/ as in "pecha-pecha", /n/ as in
"neba-neba", and /b/ as in "beta-beta"). Consonants /m/, /h/,
and /s/ were related to comfort regardless of the vowel,
while /g/, /z/, /j/, /b/, and /n/ were related to discomfort
regardless of the vowel. Vowels /o/, /a/ and /i/ and
consonants /p/ and /t/ were related to different levels of
comfort depending on the consonant or vowel they were
combined with, suggesting that as phonemes, they have only
a weak relation to comfort level.

We took particular note of the vowels and consonants of
the first syllable, which show strong sound symbolic
associations (Hamano, 1998). The averages of ratings across
trials in which the same phonemes were used in the first
syllable were statistically compared with the average of the
1569 cases (0.08) (t-test comparing the average with
constant value). Of the vowels, as shown in Table 2, only /u/
had a statistically significant relationship to comfort. Vowels
/i/ and /e/ were not used often, but they were deeply related
to discomfort (/i/ was marginally significant, and /e/ was
significant). Among the consonants, /m/, /h/, and /s/ were
related to comfort, while /g/, /z/, /j/, /b/, and /n/ were
significantly related to discomfort.
Next, we combined the vowels and consonants of the first
syllables and did a similar statistical analysis for the values

whose numbers were more than 16 (1 % of 1569 cases) are listed. P-values of statistical analysis to the overall

Results for SD-only condition
We compared the results for the SSW+SD condition with
those for the SD-only condition to examine the influence of
expressing the sensations with sound symbolic words on the
emotional evaluation (comfort level). First, we calculated
averages of ratings for each tactile material (120 materials)
in the SSW+SD (using 1569 cases) and SD-only (using
1800 cases) conditions. The analyses using 240 averaged
values (120 materials x 2 conditions) were performed in two
domains, in which the averaged values in the SD-only
condition were positive (comfort materials) or negative
(discomfort materials). For comfort materials (62 materials),
the means of ratings across 62 materials were 0.70 in
SSW+SD and 0.73 in SD-only. They were not significantly
different (paired t-test, t(61) = 0.39, p = 0.70). On the other
hand, for discomfort materials (58 materials), the means
across 58 materials were -0.48 in SSW+SD and -0.73 in the
SD-only. There were significant differences between the
values (t(57) = 3.41, p < .001). These statistical analyses
indicate that expressing tactile sensations with sound
symbolic words while touching materials does not affect the
emotional evaluation if the material is originally
comfortable. However, when a touched material elicits
discomfort, the emotional evaluation can be attenuated by
expressing the sensation with sound symbolic words.
To clarify the systematic association between phonemes of
onomatopoeic words and their influence on the evaluation,
we made distribution maps of 120 materials as shown in
Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The phonemes represent each
material in the maps. The representing phonemes were
determined from the first syllables used for expressing the
sensations most in the trials in the SSW+SD condition. Ones
in the right-side area in the maps are comfortable materials
and vice versa. In addition, ones in the upper side in the
maps indicate materials whose comfort levels are improved
(Left side: attenuated discomfort. Right side: enhanced
comfort) and vice versa. Numbers of phonemes in the upper
and lower right side areas are almost identical in the maps.
On the other hand, more phonemes are located in the upper
left area (attenuated discomfort) than in the lower left area
(enhanced discomfort). This means that the comfort levels
were systematically biased toward comfort for the
discomfort materials, which agrees with the previous
statistical analyses.
The differences in the effect of attenuation or enhancement
according to the phonemes were statistically examined. We
collected phonemes whose numbers in the comfort or
discomfort area were more than six (5% of 120 materials)
and calculated the means of differences of rating values in
the SSW+SD condition from those in the SD-only condition
across their corresponding materials. Figure 4 shows the
trends for the comfort materials. For vowels, /u/ slightly
enhances the comfort (marginally significant effect), but /a/
attenuates the comfort. For consonants, none of the
phonemes affected comfort levels for the comfort materials.
Figure 5 shows the trends for the discomfort materials.

When the phonemes, /u/ in vowels, /z/ and /p/ in consonants,
were used for expressing the tactile sensation, the level of
discomfort can be attenuated. Some negative values in
comfort level (discomfort materials) became positive
(perceived as comfort).

Discussion
Sensory Category and Sound Symbolism
Humans categorize sensory inputs using words, and words
are important indexes in investigating such sensory
categories. Previous touch studies identified major factors in
object recognition through touch and established standards
of classification based on physical properties of materials or
in terms of sets of adjectives (Hollins, Bensmaïa, Karlof, &
Young 2000; Hollins, Faldowski, Rao, & Young, 1993;
Picard, Dacremont, Valentin, & Giboreau, 2003; Tiest, &
Kappers, 2006). However, the studies did not discuss
sensibilities, such as like and dislike or comfort and
discomfort, and to our knowledge, there has been no
research regarding the association between touch-induced
emotional states and sound symbolic words.
In the experiment in the SWS+SD condition, we found a
strong association between comfort and the vowel /u/ and
consonants /m/, /h/, and /s/ in the first syllables. If similar
sensory categories are expressed using onomatopoeic words
with similar phonemes, it will be possible to clarify the
categories of comfort/discomfort, which is difficult to study
directly. Since the tactile sensations described with the
phonemes /m/, /h/, and /s/ seem different, as with "mokomoko" and "huka-huka" for squashiness and "sara-sara" for
smoothness, these phonemes might be originated from
different categories of comfort. Similarly, for discomfort,
the vowel /i/ as in "chiku-chiku" for pointiness and /e/ and
consonants /n/ and /b/ as in "neba-neba" and "beta-beta" for
stickiness, and consonants /j/, /z/, and /g/ as in "jori-jori,"
"zara-zara," and "gori-gori" for roughness may represent
different uncomfortable categories.

Uniqueness of Tactile Sound Symbolism
Phonemes related to tactile comfort or discomfort, together
with the meanings of general sound symbolism in Japanese
onomatopoeic words, are summarized in Table 4 (see
Hamano, 1998). The association between the vowel /u/ and
comfort has not been identified in the general sound
symbolism. For vowel /i/, tactile sensations can be seen as
analogous to general sound symbolism, but the association
with discomfort seems to be particular to tactile sensation.
The association of /e/ with discomfort can be seen as

analogous to general sound symbolism. For consonants, no
association between comfort and consonants /m/, /h/ and /s/
has been suggested. For discomfort, the tactile perception
and comfort level agree with general sound symbolism for
/n/. But it is difficult to analogize the comfort level for /b/
from general sound symbolism, and the association of /z/,
/j/, and /g/ with discomfort also appears to be specific to the
tactile sense.
As for consistency between modalities, there seems to be
similar trends in the sound symbolic relationships between
phonemes and perceptual experiences regarding touch and
tastes. According to Sakamoto and Chiba (2005), vowel /u/
and consonants /s/ and /h/ are associated with positive
evaluations of tastes, while vowels /i/ and /e/ and
consonants /n/, /z/, /j/, /g/, and /b/ are associated with
negative evaluations. In addition, as for the generality of our
results, although the sound symbolism is observed in the
languages of the world, whether the trends obtained in our
experiments are universal or not is an issue awaiting further
investigation.

Affection of Sound Symbolic Words on Evaluation
We found that when certain phonemes are used for
expressing sensations for the touched material, the
evaluations of comfort levels can be biased. Specifically,
when /u/ was used, the bias was always toward comfort,
which agrees with the association between phonemes and
emotional evaluations in Table 2. But neutral phonemes /a/
and /p/ affect the evaluation. In addition, consonant /z/,
which is associated with discomfort, attenuated the
discomfort. Considering that emotional states can be evoked
by the sensations automatically (Ramachandran, & Brang,
2008) and how words are articulated can be a possible
mechanism relevant to sound symbolism (Ohala, 1983), the
sound symbolism of comfort and discomfort for the tactile
sense may be affected by phonetic (acoustic) comfort or
discomfort, as observed in our experiment. But explaining
the association is a problem for future research.
