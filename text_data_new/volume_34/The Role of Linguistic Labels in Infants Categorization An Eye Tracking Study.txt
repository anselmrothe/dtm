Abstract

denote categories and “infants embark on the task of word
learning equipped with a broad, universally shared
expectation, linking words to commonalities among
objects” (Waxman, 2003). According to this view, linguistic
labels refer to category information and facilitate infants’
category learning. There is much evidence consistent with
this view. First, some researchers have demonstrated that
labels may facilitate infants’ categorization above and
beyond other kinds of auditory input (Balaban & Waxman,
1997; Fulkerson & Haaf, 2003; Fulkerson et al., 2006;
Ferry, Hespos, & Waxman, 2010). Second, facilitative
effects of linguistic labels were demonstrated for basic-level
as well as superordinate or global categories (Balaban &
Waxman, 1997; Waxman & Markow, 1995; Waxman &
Booth, 2003). Finally, effects of labels have been shown to
affect infants’ performance on a variety of cognitive tasks,
such as inductive inference (Graham, Kilbreath, Welder,
2004; Welder & Graham, 2001) and object individuation
(Xu, 2002; Xu, Cote, & Baker, 2005).
There are challenges, however, to the idea that linguistic
labels are category markers that facilitate categorization
early in development. There are theoretical proposals
arguing that, at least early in development, labels are
features of items (similar to color or shape) rather than
category markers (Sloutsky & Lo, 1999; Sloutsky & Fisher,
2004; Sloutsky, Lo, & Fisher, 2001) and the contribution of
linguistic labels is driven by attentional rather than
conceptual factors (Napolitano & Sloutsky, 2004; Sloutsky
& Napolitano 2003). There is also evidence that auditory
input overshadows (or attenuates processing of)
corresponding visual input (Lewkowicz, 1988a, 1988b;
Napolitano & Sloutsky, 2004; Robinson et al., 2005;
Robinson & Sloutsky, 2004a, 2004b; Sloutsky &
Napolitano, 2003). Furthermore, many of the studies
examining the effects of labels on infants’ category learning
compared the effects of labels with those of unfamiliar
sounds, but not with a silent condition. When a salient
baseline was introduced (e.g., Robinson & Sloutsky, 2007),
labels did not facilitate infants’ category learning above the

How do words affect categorization? According to one
theoretical account, even early in development, labels are
category markers and are different from other features.
According to another theory, early in development, labels are
part of the input and are no more than other features. The
current study addressed this issue by examining the effects of
labels on category learning in 8- to 12- month infants. Infants
were familiarized with exemplars from one category in either
label-defined or motion-defined condition and then tested
with prototypes from learned category and novel category.
Eye tracking results indicated that infants exhibited better
category learning in the motion-defined than in the labeldefined condition. These results provide little evidence for the
idea that labels are category markers that facilitate category
learning.

Introduction
The ability to form categories is an important component of
human cognition (see Murphy, 2002, for a review). It has
been well established that this ability appears early in
development, with young infants capable of forming
categories at an early age (Eimas & Quinn, 1994; Oakes,
Madole, & Cohen, 1991), and a substantial body of
experimental evidence suggest that linguistic labels affect
this process (Balaban & Waxman, 1997; Waxman &
Markow, 1995; Fulkerson, Waxman, & Seymour, 2006;
Waxman & Booth 2003; Robinson & Sloutsky, 2007).
However, the mechanisms underlying the role of labels
remain unclear, which has generated considerable debate.
Some have argued that words denoting categories have the
special status of category markers and, as such, they
facilitate category learning at the earliest stages of word
learning. At the same time, others have argued that early in
development words are akin to other features, but they may
become category markers in the course of development.
According to the former theory, early in development,
young infants have general assumptions that words but not
other kinds of auditory inputs are category markers which

silent baseline (see also Robinson & Sloutsky, 2008, for
similar findings on individuation tasks).
There is also recent evidence by Deng and Sloutsky
(2012) who demonstrated that labels function the same way
as other features for young children, but they may become
category markers in the course of development. In
particular, Deng and Sloutsky used a variant of Yamauchi &
Markman’s (1998, 2000) paradigm and pitted category label
against a highly salient visual feature. They found that
unlike many adults who relied on category label, children
relied on the salient feature.
If labels are not category markers for preschoolers, how
they can be category markers attracting attention to withincategory commonalities for infants (e.g., Balaban &
Waxman, 1997; Ferry, Hespos, & Waxman, 2010; Waxman
& Markow, 1995)? Although there is evidence that labels
do little above and beyond a silent condition (Robinson &
Sloutsky, 2007), none of the studies claiming that labels are
category markers compared effects of labels with those of
highly salient visual features. How do labels affect (a)
patterns of attention and (b) the outcome of category
learning? And how do these effects differ from those of
highly salient visual features? The goal of this research is to
answer these questions by using a combination of eye
tracking and a more traditional novelty preference
paradigm.

Overview of Current Study
The goal of the study reported here was to examine the role
of labels in category learning in infancy. The experiment
consisted of two between-subjects conditions: label-defined
condition and motion-defined condition. In both conditions,
infants were familiarized with the exemplars from one
category and then tested with the prototype of this category
and that of the contrast category. Infants saw the same
testing stimuli in both conditions and neither label nor
motion was provided during testing. Eye gaze data were
collected from infants while being trained and tested in both
conditions. If labels are category markers and are able to
direct attention to the category-relevant information, then
infants should learn better when labels are provided. This
should not be the case, however, if labels are part of input
rather than category markers.

to collect eye gaze data. The eye-tracker is integrated into a
17-inch computer monitor and located on a table inside a
booth enclosed by black curtains. A trained experimenter
monitored the experiment using Tobii Studio gaze analysis
software installed on a 19-inch Dell OptiPlex 755 computer
outside the booth. A video stream displaying participants’
activities was projected onto a 9-inch black and white Sony
SSM-930 CE television for experimenter’s online
monitoring. Two Dell speakers were located behind a black
curtain on each side of the eye-tracker.

Method
Participants
Thirty-eight infants (16 boys and 22 girls) ranging in age
from 8 to 12 months (M = 10 months, 14 days; SD = 1
month, 27 days) participated in this experiment. Data
provided by 2 infants were excluded from analyses due to
fussiness and 6 infants were excluded for not looking at a
single test trial.

Materials and Design
The materials were colorful drawings of artificial creatures
and novel labels "flurp" and "jalet". The items had five
features varying in color and shape and two categories were
formed by different feature values (see Figure 1). As shown
in Table 1, the two categories have a family-resemblance
structure, which was derived from two prototypes (A0 and
B0) by modifying the values of one of five features – head,
antenna, hands, body, or feet. For example, to produce the

stimulus A1, the value of the antenna was changed from 1 to
0 so that it had four features consistent with the prototype
A0 and one feature consistent with the prototype B0. See
Figure 2 for example of stimuli.
There were two between-subjects conditions (labeldefined vs. motion-defined). In the label-defined condition,
the value of label did not vary across the exemplars;
whereas in the motion-defined condition, a pattern of
motion did not vary across the exemplars. In particular, one
of the features (the feet) was animated to be highly salient
using Macromedia Flash MX software and all the members
of a given category had feet with the same pattern of
motion. For “flurps”, the feet were purple, heart-shaped,
and stretched up and down; whereas, for “jalets”, the feet
were dark blue, arrows-shape, and moved sideways.

label-defined condition. After familiarization, infants were
tested with preference trial (in each block). Each test trial
consisted of the prototype of the category that infants were
trained with in familiarization and the prototype of the
contrast category, and presented without either label or
motion for 8000 msec. A dynamic bouncing ball was
presented as an attention-engager between trials within each
block. A short cartoon video was presented between blocks
in order to let infants have a rest. All gaze data were
recorded by the computer using Tobii Studio gaze analysis
software.

Results
Analyses presented below primarily focused on the
percentage looking to the prototype of novel category at test
and on the patterns of attention during familiarization phase
and testing phase. Gaze data were exported from the
computer using Tobii Studio gaze analysis software. Scenes
were created for every trial (both familiarization and test)
and eighteen areas of interest (AOIs) for fixations were
defined: one rectangle surrounding the creatures on
familiarization trials, two rectangles surrounding two
prototypes respectively on test trials, and fifteen ellipses
surrounding each feature of the creatures on both
familiarization and test trials. These data were used to
calculate (1) novelty preference score based on the
proportion of looking time to the prototype of novel
category as compared to the total looking time to both of the
prototypes at test; and (2) patterns of attention based on the
proportion of looking time to different features on both
familiarization and test trials.

Procedure
Infants were seated on parents’ laps approximately 60 cm
away from the eye-tracker. Parents were instructed not to
interact with infants and not to point or label any of the
stimuli. Prior to the experiment, infants completed a 5-point
calibration sequence. The calibration points consisted of
dynamic kitten images appearing in different locations on
the screen, with “bounce” sound. After successful
calibration, a colorful picture of a baby playing with several
different toys was presented on the screen to keep infants’
attention.
When infants and parents were ready to begin, an
experimenter started the experiment by pressing the space
bar. The picture of baby disappeared and infants were
presented 20 familiarization trials and 4 test trials. The trials
were mixed and pseudo-randomly assigned into 4 blocks,
with 5 familiarization trials followed by 1 test trial in each
block. On each familiarization trial, infants saw a creature
produced from the structure of one category shown in Table
1 with a white background lasting for 8000 msec and heard
a phrase starting at the onset of each trial. In label-defined
condition, a labeling phrase (e.g., “Look! This is a Flurp”)
was presented in each trial and lasted for approximately
2800 msec. However, in motion-defined condition, the
phrase was not labeled (e.g., “Look at this one!). The feet of
the creature moved after the phrase and the motion lasted
for 3000 msec. The onset of motion in motion-defined
condition was approximately the same as that of label in

Novelty Preference Scores
To examine how labels or patterns of motion affected
infants’ categorization, a novelty preference score was
calculated for each test trial: accumulated looking time to
the prototype from novel category divided by the overall
looking time for both stimuli. The main results are presented
in Figure 3. The data were submitted to a 4 (block: 1 vs. 2
vs.3 vs.4) by 2 (condition: label-defined vs. motion-defined)
mixed ANOVA, with block as a within-subjects factor and
condition as a between-subjects factor. There was a
significant main effect of condition, F(1, 28) = 11.51 MSE =
0.24, p < .01, ηp2 = 0.291, with infants looking substantially

longer to the novel category in motion-defined condition
compared to the label-defined condition. However, neither
the main effect of block (p = .45) nor the interaction
between block and condition (p = .34) was found.
Therefore, data were collapsed across blocks for each
condition and the results are presented in Figure 4. As
shown in Figure 4, infants looked significantly longer to the
novel category in motion-defined condition than in labeldefined condition, independent sample t(28) = 3.71, p < .01,
d = 1.44. In addition, infants’ novelty preference score was
significantly higher than chance in motion-defined condition

Patterns of Attention
To determine if moving feet served as an engager and
pushed infants’ attention to other features, we compared the
accumulated looking time to the stimuli on familiarization
trials in two conditions. The gaze data (accumulated looking
time) were submitted to a 4 (block: 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4) by 2
(condition: label-defined vs. motion-defined) mixed

285

ANOVA, with block as a within-subjects factor and
condition as a between-subjects factor. Results revealed a
main effect of block, F(3, 84) = 12.87, MSE = 0.00, p < .01,
ηp2 = 0.315, with infants’ accumulated looking time
decreasing through blocks. However, infants’ accumulated
looking time did not differ between label-defined and
motion-defined conditions, p = .44.
Because the comparable accumulated looking during
familiarization trials resulted in different outcomes of
category learning in two conditions, we deemed it necessary
to examine how attention was distributed among different
features of the stimuli at both familiarization and test. The
proportion of looking time to different features on both
familiarization (averaged across five trials within each
block) and test trials (averaged across old and new
prototypes) were calculated and the data were submitted to
two separate 4 (feature: head1 vs. body vs. hands vs. feet) by
4 (block: 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4) by 2 (condition: label-defined
vs. motion-defined) mixed ANOVAs, with feature and
block as within-subjects factors and condition as a betweensubjects factor. For familiarization trials, because there was
no main effect of block (p = .16), these data were collapsed
across four blocks. As shown in Figure 5, there was an
interaction between feature and condition, F(3, 84) = 44.74,
MSE = 0.80, p < .01, ηp2 = 0.615. Infants’ accumulated more
looking to the head in label-defined condition compared to
motion-defined condition, independent sample t(27.7) =
6.46, p < .01, d = 2.25; whereas they looked significantly
longer at the feet, independent sample t(13.4) = 9.9, p < .01,
d = 4.45, and the hands, independent sample t(25.2) = 3.40,
p < .01, d = 1.14, in motion-defined condition than in labeldefined condition. Infants accumulated comparable looking
to body in both conditions, p = .91. Since the label and the
moving feet were not presented for the entire 8-second trial
in training, we further examined infants’ pattern of attention
by comparing their accumulated looking to each feature in
the first half of the trial to that in the second half of the trial.
Data were submitted to two 4 (feature: head vs. body vs.
hands vs. feet) by 2 (time course: 1st half vs. 2nd half)
repeated measures ANOVAs for the label-defined and
motion-defined conditions respectively. As shown in Figure
6, in the label-defined condition, there was a main effect of
feature, F(3, 51) = 43.25, MSE = 1.63, p < .01, ηp2 = 0.718,
and an interaction between feature and time course, F(3, 51)
= 5.74, MSE = 0.02, p < .01, ηp2 = 0.253. Infants looked
significantly longer at the head in both of the 1st and 2nd half
of the familiarization trial, Bonferroni ps < .01, but shorter
at the feet, ps < .05. In the motion-defined condition, as
shown in Figure 7, there was a main effect of feature, F(3,
33) = 42.63, MSE = 0.46, p < .01, ηp2 = 0.795, and an
interaction between feature and time course, F(3, 33) =
57.67, MSE = 0.79, p < .01, ηp2 = 0.840. In contrast to
infants who biased to the head in the label-defined
condition, infants’ looking was more widely distributed in
the motion-defined condition: they looked longer at the
moving feet during the first 4-second familiarization trial,
1

Bonferroni ps < .01, but they looked longer at the body and
head during the latter half of familiarization trial (looking
time: body > head > feet > hand; only for the last pair,
Bonferroni p < .01).
Similar analyses were conducted to examine the patterns
of attention on test trials (recall that neither labels nor
motion was presented during these trials). Since there was
no main effect of block (p = .42), the data were collapsed
across blocks and results are presented in Figure 8. Similar
to familiarization, there was an interaction between feature
and condition, F(3, 84) = 4.94, MSE =0.18, p < .01, ηp2 =
0.150. Infants looked longer at the head in label-defined
condition compared to motion-defined condition,
independent sample t(28) = 2.87, p < .01, d = 1.11.
However, there was little evidence that infants in motiondefined condition just focused on feet to categorize; their
looking instead was more widely distributed across the
features, ps > .24.

Discussion
In the study reported here, we investigated the role of labels
in infants’ categorization by comparing effects of labels
with those of highly salient visual features. By using a
combination of eye tracking and a more traditional novelty
preference paradigm, we examined the patterns of attention
and the outcome of category learning.
The current study reveals several important findings.
First, infants exhibited better category learning when they
saw a salient visual feature (i.e., moving feet) compared to
when they heard a label. Second, although infants
accumulated comparable looking during learning in motiondefined condition compared label-defined condition, their
attention was more distributed among different features
when there was a salient visual feature whereas they spent
most of their time looking at the head when they heard a
label. Third, there was little evidence of labels facilitating
category learning in infants.
Many studies have examined the role of labels in infants’
categorization and there is little agreement on the role of
labels being category markers or features. However, none of
the studies examining the effects of labels on categorization
in infancy demonstrated that these effects are greater than
those of highly salient features. By comparing the outcome
of category learning and examining the patterns of attention
in label-defined and motion-defined conditions, the current
study has provided new evidence as to how labels may
affect category learning in infancy. The results indicate that
a pattern of motion has a greater facilitative effect on
category learning than the label.
The current study raises an interesting question about the
role of labels in infants’ categorization by comparing the
effects of label to those of a salient feature and the results
suggest the labels may start out as features rather than
category markers. Future research will examine whether
labels merely fail to facilitate category learning or they
actually hinder infants’ category learning in infancy.
