Abstract

(2010) showed that there are two types of complacency: fixation and attention failures. Fixation failure occurs when the
automation failure is out of the users’ sight. Attention failure
occurs when the automation failure is within the users’ sight,
but out of their attention.

In this study, we experimentally investigated the relationship
between complacency, defined as missing automation malfunctions, anomalous conditions, or outright failures, and the
human tendency to prefer either automation or manual operation. We experimented using two different tasks with human
participants to evaluate their individual tendencies to lapse
into complacency and to use automation. The result indicated
that the participants who prefer manual operation also tend to
lapse into complacency. We assume that participant vigilance
against automation stability might link these two phenomena.

Introduction
Progress in technology has provided many opportunities for
people to use automation systems, including on airplanes,
ships, and in automobiles (Parasuraman, Molloy, & Singh,
1993; MacFadden, Giesbrecht, & Gula, 1998; Rajaonah,
Tricot, Anceaux, & Millot, 2008). Parasuraman and Riley (1997) defined automation as technology that performs
actions for humans. Human workload can be reduced by
automation; however, the automation performance is often
degraded by sudden environmental changes and automation
malfunctions. Therefore, using automation is not always efficient. In using such automation, complacency is one major problem encountered by people. Complacency is defined as missing automation malfunctions, anomalous conditions, or outright failures caused by inadequate monitoring
(Parasuraman & Manzey, 2010). Complacency causes fatal
accidents since users do not detect or are slow to detect automation failures (Parasuraman et al., 1993).
Parasuraman and Manzey (2010) described why complacency happens. They stated that in multi-task situations
where users allocate one task to automation and perform
the other tasks by themselves, they need to manually conduct their tasks while monitoring the allocated automated
task performance. In such situations, the manual tasks compete with the automated task for the user attention, and users
tend to concentrate on their manual tasks instead of the automated task. Therefore, the frequency of monitoring automation is lowered, and users often fail or become slow to detect automation failures. Moreover, Parasuraman and Manzey

Many studies about complacency have experimentally investigated fixation failure with multi-task situations where the
automated and manual tasks were displayed separately. The
participants conducted their own manual tasks while simultaneously monitoring the automated task. Automation breakdown occurred during the experiments. When automation
failure was detected, the participants had to push a particular button on their computer keyboards. Such task situations showed the following strong complacency effects: (1)
when the automation capability is stable rather than variable (Parasuraman et al., 1993), (2) when the workload is
high rather than low (Metzger & Parasuraman, 2005), and (3)
when the arousal level is low rather than high (Singh, Molloy,
& Parasuraman, 1993).
On the other hand, a few studies about complacency have
experimentally investigated attention failure. Duley, Westerman, Molloy, and Parasuraman (1997) set up the same multitask situation as in the previous studies about fixation failure,
but they superimposed the automated task on the manual task
on a single display. Automation breakdown also occurred
during the task. In their experiment, complacency occurred
on the superimposed display. They showed that even when
the automated task is in the users’ sight, complacency occurs
because they do not focus on the automated task.
The previous studies of human-automation system interaction, which experimentally investigated the human preference
to use automation or to conduct manual operation, indicated
individual differences in the selection. Lee and Moray (1992,
1994) showed that users who have a tendency to use automation, i.e., automation-oriented users, tend to trust automation. Rajaonah et al. (2008) showed that manual-oriented
users tend to perceive higher workload and greatly decrease their vigilance while monitoring automation more than
automation-oriented users. Additionally, Maehigashi, Miwa,
Terai, Kojima, and Morita (2011) showed that automation-

1960

oriented users tend to select whether to use automation or
manual operation by reacting more sensitively to the changes
of automation capabilities than manual-oriented users.
As indicated above, many studies have experimentally investigated the nature of human complacency in automation
usage and its orientation. However, no experimental investigations have focused on the relationship between these two
phenomena. In this study, we experimentally investigated the
relationship between complacency and a preference of automation usage. We drew the following hypotheses:
• Hypothesis 1: A relationship exists between complacency
and a preference for automation usage.
If Hypothesis 1 is supported, two detailed hypotheses are
raised. Lee and Moray (1992, 1994) showed that users who
tend to use automation also tend to trust it. Parasuraman and
Manzey (2010) argued that overtrust in automation may lower
the frequency of monitoring it, causing complacency. Therefore, it is predicted that automation-oriented users will detect
automation failures more slowly than manual-oriented users.
Therefore, Hypothesis 2a is as follows:
• Hypothesis 2a: Users who prefer to use automation tend to
lapse into complacency.
On the other hand, Rajaonah et al. (2008) showed that
users who tend to conduct manual operation tend to greatly
decrease vigilance while monitoring automation more than
automation-oriented users. Vigilance is the ability to sustain
attention, and a lack causes complacency (Molloy & Parasuraman, 1996). Therefore, it is predicted that users who tend to
conduct manual operation will tend to detect automation failures slower than automation-oriented users. Therefore, Hypothesis 2b is as follows:

is higher. However, deviation from the normative behavior is
caused by the participant tendencies to use automation. We
evaluated their preferences to use automation based on the
percentage of using the auto mode in the auto-manual selection task.
The second was a supervisory control task (Figure 1). We
evaluated participant tendencies to lapse into complacency
based on their performances on a dual task shown on a single display. One was a search task in which the participants
looked for target stimuli (L) among distracter stimuli (T) that
scroll downward. When the target was found on the screen,
the participants pressed a selector on the keyboard while the
target is inside the double line (detection area) at the display’s
bottom. If the target is successfully detected, the color of the
target letter changes to red. When the participants missed the
target or gave a false alarm, the performance score was reduced as operational error. We manipulated the number of
target and distracter stimuli for high and low workload conditions in the experiment.
The other supervisory control task was a monitoring one.
The participants monitored an auto that operates a circle vehicle to track a line. The line scrolls downward past the circle
vehicle. When the circle vehicle veers off the line, the performance score is reduced as operational error. Basically, the
auto perfectly performs the line tracking. However, in specific timing, auto failures occur and the circle vehicle stops
tracking the line during the task. When the participants detect the auto failures, they need to manually operate the circle vehicle by pressing the left and right arrow keys. In the
supervisory control task, the participants simultaneously conducted these two search and monitoring tasks. We evaluated
their tendency to become complacent based on their reactions
to the auto failures.

• Hypothesis 2b: Users who prefer manual operation tend to
become complacent.

Experimental task
We used two different experimental tasks. The first was the
auto-manual selection task used by Maehigashi et al. (2011).
We evaluated participant preferences to use automation based
on their performances in this task, where they tracked a line
that scrolls downward past a circle vehicle. When the circle
vehicle veers off the line, the performance score is reduced as
operational error. The participants were allowed to switch to
either auto mode (operation completely performed by the program) or manual mode (operation performed by participants
using left and right arrow keys) by pressing a selector on the
keyboard. We manipulated the auto and manual capabilities
with five levels, and the auto and manual capabilities changed
independently. The participants had to compare the auto and
manual capabilities to select the mode that shows higher task
performance (see Maehigashi et al. (2011) for details). It is
preferable to select the auto mode when the auto capability
is higher and the manual mode when the manual capability

Experiment
Method
Participants Thirty-five university students participated in
our experiment.
Factorial design In the supervisory control task, the experiment had a two-factor within participants design: (1) workload (high and low) and (2) type of failure (sudden and gradual). For the workload factor, 100 target and 400 distracter
stimuli in the high workload condition and 25 target and 100
distracter stimuli in the low workload condition emerged during the task. For the type of failure factor, in the sudden

1961

failure condition, the auto that has perfectly operated the circle vehicle suddenly stops because its capability suddenly becomes 0. The breakdown continues for 10 seconds. The circle
vehicle that tracks the line suddenly stops moving and immediately veers off the line. In the gradual failure condition, the
auto gradually stops operating because its capability gradually decreases to 0 for 40 seconds. The breakdown continues
for 10 seconds. The circle vehicle that tracks the line gradually slows down and finally veers off the line.
Procedure Prior to the supervisory control task, we conducted an auto-manual selection task whose procedure was
basically the same as in Maehigashi et al. (2011). First, the
participants practiced conducting the task in two training trials. Next we conducted an experimental task that consisted
of 25, 40-second trials. The auto and manual capabilities randomly changed among five levels during the task. When one
trial ended and another began, the display showed “capabilities changed” at the center of the screen. Throughout the
experiment, the values of the auto and manual capabilities
were not displayed on the screen. The participants were required to achieve as high a score as possible. They were given
a five-minute break after the auto-manual selection task was
completed.
After the break, we conducted the supervisory control task.
In the training trials, the participants first separately practiced
conducting the search and monitoring tasks and then experienced both simultaneously. Each training trial lasted one
minute. After the training trials, we conducted the experimental task that consisted of two blocks of nine trials each.
One block was conducted in the high workload condition and
the other in the low workload condition. The order of the
workload conditions was counterbalanced among the participants. The auto failures occurred three times in each block.
Sudden failure occurred 40 seconds after the second trial began. Gradual failures occurred from the beginning of the fifth
(or sixth) and the ninth trials. The participants were required
to operate the circle vehicle manually when auto failure occurred. However, participants were not informed about either types, the frequency, or the timing of the auto failure.
When the auto capability recovered after the auto failures,
the display showed “capability recovered” at the center of the
screen. The participants were instructed to delegate the operation back to the auto after the recovery. Throughout the
experiment, the manual capability was stable and sufficient
to manually track the line.

Result
Manipulation check In the auto-manual selection task, for
all participants, the mean percentage of using the auto mode
was 44.20%, and the mean task performance (the percentage the circle vehicle was on the line) was 75.02%. In the
search task of the supervisory control task, the mean number of missed targets was 0.28 in the high workload condition and 0 in the low workload condition. The mean number of false alarms was 0.67 in the high workload condition
and 0.31 in the low workload condition. Since the numbers of missed targets and false alarms were quite low, the
participants conducted the search task almost perfectly. We
conducted t-tests on the numbers of missed targets and false
alarms in the high and low workload conditions. The number
of missed targets was significantly higher in the high workload condition (t(34) = 2.53, p < .05), and the number of
false alarms was marginally higher in the high workload condition (t(34) = 1.77, p = .09). These results confirmed that
the workload was higher in the high workload condition than
in the low workload condition.
Evaluation index We evaluated the participant preferences
to use automation based on the percentage of using the auto
mode in the auto-manual selection task. We evaluated the
participant tendencies to lapse into complacency in the supervisory control task based on three evaluation indices: reaction
time, distance, and accumulated distance. The reaction time
was the time (msecs) from when the auto failure began to
when the manual operation was first conducted. We utilized
the time from when the auto breakdown occurred for the sudden failure and the time from when the auto capability started
to decrease for the gradual failure. The distance (pixels) was
measured between the circle vehicle and the line when the
manual operation was first conducted during the auto failure.
A distance over 30 pixels means that the circle vehicle is out
of the line. The accumulated distance (pixels) is the distance
accumulated from when the auto failure began through when
the manual operation was first conducted. Table 1 shows the
mean reaction time, the distance, and the accumulated distance for all participants in each condition of the supervisory
control task.
Consistency of tendency to lapse into complacency Prior
to verification of the hypotheses, we investigated the consistency of the participant tendencies to lapse into complacency. We conducted correlation analyses on the individual

reaction times, distances, and accumulated distances across
the four conditions in the supervisory control task (Table 2).
The results showed similar correlations in each index. First,
there were correlations between the high and low workload
situations both in the sudden and gradual failure conditions.
The results suggest that the participants who reacted faster to
the auto failure in the high workload condition also reacted
faster in the low workload condition. This consistency was
observed only within the same type of auto failure. Moreover, there was a correlation between the sudden and gradual
failure situations in the high workload condition, suggesting
that the participants who reacted faster to the sudden failure
also reacted faster to the gradual failure but only in the high
workload condition.
The results of the correlation analyses in the supervisory
control task showed the consistency of the participant tendencies to lapse into complacency. However, we only found
consistency in the participant reactions to the different types
of auto failures in the high workload condition. In the low
workload condition, the number of search stimuli was low.
The participants may have allocated enough attention to monitoring the auto operation to easily detect the auto failure. On
the other hand, in the high workload condition, the participants probably had difficulty concentrating on the monitoring
activities. Therefore, individual differences in complacency
became salient only in the high workload condition.

Relationship between complacency and tendency to use
auto mode To verify the hypotheses, we conducted a correlation analysis on the relationship between the individual
reaction times, the distances, and the accumulated distances
in the supervisory control task and the individual percentage
of using the auto mode in the auto-manual selection task (Table 3). The results showed a correlation between each index
in the sudden failure situation of the supervisory control task
and the percentage of using the auto mode in the auto-manual
selection but only in the high workload condition (Figure 2).
The participants who had a tendency to conduct manual operation in the auto-manual selection task also tended to react
slowly to the auto failure in the supervisory control task. The
result supports Hypotheses 1 and 2b, but only in the sudden
failure situations when the workload was high.

Discussion
As a result of our experiments, we found a relationship between complacency and the tendency to prefer automation
or manual operation. The participants who tended to conduct manual operation in the auto-manual selection task also
tended to react to the automation failure slowly: they tended
to lapse into complacency. This result supported Hypotheses
1 and 2b, but only in the high workload and sudden failure
condition.
For the tendency to use automation, Rajaonah et al. (2008)

task (y-axis).
showed that users who prefer manual operation tend to perceive higher workload and greatly decrease their vigilance
while monitoring automation more than users who prefer to
use automation. They discussed the possibility that manualoriented users might try to avoid high workload and vigilance
decrement without using automation. As a result, the manualoriented participants in our study might tend not to use automation even when using it was efficient.
Next, for the effect of workload on complacency, the relation of the tendency to use automation in the auto-manual selection task and the reaction to the automation failure was detected only in the high workload condition of the supervisory
control task. Molloy and Parasuraman (1996) showed that
vigilance decrement is greater in the high workload condition than in the low workload condition. In our experiment’s
low workload condition, the number of search stimuli was
relatively low so the participants could allocate enough attention to the auto operation. Therefore, the manual-oriented
participants might be able to successfully manage vigilance

and quickly detect automation failure. On the other hand,
in the high workload condition, the vigilance decrement became greater for the manual-oriented participants, resulting
in slower detection of automation failure. That is the reason
that we could only detect a significant correlation in the high
workload condition.
Moreover, for the effect of automation failure types on
complacency, the consistency of the tendency to use automation in the auto-manual selection task and the reaction to automation failure was detected only in the sudden failure situation of the supervisory control task. Endsley (1995) stated
that individual differences in situation awareness influence individual decision making and the performances of actions.
Endsley (1996) also indicated a relationship between vigilance and situation awareness decrements. In our experiment,
in the gradual failure situation, the circle vehicle gradually
slowed down and finally veered off the line. Some participants quickly shifted to manual operation after they noticed
the irregular movement of the circle vehicle. Others might

1964

continue to monitor the auto operation until just before the
auto breakdown, anticipating that the circle vehicle would
veer off the line after a certain amount of time. In such a situation, we assume that the participant reactions were influenced
not only by individual differences in the awareness of the auto
failure but also such factors as decision making strategy and
action selections followed by awareness. By contrast, in the
sudden failure situation, the circle vehicle suddenly stopped
tracking the line and immediately veered off the line. In such
a situation, the individual differences in the awareness of the
auto failure directly influenced the participant reactions. As
a result, there is only a relationship between the tendency to
use automation and the reaction to the automation failure in
the sudden failure condition.
Finally, Lee and Moray (1992, 1994) showed that users
who tend to use automation tend to trust it. An overtrust
in automation might lower the frequency of monitoring it
and cause complacency (Parasuraman & Manzey, 2010).
Therefore, we predicted that automation-oriented users would
slowly detect automation failures. Contrary to our prediction, however, we found that manual-oriented users tended
to slowly detect the automation failures, rejecting Hypothesis 2a. In our experiment, to evaluate the participant tendencies to lapse into complacency, we set up a situation where
attention failure–not fixation failure–was induced using a superimposed display. Perhaps in such a situation, individual
differences in vigilance rather than trust in automation link
complacency and the tendency to use automation.
In this study, we investigated the relationship between
complacency and the tendency to select whether to use automation or conduct manual operation. We evaluated complacency with a supervisory control task in which attention
failure was induced. We evaluated the preference to use automation with an auto-manual selection task. Our experiment
indicated that users who tend to conduct manual operation
tend to lapse into complacency. However, such a relationship
was found only in the high workload situation where sudden
automation failure occurs. We assume that individual differences in vigilance link complacency and the tendency to use
automation.
