along a continuum from such psychologically healthy
individuals to those diagnosed with schizophrenia (Claridge,
1985). Those high in schizotypy are described as psychosisprone, and may experience oddities of belief, behaviour,
eccentricities, idiosyncratic speech, peculiar ideas, and
social awkwardness or aversion at a subclinical level
(Siever, Kalus & Keefe, 1993). High schizotypes have been
studied in order to gain understanding of vulnerabilities to
schizophrenia (Peters, Pickering & Hemsley, 1994). Indeed,
in the presence of sufficient environmental stressors, the
contention is that high schizotypes may develop
schizophrenia, and present with appropriate clinical
symptoms.
High schizotypes therefore provide the researcher with a
compelling opportunity to examine ‘disordered’ cognition in
an otherwise healthy population. However, there have been
relatively few studies of categorisation in high and low
schizotypes, and what data there are appear inconsistent.

Abstract
Disorders provide an important source of information in
developing theories of normal categorisation. Disruption in
categorisation in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia
has been widely evidenced. However, findings are often
contradictory and subject to significant confounds. In the
present study 35 high schizotypes and 35 low scorers
completed a semantic categorisation task and a borderline
categorisation task, with measures of category membership
judgment, similarity and response time being taken. Results
revealed that high schizotypes made significantly fewer
positive category membership judgments than low
schizotypes (p = .003) and suggest that different theoretical
explanations may be required to explain the categorisation of
high and low schizotypes. Explanations in terms of theories of
normal categorisation are developed.

Introduction
Disorders of categorisation are an important source of
information in developing theories of normal categorisation.
Work on category-specific impairment, for example, has led
to the proposal that functional and appearance attributes are
represented in concepts in different ways (cf. Strnad,
Anzellotti & Caramazza, 2011).
Categorisation is known to be disrupted in other
disorders, most notably dementia (Doughty et al., 2009),
autism (Church et al., 2010), and schizophrenia (Doughty &
Done, 2009), as well as in neuropsychological cases (Cohen,
Johnston & Plunkett, 2000).
Schizophrenia has long been associated with the
suggestion that categorisation is subject to over-inclusion,
that category boundaries are shifted outward, incorporating
into the category items that would normally be regarded as
non-members (Lawrence, Doughty, Al-Mousawi, Clegg &
Done, 2007). However, disorders also present difficulties
for experimental investigations of categorisation. In the case
of schizophrenia, for example, significant confounds are
often present, such as hospitalisation, medication, psychosis,
and attentional dysfunction. Perhaps unsurprisingly, and in
spite of the prominence the suggestion of over-inclusion has
received, relatively little is actually known of categorisation
in schizophrenia. Moreover, the sparse evidence is often
inconsistent or contradictory.
However, schizophrenia has been linked theoretically to
schizotypy, a multidimensional construct that assumes
healthy individuals may manifest subclinical presentations
of schizophrenic symptoms. Schizotypy varies in degree

Semantic Processing in Schizophrenia
Abnormalities in semantic processing are thought to be
central to cognitive abnormalities in schizophrenia, with
deficits reported on a wide variety of semantic processing
tasks (Chen, Wilkins & McKenna, 1994). Further, semantic
deficits are suggested to underlie disturbances in thought
and language in schizophrenia, which might not only
explain deficits observed in other cognitive domains, but
also provide a cognitive explanation for common symptoms
in schizophrenia, such as delusions (Rossell, Rabe-Hesketh,
Shapleske & David, 1999) and thought disorder (GouzoulisMayfrank et al., 2003).

Semantic Processing in Schizotypy
Although impairments in attention (Lenzenweger, Cornblatt
& Putnick, 1991) and executive functioning (Suhr, 1997;
Tallent & Gooding, 1999) have been found in schizotypy,
few studies have addressed the relationship between
schizotypy and semantic processing. Those that have done
so have used semantic priming tasks (Beech, McManus,
Bayliss, Tipper & Agar, 1991; Morgan, Bedford & Rossell,
2006) and revealed differences between high and low
schizotypes (Morgan et al., 2006).
However, there has been little research on other areas of
semantic processing in schizotypy, Morgan, Bedford,
O’Reagan & Rossell (2009) being a notable exception. Very
few studies of schizotypy have included categorisation tasks
and none have made categorisation a primary focus.

Categorisation in Schizotypy
The majority of studies on categorisation in schizotypy have
used fluency tasks whereby participants are asked to
generate exemplars given a category label (Barrantes-Vidal
et al., 2003; Duchene, Graves & Brugger, 1998; Kiang &
Kutas, 2005). Fluency tasks are typically used to make
estimates of the semantic distance between pairs of
concepts. Although these provide a measure of the
organisation of semantic information, they do not address
the process of categorisation directly. Categorisation tasks,
which require participants to make category membership
judgments, have been used in only two studies (Kiang &
Kutas, 2005; Morgan et al., 2009).
Kiang & Kutas (2005) presented their participants with a
category definition followed by exemplars of varying
typicality and required them to judge whether or not each
was a category member. In their EEG study, no group
differences were found in the N400 component, although
they did report a negative correlation between schizotypy
score and ERP amplitude differences between category
members and non-members.
Morgan et al. (2009) asked participants to rate the
category membership of exemplars of varying degrees of
relatedness. Group differences were found only for low
frequency items, with high schizotypes regarding low
frequency exemplars as belonging less to the category than
did low schizotypes. Differences in the same direction were
reported as nearing significance for high frequency category
members and borderline exemplars.
Surprisingly, the authors did not comment on the contrast
between this apparent ‘under-inclusion’ and the overinclusion reported in schizophrenia. Indeed, despite the
suggestion that in schizophrenia categories are overincluded, there has been very little focus on this question in
relation to schizotypy. It is unclear whether differences in
categorisation between high and low schizotypes are
generally not reliable, or whether previous studies have not
been sufficiently sensitive to detect them.

Categorising Borderlines
Previous investigations of schizotypy have not examined the
relative contribution of different attributes to categorisation.
Yet characteristic and necessary features (cf. Rips, Shoben
& Smith, 1973) allow for the creation of two borderline
cases: exemplars with characteristic but not necessary
features and exemplars with necessary but not characteristic
features. Similar cases have been used in previous research,
for example, in debates as to whether categorisation is
similarity- or theory-based (e.g. Rips, 1989).
This study therefore consists of two tasks: a replication of
the semantic categorisation task reported by Morgan et al.
(2009) with the additional measures of response times, and
similarity ratings to better gauge whether categorisation in
schizotypy is characterised by over- or under-inclusion; and
a borderline categorisation task using two types of
borderline exemplars, as above, for artefact and natural kind
categories, with measures of categorisation and similarity

judgments, and response times, in order to shed light on the
ways in which category boundaries might be shifted.

Experiment
Method
Design
The study employed two tasks. In both, dependent variables
were categorisation (member, non-member), similarity
rating (1-7), and response time (ms).
Semantic categorisation This employed a 2 x 5 design with
one between-participants factor (Group [low, high]) and one
within-participants factor (Relatedness [high frequency, low
frequency, borderline, related but outside of the category,
unrelated]).
Borderline categorisation This employed a 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
design with one between-participants factor (Group [low,
high]) and three within-participants factors (Appearance [+,
-], Essence [+, -] and Category [artefact, food natural kinds,
non-food natural kinds]).

Participants
Two hundred and seventy eight participants were screened
using an online questionnaire, the Oxford-Liverpool
Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE: Mason,
Claridge & Jackson, 1995). Scores from the questionnaire
were used to determine high and low groups: high group (n
= 35), above the 70th percentile (≥ 44) and the low group (n
= 35), below the 30th percentile (≤ 29). The high group
consisted of 6 males and 29 females with a mean age of
25.83 (SD = 9.39) and the low group consisted of 9 males
and 26 females with a mean age of 27.54 (SD = 11.37).

Materials
O-LIFE The O-LIFE is a 159-item questionnaire based on
the Combined Schizotypal Traits Questionnaire (Bentall et
al., 1989) and is used to measure schizotypy. The O-LIFE
yields 4 factors: unusual experiences (e.g. ‘Do you think
that you could learn to read other’s minds if you wanted
to?’), cognitive disorganisation (e.g. ‘Are you easily
confused if too much happens at the same time?’),
introvertive anhedonia (e.g. ‘Are there very few things that
you have ever enjoyed doing?’), and impulsive
nonconformity (e.g. ‘Do you at times have an urge to do
something harmful or shocking?’).
Semantic categorisation The semantic categorisation task
replicates and extends the task reported by Morgan et al.
(2009). They had selected eighteen categories from the
norms of Battig and Montague (1969) and of Hampton and
Gardiner (1983): body parts, clothing, drinks, flowers, food
flavouring, furniture, insects, instruments, mammal, metal,
part of building, professions, reading material, sport, tools,
type of cloth, vehicle, and weapon. For each category,

2247

Morgan et al. (2009) identified 5 different exemplars of
differing degrees of relatedness, resulting in 90 trials, as
follows: (1) high frequency (e.g. leg for the category ‘body
part’), (2) low frequency (e.g. thumb), (3) borderline (e.g.
joint), (4) related but outside the category (e.g. wig), and
unrelated (e.g. cricket). To extend the replication, response
times (ms) and similarity ratings were also measured.
Borderline categorisation Based on Braisby (2004), this
task employed three types of category (food natural kinds,
non-food natural kinds and artefacts), with 4 different
categories for each: apple, chicken, potato and salmon for
food natural kinds; canary, dog, oak tree and rose for nonfood natural kinds; and car, fork, piano and sailboat for
artefacts. For each category, 4 different exemplars were
described, defined by the presence or absence of appearance
and essence properties, resulting in 48 trials. Exemplars
were presented in scenarios and were defined by having: (1)
appearance properties absent, essence properties absent (AE-), (2) appearance properties absent, essence properties
present (A-E+), (3) appearance properties present, essence
properties absent (A+E-), and (4) appearance properties
present, essence properties present (A+E+). The following
is an example of how stimuli were presented in scenario
form for the category ‘apple’, for the exemplar type (A+E-).

the borderline categorisation task, category membership
judgments, category membership judgment response times,
similarity ratings and similarity rating response times were
all averaged over the four categories belonging to each
superordinate category.
A series of 2 x 5 ANOVAs were conducted to examine
category membership judgments, category membership
judgment response times, similarity ratings and similarity
rating response times.

Semantic Categorisation
Critically, no group differences were found for measures of
category membership judgment, similarity judgment or
response times, nor did any approach significance (all p >
.3). Thus Morgan et al.’s (2009) key finding of group
differences for low frequency items was not supported.
Consistent with their findings, however, the main effect of
relatedness was significant for category membership
judgments [F(2.82, 191.80) = 1613.00, p < .001, partial η2 =
.96] and similarity ratings [F(2.52, 171.27) = 1558.00, p <
.001, partial η2 = .96], with both ratings increasing with
semantic relatedness (see Figure 1).

genetic properties specific to apples. Upon examination,
you find that it looks, feels, smells and even tastes JUST

Procedure
Participants completed both tasks and stimuli were
presented and responses recorded using E-Prime (Schneider,
Eschman & Zuccolotto, 2002). The order of tasks was
counterbalanced.
Semantic categorisation Participants were required to read
the exemplar and category names and make a similarity
judgment, and then a category membership judgment (Yes
or No). Practice examples were used.
Borderline categorisation The scenario appeared on screen
and participants were required to make a similarity
judgment, and then a category membership judgment (Yes
or No). Practice examples were used.

(left axis) and mean similarity ratings (right axis) for each
level of relatedness.
Examining response times, as expected, the main effect of
relatedness was also significant for category membership
judgments [F(2.74, 186.32) = 17.22, p < .001, partial η2 =
.20] and similarity ratings [F(3.37, 229.10) = 43.91, p <
.001, partial η2 = .39]. These results support previous
findings with categorisation response times following an
inverted V-shaped function: response times increase as the
semantic distance between the category and the exemplar
increases to the boundary, and decrease with increasing
semantic distance (Rips et al., 1973).

Results
For both semantic categorisation and the borderline
categorisation task, category membership judgments were

.196, r = .16]. Thus, the low schizotypes tended to give a
higher proportion of positive categorisation judgments than
high schizotypes when essence properties were present.
However, these conclusions must be tempered due to the
possibility of a floor effect (i.e. in the [A-E-] condition).

Category membership judgments Critically, the main
effect of group was significant [F(1, 68) = 9.52, p = .003,
partial η2 = .12], with high schizotypes providing
significantly fewer positive category membership judgments
(M = .43) than low schizotypes (M = .52).
The category by appearance interaction was significant
[F(1.70, 115.31) = 12.03, p < .001, partial η2 = .15, HuynhFeldt corrected here and elsewhere] and contrasts revealed
significant interactions when comparing artefacts to food
natural kinds [F(1, 68) = 15.48, p < .001, partial η2 = .19]
and artefacts to non-food natural kinds [F(1, 68) = 13.80, p
< .001, partial η2 = .17]. The effect of appearance properties
was greater for food (0.44) and non-food (0.43) natural
kinds than it was artefact categories (0.29).
The category by essence interaction was also significant
[F(1.68, 113.98) = 30.04, p < .001, partial η2 = .31].
Contrasts revealed significant interactions when comparing
artefacts to food natural kinds [F(1, 68) = 41.50, p < .001,
partial η2 = .38], and artefacts to non-food natural kinds
[F(1, 68) = 31.31, p < .001, partial η2 = .32]. The effect of
essence properties was greater for artefact categories (0.68)
than both food (0.43) and non-food (0.46) natural kinds.
Similar effects were obtained for similarity ratings. Taken
together, these results imply that overall participants
essentialised artefact categories more strongly than they did
the food or non-food natural kinds, for which the influence
of appearance properties was equally strong.
There was a significant three-way interaction between
appearance, essence and group [F(1, 68) = 8.02, p = .006,
partial η2 = .11]. Pairwise comparisons revealed differences
nearing significance between the high group (M = .895, SE
= .038) and low group (M = .974, SE = .015) for [A+E+]
exemplars [t(68) = 1.94, p = .059, r = .23] and between the
high group (M = .462, SE = .062) and the low group (M =

influenced by appearance properties than low schizotypes
(0.24) when categorising artefacts. However, low
schizotypes (0.49) were more influenced by appearance
properties than high schizotypes (0.39) in categorising food
natural kinds.

Category judgment response times Importantly, the main
effect of group was not significant [F(1, 68) = .54, p = .465,
partial η2 = .008] suggesting that the difference in
categorisation judgments does not stem from a speedaccuracy trade-off. The category by group interaction was
significant [F(1.91, 129.53) = 3.40, p = .039, partial η2 =
.048]. Contrasts revealed a significant interaction when
comparing the high schizotypy group and low group
response times for the artefact and the non-food natural kind
categories [F(1, 68) = 5.27, p = .025, partial η2 = .072]. For
the artefact category, response times were similar for the
low group and the high group, however for the non-food
natural kinds category response times decreased for the high
group and increased for the low group. Pairwise
comparisons revealed differences nearing significance
between artefact categories (M = 1508, SE = 126.3) and
non-food categories (M = 1895, SE = 215.6) for the low
group [t(34) = -1.98, p = .056, r = .32], while those between
artefact categories (M = 1612, SE = 203.5) and non-food
categories (M = 1492, SE = 178.5) for the high group were
not significant [t(68) = 1.18, p = .247, r = .20].
Similarity ratings The main effect of group was not
significant [F(1, 68) = .008, p = .928, partial η2 = .000] nor
were there any significant interactions involving group.

Discussion
The current research aimed to explore over- or underinclusion in categorisation in schizotypy by (a) utilising
more sensitive measures of categorisation (i.e. similarity
ratings and response times) than in previous studies and (b)
utilising borderline exemplars.

Semantic Categorisation
Kiang and Kutas (2005) used only high and low frequency,
and unrelated exemplars, and found no group differences.
Morgan et al. (2009) used similar stimuli, taken from
similar norms (Battig & Montague, 1969; Hampton &
Gardiner, 1983), as well as borderline and related
exemplars, and found group differences. The present study
found no group differences, and so it remains unclear where
the locus of any group difference, if such exists, might lie.

Borderline Categorisation
In contrast, the borderline categorisation task provides some
limited support for the findings by Morgan et al. (2009).
Consistent with their findings, high schizotypes provided
significantly fewer positive category judgments than the low
group – that is high schizotypes show evidence of underinclusion. It is possible that the semantic categorisation task
is too insensitive to reliably reveal group differences, and
that the borderlines task, which focuses attention on cases
whose categorisation is uncertain, is more sensitive.
That the group difference appears localised to exemplars
possessing essential properties suggests that low schizotypes
may be more essentialist, making positive category
judgments more readily when essential properties are

present. For both groups, the effect of appearance properties
was greater for natural kinds than it was for artefact
categories, and the effect of essence properties was greater
for artefact categories than for natural kinds. At least for
these participants and these stimuli, the artefact categories
appear to be more strongly essentialised.
Finally, it is interesting that no group differences emerged
in response times on the semantic categorisation task.
Morgan et al. (2009) reported that they may have revealed
group differences as they used shorter SOAs than Kiang and
Kutas (2005), thus increasing task demands. It is possible
that increasing the demands of the semantic categorisation
task would render it more sensitive to group differences.
The data support previous findings that have shown an
inverted V-shaped function in categorisation times (Chen et
al., 1994; Rips et al., 1973). Again, no group differences
were noted, suggesting that group differences in
categorisation in the Morgan et al. (2009) study were not
due to high schizotypes requiring more time to categorise.

Explaining Group Differences
As indicated, one possible explanation for the fact that high
schizotypes provided fewer positive category judgments
than the low group, and fewer positive category judgments
for both types of borderline exemplar, is that they weighed
less heavily the presence of essential properties.
Alternatively, they may have operated with a stricter
definition or higher threshold for category membership than
low schizotypes, with the categorisation of high schizotypes
being more similarity-based.
Essence properties were only present in the [A-E+]
borderline exemplars and on this basis these exemplars
should have received more positive category membership
judgments if participants were essentialist. As noted above,
it appears as though artefact categories were more strongly
essentialised. It also appears as though the low group were
more essentialist, as [A-E+] borderlines were categorised
more positively by the low than by the high group.
Of course, as this is one of the few studies to directly
examine the relationship between schizotypy and
categorisation, these data are unlikely to be decisive as
regards extant theories of concepts. Further work is needed
to confirm these findings, possibly including meta-analytic
studies that offer the prospect of considerably greater
statistical power. Nevertheless, it is possible that the
categorisation of high and low schizotypes may require
somewhat different theories, with those of high schizotypes
being more similarity-based, and those of low schizotypes
being more essentialist. Although the current study is not
able to adjudicate between different theoretical frameworks,
it does suggest the promise of further studies of schizotypy
and categorisation in helping to do so.
