Abstract
People make logically inconsistent probability judgments.
The “Linda” problem is a well-known example, which often
elicits a conjunction/disjunction fallacy: probability of constituent event A (B) judged more/less likely than their conjunction/disjunction. The Quantum Judgment model (QJM,
Busemeyer et al 2011) explains such errors, which are not explainable within classical probability theory. We propose an
alternative axiomatic approach in the framework of quantum
probability theory that employs positive operators representing the set of general queries, in constast to QJM which uses
projection operators. Like QJM, our model accounts for conjunction/disjunction fallacies, averaging type errors, and unpacking effects, suggesting that it provides a viable model of
judgement error. Further differences between our model and
QJM are also discussed.
Keywords: Probability judgment; Quantum Probability theory; conjunction/disjunction fallacy; “Linda” problem.

Introduction
People make probability judgments that are logically inconsistent with classical probability theory. The “Linda” problem
is a well-known example: Participants are told that Linda was
a philosophy student and an anti-nuclear supporter, and asked
to judge her most likely current situation as either (a) feminist supporter, (b) bank teller, (c) feminist and bank teller—
conjunction, (d) feminist, but not bank teller, or (e) feminist
or bank teller—disjunction. Judging (b) as more likely than
(c) is a conjunction error (fallacy), since by classical probability Prob(A and B) ≤ Prob(B); judging (a) as more likely
than (e) is a disjunction error, since Prob(A) ≤ Prob(A or B).
These fallacies are well-known (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983;
Bar-Hillel & Neter, 1993), but they are not explained by
classical models (Busemeyer, Pothos, Franco, & Trueblood,
2011).
Busemeyer et al. (2011) proposed an alternative model
based on quantum probability theory (QPT) (Peres, 1993).
Their quantum judgment model (QJM) uses the properties of
quantum coherence and quantum interference to explain conjunction and disjunction errors, respectively. An explanation
of QJM follows (Appendix A summarizes QPT).
Using the Linda problem as an example, QJM assumes that
beliefs about states of the world (e.g., Linda is a feminist)
are represented as vectors Ψ in a Hilbert space H where,
e.g., the basis vectors represent feature combinations (e.g.,
non-/feminist, young/old, gay/straight). An event E (e.g.,
corresponding to the proposition Linda is a bank-teller) is

a projection operator, which projects the belief vector onto
a subspace representing a possible outcome: e.g., Yes is a
possible outcome (subspace) for Linda is a bank-teller. A
projection operator E applied to Ψ, written EΨ (i.e. vector/matrix multiplication), returns the probability of belief
in that outcome, computed as Prob(E) = hΨ|EΨi, where
h·|·i is Dirac notation for the inner product. For events corresponding to conjunctions of propositions “E and F” (e.g.,
Linda is a feminist and Linda is a bank-teller), the belief
in an outcome is computed as: if Prob(E) > Prob(F), then
Prob(E and F) = hΨ|EFEΨi, else if Prob(E) < Prob(F),
then hΨ|FEFΨi.1
In this paper, we provide an alternative formulation of human probability judgment within the framework of quantum
probability theory. The most general class of queries is represented by the space of positive operators, which includes projection operators. Motivated by this observation, we propose
a set of axioms to define a positive operator corresponding to
the conjunction of a pair of general propositions. We provide
an example that is consistent with this set of axioms. Moreover, we also show how this reformulation accounts for the
conjunction and disjunction fallacies, averaging type errors,
and unpacking effects.

Quantum formulation using positive operators
A quantum system is described by a Hilbert space (see Appendix A). In quantum theory, a general query (or event) is
represented by an operator A satisfying 0 ≤ A ≤ 1. It should
be noted that a projection operator also satisfies this condition. Thus an observable which takes a value in a set Ω is
represented by a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM)
{Aa }a∈Ω on Ω. Roughly, a POVM can be regarded as a
“fuzzy” version of projection-valued measure (PVM). Thus
a POVM is often called an unsharp observable.
Assumption 1 A person’s belief state is described by a state
of a quantum system.
We denote a Hilbert space by H .
Assumption 2 An event that has a family of possible outcomes Ω is described by a family of positive operators E =
{Ei }i∈Ω on H that satisfies ∑i∈Ω Ei = 1. (Such a family of
positive operators is called a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM).)

and F) is undefined when Prob(E) = Prob(F).

In the above formulation, an operator corresponding to a
proposition “A and B” is not specified. To give quantitative predictions, however, this operator needs to be specified.
We take an axiomatic approach to identify a suitable operator. Let us denote the operator corresponding to “A and
B” by Λ(A, B). We assume that for a pair of POVMs {Aa }
and {Bb }, an operator corresponding to “Aa and Bb ” does
not depend on Ac ’s (c 6= a) and Bd ’s (d 6= b). That is, Λ
is defined as a map Λ : E+ (H ) × E+ (H ) → E+ (H ), where
E+ (H ) := {A| 0 ≤ A ≤ 1}. It is natural to suppose that this
Λ satisfies the following conditions:

instance, we do not require “A and B” to be equivalent with
“B and A”.
Before showing the existence of a Λ satisfying these requirements, we show a proposition easily derived from them.
Proposition 1 Suppose Λ satisfies the requirements (o.b) (iv.b). It holds that for any projections P and Q satisfying P +
Q ≤ 1, Λ(P, Q) = 0, and for any A with 0 ≤ A ≤ 1, Λ(A, 0) =
0.
Proof: Let us begin with Λ(P, Q) = 0 for projections P and
Q with P + Q ≤ 1. We can define a PVM {A0 , A1 , A2 } :=
{P, Q, 1 − P − Q}, Considering ∑a,b Λ(Aa , Ab ) = 1, we obtain

(o.b) Λ(A, B) satisfies 0 ≤ Λ(A, B) ≤ 1 for any A, B ∈
E+ (H ).
(i.b) For any POVMs {Aa } and {Bb }, it holds that
∑a,b Λ(Aa , Bb ) = 1. (Thus, {Λ(Aa , Bb )} becomes a
POVM.)
(ii.b) Λ(A, A) = A for any projection A.
(iii.b) Λ(A, 1) = A for any A ∈ E+ (H ).

P + Q + (1 − P − Q) + Λ(P, Q) + Λ(Q, P)
+Λ(P, 1 − P − Q) + Λ(1 − P − Q, P)
+Λ(Q, 1 − P − Q) + Λ(1 − P − Q, Q) = 1,
where we used Conditions (i.b) and (ii.b). It concludes
Λ(P, Q) = 0.
Consider a POVM {A, 1 − A} and {1, 0}. Condition (i.b)
and (iii.b) are used to show
Λ(A, 1) + Λ(A0 , 1) + Λ(A, 0) + Λ(A0 , 0)

(iv.b) Λ(UAU ∗ ,UBU ∗ ) = UΛ(A, B)U ∗ for any A, B ∈ E+ (H )
and any unitary operator U.
Some comments are helpful to understand each condition.
Condition (o.b) is necessary to guarantee that the framework
is closed under conjunction and well-defined. Condition (i.b)
means that summation of the probabilities “Aa and Bb ” for
running a and b is 1. Condition (ii.b) represents a trivial
requirement. A proposition “Linda is a feminist and Linda
is a feminist” is equivalent to “Linda is a feminist”. A restriction of A in condition (ii.b) may seem strange. However,
even in a classical system, confirming that a fuzzy query is
true does not guarantee that the same query is true. Therefore we impose a weaker condition than the one above. 1
in condition (iii.b) represents a trivial proposition such as
“Linda is Linda”. This condition implies that the proposition “Linda is a feminist and Linda is Linda” is equivalent
to “Linda is a feminist”. Condition (iv.b) may need a detailed explanation. It means that an operator corresponding to “A and B” should be determined only by the interrelationship between A and B. In quantum theory, the relationship between A and B is exactly the same as that between
UAU ∗ and UBU ∗ because unitary operation U can be interpreted as something like a “coordinate transformation”. Thus
Λ(UAU ∗ ,UBU ∗ ) should be written as a function of Λ(A, B)
and U. This function f (Λ(A, B),U) := Λ(UAU ∗ ,UBU ∗ )
must satisfy f (Λ(A, B),UV ) = f ( f (Λ(A, B),V ),U). Now we
have f (Λ(U ∗ AU, 1),U) = Λ(UU ∗ AU ∗U, 1) = Λ(A, 1). Using
condition (iii.b), we obtain for any A and U, f (U ∗ AU,U) = A.
Setting U ∗ AU = B for an arbitrary B, we obtain

= A + A0 + Λ(A, 0) + Λ(A0 , 0) = 1.
It concludes Λ(A, 0) = 0.
To illustrate the existence of Λ, let us consider the following
example.
Example 1 Fix 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. For any A, B satisfying 0 ≤ A ≤ 1
and 0 ≤ B ≤ 1, we define Λ p (A, B) by
Λ p (A, B) = pA1/2 BA1/2 + (1 − p)B1/2 AB1/2 .
Using 0 ≤ B ≤ 1, one can show 0 ≤ A1/2 BA1/2 ≤ 1. Thus
0 ≤ Λ p (A, B) ≤ 1 holds and condition (o.b) is satisfied. Let
us examine condition (i.b). Consider a pair of POVM {Aa }
and {Bb }. We obtain

Condition (ii.b) is satisfied because P1/2 PP1/2 = P holds for
a projection P. Condition (iii.b) also follows immediately. In
addition , it holds that
Λ p (UAU ∗ ,UBU ∗ )
= pUA1/2U ∗UBU ∗UA1/2U ∗
+(1 − p)UB1/2U ∗UAU ∗UB1/2U ∗

f (B,U) = UBU .
Thus it holds that Λ(UAU ∗ ,UBU ∗ ) = f (Λ(A, B),U) =
UΛ(A, B)U ∗ . Note that these conditions are rather weak. For

where we used U ∗U = 1. Thus condition (iv.b) is satisfied. .

Theorem 2 Let P and Q be propositions represented by projection operators. If there is no state violating

Thus we proved the following theorem.
Theorem 1 There exists Λ satisfying Conditions (o.b) (iv.b). (This Λ is not uniquely determined.)

Prob(P and Q) + Prob(P and Q0 ) = Prob(P)

Conjunction and Disjunction Fallacies

Prob(P and Q) + Prob(P0 and Q) = Prob(Q),

The remaining task is to show that there exists a Λ that accounts for the conjunction and disjunction fallacies. We take
Λ1/2 introduced in Example 1.
Let us consider a model described by a two-dimensional
Hilbert space H = C2 which has an orthonormalized basis e0
and e1 . A pair of PVMs A = {A0 , A1 } and B = {B0 , B1 } are
defined as An = |en ihen | and Bn = | fn ih fn | for n = 0, 1, where
f0 and f1 are defined by
f0

:=

√ (e0 − e1 ).

P and Q commute with each other.
Proof: If the above equations hold for arbitrary states, Λ
satisfies
Λ(P, Q) + Λ(P, Q0 ) = 1
Λ(P, Q) + Λ(P0 , Q) = 1
and vice versa. These equations mean that PVMs {P, 1 − P}
and {Q, 1 − Q} are jointly measurable. Hence, P and Q commute with each other (Miyadera, 2011).
Moreover, for general propositions, we have the following
theorem.

Let us consider a pure state described by a vector

Theorem 3 Let A and B be general propositions. If there is

The probability for each proposition is calculated as,

40 , Prob(A1 and B0 ) = Prob(Λ1/2 (A1 , B0 )) = 40 , and
1
Prob(B0 ) = 5 . They satisfy

Prob(A and B) + Prob(A and B0 ) = Prob(A)
Prob(A and B) + Prob(A0 and B) = Prob(B),
their intrinsic ambiguities defined by V (A) = kA − A2 k satisfy

Prob(A1 ) > Prob(A1 or B0 ) > Prob(A1 and B0 ) > Prob(B0 ).
Thus this example shows both conjunction and disjunction
fallacies. Note that conjunction and disjunction fallacies are
supported by other choices of Ψ. It is an important future
work to identify the relevant states.
In addition, Λ p (0 < p < 1) given by Example 1 is consistent with an observation of averaging type errors (Fantino,
Kulik, & Stolarz-Fantino, 1997). Consider two general
propositions A and B. Suppose that a state Ψ satisfies
Prob(A) = hΨ|AΨi > hΨ|BΨi = Prob(B). Then Prob(A) >
Prob(A and B) must follow. In fact, in our model it holds that
Prob(A and B)
= hΨ|Λ p (A, B)Ψi
=

phΨ|A1/2 BA1/2 Ψi + (1 − p)hΨ|B1/2 AB1/2 Ψi

≤

phΨ|AΨi + (1 − p)hΨ|BΨi

< hΨ|AΨi = Prob(A).
where we used B ≤ 1 and A ≤ 1.
Unpacking effect, in its broad sense, is interpreted as
a difference between Prob(A and B) + Prob(A and B0 ) and
Prob(A) (Rottenstreich & Tversky, 1997). That is, the law
of classical (Kolmogorov) probability,
Prob(A and B) + Prob(A and B0 ) = Prob(A)
is violated. We can show that this effect inevitably occurs
between noncommutative sharp propositions no matter how
we set Λ.

Discussion
In this paper, we provided an axiomatic formulation of human
probability judgment within the general framework of quantum probability theory. A concrete instantiation was found
that satisfies the axioms while accounting for the conjunctive/disjunctive fallacies, averaging type errors, and unpacking effects. We note, though, that QJM accounts for other
effects that we have not yet addressed, e.g., order effect.
Here, we comment on some differences between our approach and QJM. In contrast to Busemeyer’s model, our
POVM formalism does not require computing Pr(A) (nor
Pr(B)) to obtain Pr(A and B) because Λ(A, B) does not depend on a state. Also, in Busemeyer’s formalism an exhaustive set of conjunctions may not sum to 1 (see Appendix B),
whereas in our formalism the summation of probabilities is
set to 1 (see Axiom (i.b)). Finally, our formulation can be
naturally generalized to use mixed states. Further work is
needed to explore the implications of these differences.
Proponents of QPT-based approaches divorce themselves
from a commitment to the brain as a quantum device
(Busemeyer et al., 2011). As a descriptive theory of human

2016

probability of an outcome a ∈ Ω in a state ρ is given by
Prob(Aa ) = tr(ρAa ). A POVM {Aa } is called a projectionvalued measure (PVM) if Aa is a projection operator for each
a. PVMs are often treated as more fundamental objects because each POVM can be represented as a PVM in an enlarged space (Naimark extension theorem). In fact, the space
of projection operators can be regarded as a generalization of
the Boolean algebra.

judgment, one need not be committed to a quantum mechanical implementation. However, if a causal theory is sought—
ultimately so for a science of cognition, then a theory based
on QPT must be reconciled against the (lack of) evidence
showing that the brain is indeed a quantum device (but, see
Hameroff, 2002). An alternative to this predicament is to seek
yet a further generalization of the quantum framework, which
does not depend on quantum mechanics. General operational
probability theory (Dvurecenskij & Pulmannova, 2000) and
category theory (MacLane, 2000) are two possibilities for future investigation.

Appendix
Appendix A: Quantum Probability theory
A quantum system is described by a Hilbert space H , which
is a vector space (which we assume to be finite dimensional, i.e., dimH < ∞) over the complex field C that is
equipped with an inner product. The inner product h·|·i defines a map H × H → C satisfying: (i) hφ|c1 ψ1 + c2 ψ2 i =
c1 hφ|ψ1 i + c2 hφ|ψ2 i for all c1 , c2 ∈ C and φ, ψ1 , ψ2 ∈ H ; (ii)
hφ|ψi = hψ|φi∗ for all φ, ψ ∈ H ; and (iii) hφ|φi ≥ 0, and
H
hφ|φi = 0 ⇔ φ = 0. A family of vectors {ei }dim
i=1 is called
an orthonormalized basis of H , if it satisfies hei |e j i = 0 for
i 6= j and hei |ei i = 1 for all i. A linear map A : H → H is
called an operator. Every operator A is associated with a
unique operator A∗ satisfying hA∗ ψ|φi = hψ|Aφi (Riesz theorem); A∗ is called a conjugate operator of A. An operator
U satisfying UU ∗ = U ∗U = 1 is called a unitary operator.
An operator A satisfying A = A∗ is called a self-adjoint operator. A self-adjoint operator P satisfying P = P∗ = P2 is
called a projection operator. A self-adjoint operator A satisfying hψ|Aψi ≥ 0 for all ψ ∈ H is called a positive operator,
written as A ≥ 0, where 0 denotes a null operator. Every projection operator is a positive operator. For a positive operator A, A1/2 is defined as a unique positive operator satisfying
A1/2 A1/2 = A.
State and observable are central notions in any physical
theory. In quantum theory, a state is represented by a selfadjoint operator ρ, called a density operator, satisfying: (i)
ρ ≥ 0; and (ii) tr(ρ) = ∑i hei |ρei i = 1 for any orthonormal
basis—tr is called trace. The set of all states is convex: i.e.,
any combination of two states pρ + (1 − p)σ (for 0 ≤ p ≤ 1
and states ρ, σ) is also a state. A state ρ that does not have a
nontrivial decomposition is called a pure state. A pure state
is represented by a projection operator whose rank is 1, i.e.,
there exists a unit vector ψ (kψk = 1) satisfying Pφ = ψhψ|φi.
(P is also written |ψihψ|.) This correspondence allows one to
identify a unit vector with a pure state. A state that is not pure
is called mixed.
An observable which takes a value in a set Ω (assumed
to be discrete set in this paper) is described by a family of
positive operators {Aa }a∈Ω satisfying ∑a∈Ω Aa = 1. This
is called a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM). The

Suppose that E and F (and their negations E 0 = 1 − E
and F 0 = 1 − F) satisfy for a state ψ, hψ|Fψi >
