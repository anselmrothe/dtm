and maximize joint long-term reward (Kollock, 1998).
Empirical evidence confirms that facial displays of emotion
can impact cooperation (e.g., de Melo, Carnevale, & Gratch,
2012; Schug, Matsumoto, Horita, Yamagishi, & Bonnet,
2010). However, the mechanism by which such social
effects of emotion are achieved is less well understood.
In this paper we address this issue and look at appraisal
theories of emotion to understand what is the information
people retrieve from emotion displays and how is that
accomplished. In appraisal theories, emotion displays arise
from cognitive appraisal of events with respect to an agent’s
goals, desires and beliefs (e.g., is this event congruent with
my goals? Who is responsible for this event?). According to
the pattern of appraisals that occurs, different emotions are
experienced and displayed. Since displays reflect the agent’s
intentions through the appraisal process, it is also plausible
to ask whether people can infer from emotion displays the
agent’s goals by reversing the appraisal mechanism. We
refer to this proposal as reverse appraisal. The intuition is
that if appraisal, abstractly, is a function that maps from
<event, mental state> to emotion, reverse appraisal is a
function that maps from <event, emotion> to mental state.
Empirical evidence is still scarce but in a recent study Hareli
and Hess (2010) showed that people could, from expressed
emotion, make inferences about the character of the person
displaying emotion. For instance, a person who reacted with
anger to blame was perceived as being more aggressive,
self-confident but also as less warm and gentle than a person
who reacted with sadness. Moreover, the results showed that
such inferences were mediated by appraisal variables. In our
case, reverse appraisal predicts that people infer, from
emotion displays, how the counterpart is appraising the
social dilemma outcomes; then, from these perceptions of
appraisal, people infer how likely the counterpart is to
cooperate in the future, which we refer to as perceptions of
cooperativeness. This causal model is shown in Figure 1.
The goal of the paper is to establish this causal model.

Abstract
Two studies are presented that explore the interpersonal effect
of emotion displays in decision making in a social dilemma.
Experiment 1 (N=405) showed that facial displays of emotion
(joy, sadness, anger and guilt) had an effect on perception of
how the person was appraising the social dilemma outcomes
(perception of appraisals) and on perception of how likely the
person was to cooperate in the future (perception of
cooperation). Experiment 1 also showed that perception of
appraisals (partially and, in some cases, fully) mediated the
effect of emotion displays on perception of cooperation.
Experiment 2 (N=202) showed that manipulating perception
of appraisals, by expressing them textually, produced an
effect on perception of cooperation thus, providing evidence
for a causal model where emotion displays cause perception
of appraisals which, in turn, cause perception of cooperation.
In line with Hareli and Hess’ (2010) findings and a socialfunctions view of emotion, we advance the reverse appraisal
proposal that argues people can infer, from emotion displays,
how others are appraising a situation which, in turn, support
inferences that are relevant for decision making. We discuss
implications of these results and proposal to decision and
emotion theory.

Introduction
Recent decades have seen growing interest on the
interpersonal effect of emotion in decision making (e.g.,
Van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2010). Complementing
research on the impact of emotion in one’s own decision
making (for a recent review see Blanchette & Richards,
2010), this research explores how one’s emotion displays
impact another’s decision making and emphasizes that
emotional expressions are not simple manifestations of
internal experience; rather, expressions are other-directed
and communicate intentions, desired courses of actions,
expectations and behaviors (Frijda & Mesquita, 1994;
Keltner & Kring, 1998). The expression of emotion has also
been argued to play a significant role in emergence of
cooperation in social dilemmas (Boone & Buck, 2003;
Frank, 1988). Social dilemmas, such as the prisoner’s
dilemma, are situations where people must choose between
pursuing their own self-interest and collect a short-term
reward or trust another person to reach mutual cooperation

In a previous study (de Melo, Carnevale, & Gratch, 2011)
we began gathering evidence for this causal model.
Participants played the iterated prisoner’s dilemma with two
computer players, or agents, that, even though following the
same strategy to choose their actions, showed emotion
displays that reflected different social value orientations
(e.g., cooperative or competitive). Computer agents that
show emotion have been argued in the past to be a useful
research tool for basic human-human interaction research
(Blascovich et al., 2001). In our case, following the intuition
from appraisal theories that what matters is not the emotion
display in itself but the appraisals that elicited it, the agents
differed only in the context in which joy was expressed. For
instance, a cooperative agent showed a smile in mutual
cooperation, whereas a competitive agent showed a smile
when the agent exploited the participant. As predicted by
appraisal theories, the results showed that people interpreted
the same smile differently and cooperated more with the
cooperative than the competitive agent. In the present paper
we go further and study whether the information people
retrieve from emotion displays pertains to how the
counterpart is appraising the interaction and, if such
perceptions of appraisals lead to inferences about the
counterpart’s likelihood of cooperation. To accomplish this,
in a first experiment we asked participants to imagine
playing the prisoner’s dilemma with different agents;
participants were always told the same outcome occurred
but were shown videos of different emotional reactions from
the counterpart and were, then, queried about how they
thought the counterpart was appraising the situation and
how likely it was to cooperate in the future. We
hypothesized that: following previous findings, emotion
displays would impact perceptions of the counterpart’s
cooperativeness (H1); and, according to reverse appraisal,
emotion displays would impact perceptions of the
counterpart’s appraisals (H2). A statistical analysis of
mediation (Preacher & Hayes, 2008) was also conducted to
test whether appraisal variables (conduciveness to goals or
blameworthiness) mediated the effect of emotion displays
on people’s perception of the counterpart’s cooperativeness.
The hypothesis was that appraisal variables would mediate,
at least partially, the interpersonal effect of emotion (H3).
To further test the mediating role of appraisals, a second
experiment explicitly manipulated appraisals and measured
the effect on people’s perception of how cooperative the
counterpart was. The manipulation consisted of having the
agents, instead of showing facial displays of emotion,
express how they were appraising the outcome through text
(e.g., “I really don’t like this outcome and I blame you for
it”). The hypothesis was that, in line with reverse appraisal,
expression of appraisals would lead to effects on perception
of the counterpart’s cooperativeness that were consistent
with findings in the previous experiment (H4). This
experiment, thus, establishes the remaining link (ii, Figure
1) in the proposed causal model. Therefore, Experiments 1
and 2, together, provide experimental evidence for the
proposed model (Spencer, Zanna, & Fong, 2005).

Experiment 1
Method
Scenarios. Participants imagined playing the iterated prisoner’s
dilemma with agents that displayed emotion. Each scenario
pertained to the first round (of a 5-round game) and corresponded
to a particular outcome of the game. Participants were then shown
a video of the agent reacting emotionally to the outcome.
Following the approach by Kiesler, Waters and Sproull (1996), and
similarly to our previous study (de Melo et al., 2011) the game was
recast as an investment game.
Design. The experiment followed a mixed design with two factors:
Outcome (between-participants) with 4 levels (one for each
possible outcome of the game); and, Emotion (repeated-measures)
with 5 levels (Neutral vs. Joy vs. Anger vs. Sadness vs. Guilt).
Building on experience from previous studies, we only explored 4
emotions and did not consider, for the time being, a full factorial
design but, rather, only pairings of outcome and emotion that
produced effects in those studies, as shown in Table 1. Considering
only this subset of the possible pairings had, at least, two
advantages: (1) each participant experienced at most 3 pairings (as
opposed to 5 if all were considered), which constrained total
participation time and, thus, reduced fatigue and boredom effects;
(2) pairings that did not have a clear intuitive interpretation (e.g.,
displaying sadness or anger in mutual cooperation) were excluded
from analysis.

Emotion displays. In this experiment, participants watched videos
of agents expressing facial emotion displays. Three agents were
used–Ethan, William and David–and the respective facial displays
are shown in Figure 2. These facial displays were validated
elsewhere (de Melo et al., 2012). The agents were referred to by
their names throughout. Each participant saw a different agent in
each condition, and they were randomly assigned to conditions.

Measures. After watching the video of the agent’s emotional
reaction, we asked participants the following questions (the
questions referred to the agents by their respective names): How
much did the agent experience each of the following emotions: a)
Joy b) Sadness c) Anger d) Guilt? (scale goes from 1, not at all, to
7, very much).
Even though several appraisal theories have been proposed
(Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003), there tends to be agreement on which
appraisals predict the emotions we consider in this experiment: joy
occurs when the event is conducive to one’s goals; sadness occurs
when the event is not conducive to one’s goals; anger occurs when
the event is not conducive to one’s goals and is caused by another
agent; guilt occurs when the event is not conducive to one’s goals
and is caused by the self. Thus, two appraisal variables are of
relevance here: (a) conduciveness to goals, which measures
whether the event is consistent or inconsistent with the individual’s
goals; and, (b) blameworthiness, which measures whether the self
or another agent is responsible for the event. After watching the
video of the agent’s emotional reaction, participants were asked the
following questions about how was the agent appraising the
outcome (Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003):
1. How pleasant for him was it to be in this situation?
2. At the time of experiencing the emotion, do you think he
perceived that the consequences of the event did or would
bring about positive, desirable consequences for him (e.g.,
helping him reach a goal, or giving pleasure)?
3. Was the situation obstructive or conducive to his goals?
4. Was what happened something that he regarded as fair?
5. How much did you think he blamed himself for the event?
6. How much did you think he blamed you for the event?
Following the appraisal perception questions, we asked the
participant one question about perception of the agent’s
cooperativeness (scale goes from 1, not at all, to 7, very much):
How likely is he to cooperate in the next round? (where
“cooperate” was replaced by the respective action in the
investment game).

Effects on perception of appraisals. Questions 1 to 4 were
highly correlated (α = .850) and, thus, were collapsed
(averaged) into a single measure called conduciveness to
goals. For each outcome, we conducted a repeated-measures
ANOVA to analyze the effect of emotion display on
conduciveness to goals, self-blameworthiness (question 5)
and participant-blameworthiness (question 6). Means,
standard deviations, significance levels and effect sizes are
reported in Table 3.

Mediation analysis. In this subsection we present a causal
steps approach multiple mediation analysis (Preacher &
Hayes, 2008) of perceptions of appraisal on the effect of
emotion displays on perception of cooperativeness. This
method is an extension to multiple mediators of the singlemediation analysis proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986).
Figure 3 summarizes the mediation model. The independent
variables (IVs) were the classification questions for
perception of joy, anger, sadness and guilt. The dependent
variable (DV) was perception of cooperativeness. The
proposed mediators were the perception of appraisal
variables: conduciveness to goals, self-blame and
participant-blame. According to this approach, there is

the IV to the mediator is significant; (2) the path, bx, from
the mediator to the DV, when controlling for the IV, is
significant; (3) the indirect effect, axbx, from the IV to the

there is full mediation when the direct effect, c’, of the IV

agents to be less likely to cooperate than the neutral agent;
finally, when the agent exploited, participants perceived the
guilty agent to be more likely to cooperate than the neutral
agent which, in turn, was more likely to cooperate than the
happy agent. Notice these effects are compatible with
findings in the literature (e.g., Van Kleef et al., 2010).
Hypothesis H1 was, thus, confirmed. The results in Table 3
show that emotion displays impacted perception of
appraisals in a way that was consistent with appraisal
theories (Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003). For instance, happy
agents were perceived to find the outcome conducive to
their goals; sad or guilty agents were perceived to blame
themselves for the (negative) outcome; and, angry agents
were perceived to blame the participant for the (negative)
outcome. Therefore, hypothesis H2 was also confirmed.
Finally, the results in Table 4, show that appraisal variables,
partially and sometimes fully, mediated the effect of
emotion displays on perception of cooperativeness. For
instance, in mutual cooperation, conduciveness to goals
partially mediated the effect of joy; and, when the agent
exploited, conduciveness to goals and self-blame fully
mediated the effect of joy and partially mediated the effect
of guilt. Hypothesis H3 was, thus, confirmed.

Experiment 2
Spencer et al. (2005) argue that showing mediation
statistically, as proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986), is no
substitute to showing mediation experimentally. As an
alternative to the statistical approach, they propose the
experimental-causal-chain design, where each link of the
proposed causal model is shown experimentally. Applying
the experimental-causal-chain approach to our case means
showing, experimentally, each of the causal links in the
proposed causal model (Figure 1). The effect of emotion
displays on perception of appraisals (causal link i) was
already shown, experimentally, in the previous experiment.

Figure 3: The multiple mediation model.

Discussion
The results in Table 2 show that emotion displays impacted
perception of the counterpart’s cooperativeness: in mutual
cooperation, participants perceived the happy agent to be
more likely to cooperate than a neutral agent; when the
participant exploited, participants perceived the angry or sad

guilty agent to be more likely to cooperate than the neutral
agent which, in turn, was more likely to cooperate than the
happy agent. Notice these are the same patterns as in
Experiment 1 and, thus, our hypothesis H4 was confirmed.
Finally, notice the Sample x Emotion interaction was not
significant for any of the outcomes.

Method
Experiment 2 used the same design and scenarios as Experiment 1.
However, the manipulation consisted, instead of emotion displays,
of textual expression of the appraisals. The mapping of emotion to
appraisals followed predictions from appraisal theories (Ellsworth
& Scherer, 2003) and is shown in Table 5. Participants were still
introduced to the agents they imagined playing with, however,
only a static image was shown of the (neutral) face. The textual
expression of appraisals was simulated by typing at the bottom of
the screen, as if simulating a chat interface.

General Discussion
This paper presents insight into the mechanism for the social
effects of emotion in a social dilemma. Two experiments
were described that suggest a causal model (Figure 1) where
emotion displays lead the receiver to infer how the sender is
appraising the ongoing interaction and, these perceptions of
appraisal, in turn, lead to inferences about the sender’s
propensity for cooperation in the dilemma. The experiments
support this model by establishing experimentally both links
in the model (Spencer et al., 2005) and by providing
statistical evidence that perceptions of appraisal mediate the
effect of emotion displays on perceptions of cooperativeness
(Preacher & Hayes, 2008). We refer to the mechanism
suggested by this causal model as reverse appraisal.

Results
For each outcome, we conducted a repeated-measures
ANOVA to analyze the effect of emotion display on
perception of cooperativeness. The means, standard
deviations, significance levels and effect sizes are shown in
Table 6. If we collapse the data from the two experiments, it
becomes possible to analyze whether there was any
interaction between Sample (Experiment 1 vs. Experiment
2) and Emotion (Neutral vs. Joy vs. Anger vs. Sadness vs.
Guilt). Because the argument is that appraisals are part of
the information retrieved from emotion displays, we
expected there to be no interactions. Table 6 also shows
these interactions.

Implications for emotion theory. The results presented in
the paper provide further evidence that emotions serve
important social functions (Frijda & Mesquita, 1994;
Keltner & Kring, 1998). For instance, whereas anger
signaled a willingness to punish a non-cooperator with noncooperation, guilt signaled regret for one’s non-cooperation
and a willingness to cooperate in the future. The paper
further proposes that reverse appraisal is a useful framework
for the social functions of emotion. Reverse appraisal
suggests that an important component of the information
retrieved from emotion displays refers to how the
counterpart is appraising the ongoing interaction. This
information is then used to infer the counterpart’s mental
states, such as his or her propensity for cooperation in a
social dilemma. Finally, reverse appraisal can potentially
generalize beyond social dilemmas and be viewed as a
general mechanism for interpretation of emotion displays.
This is, in fact, a promising line of future inquiry.

Discussion
The results in Table 6 show that expression of appraisals
impacted perceptions of cooperativeness: in mutual
cooperation, participants perceived the happy agent to be
more likely to cooperate than a neutral agent; when the
participant exploited, participants perceived the angry or sad
agents to be less likely to cooperate than the neutral agent;
finally, when the agent exploited, participants perceived the

making through affective processes (e.g., emotional
contagion) or inferential processes. Regarding the latter,
Van Kleef et al. suggest that “each discrete emotion has its
own antecedents, appraisal components, relational themes,
and action tendencies” (p.48) and, thus, “observing a
particular emotion in another person provides relatively
differentiated information about how that person regards the
situation” (p.53). This paper provides empirical evidence for
such “differentiated information” in emotion displays
which, as suggested by the results, pertains to perceptions of
appraisal. Our results also reinforce findings regarding the
importance of context for the interpretation of emotion (de
Melo et al., 2011; Hareli & Hess, 2010; Van Kleef et al.,
2010). For instance, the results showed that people reacted
differently to the same smile when it was shown after
mutual cooperation or after the agent exploited them.
Finally, the results support Schug et al.’s (2010) contention
that people are capable of identifying non-cooperators from
emotion displays and punish accordingly.

Limitations and future work. Since the results from our
experiments were promising, we plan in the near future to
repeat both experiments with the complete factorial design.
Such design will clarify the effect of emotion in pairings
that were left unexplored (e.g., expression of anger in
mutual cooperation). Moreover, complementing this paper’s
focus of comparing the effect of emotion within the same
outcome, the factorial design will allow us to study the
effect of emotion across outcomes. Another limitation we
intend do address is that the current causal model does not
predict what will people decide after making inferences
about the counterpart’s likelihood of cooperation. Notice the
link between perceptions of cooperation and the decision to
cooperate is not simple. For instance, whereas a pro-social
might cooperate, a pro-self might exploit the cooperator
(Steinel & de Dreu, 2004). Finally, to understand how
reverse appraisal generalizes beyond the prisoner’s
dilemma, it is important to assess whether perceptions of
appraisal also mediate the effects of emotion displays in
more social decision making tasks such as other social
dilemmas (e.g., public goods), trust games and negotiation.
