Abstract

Phonology is held to play a central role in typical reading
development (Shankweiler et al., 1979) and sensory or
phonological deficits are often held to be a primary cause of
reading disability (Snowling, 2008). However, little is known
about the nature of phonology at the endpoint of atypical
reading development -- that is, in adult poor readers. We
examined the time course of (auditory) lexical activation,
competition, and learning in a community sample with a high
proportion of poor readers in two experiments. In Experiment
1, contrary to our expectations, we found that poor readers
were more sensitive to subphonemic coarticulatory cues than
better readers. In Experiment 2, we examined the time course
of word learning along with the time course of phonological
competition. Poor readers differed from better readers in the
trajectory of learning, and also in phonological competition:
typical readers exhibited strong competition between rhymes,
but poor readers did not. Simulations with a computational
model suggest that instability in phonological organization
(simulated via reduced lateral inhibition) can explain
differences in both studies in counter-intuitive ways, shedding
new light on an old problem.

Introduction
A fundamental principle shared by nearly all theories of
reading is that phonology plays a key role mediating the
mapping from print to meaning (Harm & Seidenberg, 2004;
Shankweiler et al., 1979; Snowling & Hulme, 2005; Ziegler
& Goswami, 2005). This follows from repeated findings
that impairments in reading are correlated with deficits in
phonological abilities (Shankweiler et al., 1977; Snowling,
1981). While multiple hypotheses exist, linking the deficit
to poor phonological quality (Joanisse, 1994) or low-level
sensory impairments (e.g., Tallal, 1980), the precise nature
of the phonological deficit in dyslexia and its causes
remains a subject of intense debate.
Fairly little is known about the nature of phonological
processing at the endpoint of atypical reading development,
since studies of reading disability logically focus on
developing samples. An exception is recent work by
Szenkovits, Ramus, and colleagues (reviewed by Ramus &
Szenkovits, 2008). They point out that deficits in
phonological abilities in college-aged poor readers (self-

reported "presumed dyslexics") are most readily detected in
tasks with significant working memory demands (phonemic
awareness tasks, or verbal short-term memory tasks) or
under time pressure (as in rapid auditory naming). However,
in tasks that do not impose such demands, poor readers are
not strikingly different from typical readers (most notably,
they report that poor readers in their sample exhibit
phonological similarity effects similar to those exhibited by
good readers, contra Shankweiler et al., 1977, who reported
that poor readers fail to show such effects). Ramus and
Sjenkovits suggest that the phonological deficit in dyslexia
therefore may not be one of phonological representation, but
rather one of phonological access -- and so manifests as
difficulty in rapidly retrieving phonological forms into
working memory. This new take on phonology in dyslexia
has the potential to illuminate the nature and basis of the
phonological deficit in new ways.
Techniques for examining the time course of on-line
language processing provide the means to examine this
hypothesis more closely. We report preliminary results of a
project investigating the phonological abilities of adult poor
readers. We use stimulus manipulations and time course
measures that have been used to investigate lexical
activation and competition at a fine timescale (Dahan,
Magnuson, Tanenhaus, & Hogan, 2001) and lexical learning
(Magnuson, Tanenhaus, Aslin, & Dahan, 2003) in typical
adults.

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we sought a sensitive test of the finegrained phonological processing of our sample, but in a task
that minimizes cognitive demands. The study reported by
Dahan, Magnuson, Tanenhaus and Hogan (2001) fits the
bill. Dahan et al. investigated the impact of misleading
coarticulation (subcategorical -- i.e., subphonemic -mismatches). They achieved misleading coarticulation by
cross-splicing recordings of words. For example, they took
the initial consonant and vowel (CV) from "neck", cut as
late as possible before the final stop consonant, and spliced
it together with the final consonant of "net". This sounds
like "net", but the vowel includes coarticulation consistent
with /k/. They labeled this sort of item "W2W1" (word 2
spliced to word 1). They also had cases where the initial CV

1429

came from a nonword ("nep" + "net"  N3W1). Finally,
they included cross-spliced items without misleading
coarticulation by splicing together two recordings of a target
word like "net" (W1W1).
Dahan et al. presented these items with displays like the
one shown in Figure 1, using the Visual World Paradigm
(VWP; Tanenhaus et al., 1995). Subjects heard instructions
like "point to the net". Eye movements were recorded as
subjects followed the spoken instructions.
The motivation for their study was the apparent
deficiency in the TRACE model (McClelland & Elman,
1986) identified by Marslen-Wilson and Warren (1994)
using these kinds of materials, in that lexical decision
reaction times appeared inconsistent with the time course of
activation in TRACE. However, the time course measure
provided by the VWP (Figure 1, right) showed that the
TRACE predictions (Figure 1, center) were remarkably
accurate. Crucially, subjects fixated the competitor, "neck,"
most when there was misleading coarticulation consistent
with that word (W2W1 condition), and least when the
coarticulation was fully consistent with the target (W1W1).
Fixation proportions were intermediate when misleading
coarticulation did not map onto a word (N3W1). TRACE
predicts the W1W1 and W2W1 patterns intuitively; the
word with best bottom-up match is initially activated most
strongly. The N3W1 results follow because neither net nor
neck has an advantage as the nonword coarticulation is
heard; thus, both reach a relatively high level of activation
before the disambiguating final consonant.
Predictions What might we predict for our sample? If their
linguistic difficulties arise from imprecise phonological
representations (e.g., the phonological quality hypothesis of
Joanisse, 2004)
or
slow-to-activate
phonological
representations (e.g., the generalized slowing hypothesis;
Kail, 1994), we might expect them to be less affected by
misleading coarticulation, and so show weaker competition
effects. On the phonological access hypothesis (Ramus &
Szenkovits, 2008), if the task minimizes cognitive demands,
our sample ought to look no different from a typical sample.

Methods
Participants The participants were 56 college-aged adults
(mean age = 21) recruited from community colleges and

GED programs in the New Haven area. Previously, we have
documented linguistic and other cognitive abilities in
samples from this population (Braze et al., 2007), and
demonstrated that the degree to which reading is subserved
by common, supramodal brain areas also subserving speech
is correlated with reading ability (Shankweiler et al., 2008).
We examine this sample with a battery of 25 linguistic and
other cognitive assessments. In this brief report, we only
have room to mention that this population tends to lag in
language and other cognitive domains, but a wide range of
abilities is observed. Our goal is to conduct individual
differences analyses. Given space constraints for the current
report, though, we will compare the top 50% of readers in
our sample with the bottom 50%. The most intuitive
measure for conducting this median split is the standardized
score from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (which
correlates closely with, e.g., a composite score derived from
all subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson battery). The bottom
50% had standard scores ranging from 67 to 90, with a
mean of 81. The top 50% had scores ranging from 91 to
137, with a mean of 104. The results we report do not differ
if we remove, e.g., participants with low approximated IQ,
and so the full sample is included.
Materials The auditory materials were those used by Dahan
et al. (2001), and consisted of 15 word 1-word 2-nonword 3
triples (W1, W2, N3), such as net, neck, and nep (for the full
set, see the Appendix B of Dahan et al.). The visual
materials were similar to those used by Dahan et al., except
that their line drawings were replaced with photographs.
Procedure The procedure was identical Dahan et al.'s.
There were 3 lists, with 5 items assigned to each condition
(W1W1 [consistent coarticulation], W2W1 [misleading
cohort coarticulation], N3W1 [misleading nonword
coarticulation]) in each list. Participants were randomly
assigned to lists. On each trial, a fixation cross and four
simple shapes appeared on the screen. When the participant
clicked the cross, the trial began, and pictures of four
objects appeared. A spoken instruction was presented over
speakers, such as "point to the net; now click on it and put it
below the circle." We tracked eye movements using an SRResearch Eyelink II head-mounted eye tracker, sampling at
250 hz. We tracked the probability of fixating each item

over time from the onset of the target word (e.g., net).

Results and discussion
Eye movements were parsed into saccades and fixations.
Saccade time was attributed to the following fixation, since
saccades are essentially ballistic; the initiation of a saccade
is the earliest indicator of the choice to fixate the next gaze
position. Eye tracking results are presented Figure 2.
Qualitatively, the observed patterns for both halves of our
sample resemble the (competitor) pattern in Figure 1.
Notably, there is no apparent delay in the response to the
bottom up signal in either half, when compared with the
university sample in Figure 1. There are some differences
between the two subsets in Figure 2 in the relative
magnitude and timing of competitor proportion curves, but
the most salient difference between the groups is in the
target fixations in the mismatch conditions. The top 50%
show the same ordering observed by Dahan et al.: W1W1 >
N3W1 > W2W1. However, the pattern for the bottom 50%
is W1W1 > W2W1 > N3W1. We explored this using a 2
(subset) x 2 (W2W1, N3W1) ANOVA on mean target
fixation proportion in the window from 200 msecs after
word onset (the expected average latency for a signal-driven
saccade) to 1200 msecs (approximate target peak latency).
There was a main effect of Subset (top=0.40,
bottom=0.32; F(1,54)=6.8, p=.01), but not Condition (F <
1), and a significant interaction (F(1,54)=4.2, p<0.05). This
was due to a reliable effect of condition for the top subset
(W2W1=.37, N3W1=.44; F(1,54)=5.4, p=.03), but not for
the bottom (W2W1=.34, N3W1=.30; F<1).
Thus, there are several interesting patterns. There is no
apparent delay in bottom up response. However, the later
time course is different in both subsets compared to the
sample of Dahan et al. (2001), and the subsets differ from
each other. Most notably, it appears that lexical competition
differs in the bottom subset. Target proportions for the
mismatch conditions are depressed throughout the analysis
window in comparison to the top subset, and the two

mismatch conditions do not differ reliably in the amount of
target interference they cause for the bottom subset.
Computational modeling To make sense of these patterns,
we turned to the jTRACE re-implementation (Strauss,
Harris, & Magnuson, 2007) of the TRACE model
(McClelland & Elman, 1986) that includes several
additional features (graphical user interface, plotting and
scripting utilities). Starting with the default parameters used
by Dahan et al. (2001) to obtain the simulations shown in
the middle panel of Figure 1, we explored a wide range of
changes to several parameters, one at a time. The goal was
to determine whether any parameter could be changed to
produce the observed changes in the bottom subset:
increased competition effects without slowing initial lexical
access. We tested a variety of parameters in TRACE
(feedforward and feedback gain at various points, addition
of input and "sensory" [model-internal] noise). Lexical
decay was of particular interest, as the parameter McMurray
et al. (2010) claim best fits individual differences in a
lexical competition in a group of adolescents with a range of
language and cognitive abilities; however, its influence is
too weak and late. Two parameters could simulate the
general trends: reducing phonemic or lexical lateral
inhibition by approximately 50% from default levels.
Reducing inhibition does not affect initial activation rates,
but it allows larger competition effects because it delays the
impact of late-arriving bottom-up disambiguation. In
particular, it predicts larger cohort competition effects (note
slight trends in this direction in the bottom subset) as well as
less differentiation in target trajectories for the mismatch
conditions.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we continued our exploration of our
sample's phonological abilities by examining lexical
competition in the context of an artificial lexicon learning
task (based on Magnuson, Tanenhaus, Aslin, & Dahan,
2003). This allowed us to simultaneously study

1431

Figure 3: pictures of unusual animals used in the artificial
lexicon study (Experiment 2).
phonological competition effects in word recognition (how
strongly do "cohorts", like /pibo/ and /pibu/, compete? How
strongly do rhymes, like /pibo/ and /dibo/, compete?) and
word learning ability. Magnuson et al. (2003) were
motivated in part by the goal of precisely controlling lexical
characteristics such as phonological similarity, frequency,
and neighborhood density. This approach has an added
advantage for our sample. To the degree that our sample
diverges from the performance of typical participants using
real words, it is very difficult to determine the locus of the
difference. There may be deep reasons, such as differential
organization of processing mechanisms, or shallow ones,
like simple differences in vocabulary size. An artificial
lexicon paradigm allows us to put participants on maximally
similar footing. While participants differ in linguistic and
cognitive abilities, the items are equally unfamiliar to all.
Predictions Virtually any variant of the phonological deficit
hypothesis might predict poor readers would perform worse
in learning the artifical lexicon. With respect to the time
course of cohort and rhyme competition, two precedents
using familiar words in the visual world eye tracking
paradigm suggest possible outcomes. Desroches, Joanisse,
and Robertson (2006) examined cohort and rhyme
competition in children with dyslexia. Unlike typically
developing peers, they did not exhibit rhyme competition
effects. In contrast, McMurray et al. (2010) reported that
adolescents meeting criteria for SLI showed stronger cohort
and rhyme effects, though only in the late time course.
Thus, we might expect to see typical cohort effects but weak
or absent rhyme effects (consistent with Desroches et al.) or
late-enhanced cohort and rhyme effects (consistent with
McMurray et al.).

Methods
Participants A subset of participants from Experiment 1
participated in Experiment 2: 14 individuals from the top
50% and 20 from the bottom 50%.
Materials 8 artificial words were constructed with one
"cohort" (onset) competitor in the artificial lexicon and one
rhyme. The words were /pibo, pibu, dibo, dibu, tupa, tupi,
bupa, bupi/. The visual materials were pictures of 8 unusual
animals (see Figure 3). Names were mapped randomly to
pictures for each subject.
Procedure Each trial had identical structure. A fixation
cross appeared in the center of the screen. When the
participant clicked the cross, the trial began. Two pictures

appeared, to the left and right of the cross. 500 ms later, an
instruction was played, such as "find the pibo." At first,
participants could only guess. If they clicked on the
incorrect object, they heard "try again." When they clicked
the correct object, they heard feedback, such as "that's right,
that's the pibo!" The experiment consisted of 8 blocks of 24
trials. Each item appeared as the target 3 times per block,
once each with its cohort, its rhyme, and an unrelated item.
Thus, each block had 8 cohort, rhyme, and unrelated trials.
There was no formal test; we measured behavior
continuously over learning.

Results and discussion
Accuracy and response time Accuracy and response time
(for accurate trials) are shown in Figure 4 for the two
groups. We conducted ANOVAs with factors Type (Cohort,
Rhyme, Unrelated) and Block for accuracy and RT. In the
interest of space, we will only briefly summarize the results.
The two subsets were both reliably more accurate for
Unrelated than Rhyme trials, and more accurate in Rhyme
than Cohort trials. In RT, the main effect of Type was not
reliable for the top subset; in planned comparisons, none of
the Types differed another. But for the bottom subset,
Cohort trials were significantly slower than both Rhyme and
Unrelated trials, which did not differ from each other. Thus,
the bottom subset seemed to show less rhyme interference.
Fixation proportions over time are presented in Figure 5
by just showing target fixations (competitor fixations are
essentially complementary) averaged over all correct trials
(as the patterns did not change substantially with training).
For qualitative comparison, results from a sample of 14 U.
of CT (UConn) undergraduates are presented. Qualitatively,
there is a very striking result. There are clear effects of both
Cohort and Rhyme for the UConn sample. The Cohort
effect is stronger and earlier, as with real words (Allopenna,
Magnuson, & Tanenhaus, 1998; Desroches et al., 2006),
while the Rhyme effect emerges later. Growth curve
analysis (Mirman, Dixon, & Magnuson, 2008) revealed
reliable intercept differences for the TD group (Unrelated >
Rhyme > Cohort), analogous to differences in mean
proportion over the analysis window. In contrast, the two
community sample groups shows strong Cohort effects, but
delayed Rhyme effects. The Rhyme condition differs
reliably from the Unrelated condition for the top 50%, but
not for the bottom 50%.
Our results are consistent with those of Desroches et al.
(2006), who reported an absence of rhyme effects in
children with dyslexia using a similar eye tracking paradigm
with familiar, real words. They are partially consistent with
the recent report of McMurray et al. (2010) that adolescents
with SLI show larger but later competition effects than
typically developing peers. We again turned to the model in
order to explore possible bases for such a pattern.
Computational modeling As with Experiment 1, we used
the jTRACE re-implementation (Strauss et al., 2007) of
TRACE. Because TRACE is not a learning model (though

Adult poor readers continue to differ from good readers in
phonological processing. Our poor readers showed greater
interference effects from misleading coarticulation than
better-reading peers in Experiment 1. Poor readers learned
new words with a different trajectory than better readers in
Experiment 2, and exhibited late, weak rhyme competition
effects. The two primary patterns of differences -- enhanced
competition due to misleading coarticulation and absence of
rhyme effects -- can both be modeled in TRACE via
reduced lateral inhibition at the phoneme level. The
convergence on phoneme inhibition in the simulations of
Experiments 1 and 2 increases our confidence that this
parameter manipulation is capturing something important
about phonological differences in poor readers. One next
step will be to use the re-parameterized model to generate
predictions for poor readers in new tasks.

Mirman, McClelland & Holt, 2006), we treated TRACE as a
model of the stabilized system at the end of learning. Again,
we changed one parameter at a time, looking for a change
that would leave the magnitude and timing of the cohort
effect intact while ideally wiping out the rhyme effect. We
again tried several parameters. Lexical decay does not
selectively affect rhyme effects. Reduced lexical lateral
inhibition actually boosts rhyme effects. Only one parameter
could generate the correct trends: a reduction in lateral
inhibition at the phoneme layer. As it is reduced, rhyme
effects are weakened and delayed, while leaving the cohort
time course largely intact (though cohort effects are
somewhat amplified). This counter-intuitive outcome
follows from what happens to phonemes other than the
initial phoneme of the target word. With inhibition reduced,
similar phonemes get much more activated. Even though the
phoneme inhibition parameter is lower, there is actually
greater inhibitory flow at the phoneme level, putting rhymes
that differ from the target in initial phoneme by more than a
single feature at a disadvantage. Interestingly, lateral
inhibition at the phoneme level was one of two parameters
that could achieve the correct pattern to fit the bottom 50%
subset behavior in Experiment 1.
Summary In Experiment 2, good and poor readers achieved
similar accuracy in artificial lexicon learning. However, the
time course of learning was substantially different, with
poor readers exhibiting slower learning in early trials. Poor
readers showed similar on-line onset (cohort) competition
effects as better readers, but failed to exhibit a reliable effect
of rhyme competition (instead showing a weak, delayed
effect). This converges with a report that children with
dyslexia did not exhibit rhyme effects in a similar study
using real words (Desroches et al., 2006). In TRACE
simulations, the only way to substantially reduce rhyme
effects without inappropriately perturbing cohort (onset)
effects was to reduce lateral inhibition at the phoneme level
-- a parameter change that can also capture the poor reader
differences in Experiment 1.

discrete representations of phonemes in the brain, let alone a
discrete parameter controlling lateral inhibition. The ability
of TRACE to simulate differences based on reduced
phoneme inhibition instead points to the level of
phonological organization in the dynamical system it is
meant to simulate, i.e., the mechanisms underlying human
word recognition. Thus, our simulations may identify the
level of the system -- phonological organization -- that
appears to be crucially different in poor readers.
Our results are potentially consistent with any form of
the phonological deficit hypothesis, although they
somewhat favor accounts that assume a typical level of
phonetic resolution (given that poor and better readers
showed similar timing in early lexical activation), and
differences in the stability of phonological representations.
In particular, our results may be compatible with the
phonological access hypothesis (Ramus & Sjenkovits,
2008). However, our results also suggest differences in
phonological access may be more subtle than suggested by
Ramus and Sjenkovits, who emphasize working memory
demands in conventional tasks that most clearly identify
phonological deficits. That we observed differences in the
time course of lexical activation, competition and learning
in poor adult readers in minimally demanding, naturalistic
tasks suggests that the locus of the phonological deficit may
be a more low-level property of the system, even though this
deficit may require difficult tasks or sensitive measures to
be detected. We hope that our continuing exploration of
individual differences in adult poor readers will illuminate
this possibility further.
