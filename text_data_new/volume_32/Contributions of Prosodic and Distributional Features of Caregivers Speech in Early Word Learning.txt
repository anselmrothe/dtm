Abstract
How do characteristics of caregiver speech contribute to a
child’s early word learning? We explore the relationship between a single child’s vocabulary growth and the distributional
and prosodic characteristics of the speech he hears using data
collected for the Human Speechome Project, an ecologically
valid corpus collected from the home of a family with a young
child. We measured F0, intensity, phoneme duration, usage
frequency, recurrence, and MLU for caregivers’ production of
each word that the child learned during the period of recording. When all variables are considered, we obtain a model of
word acquisition as a function of caregiver input speech. Coefficient estimates in the model help to illuminate which factors
are relevant to learning classes of words. In addition, words
that deviate from the model’s prediction are of interest as they
may suggest important social, contextual and other cues relevant to word learning.

Introduction
How does the linguistic environment contribute to children’s
early word learning? We address this question by making
an in-depth study of a single child’s vocabulary growth and
the relationship of this growth to prosodic and distributional
features of the naturally occurring caregiver speech that the
child is exposed to. Studying this relationship has the potential to illuminate not only the role of environmental factors in
word learning, but also the child’s underlying learning mechanisms.
Children’s linguistic environments plays a crucial role in
determining what they learn, but the precise relationship between what children hear (their input) and what they learn
is still unknown. Much of the debate about the role of the
linguistic environment has centered around whether the particular properties of child-directed speech (CDS) are useful
for the acquisition of syntax. On the one hand, Snow (1986)
emphasized the importance of CDS for conveying communicative intent and its consequent importance to development. However, the work of Newport, Gleitman, and Gleitman (1977) challenged the assumption that CDS is a simplified teaching language that facilitates the acquisition of specific syntactic constructions. More recent work has focused
on broader patterns of development, documenting a correlation between grammatical and lexical developmental trajectories (Bates & Goodman, 1999).
Stronger evidence for the contributions of CDS to language
development have been found in the realm of lexical acquisition. For example, Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer, and

Lyons (1991) found a positive correlation between the quantity of CDS and a child’s vocabulary size and rate of growth.
Increased frequency of use of particular words in CDS has
also been tied to earlier acquisition of those words by the
child (Huttenlocher et al., 1991; Goodman, Dale, & Li, 2008;
Roy, Frank, & Roy, 2009). Frequency is not the only factor
that affects acquisition, however. The production of a word in
isolation is also a consistent predictor of lexical development
(Brent & Siskind, 2001). Finally, prosodic factors in caregiver speech also likely play a role in acquisition: Echols and
Newport (1992) found that children were much more likely
to produce and recognize syllables that were stressed in caregivers’ speech.
While previous studies of the relationship between CDS
and children’s vocabulary acquisition have largely focused on
examining a small section of the input to a range of children,
here we take a different approach. We make a very detailed
study of this relationship in a very large, dense, longitudinal
dataset collected in an ecologically valid setting. This dataset
was collected as part of the Human Speechome Project (Roy
et al., 2006). At present, the Speechome Corpus consists of
time aligned orthographic transcripts as well as a complete
audio and video record of all data collected. Therefore, our
analysis is not limited to factors like frequency (which can be
computed from transcripts alone): instead we are able to include additional prosodic variables that can only be computed
from aligned audio and transcripts.
Our goal in this current analysis is to predict the child’s age
of acquisition (AoA) for individual words on the basis of information from CDS. AoA is usually categorized as the age
of receptive and productive acquisition. Receptive acquisition is typically determined by the caregiver via diary studies
or checklists, and is consequently relatively difficult to assess
with high accuracy for a large sample of words. Age of productive acquisition is more easily measured from transcripts,
although there are complications here as well, since early productive word forms often differ from the corresponding adult
word form. However, we are able to overcome this limitation
to a greater extent than previous studies, because of the density of our data and the accessibility of caregivers for help in
the transcription process.
The plan of our paper is as follows. We begin with an
overview of the Human Speechome Project. We then review
the regression framework we used for the prediction of vocabulary acquisition and describe in detail the predictors we included in this framework. We report both simple correlations

between individual predictors and age of word acquisition as
well as the results of a series of regression models. We end by
considering the implications of our work for future research
in language acquisition.

The Human Speechome Project
The Human Speechome Project (HSP) (Roy et al., 2006)
was launched in 2005 to study early language development
through analysis of audio and video recordings of the first
two to three years of one child’s life. The house of one author’s (DR) family was outfitted with fourteen microphones
and eleven omnidirectional cameras at the time of birth of
their first child. Audio was recorded from ceiling mounted
boundary layer microphones at 16 bit resolution with a sampling rate of 48 KHz. Due to the unique acoustic properties
of boundary layer microphones, most speech throughout the
house including very quiet speech was captured with sufficient clarity to enable reliable transcription. Video was also
recorded to capture non-linguistic context using high resolution fisheye lens video cameras that provide a bird’s-eye view
of people, objects, and activity throughout the home.
The Speechome project captures one child’s development
in tremendous depth. While this aspect of the project limits
conclusions about general aspects of language development,
the dense sampling strategy affords many advantages over
other corpora (eg. (Lieven, Salomo, & Tomasello, 2009)).
First, the Speechome corpus is higher in density than other
reported corpus, capturing an estimated 70% of the child’s
wakeful experiences during the recording period. Second,
since data were collected without specific theoretical assumptions or hypotheses, they can be reanalyzed in multiple ways
from different theoretical perspectives. Finally, since high
resolution video was also collected the role of non-linguistic
context can also be studied (though in the current study we
restrict our analysis to aspects of speech input).
The current study builds on our first analysis of the Speechome data (Roy et al., 2009). In that study, we focused on
the child’s 9-24 month age range and explored several aspects
of word learning, examining variables such as the child’s vocabulary growth, increase in mean length of utterance (MLU)
as well as properties of caregiver speech such as caregiver
MLU over time. Due to the high density of data, with several days per week fully transcribed over the course of this
9–24 month period, a surprising picture emerged of the tuned
relationship between the child’s development and caregiver
speech. Congruent with other reports, we found that words
used more frequently in caregiver speech tend to be learned
earlier by the child, with a much stronger effect when words
are grouped by class (Huttenlocher et al., 1991; Goodman et
al., 2008).

Methods

video. Most analysis depends on annotated data, however, so
an effective annotation methodology is critical to the project’s
success. We have developed a semi-automated speech transcription system called BlitzScribe that facilitates fast and
accurate speech transcription (Roy & Roy, 2009). Automatic speech detection and segmentation algorithms identify
speech segments, presenting them to a human transcriber in
a simple user interface. This focuses human effort on the
speech and leads to a smoother transcription process. We
have obtained an approximately five-fold performance gain
at comparable accuracy to other tools.
Speaker identification algorithms are then applied to the
transcribed audio segments, selecting from one of the four
primary speakers (mother, father, nanny, and child) and producing a classification confidence score. Speaker annotation
tools allow a human to review low confidence segments and
make corrections as necessary. Since identifying CDS currently requires significant human effort, we operationalized
the definition to refer to caregiver speech when the child is
awake and close enough to hear. We refer to this as “child
available speech” (CAS).
Our current study focuses on the child’s 9–24 month age
range, and the corresponding subset of the corpus contains
4260 hours of 14-track audio, of which and estimated 1150
hours contain speech. Of the 488 days in this time range,
recordings were made 444 of the days with a mean of 9.6
hours recorded per day. The current results are based on 72
fully transcribed days containing an average of 23,055 words
per day of combined CAS and child speech, totaling 1.66 million words. We estimate that the fully transcribed 9-24 month
corpus will contain 12 million words. Our long term goal is
to fully annotate all speech in the corpus with transcriptions,
speaker identity, and prosodic features.
Three limitations of the speech annotation process required
us to filter the 1.66 million words of transcripts and only use
a subset of the transcripts for the current analyses. First,
roughly 700,000 words belong to utterances marked by human transcribers as containing more than one speaker. In
other words, about 40% of pause separated spoken utterances
contain abutting or overlapping speech of two or more people, reflecting the realities of “speech in the wild.” Since
our objective here is to examine interaction of CAS and child
speech, and since we cannot currently distinguish the sources
of this type of speech, we removed these utterances. Second, to reduce errors due to automatic speaker identification,
we sorted utterances based on a confidence metric produced
by the speaker identification algorithm and removed approximately the bottom 50% of utterances. Third, about 15% of the
remaining utterances were deemed by human transcribers to
be of insufficient clarity to transcribe reliably. After removing
those utterances, we obtained the 399,141 word corpus used
for all analyses in this paper.

Duration The duration predictor is a standardized measure
of word duration for each word. We first extracted duration
for all vowel tokens in the corpus. We next converted these
to normalized units for each vowel separately (via z-score),
and then measured the mean standardized vowel duration for
the tokens of a particular word type. For example, a high
score on this measure for the word “dog” would reflect that
the vowel that occurred in tokens of “dog” was often long
relative to comparable vowel sounds that appeared in other
words. We grouped similar vowels by converting transcripts
to phonemes via the CMU pronunciation dictionary.

and predictor variables.
AoA for the child’s early vocabulary. We use linear regression to provide a computational framework for this goal. We
therefore used age of acquisition as our outcome variable and
extracted six predictor variables to quantify aspects of CAS.
Figure 1 shows the pipeline used to extract these predictor
variables from our speech and transcription files. Below we
give our operational definition for age of acquisition and for
each of the six predictor variables we used in our analysis.
All variables are computed using the sample up to the AoA
for a particular word.
Age of Acquisition We defined the AoA for a particular
word as the first time in our transcripts that the child produced
a word. Using this definition, the first word was acquired at
nine months of age with an observed productive vocabulary
of 517 words by 24 months (though the actual productive vocabulary might be considerably larger when transcription is
completed). In order to ensure reliable estimates for all predictors, we excluded those words from the child’s vocabulary
for which there were fewer than six caregiver utterances. This
resulted in the exclusion of 56 of the child’s 517 words, leaving 461 total words included in the current analysis.
Frequency Frequency measures the count of word tokens
in CAS up to the time of acquisition of the word divided by
the period of time over which the count is made. Thus, this
measure captures the average frequency over time of a word
being used in CAS.
Recurrence Distinct from frequency, recurrence measures
the repetition of a particular word in caregiver speech within
a short window of time. The window size parameter was set
by searching all possible window sizes from 1 to 600 seconds. For each window size, we performed a univariate correlation analysis to calculate the correlation between recurrence
at that window size and AoA. We then selected the window
size which produced the largest correlation (51 seconds).
MLU The MLU predictor measures the mean utterance
length of caregiver speech containing a particular word. In
order to be consistent with the direction of correlation for

Fundamental frequency The fundamental frequency predictor is the measure of a word’s change in fundamental frequency (F0) relative to the utterance in which it occurred. We
first extracted the F0 contour for each utterance in the corpus
using the PRAAT system (Boersma & Weenink, 2009). We
then calculated the change in F0 as a sum of two terms shown
in the equation below. The first term captures the change in
F0 for the word relative to the utterance in which it’s embedded. F0w is the mean F0 value of the word, and F0utt is the
mean F0 of the whole utterance. The second term captures
the maximum change in F0 within the word. tmax and tmin are
the times at which the max and min F0 values occur within
the word. α0 and α1 are constants set using the same optimization technique described in the recurrence section.
α0 ∗ F0w − F0utt + α1 ∗

max(F0w ) − min(F0w )
tmax − tmin

Intensity Relative word intensity was calculated in the
same manner as F0 using the intensity contour in place of
the F0 contour. The intensity contour was extracted using the
PRAAT system.

Results
Correlation analysis
Correlations between AoA and the six variables we coded
in caregiver speech are shown in Figure 2. All correlations
were negative and highly significant (all p-values less than
.001) though their magnitude varied. Correlations with recurrence and intensity were largest, while correlation with F0
was smallest.
Replicating results in Roy et al. (2009), the correlation with
frequency was -.23. This figure is slightly lower than the -.29
reported in the earlier paper. There are two differences in
analysis that account for the different result. First, a small
subset of words were excluded from this analysis due to data
sparsity. Second, frequency data are estimated only up to the
time the child first produces the word. This second difference
leads to a potentially interesting conclusion. If the distribution of word frequencies is stationary with respect to time,
then correlations should go up as more data are included for

each word. In contrast, if caregivers tune the frequency distribution of words to an estimate of the child’s knowledge, correlations should go down as more data are included. Because
we observed (slightly) larger correlations with frequency for
the earlier dataset, this provides some evidence against caregiver tuning of word frequencies.
Correlations between predictor values are shown in Table
1. The largest correlations were between frequency and recurrence, frequency and intensity, and inverse MLU and duration. The correlation between frequency and recurrence is
easily interpreted: the more times a word appears, the more
likely it is to recur within a small window. On the other hand,
correlations between prosodic variables like frequency and
intensity or duration and inverse MLU are less clear. For example, perhaps words are more likely to have longer duration
vowels when they are being accented in a shorter sentence.

Regression analysis
We next constructed a regression model which attempted to
predict AoA as a function of a linear combination of predic-

tor values. The part of speech (POS) was included as an additional predictor. We created POS tags by first identifying
the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory category (Fenson, Marchman, Thal, Dale, & Reznick,
2007) for each word that appeared in the CDI and generalizing these labels to words that did not appear in the CDI lists.
To avoid sparsity, we next consolidated these categories into
five broad POS categories: adjectives, nouns, verbs, closedclass words, and other. The inclusion of POS as a predictor
significantly increased model fit (F(4) = 107.37, p < .001).
Coefficient estimates for each predictor are shown in Figure 3. All predictors were significant at the level of p < .05.
The full model had r2 = .32, suggesting that it captured a
substantial amount of variance in age of acquisition.
The largest coefficients in the model were for intensity and
inverse MLU. For example, there was a four-month predicted
difference between the words with the lowest inverse MLU
(“actual,” “rake,” “pot,” and “office”) and the words with the
highest inverse MLU (“hi,” “silver,” “hmm,” and “sarah”).
Effects of POS were significant and easily interpretable. We
used nouns as the base contrast level; thus, coefficients can be
interpreted as extra months of predicted time prior to acquiring a word of a non-noun POS. Closed-class words and verbs
were predicted to take almost two months longer to acquire
on average, while adjectives and other words were predicted
to take on average less than a month longer.

Assessing model fit
Residuals from the basic linear model were normally distributed. Figure 4 shows the relation between predicted age
of acquisition (via the full predictive model including part of

Predictors

Figure 3: Coefficient estimates for the full linear model including all six predictors (and part of speech as a separate
categorical predictor). Nouns are taken as the base level for
part of speech and thus no coefficient is fit for them. Error
bars show coefficient standard errors. For reasons of scale,
intercept is not shown.
speech) and the age of acquisition of words by the child. One
useful aspect of plotting the data in this way is that it makes
clear which words were outliers in our model (words whose
predicted age of acquisition is very different than their actual
age of acquisition). Identifying outliers can help us understand other factors involved in age of acquisition.
For example, words like “dad” and “nannyname” (proper
names have been replaced for privacy reasons) are learned far
earlier than predicted by the model (above the line of best
fit), due to their social salience. Simple and concrete nouns
like “apple” and “bus” are also learned earlier than predicted,
perhaps due to the ease of individuating them from the environment. In contrast, the child’s own name is spoken later
than predicted (20 months as opposed to 18), presumably not
because it is not known but because children say their own
name far less than their parents do. Future work will use these
errors of prediction as a starting point for understanding contextual factors influencing word learning.

Interactions and more complex models
Our first linear model had two limitations. First, we found
that there was significant variation in the effects of the six
predictors depending on what POS a word belonged to. Second, we did not include any interaction terms. We followed
up in two ways. First, in order to investigate differences in
predictor values between word classes we built separate linear
models for each POS. Second, we used stepwise regression to
investigate interactions in our larger model.

els, each one for a different group of words. None (including the “all” model) include a predictor for POS. Coefficient
estimates varied considerably across models, suggesting that
different factors are most important for the acquisition of different kinds of words. For example, frequency, intensity, and
inverse MLU were most important for nouns, suggesting that
hearing a noun often in short sentences where it is prosodically stressed leads to earlier acquisition. In contrast, adjective AoA was best predicted by intensity, duration, and inverse MLU, congruent with reports that children make use of
prosodic cues in identifying and learning adjectives (Thorpe
& Fernald, 2006). Finally, both verbs and closed-class words
were best predicted by recurrence, supporting the idea that
the meanings of these words may be difficult to decode from
context; hence frequent repetition within a particular context
would be likely to help (Gleitman, 1990).
We next constructed a model that included every pairwise
interaction between each of the six predictors and between
the predictors and POS. We then used stepwise regression to
remove predictors that did not increase model fit. Stepwise
regression prunes predictors using AIC, a measure which balances increases in likelihood with complexity. This model
increased r2 to .44, and added a large number of interaction

terms. We report only the general outlines of results in this
model as they confirm intuitions from other analyses.
While frequency had an overall positive coefficient value
in this model, all four interactions were negative, indicating that there was considerable shared information between
frequency and other predictors. Recurrence and intensity
also interacted significantly, suggesting that when words were
spoken repeatedly with high intensity (possibly because they
were a topic of discourse over a period of time) they were
acquired at earlier ages. Finally, both duration and intensity
interacted with POS, with significant coefficients for closedclass words. As seen in Table 2, longer closed-class words
are acquired slightly later (probably because longer closedclass words are less frequent). In addition, higher intensity
closed-class words are acquired considerably earlier, probably because one major challenge in function word acquisition
is understanding their prosodic structure (Demuth & McCullough, 2008).

Discussion and Future Work
Our study quantified six variables describing the prosodic
and distributional characteristics of words in child-available
caregiver speech: frequency, recurrence, mean length of utterance, duration, fundamental frequency, and intensity. We
found that each of these variables helped to predict the age
at which the child acquired words. There were considerable
differences in the predictive power of each variable across
different parts of speech, however. For example, frequency
and intensity mattered most for nouns, while recurrence in
a small window of time seemed to matter more for verbs
and closed-class words. These results complement previous
smaller-scale, cross-sectional investigations and provide a variety of new directions for potential experimental manipulations.
Our current model only takes into account variables in
caregiver speech, omitting the visual and social context of
word learning. One of the benefits of the Speechome Corpus
is that this information is available through rich video recordings. Computer vision algorithms and new video annotation
interfaces are being developed to incorporate this aspect of
the corpus into future investigations. In addition, our current
investigation has been limited to the child’s lexical development; our plan is that future work will extend the current analysis to grammatical development.
Finally, the analysis and findings presented in this paper
assume a linear input-output model between child and caregivers: the caregivers produce input to the child, who then
learns. In other words, our current model treats the child as
the only agent whose behavior can change. Beyond a first
approximation, however, this assumption is inconsistent with
our own previous findings (Roy et al., 2009). Our ongoing
work continues to investigate the mutual influences between
caregivers and child and to measure the degree of adaptation
in this dynamic social system.
