Abstract

Our proposal is to work within the overhypothesis framework to build a model of multiple language learning (MLL).
The reasoning behind the model is that with knowledge of
only one language, one possesses a limited amount of information about the possible features that languages can have:
for example, what sounds they use or what syntactic and morphological features they employ. For a monolingual speaker,
the general overhypothesis over how languages are structured, or what linguistic dimensions are relevant to assign
meaning, depends entirely on the knowledge of one’s single
native language (L1). This means that when learning an L2,
one is likely to assume that the L2 features are similar to those
of L1, a prediction confirmed by a large body of research in
L2 acquisition (Ritchie & Bhatia, 2009). On the other hand,
with at least some basic knowledge of two or more languages,
one can update the overhypothesis (or, rather, the set of overhypotheses, each related to a specific linguistic dimension)
by reevaluating which dimensions are relevant for each language. Structural differences between two or more languages
on any given dimension provide a basis for expanding the
hypothesis space (i.e., predictions about possible categories)
for this dimension. We hypothesize that this conceptually expanded hypothesis space facilitates learning of novel categories along relevant dimensions in an Ln due to the fact that
specific predictions about possible categories have already
been formed, which in turn accelerates their processing.
When applied at the level of sound, the model makes predictions regarding the ability of bi/multilingual learners to
discriminate novel contrasts along familiar dimensions in an
Ln. Auditory perception of nonnative contrasts is often initially impaired, but can significantly improve with increased
exposure. The explanation for this initial difficulty is that nonnative speech perception is shaped by the L1 experience, and
current theories are successful in predicting which L2 sounds
will be harder to initially perceive by listeners with a given
language background (Kuhl & Iverson, 1995; Best, 1995;
Flege, 1995). However, these models are not explicit about
how the L1 bias is overcome when nonnative phonological
categories are successfully learned. A possible answer is instead provided by the literature on perceptual categorization.
When learning phonological categories in L2, language learners adjust weights assigned to different phonetic dimensions
so that dimensions reliably aiding in proper phoneme categorization in L2 are given more weight, while dimensions
creating phonologically irrelevant variation are given almost
no weight (Kruschke, 1992; Strange & Shafer, 2008). Incorporating these theoretical assumption, the MLL model predicts that assigning high weight to a given phonetic dimension based on L2 input raises the likelihood of this dimension

We address the question of how previously acquired linguistic knowledge facilitates perception and learning of a new language. We report results from two experiments showing evidence that participants better discriminate a segmental duration
contrast in a novel language if they had some previous exposure to a language that uses duration contrastively. Crucially,
the perceptual advantage occurs even when the novel language
employs the contrast in entirely different conditions: in novel
segmental contexts and for novel segments, including a change
from application to vowels to application to consonants. We
take these results to suggest that language learners use their
knowledge of previously learned languages to make inferences
about the ways in which languages are likely to vary, which in
turn increases their perceptual sensitivity when languages do
in fact vary in the predicted ways.

Introduction
Second language (L2) acquisition and bilingualism have received a lot of attention in the literature over the past few
decades (for an overview, see e.g., Ritchie & Bhatia, 2009).
Significantly less research has been done on acquisition of
more than two languages, but it is now more widely recognized that acquisition of additional languages (Ln) is fundamentally different from L2 acquisition due to more possibilities for between-language interactions (De Angelis, 2007).
However, the mechanisms behind these between-language interactions are still very poorly understood.
One specific consequence of this limitation in scope to L2
acquisition has been a lack of systematic research investigating the common intuition that while learning an L2 is often
hard, learning each subsequent language becomes easier. We
explore this intuition by asking higher-level questions about
the learning process, as well as the nature of abstracting and
generalizing, with the goal to understand what mechanisms
would produce facilitation in Ln acquisition. A convenient
framework for asking these questions makes use of Goodman’s (1955) notion of “overhypothesis”. Goodman’s observation was that humans not only learn things that they experience directly, but they also infer abstract knowledge about
how the things they experience directly are structured. Imagine a stack of bags that contain colored marbles. You empty
a few of them and discover that some bags only have black
marbles, while others only have white ones. Now imagine
you pick a new bag and draw one marble which turns out to
be white. The experience with previous bags makes you hypothesize that this particular bag contains only white marbles.
This hypothesis is based on the overhypothesis you formed
through your overall experience with this stack of bags that
each bag contains marbles that are uniform in color.

also being considered as relevant in Ln. This, in turn, leads to
facilitation in perception and learning of novel Ln categories
that make use of this dimension.
As an example, consider the phonetic dimension of segmental duration. Imagine a native speaker of English who
also speaks Cantonese. In English, segmental duration is used
mainly as a prosodic cue (Klatt, 1976), while in Cantonese,
vowel duration can be considered a contrastive feature (Bauer
& Benedict, 1997), which means that words can potentially
be distinguished based solely on the duration of a given vowel
(short vs. long). The model assumes that this speaker has
formed an overhypothesis over the dimension of duration
stating that duration of segments can be relevant for assigning meaning in some languages. Crucially, even though the
speaker’s experience with duration is only based on vowel
segments, he/she is expected to have formed an overhypothesis over the duration dimension that is not segment-specific,
and consequently, to have formed hypotheses (or predictions)
regarding the relevance of duration for any segment. Now, if
this speaker is learning an Ln like Polish, which has a consonant duration contrast, the model predicts a facilitation in
learning this contrast, as compared to a learner who has not
had any previous exposure to any duration contrasts, and consequently no opportunity to form an overhypothesis over the
duration dimension.
Here we report the results of two experiments, in which
the perception of short vs. long consonants was tested. In
the first experiment, we tested speakers of American English
who had previously learned a language with contrastive consonant duration. We expected to observe a perceptual advantage for this group over English speakers without such experience. Furthermore, we tested whether the perceptual advantage generalizes to novel consonant segments and novel
segmental contexts. In the second experiment, we asked the
question of whether the feature of contrastive duration can be
generalized even further: namely, from vowels to consonants.
Specifically, we tested the perception of a consonant duration
contrast by speakers fluent in English and Cantonese, which
has a duration contrast for vowels, but not for consonants.

of the MLL model that the bilinguals have assigned a high
weight to the duration dimension in their L2, it was predicted that the bilingual group would perform better than the
monolingual group. Furthermore, the perception of the duration contrast was tested in different phonotactic environments (here, the position in a word and the adjacent segments). While some theories assume that learning new contrasts is context-specific (Flege, 1995), the proposed model
predicts that the abstracted knowledge should allow generalization across different environments. Additional comparisons within the bilingual group were planned in order to investigate more closely the process of generalization from previous knowledge. In particular, it was predicted that the bilingual participants would be able to generalize their perceptual
capacity for duration contrasts to novel segments, and – following the underlying principle of the overhypothesis framework – that familiarity with the contrast in at least two different contexts would faciliate generalization to a novel context
more than its familiarity in only one context.

Experiment 1

Materials The materials consisted of nonce words constructed around either a long or a short target consonant.
The target consonants were placed in four different contexts
created by crossing two conditions: word position (medial
vs. initial) with following segment (vowel vs. consonant).
All the bilingual participants had previous exposure to the
contrast in the word-medial prevocalic (or intervocalic) context, while none had previous exposure to the contrast in the
word-initial preconsonantal context. Two different types of
segments were used: voiceless alveolar fricatives [s]/[ss] and
voiced alveolar fricatives [z]/[zz], resulting in a total of eight
conditions. The materials are shown in Table 1.

Method
Participants 80 undergraduate students at UC San Diego
participated in the experiment for course credit: 40 “monolinguals” and 40 “bilinguals”. The bilingual group was largely
heterogeneous. It consisted of speakers of a total of 17 different L2s, and varied in their proficiency in L2, as well as
the manner of exposure to L2 (school instruction or exposure
at home through family members). The bilingual participants
were further split in two ways depending on the types of segments possible as long consonants and the positions in which
they occur in their L2. The division by “segment” included
“[ss] bilinguals” who were only familiar with long [s], and
“[ss] & [zz] bilinguals” who were familiar with both long [s]
and long [z]. The division by “context” included “intervocalic
bilinguals” who were only familiar with long consonants in
the intervocalic context, and “intervocalic+ bilinguals” who
were familiar with the contrast in the intervocalic context
plus in at least one other context (word-medial preconsonantal and/or word-initial prevocalic).

In an AX discrimination task we tested the perception of
a consonant duration contrast (short vs. long) by a “bilingual group”: native (or near-native) speakers of American English with previous exposure to another language that uses
consonant duration contrastively (e.g., Japanese or Italian).
The control “monolingual group” consisted of native speakers of American English with no previous exposure to any
language that contrasts duration.1 Following the assumption
1 American English does not use duration contrastively. Vowel
duration varies, but it correlates with the tense-lax distinction (e.g.,
beat vs. bit) or depends on the voicing of the following segment
(e.g., cad vs. cat). Long consonants are sometimes attested but only
at morpheme boundaries (e.g., dissatisfied; Benus, Smorodinsky, &
Gafos, 2003). Minimal pairs are rare (e.g., unnamed vs. unaimed),
and for most speakers the contrast in neutralized (Kaye, 2005).

Furthermore, there is evidence that by 18 months of age Englishlearning infants process duration contrasts differently from infants
learning a language that contrasts duration (e.g., Japanese; Mugitani,
Pons, Fais, Werker, & Amano, 2008).

The materials were recorded by a male native speaker of
Moroccan Arabic since all the words were phonotactically
legal in this language. For each test word, 18 repetitions were
recorded. The duration of the fricatives was measured, and
five tokens with fricatives that approximated mean duration
for each condition were selected for use in the experiment.
The trials consisted of an equal number of “different” pairs
(e.g., asa-assa) and “same” pairs (e.g., assa-assa or asa-asa).
Even in the “same” pairs, the first and second words in each
pair were always physically different tokens, and were separated by an interstimulus interval of 500ms. Each participant
heard 12 “different” pairs and 12 “same” pairs for each of the
eight conditions. There was a total of 384 pairs in the experiment: 192 test pairs and 192 fillers.

yields values between 0 and 1, where 1 means ‘perfect discriminability’ and 0.5 is chance performance.
Monolinguals vs. bilinguals The results are plotted in
Fig. 1. We analyzed the scores using a repeated measures
ANOVA with the within-participants factors position (‘medial’ or ‘initial’), following segment (‘vowel’ or ‘consonant’), voicing (‘voiced’ or ‘voiceless’), and the betweenparticipants factor language background (‘monolingual’ or
‘bilingual’). There was a significant main effect of language
background [F(1, 78) = 12.8; p < .001] with the bilingual
group performing better (Ā0 = 0.79) than the monolingual
group (Ā0 = 0.72).
There was also a significant interaction between language
background and following segment [F(1, 78) = 11.4; p < .01],
and a three-way interaction between language background,
following segment and position [F(1, 78) = 4.2; p < .05]. The
difference in performance between monolinguals and bilinguals was larger in preconsonantal than in prevocalic contexts, and was especially striking in the word-initial, preconsonantal contexts.
In addition, there were significant main effects of position
[F(1,78)=34.6; p<.001] and following segment [F(1, 78) =
64.8; p < .001] independent of language background. That is,
both groups performed better when the contrast was in wordmedial (vs. word-initial) contexts, and better when it was prevocalic (vs. preconsonantal).

Procedure The experiment began with a practice session
during which participants listened to 16 filler stimuli (8 “different” and 8 “same” pairs) over headphones, and were asked
to respond by clicking on one of two answer boxes displayed
on the computer screen saying “same word” or “different
words”. No feedback was given during the practice session.
The test trials followed immediately after the practice session.
Participants were presented with six 64-trial blocks. On each
trial, a stimulus was presented aurally through headphones,
and the participant responded by clicking on one of the two
boxes on the computer screen. Each stimulus was played once
without a replay option. The response to one stimulus triggered the presentation of the following stimulus with a delay
of 500ms. The stimuli order was randomized for every participant. There was a self-terminated break after each block.

Bilinguals: segments Two groups of bilinguals were compared depending on the segments that occur as long consonants in their L2. The results are plotted in Fig. 2. We analyzed the scores using a repeated measures ANOVA with the
same as before within-participants factors position (‘medial’
or ‘initial’), following segment (‘vowel’ or ‘consonant’), voicing (‘voiced’ or ‘voiceless’), and the between-participants
factor L2-long-consonant-segment (‘[ss] bilinguals’ or ‘[ss]
& [zz] bilinguals’). The two groups of bilinguals were balanced by randomly removing participants from the larger
group, leaving a total of 20 participants for this comparison.
No significant main effect of L2-long-consonant-segment

Results
We calculated A-prime scores for each participant and each
condition (the same results hold for d-prime). A-prime (Grier,
1971) was used to measure the participants’ capacity to
perceive the short/long consonant contrast, and is a nonparametric analog of d-prime. Both A-prime and d-prime are
measures of sensitivity to a given contrast, and are calculated
by taking into account the proportion of Hits (responding ‘different’ when the stimulus is ‘different’) and False Alarms (responding ‘different’ when the stimulus is ‘same’).2 A-prime

formula used for calculating A-prime was the following:
(H−FA)(1+H−FA)
= 0.5 +

ing segment [F(1, 30) = 19.5; p < .001]. As before, both
groups performed better when the contrast was in wordmedial (vs. word-initial) contexts, and better when it was prevocalic (vs. preconsonantal).

As predicted, the participants performed better on the
short/long consonant contrast than monolingual participants.
Importantly, the effect was observed despite high heterogeneity of the bilingual group in terms of their L2 background, the
shared feature being the presence of the short/long consonant
contrast in every L2. All the bilingual participants seemed to
be able to use a similar kind of perceptual capacity which
emerged from their different backgrounds. This result provides support for the hypothesis that previous exposure to
duration contrasts in an L2 improves perception of a similar
contrast in a novel language.
Furthermore, better performance by bilinguals was not
simply a result of direct incorporation of certain elements
from L2 to a novel language, because – as predicted – the
bilinguals were able to generalize their perceptual capacity
to novel segments (at least across voicing of segments) and
novel contexts. Thus, the perceptual capacity was not found
to be context-specific, even though some contexts may be perceptually harder than others.
Finally, following the hypothesis, the bilinguals whose L2
made the contrast in at least two different contexts (intervocalic, word-medial preconsonantal and/or word-initial prevocalic) performed better in the novel word-initial preconsonantal context than the group whose L2 only used the contrast
intervocalically. This suggests that, while exposure to at least
one segmental context of a duration contrast helps with the
overall perception (as is the case for the “intervocalic bilinguals”), it is the exposure to at least two different contexts
that allows for a real boost in perceptual capacity (as observed
for the “intervocalic+ bilinguals”). This result can be interpreted as a supporting piece of evidence for the overhypothesis framework: exposure to a contrast in at least two contexts
allows for the formation of an overhypothesis that this particular contrast can occur in many different contexts. Interestingly, the “intervocalic+ bilinguals” also performed better
than the “intervocalic bilinguals” in the intervocalic context,
to which all the bilinguals had equal exposure. While this result does not directly follow from the hypothesis, it might be
that forming the overhypothesis over contexts makes the perceptual system more attuned to the contrast in any context,
either novel or non-novel.

There were also significant main effects of position

which long consonants are possible in their L2. The results are plotted in Fig. 3. We analyzed the scores using

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 was designed in order to test whether the feature of contrastive duration can be generalized further than
across voicing of segments, namely, from vowels to consonants. The participants were speakers of Cantonese (also fluent in Mandarin) and speakers of Mandarin with no knowledge of Cantonese. Cantonese has vowel duration contrasts,
but no consonant duration contrasts, while Mandarin does

cally identical and the “different” words in each pair always
shared a physically identical frame (i.e., the words were identical except for artificial lengthening for duration contrasts
and a spliced consonant for sibilant contrasts). This was done
to ensure that any difference in the participants’ responses
resulted only from the manipulation of interest. The words
in each pair were separated by an interstimulus interval of
750ms. Each pair was repeated twice throughout the experiment, which yielded a total of 392 pairs: 196 pairs with duration contrasts and 196 pairs with sibilant or other (filler)
contrasts.

Method
Participants 40 undergraduate students at UC San Diego
participated in the experiment for course credit. 20 were native speakers of Mandarin fluent in English, and the other 20
were native speakers of Cantonese fluent in English and at
least competent in Mandarin.
Materials The materials consisted of two types of stimuli,
as shown in Table 2.

Procedure The procedure was almost identical to experiment 1. The differences included the number of blocks (seven
56-trial blocks) and the response type: instead of clicking on
the screen with a mouse, participants responded by pushing
buttons on a game pad.

not use duration of any segments contrastively. To control
for differences in populations, the experiment also included
stimuli with a sibilant contrast from Polish, which were chosen because similar consonants form part of the Mandarin
consonant inventory. Thus, the two groups of participants
(Cantonese/Mandarin and Mandarin) were exposed to two
types of stimuli: duration contrasts (short vs. long consonants) and sibilant contrasts (alveolo-palatal vs. postalveolar/retroflex consonants). The MLL model predicted that
Cantonese speakers would perform better than Mandarin
speakers on the duration contrast due to their experience
with the vowel duration contrast in Cantonese. However, both
groups were predicted to perform equally well on the sibilant contrast due to their familiarity with a similar contrast
in Mandarin (although a slight advantage for the native Mandarin speakers was expected for this contrast).

Results
As in Experiment 1, we calculated A-prime scores for each
participant in each condition as a measure of contrast sensitivity (the same results hold for d-prime).

This created 4 conditions by crossing two factors: contrast (duration or sibilant) with language background (Cantonese/Mandarin or Mandarin).
Each contrast was embedded in seven different frames:
[pa_a], [pe_a], [po_a], [ta_a], [te_a], [ka_a], [ke_a]. All the
words were recorded by a phonetically-trained native speaker
of Polish with five repetions of each word. One token of each
stimulus type was chosen as a frame (a short consonant token for duration contrasts and a postalveolar/retroflex token
for sibilant contrasts). The target consonants were spliced out
from different tokens. Long consonants were created from the
short consonants by either doubling their length (for sonorant
consonants: [j], [w], [l], [m], and [n]) or elongating it by half
its length (for obstruent consonants: [f] and [s]).3 The stimuli were created by pairing words that were “different” (e.g.,
paja-pajja) and “same” (e.g., paja-paja or pajja-pajja). Unlike
in Experiment 1, the “same” words in each pair were physi-

hypothesis framework, which predict that knowledge of previously learned languages is generalized and leads language
learners to make inferences about the ways in which languages are likely to vary. These inferences, or overhypotheses, about dimensions along which languages can differ may
in turn increase learners’ perceptual sensitivity to contrasts
that the overhypotheses predict. Having established that such
generalization occurs from previously learned to novel languages, the next step for future work will be to determine the
exact conditions under which overhypotheses are made, and
in what exact ways they are used in language learning.

This experiment showed that the speakers of Cantonese/Mandarin perform better on the short/long consonant
duration contrast than Mandarin speakers without any exposure to Cantonese. It was hypothesized that such a difference
between the two groups would be observed due to the fact
that Cantonese uses vowel duration contrastively. This result
suggests that Cantonese speakers were able to generalize their
knowledge about a vowel duration contrast to a consonant duration contrast in a way that perception of the latter contrast
was facilitated.
Importantly, the better performance of the Cantonese participants was not due to other differences in populations since
the two groups performed equally well on the control contrast
of sibilants. In this case, both groups were predicted to perform similarly due to the influence of Mandarin, which has a
similar contrast between voiceless sibilants.
The combination of these results means that the feature of
contrastive duration can indeed be abstracted away from a
limited set of segments (e.g., vowels) and applied in novel
conditions with a perceptual advantage, thus supporting the
predictions of the model.

Conclusion
This paper argued that previously acquired linguistic knowledge can have a facilitative effect on perception and learning
of new languages. In Experiment 1, we showed that participants with previous exposure to a language that uses consonant duration contrastively are better at discriminating a
similar duration contrast in a novel language. Perceptual advantage was observed even if the contrast was presented in
novel segmental contexts and for novel segments. Experiment 2 showed an even stronger result: perceptual advantage
on consonant duration contrasts was observed for participants
who only had previous exposure to vowel duration contrasts.
Together, these results support the MLL model and the over-
