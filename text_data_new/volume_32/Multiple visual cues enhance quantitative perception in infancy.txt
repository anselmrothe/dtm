Abstract
Infants possess basic capabilities to assess various
quantitative properties such as number, size, and time.
Preverbal discriminations are approximate, however, and
similarly limited by ratio across these dimensions. Here, we
present the first evidence that redundant quantitative
unisensory information—namely, simultaneous visual cues
to both number and size—accelerates six-month-olds’
quantitative competence. Using a habituation-dishabituation
paradigm, results demonstrate that, when provided with
synchronous visual cues to different quantitative properties,
infants make more precise discriminations than when they
receive information about a single cue alone. Such redundant
conceptual information may be more salient than nonredundant information, which could better recruit attention
and result in more precise learning and remembering than
when such information is presented through only one cue.

Introduction
Even before they acquire language, infants are capable of
perceiving various quantitative dimensions such as time,
size, and number (e.g., Brannon, Lutz, and Cordes, 2006;
Jordan, Suanda, and Brannon, 2008; Lipton and Spelke,
2003; Wood and Spelke, 2005; Xu and Spelke, 2000; Xu,
2003; Xu et al., 2005). This ability is approximate in that it
follows predictions made by Weber’s Law: infants’ ability
to distinguish between two magnitudes is a function of the
ratio between the competing magnitudes (e.g., Xu, &
Spelke, 2000; Bijeljac-Babic, Bertioncini, & Mehler, 1993;
Brannon, Abbot, & Lutz, 2004; Gao, Levine, &
Huttenlocher, 2000; Izard, Sann, Spelke, & Streri, 2009).
For example, six month-olds successfully distinguish a 1:2
size change of a visual object, but fail to notice a 2:3 size
change (Brannon, Lutz, & Cordes, 2006). Similarly, when
tested with visual stimuli, six-month-old infants require a
1:2 ratio for successful discrimination of large numerical
sets, failing to discriminate a 2:3 ratio change (e.g., Wood
and Spelke, 2005; Xu and Spelke, 2000; Xu, 2003; Xu et al.,
2005). By 9 months of age, however, infants successfully
discriminate a 2:3 change in number (Lipton, & Spelke,

2003). This pattern suggests that discrimination abilities of
infants show similar perceptual and cognitive limits across
various dimensions of visual quantity.
When provided with redundant information about
quantity through multiple sensory modalities, however,
infants’ discrimination abilities improve to a level
previously thought attainable only after additional months
of development. For example, although six-month-old
infants fail to distinguish a 2:3 ratio change in number when
provided with a single visual cue to number, they succeed
when given cues simultaneously in both the visual and
auditory modalities (Jordan, Suanda, & Brannon, 2008).
Five-month-olds discriminate differing rhythmic patterns
when presented audiovisually, but fail when presented only
with a cue from the auditory or visual modality alone
(Bahrick and Lickliter, 2000). Similarly, 3-month-olds are
capable of discriminating differing tempos only when they
are presented redundantly across multiple modalities
(Bahrick, Flom, and Lickliter, 2002).
This tendency for infants’ perceptual abilities to improve
when provided with multiple synchronous sensory cues has
been explained by the Intersensory Redundancy Hypothesis
(see Bahrick and Lickliter, 2000 for review). The hypothesis
states that redundant stimulation from multiple sensory
modalities efficiently recruits infants’ attention by providing
overlapping sensory information, thereby causing the
redundantly specified property to become perceptual
“foreground”, while other sensory stimulation remains
“background”. This, in turn, fosters perceptual
differentiation, learning, and memory for redundant, amodal
properties before other unisensory, modality-specific
stimulus properties.
The effect of intrasensory redundancy on infants’
cognitive abilities, however, remains to be empirically
tested. Multisensory stimulation in the form of intersensory
redundancy may not be the only way to boost infant
quantitative competency; the multiple numerical cues
provided by intersensory redundancy may be more
important than the multisensory nature of the stimulation
itself. Redundant conceptual information, regardless of

2799

sensory modality, may be more salient than non-redundant
information, which could better recruit attention and result
in more precise learning and remembering than when such
information is presented through only one cue. Here, we
test the hypothesis that redundant visual stimuli will
improve infants’ quantitative discrimination abilities.

Methods

total inter-event interval were approximately equal for the 8bounce and 12-bounce sequence.
There were six distinct habituation sequences for 8- and
12- bounce events. During the habituation phase, the six
movies in each condition repeated in random order for 16
trials, or until the infant met the habituation criterion. The
six test trials consisted of novel 8- and 12-bounce movies
shown in alternation, and occurred randomly without
replacement for the first six habituation trials.

Surface area, circumference, and diameter remained constant
within each trial type for 8 and 12 bounce videos respectively.
Surface Area (8 = 14.07cm, 12 = 21.11cm); Circumference (8
=13.30cm, 12 = 16.28cm); Diameter (8 = 4.23cm, 12 =5.18cm).

Stimuli
Infants were habituated to silent movie events of a ball
that appeared to drop and then bounce up after making
contact with a surface (see Jordan, Suanda, and Brannon,
2008). The size of the ball differed depending on its number
of bounces: A ball which bounced 8 times (14.07 cm)
covered exactly two-thirds of the total surface area as a ball
which bounced 12 times (21.11 cm). The size of the
individual ball was fixed and did not vary during the movie.
Movies were constructed using Macromedia Flash and
displayed on a computer within a 19 x 23 cm area.
Temporal parameters (Table 1) were controlled following
Wood and Spelke (2005). During habituation, rate, duration,
inter-event interval, and height of individual ball bounces
were approximately equal for the 8- and 12-bounce
sequences and were constant within trial but varied across
trial. Therefore, on average during habituation 12-bounce
sequences lasted longer and contained more motion than 8bounce sequences. In contrast, during test sequences, total
sequence duration, cumulative height of ball bouncing, and

Infants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions.
Thirteen infants were habituated to a silent movie in which a
ball bounced 8 times, while the remaining 15 infants were
habituated to a silent movie in which a ball bounced 12
times. The size of the ball which bounced 8 times was
exactly two-thirds the surface area of the ball that bounced
12 times. Following habituation, infants were tested with
novel silent movies in which the ball bounced 8 or 12 times
in alternation for six trials (order counterbalanced). The
relative size difference of the balls bouncing 8 versus 12
times remained during test. Importantly, these stimuli
closely mirror previous studies (see Jordan, Suanda, and
Brannon, 2008 for test of 6-month-olds with these exact
stimuli on number discriminations; see Brannon, Lutz, and
Cordes, 2006 for test of 6-month-olds on discriminating this
ratio of surface area), which demonstrated that 6-month-old
infants fail to discriminate this ratio when either number or
surface area are tested in isolation.

Table 1. Habituation and test trial parameters

Twenty eight full-term six-month-old infants were tested
(female= 14, mean age = 6 months 2 days; range: 5 months
15 days to 6 months 14 days). Participants were recruited
from birth records obtained from the Utah Department of
Health.

Apparatus and Procedure
Infants sat on their guardian’s lap approximately 60 cm
away from a large monitor. Each test trial was initiated by
the experimenter when the infant was looking in the
direction of the monitor. Following the movie sequence, the
last frame of the video was held fixed and remained on the
screen for the remainder of the trial. Looking time to the
fixed frame was recorded until the infant looked away for a
continuous 2 seconds after looking at the fixed image for a
minimum of 1 s, or after a maximum of 60 s. The
habituation phase continued until the infant met the
habituation criterion, defined as a 50% reduction in looking
time over 3 consecutive trials relative to the first 3 trials that
summed to at least 12 s, or until 16 trials were completed.
The test phase consisted of silent movies, three of which

2800

consisted of 8-bounce and three of which consisted of 12bounce events.
A micro-camera monitoring the infant’s face and a feed
from the stimulus presentation computer were multiplexed
onto a TV monitor and VCR. Each session was recorded for
later reliability coding. Inter-rater reliability averaged
93.63% for all infants. Twenty-five percent of infants were
coded by a single trained coder.

final three habituation trials (t(27) = .641, p = .527, Cohen’s
d = .251).

Results
An alpha of .05 was used for all comparisons. Infants
required an average of 9.68 trials to reach habituation.
Twenty five of the 28 infants reached habituation before all
16 habituation trials were complete. A paired-sample t test
indicated that infants viewed the first 3 habitation trials
significantly longer than the final 3 habituation trials, t(27)
= 9.46, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 3.71.
Binomial sign tests indicate that the number of infants
who looked longer at novel test trial types (n = 19) was
significantly larger than the number of infants who looked
longer at familiar test trial types (n = 9) (sign-test, p = .043).

A 2 x 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA was used to
examine the relationship between the between-subject
factors, gender and habituation condition (eight vs. twelve),
and the within-subject factor, test trial type (novel vs.
familiar). This analysis identified a significant main effect
of test trial type, indicating that looking time within novel
test trial types (µ = 6.92 seconds) were significantly longer
than looking times within familiar test trial types (µ = 4.62
seconds; F(1, 24) = 6.459, MSE = 12.02, p = .018, Cohen’s
d = .689). No other main effects or interactions were
significant.
A priori paired samples t test comparisons between pairs
of novel and familiar test trials identified significant looking
time differences between the first pair of novel and familiar
test trials (t(27) = 2.474, p = .02, Cohen’s d = .970), and the
second pair of novel and familiar test trials (t(27) = 2.196, p
= .037, Cohen’s d = .861). However, looking time between
novel and familiar test trials within the third pair of test
trials were not significantly different (t(27) = -.858, p =
.399, Cohen’s d = .336). Infants looked significantly longer
at novel test trials than the final three habituation trials
(t(27) = 3.26, p = .003, Cohen’s d = 1.28). However,
looking times for familiar test trials did not differ from the

Discussion
These results demonstrate that infants’ quantitative visual
discriminations do not adhere to one strict ratio limit. With
visual stimuli providing two simultaneous quantitative cues,
six-month-old infants make more precise discriminations
than previously reported in other studies when they received
information about either number or surface area alone
(Jordan, Suanda, and Brannon, 2008; Brannon, Lutz, and
Cordes, 2006)). Our experiment is therefore the first to
demonstrate an increase in quantitative precision resulting
from redundant information provided by synchronous visual
cues.
Past research has demonstrated that multiple sources of
information presented across sensory modalities must be
synchronous in order to be beneficial to infant learning in
various domains (Bahrick, & Lickliter, 2000). In the current
experiment, the change in number and surface area occurred
in synchrony; however, the change did not occur across
sensory modalities. Thus, multisensory stimulation in the

2801

form of intersensory redundancy is not the only way to
boost infant quantitative competence (Jordan et al., 2008).
Instead, the multiple numerical cues provided by
intersensory redundancy may be more important than the
multisensory nature of the stimulation itself. Redundant
conceptual information, regardless of sensory modality, may
be more salient than non-redundant information, which
could better recruit attention and result in more precise
learning and remembering than when such information is
presented through only one cue.
The exact mechanism through which infants accomplish
this feat remains unknown. Recent epigenetic theories
suggest that infants are endowed with basic capabilities to
detect and process intersensory stimuli at birth, but that
experiences throughout development are necessary to
enhance these abilities (Lewkowicz, 2000). These
experiences may begin in utero (Kisilevsky, 1995; Schaal,
Orgeur, & Rognon, 1995; Bekoff, 1995), and continue
throughout infancy and into childhood (Milner, & Bryant,
1968). However, as suggested by Lewkowicz (2000) only
relatively recently have studies begun acknowledging and
investigating the pervasive effects of multimodal
stimulation on infants’ perceptual abilities.
One area that has until recently been largely overlooked
are infants’ abilities to learn from synchronous stimulation
within a single sensory modality. In their everyday
environments, it is possible that infants experience
synchronous unisensory stimulation no less often than they
experience
synchronous
multisensory
stimulation.
Therefore, given the proposed importance of experience on
the development of perceptual capabilities, the capacity of
infants to perceive synchronous unisensory cues may be
similar to their capacity to perceive synchronous
multisensory cues in many domains. The current results
mark an initial step in better understanding how infants
utilize multiple temporally and spatially synchronous cues
from the same sensory modality.
Our results are the first to indicate that infants’ abilities to
discriminate between quantities are improved by the
presentation of redundant intrasensory cues. Redundant
visual stimulation may cause more effective encoding of
quantity by selectively recruiting infants’ attention to visual
properties of magnitude, thereby resulting in increased
neural responsiveness to synchronous, redundant
quantitative information. Therefore, when given multiple
synchronous intrasensory cues, infants may have
experienced greater signal strength and decreased variance
for their ratio-dependent quantitative representations in
memory.
It is necessary, however, to investigate the physiological
bases of this enhanced quantitative ability in order to clarify
potential causes and correlates. Recent findings have shown
promise in identifying patterns of brain activation
specifically involved in numerical understanding, even in
infancy (Libertus, Pruitt, Woldorff, & Brannon, 2009). It
has been hypothesized that there may be similar mental
algorithms and neural areas devoted to common magnitude

processing, as opposed to completely discrete,
compartmentalized areas responsible for processing specific
quantitative properties individually (e.g., Cantlon et al.,
2009).
Much work is still needed now to determine the extent of
these findings. For instance, what other synchronous visual
stimulation is capable of improving infants’ quantitative
abilities? Do these findings generalize outside of the domain
of quantity, across other amodal properties? Does
discrimination of properties in other sensory modalities such
as audition benefit from synchronous intrasensory
presentation? To better understand the role of synchrony in
producing such effects, it would also be informative in the
future to provide infants with the same overall amount of
information about size and number changes, but to present
these changes asynchronously. These questions should be
addressed before we can begin to understand the limits of
infant intrasensory processing capabilities.
