Abstract

associate emotions with various facial expressions (Tolbert,
2001). Scherer presents a framework for formally describing the emotional effects of music and then outlines factors
that contribute to these emotions, including structural, performance, listener, and contextual features (Scherer, 2001).
In this paper, we focus on some of the structural aspects of
music and the manner in which they contribute to emotions in
music. We present a cognitive model of characteristics of music responsible for human perception of emotional content.
Our model is both discriminative and generative; it is capable
of detecting a variety of emotions in musical selections, and
also of producing music targeted to a specific emotion.

We present a system designed to model characteristics which
contribute to the emotional content of music. It creates n-gram
models, Hidden Markov Models, and entropy-based models
from corpora of musical selections representing various
emotions. These models can be used both to identify emotional content and generate pieces representative of a target
emotion. According to survey results, generated selections
were able to communicate a desired emotion as effectively as
human-generated compositions.

Introduction
Music and emotion are intrinsically linked; music is able
to express emotions that cannot adequately be expressed by
words alone. Often, there is strong consensus among listeners as to what type of emotion is being expressed in a particular piece (Gabrielsson & Lindstrom, 2001; Juslin, 2001).
There is even some evidence to suggest that some perceptions
of emotion in music may be innate. For example, selections
sharing some acoustical properties of fear vocalizations, such
as sudden onset, high pitch, and strong energy in the high frequency range, often provoke physiological defense responses
(Ohman, 1988). Researchers have demonstrated similar lowlevel detection mechanisms for both pleasantness and novelty.
(Scherer, 1984, 1988). There also appears to be some inborn
preference for consonance over dissonance. In studies with
infants, researchers found that their subjects looked significantly longer at the source of sound and were less likely to
squirm and fret when presented with consonant as opposed to
dissonant versions of a melody (Zentner & Kagan, 1996).
There are a variety of theories as to what aspects of music are most responsible for eliciting emotional responses.
Meyer theorizes that meaning in music comes from following
or deviating from an expected structure (Meyer, 1956). Sloboda emphasizes the importance of associations in the perception of emotion in music and gives particular emphasis
to association with lyrics as a source for emotional meaning
(Sloboda, 1985). Kivy argues for the importance of cultural
factors in understanding emotion and music, proposing that
the “emotive life” of a culture plays a major role in the emotions that members of that culture will detect in their music
(Kivy, 1980). Tolbert proposes that children learn to associate
emotion with music in much the same way that they learn to

Related Work
A number of researchers have addressed the task of modeling
musical structure for the purposes of building a generative
musical system. Conklin summarizes a number of statistical models which can be used for music generation, including random walk, Hidden Markov Models, stochastic sampling, and pattern-based sampling (Conklin, 2003). These
approaches can be seen in a number of different studies. For
example, Hidden Markov Models have been used to harmonize melodies, considering melodic notes as observed events
and a chord progression as a series of hidden states (Allan &
Williams, 2005). Similarly, Markov chains have been used
to harmonize given melody lines, focusing on harmonization
in a given style in addition to finding highly probable chords
(Chuan & Chew, 2007).
Wiggins, Pearce, and Mullensiefen present a system designed to model factors such as pitch expectancy and melodic
segmentation. They also demonstrate that their system can
successfully generate music in a given style (Wiggins, Pearce,
& Mullensiefen, 2009). Systems have also been developed
to produce compositions with targeted emotional content.
Delgado, Fajardo, and Molina-Solana use a rule-based system to generate compositions according to a specified mood
(Delgado, Fajardo, & Molina-Solana, 2009). Rutherford and
Wiggins analyze the features that contribute to the emotion
of fear in a musical selection and present a system that allows
for an input parameter that determines the level of “scariness”
in the piece (Rutherford & Wiggins, 2003). Oliveira and Cardoso describe a wide array of features that contribute to emotional content in music and present a system that uses this

2356

information to select and transform chunks of music in accordance with a target emotion (Oliveira & Cardoso, 2007).
The authors have also developed a system that addresses the
task of composing music with a specified emotional content
(Monteith, Martinez, & Ventura, 2010). In this paper, we
illustrate how our system can be interpreted as a cognitive
model of human perception of emotional content in music.

Methodology
The proposed system constructs statistical and entropic models for various emotions based on corpora of human-labeled
musical data. Analysis of these models provides insights as to
why certain music evokes certain emotions. The models supply localized information about intervals and chords that are
more common to music conveying a specific emotion. They
also supply information about what overall melodic characteristics contribute to emotional content. To validate our findings, we generate a number of musical selections and ask research subjects to label the emotional content of the generated music. Similar experiments are conducted with humangenerated music commissioned for the project. We then observe the correlations between subject responses and our predictions of emotional content.
Initial experiments focus on the six basic emotions outlined
by Parrott (Parrott, 2001)—love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness,
and fear—creating a data set representative of each. A separate set of musical selections is compiled for each of the emotions studied. Selections for the training corpora are taken
from movie soundtracks due to the wide emotional range
present in this genre of music. MIDI files used in the experiments can be found at the Free MIDI File Database.1 These
MIDI files were rated by a group of research subjects. Each
selection was rated by at least six subjects, and selections
rated by over 80% of subjects as representative of a given
emotion were then selected for use in the training corpora.
Selections used for these experiments are shown in Figure 1.
Next, the system analyzes the selections to create statistical models of the data in the six corpora. Selections are first
transposed into the same key. Melodies are then analyzed
and n-gram models are generated representing what notes are
most likely to follow a given series of notes in a given corpus.
Statistics describing the probability of a melody note given
a chord, and the probability of a chord given the previous
chord, are collected for each of the six corpora. Information
is also gathered about the rhythms, the accompaniment patterns, and the instrumentation present in the songs.
The system also makes use of decision trees constructed
to model the characteristics that contribute to emotional content. These trees are constructed using the C4.5 algorithm
(Quinlan, 1993), an extension of the ID3 algorithm (Quinlan,
1986) that allows for real-valued attributes. The decision tree
classifiers classifiers allow for a more global analysis of generated melodies. Inputs to these classifiers are the default features extracted by the “Phrase Analysis” component of the

a vector of twenty-one statistics describing a given melody,
including factors such as number of consecutive identical
pitches, number of distinct rhythmic values, tonal deviation,
and key-centeredness. These statistics are calculated for both
the major and minor scales.
A separate set of classifiers is developed to evaluate both
generated rhythms and generated pitches. The first classifier in each set is trained using analyzed selections in the
target corpus as positive training instances and analyzed selections from the other corpora as negative instances. This
is intended to help the system distinguish selections containing the desired emotion. The second classifier in each set is
trained with melodies from all corpora versus melodies previously generated by the algorithm, allowing the system to learn
melodic characteristics of selections which have already been

For the generative portion of the model, the system employs four different components: a Rhythm Generator, a Pitch
Generator, a Chord Generator, and an Accompaniment and
Instrumentation Planner. The functions of these components
are explained in more detail in the following sections.

Rhythm Generator
The rhythm for the selection with a desired emotional content
is generated by selecting a phrase from a randomly chosen selection in the corresponding data set. The rhythmic phrase is
then altered by selecting and modifying a random number of
measures. The musical forms of all the selections in the corpus are analyzed, and a form for the new selection is drawn
from a distribution representing these forms. For example,
a very simple AAAA form, where each of four successive
phrases contains notes with the same rhythm values, tends to
be very common. Each new rhythmic phrase is analyzed by
jMusic and then provided as input to the rhythm evaluators.
Generated phrases are only accepted if they are classified positively by both classifiers.

Pitch Generator
Once the rhythm is determined, pitches are selected for the
melodic line. These pitches are drawn according to the ngram model constructed from melody lines of the corpus with
the desired emotion. A melody is initialized with a series of
random notes, selected from a distribution that models notes
most likely to begin musical selections in the given corpus.
Additional notes in the melodic sequence are randomly selected based on a probability distribution of note mosts likely
to follow the given series of n notes.
For example, with the “joy” corpus, the note sequence (C4,
D4, E4) has a 0.667 probability of being followed by an F4,
a 0.167 probability of being followed by a D4, and a 0.167
probability of being followed by a C4. If these three notes
were to appear in succession in a generated selection, the system would have a 0.167 probability of selecting a C4 as the
next note.
The system generates several hundred possible series of
pitches for each rhythmic phrase. As with the rhythmic component, features are then extracted from these melodies using
jMusic and provided as inputs to the pitch evaluators. Generated melodies are only selected if they are classified positively
by both classifiers.

Chord Generator
The underlying harmony is determined using a Hidden
Markov Model, with pitches considered as observed events
and the chord progression as the underlying state sequence
(Rabiner, 1989). The Hidden Markov Model requires two
conditional probability distributions: the probability of a
melody note given a chord and the probability of a chord
given the previous chord. The statistics for these probability
distributions are gathered from the corpus of music representing the desired emotion.

For example, C4 is most likely to be accompanied by a C
major chord, and F4 is most likely to be accompanied by a
G7 chord in selections from the “love” corpus (probabilies of
0.099 and 0.061, respectively). In the “sadness” corpus, C4
is most likely to be accompanied by a C minor chord (probability of 0.060). As examples from the second set of distributions, the G7 chord is most likely to be followed by the
G7 or the C major chord in selections from the “love” corpus (both have a probability of 0.105). In selections from the
“sadness” corpus, the G7 chord is most likely to be followed
by the G7 or the C minor chord (probabilities of 0.274 and
0.094 respectively).
The system then calculates which set of chords is most
likely given the melody notes and the two conditional probability distributions. Since many of the songs in the training
corpora had only one chord present per measure, initial attempts at harmonization also make this assumption, considering only downbeats as observed events in the model.

Accompaniment and Instrumentation Planner
The accompaniment patterns for each of the selections in
the various corpora are categorized, and the accompaniment
pattern for a generated selection is probabilistically selected
from the patterns of the target corpus. Common accompaniment patterns included arpeggios, block chords sounding on
repeated rhythmic patterns, and a low base note followed by
chords on non-downbeats.
For example, arpeggios are a common accompaniment pattern in the corpus of selections expressing the emotion of
“love.” Two of the selections in the corpus feature simple,
arpeggiated chords as the predominant theme in their accompaniments, and two more selections have an accompaniment
pattern that feature arpeggiated chords played by one instrument and block chords played by a different instrument. The
remaining two selections in the corpus feature an accompaniment pattern of a low base note followed by chords on nondownbeats. When a new selection is generated by the system,
one of these three patterns is selected with equal likelihood to
be the accompaniment for the new selection.
Instruments for the melody and harmonic accompaniment
are also probabilistically selected based on the frequency
of various melody and harmony instruments in the corpus.
For example, melody instruments for selections in the “surprise” corpus include acoustic grand piano, electric piano,
and piccolo. Harmony instruments include trumpet, trombone, acoustic grand piano, and acoustic bass.

Evaluation
In order to verify that our system was accurately modeling characteristics contributing to emotional content, we presented our generated selections to research subjects and asked
them to identify the emotions present. Forty-eight subjects,
ages 18 to 55, participated in this study. Six selections were
generated in each category, and each selection was played
for four subjects. Subjects were given the list of emotions
and asked to circle all emotions that were represented in each

2358

song. Each selection was also played for four subjects who
had not seen the list of emotions. These subjects were asked
to write down any emotions they thought were present in the
music without any suggestions of emotional categories on the
part of the researchers. Reported results represent percentages of the twenty-four responses in each category. To provide a baseline, two members of the campus songwriting club
were also asked to perform the same task: compose a musical
selection representative of one of six given emotions. Each
composer provided selections for three of the emotional categories. These selections were evaluated in the same manner
as the computer-generated selections, with four subjects listening to each selection for each type of requested response.
Reported results represent percentages of the four responses
in each category.

Results
Figure 2 outlines the characteristics identified by the decision
trees as being responsible for emotional content. For example, if a piece had a Dissonance measure over 0.107 and a
Repeated Pitch Density measure over 0.188, it was classified
in the “anger” category. Informally, angry selections tend to
be dissonant and have many repeated notes. Similar information was collected for each of the different emotions. Selections expressing “love” tend to have lower repeated pitch
density and fewer repeated patterns of three, indicating these
selections tend to be more “flowing.” Joyful selections have
some stepwise movement in a major scale and tend to have a
strong climax at the end. The category of “surprise” appears
to be the least cohesive; it requires the most complex set of
rules for determining membership in the category. However,
repeated pitch patterns of four are present in all the surprising selections, as is a lack of stepwise movement in the major
scale. Not surprisingly, selections expressing “sadness” adhere to a minor scale and tend to have a downward trend in
pitch. Fearful selections deviate from the major scale, do not
always compensate for leaps, and have an upward pitch direction. Downward melodic trends do not deviate as much from
the major scale. Our model appears to be learning to detect
the melodic minor scale; melodies moving downward in this
scale will have a raised sixth and seventh tone, so they differ
in only one tone from a major scale.
Tables 1 and 2 report results for the constrained response
surveys. Row labels indicate the corpus used to generate a
given selection, and column labels indicate the emotion identified by survey respondents. Based on the results in Table 1,
our system is successful at modeling and generating music
with targeted emotional content. For all of the emotional categories but “surprise,” a majority of people identified the emotion when presented with a list of six emotions. In all cases,
the target emotion ranked highest or second highest in terms
of the percentage of survey respondents identifying that emotion as present in the computer-generated songs. As a general rule, people were more likely to select the categories of
“joy” or “sadness” than some of the other emotions, perhaps

ity” were also used to describe the selections.
Angry songs were often described using Parrott’s terms of
“annoyance” and “agitation.” Other words used to describe
angry songs included “uneasy,” “insistent,” and “grim.” Descriptions for songs in the “sad” category ranged from “pensive” and “antsy” to “deep abiding sorrow.” A few listeners
described a possible situation instead of an emotion: “being
somewhere I should not be” or “watching a dog get hit by a
car.” Fearful songs were described with words such as “tension,” “angst,” and “foreboding.” “Hopelessness” and even
“homesickness” were also mentioned.

because music in western culture is traditionally divided up
into categories of major and minor. A higher percentage of
people identified “joy” in songs designed to express “love”
or “surprise” than identified the target emotion. “Fear” was
also a commonly selected category. More people identified
angry songs as fearful, perhaps due to the sheer amount of
scary-movie soundtracks in existence. Themes from “Jaws,”
“Twilight Zone,” or “Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony” readily
come to mind as appropriate music to accompany frightening
situations; thinking of an iconic song in the “anger” category
is more of a challenging task. Averaging over all categories,
57.67% of respondents correctly identified the target emotion
in computer-generated songs, while only 33.33% of respondents did so for the human-generated songs.
For the open-ended questions, responses were evaluated by
similarity to Parrott’s expanded hierarchy of emotions. Each
of the six emotions can be broken down into a number of secondary emotions, which can in turn be subdivided into tertiary
emotions. If a word in the subject’s response matched any
form of one of these primary, secondary, or tertiary emotions,
it was categorized as the primary emotion of the set. Results
are reported in Tables 3 and 4. Again, row labels indicate the
corpus used to generate a given selection, and column labels
indicate the emotion identified by survey respondents.
The target emotion also ranked highest or second highest
in terms of the percentage of survey respondents identifying
that emotion as present in the computer-generated songs for
the open-ended response surveys. Without being prompted
or limited to specific categories, and with a rather conservative method of classifying subject response, listeners were
still often able to detect the original intended emotion. Once
again, the computer-generated songs appear to be slightly
more emotionally communicative. 21.67% of respondents
correctly identified the target emotion in computer-generated
songs in these open-ended surveys, while only 16.67% of respondents did so for human-generated songs.
Listeners cited “fondness,” “amorousness,” and in one
rather specific case, “unrequited love,” as emotions present
in selections from the “love” category. One listener said it
sounded like “I just beat the game.” Another mentioned “talking to Grandpa” as a situation the selection called to mind.
Reported descriptions of selections in the “joy” category most
closely matched Parrott’s terms. These included words such
as “happiness,” “triumph,” “excitement”, and “joviality.” Selections were also described as “adventurous” and “playful.”
None of the songs in the category of “surprise” were described using Parrott’s terms. However, this is not entirely
unexpected considering the fact that Parrott lists a single secondary emotion and three tertiary emotions for this category.
By comparison, the category of joy has six secondary emotions and 34 tertiary emotions. The general sentiment of
“surprise” still appears to be present in the responses. One
listener reported that the selection sounded like an ice cream
truck. Another said it sounded like being literally drunken
with happiness. “Playfulness,” “childishness,” and “curios-

Conclusion
Pearce, Meredith, and Wiggins (Pearce, Meredith, & Wiggins, 2002) suggest that music generation systems concerned
with the computational modeling of music cognition be evaluated both by their behavior during the composition process
and by the music they produce. Our system is able to successfully develop cognitive models and use these models to effectively generate music. Just as humans listen to and study the
works of previous composers before creating their own compositions, our system learns from its exposure to emotionlabeled musical data. Without being given a set of preprogrammed rules, the system is able to develop internal mod-

els of musical structure and characteristics that contribute to
emotional content. These models are used both to generate
musical selections and to evaluate them before they are output to the listener. The quality of these models is evidenced
by the system’s ability to produce songs with recognizable
emotional content. Results from both constrained and unconstrained surveys demonstrate that the system can accomplish
this task as effectively as human composers.
