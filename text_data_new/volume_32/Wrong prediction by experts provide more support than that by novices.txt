Wrong prediction by experts provide more support than that by
novices

Abstract: The current research explored whether lay people have a tendency to provide higher support for ”wrong”
predictions made by experts than those made by novices. Three empirical studies consistently revealed that there
indeed exists a preference for wrong predictions even when predictions are made by experts. In addition, the current
research also formulates preferences for wrong predictions made by experts in terms of a Bayesian inference and
expresses the processes by which one may believe the wrong prediction in the form of two factors—prior odds and
likelihood ratio. Finally, I argue that this preference is logical when treated as a result of the comparison between
the two competing hypotheses.
