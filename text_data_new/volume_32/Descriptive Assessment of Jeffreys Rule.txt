Abstract
(1)

Jeffrey (1983) proposed a generalization of conditioning as
a means of updating probability distributions when new evidence drives no event to certainty. His rule requires the stability of certain conditional probabilities through time. We tested
this assumption (“invariance”) from the psychological point of
view. In Experiment 1 participants offered probability estimates for events in Jeffrey’s candlelight example. Two further
scenarios were investigated in Experiment 2, one in which invariance seems justified, the other in which it does not. Results
were in rough conformity to Jeffrey (1983)’s principle.

Pr 2 (G) = Pr 2 (G|B)Pr 2 (B) + Pr 2 (G|B)Pr 2 (B).

If experience has not influenced the conditional probability
of G given B nor that of G given B then invariance is said to
hold (Jeffrey, 2004, §3.2). That is:
(2)

Pr 2 (G|B) = Pr 1 (G|B) and

Pr 2 (G|B) = Pr 1 (G|B).

Substituting (2) into (1) yields:

Introduction
Consider an idealized agent whose beliefs are represented by
a (subjective) probability distribution Pr 1 over an outcome
space S . Let B ⊆ S be such that Pr 1 (B) > 0 and suppose that
experience intervenes to convince the agent that B is certainly
true. What probability distribution Pr 2 should represent the
agent’s new state of belief? The Bayesian answer (Hacking,
2001, Ch. 15) identifies Pr 2 with the result of conditioning
Pr 1 on B, that is, Pr 2 (·) = Pr 1 (·|B). Much can be said in favor of the latter equation from the normative perspective. For
example, it follows from compelling axioms on belief change
(Gardenfors, 1988, §5.2), and its violation exposes the agent
to sure-loss betting contracts (Harman, 1999, §4.12). Updating has also been examined from the psychological perspective with focus on the use of Bayes’ Theorem to compute
conditional probability (see Stanovich (2010, Ch. 3)).
Conditioning is not always suited, however, to represent
the impact of new information. In particular, Jeffrey (1983,
§11.1) notes that the passage of experience need not raise the
probability of any event to one. He gives the example of examining cloth by faint candlelight. The cloth’s potential colors might correspond to different events over S but none may
become certain as a result of the examination. Nor is it feasible to augment S to include visual sensations, with the idea
of setting one of them to unity. Such sensations are too difficult to express and individuate. Instead, says Jeffrey, “the
best we can do is to describe, not the quality of the visual
experience itself, but rather its effects on the observer,” for
example, that the probability of blue has shifted to .75 from
its original value.
To fill in the rest of Pr 2 after experience has set the value
of Pr 2 (B), Jeffrey relies on the law of total probability. Let
G ⊆ S be given, and suppose that 0 < Pr 2 (B) < 1. Then:

Pr 2 (G) = Pr 1 (G|B)Pr 2 (B) + Pr 1 (G|B)Pr 2 (B).

(3) is known as “Jeffrey’s rule.” It shows how change in the
probability of B is propagated to G, without experience directly affecting G. It is straightforward to generalize (3) to
finer partitions, in place of the binary partition B, B.
Assuming invariance, it is easy to show that (3) defines a
genuine probability distribution Pr 2 , and in the special case
of Pr 2 (B) = 1, that it agrees with conditionalization. Moreover, Williams (1980) proves that Pr 2 as given by (3) is the
closest distribution to Pr 1 that yields the new probability of B,
where “closeness” is measured by cross-entropy with respect
to Pr 1 . The normative status of Jeffrey’s rule has nonetheless been questioned because successive uses produce distinct
distributions depending on the order in which events are considered (Doring, 1999). In our view, such doubts disappear
upon closer inspection of the evidential weight of probability
judgments (Wagner, 2002; Osherson, 2002).
It is important to observe that Invariance (2) is not normatively justified in every situation. Sometimes the conditional
probabilities are shifted by experience. For example, let G
represent vigorous growth of a potted plant, and let B represent the decision to place it in the bedroom. Then noticing
ample sunshine in the bedroom would increase not just the
probability of B but also the probability of G given B. In contrast, if all you notice is the absence of plants in the bedroom
then the probability of B increases without a change in the
probability of G given B, yielding invariance.
To decide whether invariance is warranted in a given situation, we rely on an observation due to Pearl (1988). Given an
experience e that intervenes between times 1 and 2, we expect
invariance to hold if at time 1, G is conditionally independent
of e given B, that is:

given B: Pr 1 (G | B, e) = Pr 1 (G | B).
To see that invariance depends on (4), observe that Pr 2 (GB) =
Pr 1 (GB, e) since e is what transpires between times 1 and 2,
and the latter term equals Pr 1 (GB) just in case (4) holds.
The focus of the present paper is whether invariance is descriptively accurate when mandated normatively. In Experiment 1 undergraduates offer probabilities for events in Jeffrey’s candle example. Of particular interest is the extent
to which invariance is honored. Two further scenarios are
then investigated, one in which invariance seems justified, the
other in which it does not. The results show modest deviations from invariance where it seems justified normatively.

Experiment 1
Participants
Ninety-six undergraduates from Princeton University participated in exchange for partial course credit (41 female, mean
age 19.4 yrs, SD = 1.0).

Materials
We simulated Jeffrey’s candle example by having participants
examine colored paper cards with a dim flashlight. There
were 12 blue cards and 38 purple cards. Each card was
marked with either a hippopotamus or a giraffe on one side.
Of the blue cards, eight were marked with a hippo and four
with a giraffe. Of the purple cards, 24 were marked with a
hippo and 14 with a giraffe. We chose giraffe and blue as the
categories G and B evoked in the Introduction. Table 1 summarizes the objective probabilities figuring in the experiment.

The estimates Pr (B|G) and Pr (B|G) served as a contrast with
Pr (G|B) and Pr (G|B). Given our procedure (see below), the
former estimates were not expected to be invariant across the
flashlight experience whereas the latter were.
The participant was then informed that s/he would briefly
see the card under dim light. The card would be placed face
down on the table so that the participant would not see the
animal but only the color of the card. The experimenter then
turned off the lights in the room, moved the card from her
pocket to the table, and flashed the light for about one second. The card was then returned to the experimenter’s pocket,
and the participant answered the same set of questions shown
above (in a different random order). Since participants had to
give their estimates twice to the same questions, we informed
them that they were free to provide the same estimate or a
different estimate the second time around.
In the control condition, the procedure was the same except
that the light was applied to the chosen card immediately after
its draw. Participants in the control condition thus answered
the questions shown above just once, after briefly seeing the
card under the dim light.

Results
Average responses. We separately analyzed results for participants exposed to blue cards (Blue group) and those exposed to purple cards (Purple group). In the experimental
condition we use Pr 1 to refer to probability estimates before
the light experience and Pr 2 for estimates after the experience. For each condition and each color group, we averaged
Pr 1 and Pr 2 estimates. The results are shown in Table 1.

Procedure
Sixty-four participants performed the experimental condition,
and 32 performed the control condition. The purpose of the
control condition was to assess the impact of being asked to
evaluate the same probabilities a second time. In the experimental condition, the experimenter first shuffled the cards
and showed each to the participant. Then the experimenter
turned away from the participant, drew one card from the
shuffled deck, and put it in her pocket. The draw appeared
to be random but in fact was guaranteed across participants
to deliver equal numbers of blue and purple cards (for statistical purposes). The participant was informed that the card
was randomly chosen, and then answered the following questions about the card, via computer interface (the order was
randomized for each participant):

Control vs. experimental conditions. As experimental
participants provided estimates twice to the same questions,
Pr 2 estimates were compared to those of control group.
Independent-sample t-tests for each of the six questions revealed no reliable differences between Pr 2 and the control
estimates. Thus, these participants seem not to have been influenced by having to evaluate the same probabilities twice.

Analysis of the Experimental Blue group. We report the
Experimental Blue and Experimental Purple participants separately, starting with Blue. As a manipulation check, we
first determined whether Pr (B) increased after participants
saw the blue card under dim light. As expected, Pr 2 (B)
was reliably larger than Pr 1 (B) [paired t(31) = 7.0, p < .01,
Wilcoxon p < .01].
To see whether invariance holds as described in (2), we
compared Pr 1 (G|B) to Pr 2 (G|B) via paired t-test and found
no reliable difference [df = 31, p > .05]. Of the 32 Blue
participants, 18 offered a different Pr 2 (G|B) estimate from
Pr 1 (G|B). For these 18 participants, the average signed difference between Pr 1 (G|B) and Pr 2 (G|B) is −0.02 which is
not reliably different from 0 [t(17) = 0.3, p > .05]. Pr 1 (G|B)
was likewise found to be close to Pr 2 (G|B) [paired t(31) =
1.3, p > .05]. Eighteen out of 32 participants gave a different
Pr 2 (G|B) estimate from Pr 1 (G|B). The average signed difference between Pr 1 (G|B) and Pr 2 (G|B) is −0.09 which is
reliably different from 0 [t(17) = 2.2, p < .05].
To more precisely quantify violation of invariance, for each
participant we calculated the absolute movement between
two estimates as a percentage of the original estimate, via:

for the quantities at the right of the equality. We will
call this value the total probability of G, or Pr total (G)
for short. Likewise, for each participant we computed
the value of Pr (G) via Jeffrey’s rule (3). We will call
this value the Jeffrey probability of G, or Pr Je f f (G) for
short. The latter estimates were compared to the participant’s direct evaluation of Pr 2 (G) via absolute difference:
(8)

error = Pr 2 (G) − Pr total (G)

The means for total and Jeffrey error were .07 and .10, respectively, not reliably different via paired t-test [t(31) = 1.7,
p > .05] or Wilcoxon test (p > .05).

Analysis of the Experimental Purple group. We first determined whether Pr (B) decreased after participants saw the
purple card under dim light. As expected, Pr 2 (B) was reliably less than Pr 1 (B) [paired t(31) = 5.6, p < .01, Wilcoxon
p < .01].
We compared Pr 1 (G|B) to Pr 2 (G|B) via paired t-test and
found no reliable difference [df = 31, p > .05]. Of the
32 Purple participants, 21 offered a different Pr 2 (G|B) estiPr 2 (G|B) − Pr 1 (G|B)

A majority of participants, in contrast, gave different estimates for Pr 2 (G|B) compared to Pr 1 (G|B) after gaining new
information about color via the light.
As a percentage of Pr 1 (G|B), the absolute difference between Pr 2 (G|B) and Pr 1 (G|B) was not trivial but nonetheless reliably smaller than the absolute percentage difference
for the converse probabilities Pr 2 (B|G) and Pr 1 (B|G). Normatively, invariance is not expected with respect to Pr (B|G).
When used to estimate Pr 2 (G) via the law of total probability, we saw that Pr 1 (G|B) could be substituted for Pr 2 (G|B)
with little loss of accuracy [total versus Jeffrey error, as in
(8)]. This provides another indication of the relative modesty
of invariance violations in Experiment 1.

L OTTERY PROBABILITY QUESTIONS :
Pr (C)
Pr (W )
Pr (C|W )
Pr (C|W )

The participant was then presented with the following additional information.
It’s the night of the lottery, and the numbers are being drawn.
Mr. X becomes excited because the first four draws are 32, 12,
24, and 17. In other words, the first four numbers drawn match
the numbers on his ticket.

Experiment 2
For another assessment of invariance, we asked a new group
of participants to estimate probabilities for events in two different scenarios. The lottery scenario was designed to justify
invariance whereas the ultimatum game scenario was not.

Participants
One hundred undergraduates from Princeton University participated in exchange for partial course credit (58 female,
mean age 19.5 yrs, SD = 1.1). None had served in Experiment 1.

Materials and procedure
Fifty participants served in the experimental condition, and
another 50 in the control condition. As in Experiment 1,
the purpose of the control condition was to assess the impact
of being asked to evaluate the same probabilities a second
time. Each participant in both conditions was presented with
the lottery and the ultimatum game scenarios (the order was
counterbalanced).
Lottery scenario. In this scenario we substitute C (buying
a car) for G and W (winning the lottery) for B. The following
description was presented on the computer screen for each
participant:
Imagine that a randomly chosen adult (call him Mr. X) in
New Jersey has just purchased the Jersey Cash 5 lottery for
this week. In this lottery, there are 5 numbers to be drawn,
each from 1 to 40. Each number is drawn from the bowl and
then put aside. The lottery jackpot is $240,000 which will be
shared by players who have all 5 winning numbers (the order
of the numbers doesn’t matter). The numbers on Mr. X’s lottery ticket are 12 17 24 32 39.

In the experimental condition, the participant answered the
following questions before the lottery numbers were drawn
(the order was randomized for each participant):

What’s the probability that Mr. X will buy a new
car in the next two years?
What’s the probability that Mr. X will win the
jackpot?
What’s the probability that Mr. X will buy a new
car in the next two years assuming that he wins the
jackpot?
What’s the probability that Mr. X will buy a new
car in the next two years assuming that he does
NOT win the jackpot?

The participant answered the same set of questions shown
above (in a different random order) before the last number
was drawn. Since participants had to give their estimates
twice to the same questions, we informed them that they were
free to provide the same estimate or a different estimate the
second time around. In the control condition, participants saw
the description of the lottery immediately followed by the results of the first four numbers, and then answered the questions shown above just once.
In the lottery scenario knowing the results of the first
four draws provides no further information about W once
it is granted that Mr. X wins the lottery. In other words,
Pr 2 (C|W ) = Pr 1 (C|W, f ) = Pr 1 (C|W ), where f is the experience of knowing the results of the first four draws. For this
reason, invariance seems justified.
Ultimatum game scenario. Here we use A (accepting the
offer) and O (offering at least $4) to replace G and B. The
following description was presented on the computer screen
for each participant:
Imagine that two undergraduate students are randomly chosen
from Princeton University to play a game. The game works
as follows. The two students are given the opportunity to split
$10. One student is the proposer and the other is the responder.
The proposer makes an offer as to how $10 should be split
between the two. The responder can either accept or reject this
offer. If the responder accepts the offer, the money is split as
proposed, but if the responder rejects the offer, then neither
of them receives anything. The students have just finished the
first trial of the game.

In the experimental condition, the participant was informed
that the two students were about to play the second trial. The
participant then answered the following questions (randomly
ordered) about the second trial prior to learning the outcome
of the first trial.

2533

U LTIMATUM GAME PROBABILITY QUESTIONS :
Pr (A)
Pr (O)
Pr (A|O)
Pr (A|O)

What’s the probability that the responder will accept the offer from the proposer in the second trial?
What’s the probability that the proposer will offer
AT LEAST $4 to the responder in the second trial?
What’s the probability that the responder will accept the offer assuming that the proposer offers AT
LEAST $4 in the second trial?
What’s the probability that the responder will accept the offer assuming that the proposer offers
LESS THAN $4 in the second trial?

The participant was then presented with the following additional information about the scenario:
Now you learn that in the first trial the responder rejected the
proposer’s offer and neither of them received anything. They
are about to play the second trial.

The participant answered the same set of questions shown
above (in a different random order) about the second trial of
the game. Again we informed participants that they were free
to provide the same estimate or a different estimate the second
time around. In the control condition, participants saw the
description of the ultimatum game immediately followed by
the outcome of the first trial, and then answered the questions
shown above just once.
In this scenario invariance is not normatively required because the outcome of the first trial suggests that the responder is sensitive to the fairness of offers. Thus, Pr 2 (A|O) =
Pr 1 (A|O,t) < Pr 1 (A|O), where t is the experience of knowing the outcome of the first trial.

Results
Average responses. In each scenario we use Pr 1 to refer to
probability estimates before the experience and Pr 2 for estimates after the experience. Average probabilities are shown
in Table 2.

the first four draws. As expected, Pr 2 (W ) was reliably larger
than Pr 1 (W ) [paired t(49) = 7.7, p < .01, Wilcoxon p < .01].
To see whether invariance holds, we compared Pr 1 (C|W )
to Pr 2 (C|W ) via paired t-test and found no reliable difference [df = 49, p > .05]. Of the 50 participants, only 12 offered different values for Pr 2 (C|W ) versus Pr 1 (C|W ). The
12 non-invariant participants made highly variable estimates,
with average signed difference of 0.15 between Pr 1 (C|W )
and Pr 2 (C|W ) (SD = .57), not reliably different from 0
[t(11) = 0.9, p > .05]. Pr 1 (C|W ) was likewise found to be
close to Pr 2 (C|W ) [paired t(49) = 1.0, p > .05]. Fifteen out
of 50 participants gave a different Pr 2 (C|W ) estimate from
Pr 1 (C|W ). For these 15, the average signed difference between Pr 1 (C|W ) and Pr 2 (C|W ) was 0.04 (SD = 0.12), again
not reliably different from 0 [t(14) = 1.0, p > .05]. The average invariance violation was only 1.42% with a median violation of 0. The mean invariance violation for Pr (C|W ) was
1.33% with a median of 0. Since we obtained no estimate for
Pr (W |C), converse movement was not computed.
From the results above, invariance seems to hold rather
well. For each participant, we therefore computed Pr total (C)
via (1) and Pr Je f f (C) via (3), with G and B substituted by
C and W . These estimates were compared to the participant’s direct evaluation of Pr 2 (C) via absolute difference.
The means for total and Jeffrey error were .15 and .13, respectively, not reliably different via paired t-test [t(49) = 1.5,
p > .05] or Wilcoxon test (p > .05).
Analysis of the ultimatum game scenario. We first determined whether Pr (O) increased after the reported rejection in
the preceding trial. As expected, Pr 2 (O) was reliably larger
than Pr 1 (O) [paired t(49) = 4.2, p < .01, Wilcoxon p < .01].
Of the 50 participants, 33 offered a different Pr 2 (A|O) estimate from Pr 1 (A|O). Thirty-eight out of 50 participants gave
a different Pr 2 (A|O) estimate from Pr 1 (A|O). The average invariance violation was 18.71% with a median of 12%. As expected, this violation was reliably greater than that in the lottery case (1.42%) [paired t(49) = 3.7, p < .01]. For Pr (A|O)
the mean invariance violation was 17.38%, reliably greater
than Pr (C|W ) in the lottery case (1.33%) [paired t(49) = 2.9,
p < .01]. Thus, invariance was violated to a greater extent
here than in the lottery scenario.

Discussion of Experiment 2

Control versus experimental conditions. We found no reliable differences between Pr 2 and the control estimates for
each scenario using independent-sample t-tests. Thus, experimental participants seem not to have been influenced by having to evaluate the same probabilities twice.

In the lottery scenario, invariance held for a majority of
participants, and the absolute difference between Pr 2 (C|W )
and Pr 1 (C|W ) as a percentage of Pr 1 (C|W ) was quite small.
When used to estimate Pr 2 (C) via the law of total probability, we saw that Pr 1 (C|W ) could be substituted for Pr 2 (C|W )
with little loss of accuracy. In the ultimatum scenario, however, a majority of participants gave different estimates for
Pr 2 (A|O) compared to Pr 1 (A|O) after learning the outcome
of the first trial. Thus, invariance seems not to hold for the
ultimatum scenario, as it ought not on normative grounds.1

Analysis of the lottery scenario. We first determined
whether Pr (W ) increased after participants saw the results of

with 330 participants recruited over the internet via Amazon Turk.

General Discussion
In Experiment 1, experience with the light changed the probability that the chosen card was blue, but had only mild impact on the probability of the giraffe given that the card was
blue. That is, Pr 2 (G|B) ≈ Pr 1 (G|B) as well as Pr 2 (G|B) ≈
Pr 1 (G|B). These results conform to Jeffrey (1983)’s invariance requirement for updating a distribution on the basis
of events whose probabilities are modified without reaching
certainty. As a result, the updated probability Pr 2 (G) was
equally well predicted from the law of total probability on
the basis of Pr 1 (G|B) and Pr 1 (G|B) versus Pr 2 (G|B) and
Pr 2 (G|B).
The invariance documented in Experiment 1 was selective inasmuch as greater movement was seen between the
converse probabilities Pr 1 (B|G) and Pr 2 (B|G) than between
Pr 1 (G|B) and Pr 2 (G|B). The difference in movement makes
normative sense because the giraffe is conditionally independent of the light given the color of the card whereas the color
of the card is not conditionally independent of the light given
the giraffe. Experiment 1 thus provides evidence that the
participants were sensitive to the normative appeal of Jeffrey’s rule, distinguishing (at least partially) between situations where it legitimately applies and where it does not.
The same conclusion is suggested by the results of Experiment 2. Only one of the two scenarios — involving the state
lottery rather than the Ultimatum game — gave grounds for
invariance, and participants honored the principle more in the
lottery context. In the latter setting, Pr 2 (C) (the revised probability of a car purchase) was predicted equally well from the
law of total probability based on Pr 1 (C|W ) and Pr 1 (C|W ), as
it was from Pr 2 (C|W ) and Pr 2 (C|W ).
Although the experiments support the hypothesis of (tacit)
respect for Jeffrey’s rule, the fact remains that a majority
of our participants (51 of 100) changed their estimate of
Pr (G|B) or Pr (C|W ) between times 1 and 2. A slightly
larger majority (54 of 100) did so for Pr (G|B) or Pr (C|W ).
[The events G(iraffe), B(lue), C(ar), and W (in) come from
the flashlight and lottery scenarios, where invariance is warranted.] In percentage terms, these shifts were sizeable in Experiment 1 (averaging around 47%) although much smaller
in Experiment 2 (less than 2%). The psychology of updating is incomplete without an explanation of why invariance
is not respected scrupulously in settings where it seems to be
required normatively.
The mere fact of evaluating the same probabilities twice
might explain some of the violation of invariance. The results of our control conditions, however, suggest that this effect was minor. Recall that control participants responded just
once, in the phase 2 setting (e.g., after the light), yet produced
estimates that were not reliably different from those gathered
in phase 2 of the experimental condition. Another source of
invariance violation might be illicit conversion of conditional
probability statements, e.g., evaluating Pr (B|G) in place of
the requested Pr (G|B). This explanation is consistent with
The results were in close agreement with those reported here.

studies that highlight such conversion (as in Dawes, Mirels,
Gold, and Donahue (1993)), but inconsistent with our own examination of conditional probability judgments (Zhao, Shah,
& Osherson, 2009) in which little conversion was observed.
Perhaps the variability of previous findings about conversion
is somehow connected to the difference between the flashlight
and lottery studies in their conformity to invariance.
A third possibility is that the flashlight procedure drew attention to the color dimension of the stimulus, reminding the
participant of its predictive value. This realization might have
been translated into more extreme conditional probabilities
(higher for blue, lower for purple). The less vivid experience
in the lottery scenario (merely being told about the first four
numbers) would have had less impact, explaining the difference between the two experiments. As an alternative to vivacity, the greater impact of the flashlight might be relateda
to the ineffable character of sensory impressions (as stressed
by Jeffrey (1983, §11.1)); there is no such difficulty for the
event of matching the first four lottery numbers. Of course,
more data are needed to test hypotheses such as these.
