Abstract
Many studies have examined the effects of co-activation of
similar words (“neighbors”) during processing, with some
reporting facilitative effects and others reporting inhibitory
effects. Attractor dynamics has provided a promising
integrated account in which distant semantic neighbors
(moderately similar words) tend to facilitate processing and
near semantic neighbors (highly similar words) tend to inhibit
processing. This framework was extended to phonological
neighbor effects on the accuracy of word production. For
aphasic patients (N=62) and speeded young controls (N=32),
picture naming was more accurate for words with many
distant phonological neighbors (words with matching onsets)
and less accurate for words with a near phonological neighbor
(homophones). In addition, the sizes of the facilitative and
inhibitory effects were correlated, suggesting that the
mechanisms responsible for both effects are functionally
integrated. These results extend an attractor dynamics
framework that predicts facilitative effects of distant
neighbors and inhibitory effects of near neighbors.
Keywords: phonological neighbors; cohort density;
homophones; neighborhood density; word production;
attractor dynamics.

Introduction
Theories of language processing agree that similar words
are co-activated during processing. Such co-activation
provides a simple account of classic priming effects:
processing cat partially activates dog (due to semantic
similarity) and can (due to form similarity), facilitating
responses to those words (Marslen-Wilson & Zwitserlood,
1989; Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971; Zwitserlood, 1996).
Co-activation is also consistent with findings from studies
using the visual-world paradigm: when instructed to click
on a picture of a cat, participants are more likely to fixate
images of a dog or a can (Allopenna, Magnuson, &
Tanenhaus, 1998; Huettig & Altmann, 2005; Magnuson,
Tanenhaus, Aslin, & Dahan, 2003; Mirman & Magnuson,
2009; Yee & Sedivy, 2006). Co-activation of similar words
has also been used to account for global similarity effects:
the number of similar words that are likely to be coactivated given a particular similarity metric, called
“neighborhood density”. In this report, we examine the
effects of two kinds of phonological neighbors on word
production in aphasic patients and speeded young controls.

The effects of neighborhood density on word processing
are complex and poorly understood. Neighbors defined by
form similarity (spelling or sound) have been found to
facilitate printed word recognition (e.g., Sears, Hino, &
Lupker, 1995) and spoken word production (e.g. Vitevitch,
2002). However, phonologically similar neighbors
consistently produce inhibitory effects in many tasks
involving spoken word recognition (e.g., Luce & Pisoni,
1998; Magnuson, Dixon, Tanenhaus, & Aslin, 2007).
Neighbors defined by semantic similarity can also exert
effects in both directions. Near neighbors (concepts with
very similar meanings) inhibit word recognition and distant
neighbors (concepts with moderately similar meanings)
facilitate visual word recognition (Mirman & Magnuson,
2008). Mirman and Magnuson suggested that this contrast
between the impact of near and distant neighbors on word
processing may be a general property of word processing.
For example, although orthographic neighbors (salt - halt)
generally facilitate visual word recognition, transposedletter neighbors (salt - slat) exert inhibitory effects
(Andrews, 1996).
The attractor dynamics framework for cognition
represents each concept as a stable state (“attractor basin” or
simply “attractor”) in a high-dimensional space of possible
mental states (for an accessible introduction see Spivey,
2007). Word processing is a matter of traversing this space
in order to reach the correct attractor. When the system has
reached a stable state, it is deemed to have “settled” and the
accuracy of the system’s final state can be compared relative
to the target attractor. Neighbors are other attractors and
distance between attractors is determined by similarity. The
critical insight from attractor dynamics is that different
similarity relations between neighbors can exert different
effects on the settling process (Mirman & Magnuson, 2008).
Distant neighbors create a broader attractor basin, which
facilitates settling to the correct attractor. In contrast, near
neighbors are too few to substantially change the overall
size of the attractor basin, but because of their high
similarity (i.e., proximity) to the target, they function as
conflicting subbasins, which slows the completion of the
settling process.
An alternative to the attractor dynamics account would be
to simply stipulate that neighbor effects are different in

1447

different contexts or tasks. For example, Vitevitch and Luce
(1998; 1999; see also Luce & Large, 2001) proposed that, in
speech perception, sub-lexical neighbor effects are
facilitative and lexical neighbor effects are inhibitory.
However, there are three arguments against this view as a
general account of neighborhood effects. First, the empirical
data have been challenged (Lipinski & Gupta, 2005).
Second, semantic neighbor effects appear to emerge at a
single level of processing (i.e., semantics), thus, assigning
different effects to different levels cannot account for the
facilitative effects of distant semantic neighbors and the
inhibitory effects of near semantic neighbors (Mirman &
Magnuson, 2008). Third, it is unparsimonious to propose
that neighbor interactions have fundamentally different
properties at different levels of processing.
Attractor dynamics provide a parsimonious, integrated
account in which neighbors can have different, contextdependent effects. However, the existing data have only
examined the key attractor dynamics prediction in the
domain of semantic neighborhoods. The present studies
examine these same predictions in the domain of
phonological neighbor effects on word production.
As noted above, previous studies have found facilitative
effects of phonological neighbors on word production.
Vitevitch (2002) found that healthy young controls
produced more errors in an error-elicitation paradigm and
were slower to name pictures for words with few
phonological neighbors compared to words with many
phonological neighbors. Similarly, aphasic patients produce
more errors when naming pictures with low phonological
neighborhood density names (Gordon, 2002; Kittredge,
Dell, Verkuilen, & Schwartz, 2008).
Given the facilitative effect of phonological neighbors in
picture naming tasks, one might expect that greater
phonological similarity would strengthen this effect. In the
extreme case, words with different meanings but identical
phonological forms, that is, homophones (e.g. can
[container] vs. can [able]) might be particularly easy. After
all, the naming target’s homophone is maximally
phonologically similar to target’s phonology. However, if
both meanings are activated during an attempt to retrieve
the name of one meaning of a homophone, those meanings
may compete, consequently producing slower responses and
higher error rates. Thus, there is reason to expect the
opposite result. Indeed, this is the critical prediction from
the attractor dynamics account of neighborhood effects.
There is an extensive experimental literature investigating
homophony in word production, most of which is concerned
with whether word frequency effects on picture naming
arise
from
syntactic-semantic
representations
or
phonological form representations (e.g. Caramazza, Costa,
Miozzo, & Bi, 2001; Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994). Although
there is no consensus among these studies, it is likely that
production latencies for a homophone are influenced by the
frequency of both its meaning and its form. More relevant to

our analysis are findings that both meanings of a
homophone are activated during word production. For
example, priming the non-pictured homophone meaning
affects response latency and accuracy in picture naming
tasks (Cutting & Ferreira 1999; Ferreira & Griffin, 2003).
Moreover, picture naming studies with aphasic patients have
shown that training on one homophone meaning generalizes
to the other meaning (Biedermann, Blanken, & Nickels,
2002; Biedermann & Nickels, 2008a; Biedermann &
Nickels, 2008b).
These studies suggest that homophone production
involves some degree of interaction between the target and
its homophone mate. Given this, if homophones are viewed
as very near phonological neighbors, the attractor dynamic
approach of Mirman and Magnuson (2008) predicts that
having a homophone should be associated with some kind
of cost. Alternately, if the extreme similarity of the
homophone just exaggerates the positive effect of having a
similar neighbor, then the expectation is for a benefit. These
conflicting predictions were tested by examining the
accuracy of picture naming in aphasic patients and in
speeded young controls.

Experiment
Methods
Participants. There were two sets of participants: aphasic
patients and speeded young controls. The patients were 62
unselected aphasic patients recruited from the MRRI
Cognitive Rehabilitation Research Registry (Schwartz,
Brecher, White, & Klein, 2005) on the basis of chronic
aphasia secondary to left cerebral vascular accident. They
had a mean age of 58 (range 26–78), mean years of
education of 14 (10–21), and most (over 90%) were at least
6 months post-onset. The patients were all premorbidly
right-handed, had English as the primary language, adequate
vision and hearing, and uniliateral left hemisphere damage
(not restricted to subcortical areas). These patients included
all aphasia subtypes and covered a wide range of
performance (2%-97% correct naming). The young controls
were 32 healthy college students with no known history of
neurological, visual, or auditory impairments, who were
recruited from the University of Illinois participant pool.
Materials. The 175-item Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT;
Roach et al., 1996) was used to measure word production in
picture naming. The black and white pictures represent
objects from varied semantic categories and have high
familiarity, name agreement, and image quality. Names
range in length from 1 to 4 syllables and in frequency
(normalized to occurrences per 1 million word tokens) from
1 to 100.
Our concern is with the effects of “near” and “distant”
phonological neighbors on picture naming in order to test

1448

the general attractor dynamics prediction that the effect of
neighbors will depend on their impact on the attractor
landscape. Distant phonological neighbors were defined as
words that share onsets with the target word. These words
are described as “cohorts” because they form the cohort of
partially activated words during spoken word recognition
(e.g., Allopenna et al., 1998; Magnuson et al., 2007;
Marslen-Wilson & Zwitserlood, 1989). There are many
possible phonological neighborhood measures, which are all
strongly correlated with one another. The cohort density
measure (the summed log frequency of the target word and
all of its cohorts) was chosen because word onsets are
particularly important for spoken word processing.
Lexical variables (phonological neighborhood, word
frequency, etc.) were assessed using the American National
Corpus (Ide & Suderman, 2004), a large-scale,
representative corpus of American English containing over
3.2 million spoken word tokens. The words in the PNT were
divided into “few” and “many” neighbor conditions based
on the median cohort density (31.5) and a few words were
eliminated to ensure that the conditions had an equal
number of words and were matched in word frequency and
length (the resulting conditions were composed of 85 words
each). Table 1 shows that the two conditions were matched
in word frequency and length and strongly different in
cohort density as well as differing on other phonological
neighborhood measures. For the purpose of this experiment,
it was not necessary to isolate a particular measure of
phonological neighborhood; rather, it was sufficient that
words in the two conditions strongly differed in their
number of phonologically similar words.

Procedure. The patients were tested using the standard
PNT
procedure
(http://www.ncrrn.org/assessment/pnt;
Roach et al., 1996; see also Dell et al., 1997; Schwartz et al.,
2006): each picture was presented one at a time and the first
complete (i.e. non-fragment) response produced within 20 s
was scored. The young controls were tested using the tempo
picture naming procedure (Hodgson & Lambon Ralph,
2008). This task provides a valuable source of converging
data for comparison with the patient data because it has
been shown to induce some characteristic aspects of aphasic
picture naming errors. In the tempo picture naming task,
participants heard a series of beeps set to a tempo (500 ms).
On the fourth beep they were also presented with a picture
(one of the PNT items), which they were to name and to
time their response to coincide with the fifth beep.

Results

Near phonological neighbors were defined as words with
identical phonological forms and unrelated meanings, that
is, homophones. The 175 words in the PNT include 14
homophones for which the pictured meaning is the
dominant meaning (meaning dominance was assessed based

Cohort Density. The left panel of Figure 1 shows that
picture naming accuracy was lower for low cohort density
words than for high cohort density words (Patients: 66.7%
vs. 70.4%, t(61)=5.5, p<0.00001; Speeded controls: 79.7%
vs. 81.7%, t(31)=2.37, p<0.05). Patients also produced more
nonword errors for low cohort density words than high
cohort density words (8.24% vs. 6.62%, t(61)=3.23,
p<0.01). Speeded controls produced very few nonword

errors (M=0.68%, SD=0.89%) and the numerical trend in
the same direction as the patients (0.77% vs. 0.63%) was
not significant (t(31)=0.49, p>0.6).
There were no
significant effects on any other error type. The cohort
density finding is consistent with previous findings that
words with many phonologically similar words are easier to
produce (Gordon, 2002; Kittredge et al., 2008; Vitevitch,
2002).

density words (left panel) and for homophones and control
words (right panel). Error bars reflect 1SE.
Homophony. The right panel of Figure 1 shows that
participants were more accurate for the control words than
for the homophones (Patients: 77.0% vs 71.7%, t(61)=3.45,
p<0.001; Speeded controls: 83.5% vs. 79.4%, t(31)=5.43,
p<0.00001). This finding is consistent with previous results
that indicate slowed processing due to competition between
different meanings of homophones (e.g., Shatzman &
Schiller, 2004; see also Ferreira & Griffin, 2003). The
increased errors for homophones did not aggregate to a
specific error type (i.e., no reliable differences for any error
type).
Relation between effect sizes. We tested the correlation
between cohort density and homophony effect sizes across
participants to examine whether there is a possible
relationship between them. Figure 2 shows each
participant’s homophony effect size (homophones – control)
plotted against that participant’s cohort density effect size
(high – low). The effect sizes were reliably correlated for
patients (r = -0.25, p<0.05) and for speeded controls (r = 0.76, p<0.0001).
One possible explanation for this effect size correlation is
that there is simply an effect of overall accuracy. That is,
participants who make more errors show bigger differences
between any conditions. To test this hypothesis, we
examined correlations between overall accuracy for the
critical conditions and the effect size. For patients, neither
correlation approached significance (homophony: r =
0.0032, p > 0.98; cohort density: r = 0.0937, p > 0.46). The

same was true for controls (homophony: r = 0.1124, p >
0.54; cohort density: r = -0.2616, p > 0.14). Since it is not
due to overall accuracy, the correlation between cohort
density and homophony effect sizes suggests that the
mechanisms involved in producing the benefit of similarsounding words (cohort density effect) are closely tied to
those involved in producing the cost of identical-sounding
words (homophony effect).

density effect sizes. Open circles correspond to patients,

General Discussion
We examined the effects of phonological neighbors on
picture naming in aphasic patients and speeded young
controls. Two kinds of phonological neighbors were
considered: similar-sounding words defined as words with
matching onsets (i.e., cohorts) and identical-sounding words
(i.e., homophones). These different phonological neighbor
types capture the important distinction between distant and
near neighbors. Mirman and Magnuson (2008) found that
distant semantic neighbors facilitated word recognition and
near semantic neighbors inhibited word recognition.
Andrews (1996) found a similar contrast between the effects
of (distant) orthographic neighbors and (near) transposedletter neighbors on visual word recognition. Based on these
results, we predicted facilitative effects of phonological
neighbors and inhibitory effects of homophony.
The results were consistent with these predictions: both
participant groups exhibited a facilitative effect of cohort
density and an inhibitory effect of homophony. In addition,
the effect sizes were correlated across participants; that is,
participants who showed larger cohort density advantage
effects also showed larger homophony disadvantage effects.
This suggests that the mechanism or mechanisms that
produce these effects are functionally integrated.
To account for the contrasting effects of near and distant
semantic neighbors, Mirman and Magnuson (2008)
proposed an account based on attractor dynamics. On this
view, distant neighbors create a broader attractor basin,

1450

which facilitates settling to the correct attractor. In contrast,
near neighbors are too few to substantially change the
overall size of the attractor basin, but because of their high
similarity (i.e., proximity) to the target, they function as
conflicting subbasins, which slows the completion of the
settling process. These distinctions are shown schematically
in Figure 3. Mirman and Magnuson confirmed this account
using simulations of a computational model.

response) or may settle to an incorrect attractor (error).
Since settling is facilitated by distant (cohort) neighbors and
inhibited by near (homophone) neighbors, this account
captures the observed pattern of facilitative effects of cohort
density and inhibitory effects of homophony. The
correlation between effect sizes could reflect the average
sharpness of attractor basins in the landscape. In a landscape
with relatively sharp attractor basins, distant neighbor
attractors would have a relatively small impact on slope
steepness and near neighbors would be less likely to act as a
competing subbasin. Attractor dynamic models generally
develop sharper attractors over the course of learning, so
this individual difference variable could reflect language
skill. Further research is required to test this hypothesis or
other possible explanations of the correlation between effect
sizes.
In sum, the present results demonstrate contrasting effects
of near and distant phonological neighbors on picture
naming and provide a new perspective on the mechanisms
involved in word production. Furthermore, they contribute
to the creation of a unified theory of neighborhood effects in
lexical processing.

To extend this framework to word production it is helpful
to consider picture naming as a process of settling to an
attractor in a multidimensional space that combines
semantic and phonological dimensions. For a given target
word, cohort neighbors and homophone neighbors are
equally semantically unrelated to the target (the cohort pair
can – cat and the homophone pair can [container] – can
[able] are equally semantically unrelated). On the
phonological dimensions, the homophone neighbors have
substantially more similarity to the target word than cohort
neighbors do (i.e., complete phonological overlap vs. shared
onsets). Therefore, a large number of cohort neighbors can
increase the gradient and facilitate settling to the correct
attractor. In contrast, a single homophone neighbor will not
have a substantial impact on the gradient, but can form a
competing subbasin, which can delay the settling process.
If the settling process is disrupted by damage or a time
constraint, the system may fail to settle completely (no
