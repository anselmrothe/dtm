Abstract: Two experiments with adult native users of Turkish and English speaking controls examined cognitive
repercussions of obligatory grammatical marking in Turkish of directly vs. indirectly experienced events. Exp. 1
examined recall accuracy of Turkish sentences containing direct vs. indirect past tense suffix markers; equivalent
sentences in English contained lexical marking of indirectness (e.g., ”reportedly”). Exp. 2 examined incidental
recognition memory for sentences containing direct vs. indirect experience markers. Performance in Exp. 1 was
uniformly low, indicating a floor effect in sentence information recall. Exp. 2 showed significantly better recognition
memory for sentences containing the direct marker vs. the indirect marker in Turkish; no such advantage was
observed in English. The findings suggest that obligatory marking of directly experienced events has a privileged
status in mental representation.
