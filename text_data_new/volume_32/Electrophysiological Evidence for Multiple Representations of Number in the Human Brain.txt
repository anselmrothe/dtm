Abstract
In adult human brains, the horizontal segment of the
intraparietal sulcus plays a large role in representing numeric
magnitude. In children and non-human primates, however,
frontal cortex may play a larger role. We hypothesized that
there is a link between observed developmental changes in
locus of representation (frontal to parietal) and type of
representation used (logarithmic to linear). Participants were
presented with number lines and asked to judge accuracy of
linear, logarithmic, or log-linear placements. Consistent with
hypotheses, event-related potentials generally revealed
greatest parietal N1 amplitudes for linear placements and
greatest frontal P3 amplitude for logarithmic placements.
Additionally, effects of linear placements on cortical activity
were moderated by numerical magnitude: parietal N1
amplitudes decreased with magnitude, whereas frontal P3
amplitudes increased with magnitude. These results suggest
adults possess logarithmic and linear representations of
number, and when logarithmic representations were elicited;
there was greater involvement of frontal cortex.

Introduction
Whether a pollster evaluating the sampling process for an
election poll, a parishioner telling the time by counting the
tolls of a church bell, or a child figuring out how much
candy she had received on this Halloween versus a previous
one, mental representations of numerical magnitude are
important for projecting the future, monitoring the present,
and learning from the past. Moreover, this ability to code
our experiences numerically must scale consistently
regardless of the shape, size, sensory modality or context in
which particular numeric magnitudes are presented.
Two prominent brain areas have been implicated in
humans’ and other animals’ representation of numerical
magnitudes: the prefrontal cortex and the horizontal
segment of the intraparietal Sulcus (HIPS). Most studies
have shown that HIPS plays a major role in numeric
representation, with magnitude coded in this area as an
abstract, notation-independent representation (Dehaene,

Piazza, Pinel, Cohen, 2003; Dehaene, Dehaene-Lambertz, &
Cohen, 1998; Libertus, Woldroff & Brannon, 2007).
However, comparative and developmental studies have
found HIPS playing a less prominent role. For example,
single cell recordings in monkeys (Nieder & Merten, 2007
& Nieder & Miller, 2004) and fMRI studies in children
(Ansari et al. 2005; Ansari & Dhital, 2006; Cantlon,
Brannon, Carter & Pelphrey, 2006; Cantlon et al., 2009)
have shown stronger effects of numerical magnitude on
prefrontal cortex than HIPS. Similarly, ERP studies with
infants, have also found that nonsymbolic numeric
processing generates activity in a parieto-prefrontal network
(Izard, Dehaene-Lambertz & Dehaene, 2008; Libertus,
Pruitt, Woldorff & Brannon, 2009).
To explain this developmental trend, we propose that: (1)
at any given age, the brain represents numeric magnitudes
using both a logarithmically-compressed code and a linear
code, with the probability of a number being processed by
the linear code increasing with age and experience; and (2)
logarithmic-coding is predominantly processed in frontal
areas, whereas linear coding is predominantly processed in
parietal areas. Here we test an implication of this account,
namely that large magnitude (low-frequency) numerals are
more likely than small magnitude (high-frequency)
numerals to be represented in frontal cortex, whereas the
reverse is true of parietal cortex.

Development of Numeric Representations
The origin of our developmental hypothesis stems from
behavioral studies on development of numeric
representations (Booth & Siegler, 2006; Opfer & Siegler,
2007; Opfer & Thompson, 2008; Siegler & Opfer, 2003;
Thompson & Opfer, 2008). In these studies, children and
adults were asked to estimate the position of numbers on a
blank line with the end-points labeled “0” and “100”, “0”
and “1000”, or “0” and “10000”. This estimation task is
particularly revealing about cognitive representations of
numeric value because it transparently reflects the ratio
characteristics of the number system. Overall, younger
children’s estimates typically follow Fechner’s Law and

1234

increase logarithmically with actual value, whereas older
children’s estimates increase linearly. At any given age,
however, individual children use both logarithmic and linear
representations of number, depending on numerical context.
That is, for very large numeric contexts (e.g., on 0-1000 and
0-10000 number lines), children’s estimates increase
logarithmically; however, the same children will use linear
representations when estimating the magnitudes of numbers
for small numeric contexts (e.g., on 0-100 number lines). If
our developmental hypothesis is correct, it should be
possible to identify two different patterns in the brain that
are consistent with the type of representation used, thereby
providing neural correlates for the logarithmic-to-linear shift
hypothesis.
Plausible candidates for these two different patterns of
neural activation are provided by the developmental data
showing a shift from prefrontal to parietal processing of
numerical magnitude (Cantlon, et al., 2009; Rivera, Reiss,
Eckert and Menon, 2005). More generally, evidence from
perceptual learning has shown that complex conjunctive
stimuli are processed by more posterior sites with gains in
expertise, both within the visual cortex (Mukai et al., 2007)
and between the prefrontal cortex and visual cortex
(Eriksson, Larsson, Nyberg, 2008). As a result, information
changes from being processed serially and with effort, to
being processed in parallel and automatically. Possibly, the
same is true for number representation, with the abstract
representation that is needed for processing numeric
magnitude regardless of shape, size, modality or context
originally coming from the prefrontal cortex and gradually
shifting to HIPS with gains in expertise.

Present Study
To test our hypothesis, we asked participants to judge
whether a number had been accurately marked on a number
line, and we evaluated the Event-Related Potentials (ERP)
generated after participants saw number-line estimates that
corresponded or not to a given numeral. By evaluating ERP
components related to numeric estimation, we were able to
test several predictions derived from our developmental
hypothesis. Specifically, we were able to provide a novel
test of whether subjects expected positions of numbers on
number lines to increase linearly, logarithmically, both, or
neither with numeric value, and we were able to test if the
topography of those ERP components corresponded to our
hypotheses.
Some ERP components can generate diagnostic data
about representations of numerical magnitude, even before
the subjects’ response. Generally, targets that violate
subjects’ expectations elicit large P3 amplitudes (Donchin,
1981). Thus, numbers marked in non-linear positions would
likely generate a higher P3 response than numbers marked
in the linear position. Conversely, the N1 component is
generally elicited when targets match the subject’s
orientation of attention (Luck, 2005; Folstein & Van Petten,
2008). Thus, numbers marked in the linear position would
be expected to generate higher N1 responses than numbers

marked in the non-linear position. Using this logic, ERP
components are capable of early detection of both linear and
non-linear representations of number. This provides an
important test of our hypothesis because automatic, nonlinear representations of number might occur in adults
before they have time to provide formally correct, learned
responses.

Method
Participants
Participants (N = 21, mean age = 20.5, 8 female) were
recruited from an introductory psychology class and were
awarded course credit for their participation in the
experiment. Nineteen participants were right handed, and all
had normal or corrected to normal vision.

Design and Procedure
Each problem presented a blank number line with a width of
255 pixels, labeled with ‘0’ on the left end and ‘1000’ on the
right end. The numbers presented appeared on the top of the
screen 192 pixels over the line (half point between the top of
the screen and the number line). The numbers tested were 5,
78, 150, 606, 725 and 938. These numerosities were
selected because they sample the whole length of the line
and also maximize the discriminability between linear and
logarithmic representations. All stimuli were presented in a
dark and sound-attenuated room using DirecRT (Jarvis,
2006).
Participants were instructed to identify if the position of
the hatch mark on a number line corresponded to the
numeral presented by pressing one key if the position of the
hatch mark were correct, and by pressing another if the
position of the hatch mark were incorrect (keys were
counterbalanced between participants).
At the beginning of each trial, the number line with the
marked end points appeared and a fixation was placed
where the target numerals were going to be shown for a
period of 1 second. Next, the stimulus (i.e. the numeral)
replaced the fixation for another 1-second interval. After
this period, the hatch mark was placed either in the linear,
logarithmic or log-linear position. Once the hatch mark was
in place, participants had to decide if the mark was correctly
placed and to press the appropriate key (no time limit was
imposed on participants’ responses). After the response, no
feedback was provided and a 2000-ms intertrial stimulus
interval (ISI) was used.
Participants were tested on three different sets of trials
and the design of the study was all within subjects. Thus, on
each block, participants encountered each of the six
numerals compared to three possible hatch mark positions
(linear, logarithmic, log-linear). The experiment consisted of
16 blocks and presentation of the trials was randomized
within each block. This corresponds to a total of 288 trials
(96 per trial type condition).

1235

ERP Recording Procedure After attaining informed
consent from participants, a NuAmps quick cap with 32
Ag/AgCl electrodes (Compumedics Neuroscan, El Paso,
TX, USA) was placed on their heads to record their brain
activity. Linked ears served as reference during recording.
Before the beginning of the experiment, impedances were
held below 40 kΩ1. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was
amplified with an A/D conversion rate of 1000 and a gain of
250mV. Finally, a recording low-pass filter of 300Hz was
used.
Before analysis of the data, the raw EEG data were
processed offline using BESA (Version 5.2). Raw data were
re-referenced to an average of all electrodes and a digital 0.1
to 30Hz bandpass filter was used. Also, artifact correction
(Berg & Scherg, 1994) was used to reduce ocular artifacts
and blinks. After artifact correction, an artifact rejection
procedure (tailored to each individual) was conducted. After
this process, 7 participants – who had less than 85% of the
trials accepted – were removed from further analyses. ERP
epochs (-200ms to 1000ms) were created for the three trial
types (i.e. linear, logarithmic and log-linear), and for hatch
mark number size (i.e. hatch marks that corresponded to
small numbers and large numbers).

+ 1)/(total trials + 2), and false alarm rates were constructed
by the formula (false alarms + 1)/(total trials + 2).
As predicted by the size effect, discriminability between
the linear, and the logarithmic and log-linear trials declined
with numeric size (see Figure 1). This result was confirmed
by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA (F(5,100) =
36.83, p < .001, ω2 = 0.59). An alternative explanation of
this result is that it is due to the distance between the linear
and logarithmic trials not being constant throughout the
whole range of numbers. Thus, it is possible that the reason
why discrimination decreases for the numbers 725 and 938
is because the distances between the linear and logarithmic
trials decrease too. To test this alternative hypothesis, we
performed a planned comparison between two numbers that
differ in size but that have the same distance between the
linear and logarithmic hatch mark positions (5 and 725). As
predicted by the size effect, even though the distance
between the linear and logarithmic trials is equal for these
two numbers, discriminability was significantly smaller for
725 (d’ = 2.25, SD = 0.78) than for 5(d’ = 3.04, SD = 0.56; p
< .001).

Results
Behavioral Results
Number comparison is typically characterized by effects of
distance and size on speed and accuracy of judgments
(Moyer & Landauer, 1967). We obtained similar results for
judgments of number line placements. Consistent with
distance effects, log-linear trials, which were closer to the
correct (linear) placements than logarithmic ones, required
more time to solve and resulted in the lowest accuracy rates.
Consistent with size effects, judging the location of large
numbers (i.e. larger than 500) on the number line required
more time than judging the location of small numbers (i.e.
smaller than 500), with accuracy also being lower for
placement of large numbers compared to small numbers.
Finally, there was evidence of interactive effects of size and
trial type, with larger effects of trial type for small numbers
(ω2 = .54) than for large numbers (ω2 = .32) on reaction
times. This interaction is interesting because it suggests that
representations of small numeric magnitudes are more
strongly linear and non-logarithmic than representations of
large numeric magnitudes, leading to less discriminability
between trial types for the large magnitudes.
A potential problem with accuracy measures, such as
those reported above is that they can fail to detect
systematic response biases. To address this issue, we
conducted d’ analyses. Because performance of participants
was near ceiling, hits and false alarm rates were corrected.
Specifically, hit rates were constructed by the formula (hits

Although the impedance threshold for accepting a participant
was 40 kΩ, in reality most of the electrodes achieved impedances
of 10 to 15 kΩ.

Electrophysiological Results
To understand the temporal characterization of the number
line estimation task, average waveforms were computed for
the three experimental trials (i.e. linear, logarithmic, loglinear). Additionally, these waveforms were averaged into
four different electrode sites with the purpose of reducing
experiment-wise error caused by computing multiple
statistical comparisons. The frontal left (FL) electrode site
was computed by averaging the electrodes FP1, F3, F7,
FC3, and FC7. The frontal right (FR) electrode site was
computed by averaging the electrodes FP2, F4, F8, FC4,
FC8. The parietal left (PL) electrode site was computed by
averaging the electrodes CP3, TP7, P3, P7. The parietal
right (PR) electrode site was computed by averaging the
electrodes CP4, TP8, P4, P8.

(right). Bottom: N1 (140-240 ms) and P3 (260-700 ms) ERP components for linear, logarithmic, and log-linear trials for
parietal (left) and frontal (right) electrode sites.
Visual inspection of the waveforms is consistent with the
main hypothesis from the study (see Figure 2). First, linear
trials generated a greater N1 peak than both the logarithmic
and log-linear trials, especially in parietal electrode sites.
Moreover, at frontal electrode sites, the logarithmic trials
generated a greater P3 peak than the log-linear trials, and in
turn, the log-linear trials generated a greater P3 peak than
the linear trials. These effects suggest that even before the
behavioral response is effectuated, there is a strong
recognition of the linear placements of numbers followed by
a signal of surprise related to the logarithmic and log-linear
placements of numbers.
To test these effects statistically, a 3-way (trial type:
linear, logarithmic, log-linear x electrode site: FL, FR, PL,
PR x component: N1, P3) repeated-measures ANOVA was
conducted on the mean amplitudes calculated for the N1 and
P3 time windows. All reported p-values are GreenhouseGeisser corrected for violations of sphericity assumptions.
Results indicated a significant component x electrode
interaction, (F(3,39) = 8.37, p < .001, η2 = 0.39). This effect
is largely due to a larger N1 component in parietal sites
compared to frontal sites. Furthermore, as expected, a trial
type x electrode x component interaction was significant
(F(6,78) = 3.85, p = .033, η2 = 0.23). This interaction was
due to different simple main effects of trial type at the N1
component for the PL (F(2,26) = 8.07, p = .003, ω2 = 0.25)
and PR (F(2,26) = 14.81, p < .001, ω 2 = 0.40) electrode
sites versus simple main effects of trial type at the P3
component for the FR (F(2,26) = 4.69, p = .048, ω 2 = 0.16)
and PL (F(2,26) = 18.25, p < .001, ω 2 = 0.45) electrode
sites.
To explore this more closely, we computed average
waveforms for the correct linear trials with hatch marks that
corresponded to small numbers (i.e. 5, 78, 150) and to large
numbers (i.e. 606, 725, 938). As can be seen in Figure 3,

compared to small numbers, large numbers generated
smaller N1 peaks at parietal electrode sites and larger P3
peaks at frontal electrode sites. This pattern of results
indicates that small numbers were expected to appear in the
linear position, whereas large numbers were not. Thus, even
though participants made the correct response for both types
of numbers, the brain shows evidence that large numbers
and small numbers are processed differently.
To test these results statistically, we conducted a 3-way
(Condition: small numbers, large numbers x Electrode: FL,
FR, PL, PR x Component: N1, P3) repeated measures
ANOVA. Results showed a significant electrode x
component interaction (F(3,39) = 9.14, p < .001, η2 = 0.41).
This effect is largely due to a change in polarity from the N1
to the P3 components in parietal electrodes. Moreover, as
expected there was a significant trial condition x electrode x
component interaction (F(3,39) = 8.05, p < .001, η2 = 0.38).
Post-hoc analysis revealed that when hatch marks were
positioned linearly, a greater N1 component at the PR
electrode site (F(1,13) = 5.67, p = .033, ω2 = 0.14) was
elicited by small numbers than by large numbers. Also, at
the FL electrode site, linearly positioned hatch marks
elicited a greater P3 component (F(1,13) = 6.31, p = .026,
ω2 = 0.16) for large numbers than for small numbers.

DISCUSSION
We aimed to provide a temporal characterization of brain
activity evoked by representations of numeric magnitudes.
This characterization supported two conclusions: (1) the
adult brain continues to represent numeric magnitudes using
both a logarithmically-compressed code and a linear code,
with the probability of a number being processed by the
linear code decreasing with numeric magnitude (and thus
frequency and prior experience); and (2) that logarithmiccoding is predominantly processed in frontal areas, whereas

(left) and at 300 ms (right). Bottom: N1 (140-240 ms) and P3 (260-700 ms) ERP components for correct linear trials divided
into small and large numbers for parietal (left) and frontal (right) electrode sites
linear coding is predominantly processed in parietal areas.
These findings are important because they are consistent
with our proposed explanation for a key finding in the
developmental neuroscience of number representation.
Namely, that although it has been found that HIPS is crucial
for numeric processing (Dehaene, et al., 2003), studies that
test children, have found a greater involvement of the
prefrontal cortex (Ansari et al. 2005; Ansari & Dhital, 2006;
Cantlon, et al., 2006; Cantlon, et al., 2009; Rivera, Reiss,
Eckert and Menon, 2005).
Evidence supporting our first conclusion comes from
several findings from this study. Behavioral results indicate
that both linear and non-linear positions of numbers were
judged as correct, with probability of non-linear positions
being judged as correct increasing as numbers increased in
size. Electrophysiological results were consistent with this
behavioral finding. Small numbers shown in the linear
position generated a greater N1 peak than did large numbers
shown in the linear position. Similarly, large numbers
shown in the linear position generated a greater P3 peak
than
did
smaller
numbers.
Moreover,
these
electrophysiological findings held even when subjects’
behavior correctly identified locations as linear. Thus,
neither behavioral nor electrophysiological results are
consistent with the idea that numbers are solely represented
linearly or solely non-linearly.
Evidence supporting our second conclusion comes solely
from electrophysiological data. As indicated by the N1
component, smaller numbers were more easily identified
than large numbers, and this identification was
predominantly found in parietal sites (Dehaene, 1996;
Libertus et al., 2007). On the other hand, linear trials that
corresponded to larger numbers (that are less entrenched)
generated a greater surprise response (as indicated by the P3
component) in frontal electrode sites. Likewise, the results
for the discrimination between linear and logarithmic

conditions showed that the significant N1 component for
linear trials was located in parietal electrodes, while the P3
component for logarithmic trials was located in frontal
electrodes.
An alternative hypothesis that could explain the role of
prefrontal cortex is that it could be signaling general
attentional demands or processes of response selection that
become more active for more difficult tasks. However,
using habituation paradigms, Cantlon and her collaborators
have found greater activity in the prefrontal cortex of
children for numeric processing (Cantlon et al., 2006;
Cantlon et al., 2009). Therefore, this finding rules out the
response selection hypothesis because there was no response
needed, and brings doubts about the attentional demands
hypothesis because there should not be significant
differences in attentional demands between the number and
the control tasks used. Furthermore, in our analysis, large
numbers have smaller discrepancies between the linear and
logarithmic trials. Therefore, if this hypothesis were correct
we would expect smaller P3 amplitudes for them. Instead,
we found that large numbers elicited larger frontal P3
amplitudes.
In conclusion, this is the first study to provide neural
evidence for competing representations of numerical
magnitude. By using an ERP paradigm with a number line
estimation task, we were able to investigate numeric
processing both before participants had reached a final
decision about magnitude and a behavior was executed. This
paradigm led to the novel finding that not all numbers are
represented as linearly positioned on the number line,
despite the fact that participants’ judgments are very linear
at the behavioral level. In this way, our findings are
consistent with a novel developmental proposal that can
integrate apparently contradictory results regarding the
neural representation of numeric magnitude.
