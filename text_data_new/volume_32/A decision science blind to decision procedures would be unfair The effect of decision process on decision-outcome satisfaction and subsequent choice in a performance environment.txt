Abstract: Contemporary models of decision making assume individuals evaluate options solely in terms of their expected outcomes. However, recent research indicates that in institutional settings decision makers are also concerned
with the procedural fairness of the decision process that generates those outcomes, such as whether decision makers
were granted democratic inclusion in the decision-making process itself. We provide a much-needed quantification of
the value decision makers place on inclusive decision procedures, showing (a) the pattern by which decision procedures alter individuals’ perceptions of otherwise identical outcomes, spanning losses and gains of differing quantity
and quality (e.g., failure/success) and (b) that decision makers’ felt freedom and feeling of being treated respectfully
mediate the effect of decision process on the perception of outcomes. We show that individuals prefer lesser economic
returns in order to receive higher utility from the decision process, and we discuss the implications of this finding for
decision science.
