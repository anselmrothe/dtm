Abstract: Many models of word recognition assume that processing proceeds sequentially from analysis of form to
analysis of meaning. In the context of morphological processing, some interpret the apparent absence of differences
in recognition latencies to targets (RAT) in form and semantically similar (ratty-RAT) and in form similar and
semantically dissimilar (ratify-RAT) prime contexts as consistent with this claim. We examined the time course
over which degree of semantic similarity between morphologically related pairs influences recognition in the forward
masked priming variant of the lexical decision paradigm. Across a range of SOAs., latencies were significantly faster
after semantically similar than dissimilar primes, Results limit the scope of form-then-semantics models of recognition
and demonstrate that semantic context influences even the very early stages of recognition.
