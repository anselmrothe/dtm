Theories of the Subject-Object Asymmetry

Abstract
The Entropy Reduction Hypothesis (Hale, 2006) derives
the subject-object asymmetry in Korean relative clauses.
This asymmetry has been observed by Kwon, Polinsky, and
Kluender (2006), among others. Agreement between the Entropy Reduction predictions and the available empirical data
suggests that the heightened comprehension difficulty attested
in object-extracted relatives is due to distinctive incremental
parser states associated with comparatively greater temporary
ambiguity.
Keywords: sentence comprehension, relative clauses, Korean,
probabilistic grammar, Entropy Reduction, syntax

Introduction
Relative clauses (RCs) have long been objects of fascination
for cognitive scientists interested in language comprehension (Kaplan, 1974). In the well-known “subject-extracted”
(SRC) and “object-extracted” (ORC) cases, a large literature
exists. In languages such as English and French, a processing advantage for SRCs has been confirmed in a wide variety
of measures including phoneme-monitoring (Frauenfelder,
Segui, & Mehler, 1980), eye-fixations (Holmes & O’Regan,
1981), reading times (King & Just, 1991), PET (Stromswold,
Caplan, Alpert, & Rauch, 1996) and fMRI (Just, Carpenter, Keller, Eddy, & Thulborn, 1996). It has been suggested
that the SRC advantage may be a processing universal (Lin,
2008). If ORCs are harder than SRCs in all languages, then
what is it about human sentence comprehension that makes
this so? The Korean language is a key test for any universal processing theory because it is syntactically different
from English and French. These differences include verbfinal clauses and prenominal RCs.
In this paper, we offer an account of the SRC/ORC asymmetry in terms of the information-processing difficulty of
incremental parsing in general. This proposal relates the
hardness of parsing to syntactic facts about Korean. A language independent complexity metric known as Entropy Reduction (Wilson & Carroll, 1954; Hale, 2003, 2006) correctly derives the SRC advantage when applied with a Korean
grammar. This demonstration supports the claim that human
comprehension difficulty reflects the kind of informationprocessing work that Entropy Reduction quantifies. 1
1 A longer companion paper, Hale (under review), develops an
automaton model of the sentence comprehension process. It presents
a generalized left-corner parser that operates in accordance with the
Entropy Reduction Hypothesis when its decisions about how to resolve nondeterminism are guided by experience.

As an empirical phenomenon, the SRC/ORC processing
asymmetry is well-established. However, its implications for
the architecture or mechanisms of human language comprehension remain controversial. Three broad classes of theory
have been advanced. L INEAR D ISTANCE theories, illustrated
in Figure 1, point to a greater number of intervening elements
between the relativized position and the headnoun to which it
is meaningfully related. The boxed e notation stands for an
“empty” element. Particular theories of L INEAR D ISTANCE
offer alternative ways of measuring the separation between
this omitted position and the headnoun (Wanner & Maratsos,
1978; Gibson, 2000; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005). These theories
all provide an adequate account of the English pattern, and in
some cases relate this prediction to plausible mechanisms of
human sentence comprehension. They are thwarted, however
by data that confirm an SRC-over-ORC processing advantage
in Korean (O’Grady, Lee, & Choo, 2003; Kwon et al., 2006;
Lee, 2007). Figure 1(b) shows how theories of this type derive the wrong prediction for Korean.
The second broad class includes S TRUCTURAL D ISTANCE
theories. The simplest theory of this kind maintains that
ORCs are harder because the relativized element is more
deeply embedded when it is an object. If ORCs are formed
by a movement rule, then this movement would “cross”
both a VP node and an S node to arrive at its surface position (O’Grady, 1997, 179). Hawkins (2004, 175) singles-out
“a connected path that must be accessed for gap identification and processing.” Hawkins’ path is shown using dotted
branches in Figure 2. This path is shorter for SRCs in both
Korean and English. This general account is thus adequate
but not very precise. It leaves open, for instance, the question of where exactly greater difficulty should start to accrue
during incremental processing.
The third broad class contains the I NFORMATION THEORETICAL approaches. The Entropy Reduction Hypothesis (ERH) fits into this class. It holds that a person’s difficulty at a word reflects the amount by which that word
helped him or her to ascertain which construction the speaker
intends. The ERH uses the concept of entropy to quantify
the average uncertainty about derivations consistent with an
observed initial string. This entropy is high when there are
many equiprobable continuations and low when there are just
a few continuations or the probability distribution on them is
sharply concentrated. This quantity standsin for the degree of
confusion in the comprehender’s mind. When it is reduced in
the transition from one word to the next, the comprehender

verb suffixes as part of verbs. Here, a coindexed trace, t(3)
indicates movement of the headnoun kica ‘reporter’ from its
base position in a specifier of little v to a position outside
the RC. Weighting each construction type listed in the Appendix by its attestation count in a Korean Treebank (Han et
al., 2006), we estimate a probabilistic context-free grammar
(PCFG) of MG derivations. By chart parsing, we recover a
new PCFG for each prefix of the sentences of interest. This
chart-PCFG is an alternative presentation of the AND-OR
graph encoded by the chart (Lang, 1991). It represents all
possible analyses that are consistent with the given prefix. We
calculate the entropy of the start symbol of this chart-PCFG
to arrive at the conditional entropy of the prefix string. This
value is a cognitive model of an incremental comprehender’s
degree of confusion about which construction he or she is in.

has accomplished disambiguation work. The ERH interprets
this theoretical work as a word-by-word metric of incremental comprehension difficulty.
Hale (2006) derives Entropy Reduction predictions for English relative clauses. Asymmetries between them suggest
that relativized non-subjects are harder to comprehend because of greater temporary ambiguity at the embedded verb.
While it is well-known that Korean exhibits considerable temporary ambiguity in the middle of sentences, precise levels
have not been compared across constructions. Figure 3 illustrates this ambiguity with a prefix string that could signal at
least four different clause-types. The ERH offers the possibility of accounting for the SRC/ORC asymmetry in terms of
contrasting levels of such ambiguity.

Procedure
We calculate Entropy Reductions at every inter-word point
in Korean SRC and ORC sentences using a procedure that
mirrors Hale (2006). One of us (JY) prepared a Korean
grammar that covers the sentences listed in the Appendix.
This grammar is written in Stabler’s Minimalist Grammars
(MG) formalism (Stabler, 1997). This transformational formalism adopts certain themes of Chomsky’s Minimalist Program (1995) and has been shown to be mildly contextsensitive in the sense of Joshi (1985) by Michaelis (2001).
We consider subject-extraction and object-extraction in each
of the four clause-types shown in Figure 3. Our analysis supposes that the headnoun moves in relativization. We use the
MG move rule to implement this analysis. Figure 4 shows a
structural description generated by this grammar. This grammar analyzes postnominal case markers as separate words and

Results
Table 1 summarizes the ERH predictions: SRCs are easier
to comprehend than ORCs. This prediction also follows in
noun complement clauses. However, empty elements in subject position are not always easier. In simple matrix clauses
and adjunct clauses, no difference is predicted.

Figure 4: Structural description of SRC example (d) from the Appendix
Word-by-word Entropy Reduction graphs, shown in Figure 6, illustrate how predicted difficulty peaks coincide with
the positions that disambiguate clause-type and the role of
omitted elements. This is indicated with double-circles in
Figure 5. The subject-object asymmetry in RCs is predicted
to show up on the headnoun at the position marked N in Figure 6(d). This prediction matches the findings of Kwon et al.
(2006), who observe a reading time asymmetry at this point.

Discussion
The Entropy Reduction account of the subject advantage in
relative clauses and complement clauses is rooted in contrasting levels of uncertainty about syntactic structure. The crucial
position, immediately after the adnominal form of the verb, is
marked Ì in Figure 7. In the ORC case, the conditional entropy at this point is 32.28 bits, while in the SRC case, the
corresponding value is only 23.76 bits. The conditional entropy values at Ã are exactly the same — 17.43 bits in both

cases. Thus, the ERH models the greater difficulty in the object cases with greater conditional entropy at point Ì.
The disparity between these conditional entropies reflects
contrasting numbers of alternative continuations. These continuations correspond to different roles the prefix string might
play at the matrix level. Figure 8 shows that the ORC prefix
N NOM V-ADN could be in fact the beginning of a reading
on which the nominative-marked noun is a complete matrixlevel subject on its own, where both the subject and the object
of the embedded clause are omitted. These properties allows
the ORC prefix to have the multiple parses shown in (1-3)
below. The disparity derives, ultimately, from syntactic properties of Korean. As we have seen, it is an SOV language with
prenominal RCs; crucially, arguments may be freely omitted
when they are recoverable in-context. Such additional structures are not acceptable as a continuation of the SRC prefix
N ACC V-ADN, which cannot be split by additional empty categories.

they do include the prediction of a subject-object asymmetry
in complement clauses with omitted arguments. The effect
should appear on the word sasil ‘fact’. This prediction would
not follow on a S TRUCTURAL D ISTANCE account, since no
movement relation exists between the empty element pro and
sasil in that construction. If a subject-object asymmetry were
to be experimentally observed at that point, this would leave
the ERH as the only theory able to explain the English as well
as the Korean results. We hope that our work encourages empirical investigation of this case.

Acknowledgment
Related work
These results offer a new perspective on the work of Ishizuka,
Nakatani, and Gibson (2006). Using Japanese RCs, which
are structurally similar to Korean, these authors show that the
penalty for ORC processing can be mitigated or even eliminated if certain readings are pragmatically suppressed by
prior discourse. The ERH suggests that disambiguating those
readings is exactly the source of the ORC penalty. It quantifies the difficulty of coping with all the available alternatives.
Our results also suggest a lack of subject-object asymmetry in adjunct clauses. We would like to emphasize that this
does not entail a contradiction with the experimental results
of Kwon et al. (2006). The design of this experiment leverages that fact that a matrix clause noun is a felicitous controller of pro when it appears in an embedded clause. Indeed,
these authors suggest that “the identification of the gap in
an adjunct clause does not involve any syntactic operations.”
It is thus appropriate that our syntax-only approach predicts
no distinction between missing subjects and objects in this
clause type. The ERH might naturally be combined with a
pragmatic component to yield a broader theory. We leave this
extension to future work.

Appendix: Examples
The Minimalist Grammar used to derive the comprehensiondifficulty predictions graphed in Figure 6 covers all of the
examples listed below. The combinatorics of the promotion analysis imply the existence of other grammatical strings
such as the examples (1)–(3) in discussion.

Conclusion
The ERH, in conjunction with an appropriate formal grammar, can account for the subject advantage in Korean RCs.
Its predictions cannot be summarized by simply saying that
missing objects are always harder; for instance both types
of main clauses are predicted to be equally easy. However
