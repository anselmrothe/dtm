Linguistic Control in Monolingual and Bilingual Language Learners

Abstract: One of the difficulties in learning a new language is controlling competition from the language(s) already
known. This interference resembles between-language competition in bilinguals, whose languages are both activated
in parallel (Marian & Spivey, 2003). To test whether bilingualism confers an advantage in controlling competition
during language learning, we compared monolinguals’ and bilinguals’ ability to manage interference from English
while using a newly-learned language. Participants were taught an artificial vocabulary, then their eye-movements
and mouse-movements were tracked in a visual world paradigm to assess activation of English competitors while
processing the new language. We found that monolinguals, but not bilinguals, looked at interlingual competitors
more than at controls, indicating greater interference from English. Similarly, monolinguals, but not bilinguals,
demonstrated increased attraction to competitors compared to controls in mouse-movement trajectories. Results
suggest that bilingual experience promotes efficient management of native language activation, with implications for
linguistic control during language acquisition.
