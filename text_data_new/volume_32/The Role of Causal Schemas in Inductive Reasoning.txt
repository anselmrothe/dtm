Whereas previous research on inductive reasoning has
focused on the similarity of categories (i.e., feature overlap)
or the causal relation connecting a novel feature to the
categories, our current research explores the role of more
abstract and complex causal schemas in inductive reasoning
about hypotheses.

Abstract
Inductive reasoning allows us to go beyond the target
hypothesis and capitalize on prior knowledge. Past research
has shown that both the similarity of categories and specific
knowledge about causal relations affect inductive plausibility.
We go one step further and focus on the role of abstract
causal schemas about main effects and interactions. Two
experiments show that both prior assumptions about abstract
causal schemas and the similarity of the corresponding causal
effects affect inductive judgments. Reasoners have different
prior beliefs about the likelihood of main-effect versus
interactive schemas, and rationally combine these prior
beliefs with new evidence in a way that can be modeled as
Bayesian belief updating.

Causal Schemas in Learning

Keywords: inductive reasoning; causal schemas; causal
interactions; Bayesian inference

Introduction
Inductive reasoning occurs in various contexts. In
associative learning we infer a general regularity from a set
of learning trials. In causal learning we use a sample of
observations and go beyond the information given to induce
general causal laws. Inductions not only occur at the level of
learning exemplars but can also relate prior knowledge
about hypotheses to new hypotheses. For example, knowing
that cats have hearts allows us to give an informed guess
about the probable validity of the hypothesis that wolves
have hearts, as well. The interconnectedness of our
knowledge is a powerful tool to form informed guesses
about new hypotheses.
Although inductive inferences based on exemplars have
for a long time been studied in learning, inductions between
hypotheses is a fairly recent research goal (see Feeney &
Heit, 2007, for an overview). Many early studies have
focused on the similarity of categories as the basis for
inductive inference.
However, similarity between categories is not the only
factor influencing inductive inferences. Based on a variant
of causal-model theory, Rehder (2007) has proposed a
theory which treats inductive generalizations as causal
reasoning. According to this theory we assess the likelihood
that a novel feature applies to a new category on the basis of
our beliefs about the causal relations that connect that
feature to the category. For example, subjects tend to infer
that a category has a novel feature if they believe that this
feature is caused by or is the cause of a characteristic feature
of the category.

Thus far, causal schemas have mainly been studied in the
context of learning, not inductive reasoning. We will briefly
review this research to derive hypotheses for inductive
reasoning. Within the causal learning literature it has
typically been assumed that the default assumption about
multiple causes is that they combine additively. For
example, Cheng (1997) has postulated a noisy-OR schema
as the default for generative causes according to which
multiple causes independently generate an effect.
Although additive integration of multiple causes may be
the default, causes may also interact (Kelley, 1972; Novick
& Cheng, 2004). The majority of research about additive
integration and interactions has been conducted within the
associative learning literature. Popular examples of an
interaction are positive and negative patterning, in which the
effect cannot be predicted on the basis of an additive
integration of the individual causes. Positive patterning (PP)
refers to learning a situation in which two cues (e.g. A and
B), when presented individually, are not paired with the
outcome (A– and B– trials), but when presented together
they are paired with the outcome (AB+ trials). For example,
two drugs may individually not cause a side effect but only
in combination. The corresponding additive cue
combination (A–, B– => AB–) we henceforth call negative
main effect (ME-). In contrast, negative patterning (NP)
refers to a situation in which cues A and B, when presented
alone, are paired with the outcome (A+ and B+ trials), but
when presented together are not paired with the outcome
(AB- trials). An example of this interaction are two drugs
which each cause a side effect, but cancel out each other’s
effect when presented together. The complimentary main
effect (A+, B+ => AB+) we will call positive main effect
(ME+).
Shanks and Darby (1998) found that people can learn
both of these interactions (PP and NP) concurrently, and can
form the appropriate abstract schematic representations.
Moreover, Shanks and Darby demonstrated that people
transfer these schemas to new cues which have not
previously been shown together. For example, participants

1082

that underwent NP training with cues A and B, and were
then shown C+ and D+ trials, could infer that the novel
compound CD would not be followed by the outcome (see
also Lucas & Griffiths, 2010).
Kemp et al. (2007) have proposed a Bayesian model
which explains Shanks and Darby’s (1998) data. The model
learns causal schemas by monitoring the co-occurrences of
cues and outcomes, and groups together cues that behave in
a similar fashion. In the NP case this model groups together
cues that co-occur with the outcome in isolation, but do not
co-occur with the outcome when paired with another cue of
the same kind. Importantly, the model can use these cue
groupings to generate predictions about novel cuecombinations at test, and thus solve the [C+, D+, CD?] test
cases.
Causal schemas differ in learning difficulty in a way
consistent with the assumptions in the causal literature.
Studies of patterning have shown that learning about
patterning schemas is a difficult task and proceeds much
slower than when organisms are confronted with main
effects (Kehoe, 1988).

Causal Schemas in Inductive Reasoning
Previous research has shown that people are capable of
abstracting causal schemas from learning data and
transferring them to new situations. However, very little is
known about how causal schemas affect inductive
plausibility when knowledge is presented as a set of
individual facts and hypotheses. Based on the findings in the
learning literature and our predecessor study (O. Griffiths et
al., 2009), we expect that reasoners bring to bear different
priors about causal schemas. We expect them to consider
main-effect relations more likely than interactions,
especially disordinal ones as in the NP case. Different priors
for schema knowledge should therefore constitute one
important, hitherto neglected factor influencing inductive
plausibility between facts and hypotheses. In particular, a
simple application of Bayes’ rule predicts that a new
instance of an unlikely interaction should have a larger
impact on inductive beliefs than a new instance of a schema
that is already considered common (e.g., main effects).
A second factor we will explore in the present research
concerns the question whether the similarity of the schemas
influences induction. Since causal schema hypotheses are
abstract not only with respect to the involved cues but also
with respect to other properties of the underlying causal
relation, similarity between patterning or main effect
instances is obviously determined by at least two factors: the
similarity of the involved cues in corresponding roles (thus
the similarity between the pair of cues A and B and the pair
of cues C and D) as well as the similarity of the effects
which are generated by A and B on the one hand and C and
D on the other hand. In the present experiments we will
keep the similarity between cues constant across conditions
but we will manipulate the similarity of the effect, a factor
that has been neglected in previous research. Moreover,
similarity will be investigated in the context of both

confirming and disconfirming evidence. Our main
hypothesis is that both confirming and disconfirming
evidence should more strongly increase or decrease the prior
belief, respectively, if the similarity between the effects
mentioned in the facts and the hypotheses is high rather than
low.

Schema-based Priors and Belief Updating
O. Griffiths et al. (2009) proposed a simple Bayesian
account of schema-based belief updating which models how
people update their belief in some schema hypothesis Hi
(i.e., HPP, HNP, HME+ or HME-, respectively) given a
confirming instance D via Bayes’ rule:
𝑃 𝐻𝑖 𝐷𝑖 =

𝑃 𝐷𝑖 𝐻𝑖 𝑃 𝐻𝑖
𝑃(𝐷𝑖 )

The posterior belief in Hi depends upon the likelihood of
the confirming instance Di given Hi being true, and the
participants’ prior belief in Hi. An example would be an
inference about the hypothesis 𝐴+, 𝐵 + ⟹ (𝐴𝐵−) when
it is already known that the conclusion 𝐶+, 𝐷 + ⟹
(𝐶𝐷−) is true for novel cues C and D from the same
domain as A and B.
Assuming that people consider patterning schemas to be
less plausible than main-effect schemas, Griffiths et al.
(2009) used this Bayesian belief updating to derive the
following predictions: Beliefs regarding patterning schemas
will be change more profoundly in response to the
observation of a confirming instance than beliefs regarding
main-effect schemas. After updating, however, plausibility
ratings for patterning schemas should still not exceed those
for main-effects.
In an experiment Griffiths et al. (2009) tested these
predictions. 32 participants were presented with a series of
eight fictitious scenarios describing causal relationships
between a number of cues and an effect in several different
content domains (e.g., physics or biology). Each of the eight
trials consisted of two subscenarios (see Table 1).
Subscenario 1 contained three statements: The first two
statements, the premises, were labeled as facts (Fact A and
Fact B), and the participants were instructed to treat them as
true facts. Each of these premises described one of two cues
(A or B) that either did or did not cause an outcome. The
third statement, labeled Conclusion, was a causal statement
about the compound AB that again either did or did not
cause the same effect. The distribution of presence or
absence of the effect in the three statements determined the
cue interaction type of the trial (see Table 1). Participants
were then requested to indicate to what extent they believed
the conclusion statement to be true as well. Given that the
cues and their combinations were novel, these responses
were taken as indicators of prior beliefs in the plausibility of
the corresponding schema. Afterwards, subjects were
presented with the second subscenario, in which they
received confirming evidence in the form of three further
premises (Facts 1—3). These premises described two
different cues from the same domain (C and D) and their

1083

representing some monotone
similarity measure expressing the subjective similarity
between the instance Di and the instance addressed by Hi.
Thus, the more similar Di and Hi are, the stronger the
predicted belief update should be (either in the positive
direction in the confirming case, or in negative direction in
the disconfirming case). Disconfirming evidence is defined
as evidence that confirms the contrast hypothesis. For
example, 𝐶+, 𝐷 + ⟹ (𝐶𝐷−) confirms the negativepatterning hypothesis and disconfirms the positive maineffect hypothesis.

compound CD causing or not causing the same effect as in
the first subscenario. Moreover, the presented schema was
the same. Then the participants were once more asked to
indicate the extent to which they believed the conclusion
statement about the compound AB to be true, this time in
consideration of the additional evidence they had received
about C and D.

The results of this study were in line with the predictions
of Bayesian updating. The baseline ratings in subscenario 1
indicated that participants assigned a higher prior
probability to main effects than to patterning interactions.
The increase in the ratings between subscenarios 1 and 2
was higher for patterning interactions than for main effects,
while the mean ratings in subscenario 2 remained higher for
main effects than for patterning interactions even after
updating.

Bayesian Belief Updating and Similarity
For the sake of simplicity, Griffiths et al. (2009) assumed
that the likelihood 𝑃(𝐷𝑖 |𝐻𝑖 ) of a confirming instance Di is
represented by some fixed number larger than 0.5 (i.e., the
instance is informative) but less than 1 (i.e., the inference
from the instance to the hypothesis, which is formulated
with respect to another pair of cues, is tainted with
uncertainty), and that the likelihood is a function of the
similarity between the confirming instance Di and the
instance addressed by the hypothesis Hi.
Since the similarity of instances was not manipulated by
Griffiths et al. (2009), it remained open whether this factor
influences judgments. Making the similarity component
explicit and extending the model to disconfirming instances
the proposal of Griffiths et al. (2009) can be revised as:
𝑆 𝐷𝑖 , 𝐻𝑖

This experiment aims at replicating and extending the
results from the experiment by Griffiths et al. (2009). We
make a first attempt to manipulate the similarity between the
different hypotheses from the same domain. As laid out
above, a decrease in similarity between the confirming
instance and the instance about which the hypothesis is
formulated should decrease the tendency to generalize from
the confirmatory evidence to the conclusion statement in
question. In the present experiment we will use identical
cues in the two subscenarios (i.e., A=C, B=D) but vary the
similarity of the effects. Thus, Bayesian belief updating
predicts a stronger increase of inductive confidence from
subscenario 1 to subscenario 2 in the high similarity
condition as opposed to the low similarity condition.

Method
Participants 48 University of Göttingen undergraduates
participated in a series of various unrelated computer-based
experiments in our lab either for course credit or for €7/h.
Design The design was closely matched to the experiment
by Griffiths et al. (2009). We manipulated two independent
variables in the scenarios presented to participants. The first
factor was the type of causal schema and had four levels:
ME-, ME+, NP, and PP. The second factor was the
similarity between the to-be-judged conclusion and the
confirmatory evidence. We manipulated whether the two
scenarios used the same causal effect or different effects
from the same domain.
Each participant responded to a total of 16 scenarios. The
scenarios were randomly assigned to the experimental
conditions separately for each participant. We used a
complete 4 (Cue Interaction: ME-, ME+, NP, PP) × 2
(Similarity: same effect vs. different effect) repeatedmeasurement ANOVA design. Each subject thus received
two trials in each experimental condition. The trial order
was randomly determined for each individual participant.
Materials and Procedure Participants completed the
experiment individually on desktop computers. The
experiment began with an instruction section which
informed participants about the course of their task and
briefly tested whether they thoroughly understood it.
Afterwards, participants were presented with 16 fictitious
scenarios from different content domains (physics,
chemistry, biology, medicine) that were constructed to cover

1084

a broad range of settings. Fictitious cues and effects were
used to make sure that participants could not rely on specific
prior causal knowledge when making their inferences. Each
scenario again consisted of two subscenarios. Subscenario 1
was set up exactly as in Griffiths et al. (2009) (see upper
part of Table 1). After having read the two premises (Facts
A—B) and the Conclusion, participants indicated the extent
to which they believed the conclusion statement to be true
(this rating will be labeled Rating 1 from now on). For this
task participants were provided with an 11-point scale,
ranging from “definitely false” at the left-hand end (0) to
“definitely true” at the right-hand end (10).
After having provided this rating, participants proceeded
to subscenario 2. Its set-up was similar to that in Griffiths et
al. (2009) in that three additional facts from the same
domain were introduced (Facts 1—3; see lower part of
Table 1). These facts always constituted confirming
evidence for the hypothesis that the conclusion is true. The
three statements from subscenario 1 were repeated below
the three new statements. Apart from that, we made two
important changes in the present experiment regarding the
materials of subscenario 2 in order to manipulate the
similarity between the to-be-judged conclusion and the
confirmatory evidence. First, the confirming evidence
consisted of statements about the same cues as in the
statements in subscenario 1 (i.e., A & B), so that overall
similarity was increased compared to the material in
Griffiths et al. (2009). Second, we manipulated the
similarity between the effect caused by these cues in
subscenario 1 and in the new statements of subscenario 2. In
half of the trials, cues A and B caused (or did not cause) the
same effect in both the to-be-judged conclusion and the
provided confirmatory evidence. In the other half, the effect
differed between both sets of statements. This means that in
all same-effect conditions, in subscenario 2 Facts 1—2 were
identical to Facts A—B, and Fact 3 was identical to the tobe-judged conclusion. Logically, all participants should
have indicated certainty about the truth of the conclusion in
this condition, since it was already stated as true in the
premises. Table 2 shows the material of subscenario 2 in a
sample trial.

Following the presentation of the statements, participants
were asked once again to rate the Conclusion, using the
same scale as in subscenario 1. This rating, which was given
after confirming evidence had been presented, is from here
on referred to as Rating 2. Participants then proceeded
directly to the next scenario. This process was repeated until
all 16 scenarios were complete. The computer program
ensured that participants were not able to return to any
previous questions.

Results
The results of Experiment 1 are summarized in Figure 1.
First, different assumptions about the prior probability of
main effects vs. patterning interactions are evident in the
much higher mean ratings in Rating 1 in ME- and ME+
trials compared to NP and PP trials (F3,141=177.3, p<.001,
𝜂𝑝2 =.79). Thus, again main-effect schemas were assumed to
be more likely than interaction schemas. Second, belief
change (increase from Rating 1 to Rating 2 within
conditions) was influenced by the Cue Interaction factor
(F3,141=28.18, p<.001, 𝜂𝑝2 =.37), by the Similarity factor
(F3,47=82.39, p<.001, 𝜂𝑝2 =.64), and by the interaction
between both factors (F3,141=15.18, p<.001, 𝜂𝑝2 =.24). That is,
after receiving positive evidence, participants tended to
increase their confidence in the conclusion more in the cases
exhibiting patterning-interactions than in the cases
exhibiting main-effects. The dependence of belief updates
on prior knowledge is predicted by basic Bayesian belief
updating and replicates the findings of Griffiths et al.
(2009). The belief change is also larger when the cues cause
the same effect in both instances rather than a different
effect. Furthermore, the interaction indicates that the
difference in belief change between same-effect and
different-effect conditions was much more pronounced in
patterning-interactions than in main-effect trials (planned
contrast1: F1,47=22.05, p<.001).

Experiment 2
The main goal of Experiment 2 was to investigate how
effect similarity and type of evidence (i.e., confirming vs.
disconfirming evidence) interact with the type of causal
schemas. In Experiment 1 we have already shown that the
more similar the instances are, the more confident the
participants are in the truth of the hypothesis. Bayesian
belief updating predicts that the opposite is expected if
disconfirming evidence is presented. To test this prediction,
we included disconfirming evidence in half of the trials. In
contrast to Experiment 1, we increased the dissimilarity of
the cues between the subscenarios to test whether the
similarity of the effect event also influences inductive
ratings when the cues are more dissimilar.

(Evidence: confirming vs. disconfirming) repeatedmeasurement ANOVA design. Each participant again
responded to 16 trials, one from each condition.
Materials and Procedure The procedure and materials
corresponded to Experiment 1, apart from two changes.
First, we manipulated an Evidence factor. In half of the
trials, the additional evidence in subscenario 2 was
disconfirming rather than confirming evidence. That is,
Facts 1—3 did not instantiate the same causal schema
presented in subscenario 1, but rather its complement. If the
statements in subscenario 1 formed a positive (negative)
main effect, the additional evidence in subscenario 2 was
confirming for negative (positive) patterning, and vice
versa. The second change was that Facts 1—3 were no
longer about the same cues as Facts A—B and Conclusion
(i.e., A and B), but about different cues from the same
domain (C and D). That is, in all same-effect conditions,
both instances differed with regards to the cues, whereas
they differed with regard to both the cues and the effect in
the different-effect conditions. We thus introduced a
constant level of dissimilarity in all conditions on the cue
level so that in none of the cases the to-be-judged

as in Experiment 1. Additionally, we varied whether

evidence for the to-be-judged conclusion statement. This

The results are summarized in Figure 2. First, different
assumptions about the prior probability of main effects vs.

and PP trials (F3,141=251.6, p<.001, 𝜂𝑝2 =.84). Thus, main
effects were again assumed to be more likely than
interactions.
Second, belief change (difference between Rating 1 and
Rating 2 within conditions) was influenced by Cue
Interaction (F3,141=14.10, p<.001, 𝜂𝑝2 =.23) and type of
additional evidence (F3,47=124.42, p<.001). Planned
contrasts revealed that in the case of confirming evidence,
the increase in belief was stronger for patterning interactions
than for main effects (F1,47=11.04; p<.01); in the case of
disconfirming evidence, the decrease in belief was stronger
for main effects than for patterning interactions
(F1,47=40.06; p<.001), as predicted in (ii).
Finally, there was no main effect of the similarity factor
on belief change (F3,47<1, p=.45). This, however, was to be
expected: While the confidence in the hypothesis should
increase more after confirming evidence about the same
effect than about a different effect, it should also decrease
more after disconfirming evidence about the same effect
than about a different effect (thus, on the level of the
similarity factor both effects cancel out each other). This
prediction, in turn, is reflected in the significant Evidence ×
Similarity interaction (F3,47=82.39, p<.05, 𝜂𝑝2 =0.09) which is
driven by the predicted specific differences (planned
contrast2: F1,47=4.43, p<.05). These results confirm
prediction (iii).

General Discussion
We have presented two experiments which replicate and
extend a previous study testing a rational model of belief
updating (Griffiths et al., 2009). We showed again that
people lacking specific causal knowledge may use
knowledge about abstract causal schemas in inductive
reasoning. Moreover, we found again that people find
interactions less plausible than main effects, while, in line
with Bayesian updating, evidence about a case of an
interaction increases confidence more than evidence about
main effects, which stays at a relatively high level. In the
present study we elaborated our model to accommodate
variations of similarity and cases of confirming versus
disconfirming evidence.
The present research suggests a number of directions for
future research. In the present experiments we have shown
that the similarity of effect events influences inductive
reasoning with both confirmatory and disconfirmatory
evidence. It would be interesting to additionally explore the
role of the similarity of the cues (A-D), which was only
varied across experiments in the present paper. We expect
that both the similarity of the cues and of the effect will
equally contribute to similarity-related effects.
The present research used extremely abstract materials
and a subset of possible interaction types. It might be
interesting to look at differences between different causal
schemas when more domain knowledge is allowed (see
Waldmann, 2007, for other domain related schemas).

Finally, in the Introduction we have separated learning
tasks from inductive reasoning tasks, but combinations are
conceivable. Previous knowledge need not be stated as facts
but can be presented in the form of statistical evidence (e.g.,
learning trials). It would certainly be interesting to develop a
model of inductive reasoning that integrates prior beliefs
about abstract and specific causal relations, similarity, and
different types of evidence.
