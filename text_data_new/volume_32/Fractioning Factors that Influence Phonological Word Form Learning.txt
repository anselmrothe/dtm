Fractioning Factors that Influence Phonological Word Form Learning

Abstract: Although learning of phonological word forms is important for mastering a language, little is known
about the factors influencing it. We addressed this question by comparing phonological word form learning in two
situations: learning novel word forms as the labels for referents (deliberate word learning); and learning novel word
forms through incidental exposures to the word forms alone, without any referents (incidental word form learning).
Phonological word form learning as measured by stem completion ability was found to be better in the former than in
the latter situation (Experiment 1). Experiment 2 found that deliberate memorization of word forms, even without
any referents, also yielded better stem completion ability than purely incidental learning. These results suggest
that incidental word form learning may not yield full mastery of word forms, and that deliberate learning may be a
necessary component for such mastery.
