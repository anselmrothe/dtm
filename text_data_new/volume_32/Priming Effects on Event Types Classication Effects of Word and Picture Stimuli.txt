Empirical Correlates of Event Types

Abstract

Event types (ET) have been widely addressed in linguistic
literature, but few studies have dealt with the questions of
how they are represented, retrieved and processed in the mental lexicon. Noteworhy exceptions are: Gennari and Poeppel (2002, 2003); Finocchiaro and Miceli (2002); HeydeZybatow (2004); Bott (2008); Bonnotte (2008).
In particular, Bonnotte (2008) shows semantic priming effects of ET for ACTs and ACHs in French, reporting differences between processing of durativity and resultativity: “facilitation was shown on the former with similar and opposite
priming, whereas it was shown on the latter only with similar
priming”.

Event types (ET) have been widely addressed in linguistic literature, but few studies have dealt with the questions of how
they are represented, retrieved and processed in the mental lexicon. We report two experiments in which ET categories were
found to give rise to semantic priming effects, both with word
and picture stimuli. These effects are argued to provide empirical correlates for ET categories in the mental lexicon not only
at the lexical level but also at a deeper conceptual level.
Keywords: Semantic priming; event types; verb processing;
verb semantics; psycholinguistics.

Introduction
Event Types
Event types (ET) are an important component of the “event
structure template” (Kemmerer & Gonzales-Castillo, 2010)
of the verb, and play crucial role in the temporal constitution of the sentence. We refer here to Vendler’s (1967) standard classification of predicates into states (STA), activities
(ACT), accomplishments (ACC) and achievements (ACH)1 .
These categories can be further cross-classified with respect
to the features of dynamicity (DYN), durativity (DUR) and
resultativity (RES)2 (see Table 1).

In particular, we focused on ACHs and ACTs, because they
contrast with respect to DUR and RES: ACH [−dur, +res]
(e.g., land, die); ACT [+dur, −res] (e.g. sing, walk).

Goal of the work
The main goal of the work was the investigation of ETs in the
mental lexicon, their representation and retrieval. We report
two experiments based on the semantic priming paradigm
(see McNamara, 2005, for a review), aimed at providing empirical correlates for ET categories.
Our starting point was the study in Bonnotte (2008), which
we replicated for Italian with some crucial design innovations
(Experiment 1). This experiment was conducted at a lexical
level, using word stimuli. A second experiment (Experiment
2) introduced picture primes, in order to compare lexical semantic priming with non-linguistic priming, with the aim of
delving into a deeper conceptual level than word stimuli.
ET categories were found to give rise to semantic priming effects, both with word and picture stimuli, but with a
different pattern of results than in Bonnotte (2008): crucial
differences were found at the ET level, and not between processing of durativity and resultativity. Priming effects were
registered not only at the lexical level but also at a deeper
conceptual level.

Experiment 1
1 STA denote properties and situations experienced by the subject

as being static (e.g. to know, to be tall); ACT denote non-resultative
activities (e.g. to sing, to walk); ACC denote activities with a clear
goal or outcome (e.g. to write a book, to walk to the fence); ACH
denote a change of state (e.g. to stumble, to die).
2 DYN distinguishes among stative events and dynamic events
(e.g. to live, to know, vs. to run, to stumble). DUR events are
events perceived as lasting over time (e.g. to knit, to stir), non-DUR
events are perceived as punctual (e.g. to fall, to die). RES events
entail the existence of a clear outcome or resulting state that has to
be reached for the event to be considered completed (e.g. to land, to
write a book, vs. to fly, to talk).

Experiment 1 replicated the study conducted for French by
Bonnotte (2008). As in Bonnotte (2008), Experiment 1 was
designed to explore semantic priming effects of ET categories
in Italian.
Nevertheless, two main differences were introduced. First
of all, prime-target pairs and ACH-ACT sets were checked
and tagged with respect to their semantic class, in order to
rule out influences of the semantic class and to isolate effects
of features pertaining to ETs, i.e. DUR and RES. Semantic

predicates (114 transitive VPs - verb + object - and 22 intransitive verbs). Both transitive and intransitive verbs showing
all four of Vendler’s (1967) ET categories were used, both to
have less constrained answers and to have a broader stimuli
set for further experiments.
20 native Italian-speaking students performed the test in a
web-based format. Per each event, subjects were asked to
choose one of four pictures, one representative of each ET:

to enter - to sleep
ballare - dormire
to dance - to sleep

classes correspond to WordNet topnodes for verbs (Fellbaum,
1998). The prime and target of each test pair never belong to
the same semantic class. Semantic classes were also used
as a source of variance in the inferential statistic model. As
a further difference with Bonnotte (2008) a slightly longer
stimulus onset asyncrony (SOA) was used (300ms), in order
to avoid spillover effects with longer stimuli.

Figure 1: Pictures used in pre-test 1: the long continuous
line depicts a state that lasts in time, the long dashed arrow
depicts a process that develops over a certain period of time,
the long dashed arrow ending with a vertical dash depicts a
process that develops over a certain period of time and leads
to a result, the short arrow ending with a vertical dash depicts
an event that causes a change of state.

Method
Participants 48 native Italian speakers from the University
of Pisa and the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa volunteered
to participate in the experiment and were paid for their participation. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Materials Two groups of 18 intransitive ACT Italian verbs
and 18 intransitive ACH Italian verbs were pair-wise balanced for variables known to affect processing costs, such as
length, frequency, syntactic frame frequency, ET polysemy;
they were used as targets in the priming experiment.
The average length was 8 characters for ACTs (SD = 1.5)
and 8 for ACHs (SD = 1.5) and did not differ significantly between the two groups (Kruskal-Wallis: df = 1, χ2 = 0, p = 1).
Mean frequency (estimated from ColFis, Laudanna et al.,
1995) was 129.5 occurrences per 3 million words for ACTs
(SD = 165.5), and 88 for ACHs (SD = 173.5) and did not
differ significantly between the two groups (Kruskal-Wallis:
df = 1, χ2 = 1.683, p = 0.2). Syntactic frame frequencies
were estimated from Repubblica corpus (Lenci et al., 2010):
all verbs were intransitive and strongly monoargumental; ET
polysemy was assessed with pre-test 1.
Each target appeared in one of three prime contexts: after
a neutral prime (a string of Xs), after a similar prime (a verb
of the same ET), after an opposite prime (a verb of opposite
ET). As prime verbs we used different verbs than the target
verbs. See examples in Table 2. Each prime-target pair was
assigned to one of three lists so that an equal number of pairs
per each condition appeared on each list, so that exactly one
version of each target appeared on each list and so that each
participant saw not more than one version of each target.
Pre-test 1 Italian lacks morphological clues for ET, and
verbs tend to be ambiguous with respect to their ET category. Our experiments required non-ambiguous verbs, to be
assessed with an inter-annotators pre-test inspired by the one
in Bonnotte (2008).
Pre-test 1 was carried out to check our annotation of the
verbs according to their ET. Materials for pre-test 1 were 136

Results showed a mean accuracy of .61, inter-subject observed agreement of .5, inter-subject expected agreement of
.25 and a kappa mean value of .33. Kappa was .46 on intransitive ACHs and .34 on intransitive ACTs. Agreement values
were above chance and significantly good, since the subjects
were naive to linguistics and ET classification. 3 ACHs and
3 ACTs showing low agreement (< 0.19) were ruled out for
future experiments.
Procedure Participants were instructed to read the prime
and the target and perform a semantic decision task. Half
of the subjects were assigned a durativity decision task, the
other half were assigned a resultativity decision task. Within
the DUR task, subjects were asked:
Does the target denote a process
lasting over a period of time?
Within the RES task, subjects were asked:
Does the target denote an event with a clear outcome?
The semantic decision task directly references the manipulated variables, but nevertheless it was preferred over a more
neutral lexical decision task for a better comparison with previous results and procedures in Bonnotte (2008). Task choice
was later supported by the good accuracy results achieved.
Prime-target stimuli were presented on a screen in white
upper-case letters on a black background with an SOA of
300ms. The target was deleted after the response. Participants answered by pressing one of two buttons on a button
box, which recorded the decision latencies (DL) to one tenth
of ms accuracy. DL were recorded as the time between the
target onset and the response. Participants were given a detailed description of the experimental trials and were trained
during a special simulation session (9 practice trials) before
beginning the experiment.

The neutral prime level was used as a baseline to evaluate
the effect of opposite and similar prime on decision latencies
(DL): both primes show smaller mean DL, suggesting a general facilitation effect (see Figure 2, more detailed information on Table 5). A mixed effect model (see Table 3) of DLs3
showed that the difference between the neutral prime and the
opposite prime was highly significant, and the difference between the neutral prime and the similar prime was significant;
furthermore, it yielded a significant effect of the target’s ET.
General accuracy was .86 (.89 for DUR, .82 for RES). A
logistic regression analysis performed on errors did not yield
any effect of the priming context or of any other factor.

Separate analyses Four separate analyses were conducted,
one for each ET (ACH and ACT) within each task (DUR and
RES), using four smaller-scale mixed effect models (see Table 4). A significant difference between the neutral prime
level and the opposite prime level was found on ACH targets
for both DUR and RES tasks. A significant difference between the neutral prime level and the similar prime level was
found on ACT targets in the DUR task.

were subject, target verb, semantic class of the target.

In the DUR task, ACTs are able to prime both ACT and
ACH targets; on the other hand, in the same task ACHs never
prime either ET. This might depend on the fact that ACT are
positively marked with the feature of DUR, which is relevant
for this task. However, in the RES task, only ACTs have
a significant priming effect on ACH targets, suggesting that
priming occurs in this case only when the target is positively
marked with the feature of RES, activated in this task. Here

it is more the contrast between the [−res] of ACTs and the
[+res] of ACHs to produce a priming effect.

Experiment 2
Experiment 1 showed significant priming effects of ET at the
lexical level. The aim of Experiment 2 was to delve to a
deeper conceptual level, in order to assess if ETs are “pure
linguistic” categorizations or if they rather apply also to non
linguistic input. With this purpose, a key modification was
applied to Experiment 1: picture primes were used instead of
word primes.

of Pisa and the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa volunteered
to participate in the experiment and were paid for their participation. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

Vendler’s ET categories were used as possible answers. 20
native Italian-speaking students performed the test in a webbased format. Procedure was the same as in pre-test 1.
Results showed an inter-subject observed agreement of .42,
inter-subject expected agreement of .26 and a kappa mean
value of .21. 12 ACH pictures and 12 ACT pictures showing best agreement were chosen as primes for Experiment 2.
Kappa mean value for chosen pictures was .42 (.41 for ACHs,
.43 for ACTs).
Procedure Procedure was the same as in Experiment 1,
with one difference: picture stimuli required longer times to
be processed, and so SOA was set to a higher value (700 ms);
SOA was assessed by asking 10 more participants from the
same pool as in Experiment 1 and 2 to name the pictures. 700
ms was estimated as the shortest presentation time to allow
the participants to identify the picture.
Design Design was the same as in Experiment 1.

Materials Targets from Experiment 1 were also used as targets for Experiment 2. Each target appeared in one of three
prime contexts: after a neutral prime (a pattern of Xs), after a similar prime (a picture depicting an event of the same
ET), after an opposite prime (a picture depicting an event of
opposite ET). Picture primes were selected from the IPNP
database (Bates et al., 2000, see examples in Figure 3) and
their association with ET categories was assessed through
pre-test 2. Each prime-target pair was assigned to one of
three lists so that an equal number of pairs per each condition appeared on each list, so that exactly one version of each
target appeared on each list and so that each participant saw
not more than one version of each target.

DLs4 showed that the difference between the neutral prime
and the similar prime was the only one to reach significancy;
furthermore, it yielded a significant effect of the target’s ET,
of the task and of the featural value ([+/−dur], [+/−res]) of
the target.
General accuracy was .92 (.94 for DUR, .90 for RES). A
logistic regression analysis performed on errors did not yield
any effect of the priming context or of any other factor.
Separate analyses Four separate analyses were conducted,
one for each ET (ACH and ACT) within each task (DUR and
RES), using four smaller-scale mixed effect models (see Table 7). A significant difference between the neutral prime
level and the similar prime level was found on ACH targets
for both DUR and RES tasks.
A striking difference with respect to Experiment 1 is the
absence of priming effects with ACTs, both as target or prime.
This fact might be due to the inherently ”static” character of
picture stimuli, which makes the [+dur] of ACTs less salient.

General Discussion and Conclusions
In line with both our expectations and the study in Bonnotte
(2008), our experiments yielded significant priming effects
of ET, thus providing evidence to the idea that ETs are indeed
relevant for the mental lexicon. This conclusion is further
supported by the crucial innovation we introduced in the ex4 Fixed effects were prime, task, ET of the target, featural value
([+/−dur], [+/−res]) of the target; random effects were subject,
target verb, semantic class of the target.

periments, i.e. controlling the semantic class of prime and
target verbs. The priming effects can thus be related to the
more abstract event structure shared by verbs that greatly differ for other dimensions of their meaning.
In addition to this, two different modalities were explored
and contrasted: word primes and picture primes. Using picture stimuli is a first but significant attempt to place the study
of ETs within a broader frame of study of event meaning
in cognition. The Embodied Cognition Framework (Evans
& Green, 2006; Haggard et al., 2007; Barsalou, 2008) suggests that semantic representations are not purely amodal, but
rather grounded in our sensorimotor perception, and it has
been suggested that processing a verb might involve ”covertly
recapitulating” the event it refers to (Kemmerer & GonzalesCastillo, 2010).
The effect of facilitation given by the word primes is not
surprising; the negative priming which we report for the picture primes is usually explained with a combination of inhibition (an effort of selective attention to avoid a previous
stimulus) and memory retrieval (see Tipper, 2001, for a review). Picture primes seem to act at a deeper level than word
primes, and it is crucial that the negative priming is found in
the similar prime condition: similar primes seem to be more
difficult for subjects to ignore.
Moreover, the pattern of results offered by this study suggests a different explanation of such priming effects than the
one offered by Bonnotte (2008) (see Table 8). Bonnotte
(2008) suggests a crucial difference between processing of

durativity and resultativity: “facilitation was shown on the
former with similar and opposite priming, whereas it was
shown on the latter only with similar priming”. Nevertheless, the pattern emerging from our experiments does not
show great differences between processing of durativity and
resultativity, but rather suggests a difference at the level of ET
categories, which seem to differ with respect to their behavior
in both tasks. Differences in priming effects across ET categories can be ascribed to different lexical encodings of their
ET features: the [+dur] and [−res] of ACTs is more ductile
and subject to contextual adaption, whereas ACHs are more
“inherently” [−dur] [+res]. Moreover, ACTs do not seem to
be affected by priming with picture stimuli, which might be
problematic in conveying the [+dur] [−res] nature of ACTs.
In the near future a comparison will be carried out with a similar study of Russian (Batiukova et al., 2010).
The use of videos was also contemplated for this study, but
pictures were preferred for a first exploration of the visual
modality because the IPNP database provided a convenient
standard of stimuli and because picture primes allowed for
shorter SOAs. This would not have been the case for video
stimuli. Nevertheless, videos have been used in the investigation of event representations (e.g. Gennari et al., 2002)
and, since they could provide a better depiction of both DUR
and RES, this modality would definitely be of some interest
for further work, in order to more thoroughly investigate ET
representations in the mental lexicon.
ET categories were found to give rise to semantic priming
effects, at both word and picture levels, which, albeit with
crucial cross-modal differences, provide empirical correlates
for ET categories in the mental lexicon and suggest that ETs
are not only a linguistic phenomenon, but relate with our way
of conceptualizing events in the world.
