Abstract: Consciousness is regarded as too ambiguous a concept to be understood and accepted as a mental construct without the inclusion of memory and attention in any conceptualization. We need one criterion to count
satisfactorily as an explanation of consciousness in information processing. An operational working definition of consciousness could be made in comparison of memory and attention: Consciousness would be a subjective awareness of
momentary experience and also have the characteristics of an operating system performing control and consolidation
information processing, even though those are not equivalent concepts. This could be called a cognitive consciousness.
If cognitive consciousness is postulated as a mental construct characterizing awareness, control and consolidation, the
phenomena like word superiority effect, auditory continuity and object categorization, could be understood clearly,
which was not the case in the past.
