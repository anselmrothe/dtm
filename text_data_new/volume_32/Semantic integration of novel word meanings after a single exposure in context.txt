Abstract

Background

We investigated the influence of sentence context on initial
integration of novel word meanings into semantic memory.
Adults read strongly or weakly constrained sentences ending
in known and unknown (novel) words as electrical brain
activity was recorded. Word knowledge was assessed via a
lexical decision task where recently seen known and unknown
word sentence endings served as primes for related, unrelated,
and synonym/identical target words. N400 amplitudes to
target words preceded by known word primes were reduced
by prime relatedness. Critically, N400 amplitudes to targets
preceded by novel words also varied with prime relatedness,
but only if they initially appeared in highly constraining
sentences. These results demonstrate that electrical brain
activity accompanying one-shot contextual word learning is
modulated by contextual constraint and reveals a rapid neural
process that can integrate information about word meanings
into the mental lexicon.

Word learning is a lifelong process. However, research on
adult first language word learning has largely been eclipsed
by word learning in children and in adult bilinguals. Though
these areas of study have yielded important insights into
word learning, the mode by which adults learn words in their
native language is likely to differ from that of children. For
example, while children typically map words to novel or
unnamed concepts (Markman & Wachtel, 1988), adults more
often learn nuanced meanings for name-known concepts
(e.g. jocund/happy). Furthermore, younger children often
learn words in oral and ostensive contexts, whereas older
children and adults acquire words largely via incidental
learning in various language contexts, especially during
reading (Jenkins, Stein, & Wysocki, 1984; Sternberg, 1987).
Word learning can be remarkably fast under the right
conditions. A single exposure to a novel word can be
sufficient for a learner to infer its probable meaning (Carey
& Bartlett, 1978; Dollaghan, 1985). However, little is known
about contextual influences on the representation of novel
word meanings learned from a single exposure, how quickly
this new information is integrated with the existing semantic
system, or what the neural correlates of this rapid learning
may be. The main goal of our research is to explore these
issues by measuring modulation of event-related brain
potentials (ERPs) during single trial word learning in
sentence contexts of varying strength.

Studies of adult first and second language learners provide
evidence for rapid neural changes in young adults in
association with word learning in both first (L1) and second
(L2) languages (Borovsky, Elman, & Kutas, 2007;
McLaughlin, Osterhout, & Kim, 2004; Mestres-Misse,
Rodriguez-Fornells, & Münte, 2006; Perfetti, Wlotko, &
Hart, 2005; Stein et al., 2006). For example, McLaughlin
and colleagues (2004) compared brain responses in native
French speakers to undergraduates learning French as a
second language. They found that college language learner’s
brain responses during a semantic priming task using French
words were indistinguishable from native speakers after only
a few months of instruction. Their findings demonstrate not
only that the brain may process word meanings acquired in
childhood and adulthood similarly, but that lexical
acquisition over extended training can be measured by
modulations in neural activation.
L1 word learning studies have suggested that even faster
neural changes due to word learning are possible (Perfetti,
Wlotko & Hart, 2005; Mestres-Missé, Rodriguez-Fornells &
Münte, 2007; Borovsky, Elman & Kutas, 2007). For
example, Mestres-Missé and colleagues (2007) found that
three presentations of a novel word in progressively
constraining sentence contexts can significantly modulate
the associated neural responses. We (Borovsky, Elman &
Kutas, 2007) further examined the influence of contextual
constraint on novel word usage after only a single
presentation. Novel words were presented in a single highly
or weakly constraining sentence context. Subsequently,
participants were asked to differentiate between appropriate
and inappropriate usages of these novel words as objects of
particular verbs. Participants were able to incorporate
significant information about the proper usage of novel
words after a single exposure, but only when the novel
words initially appeared in highly (and not in weakly)
constraint contexts.
While comprehending a word’s usage is an important
aspect of vocabulary acquisition, knowledge of a word’s
relationship to other words is also vital. For example, part of
our understanding of the words CAT, DOG and CHAIR, is
that CAT and DOG have many overlapping similarities and
features that neither shares with CHAIR. Research has
indicated that adults can gain significant knowledge of these

1307

relationships with a few exposures in sentences (MestresMisse et. al, 2006). In the present study, we ask whether
even one exposure suffices to enable learners to incorporate
the novel word into the semantic network that functionally
connects words with related meanings, and how sentence
contexts might influence this acquisition, if at all. More
specifically, we use an event-related brain potential (ERP)
component - the N400 - to index knowledge of word
meaning via semantic priming when unknown words are
initially presented in sentences that either strongly or weakly
constrain their meaning.
The N400 is an ERP component that is a sensitive
measure of semantic processing. It is a negative going wave
with a centroparietal maximum that peaks approximately
400ms after the onset of any potentially meaningful
stimulus. The N400 amplitude of word is reduced when it is
(contextually) expected or when features associated with its
meaning are easily integrated within the surrounding context
(Kutas & Federmeier, 2000; Kutas & Hillyard, 1980)
Additionally, the N400 to orthographically legal and
pronounceable nonwords (pseudowords) is large (Ziegler,
Besson, Jacobs, Nazir, & Carr, 1997); it is not present for
true nonwords that do not have orthographically legal
spellings, or are unpronounceable (Bentin, 1987). The N400
is modulated by lexical frequency and is larger for lower
frequency words in lists (Smith & Halgren, 1987). N400
amplitude, thus, is associated with a word’s meaningfulness
in a given context, ranging from small in amplitude when a
word is very easily integrated or understood, to large when a
word’s meaning is unknown. These findings suggest that
N400 amplitude is likely to vary with the degree to which
the meaning of a newly encountered word is appreciated – a
prediction that has been borne out by recent research in L2
and L1 word learning (e.g., McLaughlin, Osterhout & Kim,
2004; Mestres-Misse et. al. 2007).
Target words preceded, or primed, by an identical or
related word (for example doctor- NURSE, or doctorDOCTOR) are associated not only with faster response times
(e.g., Neely, 1991), but with reduced N400 amplitudes
(Bentin, McCarthy, & Wood, 1985; Nobre & McCarthy,
1994), compared to target words preceded by words that are
unrelated in meaning, or by nonwords (i.e. doctor-CHAIR,
or doctor-FOOP). Such semantic priming effects have been
interpreted as reflecting the functional organization of words
in the brain (Collins & Loftus, 1975; Lucas, 2000).
In this study, we examine the impact of context on novel
words’ initial integration in semantic memory via semantic
priming. Following an initial exposure in a strongly or
weakly constraining sentence, we gauge successful word
meaning acquisition by means of semantic priming in a
lexical decision task.
In this case, N400 amplitude
modulation to a target word by a recently experienced prime
word is taken as an index of semantic integration of the
novel word’s meaning into semantic memory. We use N400
amplitudes to gauge how contextual constraint influences
acquisition of word meaning by contrasting how these novel
words prime target words that are identical, related, or

unrelated in (implied) meaning. We can also explore how
context impacts the integration of novel word meaning into
the mental lexicon by assessing the interaction between the
priming effect and contextual constraint.

Methods
Participants:
24 college students (13 F) were given credit or paid $7/hr for
their participation. Ages ranged between 18-30 (mean:
19.50). All participants were right-handed, native English
speakers and had no significant exposure to another
language at least before the age of 12. Participants reported
no history of mental illness, learning disability, language
impairment, drug abuse, or neurological trauma. All
participants had normal hearing and normal (or corrected to
normal) vision. An additional 11 participated but were not
analyzed: 5 had excessive blinking or motion artifact, 1 due
to equipment failure, and 5 reported a characteristic which
disqualified them from analysis (4 had significant childhood
second language exposure, 1 had non-normal vision.)

Materials:
Stimuli consisted of 132 sentence pairs selected from
Federmeier and Kutas (1999), and 528 word pairs selected to
correspond with 132 sentence final words. Both are
described in detail below:
Sentences: 64 high constraint and 64 low constraint
sentence pairs were selected from Federmeier and Kutas
(1999). These pairs had previously been extensively normed
to ensure adequate levels of cloze probability for high and
low constraint sentences. Sentence pairs consisted of an
initial sentence that set up an expectation of a meaning and
item category, and a second sentence that was matched with
sentence final words that were either plausible and expected
known word sentence completions (Federmeier & Kutas,
1999), or unknown pseudowords, yielding 32 sentences in
each of four main conditions: 1) High constraint / Known
word ending, 2) High Constraint / Unknown word ending 3)
Low constraint / Known word ending and 4) Low constraint
/ Unknown word ending (see Table 1a for examples).
Sentences pairs were counterbalanced such that each
appeared with a Known and Unknown ending equally across
all versions, but not repeated within a subject. Known word
target items consisted of words in 64 categories, and these
categories were used as the basis for selecting semantically
related and unrelated prime-target pairs, described below.
Word-Pairs: 528 word pairs were constructed that consisted
of a prime followed by a target word presented one stimulus
at a time. Since repetition is known to diminish N400 effects
(Van Petten, Kutas, Kluender, Mitchiner, & McIsaac, 1991),
and it is unclear if repetition and constraint might interact,
we designed the priming task such that the N400 of interest
was to the presentation of a target word that followed a
prime that was either a Known or Unknown words from the
sentence endings described above. The N400 effect of
interest would thus be elicited to previously unseen real

1308

word targets in three conditions: 1) Synonym/Identical
(Syn/ID: rabbit-RABBIT), 2) Related (Rel: rabbit-MOUSE),
and 3) Unrelated (Unrel: rabbit-RIBBON). Unrel and Rel
word pairs were selected to be closely matched to other
target conditions in word frequency (F(2, 353)=1.09,
p=0.34) length (F<1)), syllables (F<1), and phonemes (F<1),
as reported by the MRC psycholinguistic database (Wilson,
1988). Efforts were also made to match targets as closely as
possible on Concreteness, Familiarity and Imageability
ratings when they were available. Additionally, targets in
each condition did not differ as a function of constraint in
frequency [Syn/ID: |t| <1, Rel: |t| <1, Unrel: t(130)=1.06,
p=0.29 ] length [Syn/ID: t(130)=-1.45, p=0.15, Rel: |t| <1,
Unrel: t(130)=-1.27, p=0.21], # syllables [Syn/ID: |t| <1,
Rel: |t| <1, Unrel: |t| <1 ], and #phonemes [Syn/ID: t(130)=1.36, p=0.18, Rel: |t| <1 , Unrel: t(130)=-1.32, p=0.19].
Highly associated word pairs were not included (like mouseCHEESE), as confirmed via the Edinburgh Associative
Thesaurus (Kiss, Armstrong, Milroy, & Piper, 1973). In
cases involving Unknown word primes, Syn/ID, Rel and
Unrel, was determined by its implied meaning from sentence
context in which it had previously appeared.
An equal number of Nonword targets were also
constructed so that the proportion of “Yes” and “No” lexical
decision responses were equivalent. Nonwords were
constructed using the ARC Nonword database (Rastle,
Harrington, & Coltheart, 2002), and were selected to be
pronounceable, and to contain between 4-7 letters.
In each version, each Known and Unknown prime was
paired with two of three possible real word targets, and two
nonword targets. The proportion of targets in each condition
was: Nonwords=1/2, Syn/ID=1/6, Rel=1/6, Unrel=1/6.
Known and Unknown prime was matched with the targets
with equal frequency across versions. Table 1b includes
examples of word pairs in the study.

viewed two sets of prime/target pairs, and were given a
2500ms offset period to blink between pairs. Prime pair
onsets were preceded by a set of fixation crosses that were
randomly presented for 200-500ms. Immediately following
the fixation cross, a prime word appeared for 200 ms,
followed by an offset of 300ms, followed by the target word
presentation for 200ms, and offset of 800ms. Participants
provided a lexical decision response as soon as possible after
each target word appeared in capital letters.

Procedure:
Participants were tested in a soundproof, electricallyshielded chamber and were seated in a comfortable chair in
front of a monitor. The experiment consisted of two
interleaved tasks: sentence comprehension and priming.
In the sentence comprehension task, participants were
instructed to read the sentence pairs for comprehension and
to try to understand the sentences even when nonsense words
appeared. The first sentence in each pair was presented in its
entirety, and participants pressed a button to indicate that
they were ready for the second. The second sentence was
preceded by a series of crosses (500 ms duration with a
stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) varying randomly
between 300-800 ms) to orient the participant toward the
center of the screen. Sentences were presented one word at a
time, each for 200 ms with a SOA of 500 ms. Participants
were asked to minimize blinking and movement during
sentences. The final target word appeared for 1400 ms.
In the priming task, participants were instructed to read
every word that appeared on the screen and indicate with a
button press if the target item (which always appeared in

The experiment consisted of 11 blocks of sentence/prime
sets that were interleaved as follows. Participants read 12
sentence pairs, before completing the priming task consisting
of 48 pairs, with primes being selected from the 12
immediately preceding sentence endings. Participants were
given a break after each sentence/priming set.
In order to ensure that participants attended to the study
sentences, participants were given a surprise old/new
memory post-test containing 50 sentences that had appeared
in the study, and 50 sentences that had not.

Electrophysiological recording:
Scalp potentials were continuously recorded from 26
geodesically arranged sites using an ElectroCap with tin
electrodes and a left mastoid reference. Potentials were
digitized at a sampling rate of 250 Hz and hardware
bandpass filter of 0.1-100Hz with Grass Amplifiers.
Impedances were kept below 5 kΩ.

Data analysis: Data were re-referenced offline to an average
left and right mastoid. Trials contaminated by eye
movements, blinks, excessive muscle activity, or amplifier
blocking were rejected offline before averaging. ERPs were
computed for epochs extending from 100 ms pre-stimulus
onset to 920 ms post-stimulus onset. Averages of artifactfree ERP trials were computed for the target words in the
four learning conditions (High/Known, High/Unknown,
Low/Known, Low/Unknown) as well as to targets in all
priming conditions (Syn/ID, Rel, and Unrel targets for each
of the four main conditions High/Known, High/Unknown,
Low/Known, Low/Unknown) after subtraction of the 100 ms

Known/Low, and Unknown/Low. These analyses revealed
that targets preceded by Known/High and Known/Low
primes elicited faster RTs when preceded by a word identical
in meaning, compared to a related or unrelated word. On the
other hand, targets preceded by Unknown words did not
elicit priming effects in any condition (all p>0.05).

ERP data: N400 amplitude
Context sentence endings: We analyzed ERP responses to
sentence endings in four conditions: Known/High,
Known/Low, Unknown/High and Unknown/Low. ERPs to
sentence endings are shown in Figure 1. N400 mean
amplitude was measured between 250-500ms post final word
onset at four centro-parietal electrode sites (RMCe, LMCe,
MiCe, MiPa) where N400 effects are typically largest. A
two-factor repeated measures ANOVA with factors of Word
Type (Known and Unknown) and Constraint (High and
Low) revealed an effect of Word Type [F(1,23)=28.85,
p<.0001] with Unknown word endings eliciting larger N400s
than Known word endings. No other main or interaction
effects were observed.

Note: Standard deviations are reported in parenthesis.

Results
Behavioral performance:
Participants made lexical decisions for words that were
identical, related, or unrelated in meaning to a prime word.
Mean accuracy and RTs are shown in Table 2. We did not
statistically analyze accuracy since accuracy was near
ceiling, with the lowest accuracy in any condition being
93%. For RT, A three factor repeated measures ANOVA on
RT was carried out with factors of Word type (Unknown and
Known) x Constraint (High and Low) x Prime relationship
(Identical, Related and Unrelated). A main effect of Prime
was found [F(2, 46)=85.49, p< 0.0001], with Tukey tests
revealing that this effect was driven by faster responses to
Identical targets than every other condition. No overall
difference was found between Rel and Unrel conditions.
There was also a main effect of Word Type [F(1, 23)=11.94,
p=0.002] driven by faster responses to targets preceded by
Known vs. Unknown words. An interaction of Prime x Type
was also found [F(2, 46)=29.2, p<0.0001]. Follow-up
Tukey tests revealed that this interaction was driven by
targets that were preceded by Syn/ID Known words eliciting
the fastest responses compared to other conditions. There
were no other significant interactions.
Although no
significant three-way interaction was found, pairwise
comparisons were conducted to examine the relationships
between Syn/ID, Rel and Unrel meanings in each of the four
prime
conditions:

Discussion
This study explored the neural correlates of the rapid
acquisition of recently experienced novel word meanings in
adults’ native language. Our goal was to understand the
influence of sentential constraint on the integration of novel
word meanings into the “mental lexicon” after only a single
exposure. We measured behavioral and ERP responses in
priming task to ask if the information that is rapidly
integrated about novel word meanings includes information
about a word’s lexico-semantic relationships with other
(known) words.
The behavioral (lexical decision) results did not reveal
evidence of priming between novel words and related or
synonymous targets. This result alone would suggest that no
learning occurred regardless of sentential constraint. The
electrophysiological results, however, support a different
conclusion.
Known word primes produced N400 priming effects
replicating a well-established result: smaller N400
amplitudes to target words preceded by identical or related
words, relative to unrelated words. This was also the pattern
for Unknown words (or perhaps more accurately, recently
seen words) but only if it had initially appeared in a strongly

wave, larger N400 amplitudes are represented by smaller
values on this figure.
Previous work has suggested that adults can integrate and
organize information about word meanings after a few of
weeks of second language instruction (McLaughlin et al.,
2004; Stein et al., 2006), and even more rapidly in adult’s
first language, such as after only an hour of study of word
definitions (Perfetti et al., 2005) or after three presentations
in sentential context (Mestres-Misse et al., 2006). Our results
extend these findings to show that in some cases a single
exposure of a novel word in a strongly constraining sentence
context is sufficient to convey significant information about
its meaning to support semantic priming, and that there is a
very fast neural process which enables the integration and
retention of this information over at least a several minute
delay. We add to a growing body of evidence that the
rapidly acquired information about novel words includes

1311

information not only about its usage in sentences but also
about its meaning.
More generally, this paradigm suggests a novel method to
examine the impact of sentential context and constraint on
word processing. Further research will be necessary to
extend these findings to other aspects of word meaning and
knowledge, and to determine how long such information
about a word’s usage and meaning is retained and is
effective.
