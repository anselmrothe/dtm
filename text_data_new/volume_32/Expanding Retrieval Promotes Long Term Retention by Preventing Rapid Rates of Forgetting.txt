Abstract
Expanding retrieval, increasing the delay between retrieval
attempts of recently studied material, should lead to better
memory than equally spaced retrieval, however, recent results
have been mixed. Ninety-six participants studied word pairs
with the following expansion schedules: 1-2-3; 1-5-9; 3-5-8;
5-8-13. An evenly spaced (5-5-5) condition was also used. A
final test was given after a 10 minute or 48 hour retention
interval. Performance after the 48 hour retention interval was
best in the 5-8-13 condition. The higher level of performance
in this condition was due to no forgetting between the final
learning trial and the immediate final test.

Introduction
Spacing out study trials and retrieval attempts is a simple
and effective way to improve memory for verbal
material(see Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted & Rohrer, 2006
for a review). Repeated testing has also produced robust
memory effects in the laboratory (Roediger & Karpicke,
2006) and classroom studies of repeated testing. One aspect
of repeated testing that has produced mixed results is the
effects of timing of the repeated tests or retrieval practice on
long term retention. Two basic ways that repeated testing
can be implemented are to evenly space out the retrieval
attempts or to gradually increase the interval between each
retrieval attempt, called expanding retrieval. Intuitively,
expanding retrieval is thought to improve long term
retention, yet the literature is mixed. This experiment
investigated two different aspects of the retrieval schedule,
the number of intervening items between the study period
and the first retrieval attempt and the number of intervening
items in the remainder of the schedule, to further delineate
the conditions under which expanding retrieval may or may
not improve long term retention.

Expanding Retrieval
Expanding retrieval is a method in which an initial study
period is followed by retrieval attempts that are spaced out
with increasingly longer intervals between each attempt.
For example, a typical expansion sequence used in the
literature is a 1-5-9 sequence (see Cull, Shaughnessy, &
Zechmeister, 1996; Karpicke & Roediger, 2007), meaning
that after the initial study period, there is one intervening
item between study and retrieval, then five intervening
items between the first and second retrieval attempts, and

finally, nine intervening items between the second and third
retrieval attempts.
Intuitively, and anecdotally, expanding retrieval is
thought to produce better long term retention than evenly
spaced retrieval. Theoretically, one would expect expanding
retrieval to improve long term memory based on the
principle of desirable difficulty (Bjork, 1994). According to
Bjork (1994), conditions that introduce difficulty into the
learning process increase the likelihood of retrieving the
information on a long term retention test. Expanding
retrieval is built on the idea of introducing difficulty into the
learning process. The initial conceptualization of expanding
retrieval posited that the first retrieval attempt should occur
soon after the learning trial to ensure successful retrieval.
Difficulty is introduced on subsequent retrieval attempts by
increasing the number of intervening items between each
attempt. Gradually increasing the delay between each
retrieval attempt makes each subsequent attempt more
difficult than the previous attempt. Surprisingly, recent
research investigating the benefits of expanding retrieval has
produced mixed results. Some studies have found that
expanding retrieval does improve memory when compared
to an evenly spaced control condition (Cull et al., 1996)
whereas others found that expanding retrieval is no better
than evenly spaced retrieval (Logan & Balota, 2008).
Karpicke and Roediger (2007) explored possible reasons
for the mixed results and found that the benefits of
expanding retrieval depend on two factors: the time of the
final test (immediate or delayed) and the number of items
between the study trial and the first retrieval attempt. With
respect to the time of the final test, expanding retrieval
produced better performance than evenly spaced retrieval on
a test that occurred 10 minutes after learning. When the
final test occurred after a 48 hour retention interval, the
effects reversed, and equally spaced retrieval produced
superior performance compared to the expanding retrieval
conditions. The results of the second factor that was
investigated, the delay between the study period and the first
retrieval attempt, indicated that expanding retrieval
improved retention the most when the first retrieval attempt
was delayed regardless of the rest of the sequence (whether
it was evenly spaced or expanding).
Although Karpicke and Roediger (2007) addressed and
reduced the confusion surrounding expanding retrieval, the
extant research on expanding retrieval is restricted by two
limitations. One limitation (see Karpicke and Roediger,
2007, Exp. 3) was that the expanding sequences that were
used to investigate the number of intervening items between

2123

study and the first retrieval attempt were not true expanding
sequences. In order to investigate the interval between the
study trial and the first retrieval attempt and to control for
the number of intervening items, the sequences were
constructed by simply adding an initial retrieval attempt
onto the standard 5-5-5- and 1-5-9 sequences. The evenly
spaced sequence became a 5-5-5-5 sequence and the
expanding sequence became a 5-1-5-9 sequence. The
expanding sequence was no longer a true expanding
sequence as it contracted before expanding. This
experiment addressed this issue by comparing the 5-5-5
sequence against an expanding sequence that started with a
first retrieval attempt after 5 intervening items (5-8-13).
The other limitation is that few other studies investigating
expanding retrieval have distinguished between the
effectiveness of different expansion sequences (but see
Logan & Balota, 2008), and most studies have used a 1-5-9
expanding sequence (Cull et al, 1996; Karpicke & Roediger,
2007; Morris, Fritz, Jackson, Nichol, & Roberts, 2005).
Other schedules have been used, for example Landauer and
Bjork (1978) used 1-4-10 and 0-1-3-8 schedules, and in an
experiment with preschool age children, Fritz, Morris,
Nolan and Singleton (2007) used a 1 minute-1day-2 day
expansion sequence. However, the different schedules have
not been compared against one another. Other than
Karpicke and Roediger’s (2007) investigation of the initial
retrieval attempt and Logan and Balota’s (2008) study of
various schedules of spacing, the remainder of the
expansion schedule has not been a variable of interest.
Thus, the present experiment investigated different
expansion sequences to determine if the benefits of
expanding retrieval depend on the particular sequence that is
used.
According to Bjork’s theory of Desirable Difficulty it is
critical to create a task that is challenging and difficult for
the individual, but is not so difficult such that the individual
cannot complete the task. The difficulty of the expansion
sequence can be manipulated by increasing the number of
intervening items between the study trial and the first
retrieval attempt or by increasing the average number of
intervening items across the entire expansion schedule.
This experiment manipulated both types of difficulty, but
focused on the number of intervening items between the
study trial and the first retrieval attempt.

two previous numbers in the sequence. By using portions of
the Fibonacci sequence for each of the novel sequences used
in this experiment, each expanding sequence expands in the
same way.
The expansion sequences used in this study were chosen
from the Fibonacci sequence by considering two factors.
First, the critical issue in this experiment was to investigate
the number of intervening items between the study trial and
the first retrieval attempt. Thus, sequences were selected by
choosing different starting points in the Fibonacci sequence
to correspond to the initial retrieval attempts that have been
used in previous literature (1 or 5). This resulted in the 1-23 and 5-8-13 sequences. The other factor that was
considered was the average number of intervening items
across the entire sequence. The average number of
intervening items in the 5-5-5 and 1-5-9 sequences that are
typically used in the literature is 5. Thus, the 3-5-8
condition was selected.
The comparison of most interest was to investigate the
difference in performance between the 5-5-5 condition and
the expanding condition that also had five intervening items
between the study trial and the first retrieval attempt, 5-813. This comparison was vital because Karpicke and
Roediger’s (2007) investigation of this variable found that
delaying the first retrieval attempt improved performance
regardless of the rest of the expansion sequence. However,
the expansion sequences were different from the expansion
sequences used in this experiment as their sequences started
over from 1 after the first retrieval attempt (5-1-5-9)
whereas the expansion sequence in the present experiment
continued to expand from that first retrieval attempt (5-813).

The Current Experiment

The experiment used a 2 (retention interval) x 7 (testing
schedule) mixed design. The final retention interval (10
minutes or 48 hours) was manipulated between subjects and
the various testing schedules were manipulated within
subjects. The testing schedules included an evenly spaced
control (5-5-5), 3 expanding schedules based on the
Fibonacci sequence (1-2-3; 3-5-9; 5-8-13), a standard
expanding schedule (1-5-9), and two single test conditions
in which participants took a single test immediately
(Single0) or after 2 intervening items (Single2).
The experiment was based on Karpicke and Roediger
(2007), using word pairs in which the first word was an
unfamiliar (low frequency) word such as Tumbrel, and the

The current experiment investigated 5 different sequences:
an evenly spaced control (5-5-5) and four expansion
sequences (1-2-3; 1-5-9; 3-5-8; 5-8-13). The 1-5-9
sequence was chosen because it has been used in the
majority of previous research. Although the expansion
sequences may appear to be chosen at random, the three
novel sequences used in this study (1-2-3; 3-5-8; 5-8-13)
were chosen because they come from the same number
sequence that occurs in nature, the Fibonacci sequence. The
Fibonacci sequence is a naturally expanding sequence in
which each number is determined by adding together the

Method
Participants
Ninety-six undergraduate students at Auburn University
participated in the study in exchange for extra credit for a
psychology course. Participant were between the ages of 17
and 25, 74% were female, 26% were male, 88% were
white, 9% were African American, and 3% identified
themselves as another race/ethnicity.

second word was a one word synonym or definition, Cart.
During the study phase, the word pairs were presented
together, Tumbrel-Cart, and during the testing phases the
first word was presented and participants were required to
type in the appropriate word pair. Fifty-six word pairs were
constructed. Forty of the word pairs were critical word
pairs. For each of the 7 testing conditions, there were 5
word pairs to study. The remaining 5 items served as
unstudied control items. Eight counterbalancing conditions
were constructed to allow for each set of 5 word pairs to be
rotated through each of the testing and unstudied conditions.
This resulted in 40 critical word pairs (5 for each of the 7
conditions, counterbalanced so remaining 5 were unstudied
or control items). Additionally, 16 filler items were
included for a total of 56 word pairs. Two filler items were
used as buffers at the beginning of the task, and 3 filler
items were used as buffers at the end of the task. The
remaining fillers were interspersed throughout the list to
allow for the appropriate spacing of all of the study and test
trials. This resulted in a total of 142 trials in the experiment.

Learning Trials
A 5(spacing condition) x 3 (learning trial) within subjects
ANOVA was conducted (the single trial conditions were not
included in this analysis). The effect of learning trial was
significant, F (2, 464) = 5.82, p = .003, partial ?2= .02,
which was qualified by a significant interaction of learning
trial and spacing condition F (8, 930) = 4.52, p < .001,
partial ?2= .04. Table 1 shows that performance in the two
conditions in which there was only one intervening item
between the study trial and the initial retrieval attempt (1-23 and 1-5-9) was much higher on the learning trials than the
other three spacing conditions (3-5-8; 5-8-13; 5-5-5),
indicating that the trials that had more intervening items
before the first retrieval attempt were more difficult to learn
(See Table 1).

Procedure
Data collection occurred in groups of up to 15 participants
in a computer lab. Participants were instructed that they
would study word pairs that included one familiar word and
one unfamiliar word. They were instructed to study the
word pairs and type in the appropriate response during the
test trials. Each of the trials (study or test) was 8 s. with a
500 ms. intertrial interval. Participants had to spend the
entire 8 s. viewing the study screen, but during the test trials
they were allowed to press Enter to move on to the next trial
once they entered their response. If no response had been
entered within 8 s., the computer program automatically
advanced to the next trial. This task (142 trials) generally
took between 15 and 20 minutes for participants to
complete.
The final retention test tested participants on the 40
critical word pairs. Thirty-two of the participants took the
final test after 10 minutes, and 32 took the test after a 48
hour delay. Participants were instructed that they were
going to be tested on the words that they had learned
previously, and to type in the appropriate word pair. Each
trial was 14 s. (participants could press Enter to advance to
the next trial once they entered a response) and the
interstimulus interval was 500 ms. If no response had been
entered in, the computer program automatically advanced
after 14 seconds. This task generally took about 10 minutes
to complete.

Final Cued Recall
A 2 (delay) x 7 (spacing condition: 1-2-3; 1-5-9; 3-5-8; 58-13; 5-5-5; Single0; Single2) repeated measures ANOVA
was conducted on the final recall performance. Both the
within-subjects effect of spacing and the effect of delay
were significant; F (6, 89) = 25.45, p < .001, partial ?2=
.64, and F (1, 94) = 26.14, p < .001, partial ?2=.22,
respectively. The spacing by delay interaction was
marginally significant, F (6, 89) = 2.15, p = .06, partial ?2=
.07. As Table 2 shows, performance in the 5-8-13 condition
was the highest in both the immediate condition (although
not significantly) and was significantly higher than the other
spacing conditions (except for the 1-5-9 condition) after the
48 hour delay. The 5-5-5 spacing condition was not
significantly better than the other spacing conditions on
either the immediate or delayed test.

Results
Three separate analyses were conducted. The first analysis
investigated performance on the learning trials, that is, each
retrieval attempt during the expanding or evenly spaced
sequence. A second analysis was conducted on final cuedrecall performance. The third analysis investigated
forgetting between the last learning trial and the final cuedrecall test.

Forgetting
A 2 (retention interval) X 5 (spacing condition: 1-2-3; 15-9; 3-5-8; 5-8-13; 5-5-5) repeated measures ANOVA was
conducted on the amount of forgetting that occurred
between the final learning trial and the final test. There was
significantly more forgetting in the delayed condition than
the immediate condition, F (1, 94) =55.69, p < .001, partial
?2=.37. Forgetting also depended on the spacing condition,
F (4, 91) = 19.28, p < .001, partial ?2=.46, but there was no
interaction. Table 3 shows the amount of forgetting in each
condition. Comparing the 5-8-13 condition to the 5-5-5
condition, there was less forgetting on the immediate test
(although not significantly less), and significantly less
forgetting on the delayed final test, p = .001.

Discussion
Expanding retrieval can lead to better long term retention
than evenly spaced retrieval when a slight modification is
made to the original conceptualization of the method. Long
term retention is best when the learning trials are
constructed by combining a delayed initial retrieval attempt
with an expanding sequence for the remainder of the
learning trials. In accordance with Karpicke and Roediger
(2007), increasing the number of intervening items between
the study trial and the first retrieval attempt is critical to
improve learning and memory of the information.
Additionally, as the current experiment shows, it is also
critical for the sequence to expand for optimal long-term
retention.
Several findings from this experiment provide insight into
the conditions under which expanding retrieval will produce
better long term retention than evenly spaced retrieval. The
first relevant finding is, as stated above, the first retrieval
attempt after the study period must be sufficiently difficult.
Both of the spacing conditions that only had a single item
between study and retrieval produced high performance on
the initial retrieval attempt, but those conditions also saw a
large decline in performance across the learning trials. The
1-2-3 and 1-5-9 conditions, for example, both had a 10
percentage point drop in performance between the first and
third retrieval attempts. The conditions that were more
difficult and had at least three items between studying and
the first retrieval attempt had no forgetting across the
learning trials. Thus, increasing the difficultly of the first
retrieval attempt produced steady performance throughout

the learning trials. Maintaining a steady rate of performance
throughout learning may be important in preventing rapid
forgetting from occurring.
The next important finding was concerned with
forgetting in each of the conditions. Forgetting, as Tables 1
and 3 show, was quite rapid in the 1-2-3 and 1-5-9
conditions both during learning (as performance decreased
across learning trials) and during the final test retention
intervals. Although there was no forgetting across learning
trials for the sequences that began with a larger number of
intervening items, performance on the third and final
learning trial was still higher in the 1-2-3 and 1-5-9
conditions than the 3-5-8, 5-8-13 or 5-5-5 conditions.
However, on the final test given 10 minutes later, the 5-8-13
condition produced numerically better performance than the
other conditions, including the evenly spaced (5-5-5)
condition. This result was due to almost no forgetting in the
5-8-13 condition. This trend continued, and the 5-8-13
condition produced significantly better performance than
evenly spaced retrieval on the final test administered after a
48 hour retention interval. In this retention interval
condition, the 5-8-13 sequence produced half the amount of
forgetting as the 5-5-5 condition.
The 5-5-5- and 5-8-13 conditions were considered the
critical comparison in this study and addressed the question
of whether expanding retrieval can produce superior
performance on a long term retention test compared to
evenly spaced retrieval. On the learning trials, these two
conditions produced similar levels of performance. After a
10 minute retention interval the 5-8-13 condition produced
slightly better results, and after 48 hours, the 5-8-13
condition produced significantly better memory for the
word pairs than the 5-5-5 condition.
Thus far, the question of whether expanding retrieval can
produce superior performance compared to evenly spaced
retrieval on immediate and long term retention tests has
been mixed at best. In fact, equally spaced retrieval has
generally produced better performance than expanding
retrieval on tests taken at least 24 hours later. Karpicke and
Roediger (2007) even noted that, “we know of no existing
study using a continuous paired associate learning
task… that has shown that expanding retrieval produces
greater long-term retention (after delays greater than 24 hr)
than equally spaced practice.” The present experiment is
one that does show that expanding retrieval produces greater
long-term retention after 48 hours. Based on the current
results, it is not entirely surprising that the previous research
has been so mixed. Considering that a key factor in this
experiment was the difficulty of the initial retrieval attempt,
the 1-5-9 condition that has been used most widely is not a
sequence that would be expected to improve long term
retention. This also explains why the 5-5-5 condition,
which begins with a difficult initial retrieval attempt, has
produced such good performance in previous experiments.
The unique 5-8-13 expansion sequence, which combined
a difficult first retrieval attempt with expanding retrieval,
not only resulted in virtually no forgetting during both the

2126

learning trials and on a test administered after a 10 minute
retention interval. This particular sequence prevented the
rapid forgetting that normally occurs immediately after
learning takes place. Further, and of most importance to the
question at hand, is that the combination of a difficult initial
retrieval attempt and an expanding sequence resulted in half
the amount of forgetting on the long-term retention test
when compared to the evenly spaced control.
In summary, increasing the difficulty of the initial
retrieval attempt protects against rapid forgetting that can
occur within minutes of the study trial. This is evidenced by
the small amount of forgetting during learning and on the 10
minute retention interval test in both the 5-5-5 and the 5-813 conditions. However, expanding retrieval from a
difficult initial retrieval attempt produces better
performance on a final test 48 hours. Combining a difficult
initial retrieval attempt with even more difficult subsequent
attempts reduces the forgetting that normally occurs
immediately after learning (described by Ebbinghaus,
1885/1913; Rubin, Hinton & Wenzel, 1999) and up to 48
hours later.
