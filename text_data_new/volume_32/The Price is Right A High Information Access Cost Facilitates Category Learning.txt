It is not yet clear which resources are conserved as a
result of attentional optimization. One candidate is working
memory capacity: unattended object features are unlikely to
be stored in memory. There is, in fact, evidence that
working memory shares a close relationship with category
learning: those with low working memory spans are less
able to suppress task-irrelevant information, creating a need
for selective attention to fill the gap (Conway, Kane, &
Engle, 2003). Another resource that may be conserved is
time – attending only to what is necessary is likely to result
in a reduction in the amount of time required to categorize
something. In either view, attending to a particular feature
of an object incurs a cost – whether temporal or mnemonic –
and attentional optimization minimizes the cost incurred for
a successful categorization.
Hayhoe and colleagues (Ballard, Hayhoe, & Pelz, 1995;
Ballard, Hayhoe, Pook, & Rao, 1997; Droll & Hayhoe,
2007) provided empirical evidence of cost-benefit tradeoffs
in visual perception. When performing a task along the lines
of the Blocks World game (an interactive paradigm in which
subjects must duplicate a target image by positioning a
group of coloured boxes from a resource pool), participants
generally gather information from the environment as they
need it, minimizing the usage of short-term memory.
However, increasing the predictability of the task
encourages participants to save time by storing information
in memory: time, rather than memory capacity, becomes the
focus of their conservation efforts. Similar results were
found in a series of studies by Gray and colleagues, many of
which also employed the Blocks World paradigm (Gray &
Fu, 2004; Gray, Sims, Fu, & Scholles, 2006; Fu & Gray,
2006). When the target window was occluded by a
removable square, or participants were forced to make head
movements in addition to eye movements in order to direct
their gaze about the work area, there tended to be a switch to
a memory-intensive strategy in order to save time and
energy.
It appears that saving time is not the only advantage of
adopting a memory-based strategy in tasks along the lines of
Blocks World, although the evidence is not unequivocal.
Gray et al. (2006) found that participants in a memoryintensive variation of the Blocks World task made fewer
errors and mastered the task sooner than others performing a
standard task. While this contradicted earlier results by Gray
and Fu (2004), the results of Gray et al. (2006) are
supported by the research of Waldron and colleagues on
interface design (Waldron, Patrick, Howes, & Duggan,
2006; Waldron, Patrick, Morgan, & King, 2007; Morgan,
Patrick, Waldron, King, & Patrick, 2009). As in the Blocks

Abstract
Previous work in object categorization has shown that people
tend to optimize their allocation of attention to object
features, and suggests that attentional optimization may best
be explained in terms of cost-benefit tradeoffs. In support of
this idea, we found that implementing a cost for accessing
information about object features in a category learning task
facilitates both attentional optimization and category
acquisition, contrary to the predictions of existing models.
Keywords: category learning; categorization; access cost;
attentional learning; optimization.

An important component of proper psychological
functioning is the adaptive usage of limited resources. In
many situations, careful conservation of money, food, water,
memory capacity, and time can be vital to survival. The
choice of strategy for dealing with a particular issue depends
largely on the relative availability of the various resources
required – for instance, installing hardwood floors might be
best accomplished by doing it oneself if money is tight and
time is plentiful, while hiring a contractor might be a better
idea if money is no object but the job must be done quickly.
An optimal strategy for a given problem, then, balances
situational priorities (urgency, desire for quality) with
available resources (time, money).
This characterization of optimal strategy applies equally
to psychological domains such as categorization. Fiske and
Taylor (1984) characterized humans as cognitive misers,
meaning we will attempt to solve problems using the
smallest amount of mental resources possible. Indeed, a
good deal of evidence suggests that in category learning,
people learn to ignore irrelevant information, thereby
optimizing their allocation of attention for the task at hand
(Rehder & Hoffman, 2005; Blair, Watson, & Meier, 2009;
Blair, Watson, Walshe, & Maj, 2009; Blair, Chen, et al.,
2009). The process of selectively allocating attentional
resources to task-relevant information is labeled attentional
optimization.
One approach to characterizing the optimal usage of
attentional resources takes the view that the benefits of
attending to a piece of information must outweigh the costs.
This view of attentional optimization as a process of costbenefit tradeoffs parallels some of the decisions made in the
domain of medical diagnosis. A doctor attempting to
diagnose a patient will order only tests which are necessary,
and even then will strike a balance between efficacy, cost,
and safety. A doctor who suspects a particular condition
may be more likely to order a cheap, safe blood test than
expensive, dangerous exploratory surgery.

World literature, Waldron and colleagues found that an
increased information access cost leads to a change in
information-gathering strategy in a variety of different
paradigms. Implementing a time delay for accessing
information on the target encourages the usage of
memorization, in contrast to the default strategy of scanning
back and forth (Waldron et al., 2006). This strategic shift
was found to be beneficial to memory for particular system
states, general understanding of the system, competence in
the absence of available information (Waldron et al., 2007),
and the ability to fluently resume a task after interruption
(Patrick et al., 2009), though it has its costs in the form of
increased response time (Waldron et al., 2006).
While the above research suggests that there are some
benefits (and some penalties) resulting from a shift toward
memory-based strategies in response to increased
information access costs, it is not yet clear whether
increased attentional optimization is one of them. None of
the studies by Waldron and colleagues involved the
presence of irrelevant information. This is not surprising, as
interface design tends to avoid including irrelevant data in a
display; however, in object categorization it is often vitally
important to be able to divert one’s attention away from
unimportant information (e.g. Rehder & Hoffman, 2005).
In spite of the evidence regarding the importance of costbenefit considerations in the allocation of attention, it is
possible (and, until recently, routine) to develop a coherent
model of attentional optimization without making any
mention of costs. Computational models of category
learning, such as ALCOVE (Kruschke, 1992), simply shift
attention away from irrelevant information and towards
relevant information. However, in a disease diagnosis
paradigm, Matsuka and Corter (2008) found that
participants appeared optimize attention in a way consistent
with a sensitivity to cost-benefit considerations. When
presented with stimuli with two different features which
perfectly and redundantly predicted category membership,
people attended to only one of them. The idea of attentional
optimization as a cost-benefit tradeoff explains this result
quite well: the benefit of viewing one feature far outweighs
the cost of accessing it, while the second feature provides no
additional information to offset its access cost and is thus
ignored.
If attentional optimization is indeed based partially on
cost-benefit considerations, then the degree to which people
optimize their attention should depend on the additional cost
incurred in attending to irrelevant features. A high
information access cost should provide more motivation to
avoid the waste of time or resources associated with
attending to irrelevant information, increasing the rate of
attentional optimization. In contrast, optimizing one’s
attention would provide only a minimal benefit in a
situation in which accessing information is nearly or entirely
free, and as such may be less of a priority for those who are
able to master the task.
All other things being equal, then, a category learning
task with a high information access cost should result in

more attentional optimization than a task with a low or
nonexistent access cost. In addition, implementing a high
access cost should encourage the use of a memory-based
strategy, resulting in improved learning. The present
experiment sought to test these hypotheses using the stimuli
and category structure from Experiment 2 of Blair, Watson,
Walshe, and Maj (2009). Since the stimuli involved three
spatially separate features, we were able to manipulate
access cost by obscuring the features with overlays and
implementing a variable time cost to remove them.

Method
Participants
149 undergraduate students from Simon Fraser University
students participated in exchange for course credit in
introductory Psychology classes.

Apparatus
The computer program used in the present experiment was
developed using E-Prime 1.1 (Psychology Software Tools),
and was run on four Apple iMac computers running
Windows XP. Responses were made using the computer
mouse.

Design
The present experiment consisted of a supervised category
learning task. Participants were shown computer-generated
pictures of fictitious microorganisms (see Figure 1) and
asked to categorize them as members of one of four
different species. The microorganisms (following Blair,
Watson, Walshe, and Maj, 2009), varied on three binary
organelle-like features, each located in a distinct area of the
cell. One organelle looked like either a muscle or a thin
tube, another was a mitochondrion-like structure with either

buttons in the corners of the screen. The subject has
revealed the top right feature by moving the mouse over it,
while the other two are still occluded by overlays.

two or four internal compartments, and the third resembled
an iris and pupil with either a green or a brownish
coloration. Each feature occupied its own lobule of the cell,
evenly distributed around the screen and counterbalanced
across subjects.
There were four possible category labels for each
stimulus: A1, A2, B1, and B2. One feature was always
relevant, and determined whether the stimulus was a
member of an A category or a B category. Of the two
remaining features, one determined whether an A stimulus
was A1 or A2, and the other determined whether a B
stimulus was B1 or B2. Thus, only one of the two was
relevant on any given trial, and the identity of the first
feature informed the participant of which of the other
features would be relevant (see Table 1). Feature relevance
was counterbalanced across subjects, and category labels
were assigned randomly according to the structure described
above.

structure well enough to provide 25 consecutive correct
answers immediately proceeded to a 72-trial transfer phase
where corrective feedback was not provided. Those who
were unable to reach this criterion point by the 200th trial
did not proceed to transfer. There was no time restriction on
the experiment; participants were free to spend as long as
desired on each trial. While there was some individual
variation in completion times, the entire experiment took
approximately 45 minutes to complete.

Procedure
Following a brief introduction to the experimental task,
participants began a series of supervised categorization
trials. A stimulus was presented, with its three variable
features covered up by noisy square-like overlays. In order
to remove an overlay and see the feature underneath,
participants were required to hold the mouse on top of it for
a predetermined period of time.
Participants were randomly assigned to a high-cost or
low-cost condition. In the no-delay (low-cost) condition, the
overlays disappeared instantly; in contrast, participants in
the delay (high-cost) condition had to hold the mouse on top
of an overlay for a full 3000ms before the feature was
revealed. During this interval, the overlay was replaced by a
black box marked “SCANNING…” In either condition,
upon moving the mouse away from the revealed feature, the
overlay would instantly reappear. The position of the mouse
was tracked and recorded over the course of the experiment.
Thus, at most one feature was available for viewing at one
time. This allowed for a sensitive and dynamic measure of
attentional allocation, similar to that of eye-tracking, and
prevented participants in the delay condition from using the
additional wait time to inspect other features.
Immediately after participants responded, they were
presented with corrective feedback and were able to reinspect stimulus features, with the same overlay restrictions
as before, if they so desired.
By default the experiment lasted for 200 such
categorization trials. An early learning criterion was
implemented such that participants who learned the category

Results
20 participants were excluded due to computer errors or
random responding, leaving 65 participants in the no-delay
condition and 64 in the delay condition. The no-delay
condition produced 45 learners and 20 non-learners,
compared to 49 learners and 15 non-learners in the delay
condition. This did not constitute a statistically significant
difference, χ2(1) = .877, p > .30. Among those who were
able to learn the category structure, however, participants in
the delay condition reached criterion accuracy significantly
earlier (M = 57.5 trials) than those in the no-delay condition
(M = 76.2), t(92) = 2.37, p < .05 (see Figure 2).
We calculated attentional optimization scores for each
trial following the formula used in the eye-tracking
experiments of Blair, Watson, Walshe, and Maj (2009):
𝑋𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡 − 𝑋𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡
𝑋𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣 𝑎𝑛𝑡
This amounts to a comparison of the average length of
time spent attending to relevant versus irrelevant features,
where 𝑋𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡 is the total time during which relevant
features were visible divided by the number of relevant
features and 𝑋𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡 is the total time during which
irrelevant features were visible divided by the number of
irrelevant features. Our measure of attentional optimization
thus ranged from -1 (fixating only irrelevant features) to 0

partial-mediation relationship. Access cost contributed to
optimization both indirectly (via earlier learning) and
directly.
Finally, we suspected that the time course of optimization
may have differed between conditions – it is possible that a
long delay encouraged earlier optimization, but participants
in the no-delay condition may have caught up later on in the
experiment. To investigate this possibility, we calculated
each learner’s mean optimization scores before and after
their criterion point. A 2 (pre-criterion/post-criterion) x 2
(delay/no-delay) mixed ANOVA revealed no interactive
effect of stage and delay on optimization, F(1,92) = .106, p
> .70, suggesting that attentional learning was uniform over
the course of the experiment in both conditions.

Discussion
Figure 3: Mean optimization in the first 110 trials by
condition. Error bars represent SEM.

The results of the present work indicate that increasing
the temporal cost of accessing information contributes not
only to improved category learning, but also to more
optimal allocation of attention. Learners in the high-cost
delay condition reached the learning criterion earlier than
those in the no-delay condition, and displayed greater
attentional optimization over the course of the experiment.
These findings support the counterintuitive idea that making
information access more difficult improves multiple aspects
of performance, extending earlier findings in diseasediagnosis (Matsuka & Corter, 2008) and interface design
(Waldron et al., 2007). Taken together, this body of research
provides compelling evidence for the validity of the
conception of attentional optimization as a balancing act
between costs and benefits.
In addition to cost-benefit considerations, one potential
contributor to the improved learning in the presence of a
high temporal access cost is the fact that such a cost
encourages a strict sequential progression of attention. In
recalling the positions of objects in space (Yamamoto &
Shelton, 2009), as well as in recalling lists of words or
letters (Frick, 1985; Goolkasian, Foos, & Krusemark, 2008),
performance is significantly improved when information is
presented sequentially rather than simultaneously. When
access cost is low, participants are able to switch their
attention back and forth as they please; in contrast, a high
access cost discourages jumping back and forth between
costly pieces of information and promotes a strategy of
sequential attention.
Somewhat unexpectedly, in spite of the earlier criterion
point among learners in the high-cost condition, there was
not a concomitant difference in the number of learners. This
may be an issue of motivation: while the increased access
cost appears to facilitate learning by encouraging the use of
memory-based strategies, participants in the delay condition
may have become frustrated with the inconvenience of
having to wait for features to become visible and applied
less effort as a result. This possibility may be a fruitful topic
for future research. Further investigation in this area may
also benefit from some variance in the number of trials
given to reach criterion; in the present study, participants in

(equal time spent fixating all features) to 1 (fixating only
relevant features). Over the course of the experiment,
subjects in the delay condition displayed significantly
greater optimization (M = 0.623) than those in the no-delay
condition (M = 0.520), t(92) = 2.193, p < .05.
Since the delay condition resulted in faster learning and
thus an earlier end to the experiment, we elected to examine
optimization between conditions over a set number of trials
as an alternative comparison between conditions. We
calculated the mean optimization over the first 110 trials
(the approximate length of the shortest experimental run) for
each successful learner. In this trial range, participants in the
delay condition displayed a mean optimization score of .531
(SD .281), compared to .355 (SD .245) for the no-delay
condition. This was a significant difference, t(92) = 3.34, p
< .01 (see Figure 3).
As attentional optimization has been known to occur after
categorization errors cease (Blair, Watson, & Meier, 2009),
it is possible that the contribution of access cost to
optimization in the first 110 trials was purely a product of
the earlier learning criterion in the delay condition. With
more error-free time to optimize, a greater degree of
optimization would not be surprising. To examine whether
access cost had an effect on optimization independent of its
contribution to early accuracy, we performed a mediation
analysis using the hierarchical multiple-regression
techniques described by Baron and Kenny (1986). Having
already demonstrated an association between access cost
and criterion point (see Figure 2) and a connection between
access cost and optimization in the first 110 trials (see
Figure 3), we performed a hierarchical multiple regression
analysis predicting early optimization from criterion point in
the first step, and adding delay condition as a new predictor
in the second. Criterion point proved to be a significant
negative predictor of optimization, β = -.777, t(92) = -11.85,
p < .001, as expected. Condition, when added to the model,
contributed to optimization even after controlling for
criterion point, β = .140, t(91) = 2.11, p < .05, indicating a

239

both conditions were given 200, a number far in excess of
the mean number of trials to criterion (58 for delay, 76 for
no-delay).
The practical implications of the present research for
training in interface design and related fields are obvious:
implementing an access cost can in certain circumstances
facilitate learning. However, caution should be taken, as a
high temporal access cost can greatly reduce the temporal
efficiency of a training period. While a subject might learn a
particular system in fewer trials with a high access cost, the
cost may make each trial so long that the net effect is
ultimately more time spent on training. If it holds true that
the learning advantage that comes with an increased access
cost is largely the product of a shift toward memory-based
strategies, there is probably a point beyond which increasing
access cost confers no additional benefit. In addition, there
may be more practical ways of encouraging the adoption of
memorization strategies, such as only presenting
information for a short period of time (Waldron et al., 2006)
or implementing a non-temporal cost, such as money,
tokens, or effort.
Within the field of category learning, researchers have
long focused on tasks where all of the relevant information
is immediately and simultaneously available to categorizers.
Learning, according to the major models, is in most cases
exclusively based on the accuracy of the response (e.g.
ALCOVE; Kruschke, 1992). This is because they were
designed around a specific event – the categorization trial –
rather than around the dynamic unfolding of the task
through time (though see Lamberts, 2002). While this has
been a helpful simplification, it is becoming increasingly
untenable in the face of dynamic measures of attention such
as eye- and mouse-tracking (Rehder & Hoffman, 2005;
Blair, Watson, Walshe, & Maj, 2009), as well as a number
of results indicating a level of complexity untouched by the
current generation of computational models. The time spent
waiting for stimuli to appear can have implications for
strategy selection and memory performance (Morgan et al.,
2009), the information participants choose to access
depends on which information was previously accessed
during the trials (Blair, Watson, Walshe, & Maj, 2009), and
the length of time spent viewing feedback impacts learning
speed (Watson & Blair, 2008). Investigations of missing
data (White & Koehler, 2004; Wood & Blair, 2010), tasks
which present new sources of information (Blair & Homa,
2005), and studies of the speed of perceptual processing of
features (Lamberts, 2003) are further evidence that the
amount and order of known information exerts a
considerable influence on the course of category learning.
These and other temporal effects on learning and
performance are accumulating and will eventually force
researchers to embed extant theoretical work in a dynamic,
temporal framework in order to account for them.
