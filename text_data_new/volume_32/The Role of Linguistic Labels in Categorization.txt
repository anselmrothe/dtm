Abstract

grouped objects taxonomically (e.g., the police car
with a passenger car). Gelman and Heyman (1999)
demonstrated that young children were more willing
to generalize properties from one person to another
when both persons were referred to by a noun (i.e.,
"carrot-eaters") than when both were referred to by a
descriptive sentence (e.g., "both like to eat carrots").
This evidence, however, does not lend unequivocal
support to the idea that labels have to be category
markers to make inductive inferences. For example,
some researchers suggested that contribution of
labels is driven by attentional rather than conceptual
factors (Napolitano & Sloutsky, 2004; Sloutsky &
Napolitano 2003). There is also evidence that labels
contribute to the overall similarity of compared
entities and thus to both categorization and induction
(Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004). Sloutsky and Fisher
(2004) also demonstrated that similarity computed
over labels and appearances can accurately predict
young children’s responses with the Gelman and E.
Markman (1986) task. These findings suggest that
reliance on labels does not necessarily indicate that
labels are more than features.
In a series of studies, Yamauchi and A. Markman
(1998, 2000) designed a paradigm that could address
this issue directly. Specifically, they compared
participants’ performance on classification tasks (e.g.,
is X a dax?) with that on induction tasks (e.g., given
that X is a dax, does it have Y?). The tasks are
structurally identical, except a critical difference. In
the classification task participants predicted the
category label of an item given all of its feature
values. In contrast, in the induction task, participants
predicted the value of a missing feature of an item
given its category label and other feature values.
These researchers argued that if the label is a feature
then performance on classification and induction task
should be symmetrical. However, if labels are more
than features, then performance on induction tasks
should be better than performance on classification

Do young children treat labels as features or as category
markers? The current study addressed this question by
examining the effect of labels on young children's
classification and induction. The first experiment replicated
previous study on adults demonstrating that adults treat labels
as category markers. The other two experiments applied the
same paradigm to young children. Children were trained by
classification in Experiment 2A and by induction in
Experiment 2B, whereas both experiments used the
classification and induction tasks that were identical to those
in Experiment 1. The results from the three experiments
indicated that adults treated labels as category markers,
whereas no such evidence was found for young children.

Introduction
The ability to use linguistic labels to generalize from the
known to the unknown is crucial for learning new
information. Although a substantial body of experimental
evidence has demonstrated that label has an impact on
categorization and induction processes (Gelman & E.
Markman, 1986; Sloutsky, Lo, & Fisher, 2001; Welder &
Graham, 2001; Yamauchi and A. Markman, 1998, 2000),
the mechanism underlying the role of labels is hotly
debated. Are labels used as features (similar to other
objects’ properties) or as category markers representing
category membership? This issue is particularly
contentious with respect to the role of labels in early
development and developmental changes in this role.
Some researchers have argued that labels are more than
features. According to this view, labels are category
markers used for representing a category. For example, E.
Markman and Hutchinson (1984) found that children
regarded words presented as count nouns changed the
way young children grouped objects. Without labels
children grouped objects thematically (e.g., a police car
was grouped with a policeman), whereas when the same
police car was referred to by a count noun, children

tasks. Upon finding predicted asymmetries between the
two conditions (i.e., participants were better at using the
label to predict other features than at using other features
to predict the label), these researchers concluded that
participants are more likely to regard labels as category
markers instead of object features.
However, this paradigm has not been applied to
children. Does the asymmetry found in adults exist in
children? Finding such an asymmetry would support the
idea that labels are more than category features, whereas a
symmetric performance in the classification and induction
conditions would support the idea that labels are features.
The primary goal of this study is to address these
questions.
The current study consists of three experiments.
Experiment 1 replicated Yamauchi and A. Markman’s
paradigm (2000) with adults. Based on their findings, it
was hypothesized that adults would regard labels as
category markers. Experiments 2A and 2B, using
comparable learning and testing conditions, examined
how labels would affect young children’s performance.

Figure 1. The prototypes of stimuli used in this study.
Stimuli	   The stimuli were artificial creatures
accompanied by a category label ("Flurp" of "Jalet")
and two categories of objects that were created using
five features varying in color and shape (see Figure
1). As shown in Table 1 and 2, the two categories
have a family-resemblance structure, which is
derived from two prototypes (F0 and J0) by
modifying the values of one of five features. For
example, to produce the stimulus F1, the value of the
antenna is changed from 1 to 0 so that it has four
features consistent with the prototype F0 and one
feature consistent with the prototype J0. The degree
of similarity between test stimulus and the prototype
is defined by the number of matching features of the
test stimulus to the prototype of the corresponding
category (Table 1 and 2).

Experiment 1
Method

Participants Sixteen adults participated in this
experiment. Participants were undergraduate student from
the Ohio State University participating for course credit.
Three of them gave one type of response to over 95% of
all trials. Their data were excluded from the analysis due
to the response bias.

Note. High and low are two levels of feature match. F = Flurp; J = Jalet. Category-accordance responses were the ones consistent with the values
indicated in the target features and target labels.

Proportion of categoryaccordance responses

Similar to Yamauchi and A. Markman, there are two
levels of similarity (or feature match) in current research:
high and low. At the high level of feature match, each test
stimulus has four features in common with the prototype
of the corresponding category and one feature in common
with the prototype of the contrasting category. Similarly,
each test stimulus at the low level of feature match has
two features in common with the prototype of the
corresponding category and three features in common
with the prototype of the other category.

Procedure The entire experiment consisted of two
phases, learning and testing. During the learning phase,
participants were instructed that they should try to
remember and distinguish two groups of artificial
creatures represented by the labels "Flurp" and "Jalet".
And then participants were presented with 36 trials of
creatures produced from stimulus structure shown in
Table 1 and each stimulus had a correspondent label
above it.
The testing phase was administered immediately after
the learning phase. The Classification and Induction
conditions differed in the type of features being predicted.
In the Classification condition, participants predicted the
category label of a stimulus given information about all
five features with the label covered. In the Induction
condition, participants predicted the value of one of five
features given the other four features with the label
uncovered. The classification question was phrased as
"Which group do you think this creature is more likely to
belong to, Flurp or Jalet?" The induction question was
phrased as "Which antenna do you think this creature is
more likely to have?" The order of the testing trials was
randomized for each subject. Feedback was given in first
6 trials of each condition. No feedback in other 40 trials in
both conditions. The proportion of responses in
accordance with the category from which the exemplar
was derived (called "category-accordance responses" by
Yamauchi & A. Markman, 2000, see Table 2) was the
dependent variable.

tasks in Experiment 1.
The results replicate Yamauchi and A. Markman
(2000) pointing to the predicted asymmetry and
suggesting that for adults labels are more than objects
features. In Experiment 2, we expand this paradigm
to young children.

Experiment 2A
Method
Participants There were thirteen preschool children
(6 boys and 7 girls) with an average age of 55.8
months participating in this experiment. They were
given Classification learning. In Classification
learning, children were presented with all five
features of a creature and told that it was a Flurp (or
Jalet). A memory check was administered after main
experiment to examine whether participants could
remember the stimuli and correspondent labels.
Children were given 5 trials in memory check by
presenting a creature and asking them which group
this creature came from. One of them answered less
than 3 out 5 memory check questions correctly and
these data were excluded from the analysis.

Results and Discussion
The main results of Experiment 1 are shown in Figure
2. The data were analyzed with 2 (testing type:
Classification and Induction) × 2 (feature match: high and
low) analysis of variance (ANOVA). There was a main
effect of feature match, F(1,12) = 165.39, MSE = 0.89, p
< 0.01, as well as an interaction between testing type and
feature match, F(1,12) = 38.61, MSE =0.32, p < 0.01. At
the low level of feature match, category-accordance
responses made in the Induction condition were more than
in the Classification condition, t(12) = 4.88, p < 01.
However, there was no significant difference in these two
testing types at the high level of feature match, t(12) =
2.12, p > 0.05.

Stimuli and procedure The visual stimuli were
identical to Experiment 1 (see Figure 1). The entire
experiment consisted of two phases, classification
learning phase and testing phase. During
classification learning, in contrast to Experiment 1
with adults, children were instructed that there were
two groups of creatures, Flurp and Jalet. And then
they were trained by presenting creatures with
category labels and told:" This is a Flurp (or Jalet)."

Experiment 2B
Method
Participants There were fourteen preschool children
(8 boys and 6 girls) with an average age of 54.00
months in this experiment. They were given
Induction learning. In contrast to the children trained
by classification in Experiment 2A, children in this
experiment were trained by induction in which they
were presented all five features of a creature and told
that the creature had a Flurp (or Jalet) inside its body.
A memory check, identical to Experiment 2B, was
administered after main experiment to examine
whether participants could remember the stimuli and
correspondent labels. Two of them answered less
than 3 out 5 memory check questions correctly and
these data were excluded from the analysis.

Feature Match

Figure 3. Performance for classification and induction
tasks in Experiment 2A.

Stimuli and procedure The visual stimuli were
identical to previous experiments. The entire
experiment consisted of two phases, induction
learning phase and testing phase. During induction
learning, in contrast to Experiment 2A, children were
instructed that there were two groups of creatures and
something special was inside each group of creatures.
One group of creatures had Flurp while another
group had Jalet. And then they were trained by
presenting creatures and told:" This one has a Flurp
(or Jalet)." The testing phase was identical to
Experiment 2B.

The testing phase was identical to Experiment 1 except
how the questions were asked. Unlike the adults
participants in Experiment 1 who read the questions
presented on screen, children were asked both
classification and induction questions by a female
experimenter.

Results and Discussion
The main results of Experiment 2A are shown in Figure
3. The data were analyzed with 2 (testing type:
Classification and Induction) × 2 (feature match: high and
low) analysis of variance (ANOVA), with testing type
and feature match as within-subjects factors. There was a
main effect of feature match, F(1,11) = 43.56, MSE =
1.33, p < 0.01, as well as a main effect of testing type,
F(1,11) = 14.77, MSE = 0.16, p < 0.01. However, unlike
adults in Experiment 1, there was no significant
interaction between testing type and feature match,
F(1,11) = 0.02, MSE = 0.00, p > 0.10.
Children in Experiment 2A, unlike adults in
Experiment 1, made more category-accordance responses
on classification questions than on induction questions at
both high and low level of feature match. These results
indicate that, if anything, the Classification condition
elicited better performance than the Induction condition.
These results present little evidence that young children
treated labels as category markers.
However, the learning type, in this experiment using
classification learning, might have a facilitative effect on
children's classification. In Experiment 2B, we explored
the impact of learning type on children's performance in

Results and Discussion
The main results of Experiment 2B are shown in
Figure 4. The data were analyzed with 2 (testing
type: Classification and Induction) × 2 (feature
match: high and low) ANOVA, with testing type and
feature match as within-subjects factors. There was a
main effect of feature match, F(1,16) = 86.84, MSE =
2.50, p < 0.01. In contrast to Experiment 2A, children
in this experiment did not differ in the two testing
types, F(1,11) = 3.90, MSE = 0.03, p > 0.05.
These results, compared to Experiment 2A,
suggest that there was an effect of learning type and
the induction learning facilitated children's
performance on the induction questions. However,
children's performance, similar to Experiment 2A,
was symmetric in both testing conditions and there
was no evidence that children treated differently
induction and classification questions.

according to some accounts, even early in
development linguistic labels words affect
categorization and inductive inference by marking
the underlying category (e.g., Gelman & Heyman,
1999; Gelman & Markman, 1986). According to
other accounts, early in development linguistic labels
are features of entities. As a result, when two entities
share a label, young children may perceive these
entities as being more similar than when no labels are
introduced (Sloutsky, et al, 2001; Sloutsky & Fisher,
2004). Yamauchi and A. Markman (1998, 2000)
developed a procedure enabling the distinction
between these accounts. This procedure, however,
was never used with young children.
Our results with young children support the latter
account, while generating little evidence that young
children treat labels as category markers. In addition,
although current research does not conclusively
eliminate the possibility that for young children
linguistic labels are category markers, it demonstrates
that the role of linguistic labels changes in the course
of development.

General Discussion

Acknowledgments

The results point to two main findings. First, there was
an effect of learning. Children had better performance on
classification questions when they were trained by
classification (Experiment 2A). At the same time, when
they were trained by induction (Experiment 2B), their
performance on induction questions became equivalent to
that on classification questions and there was no
significant difference between these two testing types.
And more importantly, there were marked
developmental differences in the role of linguistic labels.
Adults exhibited better performance in inferring a feature
by using a label than inferring a label by using features.
These findings are consistent with previous research
(Yamauchi & A. Markman, 2000) and suggest that adult
may have used labels as category markers. However,
labels had little facilitative effect on children’s
performance – their performance was equivalent whether
they were asked to predict labels on the basis of other
features (i.e., the classification condition) or to predict a
feature on the basis of the label (i.e., the induction
condition). Furthermore, regardless of the type of learning
(i.e., Classification or Induction), children, in contrast to
adults' asymmetry, consistently exhibited a symmetric
pattern on classification and induction questions (see
Figure 3 and 4). These results suggest that while labels
may be different from category features for adults, this is
not the case for young children.
These results have important implications for
understanding of inter-relationships between language
and cognition, and specifically the role of linguistic labels
in categorization and category learning. Recall that
