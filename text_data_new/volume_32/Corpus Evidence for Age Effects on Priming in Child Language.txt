since children’s only input to language acquisition is the lexical expressions that they hear. Tomasello’s (2000) itembased hypothesis proposes that children’s early language consists of word-for-word chunks copied from adults’ phrases,
from which they only gradually abstract patterns and therefore grammar rules. An alternative view is that all children
are born with a universal grammar (Chomsky, 1980); this
theory suggests that abstract grammatical knowledge is innate in the human brain, and merely needs to be parametrized
during the course of language acquisition.
This paper explores the item-based hypothesis by studying structural priming in corpora of child language. If a
child adapts to structural priming—that is, the child shows
a tendency to reuse syntactic constructions heard or produced
recently—then this indicates that the child is using old syntactic representations to express new ideas with different words.
The item-based hypothesis predicts that this behavior should
increase with the age of the child: if syntactic development
is a gradual shift from lexically dominant phrase repetition
towards generalized grammatical rules, then structural priming should be more frequent in older children, who have more
abstract syntactic representations available.
In a well-studied phenomenon called lexical boost, structural repetition rises when the target and the prime share a
content word, i.e., lexical adaptation boosts structural adaptation (Pickering & Ferreira, 2008). We hypothesize that if
grammatical abstraction is thought of as curtailing reliance
on words, then priming may show decreased effects of lexical boost as children age.
In this paper, we test both hypotheses: that overall priming
increases with age, and that the lexical boost effect decreases
with age.

Abstract
Structural priming, the tendency to repeat previously uttered
syntactic structures, can give insight into human language processing and acquisition. We report two corpus-based studies
of children’s structural priming that test the following claim of
the item-based account of language acquisition: as older children generalize over structures, priming increases with age. A
hypothesis derived from this claim, viz., that the lexical boost
effect decreases with age, is also tested. We fit mixed-effects
logistic regression models on data from children aged 2 to 7.5
years from the CHILDES corpus. We demonstrate structural
priming of arbitrary syntactic structures for the first time in
child language data. We also find evidence that priming increases with age, but fail to confirm the hypothesis that the
lexical boost effect decreases with age.

Introduction
Priming occurs when an initial stimulus, called the prime,
causes a bias towards a related stimulus later on. Adaptation
to the prime manifests itself in the latter stimulus, the target, which is comprehended faster or more accurately, or produced more frequently. A wide range of priming effects has
been documented, including the priming of words, syntactic
structures, and discourse patterns. The phenomenon is neither
intentional nor conscious (Bock & Loebell, 1990). Establishing which aspects of a linguistic stimulus adapt to priming—
and which ones do not—gives insight into the mental representation of language and the process by which speakers
comprehend and produce sentences.
The vast majority of priming research has been carried out
with adults, but there are some recent studies that investigate priming in children (e.g., Savage, Lieven, Theakston, &
Tomasello, 2003; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, & Shimpi, 2004;
Kemp, Lieven, & Tomasello, 2005). Such studies make it
possible to examine the development of linguistic representations, based on how priming effects change over the time
course of language acquisition, i.e., with the age of the child.
Priming can therefore be used as a tool to test specific questions about human language acquisition.
One of the key questions in language acquisition is whether
grammatical rules are acquired conjointly with individual
words or, alternatively, syntactic knowledge is abstract from
lexical knowledge. In the latter case, the question arises of the
source of knowledge of the abstract structure of a language,

Background
Many experimental studies create an atypical context of language use, requiring the participant to respond to a number of
similar trials, where the high repetition of trials may condition
participants to become more practiced in their responses, or
alternatively, participants may show fatigue. Priming studies,
in particular, often present made-up nonce words and observe
participants’ comprehension or use of them (e.g., Brooks &
Tomasello, 1999; Kemp et al., 2005). Teaching a participant a
novel word requires multiple exposures which means multiple primes, and it is not clear what effect additive priming

might have. Likewise, several priming experiments, especially with children (e.g., Savage et al., 2003; Kemp et al.,
2005; Huttenlocher et al., 2004), entail both hearing and then
repeating every prime, again double-priming all targets. Corpus studies are not subject to these confounds, and they can
help verify that a phenomenon observed in a few children in a
few contexts can be generalized to child language as a whole.
With few exceptions, experimental and corpus studies alike
have looked for priming of a small set of specific syntactic
alternations—different syntactic forms that express the same
semantics—providing very limited coverage of grammar. Recent corpus studies have overcome this limitation, and have
found that priming is a more general phenomenon (Reitter,
Moore, & Keller, 2006; Reitter, 2008), and that less frequent
structures show more priming that more frequent ones (the
inverse frequency effect).
In the current paper, we present the first corpus-based investigation of priming in children. In the first of two studies,
we replicate an experimental study of the priming of passive
and active constructions in children (Savage et al., 2003). Our
second study generalizes these results by modeling adaptation
to the priming of arbitrary structures. The studies bear on the
item-based hypothesis of language acquisition. In particular,
we investigate the role of a child’s age as a predictor of priming, and consider the influence of lexical similarity.

vised taggers (MacWhinney, 2000). This is in turn used to
generate labeled dependency structures based on grammatical relations between words (Sagae, Lavie, & MacWhinney,
2005). Sagae et al. evaluate the dependency hierarchy accuracy to be 90.1% on child language transcripts.

Mixed-Effects Logistic Regression
We used mixed-effects logistic regression to identify which
variables influence priming in our corpus. Our dependent
variable Y is a binary variable that indicates whether there
is structural repetition between two sentences (Y = TRUE) or
not (Y = FALSE). Logistic regression is a generalization of linear regression that predicts the logit of the probability p that
Y is TRUE, as a function of explanatory variables X1 . . . XN :
logit (p) = β0 + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + ... + βN XN .

Mixed-effects regression allows the optional inclusion of random effects in order to generalize beyond the groups represented in a limited statistical sample. Modeling random effects allows for the possibility that, say, different children
have different repetition behaviors, or that each child’s repetition behavior changes in different ways as he or she gets
older. In the first example, a random effect variable C HILD
would be defined to model trends that are specific to each one
of its grouping factors: Abe, Abigail, Adam, Allison, etc.
For each possible value g of the random-effects grouping
variable, let αg be the deviation of the dependent variable’s
mean for group g from the entire dataset’s mean; αg is a random variable from a normal distribution with a mean of zero
and unknown variance. αg is added to each datum taken from
group g, effectively adjusting the intercept of regression independently for each group so that uncontrolled effects specific
to each group do not unfairly distort the overall model.

Modeling Methodology
We used mixed-effects logistic regression to model how various explanatory variables affect structural repetition between
pairs of sentences from the CHILDES corpus.

Data
The CHILDES corpus (MacWhinney, 2000) contains over
100 databases of transcriptions of face-to-face interactions
between young children and their caretakers. The corpus studies described in this paper used a subset of these
databases that contain multiple interviews with a child over
different dates, so that priming could be compared at different
ages of the same child.1 For naturalness, the phrase “the corpus” will refer to this subset of CHILDES. The corpus comprises utterances from 84 child speakers, as well as speech
from their adult interlocutors.
The most current collection of CHILDES transcripts as of
April 17, 2009 was processed to remove structures containing unrecognized words, babble, test words, and fillers (onomatopoeia and child-invented word forms that could be recognized were kept). Certain types of clitics were separated
to correspond with morphosyntactic annotations (e.g., they’ll
⇒ they will), as were assimilations (e.g., wanta ⇒ want to).
Disfluencies, retracings, and repetitions were kept.
CHILDES includes annotations of morphemes and syntactic categories, which are automatically generated by super-

Model Specification and Fitting
In the corpus studies reported here, we fitted mixed models
with random intercepts grouped by the child speaker of target
utterances, which were further nested by database to account
for random effects of different annotators, interview strategies, etc. In Study 2, random intercepts were also defined
for the syntactic structure being investigated in each datum,
which is particularly important because the frequencies of the
structures vary greatly, approximating a Zipf distribution.
The corpus data is strongly biased towards younger children, with relatively few utterances from children above five
years old. Unlike natural cases of sparsity (e.g., spoken language uses far fewer passive sentences than active ones) the
sparsity of data for older children is an artifact of CHILDES.
Still, it presents a potential problem, as the model-fitting algorithms had to deal with higher variance for older children.

1 The subset comprised the following databases: Bloom73,
Brown, Demetras1, Demetras2, Feldman, Gathercole Gleason,
Kuczaj, MacWhinney, Sachs, Suppes, Wells. The Wells database
contains British English; all the others contain American English.

Models were fit using Laplace’s method by the lme4 software package for the R programming environment. All explanatory variables were centered around the mean to reduce
multicollinearity between higher-order interactions and their
constituent main effects. We built minimal models by dropping non-significant explanatory variables (unless explicitly
relevant to the experiment, or necessary as the component of
a significant higher-order interaction).

Study 1: Priming of Active and Passive Voice
To confirm that mixed-model regression analysis of corpus
data can provide an insight into structural priming similar to
what can be accomplished in experiments, we replicated an
experimental design utilized by Savage et al. (2003) and compared the qualitative results of the two methods.
The experiment of Savage et al. (2003, experiment 1) proceeded as follows: In interviews with 84 children from age
2;11 to 7;1 (years; months), children heard and repeated a
prime sentence—either active or passive—describing some
transitive action depicted in a cartoon. Then they were shown
another cartoon of a different action with different participants and asked “What’s happening?”. The target sentences
the children produced in response were classified as PASSIVE or
ACTIVE. Experimenters also varied the amount of lexical overlap that the child could potentially find between the given
prime sentence and the child-produced target.

a mixed-effects logistic regression model where the voice of
the target sentence was predicted by the following main effects and their interactions:

Method

• P RIME: the voice of the prime utterance (ACTIVE or PASSIVE);

All sentences in the specified subset of the CHILDES corpus (see Modeling Methodology above) were automatically
identified as active, passive, or other, guided by heuristics.
Whereas all passives primed in Savage et al.’s (2003) experiment included an agentive by-clause (e.g., The ball got
caught by the net), the corpus contains only four examples
of children using a passive form with expressed agent, one
of which is recitation from a storybook. Agentive by-clauses
are optional in English, and their sparsity appears to be representative of natural language production (Huttenlocher et al.,
2004). Accordingly, the present study considered agentless
passives (e.g., I got caught) along with agentive passives.
The Savage et al. experiment considered “only the first
sentence-like utterance . . . produced after exposure to each
prime sentence,” so we also compared only adjacent utterances from the corpus. Only pairs where the target was spoken by a child from age 2;0 to 7;6 were included; the potential primes were spoken by adults and children of all ages,
but were always spoken in the presence of the target child.
Furthermore, pairs were omitted from the analysis if either of
the two sentences contained a negation or was a wh-question,
which were not used by Savage et al., or if a sentence was not
identified as obviously passive or active. A contingency table
of the remaining pairings already makes clear that an active
prime is much more likely than a passive one to precede an
active target; see Table 1.
To answer the main questions of whether children’s priming is dependent on their age and on lexical overlap, we fit

• AGE: the child’s age represented as decimal years with precision to the day;2
• L EX B OOST: the ratio of the number of words in common
between both utterances to the total number of words in the
target utterance;
• P RIME T YPE: CP for comprehension-production priming
(another speaker produces the prime and the child comprehends it and produces the target) or PP for productionproduction priming (the child produces both the prime and
the target).

Results
Table 2 above gives the coefficients of the mixed model together with significance values. We find a significant interaction of P RIME and L EX B OOST. All other interactions and
the main effect of P RIME T YPE were evaluated and found to
be non-significant regressors, so the model was refit without
them. In particular, the model shows no influence of a child’s
age on his production of active or passive sentences, with or
without active or passive primes (no main effect of AGE, no
interaction P RIME :AGE).
The dependent variable TARGET was mapped such that
passive targets yield TRUE and active targets yield FALSE. The
positive coefficient for the P RIME[PASSIVE]:L EX B OOST interaction therefore means that together, a passive prime and lex2 Where a child’s age was specified to only monthly precision, the
median value of 15 days after the start of that month was assumed.

where p (Su ) is the prior probability that an arbitrary structure
S will appear in any utterance u . Using this approach, general
structural priming—not only for specific structures—can be
quantified in a single model.
Besides the sparsity of passives, both Study 1 and the experiment on which it was based had another limitation. By
considering only adjacent utterances, they treated priming as
an immediate phenomenon and ignored its well-documented
temporal decay (Branigan, Pickering, & Cleland, 1999; Pickering & Ferreira, 2008). The formalism just
 presented is easily extended to estimate p Sprime | Starget , d , that is, the probability that structure S appeared in the d-th utterance before
TARGET was spoken (Reitter et al., 2006; Reitter, 2008).

Discussion
Our method of modeling the corpus is not identical to the
analyses Savage et al. (2003) performed on their experimental
data, but the results are comparable in qualitative terms. Savage et al. performed separate analyses of variance (ANOVA,
an instance of linear regression), one for each target voice.
For both voices, Savage et al. found reliable main effects
of P RIME. The reliable interaction between P RIME and
L EX B OOST we found in the corpus data was also present
in Savage et al.’s ANOVA for passive targets. Meanwhile,
P RIME and L EX B OOST formed part of a significant threeway interaction with AGE only in their ANOVA of active targets; they further broke down the active targets to find the
P RIME:L EX B OOST interaction in their three- and four-yearold participants but not in six-year-olds. As mentioned above
the CHILDES corpus is sparse in data over age five, which
likely explains why we did not find any interaction with age.
That the effect of age was only found in active targets suggests that the sparsity of passive targets in both datasets is
also important. This weakness cannot be overcome with the
studies structured as they are—neither in experimental data
nor in corpus data—simply because of the natural sparsity of
passives in children’s spoken language. Therefore, instead
of relying on only a single alternation for insight into children’s language, in the next study we investigated children’s
to priming of arbitrary syntactic structures.

Structural Overlap
To measure repetition of arbitrary syntactic structures, we
need a way to identify whether two constructions share the
same structure or are syntactically distinct. We used the hierarchical structure supplied in the form of CHILDES’s dependency annotation for this purpose, based on evidence that
priming relies on shared hierarchical syntactic rules (Bock &
Loebell, 1990; Reitter, 2008). However, priming is not sensitive to thematic roles (Bock & Loebell, 1990), so the relation
labels in the annotation are not useful. We therefore used the
part-of-speech tags from the CHILDES morphological annotation instead, imposed upon the dependency hierarchy. This
combination gives the same analysis to those structures typically considered correspondent in priming studies (Figures 1a
and 1b) while producing different analyses for their characteristic alternations (Figure 1c vs. 1a and 1b).
For this study, we used the subset of such structures that
have exactly three levels. Of this subset, those with very low
frequency—fewer than about twenty occurrences over the
entire corpus, according to a manual evaluation—were usually incorrect analyses derived from inaccurate annotations in
CHILDES (either in the morphosyntactic or the dependency
structure). Thus data points corresponding to structures with
frequency less than twenty were discarded. This leaves 4,279
unique structures for consideration, representing 81.3% of the
original data. No outliers on the high end of the frequency
spectrum were discarded, as they were correct analyses.

Study 2: Priming of Arbitrary Structures
with Decay
Most priming studies to date have only considered structures
for which a semantically equivalent alternation exists. This
limits the generality of conclusions that can be drawn, and
data sparseness is a potential problem, as illustrated above. In
the present study, we therefore use an approach that does not
require the existence of an alternation, asking instead whether
the appearance of a prime structure increases the probability
that the same structure will appear again.
We define priming in probabilistic terms: the appearance
of a prime structure increases the conditional probability that

Probability of Repetition

Each structure S in some child’s (age 2;0 to 7;6) utterance
t was considered a potential target of adaptation, primed by
the structures in all utterances p within the window of the
fifteen utterances preceding t. For each combination of t,
S ∈ t, and d (1 ≤ d ≤ 15), a record was created of whether
S was in p = t − d. That is, the model’s binary dependent
variable represents repetition of a certain structure across a
certain distance. Consequently, the parameters estimated by
the regression model are effects on mere structural repetition.
Priming is identified in this formulation by its decay, so only
interactions with the variable D IST (which represents d) can
be interpreted in terms of priming; specifically, negative coefficients of D IST indicate priming.
Because measuring grammatical abstraction requires differentiating between lexical and structural repetition, data
points showing structural repetition resulting from complete
lexical repetition (i.e., not differing by at least one word)—
one-half a percent of the dataset—were dropped for this
study. Structures in the first fifteen utterances of any interview session also were not considered as targets because they
may have been influenced by primes not captured in the corpus. The remaining data points were segregated into strata,
one stratum for each three-month period of each child. Twothousand five-hundred data points were randomly sampled
from each stratum, unless the stratum contained fewer than
2,500 points, in which case the entire stratum was used.
A mixed-effects logistic regression model was built to correlate structural repetition across distance (D IST) with explanatory variables AGE and P RIME T YPE as described in
Study 1 and with the following variables:

Figure 2: Decay of priming in children. The dashed line is the

the probability of a structure above its prior, the true mean
will be closer to the repetition probability at D IST = 15.
that less frequent structures show stronger adaptation. Note
that the interaction’s positive coefficient needs to be interpreted in the context of the negative slope of ln(D IST) (repetition decreases with increasing distance) and the positive slope
of ln(F REQ) (less repetition for more frequent structures).
We also observe a significant positive coefficient of
ln(D IST):L EX B OOST, suggesting that priming (that is, the
decay of D IST) may weaken under lexical boost, all other factors held fixed. Meanwhile, ln(D IST):ln(F REQ):L EX B OOST
has a negative coefficient: the decay effect increases with lexical boost and increasing frequency. This means we find the
lexical boost effect to be stronger for high-frequency items.
The ln(D IST):AGE interaction is marginally significant
(p = 0.075), providing only weak evidence for the claim
that structural priming increases with age. More convincing support of this prediction is offered by the significant
ln(D IST):ln(F REQ):AGE interaction. Its positive coefficient
means that priming (the decay of D IST) becomes stronger if
age increases while frequency decreases, or weaker as age
and frequency increase. In other words, the inverse-frequency
effect is stronger for older children than for younger children.
ln(D IST):AGE:L EX B OOST is not significant. We therefore
find no evidence for our suggestion that lexical boost may
influence structural priming differently as children gradually
abstract grammar from phrasal repetition.
The marginally significant ln(D IST):P RIME T YPE interaction hints that children may be more inclined to repeat their
own previous constructions (P RIME T YPE = PP) than primes
by another speaker.

• L EX B OOST: a binary variable that is TRUE if the heads of
both hierarchical structures use the same root morpheme
(lemma);
• ln(F REQ): the logarithmically transformed frequency of
the structure in the entire corpus.
This experimental setup crucially relies on the assumption
that priming decays. Figure 2 plots the sampled probability
that an arbitrary structure is repeated between two utterances
separated by a variable distance. It clearly shows the probability of repetition diminishes as a function of distance, with
higher repetition across shorter distances—in short, structural
priming decays.
There is evidence that both human attention and priming
decay logarithmically (McKone, 1995). This is supported by
Figure 2, and indeed the mixed-effects model yields a better
fit when variable D IST is transformed logarithmically than
when it is linear.

Discussion

Table 3 shows parameter estimates of the full model specification. We find a significant, negative coefficient for ln(D IST),
showing the decay of priming of arbitrary structures in children’s speech. In line with previous research (Reitter, 2008),
the significant interaction ln(D IST):ln(F REQ) demonstrates

This model shows that priming of arbitrary structures is evident in children, a population in which priming of only a few
syntactic alternations had been studied previously. This study
also provides an estimate that priming’s main efficacy lasts

and found similar effects in corpus data to those reported experimentally (Savage et al., 2003). Both studies tested the hypothesis that structural adaptation increases with age. Study 2
found evidence for this claim, though the change is not as
large as might be expected by an item-based account of language acquisition. Neither study supports our conjecture, influenced by the item-based hypothesis, that the lexical boost
effect should decrease with age, as children move from lexicalized to abstract syntactic knowledge.

around six utterances, during which it shows strong decay
and after which its decay is negligible (see Figure 2). Most
importantly, this study enables us to quantify priming effects
according to age during first language acquisition.
Crucially, the results do not support the conjecture offered
in the Introduction that structural priming’s reliance on lexical boost decreases as children age. It is important to bear
in mind that this conjecture is not strictly predicted by the
item-based hypothesis, which does not specify precisely what
types of analogies children must make to abstract a grammar
from word patterns. Kemp et al. (2005) provide evidence similar to our results, observing in one experiment that two-yearolds adapted to structural priming without regard to lexical
influence.
On the other hand, we did find evidence that overall structural priming increases with age. If this is true, it supports the
item-based hypothesis of language acquisition which holds
that over time children gradually abstract grammatical rules
from the sentences they hear.

Conclusion
This paper reported two corpus-based studies of structural
priming during first language acquisition. Study 1 replicated an experiment on passive/active priming in children,
