Effects of the Target Distribution on Numerical Prediction
Jason Jones
University of California, San Diego
Abstract: Human subjects repeatedly attempted to predict a four-digit number. The distribution producing the
target numbers was varied within subjects. Target distribution had a large effect on prediction performance. The
target distribution standard deviation was a good predictor of the slope of the learning curve across trials.
