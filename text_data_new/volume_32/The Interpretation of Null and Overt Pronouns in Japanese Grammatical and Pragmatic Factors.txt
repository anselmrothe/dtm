Abstract
Pronoun interpretation in English has been demonstrated to be
sensitive to an interaction between grammatical and
pragmatically-driven factors. This study investigated the
interpretation of pronouns in Japanese, which has both null and
overt forms. Thirty-two native speakers of Japanese participated
in a passage completion experiment with transfer-of-possession
contexts, varying prompt type, aspect, and topic/nominativemarking of the previous subject. Two judges annotated the
referents of the matrix subjects and coherence relations in the
completed passages. Japanese overt pronouns were revealed to
pattern closely with English overt pronouns in their sensitivity to
pragmatic factors, whereas Japanese null pronouns were
predominantly governed by grammatical position. Somewhat
surprisingly, topic-marking did not influence reference or
coherence relations. The data suggest distinctive patterns of
interactions between grammatical and pragmatic factors in the
interpretation of null and overt pronouns in Japanese, and cast
doubt on the existence of a division of labor between the two
forms.

found that the influence of aspect in pronoun interpretation
was correlated with certain relationships inferred to hold
between the two clauses (henceforth ‘coherence relations’),
suggesting that a shift in the distribution of coherence
relations induced the shift in the distribution of pronoun
interpretations.
Following Stevenson et al. (1994), Rohde et al. (2008) ran
passages with pronoun prompts like (1) against those with
‘free’ prompts (3).
(3) John handed/was handing a book to Bob.

Results showed more references to the Source and more
Source-biased coherence relations in the pronoun condition
than in the free condition, indicating that pronouns overlay a
grammatical subject bias on top of the pragmatic biases that
were revealed by the aspect manipulation.

Introduction
Previous work (Stevenson, Crawley, & Kleinman, 1994;
Arnold, 2001; Rohde, Kehler, & Elman, 2006, 2008) has
shown that pronoun interpretation in English is driven by
the interaction of grammatical and pragmatic biases. For
instance, Rohde et al. (2006) showed that pronoun
interpretation differs in transfer-of-possession passages that
vary by verbal aspect between perfective (1) and
imperfective (2).
(1) JohnSOURCE handed a book to BobGOAL
He ____________________________
(2) JohnSOURCE was handing a book to BobGOAL
He ________________________________
The context sentences in (1) and (2) contain two possible
referents for the pronoun, one that appears in subject
position and fills the Source thematic role (John), and one
that appears as the object of a prepositional phrase and fills
the Goal thematic role (Bob). The results of a passage
completion experiment revealed significantly more
interpretations of pronouns to the Source referent (the
grammatical subject) in the imperfective condition as
compared to the perfective condition. Rohde et al. also

Null pronouns in Japanese occur most commonly in subject
position, but occasionally in object positions as well (Ueno
& Polinsky, 2009). Overt pronouns also exist, but occur less
commonly than the null forms (Martin, 1976).1
The interpretation of Japanese null pronouns has been
claimed to be analogous to the interpretation of overt
pronouns in other languages without a null form (e.g.,
Kuroda, 1965; Kameyama, 1985; inter alia). The
GIVENNESS HIERARCHY (GH) of Gundel, Hedberg, and
Zacharski (1993) makes this claim as well, and further
predicts that the Japanese null and overt forms should
display a ‘division of labor’ effect whereby the preferred
referents of the two forms fall into complementary
distribution. These predictions result from the fact that the
six cognitive statuses that comprise the GH participate in an
implicational hierarchy, and are thus expected to give rise to
scalar implicatures. According to the GH, English overt
pronouns and Japanese null pronouns require referents of
the highest status (IN FOCUS), whereas Japanese overt
pronouns occupy the second highest status (ACTIVATED).
1

The Japanese third person overt pronouns (e.g., kare ‘he’,
kanojo ‘she’) are generally considered to be direct translations of
their English counterparts, and appear to be becoming incorporated
into daily Japanese at an increasing rate. A corpus count of Asahi
Shimbun (popular Japanese newspaper) articles shows that out of
11,073,167 sentences, kare was used 28,795 times and kanojo
14,209 times (Amano & Kondo, 2000).

2057

Whereas overt pronouns are compatible with both
ACTIVATED and IN FOCUS referents, Grice’s (1975) Maxim
of Quantity (‘say as much as you need to say’) predicts that
the informationally-stronger null form should be used for IN
FOCUS referents, in turn predicting that overt pronouns will
be used only for referents that are ACTIVATED but not IN
FOCUS, creating the division-of-labor effect.
A relatively small number of experimental studies have
been performed on the interpretation of null pronouns.
Working within Centering Theory, Walker, Iida, and Cote
(1994) reported an influence of grammatical/informationstructural factors found in a referent-choice experiment,
including higher salience for topic-marked (-wa; cf. Kuno,
1973) than nominative/subject-marked (-ga) referents. A
recent study by Christianson and Cho (2009) suggests that
topical arguments in Odawa are more likely to be realized as
null pronouns than non-topical arguments. Experiments
performed by Alonso-Ovalle et al. (2002) offered mixed
support for a division-of-labor effect between null and overt
pronouns in Spanish. In a written questionnaire study, for
instance, null pronouns referred to the previous subject
73.2% of the time whereas overt pronouns did 50.2% of the
time; while null pronouns clearly incorporated a stronger
subject bias, the referents of the two forms were not strictly
in complimentary distribution. Further, whereas an
acceptability judgment task found that participants rated
sentences with unambiguous references to the previous
subject as being more acceptable when a null pronoun was
used (4.19 on a 5-point scale) as compared to when an overt
pronoun was used (3.57), the overt pronoun cases were still
deemed to be relatively acceptable.
Taken together, the foregoing work gives rise to a series
of questions that the present study seeks to answer. First, we
ask whether the behavior of Japanese null and/or overt
pronouns patterns with that of English overt pronouns in
displaying sensitivity to pragmatic subsequent-mention
biases, or whether their interpretation is determined
primarily by other (e.g., grammatical) factors. This question
can be addressed by employing a passage completion task
that uses the same aspect manipulation employed by Rohde
et al. (2006). The second question is whether null and overt
Japanese pronouns exhibit a division-of-labor effect such
that, for instance, a demonstrated subject bias for null
pronouns corresponds to a commensurate non-subject bias
for overt pronouns. This question will be answered using a
manipulation that varies prompt type between null pronoun,
overt pronoun, and free. Third, we ask whether topicmarked antecedents attract more pronominal references than
subject-marked antecedents. We will answer this question
by varying the morphological marking on the first
mentioned referent of the preceding clause, specifically
between subject/nominative marking (-ga) and topic
marking (-wa). Lastly, we ask whether any grammatical
biases that are revealed to be associated with these
referential forms affects the distribution of ensuing
coherence relations, as Rohde et al. (2008) found for
English. This question will be answered by having judges

annotate the completions with respect to coherence relations
and comparing the resulting distributions across prompt
types.

Methods
We followed the passage completion task design used by
Rohde et al. (2006, 2008) using Japanese stimuli.

Participants
Thirty-two native speakers of Japanese recruited from the
San Diego area participated in the study. Participants were
reimbursed for their time.

Materials
The experiment employed a 3x2x2 design that varied
prompt type (Null-pronoun2/Overt-pronoun3/Free), aspect
(Perfective/Imperfective4), and topic/nominative-marking of
the context sentence subject (-wa/-ga), as shown in (4).

The 60 experimental stimuli each had context sentences
with different transfer-of-possession verbs. The Source
referent (‘Taro’ in (4)) always appeared in subject position,
and the Goal referent (‘Jiro’) was the dative/‘to’-marked
indirect object of the sentence. All verbs described physical
transfer events (e.g., ‘hand’, ‘throw’).
Fillers consisted of 40 context sentences, containing
transitive or intransitive non-transfer verbs in the perfective
2
The ‘subject-omission’ prompt was used to indicate the
presence of a null pronoun. A pilot study revealed that most
participants were capable of continuing such prompts
appropriately, which was confirmed in the actual study.
3
All overt pronoun prompts were topic-marked. This was done
because the pilot study revealed that nominative-marked overt
pronouns tend to be used to express an embedded subject of a
complex sentence rather than a matrix subject. Topic-marking the
pronoun resolved the issue.
4
Imperfectivity is not as straightforward to encode in Japanese
as in English, since -teita ‘was ~ing’ is ambiguous between a
perfective and imperfective reading depending on the verb (or VP)
with which it co-occurs. Because transfer-of-possession verbs
typically express achievement events as a default, the more natural
interpretation of -teita with these verbs is perfective. We therefore
use tokoro (‘was in the scene of’) to ‘stretch out’ instantaneous
events and make an imperfective reading of achievement events
possible, in a manner similar to what the English progressive does
to achievement events.

or imperfective aspect. The transitive verbs varied between
active and passive voice, and adverbs, names, and genderunambiguous overt pronouns served as prompts. The 100
sets of sentences instantiating the 12 (3x2x2) experimental
conditions were placed in a Latin square design to create 12
parallel lists of 100 sentences, such that no one participant
saw more than one sentence from each set.

Explanation: continuations that describe the cause of the
eventuality described in the context sentence
e.g., Taro handed a book to Jiro. He no longer had a
use for it.
Occasion: continuations that describe an eventuality that
initiates from the end state of affairs of the eventuality
described in the context sentence
e.g., Taro handed a book to Jiro. He began reading it.

Task

Result: continuations that describe the effect or result of
the eventuality described in the context sentence
e.g., Taro handed a book to Jiro. He thanked him for
the gift.

Using a web-based interface, participants were asked to
write continuations for the 100 passages. They were
instructed to imagine a natural continuation to the story,
writing the first continuation that came to mind and
avoiding humor.

The judges resolved disagreements through discussion.

Data Analysis
Following previous studies on English, we focused our
analysis on the interpretation of matrix subjects. Identifying
the matrix subject can be less straightforward in Japanese
than in English, however, since Japanese clauses may
contain multiple null elements, and are characterized by
flexible and head-final word order. It therefore proved
useful to translate the continuations into English, thereby
recovering the referents of null elements. For instance, if the
original sentence in Japanese said ‘felt happy because
passed exam’, detectable null pronouns were postulated, as
in ‘(s/he) felt happy because (s/he) passed (her/his) exam’ in
the relevant English translation. The first author (who is a
native speaker of Japanese) then underlined the likely
matrix subject of the given sentence for the subsequent
annotation processes.
Two trained judges, who were native speakers of
Japanese but were blind to the experimental hypotheses,
annotated the referent of the matrix subject of each
continuation sentence with respect to five categories: Source
(‘Taro’ in (4)), Goal (‘Jiro’), Theme (‘book’), Other, and
Unsure. The judges were instructed to do the annotation
separately, without talking to each other. The first author
compared their annotations and discarded the cases the
judges did not agree on, as well as the cases in which
participants did not omit a subject even though they were
given a null pronoun prompt. The tokens discarded in this
way constituted about 15% of the data.
The remaining tokens were then given back to the judges
for annotating the coherence relations that held between
each context sentence and continuation, as shown below
(Hobbs, 1990; Kehler, 2002; Rohde, 2008).5
Elaboration: continuations that provide additional details
about the eventuality described in the context sentence
e.g., Taro handed a book to Jiro. He did so slowly and
carefully.

Although there are several other coherence relations which
sometimes occurred – e.g., ‘Violated Expectation’ and ‘Parallel’ –
we analyzed only these four.

Results
Reference
ANOVAs were run on the percentage of Source referents as
a function of the total number of Source and Goal referents.
Prompt type, aspect, and topic/nominative marking were
used as factors. There was a significant main effect of
prompt type [F1(2, 31) = 74.11, p<.0001; F2(2, 59) = 64.10,
p<.0001]. Subsequent Tukey HSD posthoc comparisons
found significant differences in order of Null > Overt > Free
by both participants and items, i.e., Null pronouns were
most Source-biased, followed by Overt pronouns, followed
by Free prompt continuations. There was also a significant
main effect of aspect [F1(1, 31) = 15.81, p<.0001; F2(1, 59)
= 21.02, p<.0001], indicating that Imperfectives yielded
more Source referents than Perfectives. Figure 1 shows the
proportion of Source and Goal referents for each prompt
type and aspect (collapsed over topic/nominative-marking)
averaged across participants. The null pronoun conditions
had about 80% Source referents irrespective of aspect, while
Overt and Free conditions varied by aspect. Pairwise
comparisons between Imperfectives and Perfectives within
each prompt type revealed significant differences for Overt
pronoun [t1(31) = 3.70, p=.0008; t2(59) = 3.95, p=.0002] and
Free [t1(31) = 1.59, ns; t2(52)6 = 3.47, p=.0011]7 conditions,
but not for Null conditions.

Some degrees of freedom vary due to missing cells.
The lack of significance by subjects in the Free prompt
condition was due in part to the fact that the analysis included all
continuations, as opposed to only those in which participants
started their continuation with something other than a pronoun
(i.e., a proper name). When name continuations only were
compared, the aspect distinction yielded a marginal effect by
participants [t1(23) = 2.02, p=.0551] and remained significant by
items [t2(43) = 2.56, p=.0141].

Mirroring Rohde et al. (2008), overt pronouns led to
significantly more subject mentions of the Source than free
prompts. We further divided the free prompt continuations
according to their matrix subject type, namely, Null
pronouns, Overt pronouns, and Names, and performed the
same ANOVA as above. The results yielded significant
main effects of aspect [F1(1, 31) = 4.01, p=.0462; F2(1, 59)
= 6.02, p=.0149] and subject type [F1(2, 31) = 67.59,
p<.0001; F2(2, 59) = 43.40, p<.0001]. Subsequent Tukey
HSD posthoc comparisons found significant differences in
order of Null > Overt > Free by participants and Null >
Overt, Free by items, which shows the highest proportion of
Goal referents for Name continuations, again consistent
with Rohde et al.
Unlike aspect, however, there were no significant main
effects or interactions involving topic-marking. Figure 2
shows the proportion of Source and Goal referents for each
prompt type and topic/nominative-marking (collapsed over
aspect) averaged across participants. Pairwise comparisons
between Topics and Nominatives within each prompt type
revealed no significant differences for any prompt type, but
there was a marginal difference in Null continuations [t1(30)
= 1.70, p=.0989; t2(57) = 1.87, p=.0665] that favored subject
referents in the topic condition.

For our statistical analysis, we collapsed the proportion of

the one hand and Occasion and Result (Goal-biased
relations) on the other hand for each participant's
continuations, and conducted repeated measures ANOVAs
on the proportion of Source-biased relations over Sourceand Goal-biased relations. There was a significant main
effect of prompt type [F1(2, 31) = 25.94, p<.0001; F2(2, 59)
= 22.34, p<.0001; Tukey HSD: Null > Overt > Free by
participants, and Null > Overt, Free by items], suggesting
that Null prompt conditions were most Source-biased. There
was also a significant main effect of aspect [F1(1, 31) =
9.75, p=.0018; F2(1, 59) = 9.54, p=.0021], suggesting that
Imperfectives yielded more Source-biased relations than
Perfectives (Figure 5). Pairwise comparisons between
Imperfectives and Perfectives within each prompt type

Discussion
As was the case for reference, ANOVAs revealed no main
effects or interactions involving topic marking. While
Figure 6 indicates a small numerical trend of more Sourcebiased relations for topic-marked than nominative-marked
Overt and Free continuations, pairwise comparisons
between Topics and Nominatives within each prompt type
revealed no significant or marginal differences.
In summary, the distribution of coherence relations
generally followed the pattern found for reference, being
consistent with previous studies in English (Rohde et al.,
2006, 2008).
8
As was the case for reference, the mixed results for the Free
prompt condition were due in part to the fact that the analysis
included all continuations, as opposed to only those in which
participants started their continuation with something other than a
pronoun (i.e., a proper name). When only Name continuations
were compared, there was a marginal difference between
Imperfectives and Perfectives by participants [t1(20) = 1.98,
p=.0619] and a significant one by items [t2(32) = 2.05, p=.0483].
9
Posthoc observation revealed that the proportion of
Elaborations within the Source-biased relations was consistently
higher for Imperfectives than Perfectives for all prompt types.
ANOVAs run on the proportion of Elaboration over Elaboration
and Explanation relations revealed a significant main effect of
aspect [F1(1, 31) = 28.29, p<.0001; F2(1, 59) = 30.63, p<.0001]
with no other statistically-supported main effects or interactions.
Imperfective conditions had a uniformly higher proportion of
Elaboration than Explanation relations across prompt types;
pairwise comparisons between Imperfectives and Perfectives
within each prompt type revealed significant differences for all
types except for Free prompts by subjects [Null: t1(23) = 2.42,
p=.0240; t2(39) = 2.54, p=.0151; Overt: t1(24) = 3.36, p=.0026;
t2(39) = 3.06, p=.0040; Free: t1(17) = 1.70, p = .1069; t2(28) =
2.36, p=.0256]. Participants were therefore more likely to elaborate
an event described as ongoing (imperfective) than one described as
completed (perfective), indicating an effect of aspect on coherence
that is independent of the choice of subsequently mentioned entity.

We are now in a position to answer the four questions posed
in the introduction to the paper. First, we asked whether the
behavior of Japanese null and/or overt pronouns patterns
with that of English overt pronouns in displaying sensitivity
to pragmatic subsequent-mention biases, or whether their
interpretation is determined primarily by other (e.g.,
grammatical) factors. The results indicate that Japanese null
pronoun interpretation is not analogous to English overt
pronoun interpretation as previous researchers have
suggested. Instead, null pronouns were most strongly and
uniformly Source-biased for both interpretation and
coherence relations, apparently being driven predominantly
by grammatical position and without showing sensitivity to
the aspect manipulation. Instead, overt Japanese pronouns
patterned with English in demonstrating such sensitivity,
with Imperfective conditions yielding more Source referents
and Source-biased coherence relations. Further, overt
pronouns led to significantly more mentions of the Source
than free prompts, demonstrating that, like English overt
pronouns, Japanese overt pronouns overlay a subject bias on
top of pragmatically-driven ones. Indeed, the results for
Japanese overt pronouns mirrored those of Rohde et al.
(2006, 2008) for English pronouns quite closely.
The second question we asked is whether null and overt
Japanese pronouns exhibit a division-of-labor effect such
that a demonstrated subject bias for null pronouns would
correspond to a commensurate non-subject bias for overt
pronouns. The answer is no; both null and overt pronouns
displayed a subject bias, and hence their referents were not
in complimentary distribution. Although the nature of the
biases were different – overt pronouns overlay a subject bias
on top of pragmatically-driven subsequent-mention biases
as measured in the free prompt condition, whereas null
pronouns appear to have a more grammaticalized subject
bias that is impervious to pragmatic expectations – both
pronominal forms were used to refer to Sources more often

2061

than Goals. It therefore appears that the use of an overt
pronoun does not implicate that the referent is an entity
other than what the preferred referent would have been if a
null pronoun had been used (i.e., the subject). At first blush,
these patterns nonetheless appear consistent with those
found for Spanish by Alonso-Ovalle et al. (2002), although
further comparison is difficult since the experimental tasks
and manipulations carried out were very different.
The third question we asked was whether topic-marked
antecedents attract more pronominal references than
subject-marked antecedents. The answer again was no.
Perhaps surprisingly, there was no significant influence of
topic marking across prompt types.
Lastly, we asked whether any grammatical biases that are
revealed to be associated with these referential forms affects
the distribution of ensuing coherence relations, as Rohde et
al. (2008) found for English. This is clearly the case.
Although the null and overt pronouns were always fully
ambiguous between the available Source and Goal referents,
their appearance in a prompt biased the continuation toward
mentioning the previous subject referent first, which in turn
biased the participants toward continuing the story using a
Source-biased coherence relation. Further, while the aspect
manipulation in the null pronoun condition created
differences in the distribution of Source-biased relations –
imperfectives resulted in a greater number of Elaborations,
at the expense of Explanations (see footnote 9) – it did not
change the allocation between Source- and Goal-biased
relations, in accord with the fact that the aspect
manipulation resulted in no difference in the distribution
between Source and Goal referents.
Several experiments suggest themselves as ways of
confirming the conclusions arrived at in this paper. One is to
see whether the lack of effect of pragmatic bias for null
pronouns holds across different verb types. Whereas we
manipulated aspect on a single type (transfer of possession),
we could also vary the verbs themselves, choosing types
that are known to yield substantially different subsequentmention biases. Contexts employing object-biased implicit
causality verbs, for instance, would offer strong test for the
subject bias associated with null pronouns. Likewise, the
lack of effect of topic-marking could be further examined by
comparing reference in contexts in which nominativemarked subject referents compete with topic-marked object
referents. Such studies remain for future work.
