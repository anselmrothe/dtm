Abstract: Knowing multiple procedures and using them adaptively is important for problem-solving. We examined
how different methods for developing procedural flexibility affected novices learning equation solving. Students
(N = 198) were assigned to one of three conditions that differed in whether multiple procedures were introduced
immediately or after practice with one procedure (no delay vs. delay) and in whether comparison of examples was
supported. Students in the no delay condition had greater procedural flexibility and accuracy than students in either
delay condition, regardless of whether they compared examples. Differences in studentsâ€™ explanations during the
intervention suggest reasons for the benefits of immediate introduction to multiple procedures. Students in the no
delay condition more frequently compared and evaluated efficiency of procedures than students in delay conditions.
They also more frequently used efficient procedures during the intervention. Immediate introduction to multiple
procedures supports attention to and adaption of efficient procedures, which benefits flexibility.
