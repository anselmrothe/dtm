Abstract
In two experiments, we investigated the development of
cross-sectioning ability using either three-dimensional (3D) or
two-dimensional (2D) stimuli. Three to 9 year old children
visualized cross-sections of either real 3D geometric shapes
(Experiment 1) or 2D photographs of the shapes (Experiment
2). Performance on the 3D task was also analyzed to
determine to what extent cross-sectioning ability is related to
performance on more widely used spatial tasks including
mental rotation and the water-level task. We found that
performance on the cross-sectioning and mental rotation tasks
were significantly correlated, and the 2D and 3D tasks were
both successful in assessing cross-sectioning ability in young
children. As expected, we also found a significant increase in
cross-sectioning performance across age groups.
Key Words: spatial development; cross-section; education.

Introduction
Spatial ability is important for success across a variety of
academic subjects, particularly in the science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Spatial
ability is also related to choosing technological and sciencerelated careers and predicts the choice of math and science
as college majors (Shea, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2001), as
suggested by the fact that individual differences across
verbal, quantitative, and spatial abilities at age 13 were
predictive of educational and vocational group membership
20 years later. However, despite the importance of spatial
ability, spatial training is not a regular part of school
curricula and there are no national or state standards for
spatial intelligence. Consequently, many students have
difficulty with spatial tasks and lack the opportunity to
improve their spatial reasoning skills.
Spatial ability can refer to a wide range of skills, some of
which focus on how individuals perceive and act on objects
in space while others focus on how individuals orient and
navigate within space. One category of spatial ability of
particular interest is spatial visualization, or the ability to
understand, mentally encode, and manipulate 3D forms
(Carroll, 1993; Hegarty & Waller, 2004).
Cross-sectioning, also referred to as “penetrative”
thinking (Kali & Orion, 1996) is a particular spatial
visualization skill that involves inferring a 2D representation
of a 3D structure, and vice versa (Cohen & Hegarty, 2007).

This imaginary slicing of a 3D object to a 2D plane is an
essential skill for many of the sciences, ranging from
anatomical cross-sections in biology and neuroscience to
cross-sections of landforms in geology (Cohen & Hegarty,
2008). Conversely, in order to understand what is under a
microscope, students must also be able to mentally
reconstruct a 3D object from a given 2D image.
Spatial visualization requires performing multistep
manipulations of spatial representations, such as a paperfolding task that requires the ability to work quickly, rotate
figures, and keep track of multiple operations. This is
thought to be distinct from other spatial tasks such as spatial
perception and mental rotation (Linn & Petersen, 1985). For
example, the water-level task, which requires subjects to
draw a horizontal line in a tilted bottle where they believe
the water level would be, is categorized as a spatial
perception task because it requires determining spatial
relationships with respect to a given frame of reference.
Linn and Petersen define mental rotation as a Gestalt-like
analogue process that involves accurately mentally rotating
a 2D or 3D figure. However, the development of crosssectioning ability has not been compared to these other
measures of spatial ability, in part because of a lack of
adequate measures and the unknown age at which this
ability emerges. Thus, we do not know whether it is more
related to spatial visualization, spatial perception, or mental
rotation.

Cross-Sectioning Ability of Young Children
There is disagreement about the age at which children are
able to reason about cross-sections of 3D objects. In contrast
to Piaget and Inhelder’s (1956) view that children should
have achieved mastery of geometric sectioning by 12 years
old, many studies have found that spatial visualization
involving cross-sections does not develop until the teenage
years. For example, most students do not accurately predict
the appearance of a geometric plane intersecting a simple
cone or sphere until sometime between the ages of 11 and
15 (Russell-Gebbett 1984, 1985), while even students in
grades 8, 10, and 12 have difficulty accurately choosing a
cross-section of simple geometric line drawings (Boe, 1968;
Davis, 1973).
The difficulty older children and adolescents have with
these assessments may be in the presentation of the test

2816

items themselves rather than a lack of underlying cognitive
processes supporting cross-sectioning skills. Assessments
involving cross-sections are often based on 2D diagrams
and complex figures that represent 3D objects. Although
these have been shown to successfully measure spatial
visualizations of cross-sections among adults (e.g., Santa
Barbara Solids Test, Cohen & Hegarty, 2007) and
adolescents (e.g., Mental Cutting Test “Schnitte,” QuaiserPohl, 2003), these assessments are too advanced for use
with younger children.
One factor impacting success when measuring other
spatial skills in young children has been using more
familiar, salient, and concrete stimuli. For example, tasks
have used pictures of humans and animals to successfully
measure mental rotation ability in young children (QuaiserPohl, 2003; Wiedenbauer & Janesen-Osmann, 2008).
Similarly, by using basic 2D geometric shapes, Levine and
colleagues (1999) were able to successfully assess mental
transformation ability in preschool children.
In the present study, we created a new method for
assessing cross-sectioning skills in young children by using
brightly colored foam shapes as the stimuli. We contrasted
this 3D method with a 2D method using photographs of the
actual shapes. Thus, we aimed to successfully measure
children’s cross-sectioning skills to determine a) how crosssectioning skills develop between the ages of 3 and 9 years,
b) the association between cross-sectioning skills and other
spatial reasoning tasks, and c) how the method of
assessment impacts performance.
We expected that using salient and familiar objects, such
as the foam shapes, would make the task accessible for
preschool to early elementary children. We also predicted
that there would be an increase in spatial ability across the
age range. We explored the relation between cross
sectioning and two other measures of spatial ability that
would engage similar yet categorically distinct spatial
operations (see Linn & Petersen, 1985): mental rotation and
the water-level task. We predicted that cross-sectioning
would correlate with these more established measures of
spatial reasoning but that the strength of the correlations
would vary depending on the spatial processes required.
Specifically, given that cross-sectioning involves
manipulating mental images and possibly rotation, we
predicted that performance on the cross-sectioning tasks
would be significantly correlated with performance on a
mental rotation task. However, as the water-level task has
been shown to demonstrate distinctly different spatial
operations from spatial visualization tasks (see metaanalysis by Linn & Petersen, 1985), we expected this task
might not correlate as strongly with cross-sectioning as
mental rotation.
Additionally, spatial ability has been shown to develop
even through early adolescence (Vasta & Liben, 1996).
Therefore, we expected to find an effect of age such that
performance on cross-sectioning improves over time.
Interestingly, using 3D objects adds complexity, which
some researchers have shown negatively impacts

performance on mental rotation tasks (e.g. Rosser, 1980).
Since cross-sectioning ability involves the interface of 2D
and 3D representations we might expect that this task would
be more difficult for young children because of the
increased complexity of the stimuli. Consequently, in
Experiment 2 we contrasted the presentation of the stimuli
between actual three-dimensional geometric shapes (3D)
and photographs of the real shapes (2D). Our expectation
was that young children would be more successful when
they were presented with problems involving cross-sections
of actual 3D objects than when these same cross-sectioning
problems were presented as photographs on a computer
screen.

Experiment 1
In this study, we developed an assessment of crosssectioning ability to determine if this task was suitable for
young children. Experiment 1 used real objects (e.g.,
geometric foam shapes) and compared performance on the
3D cross-sectioning task to performance on two other
standard measures of spatial ability (mental rotation and the
water-level task) to determine the trajectory of crosssectioning development during the early elementary years in
relation to other spatial skills.

Method
Participants. Fifty-one elementary students (17 boys, 34
girls) ranging in age from 5 years 0 months to 9 years 0
months (M=7.35 years, SD=1.16), were recruited from the
Chicago area. Participants were compensated $10 for their
time and travel and were also given a t-shirt for
participating. We constructed four age groups from the data
collected: 5 year olds (n=8, M=5.58 years, SD=0.32), 6 year
olds (n=11, M=6.43 years, SD=0.31), 7 year olds (n=16,
M=7.32 years, SD=0.32), and 8 to 9 year olds (n=8, M=8.69
years, SD=0.27).
Apparatus and materials. Stimuli for the cross-sectioning
task consisted of six solid foam geometric shapes. Each
solid had a base edge length or diameter of 7cm and a height
of either 7cm (sphere, pyramid) or 14cm (cone, cylinder,
rectangular prism,
triangular prism).

To create the 12 test items, each shape was bisected with
an intersecting plane of sturdy, gray stock paper (see Figure
1).
Design and Procedures.
Participants were tested on three spatial reasoning tasks in
a set order: cross-sectioning, mental rotation, and the waterlevel task. All participants were tested individually in a
laboratory at the University of Chicago.
Participants first completed a cross-sectioning task
adapted from Piaget and Inhelder (1956) and Boe (1968). In
this task, children were presented with one sample item and
twelve test items composed of familiar, colorful 3D foam
shapes that were cross-sectioned by an intersecting plane. A
sphere was used as the sample item and five different shapes
(a cone, cylinder, pyramid, rectangular prism, and triangular
prism) were used to construct the test items. Each shape was
used twice, with one test item depicting a cut along the
horizontal axis and the other along the vertical axis. An
additional horizontal cut cone and vertical cut rectangular
prism of different colors were used to complete the 12 test
items.
The experimenter first showed each solid foam shape to
the child, rotating the object so they could view all sides of
the object, and then identified it (e.g. “This is a cylinder”) in
order to familiarize the child with the stimuli. Next, the
experimenter showed the sample item. A sphere was
bisected with a piece of sturdy stock paper between the two
halves demonstrating where and how the object had been
cut (see Figure 1). The participant was told to imagine what
the inside of the sphere would look like if we were to pull it
apart at the cut point. The experimenter stated that the cut
side would be flat and may make a shape that is different
than the shape of the whole object that we see. The
participants were then asked to point to the resulting crosssection shape from an array of four 2D shape choices. All
shapes were cut either symmetrically (i.e., along the center)
or asymmetrically along the longitudinal or horizontal axis.
The stimuli were shown to the participants from one of two
orientations: half of the participants viewed the objects so
that they were looking at the intersecting plane from an
approximate 90 degree angle (e.g., the plane of the paper
was parallel to the ground such that the edges were more
visible, see Figure 1) and the other half viewed the
intersecting plane face-on (e.g., the paper was perpendicular
to the ground such that the surface around was fully visible).
Participants also completed the Primary Mental Abilities
(PMA) spatial relations test (Thurstone & Thurstone, 1963),
where they were asked to pick from a four-choice array the
shape that would make a square if it were put together with
the target shape. Participants were instructed that this task
was like a puzzle where shapes could be rotated to fit but
could not be flipped over.
Then, participants performed the water-level task adapted
from Piaget and Inhelder (1956). In this task, participants
were presented with a line drawing of a half-full bottle of
water. They were then given four pictures of empty bottles
tilted upright, to the left or to the right, 30°, 45°, and 60°

from horizontal. Participants were asked to draw the
resulting water line if the bottle was half full and was tilted.
The cross-sectioning and mental rotation tasks were
scored such that each participant received an accuracy score
(e.g., mean proportion correct), whereas the water-level task
measured the angular disparity from 0 degrees (e.g., mean
error). First, we present our analysis on the cross-sectioning
task as a new method to assess spatial visualization skill in
young children. Then, we compare performance across the
three tests.

Results
Table 1 presents the mean performance for each spatial task
by age group. Note, for the cross-sectioning task, there was
no significant difference based on the viewing orientation of
the test items (90 degrees: n=26, M=.69, SD=.21; facing:
n=25, M=.76, SD=.18). Thus, we collapsed across this factor
in our analysis.
For the cross-sectioning task, a 2x4 ANOVA (gender by
age group) revealed a significant effect of age group,
F(3,43)=7.98, p<.001, but no effect of gender,
F(1,43)=0.07, p=.79, and no interaction, F(3,43)=1.79,
p=.16.
Specifically,
cross-sectioning
performance
significantly improved at each age compared to the last,
except for between ages 6 and 7 years (all p’s < .02, using
Bonferroni adjustment). This reflects a developmental trend,
such that participants improve with age, starting at 5 years
old, and attain very good performance on this task (88%
correct) around 8 years of age.
We conducted an item analysis to determine item
difficulty. The most difficult test items across the entire
sample were generally those where the cross-section
resulted in a different shape from the whole, which we call

overall object, whereas incongruent items were harder due
to the cross-section resulting in a different shape than the
overall object. Positive correlations between the mental
rotation and cross-sectioning tasks were present across the 5
to 8 year age range. However, when controlling for age,
mental rotation was not a significant predictor of crosssectioning performance, which suggests these tasks are not
measuring identical skills but rather related spatial skills,
particularly in children younger than 8 years old. Further,
there was no significant correlation between performance on
the cross-sectioning and water-level tasks. Thus, crosssectioning ability is somewhat independent of both spatial
perception and mental rotation. We are currently examining
cross-sectioning performance in relation to another spatial
visualization task using a paper folding task that is
appropriate for young children.

Experiment 2

incongruent cross-sections (Table 2). For example,
performance on the pyramid cut horizontally to reveal a
square cross-section was the most difficult item (31%
accuracy rate overall). Conversely, shapes with congruent
cuts were much easier for children to grasp (e.g., the
pyramid cut vertically to reveal a triangle, 59% answered
correctly). Overall, children scored significantly higher on
the congruent items than the non-congruent items,
t(50)=3.72, p=.001.
For the mental rotation and water-level tasks, we
conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the mean
proportion correct (or the mean deviation score in the case
of the water level test) by gender and age group. We found a
significant age group effect for the mental rotation task,
F(3,43)=8.26, p<.001, and the water-level task,
F(3,43)=3.10, p = .04.
The cross-sectioning and mental rotation tasks were
significantly correlated across the entire sample, r(49)=.47,
p=.001. However, when controlling for age (in months), a
multiple regression model revealed that mental rotation
score was not a significant predictor for cross-sectioning
performance, ß = .23, p = .09, R2 = .40, ΔR2 = .04. Further,
when collapsing across age groups, we found no significant
correlation between cross-sectioning and water-level task
performance, r(49)=.20, p=.23.
In summary, children successfully completed the crosssectioning task, suggesting that children as young as 5 years
old are capable of performing basic cross-sections given the
appropriate stimuli. Further we found an increase in
performance with age. Difficulty of test items generally
represented two categories: congruent items were easier in
that the cross-section resulted in a similar shape to the

In order to examine the effects of presentation on crosssectioning ability, we contrasted performance using 3D and
2D stimuli. Hence, half of the participants saw real threedimensional geometric shapes (3D), while the other half of
participants viewed 2D photographs of the shapes on a
computer screen. We also investigated whether preschool
children as young as 3 years old would succeed at the task.
If successful, the cross-sectioning assessment would be
useful in a variety of settings outside of a laboratory, as well
as with a greater age range.

Method
Participants. Sixty-nine elementary students (37 boys, 32
girls) ranging in age from 3 years 1 month to 9 years 3
months (M=5.82 years, SD=1.66) were recruited as
previously described and randomly assigned to two groups:
3D stimuli (19 boys, 16 girls; age, M=5.72 years, SD=1.67,
range 3yrs1mos to 8yrs11mos) and 2D stimuli (19 boys, 16
girls; age, M=5.47 years, SD=1.74, range 3yrs1mos to
9yrs3mos).
Apparatus, Design and Procedures. All participants
received the same familiarization and testing procedure for
the cross-sectioning task only as described in Experiment 1.
However, participants were randomly assigned to either the
3D or 2D stimuli group, which determined the type of
objects they saw during the cross-sectioning test (either real
3D foam shapes used in Experiment 1 or 2D photographs of
the shapes, see Figure 1). Additionally, as viewing
orientation did not impact performance in Experiment 1, all
stimuli were held by the experimenter (for 3D) or presented
on a computer screen (for 2D) such that the intersecting
plane was at an approximate 90 degree angle to the child.

Results
Table 3 presents the mean proportion correct across age
groups within the 2D and 3D conditions. A 2x2x6 ANOVA
(condition by gender by age group) revealed a significant
interaction between condition and age group, F(5,46)=5.16,

condition in the 5, 6 and 7 year age groups (see Table 3), but
not in 3-4 year olds or 8-9 year olds. There was also a main
effect of age, F(5,46)=8.42, p<.001, such that performance
significantly increased with age overall, from early (4 years)
to late (8 years), p<.01 Bonferroni (3 yrs=48% correct, 4
yrs=49%, 5 yrs=58%, 6 yrs=59%, 7 yrs=72%, and 89yrs=84%). This replicates the developmental trend found
in Experiment 1 that children improve basic understanding
of cross-sections over time, and extends the earliest age
tested successfully to 3 years old.
Additionally, we compared performance on individual
test items between the 3D and 2D versions of the task
(Table 4). Again, the most difficult test items were
incongruent cross-sections (e.g, the pyramid cut horizontally

congruent cuts were much easier for children to grasp (e.g.,
the pyramid cut vertically to reveal a triangle). A 2x2

higher performance for congruent compared to incongruent

Discussion
In the present experiments we found that young children do
reason about cross-sections and this ability can be assessed
successfully using a task that involves either threedimensional simple geometric shapes or two-dimensional
photographs of simple geometric shapes. This ability
develops over time, such that basic understanding of crosssections improves from 3 to 8 years of age. Further, crosssectioning ability is independent from other spatial skills,
but is related to mental rotation more so than the water-level
task.
According to Linn & Petersen (1985), spatial
visualization
tasks
require
maintaining
mental
representations and performing multistep manipulations on
them. Thus, cross-sectioning skills, which involve such
complex mental operations and rotations, would likely be
categorized as a spatial visualization skill. As such, we
found that cross-sectioning is distinct from mental rotation,
as assessed by the Thurstone mental rotation test, and spatial
perception, as assessed by the water-level task. Although
some studies have not successfully measured crosssectioning ability in children younger than adolescence, we
found that a basic understanding of cross-sections emerges
as young as preschool.
Further, it is possible to assess cross-sectioning ability in
children using either real objects or photographs of real
objects. Although using 3D objects provided a significant
advantage for children between 5 and 7 years of age,
performance across the 2D group was still above chance
levels. The absence of a 3D advantage in the youngest
children (3 and 4 year olds) may be due to the use of a
simple shape matching strategy for both 3D objects and 2D

2820

photographs. For example, the triangular shaped cone
matches the isosceles triangle. However, we included at
least one foil item that had a similar shape as the correct
answer to prevent this strategy always leading to the answer.
In contrast, the absence of a 3D advantage in 8-9 year olds
may reflect the development of the ability to think about 2D
images as 3D objects. When asking about cross-sections of
any stimuli presented in 2D, one must successfully infer the
object as 3D prior to performing mental operations.
However, if children are unable to accurately process 2D
information into 3D structures, they are already starting at a
disadvantage. Further study is needed to examine possible
strategy differences in children with lower cross-sectioning
ability compared to those with more advanced skills. Also,
we aim to assess various methods for improving crosssectioning ability across the preschool to early elementary
ages.
