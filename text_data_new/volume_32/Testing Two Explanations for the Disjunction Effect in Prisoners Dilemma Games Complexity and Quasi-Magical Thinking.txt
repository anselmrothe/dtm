The paper explores the disjunction effect in the Prisoner’s
dilemma game using behavioral experiments with eyemovement recordings. An experiment was designed to
explore the complexity hypothesis about the appearance of
the disjunction effect. The results show that in games with
payoffs which are simpler to perceive and compare, the
disjunction effect disappears, while it is present when more
complex payoffs are used. In a second experiment, the
participants were told that the moves of the computer
opponent had been made before the game session. This
manipulation led again to the disappearance of the disjunction
effect even. We interpret this result as a suppressing of a
possible quasi-magic reasoning by stressing the fact that
participants’ own moves cannot influence the move of the
opponent. The results from the experiments point to
information processing complexity as a major factor for the
disjunction effect contrary to the conclusions in some
previous research.

1992; Croson, 1999; Busemeyer et al. 2006; Li, Taplin &
Zhang, 2007; Hristova & Grinberg, 2008). The disjunction
effect can be summarized as follows: experiments with oneshot PD games show that players choose move D more
often when they know the move of their opponent whatever
it is (C or D) than when they don’t know it. The logical
expectation is that if participants choose a particular strategy
for any of the two possible moves of the opponent, they
should have the same strategy when they don’t know their
opponent’s move. However, people do not act as expected
and cooperate more in the latter situation, i.e. when the
opponent move is uncertain.

Abstract

eye-tracking, Prisoner’s

Introduction
The Prisoner’s dilemma (PD) game is one of the most
extensively studied social dilemmas. PD is a two-person
game. The payoff table for this game is presented in Figure
1. In the PD game the players simultaneously choose their
moves – C (cooperate) or D (defect), without knowing their
opponent’s choice.
In order to be a Prisoner’s dilemma game, the payoffs
should satisfy the inequalities T > R > P > S and 2R > T+S.
Because of this game structure a dilemma appears – there is
no obvious best move. On one hand, the D choice is
dominant for both players – each player gets larger payoff
by choosing D than by choosing C no matter what the other
player chooses. On the other hand, the payoff for mutual
defection (P) is lower than the payoff if both players choose
their dominated C strategies (R for each player).
As PD game is used as a model for describing social
dilemmas and studying the phenomena of cooperation, there
is a great interest in the conditions that could promote or
diminish cooperation. The cooperation index (CI),
computed as CI = (R–P)/(T–S) (see Rapoport and
Chammah, 1965) is assumed to indicate the degree to which
a player can be motivated to cooperate (choose move C).
The disjunction effect in Prisoner’s Dilemma has attracted
considerable interest and has been investigated in several

comma separated payoffs are the Player I’s and Player II’s
payoffs, respectively.
Several explanations for the disjunction effect have been
put forward in the PD literature. Shafir and Tversky (1992)
are accounting for the disjunction effect using their theory
for reason-based choice: people need a reason in order to
make a choice. Thus, when they know that their opponent
will play C, they defect to get the higher payoff; and if they
know that she will play D, they defect in order to avoid the
lowest payoff and punish the opponent (see Figure 1). But
when the move of their opponent is not known, they don’t
have a particular reason to make a move and this changes
the situation contributing to the disjunction effect.
Additional explanations, discussed in the same paper, claim
that people cannot account properly for all alternatives of
the game, or if they do, due to the uncertainty about the
opponent’s move, they cannot establish clearly their own
preferences. Thus, depending on what outcome they focus
on, they can choose to cooperate or defect. When people are
made aware of their choices the disjunction effect
disappears (Tversky & Shafir, 1992).
An alternative explanation is related to the change of
participant’s perspective (individualistic vs. collectivistic)
about the PD game (see Shafir & Tversky, 1992). When

332

their opponent’s move is known, people can be tempted to
defect as the outcome of the game depends only on their
choice and they have to consider only one column in the
game matrix (see Figure 1). In this case, they adopt an
individualistic point of view and defect. On the other hand,
when the opponent’s move is unknown, they have to
consider the whole game matrix, the outcome depends on
their and their opponents moves, and the collectively
optimal decision of mutual cooperation becomes more
attractive. This is supported by the fact that the CC outcome
(payoff R) is better than the DD outcome (payoff P) for both
players (as R>P; see Figure 1).
Experiments show that sometimes participants act as if
they believe that their moves can influence the game
outcome, although they know this is impossible. In Shafir &
Tversky (1992), this is called quasi-magical thinking.
Quasi-magical thinking, applied to PD, would imply that if
people cooperate more when they are uncertain about the
other player move, this means that the CC outcome is
preferred by them, and by playing C they expect to elicit the
same choice in the other player.
In the account of Shafir & Tversky (1992), the possibility
of complexity to be an explanation of the disjunction effect
is discarded and it is claimed that ‘the failure to reason
consequentially may constitute a fundamental difference
between natural and artificial intelligence.’ Croson (1999)
tested the complexity explanation and the conclusion was
that complexity plays no role and the reason-based choice
explanation should hold. However, the test was performed
using games which are not dilemmas as the PD game.
Recently, inspired by the above conclusions, alternative
explanations have been put forward even involving quantum
probability theory and logic (see Busemeyer et al., 2006).
Li et al. (2007) used the so-called ‘equate-to-differentiate’
approach to explain the disjunction effect. This approach seems
to involve the complexity hypothesis by assuming that when
people have ambiguous alternatives concerning their own
payoffs, they can equate them and take the perspective of their
opponent. Moreover, the eye-tracking study of Hristova &
Grinberg (2008), has shown longer information acquisition in
PD games when the opponent’s move is uncertain than when it
is known by participants, reflecting the difference in the
complexity of the task in the two cases.
One of the goals of the present study is to explore to what
extent the complexity of decision making can lead to the
disjunction effect in PD games. The approach adopted here,
is different from the one followed in Croson (1999). Instead
of using games with different structure, in our experiments
we manipulated the payoffs by keeping their ratio and
cooperation index the same. Participants in one
experimental condition played PD games with payoffs
which were two digit numbers with the second number
different from zero. Participants in another experimental
condition, played games with two-digit numbers with the
second digit equal to zero. The idea was that, while
equivalent from a game-theoretical point of view, the
payoffs from the first condition are more difficult to

perceive and compare than the numbers in the second
condition. Thus, the complexity of the former case was
assumed to be higher than the complexity of the latter case.
The second goal was to try to evaluate the influence of
quasi-magical thinking discussed above on the disjunction
effect in PD games. This has been done by using exactly the
same experimental design as the one described above but
with an additional manipulation – a sentence in the
instruction which says that the computer program, playing
against the participants, had chosen its moves before the
beginning of the game session.
In both experiments eye-movements have been recorded in
the hope to discern differences in the four conditions which
could shed additional light on information processing involved
based on the experience of Hristova & Grinberg (2008).

Experiment 1 – Testing the complexity
explanation
Goals and hypothesis
The goal of the present experiment is to test the complexity
explanation for the disjunction effect, namely that the effect
appears because of the complexity of the game. When the
opponent’s move is not known, the situation is complex and
the players are not able to analyze it well and to choose the
appropriate move. To test this, in the current experiment we
manipulate the complexity of the payoffs that are presented.
The prediction is that if we make the game simpler (by
using simple round payoffs) the disjunction effect will be
smaller.

Stimuli
A set of 6 Prisoner’s dilemma games was used in the
experiment (see Table 1). Although the payoffs were
different, the cooperation index of all the games was equal
to 0.7 (as discussed above, cooperation index is an
important predictor of the cooperation rate). Three of the
games were with simple round payoffs, and 3 games were
with ‘complex’ payoffs.

Each of the 6 PD matrices was presented 3 times during the
game playing: the computer move in not known yet, the
computer move is known to be cooperation, the computer
move is known to be defection. These 18 payoff matrices that
are later used in the analysis were intermixed with 62 other
games resulting in a total of 80 games. The 18 PD games were
pseudo-randomly distributed between the 4th and the 78th game.

. Care was taken as one and the same PD game to appear in the
first, second, and third part of the game sequence. Playing
games with different strategic structure was used to introduce
the PD games as one-shot games and prevent subjects for using
strategies applicable in the repeated play of PD.

Eye Movements Recordings
Eye movements were recorded using the Tobii 1750 remote
binocular eye-tracker with 50 Hz sampling rate. The
accuracy of the gaze position record is about 0.5 degrees
visual angle. The game was presented on the Tobii monitor
(17”, 1280x1204 pixels). Each box containing payoffs or
moves occupied about 1 degree visual angle on the screen.
The distance between two adjacent boxes was at least 1
degree visual angle to ensure stable distinction between eyefixations belonging to respective zones. The schematic
game interface is presented in Figure 2.

choice. In fact the computer’s moves were randomly generated
in advance and were the same for all participants.

Participants
33 subjects with normal or corrected to normal vision took
part in study. Playing behavior of all subjects was analyzed,
however, due to technical difficulties, eye-tracking data of
only 22 of the subjects were analyzed.

Playing results
The number of cooperative choices for PD games was used as
a dependent variable characterizing the participants’ playing
and choices. If the disjunction effect is present, the cooperation
rate in the unknown move condition will be higher then either
the defect (D) or cooperate (C) known move condition. If no
disjunction effect is observed, the cooperation rate for the
unknown move condition is expected to be equal or between
the cooperation rates for D and C. This is the reason to compare
the unknown move condition against the known D and C
conditions separately and not against the aggregated data.
For the games with complex payoffs the expected pattern for
a disjunction effect appeared in the data (see Figure 3).
Participants cooperated in 27 % of the PD games in which the
computer move was not known, in 11 % of the games that the
computer move was known to be cooperation, and in 12 % of
the games that the computer move was known to be D
defection. Cooperation rate when the computer move is not
known is significantly different (p < 0.05) from the cooperation
rates when the computer move is known to be cooperation or
defection.

Procedure
After the eye-tracking calibration, subjects received
instructions and were tested for understanding the
instructions. Then each subject played 5 training games, and
next the 80 games described above.
The game was presented in a formal and a neutral
formulation. On the interface, the cooperation move was
labeled ‘1’ and the defection move was labeled ‘2’.
However, further in the paper, for convenience, we will
continue to use cooperation instead of move ‘1’ and
defection instead of move ‘2’.
Subjects were instructed to try to maximize their payoffs
and not to try to ‘beat’ the computer. After each game the
subjects got feedback about their and the computer’s choice
and payoffs in the current game. This information was visible
for 3 seconds and then the next game automatically appeared.
To ensure that players are following the instruction, three
participants that got most points were promised and given a
reward. In such a way we were trying to emphasize the
importance of getting more points (and not trying to get more
points than the opponent). Participants were not told their
total number of points until the end of the game.
It is explained to the participants that the computer makes its
choices trying to maximize the payoff in each game. They were
also told that the computer is not aware of the participant’s

not known (unknown); the computer’s move is known and it
is cooperation (move C); the computer’s move is known
and it is defection (move D). Error bars represent standard
error of the mean.
For the games with simple payoffs the disjunction effect
was not so prominent (see Figure 3). Participants cooperated
in 20 % of the PD games in which the computer move was
not known, in 16 % of the games that the computer move
was known to be cooperation, and in 6 % of the games that
the computer move was known to be defection. Although
the trend is present, there is no significant difference in the
cooperation rates when the computer move is unknown or

when the computer move is known to be cooperation.
Cooperation rate when the computer move is known be
defection is significantly different (p < 0.05) from the
cooperation rates when the computer move is not known or
is known to be cooperation.
In summary, when the payoffs were complex, a clear
disjunction effect appeared. However, the effect was not
statistically significant when the payoffs were simple. It
seems that these results support the complexity explanation
for the disjunction effect because change in the complexity
of the payoffs changes the participants’ choices and the
disjunction effect diminishes.

changed in both types of games (complex and simple).
When the computer’s move is D, the subject’s possible
payoffs are SS or PS and they do not pay attention to the
other payoffs (RS and TS). When the computer’s move is C,
the subject’s possible payoffs are RS or TS and they do not
pay attention to the other payoffs (SS and PS).

Eye-movements results
We defined several areas on the screen that are interesting in
studying information acquisition during PD game playing.
Each Area of Interest (AOI) contains the box in which the
information is presented and a small region around it. Here
we present the analysis of the eye-tracking data for the four
AOIs containing the subject’s possible payoffs These AOIs
are referred to as Ts, Rs, Ps, and Ss (see Figure 2). We used
the gaze-time (sum of all fixation durations on each AOI) as
a measure of attention devoted to it (Rayner, 1998).
We expect that when the computer’s move is known, the
subject’s attention will be directed to the possible payoffs
corresponding to the computer’s choice. So, for each game we
computed the aggregate gaze-times in the zones containing
subject’s possible payoff if the opponent cooperates (RS and
TS) and in the zones containing subject’s possible payoff if the
opponent defects (SS and PS). These data are analyzed in a
repeated-measures analysis of variance with the computer’s
move (not known, known to be cooperation, and known to be
defection) as a within-subject factor. Two such analyses were
performed: for the PD games with complex payoffs and for the
PD games with simple payoffs.
For the games with complex payoffs when subjects knew
that the computer’s move was defection they attended less
to the AOIs denoted as TS and RS compared to the games
when the computer’s move was not known (p = 0.018) or it
was known to be cooperation (p = 0.055) (see Figure 4).
When subjects knew that the computer’s move was
cooperation they attended less to the AOIs denoted as PS
and SS compared to the games when the computer’s move
was not known (p = 0.004) or when it was known to be
defection (p = 0.002) (see Figure 4).
For the games with simple payoffs when subjects knew
that the computer’s move was defection they attended less
to the AOIs denoted as TS and RS compared to the games
when the computer’s move was not known (p = 0.018) or it
was known to be cooperation (p = 0.02) (see Figure 4).
When subjects knew that the computer’s move was
cooperation they attended less to the AOIs denoted as PS
and SS compared to the games when the computer’s move
was not known (p < 0.001) or when it was known to be
cooperation (p < 0.001) (see Figure 4).
In summary, the eye-tracking data show that when the
opponent’s move is known, the eye-movement patterns are

move is not known (unknown); the computer’s move is
known and it is cooperation (move C); the computer’s move
is known and it is defection (move D). Error bars represent
standard error of the mean.
Another measure analyzed is the total gaze-time in the
four AOIs containing the subject’s possible payoffs. The
analysis shows that when the payoffs are complex players
spend more time looking at their them (mean 2270 ms) than
when the payoffs are simple (mean 1880 ms), p = 0.04. This
result indicates that simple payoffs are indeed easier to
process than the complex payoffs.

Summary and discussion for Experiment 1
All these results are in accordance with the complexity
explanation of the disjunction effect. When complexity of
the PD game is reduced (by using payoff that are easy to
process) the disjunction effect is reduced. Eye-movements
data also support this explanation. When the computer’s
move is known, the eye-movement patterns are changed –
players are paying less attention to the payoffs that are not
relevant for the already revealed opponent’s move. Eyemovement data also give evidence that the intended
reduction in complexity of the game is successful.

Experiment 2 – Testing the quasi-magical
thinking explanation
Goals and hypothesis
The goal of this experiment is to test the explanation that the
disjunction effect arises due to the so called ‘quasi-magical
thinking’. The explanation is that the players behave as if
they believe that their choices could influence the other

335

player’s choices (although they know that in fact the other
player is not aware of their choice while making his).
To test this explanation in this experiment we use a novel
manipulation consisting in telling the subjects that the
computer’s moves are determined in advance. When this
fact is known the above stated ‘quasi-magical beliefs’
should be diminished and the disjunction effect should
disappear.

Stimuli and Procedure
Game and procedure were the same as in experiment 1.
Change was made only in the information given to the
participants in regard to the computer’s move. It is said not
only that the computer tries to maximize its payoff in each
game but also that the computer has determined all of its
moves in advance, before the start of the sequence of 80
games.

Participants
27 subjects with normal or corrected to normal vision took
part in study. Playing behavior of all subjects was analyzed,
however, due to technical difficulties, eye-tracking data of
only 16 of the subjects were analyzed.

Playing results
For the games with complex payoffs participants cooperated
in 21 % of the PD games in which the computer move was
not known, in 12 % of the games that the computer move
was known to be cooperation, and in 7 % of the games that
the computer move was known to be defection (see Figure
5). Cooperation rate when the computer move is not known
is significantly different (p < 0.05) from the cooperation rate
when the computer move is known to be defection. All
other differences are non-significant. Although the trend is
present, there is no significant difference in the cooperation
rates when the computer move is unknown or when the
computer move is known to be cooperation.

For the games with simple payoffs no disjunction effect
was found (see Figure 5). Participants cooperated in 14 % of
the PD games in which the computer move was not known,
in 16 % of the games that the computer move was known to
be cooperation, and in 10 % of the games that the computer
move was known to be defection. There is no significant
difference between these three cooperation levels.
In summary, when the players know that the computer
moves are determined before the start of the sequence of
games, the disjunction effect is smaller or absent. Especially
when the PD games payoffs are easy to be processed and
compared, no such effect is observed.

Eye-movements results
For the games with complex payoffs when subjects knew that
the computer’s move was cooperation they attended more to
the AOIs denoted as TS and RS compared to the games when
the computer’s move is not known (p = 0.009) and it is known
to be defection (p = 0.003). They also attended less to the AOIs
denoted as PS and SS compared to the games when the
computer’s move is not known (p < 0.001) and it is known to
be defection (p < 0.001) (see Figure 6).
For the games with simple payoffs, when subjects knew
that the computer’s move was D, they attended less to the
AOIs denoted as TS and RS compared to the games when the
computer’s move was not known (p = 0.044) and when it
was known to be C (p = 0.08). They also attended less to the
AOIs denoted as PS and SS compared to the games when the
computer’s move was not known (p = 0.001) and when it
was known to be C (< 0.044) (see Figure 6).

error of the mean.

In summary, the eye-tracking data show that in both types
of games (complex and simple) the eye-movement patterns
are changed. When the computer’s move is known, the
subjects pay more attention to their possible payoffs in the
corresponding column and they don’t pay attention to the
other payoffs.

Again we analyzed the total gaze-time in the four AOIs
containing the subject’s possible payoffs. The analysis shows
that when the payoffs are complex players spend more time
looking at their payoffs (mean 1525 ms) than when the
payoffs are simple (mean 1309 ms), p = 0.036. Total gaze
time in these four AOIs is less in Experiment 2 (mean 1417
ms) than in Experiment 1 (mean 2079 ms), p = 0.034.

Summary and discussion for Experiment 2
As expected, when the subjects are told that the computer
moves are already decided, the disjunction effect is reduced
and even disappears when games with lower complexity are
played. These results are in accordance with the quasimagical thinking explanation of the disjunction effect and
also give further support for the complexity explanation.

Discussion and Conclusions
The paper presents an experimental study of the
disjunction effect in PD games based on behavioral
experiments with eye-movement recordings. The
experiments were designed to explore the complexity
hypothesis about the appearance of the disjunction effect
which seems to have little support in the literature.
However, our study showed that without changing the
structure of the game (and its cooperation index), but by just
using payoffs which can be easily processed, the disjunction
effect can disappear. We interpret this result as an indication
that despite the arguments and evidences that have been
discussed in the literature (see Shafir & Tversky, 1992; and
Croson, 1999) the role of complexity should not be
underestimated and deserves further attention and
exploration.
One possible interpretation of the findings from
Experiment 1 can be that participants have difficulties in the
comparison of alternatives in the complex payoff condition
and cannot come out with clear preferences. In the simple
payoff condition, outcome comparison is simpler and
participants can chose their move in a similar way as when
the move of their opponent is known.
In the second experiment, the participants were told that
the moves of the computer opponent had been made before
the game session. Such a manipulation hasn’t been used
before. This manipulation led again to the disappearance of
the disjunction effect even in the complex payoff condition.
We interpret this result as a suppressing of a possible quasimagic reasoning by stressing the fact that participants own
moves cannot influence the move of the opponent.
Interestingly, the manipulation led also to considerable
decrease in the payoff processing time which deserves
further exploration.
The results from the two experiments point to information
processing complexity as a major factor for the disjunction
effect contrary to the conclusions in previous research.
The eye-movement data support the complexity
explanation described above. They show a change in the
dynamics of the information acquisition in relation to the
experimental manipulations of the complexity of the

payoffs, and of the information about the opponent’s move.
As has been suggested in Busemeyer et al. (1993), the
deliberation process can play a crucial role in decision
making, especially when participants cannot attend at once
to the full information available but can compare
alternatives based on selected features.
A further systematic experimental and theoretical
investigation of the results presented in this paper is under
way and will be presented in the future.
