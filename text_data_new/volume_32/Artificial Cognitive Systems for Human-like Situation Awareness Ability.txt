Abstract: The Artificial Cognitive Systems (ACS) will be investigated for human-like functions such as vision,
auditory, inference, and behavior. Especially, computational models and artificial HW/SW systems will be devised
for Proactive Knowledge Development (PKD) and Self-Identity (SI). The PKD model provides bilateral interactions
between robot and unknown environment (people, other robots, cyberspace). For the situation awareness in unknown
environment it is required to receive audio-visual signals and to accumulate knowledge. If the knowledge is not enough,
the PKD should improve by itself though internet and others. For human-oriented decision making it is also required
for the robot to have self-identify and emotion. Finally, the developed models and system will be mounted on a
robot for the human-robot co-existing society. Based on the computational models of PKD and SI, we would like to
build functional modules for Knowledge Represenation, Knowledge Accumulation , Situation Awareness, Decision
Making, and Human Behavior.
