If distracters happen to have sufficient match with some of
the studied items in memory, this produces a false alarm to
the distracter. The REM model, as well as other globalmatching type models (see Clark & Gronlund (1996) for a
review), are classified as item-noise models due to the fact
that interference is produced by the content and number of
studied items.
BCDMEM, in contrast, assumes that during the study
phase, each item isn't stored but is instead bound to the
study context. During the test phase, the probe item cues all
previous contexts in which the item was studied in,
including learned elements of the study context.
Additionally, the context of the study episode is reinstated.
This reinstated context is then compared against the
retrieved contexts of the item to evaluate whether or not the
item was presented during the experiment, and a sufficient
degree of match between the elements of the study context
and matching elements in the retrieved contexts produces a
yes response. If a distracter item happens to have been
experienced in a large number of contexts, such as a high
frequency word in the English language, then it is more
likely for the retrieved context layer to spuriously contain
elements of the study context and a false alarm can be
produced. Consequently, this model is classified as a
context-noise model because previous contexts are the
principal source of interference.
Because these models account for the same effects using
different sources of information and interference,
determining which model is correctly representing the
memory system requires looking at more current evidence
in the literature. Dennis and Chapman (in press) recently
found that when list length was varied between 10 and 80
items but the number of categories was kept constant
(essentially varying the number of exemplars per category),

Abstract
An experiment by Dennis and Chapman (in press) found that as the
length of a categorized list of materials increased, the false alarms
to unrelated distracters decreased, a finding suggesting that adults
are best described by context-noise models of recognition memory.
Developmental evidence demonstrating that children the age of
five are more sensitive to item information suggests that children
might be described by item-noise models. We tested children and
adults’ performance and eye movements during recognition and
found that adults’ usage of category context was evident in both
their performance and in their eye movements. Children, however,
did not give conclusive evidence in their memory performance but
their eye movements did not reflect usage of category context.

Introduction
Current models of recognition memory, such as the REM
model (Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997) and the BCDMEM
model (Dennis & Humphreys, 2001) are capable of making
accurate predictions about a number of previously
problematic effects in the literature, such as the list-strength
effect (Ratcliff, Clark, and Shiffrin, 1990) and the mirror
effect (Glanzer and Adams, 1985). However, these models
not only possess different architectures but also capture the
same trends in the data using different sources of
information and interference.
The REM model assumes that during the study phase,
each item is stored as a separate, noisy representation.
During the test phase, a probe item is compared against
every item in memory and an activation value is calculated
based on the degree of match between each studied item and
the presented probe item. These activation values are then
averaged and a mean activation value that is sufficient
(exceeding a fixed criterion value) produces a yes response.

false alarms to unrelated distracter items were lower in the
long list relative to the short list. This qualitative trend was
dubbed the 'inverse list length effect,' which is the opposite
of the predictions of the REM model. REM predicts a slight
increase to unrelated distracters with increased list length, as
extra study items produce additional noise during
recognition. However, this effect can be handled by the
BCDMEM model with the assumption that when
participants are reinstating the context of the study episode,
the categories learned while studying the long list become a
part of the reinstated study context. These added elements of
category context are then matched to the category contexts
cued by the items, producing higher likelihoods of a "yes"
response for matching category items and lower likelihoods
of "yes" responses for mismatching category items. The
authors further argue that it would be impossible for the
REM model or virtually any other model that solely relies
on information from individual exemplars to capture this
effect.
There exist developmental evidence, however, that
suggest that the source of interference may change through
development. Sloutsky and Fisher (2004) conducted an
experiment in which participants, which consisted of adults
and children the age of five, either participated in a
categorization task in which they had to induce a novel
category property to animal photos, or they participated in a
baseline condition in which they merely studied the photos.
A surprise recognition task followed either of the two
conditions, and it was found that adults experienced a sharp
decrement in their ability to discriminate between studied
and non-studied category items due to an increase in false
alarms to related distracters. Children, in contrast,
experienced no such decrement in their memory
performance between the two conditions. The authors
attribute this dissociation in performance between the two
age groups to the fact that adults are much more sensitive to
category-based information, while children are much more
sensitive to item-based information.
These findings are consistent with a large number of
findings from the research review performed by Brainerd,
Reyna, and Ceci (2008). In this review, a number of
experiments were discussed in which it was demonstrated
that children are much less susceptible to false memory
errors, a pattern which increases with age up until
adulthood. These effects and age trends were evident in
paradigms ranging from DRM type tasks to suggestibility
experiments. The authors attribute these errors, particularly
the decreased likelihood of recalling or falsely recognizing
items highly similar to items presented at test, to children’s
weaker ability to spontaneously extract gist from the test
materials in the same manner as adults.
We argue that if children are indeed more focused on
item information and are weaker in their ability to extract
gist during the study phase, then they should be deficient in
their ability to extract and reinstate category context in the
same manner as adults. We tested this by running both
adults and children in a paradigm very similar to that used

by Dennis and Chapman (in press). If our hypothesis about
children's inability to use context is correct, then they should
be unable to exhibit an inverse list length effect and their
performance may follow the predictions of item-noise
models of recognition. Adults, in contrast, should behave
consistently with previous findings and experience
facilitation in their ability to reject unrelated distracters in
the long list condition.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants Participants were 65 children (33 female and
32 male, M = 4.87 years, SD = 0.61 years) and 83 adults (36
women and 47 men, M = 19.7 years, SD = 2.93 years).
Child participants were recruited from suburbs in
Columbus, OH. Adult participants consisted of
undergraduate students from The Ohio State University
participating for course credit.

each of the 8 presented categories and using reshuffled
combinations of previously presented shapes and colors for
the body, hands, and feet. Unrelated distracters were
constructed in the same manner as related distracters, except
that the heads were not categorically related to the presented
stimuli and instead were composed of new combinations of
shapes and colors that were not presented at test (all
remaining colors and shapes not sampled for the study
items). It should be noted that all shapes and colors have an
equal probability of being used in target, related distracter,
and unrelated distracter items. Examples of possible
distracter item composites can be seen in Figure 3.
The stimuli were presented on the center of the computer
screen. All stimuli and tasks in the experiment were
controlled by E-Prime 2.0 Professional software.

Stimuli Visual stimuli consisted of artificial creatures that
were composed of four different body parts: a head, a body,
a pair of hands, and a pair of feet. Each body part was
composed of a unique color and shape pairing. The
creatures were assembled by randomly selecting a shape and
a color for each component from a selection of over 16
different colors (common to all body parts) and 16 different
shapes (unique to each body part). All shape and color
features are detailed in Figure 1.

related distracter item, featuring an identical head as the
above category exemplars. Right: an unrelated distracter,

Procedure Upon arrival, participants were randomly
selected into either the short list condition or the long list
condition. Participants were then briefed about the stimuli
they would be viewing. They were given incidental
learning conditions, in that they were told to look at the
stimuli and make a decision as to whether each stimulus was
scary or funny, but were not told that they would be tested
on their memory later in the experiment. During the study
phase of the experiment, each exemplar was presented on
the screen for 4500 ms while evaluating the exemplar to
make the decision described above. Adult participants gave
their responses by pressing keys on the keyboard while
child participants gave their responses verbally to the
experimenter, who then recorded the response on the
keyboard. Each exemplar was preceded by a fixation cross
which appeared for 500 ms.
To control for the different retention intervals between
the short and long list, after completing the study phase of
the experiment, both the short and long lists were followed
by a distracter task that took place for 340 seconds for the
short list and 60 seconds for the long list. The distracter task
consisted of a rhythm game where participants listened to a
sequence of 4 drumbeats and were then asked to tap out the
sequence on the spacebar of the keyboard at the same tempo
that the beats had played.

For the study phase of the short list, a total of 8 exemplars
were presented to the participant with unique shapes and
colors for the different components (head, body, hands, and
feet). For the study phase of the long list, 64 exemplars were
presented and blocked into 8 categories of 8 exemplars
each. Categories were defined as exemplars which shared
heads of the same shape and color while the hands, feet, and
body of the shared category exemplars consisted of different
shape and color combinations. All categories exhibited
unique, non-overlapping shape and color combinations for
the heads. For the body, hands, and feet, all categories used
the same colors and shapes (all randomly selected from the
16 available), no shape/color combinations were reused
between categories and no shapes or colors were used for
more than one exemplar within a given category. It should
also be mentioned that the same number of features were
used in both the short and long list conditions. Examples of
possible exemplars created for short lists and long lists can
be seen in Figure 2.
Distracter items in the test list were divided into two
types: related distracters and unrelated distracters. Related
distracters were constructed by selecting one head from

844

After completing the distracter task, participants were
then instructed that they would be tested on their memory of
the items from the study condition. Participants were
instructed to respond “yes” if they recognized the item from
the study phase, or to respond “no” if they did not recognize
the item. The adult participants were instructed to give their
responses on the keyboard while the children gave verbal
responses to the experimenter who recorded the responses
on the keyboard.
The test list consisted of 24 items: 8 of which were target
items drawn from the study list, 8 of which were related
distracters, and 8 of which were unrelated distracters. For
the long list, each target item and related distracter was
selected from each of the separate categories with no
category being sampled more than once, such that all
categories were represented on the test list.
Adult participants were tested in a laboratory at the
university. Child participants were tested in local daycares
or preschools by trained adult experimenters.

Planned post-hoc comparisons revealed a significant
difference in adults’ related false alarm rates across the two
conditions (t = 24.05, p < .001), a difference which was
insignificant for children (t = 2.01, p > .05). This replicates
the findings of Sloutsky and Fisher (2004) but does not
distinguish between the two models of recognition memory
we’re comparing against. Thus, planned post-hoc
comparisons were also calculated on the differences in
unrelated false alarms between the two list conditions for
both adults and children, and revealed insignificant
differences for both age groups (adults: t = 1.16, children: t
= .04, ps > .05). Thus, neither age group revealed an inverse
list length effect in their memory performance. However,
there were differences in the groups’ reaction times.

d’ scores were calculated as a measure of memory

sensitivity for all participants. Since we were most
principally interested in the usage of the head information in
making recognition judgments, only hits and false alarms to
unrelated distracters were used in the calculations. Edge
corrections were performed by adding 0.5 to the hit and
unrelated false alarm counts and 1 to the target and
unrelated distracter counts, as hit rates of 1.0 or false alarm
rates of 0.0 produce infinite values for d’ (Snodgrass &
Corwin, 1988). Participants with d’ less than or equal to 0
were excluded from the analysis (7 children and 4 adults).
Hits, false alarms to related distracters, and false alarms to
unrelated distracters are summarized in Table 1.

To counteract positive skew in reaction time data, we
took the median of each participant’s reaction times for each
of the 8 trials of every item type. The means of these median
RTs can be seen in Table 2. We subjected the RTs to a
repeated measures analysis of variance with list condition
and age group as between subjects factors and item type as a
within subjects factor. Results indicated a significant main
effect of age, F(2, 405) = 235.4, p < .001. Planned post-hoc
comparisons were also calculated on the RT differences
between the two conditions for each item type and for each
age. Significant differences between the two list conditions
were found in adults for related distracters (t = 2.95) and
unrelated distracters (t = 3.75), ps < .01. No significant
differences in reaction times were found between the two
list conditions in children, however it should be mentioned
that children’s responses were recorded by an experimenter
and are thus difficult to interpret.
Because adults in the long list are quicker to react to
unrelated distracters without receiving any decrement in
accuracy, it is clear that they are in fact receiving a
facilitation in rejecting unrelated distracters, which is not
only contrary to the predictions of item-noise models but in
accordance with the context-noise approach. However, this
evidence does not give us any indication as to which model
describes children’s memory judgments. For this, we
decided to run the same experiment in an eye tracker as a
way of measuring the information that is being used in the
test phase. Considering that the head is the most relevant
feature of an unrelated distracter, the clearest prediction that
can be made is that participants that have successfully
abstracted the category context in the long list will look

A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
conducted on the responses for each subject, with list
condition (short vs. long) and age group (adults vs. children)
as between subjects factors and item type (target vs. related
distracter vs. unrelated distracter) as a within subjects factor.
Results indicated a significant main effect of item type, F(2,

short list condition.

dependent measure we selected was the proportion of looks
at the head, which was calculated for each item type. These
results can be seen in Table 3. Because trials continued until
participants gave their responses, with some trials
continuing for as long as 10 seconds, the calculation was
restricted from the start of the trial up until the mean
reaction time (2 seconds for adults and 3 seconds for
children).

Participants Participants were 34 children (15 female and
19 male, M = 5.25 years, SD = 0.60 years) and 43 adults (18
female and 25 male, M = 19.5 years, SD = 1.29 years),
participated in this experiment. Child participants were
recruited from suburbs in Columbus, OH. Adult participants
consisted of undergraduate students from The Ohio State
University participating for course credit.

Apparatus Eye gazes were measured using a Tobii T60 eye
tracker with a sampling rate of 60 Hz (60 data points
collected per second). The device is integrated into a 17inch monitor within a testing booth. A camera adjacent to
the eye tracker provided a live feed to a trained
experimenter at a nearby computer, who was able to
monitor both the participant’s eye movements as well as the
stimuli they were viewing.

Considering that there is no category information in the
short list (there were no repetitions of category exemplars),
we interpreted looks at the head in the short list as a baseline
degree of looking when only item information is available.
Since the test phase is identical in both list conditions, any
increase in looking at the head in the long list above that of
the short list has to be due to differences in the study phase,
most notably the repetitions of category exemplars.
Visualizations of the looks at the head over time can be
found in Figures 4 and 5.

Procedure The procedure was nearly identical to that of
Experiment 1 with the exception of a couple of minor
adaptations to make this experiment compatible with the
usage of an eye tracker. Each stimulus component (head,
body, hands, and feet) was given a pre-determined area of
interest (AOI) for recording eye gaze movements. To keep
participants visual attention, we used a gaze-contingent
fixation point between all trials in both the study phase and
the test phase such that a stimulus would only be presented
if participants maintained their gaze on the fixation point for
a randomly calculated time interval between 300 and 700
ms. Additionally, since the stimulus appears in the center of
the screen, the fixation point was randomly presented in the
center of one of four quadrants on the screen to ensure that
first looks were not biased by the fixation position.
All participants, including both adults and children, were
run by trained adult experimenters at a nearby computer
throughout the duration of the experiment. Because trials
continue until a response is given, allowing adults to enter
their own responses on a keyboard and having children’s
responses be entered by an experimenter will yield different
patterns of data for the two groups. To make the data
comparable between the two age groups, both adults and
children gave all responses to the experimenter who entered
them on a keyboard.

Results and Discussion
d’ scores were calculated in the same manner as
Experiment 1 and all participants with d’ scores less than or
equal to 0 were excluded from the analysis (2 adults and 4
children).
Because the head was the category relevant feature, all
analyses were restricted to that area of interest. The

Figure 4: Differences in proportions of looking at the head
target and related distracter presentations for both children
and adults recorded at each refresh rate (every 16.6 ms).
T-tests were calculated on the differences between the
two list conditions for each item type to determine if the

differences in looking were significant. For adults,
differences between the two lists were insignificant for both
target items (t(39) = .90, p > .05) and related distracters
(t(39) = -.53, p > .05). This is not surprising, considering
that for both target and related distracter items, the head is
not diagnostic of whether or not the item was on the list.
This is not the case for unrelated distracters, where the
category information (i.e.: the head) is the most relevant
feature for discrimination. A t-test between the two list
conditions for unrelated distracters was significant (t(39) =
2.39, p < .05), in that adults looked significantly longer at
the head in the long list condition relative to the short list
condition.
For children, differences between the two list conditions
for target items (t(28) = -.76, p > .05), related distracters
(t(28) = -.46, p > .05), and most importantly, unrelated
distracters (t(28) = 1.97, p > .05) were all insignificant.
Because children in the long list condition were not using
the category relevant information above and beyond that of
the short list, we interpret this to mean that category context
information was not being accessed above and beyond that
of item information. However, considering that this p-value
is close to the significance margin, it is possible that there
are subsets of children showing the effect that are
outnumbered by children not showing the effect.

adults recorded at each refresh rate (every 16.6 ms).

Conclusions
To summarize, for adults, increasing category length not
only facilitated the rejection of non-category items but this
facilitation manifested itself in a bias for category relevant
features in their eye movements. For children, no such
facilitation could be found in either their behavioral data or
in their eye movements, implying that they may be meeting
the predictions of the item-noise models of recognition
memory.
We believe this is important research because despite
there being a large volume of research on developmental
differences in episodic memory, there has been little work
connecting these differences to the components and
processes of current memory models. We hope that this
work as well as future work will make clear connections
between the developmental literature and the modeling
