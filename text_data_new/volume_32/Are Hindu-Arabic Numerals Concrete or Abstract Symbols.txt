Are Hindu-Arabic Numerals Concrete or Abstract Symbols?
Percival Matthews
Vanderbilt University
Abstract: Much recent experimental work has investigated the comparative merits of concrete versus abstract
instantiations of to-be-learned concepts for promoting learning and transfer in complex domains. A critical question,
however, is what exactly counts as a concrete instantiation. Using a design similar to that of Sloutsky, Kaminski, &
Heckler (2005), the current experiments provide findings that suggest that Arabic numerals have effects that parallel
those of perceptually concrete instantiations when used to illustrate the domain of modular arithmetic. Specifically,
numerals can be used to speed initial learning within the domain, but impede transfer relative to more abstract
instantiations of the same underlying content. Moreover, these effects can be moderated by subtle warm-up tasks
that affect the degree to which these numerals activate prior arithmetic schemas. These results suggest that the
current conception of ”concrete” should be expanded to include representations typically thought to lie outside of
the realm of concrete.
