Abstract
The present study investigated the role of restructuring in
the solution of insight and incremental problems.
Participants were presented with a series of insight and
algebra word problems in a hindsight bias paradigm
(Fischoff, 1975).
Those who solved the insightful
problems correctly showed increases in importance ratings
on the key problem components. However, no increases in
importance ratings were detected for the key problem
components of algebra problems. These results are
consistent with theories that propose that representational
restructuring plays a fundamental role in the insightful
problem solving process (Davidson & Sternberg, 1984;
Ohlsson, 1992).

Restructuring and Insightful Problem
Solving
A number of researchers have suggested that insight
problems may be solved in a qualitatively different
manner from incremental or analytic problems (Duncker,
1945, Davidson & Sternberg, 1984, Metcalfe & Wiebe,
1987, Ohlsson, 1992). For example, when Metcalfe and
Wiebe (1987) had subjects make feeling of warmth
ratings while solving algebra and insight problems, they
found that while solving algebra problems, subjects’
warmth ratings steadily increased towards the time of
solution; whereas during the solution of insight problems
subjects’ warmth ratings remained low and suddenly
increased right before they solved the problem. These
results suggest the processes for solving insight problems
are different from the systematic or analytical processes
used for incremental problems. However, this only
represents the suddenness of the insightful process and
does not shed light on the causes of the solution patterns.
It has been suggested that insight problems differ from
incremental problems in that the nature of the solvers’
experience causes them to construct a representation of
the problem that cannot lead to the correct solution
(Duncker, 1945, Davidson & Sternberg, 1984, Ohlsson,
1992). In order to come to the correct solution, solvers
must restructure their original conception of the problem.
Proposed evidence for restructuring in insight problem
solving has come from a wide range of empirical findings.
For example, Dominowski and Buyer (2000) found
decreases in re-solution time for those who correctly solve
insight problems but not for those who were simply
shown the answer. Knoblich, Ohlsson, and Raney (2001)

analyzed eye movements during the solution of
matchstick arithmetic problems and found evidence for
impasses followed by increased fixations on components
of the problems that were key to solution. Durso,
Cornelia, and Dayton (1994) attempted to find an
independent measure of restructuring by statistically
modeling successful and unsuccessful problem
representations after the problem solving session. They
found that successful solvers representations centered on
concepts key to the nature of the solution, whereas nonsolvers representations centered on the principle
characters in the story problem, which were not relevant
to the solution.
These empirical studies suggest an insight problem
solving process that involves the restructuring of the
mental problem representation. However, these studies
fall short of proving the existence of a restructuring
process because they fail to directly measure
representational change before and after solving across an
individual and fail to compare problems that involve
incremental solutions to the problems proposed to elicit
insightful solutions. What is needed is an independent
measure of restructuring in order to test theories that
predict an insight process involving restructuring against
theories which do not predict restructuring in any problem
solving process (such as Weisberg’s nothing special view,
1986). Furthermore, this method must be able to directly
test whether more restructuring is involved in insightful
than incremental problem solving. The present study uses
a hindsight bias paradigm to produce an independent
measure of the amount of restructuring involved in
solving different types of problems.

Hindsight Bias
Hindsight bias is the observation that people with
outcome knowledge of a situation falsely believe that they
would have predicted the correct outcome (Hawkins &
Hastie, 1990). Fischoff (1975) originally developed the
basic paradigm. He had people read a narrative of a
situation with or without receiving the outcome and then
had them rate the probability of alternate outcomes as if
they had no knowledge of the outcome. The general
finding is that people with outcome knowledge
unknowingly rate the outcome they were told as more
probable than alternatives, as if they “knew it all along.”
Individuals who receive outcome knowledge also rate the
sentences in the narrative that support the given outcome

as more important than those that do not, even though
they are asked to ignore the given outcome. This same
effect has also been shown in within-subject studies in
which participants are asked to rate outcomes before they
receive outcome information, and then asked to reproduce
their original questionnaire ratings after receiving
outcome information (Fischoff & Beyth, 1975). Most
research suggests that hindsight bias is not due to
motivational factors but involves cognitive processes that
automatically restructure one’s situation representation to
accommodate the new information, leaving individuals
unable to access or reproduce their original representation
(Hawkins & Hastie, 1990).
This leads to the hypothesis that processes that cause
more restructuring will lead to more hindsight bias.
Restructuring theories of insightful problem solving make
clear predictions about the nature of hindsight bias for
insightful problems. If correctly solving insight problems
involves restructuring of the problem space to come to a
solution, then those who correctly solve insight problems
should show hindsight bias on the problem components
that are key to solution. However, those who fail to
correctly solve the insight problems should not show any
hindsight bias on those components.
If this restructuring occurs only as a result of an
insightful problem solving process, then being shown the
solution should not lead to hindsight bias of a similar
nature to those who solve on their own. Algebra problems
should be solved in an incremental fashion. Therefore,
restructuring theories of insightful problem solving would
predict no hindsight bias on the key components of
algebra problems regardless of correctness of solution or
being shown the answer. Finally, the “nothing special” or
gradual transformation theory of insightful problem
solving (Weisberg, 1986) predicts no differences in
between insightful and incremental solution processes.
Therefore, this theory would predict no difference in
hindsight bias between insight and algebra problems or
those who come to solution, and those who do not come
to solution but are shown the correct answers.
The present study consisted of two sessions.
Participants received a series of insight and algebra word
problems. During session one, Ss first were asked to read
through each problem carefully and rate each component
of the problem on its importance in finding the solution.
Then they were asked to attempt to solve each problem.
Following the solution phase approximately half the Ss
were shown the correct solution. After a one week
interval Ss returned for the second session. At this time
they were asked to attempt to remember their original
importance ratings for each of the problem components.
Hindsight bias was measured as the change in importance
ratings between the two sessions, in favor of relevance for
solution.

Methods
Participants. One hundred twenty eight introductory
psychology students participated in this study to fulfill a
class requirement. They were run in groups of 3 to 12.

Design. This study consisted of two one-hour sessions
separated by a one-week interval. During the first session
Ss rated the importance of the problem components of
several insight and algebra problems.
Next they
attempted to solve each problem. After attempting to
solve, half the groups were shown the solution. After a
one-week interval Ss returned and were asked to
reproduce their original component importance ratings.
This resulted in a 2 session rating (session 1, session 2) X
2 shown answer (Yes, NO) X 3 solution type (no solution,
incorrect, correct) X N components (varies by problem)
mixed design. Session rating and problem components
were within-subject variables, while shown answer and
solution type were grouped between subjects.
Materials and Procedure. Participants completed the
S1Q booklet first. The S1Q booklet consisted of six
insight problems and four algebra word problems. Ss
were instructed to carefully read each problem, but not to
attempt to solve the problems. Instead, Ss were asked to
rate each sentence or component of the problem on how
important it is in finding the solution to the problem.
Each sentence or component of the problem was listed
one at a time followed by a rating scale that consisted of a
7.3 cm continuum. The far left side of the continuum was
marked as representing “very unimportant,” while the far
right side was marked “very important.” Participants
were instructed to make a mark anywhere on the
continuum that best represented their opinion of the
particular problem component. Participants were allowed
to work through the questionnaire booklet at their own
pace but were allowed no more than 15 min. to complete
all the ratings. The experimenter periodically reminded
participants not to attempt to solve the problems
throughout the rating phase. These ratings are the session
1 importance ratings.
Next participants completed the problem-solving
packet (S1S). The S1S booklet presented the same 10
problems, each on its own page. Ss were instructed to
attempt to solve each problem and that they would be
given three minutes to complete each problem. The
directions instructed the Ss to show all work, circle their
final answer, and if necessary explain the solution using a
few short sentences. Ss were instructed to work through
the booklet in order, stop working on a problem at the
experimenter’s signal, and wait until the experimenter’s
signal to begin the next problem. Ss were given 3 min. to
work on each problem. The Ss performance each
problem was used to assign participant into one of three
solution type groups (no answer, incorrect, correct) for
each problem.
After attempting to solve all the problems, half of the
groups were dismissed (shown answer no). The other half
(shown answer yes) were shown step-by-step outlines of
the solutions of each of the problems on an overhead
projector. The experimenter read a script that explained
each answer.
Each problem explanation took
approximately 1 min. At the conclusion of session 1 Ss
were asked not to discuss the details of any of the

problems they saw or their solutions with anyone else in
the Subject Pool and dismissed.
Session 2 occurred exactly one-week later in the same
room at the same time. Ss were first issued the second
session questionnaire packet (S2Q). This packet was
identical to the first except that the participants were
asked to attempt to reproduce their exact component
importance ratings from the first experiment. These
ratings are the Session 2 importance ratings. They were
once again allowed to work through the booklet at their
own pace but had no more than 15 min. to complete the
entire memory test. Then, Ss once again attempted to
solve each problem in the same manner as in session 1.
Finally, participants were debriefed as to the nature of the
study and once again asked not to discuss the study,
problems, or solutions with anyone else in the Subject
Pool.

Results
Two algebra and two insight problems from the set of
problems were chosen for the problem component
analysis. These problems were selected on the basis of
two criteria. The first criterion was due to a conceptual
constraint.
Each problem component or individual
sentence had to contain only either information that was
key to the solution or not. In other words, any one
component of a problem must have been mutually
exclusive from the other components and contain unique
information that was only interpretable as important or
unimportant depending on one’s interpretation of the
problem.
The second constraint was a practical
constraint. Each problem had to result in a moderate
solution rate such that there would be a number of
individuals in each of the solution type groups, and result
in a similar number of individuals for each solution type
across “answer shown” groups. The two insight and two
algebra problems that best met these criteria were selected
for analysis. The problems are presented in Figures 1-4,
problem components are indicated by lower case letters.
The number of participants in each cell for each problem
is listed in Table 1.
Problem Component Ratings Problem component
scores were coded by measuring the distance of the
participants’ mark on the continuum from the left end
with a ruler. Lower scores indicate that a sentence or
component in a problem was perceived as of little

importance toward the correct solution, while higher
scores indicate that a sentence or component in a problem
is perceived of great importance in coming to the correct
solution. Hindsight bias is the increase of an individual’s
importance rating for a solution-related problem
component between the first and second sessions.
Restructuring theories of insightful problem solving
predict that on insight problems, initial component
importance ratings should reflect solvers’ activation of an
inappropriate problem representation.
Those who
overcome the impasse and correctly solve the problems
need to restructure their representation of the problem to
activate the correct operators or components for solution.
This new representation should lead to hindsight bias in
the importance ratings for the key components of the
problem.
Those who fail to solve the problem should show no
hindsight bias for key problem components, and may even
increase their importance ratings for the original
inappropriate components of the problem. In algebra
problems no restructuring of the problem representation is
necessary to come to solution, therefore no change in
representation of the problem should be evident in the
hindsight bias measures of algebra word problem
components.

Train Algebra Problem The train problem (see Figure 1)
involves constructing and solving equations in order to
find how many hours it will take for two trains to be 800
miles apart. To solve this problem one must use
information from sentences (components) A, C, D, and E.
These sentences are therefore the key components in this
problem. To investigate whether restructuring was
involved in solving this algebra problem, a 2x5x2x3
(session x component x answer given condition x solution
type (no solution, incorrect solution, correct solution))
ANOVA was conducted. Evidence for restructuring as
measured by hindsight bias is revealed by interactions
involving the session variable. Specifically, an increase
in importance ratings on key components across sessions
(initial rating vs. second rating) for those who correctly
solve the problem is evidence for restructuring.
This analysis revealed a significant session x
component x solution type interaction F (8, 484) = 2.69, p
< .05, n2 = .04. Follow-up analysis revealed that this
small interaction was due to significant decreases in
importance ratings on component D, and E for those who
answered incorrectly and were shown the answer (t (26) =
-3.71, p < .01, & t (26) = -2.78, p < .01 respectively).
There was also a significant decrease in importance rating
on component E for those who answered correctly and
were shown the solution, t (29) = -3.21, p < .01 (see Table
2). If restructuring of the problem representation was
necessary to solve this algebra problem one would expect
to see increases in importance ratings on components A,
C, D and E for those who correctly solve. This was not
the case. Clearly there is no evidence of restructuring in
those who solved the train algebra problem.
Age Algebra Problem The Ann and Son problem
involves constructing equations from the given
information to calculate Ann and her son’s present age.
Sentences (components) A, C, and D are key components
for this problem (see Figure 2). To investigate whether
restructuring was involved in solving this algebra
problem, 2x4x2x3 (session x component x answer
condition x solution type) ANOVA was conducted.
This analysis once again revealed a significant session x
component x solution type interaction F (6, 353) = 3.35, p
< .05, n2 = .05. However, follow up analyses revealed no
significant differences between session 1 and session 2
ratings for any of the components in any of the groups
(see Table 2). This interaction was most likely caused by
the trend toward hindsight bias on component C by those
in the correct solution/not given answer condition, and by
a trend towards a decrease in importance ratings on
component D in the incorrect/ shown answer group.
However, interaction was small in effect size. These
unsystematic trends are weak evidence for restructuring.
Therefore, once again, we find no clear evidence
restructuring in the solution of algebra problems.
Cups Insight Problem In order to solve this problem,
one must pick up the glass in position B and pour the
liquid into the cup in position E. Therefore, B and E are
the key components of this problem. The insightful

process theories would predict that the initial
representation should be biased against viewing cup E as
being key in finding the correct solution. This leads to the
prediction that importance levels should increase for the
two key components for those who correctly solve, while
those who do not correctly solve should not show
hindsight bias on only the two key components.
To investigate whether restructuring was involved in
solving this problem, a 2x6x2x3 (session x component x
answer condition x solution type) ANOVA was
conducted. This analysis revealed a significant session x
component interaction, F (5, 545) = 4.7, p < .05, n2 = .02.
Follow-up analysis revealed significant increases in
importance ratings for both key components B (t (119) =
3.85, p < .05, n2 = .11) and E (t (119) = 2.10, p < .05, n2 =
.03) across all participants. Even though a survey of the
means (see Table 4) gives the impression that the groups
that solved the problem correct are driving this effect, a
significant interaction involving solution type was not
detected. This result tends to follow the predicted pattern
of hindsight bias that would be expected with regards to
restructuring accounts of insightful problem solving, and
stands in contrast to the algebra results that showed no
evidence of restructuring.
Triangle Insight Problem To solve this problem, one
must move the corner three circles around one position in
order to make the triangle point down. The insightful
process theories would predict that the initial
representation should be biased towards viewing the array
as a triangle and therefore solvers will inappropriately
view the point of the triangle, or the top three circles, as
more important. In order to solve, individuals will need
to restructure their representation of the middle circles of
the triangle as invariant whether the triangle points up or
down. Therefore, the corner circles A, G, and J, are the
key components for solving the problem (see Figure 3).
To investigate whether restructuring was involved in
solving this insight problem, a 2x10x2x3 (session x
component x answer condition x solution type) ANOVA
was conducted. This analysis revealed a significant
session x component interaction, F (9, 1098) = 4.05, p <
.05, n2 = .03; a significant session x component x answer
condition interaction, F (18, 1098) = 2.04, p < .05, n2 =
.01, and a significant session x component x solution type
interaction, F (18, 1098) = 1.91, p < .05, n2 = .03.
Follow-up analysis found significant increases in
importance ratings, or strong positive trends, on each of
the key components for those who successfully solved the
problem regardless of whether they were shown the
answer (see Table 5). This evidence supports the idea that
those individuals who solved correctly had a different
(more appropriate) problem representation on their second
encounter with the problem.
Other significant increases were found on components
D and E (both unimportant for finding correct solution)
for those who came to no solution and did not receive the
answer. In the groups that received the answers but did
not find the correct solution, increases in importance
ratings were detected on the entire bottom row of circles

(G through J). These findings suggest that being shown
the solution to an insight problem can lead to a shift in
representation. However this shift is not exclusive to the
key problem solving components.

and algebra problems. Currently we are in the process of
conducting more detailed studies using the hindsight bias
paradigm on a wider range of problems, as well as using
this method to investigate the role of impasse in the
insightful problem solving process.

Discussion
These results suggest that hindsight bias can be used as an
independent measure of the restructuring involved in
solving different problems. These results demonstrate
some of the characteristics predicted by insightful
problem solving theories that involve mechanism of
sudden restructuring of one’s problem representation in
order to come to solution (Duncker, 1945, Davidson &
Sternberg, 1984, Ohlsson, 1992). Although all of the
predicted interactions on insight problem component
ratings were not found to be significant, there was
evidence of an increase in importance ratings on key
components in insight problems and not on algebra
problems. Also there was evidence that these increases in
importance ratings occurred in groups that had
successfully solved the insight problem, regardless of
whether they were shown the correct solution. The results
on the insight problems contrast with those for the algebra
problems, which showed little evidence of any increases
on importance ratings on the key components. In
examining the results it is clear that individuals initially
were able to recognize which components of the algebra
problems were key in solving the problem. However,
even though all individuals were able to correctly report
the importance of the key components, many still failed to
correctly solve the algebra problems. This suggests that
the locus of difficulty for the algebra problems did not lie
in the representation.
While all the predicted interactions on the insight
components were not found, it is helpful to keep in mind
that this was a very stringent test for hindsight bias. The
participants in this study were not asked to re-rate the
questions during the second session of the experiment.
They were asked to “reproduce” or remember their
original ratings. It has been estimated that 2/3 of
participants are actually able to remember their original
rating in this type of within-subjects design (Fischoff &
Beyth, 1975). Even though steps were taken to prevent
this (ex. rating were done on continuums instead of Likert
scales, one full week between sessions) this surely may
have affected the final outcome. Also, all theories of
insightful problem solving agree that restructuring is far
more likely when subjects are naïve to the problems. In
this design there was no way to separate out those who
had experience with the problems and were able to solve
through some other method than restructuring (i.e.
memory search). On the same note, it may be possible
that individuals did not have the expertise in algebra to
solve the problems in a totally incremental fashion. In this
design there was also no way to separate out those who
experienced partial insights while solving the algebra
problems (see Ohlsson, 1992). These factors may have
also confounded the hindsight bias results. Despite all of
these issues, there was clear evidence for differential
amounts and patterns of hindsight bias between insight
