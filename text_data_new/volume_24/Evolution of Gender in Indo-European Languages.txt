Abstract
In a recent paper, Lera Boroditsky and Lauren A.
Schmidt (2000) examined the degree to which the
linguistic category of grammatical gender of nouns
influences people’s perception of the cognitive category
of biological gender, or sex. Their conclusion was that
English speakers’ intuitions about the gender of certain
nouns (animals) correlate with the gender assigned to
those nouns in languages such as German and Spanish.
More important, they found that people’s ideas about the
putative biological gender (sex) of objects are strongly
influenced by the grammatical gender of those objects in
their native language. In this study I sought to reproduce
Boroditsky and Schmidt’s results in order to show that
the interpretation they supplied is unwarranted, and that
the authors conflate the concepts of biological gender
(sex) and “formal gender”, which is employed by most
Indo-European languages (as opposed to “natural
gender”, in English). I compare the intuitions of 20
American monolinguals with the statistics of formal
gender as it appears in 14 Indo-European languages.
Moreover, I discuss the possible origin and evolution of
gender in such languages, and suggest an explanation for
the relation between grammatical and biological gender.

Introduction
The idea that our native language may shape our
thought, in part or in whole, is usually associated with
the work of Whorf and Sapir, in what is known as “the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis” (Whorf, 1956). This is an
intriguing hypothesis because it implies that different
cultures — speaking different languages — may
perceive the world in different ways. For example,
whereas one culture may differentiate objects on the
basis of shape, another culture may differentiate them
on the basis of material (Imai and Gentner, 1997), and
this may be reflected in the corresponding languages.
To what extent, then, does language (and culture) force
a person’s cognition to perceive the world in one way
rather than another?
A possible manifestation of this idea was examined
by Boroditsky and Schmidt (henceforth B&S), in
studying the way grammatical and biological gender
interfere with each other in the minds of native speakers
of languages such as Spanish and German. B&S
support the idea that a speaker whose language assigns
the genders masculine and feminine to nouns —

whether they refer to people, animals, things, or ideas
— is bound to subliminally think of an object as having
a corresponding biological gender, male or female. (To
avoid circumlocutions, I use the word “sex” to refer to
biological gender, reserving “gender” for the
grammatical category.)
B&S’s proposal rests on the assumption that there is
an inherent equating of the concepts of gender and sex
in such a speaker’s mind. So, for example, a young
learner of an Indo-European language employing
“formal gender” could associate a specific category of
nouns discernible only through the behavior of
neighboring words (say, the feminine nouns) with a
perceptual property of entities of the world (say, the
femaleness of individuals), even before encountering
the words for “feminine” and “masculine”. Although
the latter point to a certain relation between gender and
sex (which undoubtedly exists), we will see that such an
assumption is untenable. First, however, we should
briefly review the category of gender as it appears in
various languages, in order to understand what it is, and
what relation we may expect between the concepts of
gender and sex.
Although many people are familiar with gender as it
appears in Indo-European languages, the notion of
gender as understood by linguists is much more
general. As a “definition”, I will follow Charles F.
Hockett’s description: “Genders are classes of nouns
reflected in the behavior of associated words” (Hockett,
1958:231). A characterization like this is general
enough to encompass all noun categories that linguists
call “genders”, whether they are labeled “masculine”,
“feminine”, “neuter”, “common”, or even “class IV”.
A language may have two or more classes of nouns
that qualify as genders, or it may have none, in which
case we say that the language lacks a gender system.
Such is the case with several of the major families of
Asian languages (e.g., Mandarin Chinese). Tamil, a
member of the Dravidian family in south India, divides
nouns into “rational” (i.e., people, gods) and “nonrational” (animals, and everything else), and further
subdivides rational gender into “masculine” and
“feminine” (Corbett, 1991:8–10). Thus, Tamil employs
a “natural gender system”, which means that given the
semantics of a noun we can predict its gender, and viceversa. English, a Germanic language, has a natural

gender system like Tamil, reflected only in personal,
possessive, and reflexive pronouns. There are a few
exceptions to semantic association: “she” may be used
for a ship or country, “he”/“she” for an animal (of
unknown sex), and “it” for downgrading humans
(Mathiot and Roberts, 1979). Other languages show a
less well-defined assignment based on semantics:
Zande, a language spoken mainly in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, assigns nouns generally to four
genders: masculine, feminine, animal, and neuter
(Corbett, 1991:14). There are, however, about 80
exceptions, including such concepts as heavenly and
metal objects, and edible plants, which are placed in the
animal gender. Dyirbal, an Australian language, also
has four genders, denoted by “class I, II, III, and IV”. It
has been shown (Dixon, 1972:308–12) that male
humans and non-human animates belong to class I;
female humans, water, fire, and fighting to class II;
non-flesh food to class III; and everything else to class
IV. Thus, the rules are semantic but non-obvious.
However, children learning the language do not appear
to learn the gender of nouns individually.
Turning now to typical Indo-European languages, we
see an even smaller dependence on semantics. Nouns
denoting people — assigned to masculine or feminine
gender according to sex — are a minority. The
“exceptions” (non-sexed objects assigned to either of
those two genders) are the majority, thus making the
semantic association a rather useless predictor for the
gender of a noun. This fact, as we shall see, is very
important for a correct assessment of B&S’s work.

B&S’s Experiment 1
In their first experiment, B&S investigated whether “the
grammatical genders of nouns do in part reflect the
properties of their referents” (Boroditsky and Schmidt,
2000:2). If true, they predicted “a correspondence in the
assignment of genders across languages, and also a
correspondence between Spanish and German genders
and English speakers’ naive intuitions”. Although their
testing of the prediction of correspondence across
languages was rather inadequate (regarding the number
of languages; I improve this test in the present study),
they did a more thorough test of the naïve intuitions of
15 English speakers, none of whom were familiar with
either Spanish or German (though we do not know if
they were monolinguals). The subjects were asked to
exclusively classify each of 50 animal names and 85
names of artifacts as either masculine or feminine (B&S
do not give a list of those words).
Their comparison of gender agreement between
Spanish and German yielded a correlation coefficient of
r = 0.21, p < 0.05. This, they termed an “appreciable
agreement”. Although I would think a value of r = 0.21
(hence, r2 = 0.04) indicates a rather appreciable
disagreement, B&S pointed out that the two languages

“agreed more on the genders of animals (r=.39, p<.01),
[than] on the genders of artifacts (r=.10, p<.35)”.
To test B&S’s hypothesis on the agreement of gender
across languages, I examined 84 common nouns in 14
Indo-European languages. The nouns were chosen so
that they represented more-or-less common referents:
20 artifacts, 22 natural objects, 20 abstract ideas, and 22
animals. The 14 languages were chosen so that a fairly
representative set of the Indo-European family tree was
obtained (three Germanic: Dutch, German, Icelandic;
four Romance: French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese;
three Slavic: Polish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian; one
Celtic: Irish; and also Albanian, Greek, and Kurdish.)
Native speakers verified my choices of nouns
(originally collected from dictionaries) for all languages
but Albanian, Dutch, and Icelandic. The full assignment
of genders is given in Appendix A.
The results of my study show that, predictably, the
closer languages are in the family tree, the more they
agree on gender. Languages as close linguistically as
Portuguese and Spanish show a coefficient of
determination1 r2 = 0.75. However, the coefficient
between Spanish and German is r2 = 0.09, p < 0.01 (so,
r = 0.30; compare with B&S’s r = 0.21), and the one
between Spanish and Russian is r2 = 0.03, exhibiting a
complete uncorrelatedness (see Table 1). Overall,
languages that belong to different subfamilies (e.g., a
pair formed by a Romance and a Germanic language)
show appreciable disagreement. For languages in the
same subfamily, the part on which they agree — as
given by the coefficient r2 — is explicable not by
reference to any inherent common intuition of people
on the sex of things like a book and a tree, but by
reference to the fact that Indo-European languages
evolved from a common ancestor language, which
employed gender, probably one with a strong semantic
basis. As languages diverged, so did gender
assignments, precisely because there is no objective and
universal basis on which to decide the gender/sex of
“flower”, or the idea of “war”, or even the words for
“cat” and “butterfly”. (See Appendix A: each of these
words is nearly evenly assigned — close to 50% —
between the masculine and feminine genders.) Table 1
shows the coefficients of determination (r2) between the
14 languages.
B&S’s second prediction is that English native
speakers’ naïve intuitions about the gender of nouns
1

Since I observed no negative correlation, I prefer to use r2,
the coefficient of determination, rather than r, the correlation
coefficient, because the former has a natural interpretation,
which the latter lacks: r2 shows the proportion of variation in
one population that is explained by the variation in the other
population. To be precise, I should employ the non-parametric
rs2: Spearman rank coefficient of determination, since the
populations are highly non-normal. However, in our case
differences between r2 and rs2 appear only in the second
decimal place, so I will keep referring to r2 in order to
facilitate the comparison with B&S’s results.

should show a correspondence with the assignment of
gender in other Indo-European languages. To test this
prediction I asked 20 monolingual native American
English speakers (10 males and 10 females) to assign a
gender, either masculine or feminine, to each of the 84
nouns listed in Appendix A. Subjects showed a
remarkable consistency among themselves (average
standard deviation s = 0.18), especially for words that
have a natural association with maleness and potency
(e.g., hammer, boulder, thunder, attack, war, lion), or
with femaleness and beauty (e.g., flower, happiness,
love, butterfly). The average assignments of genders by
English monolinguals form a 15th population, which
was compared against each of the 14 studied languages
to determine the degree of correlation. The last row in
Table 1 shows the values of r2 for each case. We see
that the opinion of native English speakers on gender
shows a very weak correlation with each of the 14
languages, except possibly Kurdish (which can be
attributed to statistical error). No negative correlation
was observed. The average of all r2 is <r2> = 0.03. The
p-values (indicating linear relationships) are statistically
insignificant (p > 0.05) for all languages but Dutch,
German, and Kurdish. However, it should be noted that
the p-values are bound to converge to zero given a large
enough sample size. What is important is not whether a
linear relationship exists, suggested by the p-values, but
the magnitude of correlation, given by r2.
To explain why the correlation between English
speakers’ intuitions and gender assignment in the 14
studied languages is so weak, we must understand the
cognitive processes of gender acquisition in such
languages. Young learners of Indo-European languages
with formal gender might notice the close correlation
between gender and sex when the noun being referred
to is a person (or even a pet of a known sex). However,
learners could not miss noticing the clear unrelatedness
of gender and sex when the object being referred to is

not an animal, and thus lacks sex. In the young learner’s
world, the nouns for which gender and sex correlate
nicely are a small minority compared to those for which
the two notions cannot be correlated (because sex is not
one of the perceived properties of the object referred to
by the noun). The situation is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Gender vs. sex in “formal gender” languages
The sizes of the areas in Figure 1 are schematic, but
relevant. Assuming the learner’s cognitive mechanisms
are tuned toward noticing the statistics and learning the
regularities of this world, we conclude that the learner
of such a language should not find the linguistic
category of gender a particularly good predictor of the
cognitive percept of sex. We should note that, at an
early (pre-school) age, the learner is oblivious to the
fact that the name of an observed category of nouns is
“masculine”, a word closely associated with maleness,
while another category is called “feminine”; the learner
simply notices the categories. Later, during formal
education, the suspected (weak) relation between the
notions of gender and sex may be reinforced, but it
happens at a time when the learner has already acquired
the linguistic category of formal gender, and has
already noted that, as Figure 1 suggests, gender is not a
good predictor of sex, and the two notions are only
loosely related.
On the contrary, learners of languages that employ
“natural gender”, such as English, notice the close
correlation between gender and sex. For such
languages, the situation is depicted in Figure 2.

sex-unrelated

Figure 2: Gender vs. sex in “natural gender” languages

In this case, the intersection of masculine, feminine,
and neuter nouns having the “correct” correlation with
the percepts “male”, “female”, and “other” is large. The
close correlation between gender and sex thus turns the
percept of sex into a good predictor of the grammatical
category of gender, and vice-versa. This fact may lead
speakers of languages employing natural gender into
conflating the two ideas, and possibly, as the B&S
paper implicitly suggests, thinking that native speakers
of languages with formal gender may perform a similar
conflation. We should note in passing that one of the
meanings of the word “gender” in English is “the state
of being male, female, or neuter; sex” (Oxford English
Dictionary, 1993). Thus, in English, the question “what
is your gender?” is a meaningful one to ask a person. In
Greek on the other hand, a typical Indo-European
language employing formal gender, the same question
(“pio eeneh to genos sou?”) is absurd, because it
implies the questioned entity is a noun —akin to asking
in English: “what is your declension?”

B&S’s Experiment 2
In their second experiment, B&S attempted to test
whether “people’s ideas about the genders of objects
are strongly influenced by the grammatical genders
assigned to these objects in their native language”
(Boroditsky and Schmidt, 2000: Abstract). B&S based
their hypothesis on an earlier study (Konishi, 1993)
where German and Spanish speakers judged nouns that
were masculine in their languages to be higher in
potency than feminine ones, and the tested nouns
belonged to opposite genders in the two languages.
Subjects assigned subjectively a potency value for each
noun, on a 7-point scale. B&S presented 24 pairs
consisting of a noun (e.g., “spoon”) and a proper name
(e.g., “Erica”) to 16 German and 25 Spanish native
speakers during a learning phase. All nouns were given
in English. The subjects’ memory of the sex of the
proper name that had been associated with a noun was
examined during the testing phase. As expected,
subjects were better able to remember the correct sex
(82% correct) when the sex (e.g., “female”) matched
with the gender (e.g., “feminine”), than when this was
not the case (74% correct). Since the nouns were
chosen to have opposite genders in the two languages,
subjects showed opposite memory biases. B&S
concluded that “people’s ideas about the genders of
objects are strongly influenced by the grammatical
genders assigned to those objects in their native
language.”
As with experiment 1, what is important is not the
observation that there is an interference in memory
retention between gender and sex, but the explanation
for this phenomenon. B&S tacitly assume people make
a direct connection between the concepts “masculine”
and “male”, and between “feminine” and “female”.

This direct connection may be “traversed” in the
Spanish speaker’s mind when presented with the word
“moon” (in Spanish: “ luna”, of feminine gender), so
that they match the “femaleness” of the moon with the
femaleness implied by a name like “Karla”. A German
speaker performing the same task (being presented with
“moon” – “Karla”) would experience inhibition
between moon’s “maleness” (in German: “ Mond”,
masculine), and Karla’s femaleness, resulting in slightly
worse memory performance.
Plausible as this explanation might appear, it makes
more sense in the mind of a native speaker of a natural
gender language (such as English), where “male” –
“masculine” and “female” – “feminine” nearly coincide
conceptually. For a native speaker of a formal gender
language this explanation seems to be simplistically
projecting the natural-gender speaker’s view of the
world onto everyone else. An alternative explanation is
that the interference is caused by a much more indirect
relation between noun and proper name than what B&S
hypothesize. For example, the word “moon” in a
Spanish speaker’s mind evokes involuntarily, instantly,
and subliminally, the Spanish word “luna”. This word is
of feminine gender, and is related to the feminine
ending “-a”, the pronoun “ ella”, and so on. The proper
name “Karla” is also of feminine gender in the Spanish
speaker’s mind (75% of all female names tested by
B&S ended in “-a”, the marker of Spanish morphology
for feminine nouns), and thus instantly and subliminally
related to the same grammatical items (“ella”,
“feminine”, etc). We should note that I make no
reference to “moon’s sex” in this conceptual plan. In
other words, there is a lot of overlap in linguistic
connections between “moon”–“luna” and “Karla” in the
Spanish speaker’s mind. 2 No experimental setting can
sever these linguistic connections, and allow us to test
exclusively the connections “feminine” – “female” and
“masculine” – “male”. I do not claim that such direct
connections do not exist in the mind of a formal gender
language’s speaker. Such connections do exist. They
may be learned in school, where the words for
“masculine” and “feminine” are used as labels for
categories of nouns the native speaker has already
acquired at a very early stage; or they may be based on
the small number of sex-related nouns. What I do claim
is that experiments such as the one described by B&S
(and Konishi) do not necessarily detect the direct
influence of a supposed “sex of nouns” on cognition in
speakers of languages with formal gender, but instead
the very intricate and indirect connections between
gender and sex in such languages, which are of both a
perceptual as well as a linguistic nature.
2

This argument is weaker for German speakers, but then we
are not given the difference in performance between German
and Spanish subjects in B&S’s second experiment.

Evolution of Gender
What could the origin of grammatical gender be? B&S
hint at possible common intuitions of people across
languages, and attempt to quantify this assumption by
examining the intuitions of speakers of English.
I performed a similar comparison of such intuitions
against Indo-European languages, and found that such
intuitions do not show any particular correlation with
the studied languages (Table 1). Moreover, it would be
meaningful to talk about such a correlation if languages
agreed among themselves. Otherwise, if we find a
correlation between the intuitions of monolingual
speakers of English and, say, Kurdish, we do not have
any reason to assume there is anything other than
chance involved. Looking back at the data in Table 1,
we see that the only agreement that can be observed
among languages is between members of the same
subfamily (e.g., Portuguese–Spanish, etc.). The more
phylogenetically distant the languages, the lower their
correlation is (allowing for statistical errors). This hints
at a possible answer to the gender-origin question.
That all Indo-European languages evolved from a
common ancestor is indisputable. It is plausible to
assume that this ancestor language employed a gender
system, possibly one with a semantic basis. But what
could have caused its modern descendants to assign
genders such as masculine and feminine to inanimate
objects? And how can a “pure” system (I mentioned
Tamil as an example in the introduction) evolve into the
modern chaos and disagreement?
The answer some authors have given to these
questions is that the origin of gender is purely formal:
some suffixes of sex-differentiable nouns acted as
attractors, and created the genders in a purely formal,
non-semantic way (Brugmann, 1899). This leaves open
the question of what caused sex-differentiable nouns,
rather than any other category, to become attractors.
Another possible answer is that in some languages the
initially semantic neuter gender was lost, and the void
was filled by masculine and feminine genders being
assigned to previously neuter nouns. Such a process can
be observed today in Russian, where neuter nouns are
only 13% of the total, and loanwords entering the
language go primarily to the masculine gender, but also
to the feminine (Corbett, 1991:317). This hypothesis
does not take into account languages that retain the
neuter gender, and still assign masculine and feminine
genders to inanimate objects (German, Greek, etc.).
An alternative hypothesis is that masculine and
feminine assignments to inanimate objects existed even
in the original Indo-European ancestor. Although such
assignments seem nonsensical today, they might have
“made sense” in the remote past, at least among the few
speakers of the ancestor language, based on animistic
conceptions of the world. It could have appeared
natural to a particular culture that, for example, a stone
is of female sex. However, as the original language

evolved, ideas about the stone’s sex changed, too. Since
there is no objective way to agree on something like the
sex of a stone, the “opinions” among descendant
languages evolved differently. What we observe today
appears as a purely formal and arbitrary assignment,
since the original “reasons” have been lost. One
prediction of this hypothesis is that gender evolution in
such languages should be traceable through a weak
agreement
between
phylogenetically
proximal
languages. I believe the present work supports this
implication, although further investigation of the
hypothesis is clearly needed.

The 84 words in four categories are listed below. For
the abbreviations used for the 14 languages see Table 1
(in text). The codes of gender values are as follows: -1
for masculine, 0 for neuter, 1 for feminine. Any
intermediate values reflect the fact that more than one
assignment was possible for a noun (e.g., “sea” in
German and Spanish), or more than one noun of
differing gender corresponded to the same concept.
