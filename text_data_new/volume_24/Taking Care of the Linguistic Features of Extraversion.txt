Abstract
We study how Extraversion or Introversion influences people’s language production. A corpus of
e-mail texts was gathered from individuals categorised via Eysenck’s EPQ-R personality test. One
experiment analysed the corpus using existing content analysis tools, and found relatively weak effects of Extraversion. A second experiment used
more sensitive bigram-based techniques from statistical natural language processing to replicate earlier
findings, and uncover novel patterns of behaviour.

Introduction
Casual acquaintance with Extraverts1 and Introverts
suggests that the former talk a lot more than the
latter. But apart from this intuitive diﬀerence, how
does this personality dimension influence an individual’s language production? Before addressing this
question, we need to clarify what we mean by Extraversion, and its relevance to cognitive science.
A typical Extravert tends to be sociable, needs
people to talk to, craves excitement, takes chances, is
easy-going, and optimistic. By contrast, a typical Introvert is quiet, retiring, reserved, plans ahead, and
dislikes excitement (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1991).
The personality trait of Extraversion—and the
complementary Introversion—is one of the few which
researchers generally agree provides ‘consistent and
valid information’ (Jonassen and Grabowski, 1993).
Beyond it, there is greater controversy.
For instance, Eysenck’s EPQ-R personality test
reflects a personality model which incorporates just
two further dimensions: Neuroticism, which is
mainly characterised by susceptibility to anxiety;
and Psychoticism, which is more complicated, but
generally related to aggression and individuality. By
contrast, the NEO-PI-R model incorporates five factors (Costa and McCrae, 1992). As well as Extraversion and Neuroticism, there are Conscientiousness,
Agreeableness and Openness. It is generally agreed
that these relate to Psychoticism, but exactly how is
1

The spelling of Extravert follows Eysenck, because
this paper employs his EPQ-R as the measure of personality, but this does not represent a commitment to a
specifically Eysenckian theory of personality.

still the subject of debate (cf. Matthews and Deary,
1998).
Extraversion, and its linguistic consequences—if
there are any—is relevant to cognitive research for
at least two reasons. First, there is considerable
evidence that this personality dimension is related
to preferred learning styles and educational achievement, via speed of exam completion, memory retrieval and recall tasks, creativity, mathematical
ability, self monitoring and communication ability
(Jonassen and Grabowski, 1993). Secondly, there is
evidence that computer users attribute personality
to interfaces, and respond to it in robust ways (eg.
Nass, Moon, Fogg, and Reeves, 1995; Isbister and
Nass, 2000). Even in a text-only environment, Extraverts apparently prefer interfaces presenting information using language associated with Extravert
traits; Introverts prefer Introverted interfaces. An
interface with a matching personality is judged more
positively, and rated as more attractive, credible and
informative (Nass et al., 1995).
So the personality dimension has some validity,
and appears relevant to the diagnosis and projection of personality in human-computer communication, and in computer-based learning. But how does
Extraversion influence an individual’s language production? In addressing this question, we first outline
some hypotheses from the literature, before describing our collection of a controlled corpus of language,
and our analysis of it. We then report the results—
some unsurprising, others unexpected—and discuss
some of their implications.

Previous hypotheses
Work on textual personality within the “Computers
Are Social Actors” paradigm has taken the expressive hallmarks of Extraversion or dominance (one
facet of the dimension) to be confidence, as shown
by an avoidance of hedge-expressions such as perhaps and maybe (Nass et al., 1995), and is related
to the empirical work of Bradac and Mulac (1984)
on perceptions of powerful and powerless speech.
From an intuitive perspective, Extraverts are described as individuals who think out loud, do most
of the talking, are less self-focussed, and tend to
skip from topic to topic. Conversely, Introverts mo-

nopolise the conversation on topics important to
them, are more self-focussed and prefer to concentrate on discussing one topic in depth (cf. Carment,
Miles, and Cervin, 1965). With reference primarily
to speech, Furnham (1990) has proposed that Extravert language is less formal, has a more restricted
code, uses more verbs, adverbs and pronouns (rather
than nouns, adjectives, and prepositions), and uses
vocabulary loosely (see also Dewaele and Furnham,
1999, for a review of speech and writing studies).
Text analysis approaches have found that transcribed texts rated as belonging to the warm facet
of Extraversion used fewer negative emotion words
and unique words, and more present tense verbs,
with dominant texts using fewer unique words, positive emotion words and self referents (Berry, Pennebaker, Mueller, and Hiller, 1997). Finally, study of
the texts written by Extraverts has found that they
used fewer negations, tentative words, negative emotion words, causation words, inclusive words, and exclusive words, while using more social and positive
emotion words (Pennebaker and King, 1999).

Data Collection
The approach to data collection follows Pennebaker
and King (1999). Written texts were collected
from 105 University students or recent graduates
(37 males, 68 females; mean age = 24.3 years; SD
= 4.6; all native English speakers). An introductory e-mail explained the experiment, and pointed
subjects to the relevant web-page. After the completion of an online demographic questionnaire and
a version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire
(Revised short form; Eysenck, Eysenck, and Barrett, 1985) (mean score for E = 7.91, SD = 3.25;
normative score = 7.42 (male), 7.60 (female)), subjects were asked to compose two e-mails to a good
friend whom they hadn’t seen for quite some time,
the style of which is considered to be close to oral
communication (Bälter, 1998). One message concerned their activities in the past week; the other discussed their plans for the next week. Subjects were
advised to spend around ten minutes per message,
composed online and submitted using an HTML
form. It was highlighted that responses would be
treated in confidence and that subjects could remain anonymous. No payment was made for participation, and integrity of responses was monitored
by reading through the transcripts. One additional
submission was rejected as not being serious; the resulting corpus contained 210 texts and 65,000 words.

Experiment 1: Dictionary techniques
LIWC and MRC Methods
LIWC Each respondent’s texts were individually
processed using the LIWC text analysis program
(Pennebaker and Francis, 1999). Items were selected

for principle components analysis using the same criteria as Pennebaker and King (1999), namely reliability, topic independence, independence from other
variables, and a mean minimum usage of 1%. The
validity of the current data was shown using varimax rotation to derive four factors which essentially
replicate their prior findings. There was minor variation in some factor loadings, which we attribute to
diﬀerences in the writing tasks. See Gill and Oberlander (prep) for a fuller discussion.
By correlating their resultant LIWC factors with
personality dimensions, Pennebaker and King’s results suggest broad style preferences for Extraverts.
But this does not identify the relative importance of
their categories for identifying text as Extravert.
Thus, to identify which LIWC variables best help
identify an author’s personality, stepwise linear multiple regression was performed. The variables entered were those which showed at least a small correlation with the personality type—with a significance
of p < .1—and which satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the previous principle components analysis.
However, since requiring variables to have a mean
usage of 1% per essay for inclusion in the analysis did not leave any LIWC variables in the regression equation for Extraversion, this criterion was ignored for the results presented below. (Interestingly,
by contrast, even with the application of this criterion, Psychoticism and Neuroticism both had several
strongly significant LIWC predictor variables.)
MRC In addition to the LIWC-based tests, multiple regression analysis was also performed on psycholinguistic properties of the texts, derived from the
MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart, 1981).
Texts were first tagged for Parts of Speech,2 and
each word-POS pair was then looked up in the
database. If the word and POS tag matched a pair
in the database, psycholinguistic data was returned
for that word. When all the words in the text had
been processed, mean scores were calculated for categories such as verbal frequency, written frequency,
concreteness, age of acquisition, along with additional global information, such as the percentage of
a text’s words which were captured by the database.
As with the LIWC regression, variables showing a
correlation with the personality type with a significance of p < .1 were entered in to the equation.

it may be that for Psychoticism and Neuroticism
the choice of word, or some property of the word
is informative—but for Extraverts, it may be that
word order or collocations are more relevant.

Results
The multiple regression analysis of the LIWC variables (Table 1) shows that a greater overall word
count for a text (β = .20), and the occurrence
of fewer references to numbers within that text
(β = −.21), indicate Extraversion (p < .05). So,
Extraverts do appear to type more than Introverts,
mirroring earlier results on speech (Carment et al.,
1965), with the avoidance of numbers embodying
a ‘looser’, less precise use of language (Furnham,
1990). However, the variance accounted for by these
variables is relatively low at 8%. In comparable analyses, both Psychoticism and Neuroticism regression
equations explain variance greater than 10%.
Similarly, with the MRC Psycholinguistic analysis
(Table 2), only the novel finding of a general lowering of a text’s concreteness of vocabulary (β = −.21,
p < .05) was seen to explain 5% of variance in Extraversion. Again, equations for Psychoticism and
Neuroticism explained more than 10% of variance.

Discussion
In both of the dictionary-based analyses of the
texts, rather few features appeared to distinguish
Extravert/Introvert texts, especially when compared
to the numerous LIWC and MRC features which associated with Psychoticism and Neuroticism traits.
How could this be? At least two explanations
are possible. First, the LIWC dictionary is a subjectively constructed analysis tool. It is based on
judgements by health psychologists of texts written
by distressed individuals for therapeutic purposes
(Pennebaker and Francis, 1999). For its original
purposes, this is a strength; but it also imposes a
top down limitation on LIWC’s functioning. Given
this therapeutic origin, it is tempting to suggest that
the linguistic features associated with the personality traits of Psychoticism and Neuroticism were more
important or relevant to the distressed individuals
producing the texts—and that is why these features
are better represented in LIWC’s dictionary.
The MRC database is also fitted to its specific
purposes—for example, matching psycholinguistic
stimuli—but this again imposes constraints which
might prove artificial when it is applied to a diﬀerent area of investigation.
Secondly, both dictionaries necessarily operate using strings corresponding to individual words, subsequently classifying them in a predefined way. Neither takes into account the context of a word. Thus

Therefore, we recruit bottom up statistical text analysis techniques from corpus linguistics. Specifically,
bigram analysis calculates the probability of pairs
of adjacent terms, or bigrams, occurring together in
that order in a given text. To determine the significance of a bigram’s occurrence, a statistic—log
likelihood—is calculated, taking into account all the
other instances of each element in the bigram pair,
and the other words with which they appear.
Since bigrams can be used to calculate the probabilistic space in which language occurs, they have
been put to a variety of uses (Collins, 1996; Pedersen, 2001). However, this study uses them simply
as an advancement on the classified unigram (that
is, single-word) analysis in Experiment 1. Because
bigrams contain information about the interconnection and dependencies of words, this second analysis
retains some of the contextual information of language use. Equally importantly, since bigrams are
not classified subjectively, they provide a form of
analysis that is bottom-up, rather than top-down.

Method
The original corpus of texts was divided by degree
of Extraversion by selecting respondents whose E
score was greater or less than 1 s.d. of the mean
(cf. Dewaele and Pavlenko, 2002), with the 21 High
Extravert authors scoring more than 11, and the 17
Low Extravert authors scoring less than 5.
Bigrams were calculated for the resulting Extravert and Introvert subcorpora; the former contained over 12,000 words; the latter around 8,000.Bigram profiles were generated for each corpus and
their co-occurence significance in the current texts
ranked by log-likelihood statistic (−2 log λ),3 since
for smaller corpora this approximates better to χ2
than the X 2 statistic (Dunning, 1993). Rankings
for each group are based on the top 50 bigrams with
frequency of N ≥ 2, and a significance of p < .001.
Relative frequency ratios (Damerau, 1993) were then
calculated for bigrams that were common to both
the subcorpora, and a Spearman Rank correlation
was also performed on these bigrams.

Results
Spearman Rank Correlation
The correlation coeﬃcient score of .53 indicates that
Extravert and Introvert use of the shared bigrams is
significantly correlated at the p < .005 (one-tailed,
N=28) level, and they are therefore not distinct.

However, further analysis showed Extraverts to be
more distinguishable from Ambiverts or Introverts.4

Extraverts versus Introverts
The results of the bigram analysis include: bigrams
which occurred in both the Extravert and Introvert corpora (Table 3); bigrams which were found
uniquely in the Extravert corpus (Table 4); and
those found only in the Introvert corpus (Table 5).
The shared bigrams are ordered by their relative
frequency, with the highest ratios above 1.0 showing the strongest association with Extravert authors,
and the smallest ratios less than 1.0 indicating a
preference on the part of more Introverted authors
(the breakpoint has been indicated by a separating
rule). Features which are unique to each subcorpus
group can be considered the most distinctive of authorial personality. For current purposes, we divide
the features into eight groupings.
Surface Realisation Features These gross features are perhaps the most intuitive in their representation of the Extraverts or Introverts. For example, [<END> hi ], the <END> (end–of–file marker)
4
When comparing the groups High E (≥1s.d.), Mid
E (< ±1s.d.) and Low E (≤ −1s.d.) (all P and N
< ±1s.d.) it was found that Low E and Mid E correlate
very significantly (p < .005; ρ = .67; N = 19), whilst
High E and Mid E do not significantly correlate at the
p < .05 level (ρ = .32; N = 24).

followed by hi, was unique to Extravert texts; and
since the <END> marker separates concatenated
files in the corpus, here we have a tendency towards message-initial hi. By contrast the more formal [<END> hello] was found solely in Introvert
texts. Use of punctuation also diﬀers between the
two groups, with Extraverts preferring multiple exclamation marks [! ! ], and solely using multiple full
stops [. .] as in the elliptical (. . . ), again a feature
of informal style, and ‘looser’ use of language.
Quantification In terms of quantification, Introverts generally tend to show a preference for a
greater use of quantifiers, such as [a lot], [a few ] and
uniquely [all the], [one of ], [lots of ] and [loads of ],
whereas Extraverts show a preference for [a bit] and
uniquely use [couple of ]. Not only does this demonstrate an Extravert tendency to be looser and less
specific, it also apparently reveals exaggeration on
the part of the Introvert.
Social Devices The Extravert use of stylistic expressions such as [catch up] and [take care] indicate
a relaxed and informal style; their omission points
to a more socially restrained Introvert. A surprisingly neat equivalence in expression can be found between the Extravert use of [other than] rather than
[apart from], although it is not immediately clear
what might give rise to this.
Self/Other Reference References to self in the
texts demonstrate diﬀerences between Extraverts
and Introverts: Introverts make extensive use of the
first person singular pronoun ([i don’t], [i went], [i’m
going], [i can], [i’ve got] are all unique to the Introvert text), and also show preference for the following
shared bigrams: [i’ve done], [i think ], [i am], [. i ].

For Extraverts, the only unique first person bigram
is [i’ll be], and they also show greater use of [i was]
and [i will ], although relatively less preferred than
Introvert forms. This underscores the increased Introvert tendency to focus on self, whereas the only
bigram containing a first person plural is unique to
Extraverts ([we went]). The Extravert preference for
the bigram [up with] typically indicates a shared experience (prompting the question with whom? ) and
greater sociability. These results apparently contradict Furnham (1990) on pronouns, but given that
the vast majority of pronouns here are first-person
singular, thus focusing on self, this is unsurprising.
Valence Bigrams containing negations were used
significantly only by Introverts, as in [i don’t] and
[don’t know ] (indeed [i don’t] is the bigram with most
frequent use of i ) , whilst Extraverts used the bigram
[a good ] which is suggestive of positive aﬀect.5 Similarly, the Extravert preference for [looking forward ]
and [forward to] (presumably as in looking forward
to) also suggests a more positive disposition.
Ability Personal views on capability are suggested
by the diﬀerent collocations with infinitival to.6 For
Extraverts, their ability to do something should
they choose is confidently and assertively relayed using want–, need–, and able– (to); which they use
uniquely. Introverts more timidly and tentatively
5
Further investigation shows that good is not directly
negated (as in [not good ]). Compare the Introvert [i can],
which was generally followed by not. Although the eﬀect
of negation was not viewed as important by Pennebaker
in the functioning of LIWC, it certainly has implications
for models of language generation.

This confirms the appropriacy of retaining functors

state that they are [trying to] or possibly—and at
some point in the future—they are [going to].
Modality Similarly, collocations with the verb be
show a distinction in use of modal auxiliaries which
has an eﬀect on the projection of certainty. For
example, Introverts are unique in their use of the
weaker and more tentative should be, whereas Extraverts show a greater use of the stronger predictive
[will be], and are unique in their use of the contracted
form [i’ll be] (i will be) (Coates, 1983).
Message Planning/Expression Looking towards surrogates of grammatical construction, Extraverts and Introverts diﬀer in their use of connectives: Introverts show preference for the coordinating conjunctions [, and ] and [, but], whilst
Extraverts uniquely show use of the subordinating
[, which], usually deployed in an evaluative sense.

Discussion
In summary, our results support earlier findings, and
suggest some new conclusions.
We found that Extraverts produce texts with
more words, which supports the previous findings
for speech (Carment et al., 1965), whilst the reduced
concreteness of Extravert language is a novel finding.
It may be a direct consequence of talking or writing
more, if the pressure to produce words at a high
rate (in order to hold the floor, for instance) diverts
resources away from more detailed lexical planning.
Introverts’ greater preference for numbers and quantification fits with this, and is compatible with findings concerning the use of articles (Pennebaker and
King, 1999), and suggestions of a more imprecise and
‘looser’ Extravert style (Furnham, 1990).
Extraverts’ use of other or social referents, and Introverts’ preference for self referents confirms Berry
et al. (1997)’s previous findings for Extraversion and
its dominant/submissive facets. Another possible
manifestation of the increased Extravert social ability and ease in interaction is expressed by their use
of surface features and social devices. We also note
in passing the tendency of Extraverts to refer to days
of the weekend, where Introverts refer to weekdays.
Our results on valence are consistent with previous
findings on Introverts’ preference for negations and
negative emotion words, and the Extravert tendency
for positive aﬀect words is consistent with results for
warmth. However, they do suggest that care should
be taken over the relation between Extraversion and
dominant facet features (cf. Isbister and Nass, 2000).
Expressions of definite modality and ability appear to be associated with Extraversion, although
they may not be the same forms as those discussed
in the context of powerful/less speech. Adoption of
definite modalities can also be related to avoidance
of tentativity (Pennebaker and King, 1999).
Turning to connectives, we note that our Introvert

preference for [, and ] and [, but] is consistent with
studies using LIWC which found that the dictionary
categories of Inclusion and Exclusion were both inversely correlate with Extraversion. However, [other
than] and [apart from] would both fall into the same
LIWC category, yet appear to distinguish opposite
ends of the personality dimension.

Conclusion
By combining techniques from psycholinguistics and
statistical natural language processing, we have been
able to replicate previous findings on the expression
of Extraversion through language, and uncover some
new linguistic behaviours. Where existing content
analysis tools could not detect reliable diﬀerences,
more sensitive linguistic tools proved their worth.
Further, more technically sophisticated analyses
can be carried out on this data, and we envisage the
use of machine learning techniques to identify distinctive features from the texts, along with bigram
analysis exploiting Parts of Speech tags. Additionally, the role of gender could be investigated.
Our findings could be exploited within the field
of automatic language generation. As they stand,
stochastic techniques would be needed; however, a
cognitively-based personality model would allow a
deeper approach, and that is our eventual goal.
