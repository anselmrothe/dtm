Abstract

may attempt to maximize payoff while others prefer to
minimize risk. We argue that the "big three" decision
anomalies come about as a natural consequence of
aggregating preferences across different agents.

This paper presents an application of voting geometry to
individual decision making. We demonstrate that a number
of decision anomalies can arise as a natural consequence of
the aggregation of preferences of different neural systems. We
present a proof of existence of a set of voting procedures that
can account for the attraction effect, the similarity effect and
the compromise effect, and provide an example of one such
procedure in the form of a modified Borda count. The result is
an original closed form computational model of
multialternative choice.

The Big Three
A very simple laboratory example will be used to represent
human decision-making in real life (c.f. Roe et al., 2001). In
this example, the choice set includes a limited number of
choice options that vary on two attributes. This
representation simplifies the demonstration of the anomalies
and makes it easier to analyze decision-outcomes, but the
findings are applicable to more complex real-life choice
problems as well (Roe et al., 2001). The choice options are
represented in terms of different pairs of shoes that vary on
two attribute dimensions: comfort and style. The ideal shoe
would be closest to the upper right hand corner of the
diagram, where the shoes are most stylish and at the same
time most comfortable. Figure 1 represents the “shoe” choice set, which will be used throughout the entire paper.

Introduction
For nearly 50 years, psychologists have been cataloguing
violations of the standard assumptions of economic theory:
that humans exhibit rational, stable, and ordered
preferences. As the field has come to a consensus that the
rational model is a poor descriptor of human behavior,
researchers have moved from documenting anomalies to
attempting to model them.
To date, the most successful attempt to model decision
anomalies has been Decision Field Theory (DFT),
introduced by Busemeyer and Townsend (1993). Using a
sequential sampling approach, DFT can account for three of
the most puzzling decision anomalies: compromise effects,
attraction effects, and similarity effects. Busemeyer and his
colleagues have proven that there exists no weighting
function for a utility model that can effectively capture all
three of these phenomena (Roe, Busemeyer, Townsend,
2001). While DFT remains the premier computational
approach for multi-attribute choice, recent criticism about
the biological plausibility of the model (Usher &
McClelland, 2004) has led researchers to try and account for
the "big three" decision anomalies using different
techniques.
In this paper we propose a model for multi-attribute
choice derived from the principles of voting geometry. We
assume a number of neural systems within an individual's
brain (i.e. "agents"), which differentially respond to
different attributes of choice. For example, some agents

Figure 1: The choice set
Figure 1 provides a geometric representation of a
hypothetical choice set. Options A, S, and D are in the upper
left hand corner, which means that they are high on the style
attribute but low on comfort. D is completely dominated by
A, while S is similar to A but slightly better in style and

635

slightly worse in comfort. Option C lies exactly between A
and B and is thus a compromise of the two dimensions.
Choice B is high on comfort but low on the style attribute.

Voting Theory
Basic characteristics
Just as different neurons and neural systems in the visual
system can preferentially respond to stimuli of a particular
shape or orientation, we posit that different neurons and
neural systems in the frontal cortex (and other decision
centers; a.k.a. “agents”) might prefer different attributes
among a set of options. Some may attempt to reduce risk,
others might respond to the maximum possible payoff, etc.
The decision outcome for the organism as a whole depends
on the aggregation and evaluation of the preferences of the
individual agents. The collection of this information from
multiple, non-dominant agents can be modeled using voting
geometry (Saari, 1995). There are an infinite number of
different procedures for the aggregation of preferences, but
voting geometry can constrain the space of possible
procedures and explain how individually rational agents can
lead to election outcomes that correspond to decisionmaking anomalies.

Attraction effect: The attraction effect, introduced to the
literature by Huber, Payne and Pluto (1982), occurs when a
choice set of two dissimilar options receives a new
alternative that is completely dominated by one of the two
options. This increases the attractiveness of the dominant
option (Simonson, 1989). Consider, for instance, that a new
brand is introducing a pair of stylish but uncomfortable
shoes on the market. This new choice option D (Figure 1) is
completely dominated by option A, which is both more
stylish and more comfortable than D. In this case the
probability of choosing the dominant option A will increase
after D is added to {A, B} (Roe et al., 2001). Thus, the
introduction of an asymmetrically dominated decoy leads to
the following preference inconsistency: Pr[A|{A,B}] <
Pr[A|{A, D, B}]. This violates the principle of regularity:
that the preference for one option cannot be increased by the
introduction of a new option (Simonson, 1989).
Compromise effect: The compromise effect (Simonson,
1989) occurs when a new option is introduced into a choice
set of two dissimilar options, and falls in between those two
options on all relevant dimensions, thus acting as a
“compromise” option. Typically, the probability of choosing
the compromise option is greater than the probability of
choosing either of the extremes. Consider the introduction
of a shoe that is moderately stylish and comfortable,
represented as C in Figure 1. When all three options A, B,
and C are available, the probability of choosing the
compromise option C is greater than the probability of
choosing either of the two extremes: Pr[A|{A, B}] =
Pr[A|{A, C}] = Pr[B|{B, C}] but Pr[C|{A, B, C}] >
Pr[A|{A, B, C}] and Pr[C|{A, B, C}] > Pr[B|{A, B, C}]
(Roe et a., 2001). Thus, the attractiveness of option C is
enhanced by the presence of A and B.

Procedure Lines
With a choice set of three choices A, B, and C, there are six
possible preference profiles for each agent:
1. A > B > C
2. A > C > B
3. C > A > B
4. C > B > A
5. B > A > C
6. B > C > A
These profiles can be represented geometrically in a
triangle, with each vertex representing a choice option. The
triangle can then be divided into six equally large regions,
which represent the specific profiles.

Similarity effect: The similarity effect, first noted by
Tversky (1972), occurs when a new option is introduced to a
choice set containing two dissimilar options. This new
option is very similar to one of the original options but
neither dominates it, nor is dominated by it. In the case of
the two options A and B in Figure 1, the similarity effect is
produced by the introduction of option S. Shoe S closely
resembles A, but it is better on the style attribute and worse
on the comfort attribute. The decision-maker has to decide
between the stylish yet uncomfortable shoes A and S and
the very comfortable, but unstylish shoe B. The empirical
finding in this case is that the introduction of the shoe S will
take away more buyers from shoe A than from shoe B. This
can lead to the following preference reversal: Pr[A|{A, B}]
> Pr[B|{A, B}] but Pr[B|{A, S, B}] > Pr[A|{A, S, B}] (Roe
et al., 2001). This is an anomaly because the preference
order of options A and B should be independent from the
presence of option S.

Figure 2: Geometrical representation of profiles
Procedure lines are the geometrical representation of
voting outcomes when employing different aggregation
procedures for a set of preference profiles (Saari, 1995). A
positional election with the three candidates A, B, and C is
defined by the voting vector w s = (w1,w 2 ,w 3 ) = (1,s,0) where
0 ! s ! 1 . For a given voting procedure, each choice option
receives a number of points reflecting its ranking. For
example, the plurality vector assigns one point to the top
ranked choice, and! no points to any other option:
W P3 = (1,0,0) . The antiplurality vector assigns points to all

636

but the lowest ranked option: W AP
= (1,1,0) . For voting
procedures which allow fractional points to middle options
(e.g. the Borda Count), voting vectors are normalized (Saari,
1995).
The procedure line –!a geometric representation of the
possible outcomes that can be generated across all voting
procedures for a given preference distribution – is defined
by the line segment connecting the plurality vector and the
antiplurality vector. Intuitively, since the plurality and
antiplurality procedures represent the two extremes
(antiplurality gives full credit to the 2nd place option while
plurality gives none), every other procedure will lie! in
between those two points.
Consider an example in which 1/2 of the voters prefer A >
B > C, 1/3 prefer B > C > A and 1/6 prefer B > A > C. The
plurality vote assigns one point to the top-ranked choice,
which is A in the first profile and B in the second and third
profiles. C does not receive any points. The points are
multiplied with the fraction of votes received by the choice
option, thus yielding the following normalized plurality
vector: w P = ( 1 , 1 + 1 ,0) = ( 1 , 1 ,0) . The antiplurality is
2 3 6

computed in the same way, but by assigning half a point to
all the options except for the bottom ranked one. Thus, the
normalized antiplurality vector in this case is

developed by Saari (1995) to compute the procedure line is
(1 – 2s) (plurality vector) + 2s (antiplurality vector), with s
∈ [0, ½]. This yields a line that can be geometrically
represented inside the triangle represented in Figure 2. The
voting regions crossed by the procedure line reflect all the
possible voting outcomes employing different procedures.
Using the computational approach of procedure lines, it is
now possible to look at the different predictions of the
voting model for the similarity, attraction, and compromise
effects, depending on the voting procedure.

of the triangle

Figure 3: Procedure line for the attraction effect
This indicates that, depending on the voting procedure
employed, the outcome will be either A ~ B > D or A > B >
D. The procedure line (Figure 3) indicates that with the
plurality procedure, A and B will be chosen equally often,
whereas with any other procedure, the outcome of the vote
will be A > B > D, which is the preference structure of the
attraction effect. Thus, the attraction effect arises naturally
from a voting model, nearly independent of the voting
procedure adopted.
Procedure line reflecting the compromise effect: Now
consider the choice set A, B, and C in Figure 1. C lies
exactly between options A and B, reflecting the fact that it is
a compromise between the two. Although C is inferior to
one of the other options in each attribute, according to the
characteristics of the compromise effect, the probability of
choosing C should be higher than the probability of
choosing either A or B.
The presence of C in choice set {A, B, C) will divide the
previous two preference profiles A > B and B > A in the
following way: The agents that preferred A > B care more
about the “style” dimension than the “comfort” dimension.
Since C is greater than B on style, those agents will always
prefer C to B. Agents that strongly prefer style to comfort
will prefer A to C and will now have the profile A > C > B
while others will prefer a balance of style and comfort and
will have the profile C > A > B. The analog occurs for
agents that had preferred B > A: the two possible profiles
are B > C > A and C > B > A. The most conservative
approach to this demonstration is to consider an equal
number of agents that value each dimension. This
distribution leads to the following preference profiles:
1. 1/3 A > C > B
2. 1/3 B > C > A

Procedure line reflecting the attraction effect: Consider
the choice set A, B, and D in Figure 1. A and D are similar
but A is a dominant alternative. Thus, no matter what
dimension an agent cares about, A will always be preferred
to D. The attraction effect refers to the fact that the
introduction of D will increase the probability of choosing
A. For simplicity and clarity, in this demonstration it is
assumed that the two profiles A > B and B > A are equiprobable (although the logic holds even without this
assumption). The introduction of D into choice set {A, B}
will divide the agents who previously had the preference A
> B into two groups: A > B > D and A > D > B. The agents
that had the previous profile B > A only have one possible
profile: B > A > D, and consequently all the agents that
chose B > A will now choose B > A > D. This is because A
dominates D and therefore the profile B > D > A is
impossible because D > A will never be chosen. This leads
to the following preference distribution:

since A and S are very similar.

The antiplurality outcome indicates that C > A ~ B. The line

Figure 4: Procedure line for the compromise effect

Figure 5: Procedure line for the similarity effect

Thus, if the voting model employs plurality vote, then the
outcome will be complete indifference between the three
choice options, and each of them will get selected equally
often. With any other voting procedure, the outcome is C >
A ~ B, which is the preference structure of the compromise
effect. Thus, the compromise effect also arises naturally
from a voting model, nearly independent of voting
procedure adopted.

The plurality vote is better at representing the fact that the
introduction of choice option S into the choice set {A, B}
will take away votes from A, but will not affect votes for B.
The votes for A would thus be split in half by the
introduction of S, and therefore the preference profile B > A
~ S best reflects the similarity effect.

An example voting procedure: Modified Borda
Count

Procedure line reflecting the similarity effect: Finally,
consider the choice set A, S, and B (Figure 1). A and S are
both very similar, but A is better than S on the comfort
attribute and S is better than A on the style attribute.
According to the definition of the similarity effect, the
introduction of S in the choice set {A, B} should decrease
the probability of choosing A relative to the probability of
choosing B. The introduction of S to choice set {A, B} will
divide the agents who previously had the profile A > B into
two groups: A > S > B and S > A > B. The fraction of votes
received by each of these profiles depends on the distance
between A and S. For simplification, it will be assumed that
the votes are split evenly between them. The agents who
previously had the profile B > A will be split into B > A > S
and B > S > A, reflecting the fact that A and S are very
similar to each other. This leads to the following preference
distribution among the agents:
1. 1/4 A > S > B
2. 1/4 S > A > B
3. 1/4 B > A > S
4. 1/4 B > S > A

The exploration of the procedure line not only allows an
intuitive visualization of different voting outcomes across
procedures, but also provides a valuable mathematical tool
to determine what type of preference aggregation can
account for the three decision-making anomalies. For
example, a voting model cannot use a plurality vote, since
the plurality procedure cannot account for the attraction or
compromise effects. A Borda count procedure, which
assigns 2 points to the top option, 1 point to the middle
option and 0 point to the bottom option, seems to be well
suited for the attraction and compromise effects, but it
cannot fully account for the similarity effect. However a
procedure that lies between Borda count and plurality vote
will be able to account for the big three anomalies.
One such procedure would be a modification of the Borda
count, assigning 3 points to the top ranked option (instead of
2 as in Borda count), 1 point to the middle-ranked option,
and 0 points to the lowest ranked option. This procedure
assures that the second-ranked option still receives points,
but that the distribution places more emphasis on the topranked choice option. Looking at the procedure lines, this

638

modified Borda count can account for the three anomalies of
decision-making. The procedure lies between the Borda
count and a plurality vote, because it assigns more weight to
the top-ranked option than Borda count, but not as much
weight to the top option as the plurality vote (which does
not give any points to the second-ranked option at all). Of
course, this procedure is only one example of an infinite
number of aggregation processes lying between Borda count
and plurality. However, this procedure will serve as a
demonstration of how voting models can account for the
three effects.

B, C}] and Pr[B|{A, B, C}] < Pr[C{A, B, C}]. This
violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives
(Tversky & Simonson, 1993) is characteristic of the
compromise effect.
The fractions of agents representing each profile were
chosen in the most conservative way possible. However,
their manipulation will allow us to make predictions about
the behavior of the compromise effect when those fractions
change. In the case when A and B move farther away from
C, the relative fraction of agents representing C should
increase as well. The increase in distance between the
extreme options will thus lead to a stronger compromise
effect. This is the opposite prediction of multialternative
decision field theory (Roe et al., 2001) and suggests an
empirical method for dissociating the models.

How Voting Theory accounts for the Attraction effect:
Consider the choice set A, D, and B (Figure 1) with the
three possible profiles A > D > B, B > A > D, and A > B >
D. These profiles reflect the fact that A always dominates D.
As discussed earlier the preference distribution for this case
is as follows:
Borda
3
1
0

1/4
A
D
B

1/4
A
B
D

1/2

How Voting Theory accounts for the Similarity effect:
Finally, consider the choice set A, B and S (Figure 1),
with S being very similar to A. The possible profiles in this
case are A > S > B, S > A > B, B > A > S and B > S > A.
As discussed earlier, the preference distribution among the
four possible profiles is as follows:

With n agents:
A=2n
B = 7/4 n
D =1/4 n

For n agents, the modified Borda Count procedure yields
2n points for option A (.25*3+.25*3+.5*1), 1.75n points for
option B (.5*3+.25*1+.25*0), and .25n points for D
(.25*1+.25*0+.5*0). This shows that the presence of D
increases the attractiveness of option A in contrast to B.
Thus, Pr[A|{A,B}] < Pr[A|{A,B,D}], characteristic of the
attraction effect, which violates the principle of regularity.

With n agents:
A = 5/4 n

S = 5/4 n

Assuming n agents, the modified Borda count procedures
will assign 5/4n points to options A and S
(3*1/4+1*1/4+1*1/4+0*1/4, for each), and 6/4n to option B
(3*1/4+3*1/4+0*1/4+0*1/4). This vote reflects the
characteristics of the similarity effect: the introduction of S
into the choice set {A, B} takes away points from A and
thus creates the following preference reversal: Pr[B|{A, S,
B}] > Pr[A|{A, S, B}]. The modified Borda count procedure
unlike the traditional Borda count is thus able to model the
similarity effect accurately.
When a compromise option such as option C (discussed
previously) moves in the direction of one of the two options
and thus becomes more similar to it, the compromise effect
turns into the similarity effect, as the two similar options
will have to share the votes. Thus, moving an option from
position C to position S (Figure 1) cancels out the
compromise effect. B will receive more points than either A
or S, as shown here. The fractions of agents representing
each profile were chosen in the most conservative way
possible for the present demonstration and the results tend
to be robust across preference ratios. However, their
manipulation will allow us to make predictions about
exactly when a compromise option becomes similar enough
to another option to cease invoking the compromise effect.
By analyzing the fraction of agents representing a profile
and the influence of manipulating distances on this fraction,
it is possible to model the transition between different

How Voting Theory accounts for the Compromise effect:
Now, consider the choice set A, B, and C in Figure 1, with
C being the compromise option between A and B. The
profiles in this case are A > C> B, C > A > B, C > B > A
and B > C > A. As discussed earlier, the preference
distribution among the four possible profiles is as follows:
Borda

Borda

With n agents:
A = 7/6 n
B = 7/6 n
C = 10/6 n

Assuming that there are n agents contributing to the
decision outcome, the voting procedure using the modified
Borda count will assign 7/6n points to options A and B
(0*1/3+0*1/6+1*1/6+3*1/3, for each) and 10/6n points to
option C (1*1/3+1*1/3+3*1/6+3*1/6), reflecting the fact
that C will get chosen more often than either A or B. The
profiles also reflect the fact that in the absence of option C,
options A and B will receive the same amount of points.
Thus, the organism is not biased toward either one of the
options at the beginning of the vote, so Pr[A|{A, B}] =
Pr[A|{A, C}] = Pr[B{B, C}] but Pr[A{A, B, C}] < Pr[C{A,

employed. In other words, voting models can be used to
make novel predictions about the boundary conditions and
relationships between different decision anomalies.

made by the model for other phenomena, such as strategy
switching and the evolution of decision-outcomes over time.
Future work should also attempt to empirically tease apart
the predictions of a voting model and those from other
computational approaches to multi-attribute choice (Roe et
al, 2001; Usher & McClelland, 2004).

Conclusion
The mathematical analysis of procedure lines proved the
existence of voting procedures that can account for the
attraction, the similarity and the compromise effect. One
example, a modified Borda Count has been presented here.
Voting geometry provides a novel approach to individual
decision-making and is attractive for various reasons. First,
a connectionist model based on voting geometry seems
plausible from a biological perspective. The assumption of
multiple independent agents parallels the literature on multiagent systems, which have been broadly applied to a
number of problems of cognition (e.g. Sun, 2001).
Additionally, the theory is easily extendable and could
accordingly provide explanations for other phenomena, such
as the employment of different decision-making strategies
under time constraints.
Consider for example the procedure line representing the
compromise effect (Figure 4). Decision Field Theory
predicts that the difference of choice probability between
the compromise option C and the extreme options A and B
increases with deliberation time (Roe et al., 2001). In other
words, the longer one deliberates, the stronger the
preference of C over A and B. This effect can be modeled
by moving toward option C on the procedure line in Figure
4, which means that the procedure employed becomes more
and more like the antiplurality vote. In other words, under
strong time constraints, only an agent’s top choice is
considered; as more time is spent in deliberation, secondary
options are given more weight. This logic provides a
computational account of the model and empirical findings
of Payne, Bettman, and Johnson’s (1993) notion of the
adaptive decision maker.
Future extensions of the model could come in many
forms. Currently the model has no way to take into account
memories of previous preference states. Additionally,
implementations of this model should consider the
stochastic nature of choice (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993).
Ideally the model would predict probability distribution
across choices as opposed to simply determining the most
frequently chosen option. It would also be worthwhile to
look at additional anomalies aside from the big three, and
see if there might be further constraints on the space of
possible voting procedures that could account for human
decision making. Future research might also focus on
exploring the effects of different assumptions about the
distributions of preferences of agents, and considering
alternative voting procedures.
Although the present voting model is very simplified, it
can nonetheless account for the three main anomalies found
in decision-making. The next step in the exploration of the
voting model would thus be to construct a connectionist
model of the voting procedure and to look at the predictions
