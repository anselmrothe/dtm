later than it did. The perceived time of two events converges
when the first is known to be the cause of the second.
In this paper we consider whether causal beliefs affect time
perception in the absence of actions that control the events.
There’s good reason to believe the converse. Recent studies
have shown that people put substantial weight on temporal
cues when inferring causal structure from observations of
events (e.g., Lagnado & Sloman, 2006), but little work
addresses whether beliefs about causal structure mediate
temporal perception.
We taught people that events conformed to a specified
causal structure and then showed the events in a temporal
order that did or did not correspond to that causal structure.
We examined whether the temporal order that people reported
was biased by the causal beliefs that were induced. Unlike
much previous work, the events were visual (movements of
sliders on a computer screen), not auditory. Nevertheless,
they occurred quickly enough to leave participants with some
uncertainty about temporal order. Faced with uncertainty, we
expected responses to be informed by prior beliefs about what
to expect, beliefs in the form of causal models. In other
words, we predicted that beliefs about the causal structure
relating visual events would affect the order in which those
events were perceived.

Abstract
Philosophers and scientists have long recognized how useful
people find the temporal order of events as a guide to
uncovering the causal relations among those events (e.g.,
Hume, 1739; Lagnado & Sloman 2004, 2006; White, 2006). In
this paper we provide evidence for the converse, that beliefs
about causation influence the perception of temporal order.
Participants that learned the structure of causal relations among
a set of slider bars on a computer screen were biased to report
the movements of the sliders as conforming to a temporal order
consistent with their causal beliefs despite the absence of a
correlation between temporal order and causal structure in the
stimuli.

Introduction
Consider a war-zone reporter that has witnessed a
confrontation between two enemies breaking a cease-fire
agreement. There is disagreement about who fired the first
shot, and this issue has diplomatic implications. Suppose that
the reporter considers one group to be the aggressor in the
conflict and the other to be defending itself. The reporter is
ethical and always reports precisely what he observes, and in
this case he claims that the aggressive group fired first. Is it
possible that his perception of the events was biased and that
the defensive group actually fired the first shot? Can beliefs
about the causal relations responsible for generating events
change the perception of those events?
It is well known that beliefs about the lexical content of an
utterance can change how the sound stream is perceived
(Warren, 1970), and the predictability of an outcome can
affect the sensory experience of that outcome (e.g.,
Blakemore et al., 2002; Witney et al., 1999). Cognitive
psychologists have long recognized that perception is not
determined wholly by the stimulus but also by prior
knowledge, expectations, and other contextual factors (e.g.,
Bruner, 1974). But is this true when understanding is abstract
and the relevant events involve a salient sensory experience?
Recent work (Haggard & Clark 2003; Haggard, Clark, &
Kalogeras, 2002) has shown that auditory perception can be
modulated by the intention to act. Someone who believes that
he or she has caused an auditory event reports that event to
have occurred earlier than it actually did, and earlier than
someone who does not believe he or she was the cause.
Moreover, the putative cause is reported to have occurred

Experiment
To assess the question of whether beliefs about causal
structure influence the perception of temporal order, we
conducted an experiment in which we induced beliefs about a
causal system, a set of three causally dependent slider bars.
Participants were then presented with the sliders moving in
temporal orders that were uncorrelated with the induced
causal beliefs and reported the temporal orders that they
observed. The temporal delays were short enough that the
task was non-trivial and we hypothesized that causal beliefs
would influence judgments given uncertain observations.
To induce causal beliefs we used an interventional learning
task that forced participants to interact with the sliders to infer
the true causal structure. Because of the ease of learning with
intervention in this paradigm (Lagnado & Sloman 2004,
2006), we expected this task to produce salient causal beliefs.

Method
Participants. Participants were 17 Brown University students
recruited by an internet advertisement and paid 8 dollars for
participation. One participant was excluded from analysis due
to computer failure.

Stimuli. Stimuli were slider bars and arrows presented on a
standard computer display. During the intervention and
observation portions of the experiment the slider bars were
arrayed in an equilateral triangle and labeled A, B and C with
A at bottom left, B at the top and C at bottom right. Each
slider bar was 2.5 cm in width and 7 cm in height and had
two positions, up and down. During the model selection
portions of the experiment, 6 grey unidirectional arrows
connecting each of the sliders to the others were present.
These arrows represented each of the possible causal relations
in the system and were used by participants to report their
inferences after making interventions. The arrows were each
6 cm long, and turned red when clicked by the participant.

Procedure Participants were told that they would be
participating in a visual task involving the computer and were
given a chance to put on any corrective lenses. A maximum
of two participants were run at a time on different computers.
Introductory instructions were presented on the screen:
Thank you for participating in this experiment. Please
read these instructions carefully. In a moment you
will be presented with a set of sliders. These sliders
move up and down and have hidden connections
between them. This means that moving one slider
might or might not cause one or both of the other
sliders to move. Your job is to figure out how the
sliders are connected.

Design All participants viewed the same causal models and
the same temporal orders for each. Models were presented to
each participant in a random order. Each of the possible three
variable acyclic two-link causal models was tested, for a total
of 12 models: 6 chain models, 3 common cause models and 3
common effect models (Figure 1).

Participants were then presented with three sliders arrayed
in an equilateral triangle and all in the down position (Figure
2). For each causal model, participants were given the
opportunity to make as many interventions as they wanted
until they believed they understood the underlying causal
relations. Causal relations were deterministic, so when a
slider was intervened on all of its effects were necessarily
activated. Participants intervened on a slider by clicking the
top portion of it with the mouse. When an intervention
occurred, all activated sliders moved simultaneously,
remained in the up position for 1 second and then returned to
the down position. When ready to report the causal model, the
participant clicked a button marked ‘ready’.

Figure 2: The screen as it appeared during the intervention
task.
When the ‘ready’ button was clicked, a new screen
appeared with the same three sliders and arrows from each
slider pointing to the other two (for example the A slider had
an arrow pointing from it toward the B slider and another
arrow pointing from it toward the C slider) for a total of six
arrows, each representing a potential relation from cause to
effect (Figure 3).

*The numbers associated with the temporal order denote the
temporal position of A, B and C respectively. For example, 123
means that A moves first, B second and C third.

Upon initiation of a temporal order, sliders moved one, two,
or three at a time. As in the intervention task, these moved
from the down position to the up position. The initiation of
movement occurred at randomized intervals by sampling the
onset time from a normal distribution. When sliders did not
move simultaneously there was a delay of 100 milliseconds
between movements. This delay was chosen to make the task
difficult enough to avoid ceiling effects but not so difficult
that participants were responding at chance.
Once all the sliders had moved a new screen appeared for
the participant to input his or her response. This screen had
three horizontal sliders marked A, B, and C (Fig 5).
Figure 3: The GUI for inputting intervention inferences.
Participants were instructed to highlight the arrows by
clicking on them to indicate how they thought the sliders
were connected. When clicked, the arrows changed from grey
to red. When the participant had chosen all of the arrows he
or she wished and clicked the ‘finished’ button, text appeared
on the screen indicating whether the model was right or
wrong. If the participant’s choice was incorrect, he or she
was returned to the intervention task to try again. This process
iterated until the participant chose the correct model. Once
this occurred another set of directions appeared:
That is Correct!!! Next you will be presented with the
same three sliders. This time they will move on their
own. These sliders have the same connections as the
ones you just figured out, however the order in which
they move may not reflect those connections. This
time your job will be to determine the order in which
the sliders moved. You will see the slider move 10
times. After each time you will indicate the order in
which they moved. Sometimes they will move right
away, other times there will be a delay, so pay close
attention.

Figure 5: The GUI for reporting temporal orders.
Participants placed each slider in one of three spatial
positions to indicate the order in which they saw the sliders
on the previous screen move. The position furthest to the left
represented the first movement, the middle position the
second movement, and the furthest right represented the third
movement. If two sliders moved at once participants placed
the corresponding sliders in the same position. If they
thought all sliders moved simultaneously they placed all the
sliders at the furthest left position. After indicating their
choices they clicked a button that took them to the next
temporal order. Once all 10 temporal orders were completed
for a causal model, participants repeated the intervention task
for the next causal model.
Upon completion of all causal models, participants were
given a questionnaire sheet with the following questions:
“While completing the experiment, did you rely more upon
temporal cues or the connectivity of the sliders to guide you
in reconstructing the order? While completing the
experiment, did you think the connectivity of the sliders that
you found was affecting the order in which they were
moving?” Further clarification was given upon request.

In the temporal order task, the same sliders were presented
along with the correct directional arrows in red indicating the
true causal model. These arrows remained on the screen while
participants completed the temporal order task to ensure that
the most current causal model was salient (Figure 4).

Analysis
Analysis of participant responses was conducted by assessing
the extent to which incorrect responses were biased in the
direction of the temporal order implied by the relevant causal
model. For each response there were three variables: the
temporal order presented, the temporal order reported by the
participant, and the causal model learned prior to the set of
observations. For analysis, each of these variables is

presentations.

prescribed temporal relations of the causal model that
generated the data is calculated.

where θ is the angle between the vectors, C is the vector
representing the temporal relations of the causal model, and
D and C are the magnitudes of the difference vector and
causal model vector respectively in the Euclidean norm. The
cosine of the angle between the difference vector and the
causal model provides a measure of the extent to which an
incorrect response is in the direction of the temporal relations
implied by the causal model. It varies from 1 to -1 with 1
implying that the response is highly consistent with the causal
model, -1 implying that the response is highly inconsistent
with the causal model and 0 implying that the response is
neither consistent nor inconsistent with the model.
Correct responses result in a difference vector of magnitude
zero as the presented and reported orders are the same. Since
the direction of such a vector is not defined, a cosine cannot
be calculated and the response is not included in the analysis.
Thus the average cosine between difference vectors and
causal models for incorrect responses serves as the dependent
measure. If there is no bias the average cosine should not be
significantly different from zero as consistent and inconsistent
responses should be equally likely. More formally, if all
participants sample responses from the set of all possible
temporal orders independently of causal model,r then the
r
average expected value of the cosine between C and D
across participants, causal models, and temporal orders can
all be shown to equal zero.

represented as a three-element vector denoting the temporal
relations. The first element represents the temporal relation
between A and B, with a 1 meaning that A occurs before B, a
0 meaning that A and B occur simultaneously, and a -1
meaning that B occurs before A. The second element
represents the A-C relation, and the third represents the B-C
relation. We represented causal models via temporal relations
derived from them. To derive the temporal order implied by
a causal model, we assumed that causes precede effects. For
instance, if in causal model X, A is a cause of B, then A
should precede B and the value of the first element of the
vector representing X is 1. A 0 in a causal model
representation means that the model does not specify the
variables’ temporal relation as in the case of causes of a
common effect or effects of a common cause. Figure 6 shows
the vector representations of all of the causal models and
temporal orders tested in the experiment.

available to participants. Participants think that they are
reporting what they see whether or not they are.
One possible mechanism for how causal beliefs affected
the responses of out participants is attentional. On this view
participants used causal information to make predictions
about the time course of events. If A was a root cause then
they expected it earlier and attended to it first. This suggests
that errors may have been driven by failures of attention.
Such attentional failures are consistent with both the
perceptual and response bias interpretations.
On the
perceptual view, events that are not attended directly are
filled-in by prior beliefs. On the response-bias view, events
that are not attended directly are more likely to be guessed
using abstract knowledge at response time. Previous work has
shown that attention can modulate temporal order perception
(Stelmach & Herdman, 1991; Haddad, Carreiro & Baldo,
2002), a finding that supports the perceptual interpretation.
Nonetheless a definitive answer requires further work.
The presence of a general bias to treat A as occurring
before B and C and B as occurring before C suggests that
causal beliefs are not the only source of information drawn on
to resolve uncertainty. Other sources might include linguistic
considerations, the spatial arrangement of the sliders, and the
spatial arrangement of the user interface for responding.
Our study suggests that not only do temporal cues influence
the learning of causal structure, but causal knowledge
influences the perception of temporal cues. This could be
taken as evidence that learning theories that rely on temporal
cue information are circular. We take it instead as evidence
that, like so many learning processes, causal learning involves
bootstrapping between uncertain abstract knowledge gleaned
from the past with uncertain perceptions about the present.

Single sample t-tests revealed average cosine values
significantly greater than zero, implying a bias in favor of the
temporal relations implied by the model, across participants
(mean = .059; SE=.024, t15=2.49, p=.025) and presented
orders (mean=.083; SE=.027, t9=3.08, p=.013). The effect
across causal models was in the right direction but not
significant (mean = .057; SE=.033, t11=1.75, p=.112).
Correct responses were 52.6% of total responses with a
range of 83.3% to 12.5% over participants, and a standard
deviation of 17.3%. Linear regression revealed that percent
correct was uncorrelated to degree of bias (r2=.09, F1,14=1.40,
p=.256). Causal model learned had no significant effect on
percent correct. Temporal order was generally unrelated to
percent correct though there were two exceptions: The
temporal order in which all three sliders moved
simultaneously was substantially easier than the others, with
94% correct responses. The order in which B and C moved
simultaneously and then A moved last was substantially
harder than the rest with only 22% correct.
Beyond the bias for reported orders to be consistent with
causal models, there was a general bias to treat A as occurring
before B and C and to treat B as occurring before C. This can
be illustrated by looking at the
r average values of the vectors
reported by participants ( R ). Since an equal number of
temporal orders were presented in which any variable
preceded any other
r variable, the average value of the
presented vectors ( P ) was 0. However, all three elements of
participants’ average reported vectors were greater than 0.
The average values of the elements representing the A-B, AC and B-C temporal relations were .07, .12 and .03
respectively implying a bias toward A in the A-B relation
which was highly significant (t1919=3.36, p<.001), toward A
in the A-C relation which was highly significant (t1919=5.79,
p<.001), and toward B in the B-C relation which was
marginally significant (t1919=1.70, p=.089).
All 16 participants indicated that their responses were
based on the perceived temporal order and not on the causal
structure.

In summary, this experiment suggests that the temporal order
of events that people report is affected by beliefs about the
causal model generating those events. When in a state of
uncertainty about what happened, people take advantage of
abstract beliefs about what should have happened to make a
report. This is analogous to using prior distributional
knowledge as information about when or how an event will
occur (Sobel et al., 2004; Tenenbaum & Griffiths, 2001).
The critical open question is whether the bias we have
reported is perceptual or operative at the response stage. Are
causal models inducing people to see events in a different
order or affecting how they decide to respond given that they
are not sure of their answer? The fact that every one of the
participants claimed that they were not using the causal model
to inform them suggests that, if the effect is due to a process
occurring during response, that process is not explicitly
