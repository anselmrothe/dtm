Abstract

Previous Attempt to Reconcile Differences

In this paper, we describe a unified account of anticipatory
coarticulatory effects and local segment duration effects
based on a segmental minimal unit of articulation. The
anticipatory coarticulatory effects are modeled using a
Jordan network and the segment duration effects are
modeled using Sigma-Pi control units. The viability of this
approach in resolving an ongoing debate between a
segmental versus syllabic minimal unit of articulation in
speech production is illustrated using a small lexicon.

One way to reconcile the differences is to assume that the
minimal unit of articulation is the segment and that
different criteria to initiate articulation are used
(Kawamoto et al., 1998; Kello, 2004). That is, an
individual could choose to initiate articulation as soon as
the initial segment is encoded (i.e., the segment criterion)
or only after the full phonological code for the whole
word becomes available (i.e., the whole word criterion).
When the whole word criterion is used, anticipatory
coarticulation would be produced to its full extent without
any local segment duration effects. The same would be
true, regardless of the criterion used, if the phonological
code for the syllable becomes available all at once. By
contrast, when articulation is initiated using the segment
criterion without the complete phonological code,
anticipatory coarticulation would only be produced when
the relevant segment (e.g., the vowel) becomes available.
Moreover, the articulation of the segment immediately
preceding the locus of processing difficulty would be
lengthened until the processing difficulty is resolved.
On the other hand, if the minimal unit of articulation is
the syllable, then the notion of an articulation criterion
becomes moot for monosyllabic words because the entire
phonological code would be available when articulation is
initiated. Under this assumption, there would be no
opportunity for local segment duration effects to be
manifested, and anticipatory coarticulation would always
be produced to its full extent. Note that these results are
indistinguishable from a segmental minimal unit of
articulation and a whole word criterion.

Minimal Unit of Articulation
Generally, the final stage of speech production is believed
to involve two broad processes: (1) phonological
encoding, in which an abstract representation (i.e.,
phonological code) of speech is generated, and (2)
articulation, in which the phonological code is realized as
overt speech. Despite wide acceptance of this framework,
debate is still ongoing with respect to the nature of the
minimal unit involved in articulation. Some researchers
favor the phonological word (e.g., Levelt, Roelofs, &
Meyer, 1999) or the syllable (e.g., Meyer, Roelofs,
Levelt, 2003), while others favor the segment (e.g.,
Kawamoto, Kello, Jones, & Bame, 1998; Mackay, 1987).
Arguments for the syllable have typically been based on
the premise that anticipatory coarticulation, the influences
of a subsequent segment on the production of the current
segment, is a necessary and obligatory accompaniment of
speech (Fujimura & Lovins, 1978). Thus, articulation
cannot be initiated on the basis of anything smaller than
the syllable because the phonetic environment of a
segment must be known for anticipatory coarticulation
(Levelt et al., 1999; Rastle, Coltheart, Harrington, &
Palethorpe, 2000).
By contrast, Kawamoto and his colleagues have
assumed that the segment is the minimal unit of
articulation (Kawamoto, 1999; Kawamoto, Kello, Jones,
& Bame, 1998). Arguments for the segment have
generally been based on local segment duration effects,
particularly segment duration increases that are a result of
local processing difficulties in generating the
phonological code of a subsequent segment (see
Kawamoto, 1999; Kawamoto et al., 1998).

Articulatory Differences in Different Priming
Conditions
It turns out that coarticulation is not as simple as depicted
above by the syllabic perspective. The same response can
be produced with or without anticipatory coarticulation
under
different
phonological
prime
conditions
(Kawamoto, Liu, Kherlein, & Johnson, 2007; Whalen,
1990). In Whalen’s study, participants produced four
VCV utterances, all beginning with the same vowel, in
two experimental conditions. In one, participants knew
beforehand what the consonant was but not the second
vowel, and in the other, they knew what the second vowel
1151

one participant, produced in the Vowel-Primed condition (left) and the Vowel-not-Primed condition (right).
was but not the consonant. Whalen found well-defined
anticipatory vowel-to-vowel coarticulation effects
between syllables only when the vowel was primed.
Kawamoto et al. (2007) extended Whalen’s results to
anticipatory vowel-to-consonant coarticulation within a
syllable. They had participants produce four monosyllabic
CCVC words, spill, spool, still, and stool, under one of
two priming conditions, Vowel-Primed and Vowel-notPrimed. In the Vowel-Primed condition, participants
produced tokens of one of two 2nd segment minimal pairs
(i.e., spill-still or spool-stool), and in the Vowel-notPrimed condition, participants produced tokens of one of
two vowel minimal pairs (i.e., spill-spool or still-stool).
These conditions created two situations where the
segments of a word, except for the divergent segments,
were phonologically primed.
To allow participants their choice of criterion to initiate
articulation, the standard naming task was used (see
Rastle et al., 2000). Kawamoto and colleagues found that
the majority of participants exhibited extensive
anticipatory coarticulation differences between the tokens
of a particular vowel minimal pair in both conditions.
However, a small number of participants only showed
extensive anticipatory coarticulation differences in the
Vowel-Primed condition; there was no difference in the
Vowel-not-Primed condition. The mean power spectra for
the vowel minimal pair, still-stool, measured at the
temporal midpoint of the fricative spectra, and their
respective differences for one of these participants are
displayed in Figure 1. In addition, Kawamoto and
colleagues found that the duration of the initial segment
was significantly longer in the Vowel-Primed condition,
where the initial segment immediately preceded the
unknown segment, than in the Vowel-not-Primed

condition, where the initial segment was a segment
removed from the unknown segment.
Together, the findings of Kawamoto and colleagues
(2007) and Whalen (1990) are fully consistent with the
minimal unit of articulation being the segment for which
anticipatory coarticulation effects are not a necessary and
obligatory accompaniment of speech. At the same time,
the findings of Kawamoto and colleagues (2007) showed
that articulation could proceed on the basis of either the
segment or whole word criteria. When it is done so on the
basis of the segment criterion, anticipatory coarticulation
effects are only produced when the relevant segments are
known. When the criterion to initiate articulation is the
whole word, anticipatory coarticulation effects are
produced regardless of the priming condition.

A Connectionist Implementation Using a
Sub-syllabic Minimal Unit of Articulation
In this section, we outline a connectionist network that
models the articulation process in which the minimal unit
of articulation is the segment. The network takes as input
the output of the phonological encoding process (not
modeled here) corresponding to the phonological code of
a syllable (the "plan"), and generates a sequence of
articulatory movements (see Figure 2). The criterion to
initiate articulation is reflected by the nature of the input
to the network — a complete syllabic code corresponds to
the whole word criterion and an incomplete syllabic code
that can be incrementally updated to reflect ongoing
processing corresponds to the segment criterion. The goal
of the current implementation is to demonstrate how the
presence and absence of coarticulation effects as well

and the constriction of the glottis (see Table 1).

Network Architecture
The network consists of two components — a Jordan net
that produces a sequence of articulatory movements from
a plan, and a control structure that controls how long the
current segment is articulated. For the current purposes,
the model was designed to simply produce one segment
with each sweep, starting from the neutral state and
returning to it when articulation is complete.
Jordan Net. A Jordan net was chosen to implement the
articulatory pathway because its ability to simulate
anticipatory coarticulation is well documented (e.g.,
Jordan, 1986). Similar approaches to model speech
production using a Jordan network have previously been
proposed (e.g., Dell, Juliano, Govindjee, 1993; Plaut &
Kello, 1999). This component of the network contained
three fully connected layers: The first contained the plan
and state units; the second the hidden units; and the third
the output units. However, the connections between
output-to-state and state-to-state are one-to-one. In the
current network, the decay parameter is set to equal 1
(i.e., δ=1; no decay). However, due to the actions of the
Sigma-Pi connections from the control structure (see
below), only the output of a single sweep will be buffered
in the state units at any given time.

Figure 2: The basic architecture of the current model.
The black arrows denote full connectivity with the
exception that the connections between output-tostate and state-to-state are one-to-one. The gray
arrows denote that only some inputs are fed into the
next layer (see the discussion of the Control Structure
below).
as local segment duration effects can be accounted for
when the segment criterion is used.

Control Structure. The control structure is a simple feed
forward network that acts as a monitoring and gating
mechanism that checks the segment currently being
produced with what has to be produced next. If
information about the following segment is available, the
following segment will be produced in the next sweep. If
not, the model will simply continue the articulation of the
current segment until the next segment becomes available.

The Representations Used
The input representation used here is a slot based local
representation scheme that specifies the segmental
content, syllabic frame, and encoding status of a metrical
slot (see Table 1). The output and state representations
correspond to the syllabic position of the current segment
being produced and a small set of articulatory dimensions:

This control is accomplished by taking as inputs the
unspecified segment units and the metrical slot units (i.e.,
the “-“ and “$” units in Table 1) from the plan unit and
the state units that buffer the output of the current
segment units. The unspecified segment units denote
whether or not the identity of a particular segment is
unknown (1=”on” or unknown), the metrical slot units
denote whether or not a particular metrical slot is
specified in the word frame (1=”on” or specified), and the
current segment units denote the syllabic position of the
segment produced in the previous sweep. Together, these
units feed into 2 control units, one for the Sigma-Pi
connections to the output-to-state connections and the
other for the Sigma-Pi connections to the state-to-state
connections, and turn them “on” or “off” accordingly.
Specifically, the output-to-state connections will be
turned “off” and the state-to-state connections turned “on”
if the input to the unspecified segment unit and the
metrical slot unit that immediately follows the segment
produced in the previous sweep are both “on”. Otherwise,
the output-to-state connections will be “on” and the stateto-state connections will be “off” (see Table 2). In the
former, the model will behave as a feed forward network
that will produce either the same or a modified version
(e.g., if the incomplete plan is updated incrementally from
s___l→ s_ool→stool, the articulation of the /s/ will
transition from uncoarticulated to fully coarticulated when
the vowel becomes known) of the articulatory output from
an earlier sweep. In the latter, the model will behave as a
Jordan net with only the previous time step buffered.

to show that the relationship between what is being
produced and the availability of what has to be produced
next can be learned and used accordingly. Training of the
control structure was carried out separately on a
representative set of input and output sequences that
covered the range of possible circumstances that can arise
in the experiment (described above) carried out by
Kawamoto et al. (2007). The network was trained for
2000 epochs, with a learning rate = 1 and momentum = 0.

Testing the Network
Simulation of the Vowel-Primed and Vowel-not-Primed
results for the whole word and segment criteria was
carried out. For the whole word criterion, input to the
network corresponds to the complete plan from the outset
(i.e., the training input sequences) for both priming
conditions. However, for the segment criterion, the initial
plans in the test sequences included only those segments
that were known beforehand (i.e., s_ool, s_ill, st__l, or
sp__l) with the unspecified segment represented by the ““ unit in the appropriate metrical slot. The missing
segment was added later for each target (i.e., spill, spool,
still, or stool). In all, 8 novel test sequences were used: 4
corresponding to the Vowel-Primed sequences (e.g.,
s_ool→spool, s_ool→stool) and 4 corresponding to the
Vowel-not-Primed sequences (e.g., st__l→stool and
st__l→still). For these input sequences, the changing
input changes the status of the control units.
To demonstrate the presence and absence of
coarticulatory effects as well as local segment duration
effects, the outputs of the network were computed offline
from the weight matrices of the Jordan net and the control
structure. The 8 novel test sequences were lengthened to
10 sweeps beginning with the neutral state. An
incomplete plan was then presented for 5 sweeps in the
Vowel-Primed sequences and 6 sweeps in the Vowel-notPrimed sequences. Next the complete plan corresponding
to one of the four targets was presented in the subsequent
sweeps. Finally, the neutral state was presented again as
the final sweep. Note that the number of sweeps that the
incomplete plan was presented in the novel test sequences
was simply to show that articulation could be initiated
long before the complete phonological code is available.

Coarticulatory Effects. For the current demonstration in
which the spread and rounded vowels are being
articulated, the articulatory dimensions of interest are the
vertical and horizontal lip separations. The lip
configurations for the word stool produced with the
complete training input sequence and the novel test
sequences s_ool→stool and st__l→stool in which the
input is initially not a complete syllabic representation are
displayed in Figure 3. The results are very clear. The
outputs of the novel test sequence s_ool→stool are almost
identical to the outputs corresponding to the training input
sequence for stool. For both sequences, the /s/es were
produced with a large vertical lip separation and a small

Training Network
The Jordan net was trained on the Tlearn simulator
(Plunkett & Elman, 1997). The training corpus for the
Jordan net consisted of the input and output sequences
corresponding to the words sip, soup, sit, suit, spill, spool,
still, and stool. Training was carried out for 3000 epochs,
with a learning rate = 0.05 and momentum = 0.
Although the behavior of the control structure is that of
a simple table lookup and can be hardwired, the control
structure was trained in the simulations described below

horizontal lip separation that corresponded to the pursing
of the lips associated with rounding. However, the lip
configuration during the production of the initial /s/ for
the novel test sequence st__l→stool varied little from the
neutral state (a lip configuration that is slight parted, but
neither pursed nor spread) and was markedly different
from the lip configurations of both the novel sequence
s_ool→stool and the training sequence for stool.
Similar results with respect to lip spreading in the /s/
emerged with the training sequence for still and the novel
test sequences s_ill→still and st__l→still (not displayed).
The overall pattern of coarticulatory effects for the
training sequences for stool and still and their 4 respective

novel test sequences (described above) was also observed
for the training sequences for spool and spill and their
respective novel test sequences.
Local Segment Duration Effects. The results for the
novel Vowel-Primed sequence s_ool→stool, showed that
the articulation of the segment immediately preceding the
unknown segment is lengthened until it becomes available
(Table 3). Specifically, in sweep 2, the network produces
the articulatory parameters for initial segment specified in
the plan (i.e., /s/) and denotes that the segment being
produced is the initial segment (the current segment
units). However, in sweep 3, the input to the control units

sequence as well as the actions of the control units at each sweep are displayed. Information for the 2nd segment

unknown, and thus the control units turn “on” the state-tostate connections and turn “off“ the output-to-state
connections. These actions turn the Jordan net into a feed
forward network that simply updates the output of the
earlier sweep. In essence, the articulation of the initial
segment is lengthened until sweep 7, when the 2nd
segment becomes known. At that point, control units turn
the network back into the Jordan net and produced 2nd
segment in sweep 7 and the remaining segments in the
subsequent sweeps.

Conclusion
The results of the current simulations offer a succinct
demonstration that a single network using a sub-syllabic
minimal unit can account for both the presence and
absence of anticipatory coarticulation effects as well as
local segment duration effects. This approach can easily
be extended to other local segment duration effects that
can arise from a variety of processing difficulties in
speech production. Moreover, the current network can be
coupled to existing models, such as that of Dell et al.
(1993), to account for a wider range of empirical data
(e.g., latency data). Such an extension provides a way to
explore the interplay between different dependent
measures such as latency and segment duration.
