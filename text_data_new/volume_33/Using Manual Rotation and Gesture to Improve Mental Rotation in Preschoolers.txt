Abstract

A recent meta-analysis investigating whether spatial skills
such as MR are malleable revealed that spatial skills can be
trained, and that positive results of training can last over
time and can be transferred to both near and far tasks (Uttal,
et al., under review). Further, the meta-analysis showed that
training leads to the greatest effect sizes when participants
are children under age 13. Relative to research in training
MR in adults, the benefits of training children have been
less clearly defined. However, identifying the methods that
lead to improved spatial skills particularly in young children
is necessary in order to make greater strides in bridging
gender and socioeconomic gaps that are present at very
early ages.
Differences in MR skills are evident early on. Levine and
colleagues (1999) found that even among preschoolers, boys
performed more accurately than girls on a two-dimensional
spatial task requiring mental rotation and/or translation. In a
more recent study, Levine et al. (2005) reported that sex
differences on spatial tasks in elementary school children
varied as a function of socioeconomic status (SES). In
higher- and middle- SES groups, the study replicated the
common sex difference finding: boys performed more
accurately than girls. However, in the lower-SES group,
boys and girls performed equally (and more poorly than the
other children) on the spatial tasks. The authors suggest that
lower-SES families may have less access to spatially
relevant toys and activities and thus neither boys nor girls
have well developed spatial skills. In contrast, higher- and
middle- SES families do have access to such stimulation.
However, boys are more likely than girls to engage in
spatial activities (e.g., play that promotes the development
of spatial skill such as block building and playing video
games). The fact that the sex difference was present in only
certain groups of children suggests that engaging in spatial
activities during childhood might contribute to the
commonly reported male advantage for MR.
One such spatial activity is computer game play. Training
studies that incorporate computer games have been found to
improve mental rotation skills across gender and age groups.
Both women and men showed improved mental rotation
skills following longitudinal spatial computer game play
that involved rotating two-dimensional blocks to fit within a
pattern (Terlecki, Newcombe, & Little, 2008). Computer
game training using a spatial game of weights and pulleys
eliminated sex differences altogether in adolescents
(McClurg & Chaille, 1987). Thus, computer games offer a
unique opportunity for investigating spatial training

We report the effects on accuracy and reaction time at a
mental rotation task for four year old subjects who were either
given practice rotating objects on a computer screen by
turning a joystick or gesturing about rotating objects on a
computer screen. We found that training children to gesture
about rotation improves performance on MR. Children who
were given practice rotating objects with a joystick do not
show the same level of RT improvement as children who
either gestured about movement or who simply practiced the
task over the course of the experiment without any training.
Keywords: mental rotation, gesture, embodied cognition,
preschoolers.

Introduction
In a typical Mental Rotation (MR) task, a subject is shown
two stimuli, a comparison stimulus and a rotated stimulus,
and is asked to respond as quickly and as accurately as
possible as to whether the two stimuli are rotational variants
or not. Reaction Time (RT) data from such studies show
that subjects are increasingly slow to respond correctly as
the level of angular disparity between the rotated stimulus
and the comparison stimulus increases (e.g., Shepard &
Metzler, 1971). This data pattern suggests that subjects are
actively constructing mental representations of the stimuli
and are executing mental emulations of physical rotation.
One other common finding involving mental rotation is that
men outperform women on a variety of mental rotation tasks
(e.g., see Linn & Petersen, 1985 for a classic meta-analysis).
A more recent study replicating this finding also found that
men use a strategy involving actually mentally rotating
stimuli, whereas women have a tendency to use analytic
strategies that do not involve physical rotation (Geiser,
Lehmann, & Eid, 2006). In other words, men tended to be
“rotators” who used a strategy of mentally rotating objects
to solve spatial problems, whereas women tended to be
“non-rotators” who used feature matching or other strategies
not reliant on mental transformation of the objects. There
are also individual differences in MR ability, regardless of
gender.
These gender and individual differences are important,
given the relation of spatial skills such as mental rotation to
success in STEM (science, technology, engineering and
math) disciplines. Spatial skills predict STEM interest and
achievement as well as entry into STEM careers, even after
controlling for verbal and mathematical skills, (e.g., Wai,
Lubinski, & Benbow, 2009).

methods since they are effective at increasing spatial skills
among both males and females, they are increasingly
becoming more available to a range of SES groups, and they
are a popular source of entertainment among children.
In many video games, an individual manipulates their
field of view or an object on the screen, often through
rotating a joystick. Moulton and Kosslyn (2009) have
argued that MR is an instance of mental emulation––a
process that involves activation of visual and motor systems
that overlap with cognitive resources that would be used to
actually manipulate 3D objects. In fact, a number of studies
have shown that movement can interfere with MR. For
example, Wexler, Kosslyn, and Berthoz (1998)
demonstrated that the speed of mental rotation is affected by
the direction, angle and speed at which participants rotate
their hands while doing an MR task. This suggests that
perhaps training subjects to move in certain ways could
have positive effects on MR performance. In fact, training
involving using a joystick to rotate two-dimensional figures
increased MR performance and eliminated sex differences
in adolescents (Weidenbauer & Jansen-Osmann, 2007).
Training effects observed by Weidenbauer and colleagues
extended to a somewhat broader range of contexts than only
those experienced during training.
Hand gestures, a specific type of movement, have also
been studied with respect to MR. Analyses of people’s
spontaneous production indicates that people tend to gesture
when talking about MR tasks (Chu & Kita, 2008). Further,
5 year old children perform better on a simple twodimensional MR task if they gesture about movement
during their explanations than if they do not, and boys are
more likely to gesture about movement during an MR task
than are girls (Ehrlich et al., 2006). Gesturing not only
reflects a young child’s knowledge of the MR task, but it
can also play a role in changing that knowledge. Recent
findings suggest that children who were told to produce
gestures that mimicked physical rotation were more likely to
profit from instruction on a 2-D MR task than children who
were told to point at the objects that needed to be mentally
rotated (Zinchenko, et al., 2010). What remains to be seen
is whether gesture (representational movement) and joystick
rotation (actual movement) are equally useful in improving
children’s MR performance.
Thus, the current study examines these two possible
training methods. One group of children (rotation training
condition) used a joystick to rotate a rotated animal picture
to face right-side-up next to a comparison animal picture.
Another group of children (gesture training condition) were
instructed to gesture how they would rotate the rotated
animal picture to face right-side-up next to the comparison
animal picture. These two types of training allowed us to
investigate how MR training impacts young children using
either transitive action (e.g., manually rotating a joystick) or
more abstract representational action (e.g, gesture the
movement needed to match the orientation of a rotated
animal picture into right-side-up alignment with another).
We hypothesized that engaging in rotation movement, either

manual rotation or gesturing rotation, would improve spatial
performance, whereas engaging in a verbally focused
computer task (no training condition) would not elicit
spatial improvement to the same degree. The question of
interest here involves the relative effectiveness of actual
rotation vs. gesture. On one hand, children in the rotation
condition receive visual feedback during training—they
could see the object rotating as well as the outcome of
having rotated the object. On the other hand, children in the
gesture condition might visualize the rotation (as well as
having the positive benefit of engaging the motor system),
as they cannot see the objects move. To address whether
actually moving the objects or gesturing the movement is
more beneficial to mental rotation skill, we compared preto posttest performance for the two groups on the trained
task as well as well as on a transfer task, as well as reaction
time on the trained task.

Method
Participants
Sixty-three four-year-old children participated in this study.
Participants were recruited from Chicago and nearby
suburbs. Participants were randomly assigned to either the
rotation training condition (N=20, 11 girls; M=4.49 years,
SD=0.36 years), the gesture training condition (N=22, 10
girls; M=4.59 years, SD=0.49 years) or the no training
condition (N=21, 11 female; M=4.50 years SD=0.38 years).

Design and Procedure
The experiment followed a pretest-training-posttest
paradigm. Children were randomly assigned to one of three
training conditions, described in detail below. Children
completed some of the activities on a PC with a 17”
monitor. Input devices included a two-button child-friendly
mouse and a sidewinder precision joystick.
Pretest During the pretest, all children first completed the
Child Mental Transformation Task (CMTT; the transfer task
in this particular experiment), then the Mental Rotation Task
(MROT; the trained task in this particular experiment).
All children first completed 12 trials of the CMTT
(Levine, et al., 1999). The task presents a child with two
halves of a 2-D shape that has been cut by its vertical line of
symmetry. The two halves are rotated and/or translated
apart from one another. Children are shown four possible
target shapes and are asked which shape would be made if
the two halves were put together. This task is often used to
study MR and spatial visualization skills and strategies in
preschool children. In the current study, we did not train
children using the CMTT; it serves as a transfer task
measure.
Children then moved onto the pretest section of the
trained task. The Mental Rotation Task, or MROT, requires
children to decide as quickly and accurately as possible
whether two animals, presented side by side on a PC screen,

460

are walking in the same direction (once they’re both on their
feet). The picture on the left (comparison picture) is on its
feet and facing either right or left. The picture on the right
(rotated picture) is presented in one of four angular
disparities relative to the comparison picture. The rotated
picture (when turned to be on its feet) was identical for the
12 ‘same’ trials and was mirror-reversed for the 12
‘different’ trials. Children were asked to answer “same” if
the (rotated) animal on the right side of the screen would be
walking in the same direction or in a different direction than
the (comparison) animal on the left side of the screen
(already on its feet). 12 practice trials were administered to
ensure understanding of the task, and children received
feedback. Following these trials, 24 pretest trials were
administered with no feedback. On each test trial, two
images of the same animal (either an elephant, fox, alligator,
cow, leopard, or horse) were presented simultaneously.
Each trial started with a presentation of a grey fixation
square followed by the two drawings and a prompt for the
child to respond by pressing a “same” or “different” button.
On the first trial, the experimenter pointed to the pictures
on the screen and said, “This game shows two animals on
the screen. One of them is turned, and you have to decide
whether the two animals are going the same direction or
different directions. This one (pointing to the rotated animal
on the right) isn’t on its feet. If we turned it on its feet, does
it look the same as this one (pointing to the comparison
animal on the right)? Are they going the same direction or
different directions? Try to pick the answer as fast as you
can.” The children were asked to click the left (blue) button
on the mouse if both animals were heading in the same
direction or the right (red) button on the mouse if the
animals were heading in different directions.

In the gesture training condition, the experimenter
introduced the training phase by saying, “This time the
animals are always facing the same direction, but one of
them is turned around and not on its feet. Help the animal
that is turned around to get right-side-up and on its feet by
using your hand to rotate him around so the animal matches
the first one on its feet, like this (experimenter demonstrated
a grabbing and rotating gesture near the animal).” Children
were instructed to touch their hand to the screen and show
how they would rotate the animal to move it on its feet. 36
trials, 12 with incorrect/correct feedback followed by 24
without feedback, were administered. In the gesture
training condition, the rotated animal picture on the right did
not actually move during training.
An unrelated game was used as a filler task for children in
the no training condition. In one trial of this activity, a letter
falls from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen.
The task requires the child to select and click the letter that
follows the falling letter on a child-size keyboard before the
letter hits the bottom of the screen. The program ran for 10
minutes (the approximate time of the rotation and gesture
training conditions).
Posttest At posttest, all children completed 48 trials of the
MROT with novel animal stimuli that had not been seen at
pretest or during training (bear; donkey; dog; pig; tiger;
goat; camel; lion; rhinoceros; deer; sheep; raccoon).
Children were first reminded of the directions and then were
asked to complete the task as quickly and accurately as
possible. Following the MROT (trained task), children
completed 12 novel trials of the CMTT (transfer task).

Results

Training Each subject was randomly assigned to one of
three training conditions: rotation training condition, gesture
training condition, or no training condition.
In the rotation training condition, the experimenter
introduced the training phase by saying, “This time the
animals are always facing the same direction, but one of
them is turned around and not on its feet. Help the animal
that is turned around to get right-side-up and on its feet by
rotating the joystick until the animal matches the one on its
feet. See, if you turn the stick to the right, the animal moves
that way, and if you turn the stick to the left, the animal
moves that way. Make sure you turn the animal so that both
of them look exactly the same. Try to match them up as fast
as you can.” Using a joystick to manipulate the stimuli,
children were instructed to click the center (green) button on
the joystick when they felt the two animals matched. 36
trials, 12 with correct/incorrect feedback presented
immediately after the green button was clicked, followed by
24 without correct/incorrect feedback, were administered.
In the rotation training condition, the animal picture on the
right actually moved in response to the child’s joystick
rotation.

Accuracy on Trained Task (MROT)
Raw accuracy data for the MROT at pretest and at posttest
are presented in Table 1. Since previous studies have found
that simply practicing mental rotation improves
performance (see Baenninger & Newcombe, 1989), we
predicted that all subjects would improve from pretest to
posttest. Average accuracy on the MROT at pretest was
66.07% (SE=2.25%); accuracy at posttest was 71.92%
(SE=2.26%), a significantly higher score (t(62)=3.31,
p<0.01). All subjects became more accurate at the MROT
from pretest to posttest, regardless of condition.
To investigate the relative improvement from pretest to
posttest by condition, we first calculated 4 change scores
(one for each angular disparity) for each subject by
extracting standardized residuals from a linear model
predicting posttest accuracy from pretest accuracy. These
change scores represent each subject’s improvement from
pretest to posttest relative to all other subjects (similar to a
z-score), accounting for accuracy at pretest. As such, they
provide information about the benefit of each training
condition relative the others. We entered these change
scores into a repeated-measures ANOVA with Condition (3:

461

rotation training, gesture training, no training) and Sex (2:
male, female) as between subjects variables and Angular
Disparity (4: 157.5, 122.5, 67.5, 22.5) as a within subjects
variable. Age was entered as a covariate.

each subject, by only including RTs within 2 standard
deviations of each subjects’ mean, figured separately for
pretest and for posttest. Raw RT data (for trials meeting
these criteria) for the MROT at pretest and at posttest are
presented in Table 3. Log-transformed RT scores
(calculated in the service of normalizing skewed RT data)
are used in all analyses and subsequent calculations
presented in this section.

We found a main effect of Condition on change scores,
F(2, 56)=3.85, p<0.05. Planned contrasts using the
Bonferroni correction showed that, relative to subjects in the
no training condition (M=-0.28, SE=0.15), subjects in the
gesture training condition (M=0.30, SE=0.15) improved
more from pre to posttest. Rotation training condition
change scores (M=-0.04, SE=0.15) did not significantly
differ from either of the other conditions, and are
intermediate in terms of the other two conditions. Since
everyone improved from pretest to posttest, subjects in the
rotation training condition, who had scores close to zero,
can be thought of as “average improvers”. Similar to zscores, a change score of zero represents average
improvement. In contrast, subjects in the no training
condition improved least, and subjects in the gesture
training condition improved most. This difference between
gesture and no training conditions was significant. These
findings all controlled for age, and no other main effects or
interactions in the ANOVA were significant.

We predicted an overall practice-effect type of increase in
reaction time on the MROT from pretest to posttest.
Overall average RT at pretest was 5256 ms (SE=389 ms)
(logRT: M=3.65, SE=0.03); overall average RT at posttest
was 3022 ms (SE=257 ms) (logRT: M=3.38, SE=0.04).
Overall, logRT (and thus RT1) decreased with practice on
the task (t(62)=6.43, p<0.001).
To investigate the relative improvement from pretest to
posttest by training condition, we calculated 4 change scores
(one for each angular disparity) for each subject by
extracting standardized residuals from a linear model
predicting posttest RT from pretest RT2. As with the
accuracy change scores reported above, RT change scores
represent each subject’s improvement over time relative to
all other subjects (like a z-score), and also account for
accuracy at pretest. With RT, though, negative change

Reaction Time on Trained Task (MROT)
Reaction Times (RTs) were analyzed only for trials where
subjects responded correctly. We also removed outliers for

scores represent relatively greater speed improvement while
positive change scores represent relatively less speed
improvement. As with accuracy, we entered these RT
change scores into a repeated-measures ANOVA, with
Condition (3: rotation, gesture, control) and Sex (2: male,
female) as between subjects variables, and Angular
Disparity (4: 157.5, 122.5, 67.5, 22.5) as a within subjects
variable. Age was entered as a covariate. The GreenhouseGeisser correction was used to account for non-sphericity of
the change score data3.
We found a main effect of Condition, F(2, 49)=3.80,
p<0.05. Planned contrasts using the Bonferroni correction
revealed a significant difference between change scores for
chidren in the gesture training condition (M=-0.28,
SE=0.19) and change scores for subjects in the rotation
training condition (M=0.44, SE=0.21).
There was a
marginally significant difference (p<0.08) between the
rotation condition and the no training condition (M=-0.22,
SE=0.19), and no difference between the gesture and control
conditions. Recall that, with RTs, negative change scores
represent relatively greater speed improvement. Though all
participants got faster from pretest to posttest, RTs of those
who practiced actually rotating objects during training
improved least from pre to posttest. In contrast, either
gesturing about the physical rotation of objects during
training or completing an unrelated control task resulted in
relatively greater speed improvement from pretest to
posttest.
However, this finding is qualified by a significant Sex x
Condition interaction, F(2, 49)=5.52, p<0.01. ANOVAs
including Condition and Angular Disparity and controlling
for Age were calculated, separately for boys and for girls.
The ANOVA for boys did not reveal any significant main
effects or interactions (no training M=-0.57, SE=0.31;
gesture M=0.23, SE=0.28; rotation M=0.11, SE=0.37, all
ps>0.30). In other words, boys got faster on the MROT
from pretest to posttest, but none of the training conditions
showed any significant benefit over the other with respect to
RT. This suggests a pure practice effect for boys’ speed in
MR. In contrast, the ANOVA for girls showed a significant
main effect of Condition, F(2, 26)=10.15, p<0.001. Girls in
the no training condition had average change scores of
exactly 0.00 (SE=0.25). The speed of girls who were in the
no training condition (and so simply practiced MR over the
course of the experiment) improved; this represents a
baseline for girls’ speed improvement. RTs of girls in the
rotation training condition showed a trend toward being
significantly higher (indicating relatively less improvement
in the case of RT; M=0.82, SE=0.23; p<0.08) than girls in
the no training condition. There was not a significant
difference between gesture training condition change scores
(M=-0.73, SE=0.26) and no training condition change
scores (p>0.15).
However, there was a significant
difference between the gesture and rotation training
conditions (p<0.001). This result indicates that, for girls,
gesturing about rotation, compared to practice physically
3

rotating objects with a joystick, results in increased speed
for performing the mental rotation task (MROT). These
findings suggest that girls in the rotation training condition
may have become somewhat dependent on seeing the
outcome of rotating objects during training. Conversely,
gesturing about rotation may be particularly apt for helping
girls to visualize the outcome of rotations, resulting in a
rather large relative improvement in RT on the trained
mental rotation task.

Accuracy on Transfer Task (CMTT)
Raw accuracy data for the CMTT at pretest and at posttest
are presented in Table 3. We first asked whether practicing
MR during the MROT (in pretest and posttest for all
participants, and also in training for subjects in the rotation
and gesture training conditions) increased accuracy on the
CMTT. The CMTT focuses on MR, but is 2-D and
presented on paper instead of on a computer screen. It also
uses black outlines of shapes instead of realistic stimuli like
pictures of animals, and sometimes calls for spatial
translation instead of or in concert with rotation. As such, it
is a near transfer task. At pretest, across all subjects,
accuracy on the CMTT task was 40.61% (SE=2.04%);
accuracy at posttest was 50.66% (SE=2.92).
This
improvement was significant, t(62)=4.23, p<0.001.

To see how the training conditions differentially affected
accuracy on the CMTT, we calculated change scores for
each subject by extracting standardized residuals from a
linear model predicting posttest CMTT accuracy from
pretest CMTT accuracy. Greater change scores represent
relatively greater improvement on the transfer task from
pretest to posttest. Change scores were entered into an
ANOVA with Condition (3: gesture, rotation, control) and
Sex (2: male, female) as between subjects variables and Age
as a covariate. The ANOVA only revealed a main effect of
Condition, F(2, 56)=8.18, p<0.001. Change scores for
subjects in the rotation condition (M=0.20, SE=0.20) and
for subjects in the gesture condition (M=0.43, SE=0.20)
were significantly better than change scores for subjects in
the no training condition (M=-0.64, SE=0.20). Change
scores for the gesture and rotation conditions were not
significantly different from one another. In other words, the
additional practice on the MROT that subjects in the gesture
and rotation training conditions received improved their

RT data was non-spherical in general, at pretest and at posttest.

Discussion
In terms of accuracy on a MR task, children who got
practice gesturing about rotating objects improved most
from pretest to posttest, compared to children who
participated in an unrelated task during the training session.
Children who had practice actually rotating objects showed
average improvement compared to the other conditions.
Interestingly, children in both of the gesture training and no
training conditions got faster at MR from pretest to posttest,
while RT for children in the rotation training condition did
not improve as much from pretest to posttest. This pattern
of findings suggests that a) training children to gesture
about rotation improves performance on MR; b) giving
children practice physically rotating objects may lead them
to become somewhat dependent on this physical rotation—
these children do not show the same level of RT
improvement as children who either gestured about
movement or who simply practiced MR over the course of
the experiment.
In terms of transfer, children who
participated in either training condition showed relatively
greater improvement on a non-computer MR task than did
children who did not receive any training. In this case, it is
difficult to say whether the training conditions had any
benefit besides exposing children to more practice on the
task. In this study, we did not find any effects of angular
disparity on learning—subjects improved equally for
rotations at each of the four angular disparities. With one
exception, discussed below, we did not find sex differences
as far as training benefits.
In our study, girls were especially likely to show faster
RTs when they were given practice gesturing about rotation.
Previous studies have shown that boys are naturally more
likely to gesture about rotation and also that spontaneously
gesturing about the rotating objects is positively associated
with performance on an MR task (Ehrlich et al., 2006). This
suggests that encouraging (particularly girls) to embody
concepts of rotation and to express those concepts by
gesturing improves their MR performance.
Future research could address whether gesture vs. rotation
training transfers to tasks that are farther from MR, but still
related. Future research could also investigate how long the
positive effects of training last. Lastly, studies could be
conducted that delineate the mechanisms behind gesture and
manual rotation in improving mental rotation and other
spatial skills.
