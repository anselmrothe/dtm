effects across languages, and have observed a number of
interesting patterns, for example: (1) facilitation for
translation equivalents is usually larger than that for
semantically related words (Basnight-Brown & Altarriba,
2007); and (2) priming effects in the L1-L2 direction (from
first language primes to second language targets) are often
found stronger than those in the L2-L1 direction, which is
referred to as “priming asymmetry” (Jiang & Foster, 2001).
Although it is widely accepted that cross-language
priming effects are real, the exact nature of this
phenomenon has not been studied extensively or
systematically, in particular with regard to the bilingual’s
L2 proficiency from a development point of view. It might
be possible to compare results from different studies with
participants having varied L2 proficiency levels, but such
comparisons must take into consideration the following: (1)
different studies use very different experimental settings
(see discussion of methodological issues in Altarriba &
Basnight-Brown, 2007); and (2) the criteria used to measure
participants’ L2 proficiency can be quite different. Some
attempts have been made to study the development of
priming effects across languages with similar writing scripts
(i.e. English and Spanish; see Kiran & Lebel, 2007), but not
much work has been done with bilinguals from languages of
different writing systems (e.g., Chinese and English; but see
a recent work of “semantic competitor priming” by Li &
MacWhinney, in press).
The current study aims at filling this gap. In particular, we
first designed our experiment to control a host of variables
which might have influences on priming (such as word
length, frequency, relatedness proportion, nonword ratio, etc.
Altarriba & Basnight-Brown, 2007; McNamara, 2005). We
thenran a lexical decision task on three groups of ChineseEnglish bilinguals with different L2 (English) proficiency
levels and learning history: low L2 proficiency, high L2
proficiency but without study abroad experience, and high
L2 proficiency group with at least one year of experience
living in US. We examined the priming effects from these
three groups of participants with regard to a computational
model of bilingual lexical organization.

Abstract
In this paper we describe an experimental study of crosslanguage priming effects between Chinese and English. The
priming effects for both translation equivalents and
semantically related word pairs were examined from a
developmental aspect, in particular under three different
situations according to bilinguals’ second language (English)
proficiency level measured by CPVT and language history
questionnaire, and learning experience determined by whether
they have lived in a foreign country. The results match up
with previous findings, in terms of the larger effects of
priming from L1 to L2 than from L2 to L1 (“priming
asymmetry”) and the stronger facilitation for translation
priming than semantic priming. More importantly, our study
demonstrates how such asymmetries in priming change as the
bilinguals’ L2 learning history changes. These findings are
discussed in light of current models of bilingual lexical
memory.
Keywords: Bilingualism; cross-language priming; Chinese.

Introduction
Cross-language priming is a widely used experimental
paradigm in psycholinguistic research to study bilingual
lexical representation and organization. . In this paradigm,
cross-language word pairs (semantically related or
translation equivalents) are presented to participants
sequentially and participants are required to give a timed
response (such as lexical decision or word naming). The
method tests if bilinguals show response time differences to
pairs of prime-target words that differ in their semantic
relatedness. A faster reaction time to related pairs across
languages (e.g., prime from the first language and target
from the second language) is usually explained as a result of
facilitation caused by the implicit spreading of activation
from the prime word to the target word in bilinguals’ mental
lexicon, which indicates that the bilingual’s two lexicons
share a common conceptual memory representation (cf.
Pavelnko, 2009).
Many cross-language priming experiments have been
conducted in the past decades (see a detailed review in
Altarriba & Basnight-Brown, 2007). In most studies
researchers have found translation and semantic priming

proficiency levels (r(58)=.70, p < .001). This result verifies
the validity and consistency of our two methods used to
evaluate bilinguals’ L2 proficiency level. In addition, a oneway ANOVA reveals significant differences among the
CPVT scores of the three groups, F(2,57)=60.95, p<.001,
and the post-hoc tests showed that low proficiency group’s
score was significantly lower than the other two groups
(p<.001) while there was no significant difference between
the two high proficiency groups (p=.35). Similarly, a 3
(group) x 4 (language skills) mixed ANOVA on
participants’ self-rating proficiency levels reveals significant
main effects on group (F(2,57)=31.27, p<.001) and skills
(F(3,171)=13.93, p<.001). The overall self-rating
proficiency level of the low proficiency group was 3.45
(SD=0.87), which was between “poor” and “functional” and
was significantly (p<.001) lower than the other two groups.
Whereas the difference between BNU high proficiency
group (M=4.91, SD=0.64) and the high proficiency group
with study abroad experience (M=5.27, SD=0.83) was not
significant (p=.39), both groups had rated their proficiency
level at around 5.

Methods
Participants
Sixty bilinguals were paid to participate in this study. They
were all native speakers of Chinese and had English as their
L2. Three participant groups were created according to their
L2 proficiency levels and learning history, which were
evaluated both subjectively (through a language history
questionnaire) and objectively (through an English
vocabulary test).
Language History Questionnaire Participants were asked
to fill in a language history questionnaire when they
participated in the experiment. This comprehensive
questionnaire was developed by Li, Sepanski and Zhao
(2006) and includes 25 entries covering different aspects of
participants’ language history and daily language usage. The
Chinese version of the questionnaire was used. Particularly
important for this study was the participant’s self-rating of
proficiency level on English reading, writing, speaking and
listening skills (on a 7-point scale, from 1 very poor to 7
native-like).

Controlled-Production Vocabulary-Levels Test (CPVT)
During the study, participants also took a 20-minute test of
their productive vocabulary in English under constrained
contexts (Laufer & Nation, 1999). They were asked to fill in
the missing part of words in each of 90 sentences (e.g. “He
was riding a bicycle”). The test words came from five
difficulty levels (from 2000 up to 10,000 words levels) and
the total number of correct answers was counted as a
participant’s total score.
Participant Groups Among the 60 participants, 16 were
Chinese students/scholars from universities in Boston,
Massachusetts who have been studying/working in the US
for at least one year (M=4.06 years, SD=2.82; mean age =
25.56; average age at which L2 learning began: 11.50,SD=
1.71). All of them indicated English as the language that
they would use in their working/studying environment.
They served in our experiment as the group with high L2
proficiency and with study abroad experience.
The other 44 participants were students from Beijing
Normal University (BNU), Beijing, China. Most of them do
not have experience living in an English speaking country,
and only two have temporarily visited an English speaking
country before (less than one month). Among them, 19 were
in the high proficiency group since they reported themselves
as English major or had got high scores in standardized
English tests (i.e. TOEFL, GRE, IELTS etc). Their average
age of L2 learning began from 10.53 years old (SD= 2.12).
Another 25 students were in the low proficiency group
(average age of L2 learning began: 12.12, SD= 1.48).
Table 1 shows the group average of participants’ selfrated proficiency levels, along with their mean CPVT score.
We found a strong positive correlation between the
participants’ CPVT scores and their overall self-rating L2

Materials
Critical Word Pairs To control for the words’ difficulty
levels on participants’ lexical decision, we used here the
vocabulary
from
CDI
(the
MacArthur-Bates
Communicative Development Inventories; Fenson & Dale,
1996) as the basis of our critical material 1 . In particular,
from a list of concrete nouns that English-speaking or
Chinese-speaking toddlers can produce, we selected 32
translation equivalents (like sock and 袜子 [sock]) and a list
of 32 semantically related word pairs (like nurse and 大夫
[doctor]). In addition, we created two lists of unrelated word
pairs by reshuffling the words in the two related lists so that
words that are unrelated are put into a pair. All the 128 word
pairs mentioned above contained an English prime and a
Chinese target. We then switched the order of the primes
and targets to create another 128 critical word pairs with
Chinese as primes and English as targets.
In addition, the 256 critical word pairs were split into four
versions via a Latin Square to make sure no target or prime

A small portion of words was replaced with other words that
were similar in difficulty but more fit to our experiment
requirements on length, frequency and semantic relatedness.

words would be presented twice to a same participant. Each
experiment version included 16 translation equivalents
(TR), 16 unrelated translation pairs (TU), 16 semantic
related pairs (SR), and 16 semantic unrelated pairs (SU). In
each category, half of the pairs had English words as the
target words, and the other half had Chinese as targets.

Relatedness Proportion (RP) & Nonword Ratio (NR) In
addition to the critical word pairs, we also created 64 pairs
of unrelated word fillers, for which we did not control their
length or frequency. Moreover, 96 word-nonword pairs
were also created. Again, half of the 160 pairs had English
as targets and another half had Chinese targets. The English
nonwords were created through the ARC Nonword
Database (Rastle, Harrington, & Coltheart, 2002) and with
their lengths matched to those of critical word pairs. The
Chinese nonwords were all made up of two characters and
their stroke numbers were matched to Chinese words in
critical material.
In each experimental section, one of the four versions of
the critical experiment material (64 pairs) was presented to a
participant, along with the 160 common unrelated fillers and
word-nonword pairs, which yielded a total of 224
experiment trials and a relatedness proportion (RP) of .25
and a nonword ratio (NR) of .50.3 We set up the values of
these two important parameters following the guideline
“low RP” and “neutral NR” from McNamara (2005, p.72) to
reduce the chance that participants would develop top-down
strategies (e.g., expectancy) during the experiment.

Complexity, Word Length and Frequency All Chinese
words in the critical word pairs were two-character words,
and their complexity was based on the number of strokes of
the two characters combined. The length of an English word
was calculated as its phoneme number. For the SR and SU
conditions, Chinese words had an average stroke number of
13.03 (SD=3.41), and English words on average consisted
of 4.63 phonemes (SD=1.18). For the TR and TU
conditions, Chinese words had an average of 14.69 strokes
(SD=4.64) while English word length was 4.63 (SD =1.36).
Word length and character complexity are not the same, but
they are intended as rough measures of the surface
properties of materials in the experiment.
The frequencies of English words were derived from the
WebCELEX database (http://celex.mpi.nl/), and Chinese
words’ frequencies were derived from MCRC corpus
(Modern Chinese Research Corpus; Sun et al., 1996), which
is an electronic collection of text material from modern
Chinese media. The unit for word frequency was “times per
million”. For the SR and SU conditions, the mean frequency
of Chinese words was 32.98 (SD=34.46) while that of
English words was 40.38 (SD=40.68). For the TR and TU
conditions, the mean word frequency was 32.34 (SD=31.70)
for Chinese and 41.28 (SD=32.82) for English. Overall,
there was no significant difference between Chinese and
English (t(126)=1.33, p=.19) in word frequency.

Procedure
The experimental material from different categories
mentioned above were first mixed and then blocked by
language (English vs. Chinese as target words). Half of the
participants were presented with the Chinese target block
first and the other half were presented with the English
target block first. All the participants were tested
individually in a psychology experiment room either at
BNU, Beijing, China or at Emmanuel College, Boston, USA.
Participants were first asked to finish the lexical decision
experiment, and then completed the Language history
questionnaire and the CPVT test (see participant section).
The entire experiment session lasted about 50 minutes. All
the experiment instructions were given in Chinese.
The stimulus presentation and response registration were
controlled by DMDX (Forster & Forster, 2003) run on
desktop computers with Windows XP as the operating
system. The computers’ screen resolution was set to be
1024x768 with 16-bit color depth and a refresh rate of 60Hz.
Stimulus words were always presented in black color on a
white background. English words were all presented on
lowercase letters and the font size for all primes and targets
was 36 point. In each experimental trial, first a blank screen
was shown to participants for 1000 milliseconds, followed
by a fixation sign “+” that appeared for 500ms in the center
of the screen, which reminded the participants that a trial
was about to start. Then a prime word appeared for 150ms
and was then immediately replaced by the target.
Participants needed to make a lexical decision on the target

Semantic Relatedness To evaluate the validity of the
critical material we created, we asked a separate group of 14
undergraduate students from BNU to rate the level of
semantic relatedness of the critical word pairs on a 6-point
scale (with 1 indicating that the two words were not related
at all to 6 for being identical in meaning). The mean
relatedness of word pairs in the TR group was 5.84
(SD=0.17), which was significantly higher than that for TU
group (M=1.46, SD=0.36), revealed by a paired samples ttest (t(31)=63.38, p<.001). Similarly, the difference between
the SR group (M=4.38, SD=0.29) and the SU group
(M=1.51, SD= 0.30) was significant (t(31)=39.30, p< .001).
We also checked the reliability of our critical stimuli
according to a free association norm from the University of
South Florida (Nelson, McEvoy, & Schreiber, 1998). We
found that our semantically related word pairs have average
association strength of 0.192 and no two words in an
unrelated pair can be associated with each other based on
the norm2. This result is in consistent with the ratings by the
14 BNU students as discussed above.

According to the definition of McNamara (2005, p. 68), RP is
defined as the proportion of related trials (32 here) out of all word
prime-word target trials (128 here); NR is the conditional
probability that the target is a nonword (96 here) given that the
prime and the target are unrelated (192 here).

The association strength indicates how many percents of the
participants of the USF Norm rated two particular words in a word
pair as associated.

(Yes/No) by pressing the “j” key or the “f” key respectively.
The participants were told to respond as quickly and as
accurately as possible. The target remained on the screen for
2500ms or until the participants responded, followed by a
new trial. Participants’ response and reaction time for each
target word were collected. In addition to the 224
experiment trials, there were 10 practice trials at the
beginning of the experiment for participants to get familiar
with the procedure.
Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) SOA indicates the
time interval between the onset of the prime words and the
onset of the target. It is widely accepted that short SOA can
prevent participants developing top-down strategies (like
expectancies from primes) in a priming experiment. Given
our interest in implicit automatic processing of two
languages, the SOA of our experiment was set to be 150ms,
a number widely accepted as a short SOA in previous
literature (McNamara, 2005, p.72; Altarriba & BasnightBrown, 2007).

Results
Reaction Times
Only the critical word pairs (excluding fillers and nonwords)
entered into our statistical analysis. Among them, 2.81%
were incorrect responses, therefore discarded. In addition,
outliers were trimmed from the data by removing responses
more than 2.5 standard deviations below or above each
participant’s mean (accounting for 3% of the total
responses). Such procedure of trimming has been a common
practice in the priming literature (Zeelenberg & Pecher,
2003).
ANOVA A participant-based 3x2x2x2 mixed-design
ANOVA was conducted on the reaction time (in
milliseconds), with Group as the between-subject factor,
and Direction (English vs. Chinese as targets), Prime Type
(translation vs. semantic) and Relatedness (related vs.
unrelated) as the within-subject factors 4. Significant main
effects were found for all the four factors. For Direction,
F(1,57)=46.48, p < .001, and partial η2=.45, suggesting that
overall our participants responded significantly faster to L1
targets (Chinese: 578.96ms) than to L2 targets (English:
647.28ms). For Prime Type, F(1,57)=17.56, p < .001, and
partial η2=.24, showing that overall our bilinguals
recognized targets in the translation group (605.09ms) faster
than those in the semantic group (621.16ms). Regarding the
variable Relatedness, F(1,57)= 76.40, p<.001, and partial

faster in responding to the related word pairs than to
unrelated pairs (594.41ms vs. 631.84ms; i.e., a priming
effect). Finally, for Group: F(2,57)=10.48, p < .001, and
partial η2=.27, indicating the three groups had significant
different mean reaction times, in particular, the BNU high
proficiency group had the shortest mean RT (550.62ms)
significantly different from the low proficiency group
(619.59ms) and the high proficiency group with study
abroad experience (669.16ms).
Significant interactions were also observed in our data.
For example, the interaction between Direction and
Relatedness had an F(1,57)= 39.88, p<.001, and partial
η2=.41. This interaction effect shows that the magnitudes of
priming effects were not equal for the L1-L2 and L2-L1
directions. The priming from L1 to L2 was significant
(p<.001) and larger (+67.19ms) than the marginally
significant priming effect from L2 to L1 (+7.68ms, p
=.084).
The interaction between Type and Relatedness had an
F(1,56)= 8.67, p = .005, and partial η2=.13. The follow-up
comparisons clearly showed that the magnitudes of
translation priming effect (+52.02ms) was larger than the
semantic priming effect (+22.85ms), though both priming
effects were significant (p<.001 and p=.002 respectively).
There was also a significant 3-way interaction among
Direction, Type and Relatedness, F(1,56)=5.83, p=.019, and
partial η2=.09. This finding is important since the follow-up
comparisons revealed that, combining the three groups, both
translation and semantic priming were not significant from
the L2 to L1 (English to Chinese) direction (+12.04ms,
p=.058 and +3.32ms, p=.68 respectively), but significant
from the L1 to L2 direction (+92.00ms for translation
priming and +42.37ms for semantic priming, both p <.001).
This revealed a clear “priming asymmetry”.
Planned Comparisons We also conducted a series of
planned comparisons (paired-samples t-tests) to study
individual priming effects across different situations (See
Table 2). For the low proficiency group at BNU, there were
significant translation-priming effects of +106.07 ms from
Chinese (L1) primes to English (L2) targets (t(24)= 6.03,
p<.001) but not from L2 to L1 (+6.76ms; t(24)= 0.63,
p=.532). There were also significant semantic priming
effects of +37.32 ms from L1 primes to L2 targets (t(24)=
2.29, p=.031) but not from L2 to L1 (-0.33ms; t(24)= 0.03,
p=.976).
For the high proficiency group from BNU who had not
study abroad experience, there were significant translation
priming effects of +74.03 ms from the direction of L1 to L2
(t(18)= 6.11, p<.001) but only marginally significant
translation priming from L2 to L1 (+17.53ms; t(18)= 1.70,
p=.106). Similarly, there were significant semantic priming
effects of +28.05 ms from L1 to L2 (t(18)= 2.62, p=.017)
but not from L2 to L1 (1.76 ms; t(18)= 0.116, p=.909).
Interestingly, for the high proficiency group who had study
abroad experience (in Boston), there were significant

Many investigators prefer to report the results from both
participant-based and item-based ANOVAs for priming data, but
we agree with McNarama (2005, p. 57) that items should not be
treated as a random variable given they are often carefully selected
and organized by the investigators. Therefore only participantbased results are reported here (an item-based ANOVA did reveal
similar patterns on our data).

from L1 to L2, t(15)= 4.02, p=.001; and +25.35ms from L2

semantic priming effects of +61.75 ms from L1 to L2
(t(15)= 2.22, p=.043) but not from L2 to L1 (7.87 ms; t(15)=
0.50, p=.623).

Partial Correlations We also computed the partial
correlations between the four priming effects and the CPVT
scores with participants’ average RT controlled. The results
showed that there was a significant positive correlation
between CPVT scores and translation priming effect from
L2 to L1 (r(57)=.32, p=.014), but no correlations were
found between CPVT and other three priming effects. This
result is consistent with the data shown in Table 2 in that
participants’ translation priming from L2 to L1 increases as
their L2 proficiency level increases while the priming from
L1 to L2 stays on a stable level.
From Table 2 and above analyses, we can find a clear
“priming asymmetry” across all the groups. In addition, it
seems that the magnitude of this asymmetry gradually
decreases as bilinguals’ knowledge and experience of their
L2 increases, particularly in terms of the asymmetry of the
translation priming effects between L1 to L2 and L2 to L1.
The magnitude of the semantic priming from L2 to L1 also
increased slightly to 7.87ms for the high proficiency group
who had study abroad experience, although this was not
statistically significant.

Error Rate
Our critical word pairs contained only 2.81% of responses
that were incorrect. Therefore the error rate was not the
main target of our study. Nevertheless an ANOVA was
applied to the error rate data, which revealed that
participants tended to make more errors on English (L2)
targets than Chinese (L1) targets (2.88% vs. 1.42%, F(1,57)
= 6.22, p =.016). In addition, a significant main effect on
relatedness (F(1,57) = 8.09, p =.006) indicated that fewer
errors were made on related word pairs than unrelated word
pairs (1.49% vs. 2.81%). No main effects on Prime Type
and Group were found.

In this study we have found both translation and semantic
priming effects across languages, and also observed a
number of patterns consistent with previous findings, such
as “priming asymmetry” and the stronger facilitation for
translation priming than semantic priming. More
interestingly, considering a developmental perspective, we
observed a pattern of increasing priming effects from L2 to
L1, which mirrors a decrement of the levels of priming
asymmetry, as bilinguals’ L2 proficiency and experience
increases.
Several theoretical frameworks of bilingual mental
lexicon have been proposed, including the Revised
Hierarchical Model (RHM, Kroll & Stewart, 1994), and
more recently, the Sense model (Finkbeiner, et al, 2004), to
account for bilingual lexical representation and processing.
Our data are in general consistent with the RHM model in
that increasing L2 to L1 priming suggests stronger lexical to
semantic/conceptual links as L2 proficiency increases. Few
computational models, however, have been proposed to
account for the underlying mechanisms in bilingual lexical
processing. Recently, we introduced a neural network
model, DevLex-II, to study how bilingual mental
representations of two languages can emerge, develop, and
interact with each other as a function of the learning history
(see details in Zhao & Li, 2010). The results from our
simulations suggest that the representational structure is
highly dependent on the onset time of L2 learning. L2
representation becomes “parasitic” on the representation of
L1 when the learning of L2 occurs late; in particular,
comparing
with
large
and
well-organized
L1
representations, L2 lexical representations were dispersed
and fragmented on the semantic map of our model (See
Figure 2 in Zhao & Li, 2010). L2 words were often densely
distributed in small chunks, and their locations depended on
how similar they were to the L1 words in meaning.
One possible source of the discussed cross-languages
priming patterns, based on Zhao and Li’s (2010) simulation
results, could be due to the nature of the L2 representation
in late bilinguals’ mental space. L2 words are often
projected close to their translation equivalents, thus also
close to the L1 words which are semantically related. Such
close distribution in semantic representation allows
spreading activation to occur more easily from words in one
language to their semantically-related words in the other
language, which in turn causes the cross-language priming
effects. Since there is more overlap in meaning between
translation equivalents than between semantically related
words, translation priming is often larger than semantic
priming.
Regarding the “priming asymmetry” along different
priming directions, there might be two interrelated sources.
On the one hand, lexical items in L2 are represented in more
dense neighborhoods and hence in a more confusable

as primes, a very brief exposure to them may not trigger
activations strong enough to spread to the target L1 items
not directly adjacent in mental representation. In contrast,
activations of L1 items could be stronger given that they are
more sparsely represented (thus having less competition).
On the other hand, the dispersed and fragmented L2
representations imply that late bilingual’s mental
representation of L2 words may be relatively
“impoverished” (i.e. bilinguals are aware of fewer features
and semantic associations of words) in contrast to the better
organization and richer relations of L1 items. In addition,
bilingual’s knowledge of an L2 word relies heavily
(“parasitic”) on their understanding of those features shared
with its L1 equivalent. Therefore, when a L1 word serves as
a prime, all the features and associations that the word lends
to its L2 equivalent get activated, therefore causing the L2
equivalent easier to be recognized if it is a target.
When late bilinguals’ L2 knowledge and proficiency
gradually increase, their mental representations of L2 will
become less dense and more organized. In other words, less
confusion and better organization of semantic associations
for L2 will occur. Such changes may cause the priming
effects from L2 to L1 stronger and the “priming
asymmetry” less salient as found in our experiment.
Finally, age of acquisition (AoA) is a very important
factor in bilinguals’ second language development, and how
AoA and proficiency individually or jointly affect language
representation and processing has been a matter of recent
debate (see Hernanderz & Li 2007 for a review). It is worth
noting that all of our participants are late bilinguals (with an
average starting age of learning L2 around 11 years old), but
they have different levels of proficiency. Our previous
simulations of early versus late L2 learning showed the
development of different patterns of representations for the
two lexicons. To what extent these distinct patterns can be
generalized to different proficiency levels remains to be
investigated. Some of our preliminary simulations suggest
that lateral connections between semantic representations
within the same map/network may serve to model spreading
activation for bilinguals (Zhao & Li, 2009).
