Abstract
Two experiments explore the effects of mood on category
learning. In the first experiment subjects were put into either a
negative or a neutral mood before completing one of two
category-learning tasks. Negative mood briefly impaired rulebased category learning but this impairment did not persist
throughout the task. Negative mood did not influence nonrule-based learning. In a second study subjects learned one of
three category sets (easy rule-based, hard rule-based, nonrule-based) by Shepard, Hovland & Jenkins (1961) and
completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). A
significant negative correlation was found between hard rulebased performance and subject scores on the BDI-II. No
significant correlations were found between subject scores on
the BDI-II and easy rule-based or non-rule-based
performance. These results suggest that negative affect does
not significantly impair category learning but the absence of
positive affect (as measured by the BDI-II) is negatively
related to complex rule use.
Keywords: Negative affect; category learning; multiple
systems; rule use.

Introduction
The COmpetition between Verbal and Implicit Systems
(COVIS) theory of category learning posits the existence of
at least two separate but competing systems (Ashby,
Alfonso-Reese, Turken & Waldron, 1998). The first is the
explicit system, which is used to solve verbalizable/rulebased category sets. The second is the implicit system,
which is used to solve category sets for which there is no
easily verbalizable rule (such as family resemblance
categories). Learning in the second system takes longer and
involves the association of a category response (A or B)
with a stimulus via a dopamine mediated reward signal
involving the tail of the caudate nucleus. In contrast, the
explicit system can learn quickly and involves the
formulation, selection and execution of rules. The prefrontal
cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are
theorized to be involved with this system, and dopamine is
also important in this system.
The COVIS theory hypothesizes that subjects
experiencing a reduction of dopamine in the ACC should be
impaired on explicit rule-based tasks. Conversely, subjects
experiencing an increase of dopamine should experience
enhanced learning in explicit rule-based tasks. Ashby, Isen,
and Turken (1999) hypothesized that positive affect is

associated with increased dopamine levels in the brain,
specifically in the same areas implicated by COVIS in the
explicit category learning system. Therefore positive affect
should be associated with enhanced rule-based category
learning. This prediction was tested recently by Nadler,
Rabi, and Minda (2010), who found that subjects in a
positive mood displayed better overall rule-based category
learning performance compared to a neutral mood group.
Predictions about negative affect are less straightforward,
as noted by Ashby et al. (1999). Negative affect has not
been proven to be the simple converse of positive affect.
Isen, Daubman, and Nowicki (1987) reported that positive
affect subjects performed better than neutral affect subjects
on a problem-solving task. However negative affect subjects
did not differ from neutral affect subjects. In a review of the
evidence, Isen (1987) describes the effects of positive and
negative affect as independent and nonsymmetrical as
opposed to inverse or similar. Despite these findings, the
idea that negative affect should impair cognition at least
some of the time persists.
Nadler et al. (2010) also compared a negative affect group
with a neutral affect group, and reported that negative mood
did not impair overall performance on rule-based or nonrule-based category learning. However by focusing on
overall performance across 320 trials, it is possible that
more subtle effects of negative mood were missed.
Experiment 1 presents a reanalysis of the Nadler et al.
(2010) negative mood data to explore the influence of
negative affect on category learning in greater depth.

Study 1
Method
Subjects 56 undergraduates from the University of Western
Ontario participated for pay, 28 in the negative mood
condition and 28 in the neutral mood condition.
Materials Youtube clips. Music and video clips taken from
the video website YouTube (http://www.youtube.com) were
used to manipulate mood states. For the negative mood
condition subjects listened to the soundtrack from the movie
“Schindler’s List”, and then watched footage of the 2008
Chinese Earthquake. Subjects in the neutral mood condition
listened to a piece of music called “One Angel’s Hands” by
Mark Salona and then watched footage from the television-

Results
PANAS The averaged scores on the Negative Affect scale
of the PANAS were 1.18 for the neutral condition and 2.13
for the negative condition, and this difference was
significant, F (1,55) = 31.75, p < .001, n2 = .366, with
negative mood subjects reporting significantly more
negative affect than neutral affect subjects.
Category learning When performance across all 320
trials of the rule-based learning task was compared, no
significant differences were found between neutral (M=.73)
and negative (M=.73) mood conditions, F (1, 27) = 0.18, p =
.67. The 320 category learning trials were divided into 20
trial increments to see if subtle negative mood impairments
could be found, but out of 16 20-trial blocks (shown above
in Figure 2), there was only 1 block where there appeared to
be a significant difference between neutral and negative
conditions (Block 4).
Non-rule-based performance did not differ between
neutral (M = .66) and negative (M = .64) mood conditions, F
(1, 27) = 0.63, p = .43.
Computational Modeling The response strategies of our
subjects were investigated using decision-bound models (for
more information see Ashby, 1992a; Maddox & Ashby,
1993). One class of model assumed that the performance of
each subject was based on a single-dimensional rule (the
optimal version of this class used a fixed intercept, while the
other allowed the intercept to vary). A second class assumed
that the performance of each subject was based on a twodimensional non-rule-described boundary (an optimal
version with a fixed slope and intercept, a version with a
fixed slope, and a version with a slope and intercept that
were free to vary). The models were fit to each subject’s
performance data by maximizing the log likelihood. Models
were compared by using Akaike’s information criterion
(Ashby, 1992b).
When the optimal rule-based model fit was compared
across all 320 trials of rule-based category learning, there
was no difference between the neutral (M = .75) and
negative (M = .75) conditions. The optimal model fits by
80-trial block are shown below in Figure 3.

show “Antiques Roadshow”. Clip selections were based on
a pilot study where 7 graduate students rated a series of clips
in terms of how the clips made them feel using a 7-point
scale, which ranged from 1 (very sad) to 4 (neutral) to 7
(very happy). The clips rated as most sad and most neutral
were used in the current experiment.
Mood scale. The Positive And Negative Affect Schedule
(PANAS) assesses positive and negative affect dimensions
(Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1987), and was used to assess
subjects’ mood after exposure to the music and video clips.
Category sets. Gabor patches were created using established
methodologies (see Ashby & Gott, 1988; Zeithamova &
Maddox, 2006). For each category set (rule-based and nonrule-based), 40 values from a multivariate normal
distribution were randomly sampled. The resulting
structures for the category sets are illustrated in Figure 1.
The PsychoPy software package (Pierce, 2007) was used to
generate Gabor patches corresponding to each coordinate
sampled from the multivariate distributions.
Procedure Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two
mood-induction conditions (neutral or negative), as well as
to one of the two category sets (rule-based or non-rulebased). Subjects were presented with the YouTube clips
from their respective condition, listening to the music clips
first and then the video clips. Following exposure to the
clips subjects completed the PANAS to assess their
affective state.
After receiving instructions subjects completed the
category-learning task on the computer. On each trial a
Gabor patch (made to look like a crystal ball) was presented
in the centre of the screen, and subjects pressed the “A” or
the “B” key to classify the stimulus. Feedback “CORRECT”
or “INCORRECT” was given after each trial. Subjects
completed four blocks of 80 trials for a total of 320 trials.
The presentation order of the stimuli was randomly
generated within each block for each subject.
Upon completion of the 320 trials, subjects were asked if
they had any questions and debriefed. Subjects in the
negative mood condition were exposed to a happy video clip
before leaving the experiment so that they were not in a
negative mood upon leaving the experiment.

Frequency

The current experiment sought to explore the effects of
negative mood on category learning. While overall
performance between negative and neutral mood conditions
did not differ, negative affect subjects briefly performed
more poorly than neutral affect subjects. However this
worsened performance was transient and did not persist
throughout learning. Computational modeling did not reveal
any major differences between the conditions. Overall
negative affect subjects could not be distinguished from
neutral affect subjects.

Only one study has previously explored this idea. Smith,
Tracy, and Murray (1993) compared a group of adults who
were classified as severely depressed with age-matched
controls on two kinds of category sets. The first category set
required subjects to find a verbalizable rule to achieve
perfect performance. The second category set could be
learned using overall similarity/family resemblance, and
thus did not require verbal rule use. Depressed subjects were
found to be impaired on rule-based but not non-rule-based
category learning.
Experiment 2 is a correlational study that correlated a
depression scale with performance on one of three category
sets, two of which are rule-based and one of which is nonrule-based. We expected to find a relationship between
reported depression symptoms and rule-based category
learning, in line with past research by Smith et al. (1993), as
well as the COVIS model.

Method
Subjects 80 university undergraduates from the University
of Western Ontario participated either for pay or for course

credit, with 23 subjects in the easy rule-based condition
(ERB), 27 subjects in the hard rule-based condition (HRB),
and 30 subjects in the non-rule-based condition (NRB).
Materials The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck,
Steer, & Brown, 1996) is made up of 21 groups of
statements that assess the features of major depression (e.g.
sadness, loss of pleasure, changes in sleep, etc.). Subjects
are asked to think about how they have felt for the last two
weeks when responding.
Category sets. Three category sets designed by Shepard,
Hovland, and Jenkins (1961) were used. In each category set
there are 3 features (shape, size, colour) that can have one of
two dimensions (square or triangle, large or small, orange or
blue). In the first category set (easy rule-based/Type I), only
one feature is used to indicate category membership,
subjects can achieve perfect performance using a singledimensional verbal rule. In the second category set used
(hard rule-based/Type II), more than one feature is used to
indicate category membership, subjects can achieve perfect
performance using a disjunctive verbal rule (i.e. dark
triangles and light squares in one category, light triangles
and dark squares in another category). In the third category
set used (non-rule-based/Type IV), more than one feature is
used to indicate category membership and subjects can
achieve perfect performance by learning that the stimuli in
each category share family resemblance. These category
sets are shown in Figure 4.
Procedure Upon agreeing to participate, subjects completed
the depression questionnaire using paper and pencil.
Subjects were then randomly assigned to one of the three
category learning conditions (easy rule-based, hard rulebased, and non-rule-based) and completed 80 trials of the
task on a computer. Subjects saw each stimulus on a
computer screen and were instructed to press the “0” or the
“1” key to indicate that the shape belonged in the forest or
the mountains respectively. After responding, subjects were
given feedback: the shape would smile and move towards
the correct location on the screen to indicate a correct
response, or the shape would frown and move half-way
towards the incorrect location and then smile and move to
the correct location to indicate an incorrect response.
Another trial began once feedback was received. Stimuli
were presented in a random order within each block of 8
stimuli and blocks were presented in an unbroken fashion.

Results
BDI-II Scores The BDI-II groups subjects into 4 groups:
minimal depression (0-13), mild depression (14-19),
moderate depression (20-28), and severe depression (29-63).
The majority (N=59) of our subjects scored within the
minimal depression range, 11 scored within the mild
depression range, 6 in the moderate range, and 3 subjects
scored in the severe depression range. As this was a
between-subjects experiment, the depression scores of
subjects is divided by category set completed in Table 1.

Category Learning Performance Subjects performed 10
blocks (80 trials) of one of the three category sets. The
averaged performance of subjects who learned the easy rulebased category set was M = 85.63, sd = 16.70. The averaged
performance of subjects who learned hard rule-based
category set was M = 68.08, sd = 15.59. The averaged
performance of subjects who learned the non-rule-based
category set was M = 67.92, sd = 13.56. The learning curve
of all three category types across 80 trials (10 blocks) of
learning is shown in Figure 5.
Correlational Analyses Pearson, 2-tailed correlational
analyses were performed between subjects averaged
performance across all ten blocks of category learning
performance and the BDI-II. There were no significant
correlations between subject scores on the BDI-II and easy
rule-based or non-rule-based category learning (p > .05 for
both). There was a significant negative correlation between
hard-rule-based performance and BDI-II score r = -.541, p <
.01. A scatter plot showing subject’s overall performance
and BDI-II responding on Type II category learning is
shown in Figure 6.

Non-rule-based

The current experiment explored the relationship between
rule-based and non-rule-based category learning and a
measure of depression symptoms. Although both easy rulebased/Type I and hard rule-based/Type II category sets are
learned by with a verbal rule using the explicit system, the
hard rule-based category set involves the learning of a
complicated, disjunctive rule while easy rule-based set
involves the learning of a simple, one-dimensional rule. In
contrast, the non-rule-based category set can be learned
nonverbally, by the implicit system. We predicted that
subjects who scored higher on the BDI-II would be:
unimpaired on easy rule-based learning, impaired on hard
rule-based learning, and unimpaired on non-rule-based
learning. This is because depressive symptoms should be
related to the verbal category learning system but not to the
extent that subjects cannot learn a simple verbal rule,
however a more complex verbal rule should prove
problematic for subjects who scored higher on the BDI-II.
Since the brain areas implicated in the nonverbal system are
theorized to not be influenced by changes in dopamine in
frontal brain regions, we predicted that there would be no
correlation between performance on this task and BDI-II
score.
As predicted, there was a negative relationship between
BDI-II score and hard rule-based category learning
performance, but no relationship between BDI-II score and
easy rule-based, or non-rule-based performance. Previous
work by Smith et al. (1993) showed that subjects
experiencing major depression were impaired on criterial
attribute (rule-based) category learning but unimpaired on
family resemblance (non-rule-based) category learning.
While the present findings seem to fit with this research, it
must be noted that we did not have as many subjects in our
experiment who could be categorized as having major
depression, preventing clear comparisons from being made.
A limitation of this work is that the study is correlational,
so no causal conclusions can be drawn. A further limitation
is that the majority of our subjects were not clinically
depressed. However this work indicates that individual
differences in the degree of depressive symptoms are related
to complex rule-based category learning performance.

Experiment 1 did not find that negative affect consistently
impairs category-learning performance; indeed only a single
instance of significant impairment was found when learning
was examined in detail. These results warrant replication
and further investigation. Future work should utilize
different methods of inducing negative affect as well as
methods of sustaining negative affect throughout the
experiment.
Experiment 2 offers some interesting links between
depression symptoms and category learning performance.
Although the conclusions that can be drawn from this study
are limited, it appears that depressive symptoms are related
to complex rule-based category learning even when subjects

1761

do not meet the criteria for major/clinical depression. These
findings are in line with the work of Smith et al. (1993) and
represent a first attempt to revivify the study of depression
and category learning. Future research should extend this
work by comparing the category learning performance of
depressed and non-depressed subjects on a wider variety of
category sets.
The research presented suggests that depressive
symptoms may be related to performance on rule-based
category learning tasks that are moderately difficult, while
negative affect may not impair either rule-based or non-rulebased category learning. Both experiments require
replication and extensions, but we think this work is a step
towards systematically demonstrating that depressive
symptoms, not negative affect, influence the explicit
category learning system.
