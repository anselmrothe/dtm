Abstract: Musical experience has been found to improve language (SchoÌˆn, et al., 2007) and literacy skills (Anvari,
et al., 2002). Here, we consider whether musical experience contributes to an important component of language
learning, namely segmentation of novel sound sequences. Participants with varying degrees of musical experience
were exposed to two statistically-defined languages, one consisting of Morse-code sequences and one of pure-tone
sequences. In addition, conflicting cues were introduced to determine which auditory features musicians use when
learning a novel language. Results show that participants with a higher degree of musical experience were more likely
to learn Morse- and tone-based words, and those that learned did so primarily via temporal information. Effective
temporal processing is likely to be useful in natural language learning (e.g., acquisition of voice-onset time and vowel
length discriminations). We conclude that the mechanisms that underlie successful musical processing may also play
a key role in language learning.
