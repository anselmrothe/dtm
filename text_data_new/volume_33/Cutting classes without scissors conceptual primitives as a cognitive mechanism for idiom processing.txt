Abstract: What does it tell us about the conceptual structures underlying language use that a language can use
”prick the law” but not ”sing the law” to mean ”break the law”? Some theorists have speculated about the existence
of conceptual primitives, which permeate the meaning of all words in any language (Schank, 1975, Mandler, 2004). If
this premise is correct, then these concepts could also be used to decode metaphorical or idiomatic speech. The present
research investigates whether people use the same concepts behind the literal verb meaning to infer the meaning
of an idiomatic one. We investigated native-English speakers’ understanding of idioms in an unfamiliar language,
i.e. Brazilian-Portuguese, and their understanding of fabricated idiomatic expressions that use words whose likely
primitives conflict with the meaning of the idiom (e.g., ”sing the law” to mean ”break the law”). Results of this
study reveal new insights for the theory of conceptual primitives.
