on general attentional mechanism—have generated a large
number of empirical findings, often pitting postulated
knowledge against statistical contingencies (e.g., Kuhl,
2000). However, neither of them can fully account for the
existing data, as we explain next.
Knowledge-rich approaches—those that attribute
meaningful performance to mental structures of some sort—
fall short when performance changes as a function of
miniscule changes in the task context. For example, how
could a knowledge-based account explain that the A-not-B
error disappears when the infant‘s posture is briefly changed
prior to a B trial (e.g., Smith & Thelen, 2003)? Or how
could it explain that toddlers pay attention to the solidity of
objects when the object is fully visible, but not when it is
hidden (e.g., Keen, 2003)? Of course one could always
postulate a new representation, schema, or belief for each
unique performance. Children might have implicit
knowledge of solidity, for example, but lack explicit
knowledge of this concept. However, this solution is neither
parsimonious nor predictive and testable.
On the other hand, knowledge-lean approaches—those
that attribute meaningful performance to the mind‘s ability
to extract statistical regularities—fall short in cases in which
children blatantly ignore even the most straight-forward
evidence. In particular, children appear blind to statistical
contingencies when they have an expectation that conflicts
with the statistical contingencies. For example, both
children and adults sometimes mistakenly expect two
variables to be correlated, leading to the phenomenon of
illusory correlations (e.g., Chapman & Chapman, 1969). Or
children fail to learn how two variables correlate if that
correlation does not match with their larger frame of
references (e.g., Kloos, 2007).
The current approach takes a step back and acknowledges
that performance is based on both a child‘s specific
expectations and a child‘s general ability to track statistical
contingencies. In fact, there might be much more that
matters in the immediate task context, including a child‘s
idiosyncratic history and readiness, details of the verbal

Abstract
When presented with a problem-solving task, children
sometimes fail to discern relevant pieces of information.
Instead, they base their judgment on irrelevant information,
sometimes ignoring corrective feedback. How could
experience highlight relevant information? Using insights
from complexity science, the current paper tests the
usefulness of adding instability, or noise, to a child‘s
experience. The idea is that an appropriate amount of
instability flattens the attractor space of mistaken
performance, allowing children to explore aspects of the
environment perhaps considered irrelevant. To test this idea,
we asked children between 4 and 9 years of age to place
beams on a fulcrum where they would balance. Instability
was conceptualized using beams for which the weight
distribution was difficult to discern. While 4- to 5-year-olds
and adults were unaffected by the noise manipulation,
possibly for different reasons, 7- to 9-year-olds balanced the
beams better when instability was at an intermediate level.

Introduction
How does a child know what to pay attention to? For
example, how does a child know that a new word pertains to
the overall shape of an object rather than the color of it, or
the shape of some part of it? Or how does a child know that
two events are causally related? Answers to such questions
fall in one of two categories: (1) they assume that specific
top-down knowledge allows the child to sort messy
variation into relevant and irrelevant information1, or (2)
they assume that general attentional processes allow the
child to decipher rich statistical data2. Both types of
approaches—the focus on specific knowledge, or the focus

instructions, and apparently irrelevant arrangements of the
task materials. One could conceive of these factors as
aligning themselves in a ratio of constraints that make up
the attractor space of performance (cf., e.g., Spivey & Dale,
2004). In this terminology, consistent performance—such as
doing the same thing even as the external circumstances
change—reflects a deep attractor well. And inconsistent
performance, even when the task context stays the same,
reflects several very shallow attractor spaces that are easily
traded for each other.
There is one main advantage of the attractor approach:
questions about the relative contribution of an individual
factor—say, the contribution of a specific representation,
belief, or strategy—become superfluous. If all of the
relevant factors align themselves in an interdependent
network of constraints, the unique contribution of a single
factor cannot be determined empirically (cf., Guastello &
Guastello, 1998). Postulating an attractor approach allows
us instead to investigate the degree to which changes to the
attractor space lead to a successful change in performance.
We explore one specific perturbation to the attractor space:
namely, to flatten the attractor space by adding noise into
task context.
Noise is defined as any form of inconsistency or variation
in seemingly irrelevant features of the task. Intuitively, such
noise is considered to have negative effects on learning: it
might hinder a child‘s ability to pick up on relevant
variations. However, there are some findings that
demonstrate the benefit of noise (e.g., Gentner, Loewenstein
& Hung, 2007; Green Hall & Magill, 1995). Most notable is
a recent finding with a gear task (Stephen, Dixon, &
Isenhower, in press). Adults and children had to predict the
turning direction of the last gear in a chain, upon knowing
the turning direction of the first gear in that chain. Children
and adults alike arrived at a more sophisticated solution of
the task quicker when the task context featured more noise.
In particular, when the chain was moved randomly across
the computer screen (vs. standing still), participants more
readily switched from tracing each gear individually to
paying attention to the parity of the gears. The argument is
that the noise, and the resulting instability in the participanttask system, might make available otherwise unnoticed
contingencies.
The goal of the current study is to extend this rather nonintuitive finding to a new task domain and a new noise
manipulation. Children and adults were asked to balance
beams on a fulcrum such that the beam would not tip. This
task has rich statistical contingencies (e.g., moment-tomoment haptic feedback) and, at the same time, it is likely
to elicit children‘s prior beliefs (e.g., that beams balance at
their geometric middle, and not at its center of mass;
Karmiloff-Smith & Inhelder, 1975; Bonawitz, 2007). As
such, this task is likely to be affected by both top-down
knowledge and by bottom-up attention to statistical
structure. Could noise help children attend to relevant
information?

Previous research involving balance beams has explored
understanding of the weight-distance relationship by
manipulating both variables (e.g., Amsel et al., 1996;
Ferretti et al., 1985; Siegler, 1976). However, as a means of
noise manipulation, we used beams of uniform length yet
with difficult-to-perceive weight distribution. Initial
calibration testing revealed that preschoolers (N = 64 4- to
5-year-olds) performed at chance when judging the weight
distribution of beams that balanced 3cm off the geometric
middle. On the other hand, their judgment was above chance
for beams that balanced at the geometric middle, as well as
for beams that balanced 6cm off the geometric middle.
Attempting to balance the 3cm-beams is therefore likely to
increase the noise in the system. Note that this noise
manipulation differs in important ways from the noise
manipulation in Stephens et al.‘s gear task: rather than being
extraneous to the task (as was the case when the gear chains
moved across the screen), our noise manipulation pertains to
the relevant task contingencies per se (the relation between
perceived weight distribution and correct balancing point).
To what extent does such noise manipulation help learning?
There were three conditions that differed in the beams
presented to participants during the initial balancing trials.
In the all-noise condition, all uneven beams balanced 3cm
off their geometric middle. In contrast, in the no-noise
condition, all uneven beams balanced 6cm off their
geometric middle. Finally in the some-noise condition, half
of the uneven beams balanced 3cm off their geometric
middle, while the other uneven beams balanced 6cm off
their geometric middle. The crucial test was during the last
session of trials, which included 3cm-beams and 6cm-beams
for all participants. Note that participants in the some-noise
condition were given less experience with 6cm-beams than
participants in the no-noise condition. This allowed us to pit
noise against relevant experience.
To determine whether our manipulation works differently
across development, two groups of children were included:
preschoolers between 4 and 5 years of age, and elementaryschool children between 7 and 9 years of age. Adults served
as control group to gauge the endpoint of development.
While preschoolers were previously found to have a strong
geometric-center belief, 7- to 9-year-olds are more likely to
ignore the geometric center and focus instead on the center
of mass (cf. Karmiloff-Smith & Inhelder, 1975). Does this
difference in balancing success make a difference in how
children learn best?

Method
Participants
Participants were 64 4- to 5-year-old preschoolers (range =
4.5 to 5.5, M = 5.0 years, 28 girls, 37 boys) and 61 7- to 9year-old elementary-school children (range = 7.1 to 9.9, M =
8.6 years, 34 girls, 27 boys3). They were recruited from

serving racially diverse working- to middle-class families.
One 4-year-old was tested but excluded from the final
sample due to lost interest. In addition, adult data were
collected from 68 undergraduate students (M = 19.9, 49
women, 19 men), in exchange for course credit. Children
and adults participated in one of the three experience
conditions (all-noise, some-noise, no-noise), yielding
approximately equal number of participants and equal
gender distribution in each condition.

Design and Procedure
Children and adults were tested individually, either in a
quiet area of their school or in the lab. The experimenter sat
across from the participant, with the fulcrum placed
lengthwise between them. In an effort to maintain
participants‘ interest in the task, a cover story was used,
conveyed through a series of slides displayed on a Dell
laptop computer. Participants were told:
We‘re going to play a game with Penny the Poodle. You think
you can help Penny the Poodle balance stuff? She brought some
silly-looking things with her, and they are hard to balance. But
here‘s the thing, Penny the Poodle does not like it when the
beams fall down. Do you think you can help Penny the Poodle
balance the beams so that they don‘t fall? I want you to pick it
up and feel it and think first, and then put it up here where you
think it won‘t fall.

Materials
Twelve balance beams were constructed, each consisting of
two wooden containers attached to the opposite ends of a
rectangular piece of plywood. The containers were
approximately 10 cm long, 4.5 cm high and 6 cm wide, and
they weighed between 100 and 450 g4. The plywood piece
supporting two containers weighed about 100 g, and was 30
cm long and 10 cm wide. The fulcrum consisted of a metal
rod (2.5 cm wide, 2.5 cm tall and 56 cm long) attached to
wooden platform (61 cm long, 7.5 cm wide). Figure 1
shows three such beams, balanced on the fulcrum, each with
a different balancing point. The 0cm-beams balanced at their
geometrical center, and thus had an even weight
distribution; the 3cm-beams balanced 3 cm away from the
beam‘s geometrical center, and the 6cm-beams balanced 6
cm away from the geometrical center. There were three
different versions for each beam type: a light version (173g,
407g, and 436g, respectively), a medium version (387g,
431g, and 530g, respectively), and a heavy version (651g,
757g, and 825g, respectively). All beams were painted
uniformly white, with no visual indication about difference
in weight distributions. The desired mass of a container was
achieved by gluing lead weights and Styrofoam inside the
containers.

3cm Beam

The experimenter then demonstrated how to lift a beam
and orient it properly, without balancing the beam on the
fulcrum. Figure 2 shows a schematic of how a beam was
supposed to be held by the participant. Testing trials started
immediately. Superlab® software (Version 2.0) was used to
determine the order of beams and record participants‘
responses. For each trial, the experimenter first handed the
beam to the participant. In the case of uneven beams, care
was taken to counterbalance the orientation of the beam
(such that the heavier side was sometimes in the right and
sometimes in the left hand of the participant). The
participant was first asked to wield the beam with two hands
to determine if one side of the beam was heavier, and, if so,
which side was heavier. Without providing any feedback,
the participant was then asked to balance the beam on the
fulcrum in such a way that it would not fall. The
experimenter recorded the initial placement of the beam
using small markings drawn surreptitiously along the height
of the plywood plank. Once the beam was placed on the
fulcrum, the participant was allowed to slide the beam from
left to right until the beam balanced. After maximally two
minutes, a new trial started (i.e., if the participant could not
balance the beam within two minutes, the trial was
terminated and the child was encouraged to ―try another
beam‖).

6cm-beams). In the all-noise condition, each of the first five
sessions included two 3cm-beams and two 0cm-beams,
resulting in ten beams of each type across the five sessions.
Conversely, in the no-noise condition, each session included
two 6cm-beams and two 0cm-beams (again resulting in ten
beams for each type across the five sessions). Finally, in the
some-noise condition, each session included one 3cm-beam,
one 6cm-beam, and two 0cm-beams per session, resulting in
ten even beams and five of each of the asymmetric beams
across the five sessions. Note that the total number of beams
during the five sessions stayed the same in all three
conditions, with half of the beams being even, and with half
of the beams being uneven. The only difference was
whether the noisy 3cm-beam was included or not. Order of
beams within a session was randomized, and each session
was followed by a short break during which participants
were told that they reached the next level in the activity.

quadratic effects of beam type, Fs > 40.9, ps < .001. Note
that mean judgments of 3cm-beams did not exceed chance
for preschoolers, t < 1.1 (all other mean judgments were
above chance, ts > 4.3). And while the difference in adults‘
judgment success between 0cm- and 3cm-beams was
marginally significant, t = 1.95, p < .08, all other pair-wise
difference to the 3cm-beams were significant.

Results
Each trial yielded two scores, one to reflect whether the
mass distribution of a beam was judged correctly (i.e.,
weight judgment), and one to reflect the initial placement of
the beam on the fulcrum (i.e., beam placement). For weight
judgments, responses were coded according to whether the
two sides of the beam were judged as equal in weight
(correct for even beams) or not equal (correct for uneven
beams). Judgment data was missing for 12 out of the 5,018
trials across participants.
For beam placement, performance was coded in terms of
the absolute distance between actual placement of the beam
and correct balancing point. Placing even beams at the
geometric center yields a placement error of 0cm, and
placing uneven beams at the geometric center yields a
placement error of 3cm and 6cm, respectively. Placement
data was missing on 14 of the 5,018 trials. Note that placing
uneven beams on the lighter side of the beam would yield a
very large error. This latter beam placement never occurred
for the 6cm-beams, and it occurred seldom for the 3cmbeam. Thus, using the absolute error is likely to inflate only
the error for even beams (when error is expected to be low
to start with), but not the error for uneven beams.
We first present a series of preliminary analyses (1) to
confirm that the weight distribution of 3cm-beams was
difficult to detect and (2) to uncover possible learning
effects during the five initial sessions. We then turn to the
main analysis of describing performance in the sixth and last
session, to assess the effect of our noise manipulation.

Figure 3: Mean proportion of correct weight judgment,
separated by beam type and age group. Error bars reflect
standard errors.
Breaking it down by session, weight judgment of 3cmbeams did not improve from the first to the last session. For
example, when comparing the combined success rate of
weight judgment in the first two sessions with that of the
combined fourth and fifth session, performance for each age
group and condition remained unchanged, ts < 1. Thus, the
weight distribution of 3cm-beams was indeed more difficult
to judge than the weight distribution of the other beams—
giving credibility of our noise manipulation.
How did placement performance change across the first
five initial sessions? Recall that all children had the same
number of even beams during the first five sessions of the
experiment. Considering only the placement error for even
beams, a session-by-age ANOVA revealed no significant
main effects of session or age, nor a significant session by
age interaction. Across sessions, mean placement error (in
cm) was very low, with M = 0.46cm for 4- to 5-year-olds, M
= 0.32cm for 7- to 9-year-olds, and M = 0.49cm for adults.
For uneven beams (3cm- and 6cm-beams), recall that
conditions differed in the kinds of beams presented during
the initial five sessions. There were no 6cm-beams in the
first five sessions of the all-noise condition, and there were
no 3cm-beams in the first five sessions of the no-noises
condition Figure 4 shows the mean placement error of these
beams across the first five sessions. A series of trend
analyses revealed that learning (i.e., improved placement
across sessions) took place only for the 6cm-beams placed
by 7- to 9-year-old and adults, F(1,38) > 24.0, ps < .001.
Note that 4- to 5-year-olds had higher overall placement
errors than 7- to 9-year-old children, who in turn had higher
overall placement errors than adults. Finally, condition did
not have a noticeable effect on placement performance

Preliminary Analyses
The first preliminary analysis pertains to whether the weight
judgment for 3cm-beams was lower than the weight
judgments of the other two beam types (0cm- and 6cmbeam). Figure 3 shows the mean proportion correct weight
judgments for each beam type, separated by age group. As
expected, judging the weight distribution of 3cm-beams was
more difficult than of the other two beam types. Repeatedmeasure ANOVAs, one for each age group, revealed large

Discussion

Our goal was to determine whether experience infused with
some instability (or noise) leads to learning. The task was to
balance beams on a fulcrum, and the crucial manipulation
was whether participants were given experience with ‗noisy‘
beams, those which had a difficult-to-perceive weight
distribution (3cm-beams). Our findings show the predicted
effect for 7- to 9-year-olds. In this age group, children who
were exposed to some of the noisy beams made fewer errors
balancing the 6cm-beams in the final testing session than
children who were either presented with only 6cm-beams
(no-noise condition) or only 3cm-beams (all-noise
condition). In fact, final balancing performance of 6cmbeam in these latter conditions did not differ from each
other. This suggests that placement error of 6cm-beams was
high, whether children had a lot of experience with 6cmbeams or none at all. Placement error only decreased when
children were exposed to some 3cm-beams.
Note that participants started out with a similar degree of
placement errors, independently of condition. Second, there
was no effect of condition on children‘s placement of 3cmbeams during the final session of trials. Therefore, the effect
of condition on the placement of 6cm-beams in the final
session of trials cannot be attributed to differences in initial
competence or differences in overall improvement. Instead,
results suggest that the moderate amount of noise,
introduced by the 3cm-beams, highlighted relevant
information in the task. Put another way, the moderate
amount of noise might have flattened the attractor of the
belief that visually symmetrical beams balance at their
geometric center, allowing children to explore the less
salient haptic information of weight distribution.
Why did our manipulation fail to affect preschoolers and
adults? For adults, the issue might be a ceiling/floor effect:
balancing performance of 6cm-beams might have been too

during the initial five sessions: For example, whether
performing in the all-noise condition or the some-noise
condition, 4- to 5-year-olds placed most of the 3cm-beams
between two and three cm off the correct balancing point.

uneven beams across the five training sessions.

Main Analysis
For the main analysis, we looked at participants‘ placement
of the beams during the last testing session: when the task
was to balance three 3cm-beams and three 6cm- beams. The
main question pertains to whether our noise manipulation
affected the placement error of 6cm-beams. Figure 5 shows
the mean absolute error for this beam type during the last
session.
One-factor ANOVAs, one for each age group, revealed a
quadratic effect of condition for 7- to 9-year-olds, F(2, 58) =
3.2, p < .05 (see red circle in Fig. 5). Children in the somenoise condition had smaller placement errors (M = 2.3cm)
than children in the no-noise condition (M = 3.1cm) or
children in the all-noise condition (M = 3.6cm). In fact,
whether children in this age group were exposed to no noise
or only noise, placement errors were equally high. The same
effect of condition was not observed for 4- to 5-year-olds
(their mean error was uniformly high, independent of
condition) not was it found for adults (their mean error was
uniformly low). These findings show that noise, in the

successful to pick up on a possible effect of condition. The
steep learning curve during the initial five sessions supports
this conclusion. Furthermore, adults were quite successful at
judging the weight distribution of 3cm-beams—possibly
reducing the degree of perceived noise. In contrast,
preschoolers had considerable difficulty judging the weight
distribution of 3cm-beams: their performance was a chance.
This might have introduced too much noise in their
experience, reducing the potential benefits of noise in the
learning context. These speculations support the idea that
the benefits of noise might follow a U-shaped trajectory: too
much noise might hurt learning, as does too little noise—at
least when learning includes overcoming misconceptions.
