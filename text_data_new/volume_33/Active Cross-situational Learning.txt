Abstract: Human adults can acquire word-referent pairs from a short series of individually ambiguous situations
containing multiple words and referents (Yu & Smith, 2007). Cross-situational statistical learning is sufficient for
learners to passively acquire word-object pairs, as long as words co-occur with their correct referent multiple times
in different contexts. However, learners in the real world are not completely passive, but can affect how their
environment is structured to some extent. We compare performance in the original cross-situational word learning
task to performance in an equivalent active learning task in which participants choose the objects they would like to
hear named on each successive trial. Many learners perform much better in the active task, although some learners
did well in both tasks. We investigate the various strategies utilized by active learners and show how a model with
uncertainty can produce these strategies.
