Abstract: Observations from everyday life, the history of science, and well-controlled laboratory experiments suggest
that when it comes to choosing between competing causal explanations, simplicity is an important factor. Less
examined is the metric or metrics by which simplicity is quantified. Generally, it is assumed that simplicity can
be described by counting the number of elements in an explanation, e.g. the number of causes, and this approach
has been taken by fields as diverse as philosophy, psychology, and statistics. One alternative is that in the case of
causal reasoning, one might consider the simpler explanation to be the one that includes the fewest unexplained
causes, i.e. the fewest root nodes in the language of Bayesian causal-nets. We present two experiments supporting
the hypothesis that this metric for simplicity is sometimes used in choosing between explanations, and can outweigh
the total number of causes invoked in an explanation.
