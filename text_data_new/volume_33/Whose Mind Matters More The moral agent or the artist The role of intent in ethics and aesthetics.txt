Abstract
The current study directly investigates the similarities and
differences in theory of mind for moral judgment versus
aesthetic evaluation. We target the role of intent, the mind of
the moral agent or the artist, i.e. whether the moral act or
work of art was intentional or accidental, for objective
judgments (e.g., quality) versus subjective judgments (e.g.,
preference). We show that (1) intent matters more for
objective versus subjective judgments, in ethics and
aesthetics, and (2) overall, intent matters more for moral
judgments than aesthetic evaluations. These findings suggest
that an objective-subjective dimension may similarly
describe judgments in both ethics and aesthetics, and that in
general we may be more influenced by the mind of the
moral agent than by the mind of the artist when evaluating
their impact on the world.
Keywords: intent; aesthetic judgment; moral judgment;
social cognition; theory of mind

Mental states matter across a number of contexts, including
moral judgment (Borg, Hynes, Van Horn, Grafton, &
Sinnott-Armstrong, 2006; Young, Cushman, Hauser, & Saxe,
2007; Cushman, 2008; Mikhail, 2007) and artistic evaluation
(Gelman & Bloom, 2000; Bloom & Markson, 1998; HawleyDolan & Winner, 2011). People speculate about the harmful
or helpful intentions of their social partners, and about an
artist’s mental state (i.e. what the artist planned and intended)
when responding to the art itself (Bloom, 2004; Donald,
2006; Freeman & Adi-Japha, 2008; Hawley-Dolan &
Winner, 2011). Here, we provide a direct comparison of the
role of mental states in people’s intuitive “subjective” versus
“objective” judgments of moral actions versus works of art.
Recent research suggests that, for art, mental states
may matter differently depending on whether people are
instructed to provide an “objective” evaluation (e.g., of the
quality of the art) or a “subjective” evaluation (e.g., personal
preference) (Hawley-Dolan & Winner, 2011). In particular,
subjective judgments were based more on the use of
“preferred colors”, while objective judgments were explained
by appeal to “the purposeful use of space” and “the
intentionality of line”. Furthermore, objective but not
subjective judgments were sensitive to information about the
artist’s identity (e.g., a young child, a chimpanzee, or a
professional artist). Finally, participants often reported
“liking” an image while simultaneously judging it to be
objectively “bad art”. The current study directly investigates
the role of intent (i.e. whether a work of art was created

intentionally or accidentally) for objective and subjective
aesthetic judgments.
A parallel body of work suggests that moral
judgments depend critically on mental state inferences:
people assign more blame for intentional versus accidental
harms and more praise for intentionally versus accidentally
helpful actions (Cushman, 2008; Pizarro, Uhlmann, &
Salovey, 2003; Young, Scholz, & Saxe, in press). Little is
known, however, about the possible distinction between
subjective and objective moral judgments, or the impact of
intent on subjective versus objective judgments. Recent
research has revealed individual differences in moral
objectivism versus subjectivism; some people tend to be
moral objectivists, taking ethical beliefs to express factual
truths, while others tend to be moral subjectivists, treating
fact and value as independent (Goodwin & Darley, 2008;
Nichols & Folds-Bennett, 2003). Key questions remain: In
the moral domain, is there a reliable cognitive division
between subjective and objective judgments? Can we “like” a
person whom we judge to be morally inferior, just as we can
enjoy an image that we won’t count as “good” art?
Specifically, are subjective versus objective judgments
governed by distinct cognitive rules (e.g., intentionality)?
The current study investigates both the distinction
between subjective versus objective judgments for the
domains of art and morality, in addition to the role of intent
for both kinds of judgments in both domains. We present two
experiments that show that (1) intent matters more for
objective versus subjective judgments of both moral actions
and works of art, and (2) overall, intent matters more for
moral judgments than aesthetic evaluations.

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 investigated whether (1) intent matters more
for objective versus subjective judgments of works of art and
morally relevant actions (e.g., harmful and helpful actions),
and (2) intent matters more for moral judgments versus
aesthetic evaluations.
Methods
Participants
Participants were 31 undergraduate psychology majors at
Boston College, who participated for course credit (11 males,
20 females, ages 17-27 years, M =19.4).

Materials and Procedure
Presentation of art and moral tasks was counterbalanced
across participants.
Art: Stimuli consisted of four non-representational abstract1
images created by professional artists whose work we
selected from art history textbooks (e.g. Hans Hoffman,
Helen Frankenthaler). Images were presented one by one on
a laptop; images were equated in size and resolution, to the
extent that it was possible to do without distortion. Images
were given black borders with no frame visible; signatures of
the professional artists were removed using Adobe
Photoshop.
A brief narrative accompanied each image,
presented directly above it, indicating how the image was
created and by whom. Narratives were constructed to
manipulate the process by which the image was created:
accidentally or intentionally. Word count was matched across
conditions. Images were seen as accidental or intentional an
equal number of times, across participants (Figure 1).

Figure 2. Sample Moral Scenarios. Positive moral stories on
left, negative moral stories on right.
Following the presentation of each story, participants were
asked to make two different kinds of judgments: (1)
Subjective: “How much do you like your [cousin, friend,
neighbor, colleague, co-worker, sister, classmate] at this
moment? (1 = Not at all, 7 = Very Much); (2) Objective: “Is
your [cousin, friend, neighbor, colleague, co-worker, sister,
classmate] a good person?” (1 = No, absolutely not, 7 = Yes,
absolutely).
To ensure that the negative and positive moral
stories were matched in outcome severity, we asked a
separate group of participants: (1) Is this a big deal to you? (1
= Not a big deal, 7 = A very big deal), and (2) Objectively
speaking, is this event significant? (1= Not at all, 7 = Very
much). Participants did not distinguish between positive and
negative moral stories in terms of severity (question 1: t(3) =
-.375, p = .73; question 2; t(3) = .176, p = .87).

Figure 1. Sample Art Image, with narratives.
Following the presentation of each image and associated
story, participants were asked to make two different kinds of
judgments: (1) Subjective: “How much do you like this
image at this moment?”; (1 = Not at all, 7 = Very Much); (2)
Objective: “Is this a good work of art?”; (1 = No, absolutely
not, 7 = Yes, absolutely).

Intentional-Accidental (IA) Difference Scores for Analyses:
To assess the role of intent, that is, the difference between
intentional versus accidental actions, across both positive and
negative moral scenarios and art images, we calculated
critical IA difference scores: Judgment of Intentional act or
image minus Judgment of Accidental act or image. Absolute
values of differences scores were used in analyses below
where specified (e.g., when comparing across judgments of
positive and negative actions). IA difference scores therefore
reflect the extent to which the dimension of intent makes a
difference.

Morality: Sixteen moral scenarios were constructed to
manipulate the agent’s intent: whether the agent acted
accidentally or intentionally. Scenarios included eight
positive stories, describing helpful actions, and eight negative

stories, describing harmful actions. There were two versions
of each story: accidental or intentional (See Figure 2). Word

count was matched across conditions.
Paired sample t-tests of aesthetic judgment revealed a
difference between objective judgments of accidentally (M =

3.18, p < .03); however, there was no difference in subjective
judgments of accidentally (M = 4.1) versus intentionally
made images (M = 4.4; t(30) = 1.12, p = .29). A Intent x
Judgment (dependent variable) ANOVA revealed a
significant interaction (F(1, 30) = 6.12, MSE = 2.33, p <
.019). Intent mattered more for objective than subjective
artistic judgments.
In addition, subjective judgments of accidentally
made images (M = 4.1) were higher than objective judgments
of accidentally made images (M = 3.69; t(30) = 2.4, p < .02),
consistent with prior work showing that people can like
images that aren’t intentionally made but judge them as being
of objectively lower quality (Hawley-Dolan & Winner,
2011).
Morality
We conducted a series of paired sample t-tests using IA
difference scores (absolute values). Intent mattered more for
objective judgments than subjective judgments, for both
positive moral stories (t(30) = -3.05, p < .005) and negative
moral stories (t(30) = 3.42, p < .002).
Art versus Morality
We conducted a 2x2 Domain (art vs. morality) x Judgment
(subjective vs. objective) ANOVA of IA difference scores
(absolute values) to determine whether intent mattered more
for moral judgments versus aesthetic judgments, overall.
First, this analysis revealed a main effect of Judgment (F(1,
30) = 7.59, MSE = 4.84, p < .010). That is, Intent mattered
more for objective (M = 1.63) versus subjective judgments
(M = 1.23), replicating the patterns observed above in the
separate analyses of Art and Morality.
Second, as predicted, we found a main effect of
Domain (F(1, 30) = 15.45, MSE = 14.22, p < .001). That is,
Intent mattered more for judgments of moral actions (M =
1.77) than for judgments of artistic images (M = 1.09).
Lastly, Domain interacted with Judgment, (F(1, 30) = 7.96,
MSE = 2.19, p < .008). That is, there was a greater disparity
between subjective and objective ratings within the moral
domain (Msubjective = 1.44, Mobjective = 2.10) than in the art
domain (Msubjective = 1.03, Mobjective = 1.16).

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 replicates and extends Experiment 1 by
including new images of “bad” art, in addition to the original
images of “good” art used in Experiment 1.
Methods
Participants
Participants were 34 new undergraduate psychology majors
at Boston College who participated for course credit (13
males, 21 females, ages, 18-21 years, M =19.1).
Materials and procedure
Art: Materials and procedure were identical to those outlined
in Experiment 1, with the following exceptions. Stimuli
consisted of the same four “good” art images from
Experiment 1, and four new “bad” art images. “Bad” art
images were selected from websites displaying art by
children under the age of 3 years. The “bad” art resembled
scribbles and random marks (Figure 4). As in Experiment 1,
each image was accompanied by a brief narrative, indicating
whether the image was created intentionally or accidentally.
As expected, a paired sample t-test revealed that good art (M
= 4.2) was judged better than bad art (M = 1.29) (t(33) =
11.285, p = < .001) (collapsing across both kinds of
judgments).

Art
As predicted, paired sample t-tests using IA difference scores
(absolute values) revealed that intent mattered more for
objective judgments than subjective judgments, for good art
(t(33) = 2.989, p < .005) and for bad art (t(33) = 3.442, p <
.002). That is, when responding to good art and bad art,

2176

participants subjectively liked accidentally made art (good
art: M = 4.1; bad art: M = 2.3) but rated it as less good
objectively (good art: M = 3.9; bad art: M = 1.8). However,
we found no difference between subjective versus objective
judgments of intentionally made art (good art subjective, M =
4.1; objective, M = 4.3; bad art subjective, M = 2.3;
objective, M = 2.2).
Morality
We conducted a series of paired sample t-tests using IA
difference scores (absolute values). As in Experiment 1,
intent mattered more for objective than subjective judgments,
for both positive moral stories (t(33) = -3.45, p < .002) and
negative moral stories (t(33) = -2.035, p < .05).
Art versus Morality
We conducted a 2x2x2 Domain (art vs. morality) x Judgment
(subjective vs. objective) x Valence (positive/good vs.
negative/bad) ANOVA of IA difference scores (absolute
values) to determine whether intent mattered more for moral
judgments versus aesthetic judgments. We replicated findings
in Experiment 1. We found a main effect of Judgment (F(1,
33) = 10.85, MSE = 7.28, p < .001): Intent mattered more for
objective judgments (M = 1.40) than for subjective
judgments (M = 1.077). We found a main effect of Domain
(F(1, 33) = 36.24, MSE = 32.141, p < .001). Intent mattered
more for judgments in the moral domain (M = 1.58) than for
judgments in the art domain (M = .89). We found a main
effect of Valence (F(1, 33) = 32.28, MSE = 22.08, p < .001).
Intent mattered more for negative images and stories (M =
1.52) than for positive images and stories (M = .95).
In addition, Domain interacted with Valence (F(1,
33) = 49.62, MSE = 61.65, p < .001): there was a greater
difference between responses to negative stories (M = 2.34)
vs. positive stories (M = .82) within the moral domain, than
between responses to bad (M = .7) vs. good art (M = 1.08).
Lastly, Domain interacted with Judgment (F(1, 33) = 4.10,
MSE = 3.42, p < .05): we found a greater difference between
subjective (M = 1.3) and objective (M = 1.86) judgments in
the moral versus art domain (subjective: M = .84; objective:
M = .94).

Discussion
The current results provide support for our key
predictions. First, intent matters more for objective than
subjective judgments not only of works of art (Cf. HawleyDolan & Winner, 2011) but also of moral actions. Second,
intent matters more for judgments of moral actions than
judgments of works of art. These results reveal similarities
and differences in the cognitive processes that support our
judgments for ethics and aesthetics. At the broadest level,
people consider the mental states of both moral agents and
artists when understanding and appreciating their actions.
However, as we discuss below, these results also offer an
account of how moral and aesthetic judgments diverge.
Recent research has targeted similar questions
separately for the psychology of morality and the psychology

of art. Structural models of aesthetic appreciation have asked
whether aesthetic evaluations are affected primarily by
automatic, unconscious, and emotionally driven processes, or
evaluative, principled, and controlled processes (Hagtvedt,
Hagtvedt, & Patrick, 2008; Leder, Belke, Oeberst, &
Augustin, 2004). In parallel, work in moral psychology and
neuroscience has investigated the extent to which “reason” or
“emotion” dominates human moral judgment (Haidt et al.,
2001; Greene et al., 2004; Hauser et al., 2007; Cushman,
Young, & Hauser, 2006). Researchers in both domains have
also considered the contribution of culturally mediated versus
universal components (Hauser et al., 2007; Haidt et al., 1993;
Berylne, 1970; Child, 1965; Eysenck, Götz, Long, Nias, &
Ross, 1984; Parsons, 1987).
In keeping with the tensions brought out in this prior
literature, the current study reveals a distinction between
objective and subjective judgments in the domains of art and
morality. Participants weighed intent more heavily for
objective than subjective judgments of works of art (Cf.
Hawley-Dolan & Winner, 2011) as well as moral actions.
Recent research indicates individual differences in moral
judgment styles: some people are, on average, moral
objectivists, while others are, on average, moral subjectivists
(Goodwin & Darley, 2008; Nichols & Folds-Bennett, 2003).
Future research should investigate whether moral objectivists
assign more moral weight to intent, in general.
Differences between art and morality also emerged.
We observed a greater role for intent in moral judgments than
aesthetic judgments, when they were objective and
subjective. These results suggest that though intent plays a
key role in both ethics and aesthetics, people assign more
weight to the intent of the moral agent compared to the artist,
when evaluating the consequences of their actions. One
possible interpretation is that moral judgment, on the whole,
is perceived to be more “objective” than aesthetic judgment,
even when people are simply evaluating whether they like or
dislike a person (which in the current study represented a
“subjective” judgment). One can imagine befriending
someone with different taste in art, but not in people.
These results may relate to recent research
suggesting that intent matters more for certain kinds of moral
judgments compared to others (Young & Saxe, in press). In
particular, intent matters more for moral judgments of
harmful actions (e.g., one person poisons another), compared
to moral judgments of “purity violations”, which people may
find offensive even in the absence of any adverse
consequences (e.g., unusual but harmless sexual practices;
eating taboo but nutritious foods). The current findings
suggest that moral norms against purity violations may
reflect people’s subjective preferences (e.g., what offends
people’s sensibilities), to a greater extent than moral norms
against harmful actions.
The current work investigates how information
about intent informs and influences our moral and aesthetic
judgments. Recent work has also shown that evaluative
judgments, including, especially judgments of moral blame,
crucially influence mental state inferences, including

2177

attributions of intent and knowledge (Knobe, 2005; 2010).
Interestingly, convergent research suggests that people may
also use the formal properties of an image to reason
“backwards” to the intent of the artist (Hawley-Dolan &
Winner, 2011). Future work should therefore compare these
bi-directional effects for both art and morality, and also
compare the impact of subjective versus objective
evaluations on mental state inferences.
Mental states fulfil many everyday social functions,
not simply moral or artistic evaluation but also reading facial
expressions (e.g. Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, &
Plumb, 2001; Kaliouby & Robinson, 2005), preparing for an
acting role (Goldstein, Wu, & Winner, 2010), and predicting
and explaining other people’s behavior (e.g., Perner,
Aichorn, Kronbichler, Wolfgang, & Laddurner, 2006; Saxe
& Powell, 2006). Whether the current approach can be
applied to other key domains of social interaction will
certainly be worth exploring.
