Abstract: Unconscious cognition plays an important role in solving insight problems. Metacognition is also known
to be effective in enhancing creative thinking. Little is known, however, about how unconscious thought and metacognition interact. The current study first examined whether a hint that could not be consciously perceived has an effect
on facilitating problem solving (Experiment 1). 102 participants tried to solve the nine-dot problem; half of them
after exposure to a subliminal hint. The hint doubled the solution rate. Experiment 2 examined how this effect
interacted with metacognitive instructions. 146 participants solved the same problem under one of four conditions
defined by crossing exposure or nonexposure to a subliminal hint with metacognitive control instructions present or
absent. The hint raised the solution rate and so did metacognition, but the effect almost disappeared when both
were introduced. The results suggest that metacognitive control sometimes operates without monitoring.
