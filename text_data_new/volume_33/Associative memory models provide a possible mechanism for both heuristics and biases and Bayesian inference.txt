Associative memory models provide a possible mechanism for both
heuristics and biases and Bayesian inference

Abstract: Heuristics and biases program described some behaviors of human decision making as adaptive prerational tools that lead to different kinds of structural cognitive errors. Some criticism on this program relay over
the absence of theoretical and mechanistic models of heuristics.
Cognitive errors in medical diagnosis are widely described as biases provoked by the use of heuristics in realistic
clinical frameworks. Here we show that associative memory models instructed to perform medical diagnosis by
capturing frequencies from the environment display the same biases observed in clinical practice. This suggests that
the mechanism underlying heuristics and biases could be of associative nature.
In addition, the mathematics of the model links its performance with Bayesian inference. We find valuable to
consider the possibility that the associative nature of human memory could be acting as a unifying mechanism
explaining both heuristics and biases and Bayesian inference.
