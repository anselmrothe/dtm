Abstract
We propose that the unique ability of humans to have
separate mental representations for each finger and to
move them in different sequential orders were
redeployed for arithmetic. We tested our hypothesis
with a behavioral dual-task experiment, where subjects
(N=46) solved addition problems (primary task) and
performed a sentence comprehension task (control
task), while concurrently tapping their fingers
(secondary task). We examined two sequential finger
tapping tasks: one that was more automatic and
followed the anatomical finger order (simple) and one
that relied heavily on sequence processing (complex).
The results revealed that both simple and complex
finger tapping differentially interfered with addition
compared to sentence comprehension. These results
provide support for a finger-based representation of
numbers and shared use of sequence processing
resources for finger movements and addition.

The Relationship Between Fingers and
Number Processing
A relation between fingers and number processing was
first formulated in 1924 when Josef Gerstmann diagnosed a
condition, now named Gerstmann’s syndrome, with four cooccurring symptoms: finger agnosia (loss of finger sense),
acalculia (inability to carry out simple mathematical
calculations), left-right disorientation and agraphia (inability
to write). Gerstmann found that the condition was most
commonly due to a lesion in the left angular gyrus
(Gerstmann, 1940). He believed that the main symptom was
finger agnosia, a specific type of body schema impairment
(autopagnosia) affecting the mental representation of hands
and fingers. He proposed that the loss of finger sense
combined with the left-right disorientation caused
acalculia,(Butterworth, 1999, p. 219). There have been a
number of studies reporting data to support Gerstmann’s
theory. For example, a study examining patients with
tumors in and around the angular gyrus found that these
patients had impairments in writing, calculating, and finger
recognition (Roux, Boetto, Sacko, Chollet, & Tremoulet,
2003). Also, in an rTMS study of healthy subjects it was
found that disruption of the left angular gyrus impaired

access to the finger schema and number magnitude
processing (Rusconi, Walsh, & Butterworth, 2005).
Additionally, a series of behavioral studies have consistently
shown that finger gnosia in younger children is a predictor
of numerical abilities; pointing to a functional relation
between finger representation and number processing (Noel,
2005; Penner-Wilger et al., 2007).
While there is evidence to support Gerstmann’s theory, an
opposing theory suggests that acalculia in Gerstmann’s
syndrome is due to an impairment in mental manipulation of
images and not to a deficit in the representation of hands
and fingers (Mayer et al., 1999). In a study with healthy
patients rTMS to the angular gyrus disrupted both a visual
search and a number comparison task (Gobel, Walsh, &
Rushworth, 2001). However, this finding only partially
supports the opposing theory because the effects of rTMS
on finger schema representation were not tested.
The question of whether acalculia in Gerstmann
syndrome is due to finger representation or visuo-spatial
processing impairments characterizes a general discussion:
To what extent is number representation body-based?
Fischer (2008) explored whether finger-counting habits
interact with the SNARC (Spatial-Numerical Association of
Response Codes) effect, which is an association of small
numbers with the left visual field and big numbers with the
right visual field (Dehaene, Bossini, & Giraux, 1993). The
results revealed that subjects who are left-starters show a
SNARC effect significantly more than right-starters. Di
Luca, Grana, Semenza, Seron and Pesenti (2006) asked
subjects to identify Arabic digits by pressing one of 10 keys
with all 10 fingers. The configuration of response buttons
varied both in terms of the global direction of the hand-digit
mapping and the direction of the finger-digit mapping
within each hand, from small to large digits or vice versa.
The results showed that subjects performed better when
there was a congruency between the reported fingercounting strategy of the subject and the mapping of the
response buttons. Both studies (Di Luca, et al., 2006;
Fischer, 2008) provide evidence for the dominance of a
finger-based number representation compared to a spatial
one.
Although arithmetic, and more generally number
processing, involves sequential manipulation of numbers the
role of sequence processing in number processing is not
well understood. Neuroimaging evidence suggests a relation
1

based on the neural overlap between visual-motor
sequencing (Buhusi & Meck, 2005) and number processing
(Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel, Stanescu, & Tsivkin, 1999),
particularly in cerebellum and IPS (Intra-parietal sulcus)
(Sakai, Ramnani, & Passingham, 2002). Both visuo-spatial
and motor simulation strategies used in calculation require
sequencing under conditions with time constraints and this
might explain the cerebellar activity in calculation tasks
(Arsalidou & Taylor, 2010).
In this study we test claims about a finger-based
representation of numbers from a performance based
perspective. If numbers are grounded in a system that is
originally used for finger processing, than we hypothesize
that movement of fingers should interfere with number
processing differentially compared to a non-numerical
control task, since finger movement would demand more
overlapping resources with number processing. Arithmetic
often requires representation and manipulation of different
numbers. Similarly, finger tapping with multiple fingers
require activation of finger representations in different
sequences. Therefore, arithmetic and sequential finger
tapping might use a shared sequence processing system. Our
second hypothesis is that manipulation of the complexity of
the finger tapping sequence should differentially modulate
the interference with arithmetic compared to a sentence
comprehension control task. We used a dual-task design to
test these two hypotheses.
We manipulated the task difficulty for addition to
investigate the differential effect of finger processing on the
retrieval of arithmetic facts (easy) and calculation (hard).
The comparison of single conditions with dual conditions
involving simple tapping (dual-simple) allowed us to
determine whether finger processing resources are shared
with number processing. The manipulation of the
complexity of finger tapping allowed us to determine
whether sequence processing resources are shared between
addition and finger tapping.
We predicted that addition would be differentially
affected by both simple tapping and complex tapping
compared to sentence comprehension, due to: first, a fingerbased representation of numbers and, second, involvement
of sequence processing both in addition and finger tapping.
We also predicted the finger tapping interference on easy
and hard addition questions to be comparable for the simple
tapping condition, and higher for hard addition questions for
the complex tapping. Previous research shows that
arithmetic questions answered from rote memory use
fundamentally different brain networks compared to
questions requiring calculation (Dehaene & Cohen, 1997;
Lee, 2000) therefore we expect rote memory operations to
be less affected by sequential finger tapping compared to
calculation.

Methods
Participants
46 adults (age 18-28, M=19.90, 35 females, all right
handed) were recruited from the Indiana University
community. None of the subjects reported any
neuropsychological conditions except one with dyslexia.
Data from four subjects were excluded due to low (lower
than 3 standard deviations below the mean) finger tapping
or arithmetic performance.

Stimuli
The experiment utilized a dual-task paradigm. The
primary task was addition. The addition problem was
presented at the top of the screen with 4 possible answers at
the bottom. There were two levels of difficulty. Easy
questions involved addition of three numbers between 1 and
4, and hard questions involved the addition of two numbers
between 11 and 99, excluding multiplies of 5. The
secondary task was finger tapping involving the four fingers
of the right hand (no little finger), with two levels of
complexity. The simple sequence followed the anatomical
order of fingers (ring, middle, index and thumb), and the
complex sequence followed the “ring, thumb, middle and
index” order. It was previously shown that learning to tap
sequentially at a given rhythm allocates additional resources
compared to sequential tapping with an uncontrolled
rhythm. Therefore, the subjects were told to tap
rhythmically at a self-controlled and comfortable pace
(Sakai, et al., 2002). We had a control language task; a
sentence comprehension task. In the comprehension task
subjects were presented with a sentence at the top of the
screen, and a true/false comprehension probe at the bottom.
The comprehension task also had two levels of difficulty,
with active sentences used in the easy condition and passive
sentences in the hard condition.
Finger tapping complexity was presented in two separate
blocks such that the dual task condition in one block
involved tapping with the simple sequence while the other
block involved the complex sequence. The order of the
blocks was counterbalanced across subjects. Each block
consisted of 20 trials of single addition, single
comprehension,
dual
addition-tapping
and
dual
comprehension-tapping conditions. In addition, single finger
tapping trials were included which consisted of 15 secs of
tapping while a fixation crosshair was presented on the
screen.
While finger tapping was performed with the right hand,
subjects responded to the addition and comprehension trials
with their left hands. Subjects responded to the addition
trials by pressing the “a”, ”s”, ”d”, and “f” buttons on the
keyboard (matching with A,B,C,D choices), using their
little, ring, middle and index fingers respectively. They used
“a” (true) and “s” (false) keyboard buttons, matching with
middle and index fingers respectively, to respond to the
comprehension probe.

performed a 2 (simple vs. complex tapping) x 2 (addition vs.
comprehension) x 2 (easy vs. hard) within subjects ANOVA
on tapping performance to investigate the effects of
sequential processing load on tapping performance. The
analysis revealed a main effect of complexity
[F(1,45)=123.99, p<0.0001] and task [F(1,45)=12.28,
p=0.001] (Fig. 3).
There was an interaction between complexity and task
[F(2,45)=0.320, p=0.574].The post-hoc analysis revealed
that while there was a significant difference between
difficulty collapsed tapping performance averages for
simple tapping addition (M=5.76, SD=2.24) and
comprehension (M=6.06, SD=2.20) values, there were no
significant differences between addition (M=2.82, SD=0.87)
and comprehension (M=2.87, SD=0.84) for complex
tapping conditions. Therefore the interaction is due to the
relatively bigger interference of addition on simple-finger
tapping compared to comprehension.

Discussion
Our overall motivation in this study was to explore the
embodiment of number processing. We aimed to determine
whether arithmetic shares resources with finger movement
processes from a performance based perspective. Within a
dual-task paradigm we compared addition to a control,
sentence comprehension task.
Task accuracy for addition and comprehension failed to
show interference effects. However, tapping performance
results(for the simple sequence) showed that addition
affected simple tapping and revealed differential effects in
that performance was lower when solving addition problems
than during sentence comprehension. There was no
differential effect for the complex sequence.
Finger tapping interference was observed for both tasks
when examining RT. Participants were told to answer all
questions as accurately as possible and not to sacrifice from
tapping performance or task accuracy during the dual-trials
but to weigh accuracy higher. Therefore results are
compatible with the instructions given to the participants
and the discussion will focus on the RT results.
One of the predictions was that addition would be
differentially affected by both simple tapping and complex
tapping compared to sentence comprehension. This was
observed here. For both the simple tapping and complex
tapping a significant interaction between dual/single and
task was observed which indicated that addition
performance was more affected by tapping. We argue that
one reason for this increased interference is that both finger
tapping and addition rely on a finger-based representation.
The participants in this study were all adult, college students
therefore it is not likely that they used finger counting
strategies to solve the addition problems. Instead, we argue
that the finger representation is tied to and facilitates
processing of number and this is seen in the results
presented.

Second, we predicted that when the demand on sequence
processing increases in the finger tapping task the
interference with addition would also increase. This was
also observed here. Sequence processing is an important
aspect of arithmetic. This includes finger counting to the
algorithms typically used in adding two or more digits.
However unexpectedly, both easy and hard addition were
affected by the additional sequencing load. This might be
because although the majority of the operations taking place
in easy addition involve rote memory retrieval, the solution
still involves taking multiple executive steps, which might
require sequence processing resources.
It should also be noted that aspects of sentence processing
also involves sequence processing, particularly syntactic
processing. For example, Pulvermuller (2003) suggests that
syntax is built on serial-order mechanisms. As a result, it
was expected that the complex finger tapping sequence
would affect comprehension more so than the simple
sequence and the data presented does hint at this.
The increase in process overlap between finger tapping
and addition compared to comprehension implies that these
two tasks may also share neural resources. Previous
neuroimaging research showing shared neural resource
allocation for finger representation and number processing
supports this interpretation (Sato, Cattaneo, Rizzolatti, &
Gallese, 2007; Zago et al., 2001). From a functional
standpoint the results provide support for the previously
established relation between the mental representation of
fingers and numerical quantity (Noel, 2005; Penner-Wilger,
et al., 2007). In addition we propose that sequence
processing resources are also shared between finger motor
processes and number processing.

Limitations & Future Directions
An alternative interpretation for the results would be that
addition is more prone to dual-task interference compared to
sentence comprehension, independent of the nature of the
secondary task. Therefore future experiments should focus
on testing if other motor tasks (e.g. jumping) would also
show differential interference for addition. Based on our
hypotheses we would predict that a non-hand or finger
related secondary motor task not cause differential
interference for addition. Additionally a double dissociation
of addition and comprehension can be established by
finding a motor task that differentially interferes with
comprehension, which would provide further support for
our claims. Nevertheless, there are practical limitations
about capturing non-hand related motor movements. Also
due to lack of previous research on motor task interference
in mathematics or sentence comprehension it is challenging
to narrow down the secondary task possibilities.
Previous research shows that the motor system is involved
in semantic language processing (Buccino et al., 2005;
Kemmerer & Gonzalez-Castillo, 2008), therefore it is
possible that finger tapping interference is modulated by the
relevance of sentence semantic content to hand/finger
related movements. Although we did not control for the
5

semantic content, none of the sentences involved
hand/finger related verbs (e.g. grasp, tap, squeeze).
We are currently conducting an fMRI adaptation of the
same experiment to investigate the neural dynamics of the
finger tapping and addition relation. This study will allow
for the assessment of the neural overlap between these two
tasks which would provide strong evidence to support the
embodiment of arithmetic.

Conclusion
Mathematics is a representation hungry knowledge
domain presenting challenges for the idea of embodied
cognition. In this study we explored the embodiment of
arithmetic by investigating the shared resource usage
between addition and finger tapping. We found evidence for
shared use of resources between addition and finger tapping
at different levels of complexity. This study is unique in two
aspects: First, we focused on the role of sequence
processing in the interaction between finger movements and
arithmetic, which has not been studied before. Second, by
studying dual task interference we adopted a performance
based approach to explore the interaction between motor
and arithmetic processes.
