Abstract
Holistic processing has long been considered as a property of
right hemisphere (RH) processing. Nevertheless, recent
studies showed reduced holistic processing and increased RH
lateralization in Chinese character recognition expertise,
suggesting that these two effects may separate. Through
computational modeling, in which we implement a theory of
hemispheric asymmetry in perception that posits a low
frequency bias in the RH and a high frequency bias in the left
hemisphere, we show that when the recognition task relies
purely on featural information, holistic processing increases
whereas RH lateralization decreases with increasing stimulus
similarity; there is a negative correlation between them. In
contrast, when the task relies purely on configural information,
although RH lateralization negatively correlates with stimulus
similarity, holistic processing does not correlate with stimulus
similarity; there is a positive correlation between them. This
suggests that holistic processing and RH lateralization do not
always go together, depending on the task requirements.
Keywords: holistic processing, hemispheric asymmetry,

Introduction
Holistic processing and right hemisphere lateralization
In face recognition, a holistic processing effect has been
consistently reported; it refers to the phenomenon that we
view faces as a whole instead of various parts, and has been
argued to be related to our expertise in face processing (e.g.,
Bukach, Gauthier, & Tarr, 2006; although some argue that it
is specific to faces; e.g., McKone, Kanwisher, & Duchaine,
2007). Subsequent studies suggest a correlation between an
increase in holistic processing and expertise in subordinatelevel individualization as opposed to basic-level
categorization (e.g., Gauthier et al., 1998; Wong, Palmeri, &
Gauthier, 2009).
In addition to holistic processing, another well-known
effect in face recognition is the right hemisphere (RH)
lateralization effect. For example, behaviorally a left side
bias in face perception has been observed: a chimeric face
made from two left half faces from the viewer‟s perspective
is usually judged more similar to the original face than one
made from two right half faces (Gilbert & Bakan, 1973);
this effect has been argued to be an indication of the RH
involvement in face processing (e.g., Burt & Perrett, 1997).
fMRI studies show that an area inside the fusiform gyrus
(fusiform face area) responds selectively to faces (although
some argue that it is an area for expertise in subordinatelevel visual processing instead; Tarr & Gauthier, 2000) with
larger activation in the RH than the left hemisphere (LH)

(e.g. Kanwisher, McDermott, & Chun, 1997). ERP data
show that faces elicit larger N170 than other types of
objects, especially in the RH (Rossion et al., 2003).
Neuropsychological data also suggest a link between RH
damage and deficits in face recognition (e.g. Meadows,
1974). In short, the RH lateralization in face processing has
been consistently reported.
The holistic face processing effect has been shown to be
linked to brain activation in face selective areas especially in
the RH (e.g., Schiltz et al., 2010; Harris & Aguirre, 2008). It
has also been shown that the increase in holistic processing
after artificial object recognition training is correlated with
right fusiform area activity (Gauthier & Tarr, 2002). These
results are consistent with the hemispheric asymmetry
literature that posits a holistic/analytic dichotomy between
RH and LH processing (e.g., Bradshaw & Nettleton, 1981),
and suggest a close relationship between holistic processing
and RH lateralization. Nevertheless, Hsiao and Cottrell
(2009) recently showed that Chinese character recognition
experts have reduced holistic processing and increased RH
lateralization in processing Chinese characters compared
with novices. This effect suggests that holistic processing
and RH lateralization may be separate processes that do not
always go together.
Faces and Chinese characters differ in both featural and
configural dimensions 1 . In the featural dimension, faces
consist of common components (i.e. the eyes, nose, and
mouth) and the components of different faces usually look
similar to each other; in contrast, Chinese character
recognition involves discriminating different combinations
of more than a thousand stroke patterns (Hsiao & Shillcock,
2006), which usually look dissimilar to each other. In the
configural dimension, second-order spatial relations (i.e.
distances) between face components have been shown to be
more important in face recognition than in the recognition of
other visual object classes (e.g., Farah et al., 1998), whereas
this configural information is not important in Chinese
character recognition, since changes in distance among
character components do not change the character identity
(e.g., Ge et al., 2006). In order to understand how difference
in task requirements in either the featural or the configural
dimension modulates holistic processing and RH
lateralization in recognition tasks, here we adopt a
computational modeling approach, since modeling allows
1
Note that in the literature of face recognition, the definition of
of configural processing often varied among studies. Here we refer
to the configural dimension as second-order spatial relations (e.g.,
Mondloch, Grand, & Maurer, 2002).

good control over variables that may be hard to tease apart
in human subject studies. We introduce our model below.
Hemispheric processing model
Anatomically our visual field is split along the vertical
midline, with the two hemifields initially contralaterally
projected to the two hemispheres. In order to examine at
which processing stage this split information converges,
Hsiao, Shieh, and Cottrell (2008) conducted a modeling
study aiming to account for the left side bias effect in face
perception. They proposed 3 models with different timings
of convergence: early, intermediate, and late (Figure 1), and
showed that both the intermediate and late convergence
models were able to account for the effect, whereas the early
convergence model failed to show the effect.

(HSF) information, while the RH amplifies low spatial
frequency (LSF) information. This differential frequency
bias in the two hemispheres was implemented in the model
by using two sigmoid functions assigning different weights
to the Gabor responses in the two hemispheres (Figure 2).
Modeling holistic processing effects
In human studies, holistic processing is usually assessed
through the composite paradigm (e.g., Gauthier & Bukach,
2007). In this paradigm, two stimuli are presented briefly,
either sequentially or simultaneously. Participants attend to
either the top or bottom halves of the stimuli and judge
whether they are the same or different. In congruent trials,
the attended and irrelevant halves lead to the same response,
whereas in incongruent trials, they lead to different
responses. Holistic processing is indicated by the
interference from the irrelevant halves in matching the
attended halves; it can be assessed by the performance
difference between the congruent and the incongruent trials
(Figure 3).

Figure 1: Hemispheric models with different
timing of convergence (Hsiao et al., 2008).

Figure 3: The complete composite design with Chinese
characters as the stimuli. The example shows the condition
in which the bottom halves (components in grey) are the
attended halves (taken from Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009).

Figure 2: Hsiao et al.‟s model (2008).
Hsiao et al.‟s (2008) model incorporated several known
observations about visual anatomy and neural computation.
They used Gabor responses over the input images to
simulate neural responses of cells in the early visual area
(Lades et al., 1993), and Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), a biologically plausible linear compression
technique (Sanger, 1989), to simulate possible information
extraction processes beyond the early visual area. They then
used this PCA representation as the input to a two-layer
neural network (Figure 2). In addition, they implemented a
theory of hemispheric asymmetry in perception, Double
Filtering by Frequency theory (DFF, Ivry & Robertson,
1998) in the model. The theory posits that visual
information coming into the brain goes through two
frequency-filtering stages: The first stage involves
attentional selection of a task-relevant frequency range. At
the second stage, the LH amplifies high spatial frequency

The holistic face processing effect has been accounted for
by computational models. For example, Cottrell, Branson,
and Calder (2002) trained a computational model to perform
a face identification task and an expression judgment task,
and showed that the model was able to account for holistic
processing effects in both tasks. Richler, Mach, Gauthier,
and Palmeri (2007) also used a variant of Cottrell et al.‟s
(2002) model to account for the holistic processing effect in
face recognition. Similar to Hsiao et al.‟s (2008) early
convergence model (Figure 1), Richler et al.‟s model (2007)
applied Gabor filters to the input image, followed by PCA,
and then a two-layer neural network performing the
classification task, without a split architecture or frequency
biases. To assess holistic processing effects, after training
the hidden layer representation of each input face image was
used as its internal representation in the visual working
memory. Selective attention to the cued part in the
composite paradigm was simulated by attenuating the Gabor
response representation of the unattended half by a factor of
0.125. In each trial, the correlation between the
representations of each pair of faces was used as the
similarity measure; the difference in this measure between
same and different trials was used to calculate d, and the
difference in d between the congruent and incongruent
conditions was used as the measure of holistic processing.
Here we apply the method used by Richler et al. (2007; cf.
Cottrell et al., 2002) to assess holistic processing in our
model.

Configural vs. featureal recognition tasks
To examine people‟s sensitivity to configural and featural
changes in face recognition, Mondloch et al. (2007) created
some carefully controlled datasets: in the configural set,
faces had the same features (i.e., the eyes, mouth, and nose)
and differed only in the distance between these features; in
contrast, in the featural dataset, faces had the same
distance/configuration among features but the features were
different. Here we create our datasets in a similar fashion, in
order to examine the relationship between holistic
processing and RH lateralization when the recognition tasks
depend on either configural or featural information. We use
artificial stimuli that consist of three features forming a
triangular configuration, and the features are taken from
letters in the English alphabet. In a configural recognition
task, all stimuli have the same three features („a‟), but their
configurations differ (Figure 4(a)). In contrast, in a featural
recognition task, all stimuli have the same configuration but
the features differ (Figure 4(b)). The model is trained to
recognize the stimuli in the dataset. In the configural tasks,
we examine the effect of stimulus similarity in the dataset
by manipulating the number of possible locations in which a
feature can appear. Similarly, in the featural tasks, we
examine the effect of stimulus similarity in the dataset by
manipulating the number of possible letters appearing in
each feature position. We aim to examine how different
recognition task requirements (configural vs. featural)
modulate holistic processing and hemispheric lateralization
effects and the relationship between the two effects.

featural set; (c) Stimulus design; the three circles indicate
the area of possible positions for each letter. (d) Right and
left damaged images; (e) Top and bottom attenuated images.

Modeling Methods and Results
All images we used were 80x70 pixels having three English
letters as features forming a triangular configuration, with
one letter on the top and the other two on the bottom (Figure
4(c)). In the configural dataset, for each stimulus we fixed
the identity of the letters („a‟), and the position of each letter
was assigned randomly within a circular area of radius 8
pixels (Figure 4(c)). In contrast, in the featural dataset, for
each stimulus we fixed the letter positions and randomly
chose one letter for each position from a fixed set of letters
(i.e. the English alphabet).
To create datasets with different stimulus similarities, in
the configural datasets, we varied the numbers of possible
locations each letter „a‟ could appear within each circular

area. In total we created 9 configural datasets, with the
number of possible locations ranging from 4 to 12. In each
dataset, 26 stimuli were randomly selected from all possible
location combinations. Similarly, we varied the number of
possible letters that could appear in each letter position in
the featural datasets, ranged from 4 to 12, and in total 9
datasets created. In each dataset, 26 stimuli were randomly
selected from all possible feature combinations. In these
datasets, while keeping the total number of stimuli fixed,
increasing the number of possible locations/features made
the stimuli less and less similar to each other (see, e.g.,
Cheung & Hsiao, 2010).
In the simulations, each stimulus had 8 images, each of
which had a different font. We used 4 fonts for training and
the other 4 for testing (counterbalanced across simulation
runs), resulting in a total number of 104 images in each of
the training and testing sets. Thus, we were able to test the
model‟s generalization ability across different fonts.
In the modeling, an input image was first filtered with a
14x12 rigid grid of overlapping 2D Gabor Filters (Daugman,
1985). At each grid point, we applied Gabor filters of 8
orientations and 5 scales (the task-relevant frequency range,
depending on the image size. The maximum frequency
should not exceed 2 pixels per cycle; the 6 th scale, 26 = 64
cycles per image exceeds the maximum frequency of the
images, 70/2 = 35 cycles per image). Thus, each image was
transformed into a vector of size 6,720 (14x12 sample
points x 8 orientation x 5 scales). After obtaining the Gabor
response representations, two conditions were created: (1)
the baseline condition, in which equal weights were given to
different scales of the Gabor responses; (2) the biased
condition, in which we implemented the second stage of the
DFF theory by using a sigmoidal weighting function to bias
the responses on the left half image (RH) to LSFs, and those
on the right half image (LH) to HSFs (Figure 2). The left
and right perceptual representations were then compressed
by PCA separately into a 50-element representation each.
This representation was then used as the input to a two-layer
neural network (See Hsiao et al., 2008 for more details).
We trained the model to recognize the stimuli until the
performance on the training set reached an expert level
(100% accuracy). In the output layer of the neural network,
each output node corresponded to a stimulus identity (thus
there were 26 output nodes). We used gradient descent with
an adaptive learning rate as our training algorithm.
To examine hemispheric lateralization effects, after
training we tested the model with images that had a
damaged RH or LH PCA representation (Figure 2) by
setting the PCA representation to zeros (Figure 4(d)). Thus,
when mapping these damaged images to their identities,
only the information from one of the visual hemifields was
used. The left side (RH) bias was assessed by the accuracy
difference between recognizing a right-side-damaged
stimulus (carrying RH/LSF information) as the original
stimulus and recognizing a left-side-damaged stimulus
(carrying LH/HSF information) as the original one. We
defined RH lateralization (RH/LSF preference, Hsiao et al.,
2008) as the left side bias measured in the biased condition
minus that measured in the baseline condition.

To examine holistic processing effects, after training we
attenuated the Gabor responses of either the top or bottom
half of the images in the test set by multiplying a factor of
0.125 to simulate directing the model‟s attention to the
bottom or top half of the images respectively (Richler et al.,
2007; Figure 4(e)). The complete composite design was
used; it has been shown to be more robust than the partial
composite paradigm (Gauthier & Bukach, 2007; Richler,
Cheung, & Gauthier, in press). We created 4 types of
stimulus pairs corresponding to the 4 conditions shown in
Figure 3. Twenty pairs of images in each condition were
randomly selected to form the materials (80 pairs in total).
We calculated the correlation of the hidden layer
representations in each pair as the similarity measure
between them. A threshold was set to be the midpoint
between the mean correlation of the “same” stimulus pairs
and that of the “different” stimulus pairs. We assumed that
the model responded “same” when the correlation of a pair
was higher than the threshold, and responded “different”
when the correlation was lower than the threshold. The
holistic processing effect was indicated by the
discrimination perfomance difference between the
congruent and incongruent trials measured by d‟.
Configural recognition tasks
The results showed that in all configural tasks, there was a
significant RH lateralization effect (Figure 5(a)).
Nevertheless, RH lateralization did not change significantly
with the number of possible locations each letter could
appear (r = 0.007, n.s.). Figure 5(b) showed the holistic
processing effect (i.e. the difference between the congruent
and incongruent trials) in the biased condition: holistic
processing decreased as the number of possible locations
increased (r = -0.209, p < 0.001). To further explore the
relationship among stimulus similarity, RH lateralization,
and holistic processing, we examined the correlations
among them. We considered the Gabor responses of each
stimulus as a point in a high-dimensional space; the
dissimilarity among stimuli in a dataset was calculated as
the average distance among these points in the space using
the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Means
(UPGMA; see Legendre & Legendre, 1998). The results
showed a positive correlation between RH lateralization and
stimulus dissimilarity: the less similar the stimuli were, the
more RH lateralization the model exhibited (r = 0.437, p <
0.001; Figure 6(a)); in contrast, there was no correlation
between holistic processing and stimulus dissimilarity (r = 0.013, n.s.; Figure 6(b)). There was a weak positive
correlation between holistic processing and RH
lateralization (r = 0.048, p < 0.05; Figure 7(a)). This effect
suggested that when the recognition task mainly relies on
configural information, the more RH lateralization the
model had, the stronger the holistic processing effect the
model exhibited.
Featural recognition tasks
The results showed that in all featural tasks, there was a
significant RH lateralization (Figure 8(a)); this RH

lateralization increased as the number of possible letters in
each letter position increased (r = 0.597, p < 0.001). Figure
8(b) showed the holistic processing effect in the biased
condition: similar to the configural tasks, holistic processing
decreased as the number of possible letters increased.
Regarding the relationship among stimulus similarity, RH
lateralization, and holistic processing, similar to the
configural tasks, there was a positive correlation between
RH lateralization and stimulus dissimilarity (r = 0.600, p <
0.001; Figure 9(a)). In contrast to the configural tasks, there
was a negative correlation between holistic processing and
stimulus dissimilarity: the more similar the stimuli were, the
stronger the holistic processing was (r = -0.256, p < 0.001;
Figure 9(b)); in addition, there was a negative correlation
between holistic processing and RH lateralization: the
weaker the holistic processing was, the stronger the RH
lateralization was (r = -0.211, p < 0.001; Figure 7(b)).

Figure 5: Configural tasks: (a) RH lateralization, (b) Holistic
processing in the biased condition (comparisons with 0 and

Thus, our data suggest that holistic processing (measured
by the composite paradigm) and RH lateralization are

2595

separate processes that do not always go together. More
specifically, the properties of the internal representation
learned by the model can influence holistic processing and
RH lateralization differently, depending on the task
requirements.

Conclusion & Discussion
Holistic processing has long been considered as a property
of RH processing (e.g., Bradshaw & Nettleton, 1981).
Consistent with this view, it has been found that holistic
face processing measured in the composite paradigm is
linked to RH processing (e.g., Schiltz et al., 2010). However,
recent research showed that Chinese character recognition
expertise involves reduced holistic processing and increased
RH lateralization (Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009), suggesting that
holistic processing and RH lateralization may be separate
processes that do not always go together.
Here we investigated the relationship between holistic
processing and RH lateralization in configural and featural
recognition tasks through computational modeling. Our
model implements a theory of hemispheric asymmetry in
perception, the DFF theory, which posits a LSF bias in the
RH and a HSF bias in the LH; this model (or a variant) has
been shown to be able to account for both RH lateralization
and holistic processing in face recognition (e.g., Hsiao et al.,
2008; Cottrell et al., 2002; Richler et al., 2007). Our data
showed that although in both the featural and configural
tasks, RH lateralization decreased with increasing stimulus
similarity, in the featural tasks, holistic processing increased
with increasing stimulus similarity, whereas no correlation
between holistic processing and stimulus similarity was
observed in the configural tasks. In addition, whereas RH

lateralization and holistic processing were positively
correlated in the configural tasks, in the featural tasks this
correlation was negative. This effect suggests that the
internal representation learned by the model in the
recognition tasks has properties that can influence holistic
processing and RH lateralization differently depending on
the task requirements, for example, whether the task
depends on featural or configural information.
This result has important implications for the research on
visual cognition. For example, visual word recognition
relies more on featural processing since configural
information is not important for distinguishing words (e.g.,
Ge et al., 2006); consistent with our modeling data, recent
studies showed that Chinese character recognition expertise
involves RH lateralization and reduced holistic processing
(Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009), whereas English word recognition
expertise involves LH lateralization (e.g., McCandliss,
Cohen, & Dehaene, 2003) and increased holistic processing
(Wong et al., submitted) – a negative correlation between
holistic processing and RH lateralization; this result is
consistent with our data that in the featural recognition tasks
there is a negative correlation between holistic processing
and RH lateralization. In contrast, configural information
has been shown to be more important for face recognition
than the recognition of other types of objects (e.g., Farah et
al., 1998), and thus holistic face processing has been found
to be linked to RH lateralization (e.g., Schiltz et al., 2010),
consistent with our data. Note however that both featural
and configural information may be important for face
recognition (e.g., Rotshtein et al., 2007); our modeling data
suggest that the relationship between RH lateralization and
holistic processing depends on the task requirements. Thus,
Future work will examine the relationship between the two
effects when both featural and configural information are
important for recognition.
Note that holistic processing in visual cognition research
has been measured in different ways; although the
composite paradigm is the most common method, it has also
been measured by, for example, the part-whole paradigm
(Tanaka & Farah, 1993). Whether the effects observed here
can also be observed in other paradigms requires further
examinations. On a similar note, our result is not completely
inconsistent with the holistic/analytic dichotomy proposal in
the hemispheric asymmetry literature, as the definition of
holistic processing can be broad to include concepts such as
global, synthetic, or gestalt processing (e.g., Bradshaw &
Nettleton, 1981). Nevertheless, our result suggests that a
better description of RH processing may be needed.
In summary, in contrast to the well-accepted proposal that
holistic processing is a property of RH processing, our
modeling data suggest that holistic processing (measured by
the composite paradigm) and RH lateralization are separate
processes that do not always go together, depending on the
task requirements.
