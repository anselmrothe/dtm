Abstract
Are numerals divorced from a sense of the actual quantities
they represent? We show that accessing a sense of how much
a numerical symbol actually represents is a surprisingly
difficult and non-trivial process. Irrespective of numerical
size or distance, direct comparison of the relative quantities
represented by symbolic and non-symbolic quantities leads to
performance markedly worse than when comparing two nonsymbolic quantities. Experiment 2 shows that this effect
cannot be attributed to differences in perceptual processing
streams. Experiment 3 shows that there is no additional cost
of mixing two formats that are both symbolic; that is, the
decrement in mixing formats is specific to mixing symbolic
and non-symbolic representations. Our data are consistent
with the view that numerical symbols operate primarily as an
associative system in which relations between symbols come
to overshadow those between symbols and their quantity
referents.
Keywords: Numerical Cognition; Symbolic Representation.

Introduction
Does one really have a meaningful sense of very large
quantities, like a million or a billion? Or does representing
quantities in exact, symbolic form come to change the way
we think about (and with) these numerical symbols
themselves? In recent years, evidence has accumulated in
favor of a strong overlap between symbolic and nonsymbolic number-representation systems (Dehaene, 1997,
2008; Dehaene et al., 2003; Nieder & Dehane, 2009; Piazza
et al., 2007, 2010; Fias et al., 2003; Condry & Spelke, 2008;
McCrink & Spelke 2010; Gilmore et al., 2010; Halberda et
al., 2010; Santens et al., 2010). Considerable attention has
been paid to the notion that complex mathematical concepts
are grounded in an evolutionarily ancient and
developmentally fundamental sense of quantity (e.g., which
basket contains more apples, which tribe comprises more
members, which of two bushes contains more berries?)
(Nieder & Dehaene, 2009; Halberda et al., 2008; Pica et al.,
2004). Furthermore, this view proposes that an intuitive
sense of approximate quantity (i.e., the approximate number
system – ANS) should be a fundamental aspect of any

numerical symbol – that is, there should be considerable
overlap between symbolic and non-symbolic numerical
processes (Dehaene, 2008). Thus, accessing this sense of
quantity from a symbol should be a relatively fast and
effortless process.
On the other hand, it may be that through repeated use
and mastery of numerical symbols, the ties between exact
numerical symbols (e.g., Arabic numerals) are weakened to
the point that these symbols are often used with very little
access to a sense of the actual quantities they presumably
represent. For example, it is hard to conjure a sense of what
a million actually looks or feels like – one’s intuitive sense
of what 1,000,000 actually means seems divorced from the
symbol that is meant to represent that quantity. Of course,
we can still use 1,000,000 in myriad ways; for example, it
should be easy enough to understand that 999,999 <
1,000,000 < 1,000,001. In other words, the symbol
1,000,000 makes perfect sense in terms of its relative
(ordinal) position with respect to other numerical symbols
(Verguts & Fias, 2004), even if it is possibly divorced from
the quantity it represents.
In sum, a crucial facet of numerical symbols is how they
relate to other symbols; indeed, it may even be the case that
with repeated exposure to numerical symbols, symbolsymbol relations in literate adults come to usurp symbolquantity relations. As has been found in abstract semantic
representation more generally (Crutch & Warrington, 2010),
how a (numerical) symbol relates to other symbols may thus
become more central to that symbol’s meaning than how it
relates to the quantity it supposedly represents (Deacon,
1997; Nieder, 2009). If so, then eliciting a sense of the
actual quantity represented by a numerical symbol may be
an onerous process, in that it is not typically necessary when
using such symbols in a normal mathematical context. That
is, the link between numerical symbols and the quantities
they represent (at least in terms of the ANS) may actually be
considerably weaker than previously assumed.
One way to distinguish these hypotheses directly is to ask
participants to use numerical symbols in a context that
forces them to access how much a given symbol represents

1515

explicitly. In the current study, we asked participants to
compare quantities represented either in symbolic (Arabic
numeral or written number-word) or non-symbolic format
(an array of dots flashed too briefly to be counted). In
Experiments 1-2, we had adult participants make
comparison judgments (decide which item depicts the
greater quantity) in three different conditions:
numeral/numeral judgments, dot/dot judgments, and mixed
dot/numeral (or numeral/dot) judgments. In Experiment 3,
participants compared quantities in numeral-numeral,
number-word/number-word, and number-word/numeral (or
numeral/number-word) conditions.
If numerical symbols retain a strong link to an
approximate sense of the quantities they represent, then
mixing formats should be akin to comparing two entities
that ostensibly differ only in representational quality (i.e.,
sharpness of approximate tuning curves; Piazza et al., 2004;
Nieder & Merten, 2007). Adults are faster and more
accurate when comparing two numeral-stimuli than two dotstimuli (Buckley & Gillman, 1974; Lyons & Beilock, 2009).
Thus, replacing one dot-stimulus with a (superior) numeralstimulus should improve mixed-format comparison (relative
to dot-dot comparison) performance. According to the
hypothesis that symbolic and non-symbolic quantities draw
from the same neural populations (Dehaene, 2008; Santens,
2010), mixed-format comparisons (which combine a
broadly tuned dot-stimulus with a finely tuned numeralstimulus) in Experiments 1-2 should yield performance
somewhere in between that of numeral-numeral (two finely
tuned stimuli) and dot-dot comparisons (two broadly tuned
stimuli); or more conservatively, mixed performance should
at least be no worse than dot-dot comparisons.

By contrast, if symbolic numbers have become detached
from an intuitive sense of the non-symbolic quantities to
which they presumably refer, accessing this sense of
quantity directly from a numerical symbol may incur an
additional processing cost. According to this hypothesis,
mixed-format comparisons should lead to performance
significantly worse than either numeral-numeral or dot-dot
comparisons.
In Experiment 3, we tested whether the potential cost of
mixing formats observed in Experiments 1 and 2 might
simply be due to mixing representational or visual format,
rather than to asymmetric accessing of quantity information.
We expected quantities presented as number words to be
represented symbolically, as in the case of numerals. We
thus predicted that directly comparing a numeral with a
number-word should not yield performance worse than
number-word/number-word comparisons (which were
expected to yield less efficient performance than numeralnumeral comparisons; Damian, 2004). Such a result would
suggest that the performance degradation seen for mixed
comparisons is not simply due to mixing representational or
visual formats.

Methods
In Experiment 1 (N=21 University of Chicago students),
subjects decided which of two simultaneously presented
visual stimuli (dots and/or numerals) was numerically larger
(Figure 1a-c). In Experiment 2 (N=21 Dartmouth College
students), the two stimuli (dots and/or numerals) were
presented sequentially (Figure 1d-f). In Experiment 3 (N=21
University of Chicago students), stimuli (numerals and/or
number-words) were presented sequentially (timing was the
same as in Experiment 2).

Figure 1
Figure 1 shows stimulus
examples from Exps. 1
[a-c] and 2 [d-f] (Exp. 3
trial timing was the
same as in Exp. 2). Note
that for DD trials, the
two dot-arrays in a
given comparison trial
were
equated
with
respect to two of four
continuous parameters
(individual
dot-size,
total dot-area, inter-item
density, total array
perimeter), such that,
across all trials, relying
exclusively on any one
of these parameters
would
lead
to
performance no better
than chance. No array
was ever presented to a
subject twice.

1516

In all Experiments, subjects’ task was to decide which
stimulus represented the greater quantity (Figure 1 depicts
sample trials). In Experiments 1-2, there were three format
conditions: numeral/numeral (NN), dot/dot (DD), mixedformat (MX) numeral/dot (or dot/numeral). In Experiment
3, there were three format conditions: numeral/numeral
(NN), number-word/number-word (WW), mixed-format
(MX) numeral/number-word (or number-word/numeral.
Trials were always blocked by condition (with rest and
instructions between blocks), so participants always knew
which presentation-order to expect. The order of conditionblocks was randomized across participants. For MX trials in
Experiment 1, which side (left or right) contained the dotarray was randomized across trials. For MX trials in
Experiments 2 and 3, which stimulus-type was presented
first in was also balanced across trials. Subjects were to
press a key with their left middle finger if they thought the
left (Experiment 1) or first (Experiments 2-3) stimulus was
greater, press a key with their right middle finger if they
thought the right (Experiment 1) or second (Experiments 23) stimulus was greater, or press a third key (space bar) with
both index fingers if they thought the two stimuli were
numerically equal (catch trials).
In all experiments, there were 48 critical trials and 16
catch trials in each condition. In all conditions, half of
critical trials were numerically small (1,2,3,4), and half were
large (10,20,30,40); orthogonally, half of critical trials were
numerically close (|n1–n2| = 1 or 10) and half were far (|n1–
n2| = 2,3,20 or 30). In this way, for each format condition,
stimuli were subdivided into four categories: small-far,
small-close, large-far, large-close. Performance differences
were tested within each of these categories separately: all
contrasts were two-tailed, within-subjects contrasts with 20
degrees of freedom.

Figure 2

Results
In all experiments, two behavioral measures were
collected: response-times (RTs) and error-rates (ERs). RT
and ER condition means are summarized in Table 1.
Contrast results for RTs are shown in Figure 2. In all
experiments, our hypotheses concerned the difference
between the MX and the single-format condition (NN, DD
or WW) that yielded the worst performance in that
experiment.
In Experiment 1, RTs tended to be longer on DD than NN
trials (large-close: p=.056; large-far: p=.245; small-close:
p=.001; small-far: p=.138). ERs were higher on DD close
(ps<.001) but not far (ps≥.336) trials. This result is
unsurprising in that performance on numerical comparisons
using symbols is typically better than on comparisons using
non-symbolic quantities (e.g., arrays of dots) (Buckley &
Gillman, 1974; Lyons & Beilock, 2009). Thus, our critical
contrasts were between MX and DD trials. RTs were
significantly longer for MX than DD trials in all categories
(all ps<.001; Figure 2a). ERs were higher for MX than DD
trials in all four categories as well (large-close: p=.137;
large-far: p<.001; small-close: p=.023; small-far: p=.014).

Figure 2 shows the cost – in milliseconds – of mixing
formats. Red error bars are 95% confidence intervals. For
Experiments 1-2, the y-axis is the mean difference between
MX and DD conditions (white bars) and MX and NN
conditions (black bars). The critical contrast (see text) was
between MX and DD conditions. For Experiment 3, the yaxis is the mean difference between MX and WW
conditions (grey bars) and MX and NN conditions (black
bars). The critical contrast (see text) was between MX and
WW conditions. Terms and abbreviations are the same as
in Figure 1. Raw cell means for both response-times and
error-rates can be found in Table 1.

In sum, RTs were significantly longer for MX than DD
trials (and ERs showed a similar pattern). Accessing a sense
of quantity entails additional processing costs over and
above typical numerical or dot comparisons and thus does
not appear to be an automatically accessible aspect of
symbolic number representation.
However, it may be that the difference between DD and
MX performance arises, not because of a weak link between
the ANS and numerical symbols, but due to the cost of
switching between different perceptual input streams (in the
case of MX trials) (Dehaene et al., 2003; Santens, 2010;
Dehaene & Cohen, 1995). In Experiment 1, (simultaneous
presentation), the average difference between DD and
MX conditions in terms of response-times was 370msec,
with the maximum difference arising for large-close trials
(M=426msec, Figure 2a). Thus, in Experiments 2-3, we
chose an inter-trial-interval (ITI) that far exceeded (roughly
doubled) this potential switch-cost window (700msec; total
time between stimulus 1 and 2 onsets: 850msec; see Figure
1). In addition, 850msec is also well in excess of the
maximum duration typically observed in visual attentional
blink paradigms (Raymond et al., 1992; Kranczioch et al.,
2005), which further reduces the possibility that any effect
of mixing formats in Experiments 2-3 would be due to
switching between input processing streams. Note that a still
longer ISI was not chosen to avoid placing undue demands
on working-memory maintenance processes.
In Experiment 2, RTs tended to be longer on DD than NN
trials (large-close: p=.078; small-close: p=.111; small-far:
p=.099), with the exception of large-far trials, which
showed a trend in the opposite direction (p=.178). ERs were
higher on DD than NN large-close trials (p<.001) but not in
any other category (ps≥.329). Thus, excepting large-far
trials, our critical contrasts were between MX and DD trials.
Note that in Experiment 2, MX trials could be presented
either dot-first (DN) or numeral-first (ND). The main effect
of presentation-order and all interaction terms involving this
factor were non-significant for both RTs and ERs (all
Fs<1); Experiment 2 MX results were thus collapsed across
presentation-orders.

RTs were significantly longer for MX than DD trials in all
categories (all ps≤.006; Figure 2b); RTs were also
significantly longer for MX than NN trials in all categories
(all ps≤.001; Table 1b). ERs tended to be higher for MX
than DD trials as well (large-close: p=.144; large-far:
p=.001; small-close: p=.084; small-far: p=.046). In sum,
RTs were significantly longer for MX than DD and NN
trials (and ERs showed a similar pattern). The results from
Experiment 2 thus provide further evidence that accessing a
sense of quantity entails an additional processing cost,
beyond any cost of switching between different perceptual
input streams that may have been observed in Experiment 1.
In Experiment 3, we tested whether the potential cost of
mixing formats observed in Experiments 1 and 2 might be
due to mixing visual format. In contrast to the MX
conditions above, we predicted that mixing symbolic visual
formats (numerals and number-words) would not lead to
performance significantly worse than that seen for the
worst-performing single-format condition (NN or WW).
Quantities used and other parameters were the same as in
Experiment 2. Number-words were presented in English in
the center of the screen (24-point Arial font).
In Experiment 3, responses on WW trials tended to be
slower than on NN trials (large-close: p<.001; large-far:
p=.072; small-close: p=.145; small-far: p=.203). ERs were
higher on WW than NN large-close trials (p=.047) but not
in any other category (ps≥.605). Thus, our critical contrasts
were between MX and WW trials.
Crucially, performance did not significantly differ
between MX and WW conditions for either RTs (all
ps≥.390) or ERs (all ps≥.636). In sum, Experiment 3 results
are consistent with the hypothesis that switching between
visual numerical formats – so long as both formats point to
symbolic representations – does not incur the same cost that
arises when switching between symbolic and non-symbolic
numerical formats, as was seen in Experiments 1 and 2.

Discussion
Experiments 1 and 2 provide clear evidence that
numerical comparisons between a symbolic and a nonsymbolic quantity are considerably more difficult than
comparing two non-symbolic quantities. This is surprising
in that one might expect the comparison of a highly accurate
stimulus (numeral) and an inaccurate stimulus (dot-array) to
be easier (or at least no worse) than comparison of two
inaccurate stimuli (two dot-arrays). Our data reject this view
and suggest instead that symbolic numbers do not provide
automatic access to an approximate sense of the quantity
that they represent. Rather, it appears that additional,
seemingly inefficient processing is required to compare
symbolic with non-symbolic quantities.
Interestingly, MX performance was worse than DD
performance even for small numbers. First, this indicates
that inefficiency of directly comparing symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers is present even for highly familiar
quantities. Furthermore, the small numbers used here (1-4)
are within the subitizing range for adults (Mandler & Shebo,
1982; Revkin et al., 2008; Demeyere et al., 2010). Nonsymbolic quantities in this range tend to be represented in
exact (as opposed to approximate) fashion since they do not
exceed the limited capacity of visual short-term memory
(Luck & vogel, 1997; Pylyshyn, 2001; Ansari et al., 2007).
Inefficient mixed-format comparisons for small quantities
suggests that neither familiarity nor representational acuity
(i.e. sharpness of approximate tuning curves; Piazza et al.,
2004; Nieder & Merten, 2007) is the primary cause of this
cost. Instead, it appears that symbolic and non-symbolic
representations of quantity are incompatible seemingly
across the board.
At a theoretical level, our results are partially consistent
with the place-code model of symbolic number
representation proposed by Verguts and Fias (2004), in
which a numerical symbol is represented in terms of its
relative ordinal position. Our results go beyond this model,
however, in that they suggest that numerical symbols
operate primarily as an associative system in which relations
between symbols come to overshadow those between
symbols and their quantity referents, and may even become
devoid of a strong sense of quantity per se (Deacon, 1997;
Nieder, 2009). Thus, an important step for future research
will be to understand symbolic representation of number in
a way that is not necessarily tied explicitly to actual quantity
referents. This may be especially interesting to consider in a
developmental context and with respect to the individual
differences that limit exactly how and when numerical
symbols are best understood in conjunction with or separate
from one’s more intuitive number sense (Lyons & Beilock,
2009; Santens et al., 2010; Ansari, 2008; Holloway &
Ansari, 2010).
Here it is important to note that one potentially simple
explanation for the current results is that number sense and
numerical symbols were simply never associated with one
another in the first place. We do not believe this to be the

case, however, for two important reasons. First,
considerable neural evidence has accrued suggesting that the
neural substrates underlying the ANS do overlap at least to
some extent with those thought to underlie symbolic
representations of number (Dehaene et al., 2003; Nieder &
Dehane, 2009; Piazza et al., 2007; Fias et al., 2003; Santens
et al., 2010). Furthermore, recent developmental evidence
suggests that individual differences in ANS acuity are
linked with symbol-based math abilities from a relatively
young age (Piazza et al., 2010; McCrink & Spelke 2010;
Gilmore et al., 2010; Halberda et al., 2010). Therefore, our
assertion is that, perhaps via years of practice with and overlearned associations between symbols, these representations
may have become functionally distinguishable from the
ANS, at least in that the link between symbol and quantity
has been weakened or perhaps relegated to a more indirect
status. In conclusion, the data reported here plainly call into
question the strength of the link between numerical symbols
and a sense of the quantities they are meant to represent in
literate adults. Therefore, future studies aimed at
understanding the cognitive and neural basis of more
complex math skills in particular should consider not only
the commonalities across systems, but also the unique
properties that symbolic representations of number bring to
the table.
