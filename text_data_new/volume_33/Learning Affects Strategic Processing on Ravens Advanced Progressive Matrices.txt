Abstract: Eye-movement patterns contain important information about strategic information processing. Using
the successor representation (SR, Dayan, 1993, Neural Computation) to capture statistical regularities in temporally
extended fixation sequences we were able to assess strategic shifts in eye-movement patterns and predict scores
on Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) test. Thirty-five participants completed two subsets of APM
items on two separate days. Principal-component analysis of the SRs revealed individual differences in scanning
patterns. The strongest principal component quantified the tendency to systematically scan the Raven matrix by
rows; another component quantified the tendency to toggle to and from the response area. Leave-one-out cross
validation demonstrated that these two components predicted 41
