Abstract
Researchers disagree on the relationships between gender,
spatial ability and math achievement. Varied results from
studies using different measures and populations fuel the
debate. The present study adds to the gender-spatial-math
literature by examining this relationship in the context of
high-stakes math testing. Results indicate no gender effect on
spatial ability or math achievement, and a spatial/math
relationship that is eliminated once ELA covariates are
introduced.
Keywords: spatial ability, gender, math achievement,
education.

Background
The area of gender differences in mathematics is a contested
topic. Depending on the measures used and populations
evaluated, researchers have found widely differing results
(Friedman, 1995; Hyde, Fennema, & Lamon, 1990). Most
gender differences are found among older children and with
tests implicating higher-order mathematical thinking and are
especially prominent among highly selective or
academically advanced samples (Geary, 2000; Hyde,
Fennema, & Lamon, 1990; Lachance & Mazzocco, 2006).
Among researchers that do find a gender difference in
math achievement, the search for the root of this difference
often leads them to the idea of a spatial ability mediator
(e.g., Casey, Nutall, & Pezaris, 2001). This mediator model
has been adopted by many in the policy community and is
relied upon in calling for educators to utilize spatial thinking
toward advancing learning outcomes (AAUW, 2010;
Committee on Support for Thinking Spatially, 2006,
NCTM, 2000). Much research has been done to illuminate
the specifics of these relationships, but has been met with
inconsistent results.
In considering which measures of spatial cognition were
most related to gender, Linn and Petersen (1985) found that
tests of mental rotation produced the largest male advantage.
Friedman’s (1995) meta-analysis all but dismissed the
gender-spatial-math relationship as folklore, but noted that
spatial abilities may work differently for males and females,
especially among higher-ability groups. Casey, Nutall and
Pezaris (2001) attempted to tease apart the types of math

problems most related to spatial ability and gender, a
proposition that other researchers have supported—many
identifying more complex mathematical problem solving as
displaying a male or high-spatial-performer advantage
(Floyd, Evans, & McGrew, 2003; Geary, 2000).
Researchers such as Voyer and Sullivan (2003) have
emphasized the need to consider relevant control variables
to avoid the suppression of an effect on or of spatial ability.
For example, Johnson and Meade (1987) note that female
verbal precocity may mask a male advantage in spatial
ability among younger children. The same call for relevant
control variables is used to prevent the overestimation of
spatial-gender or spatial-mathematics relationships (Floyd,
Evans, & McGrew, 2003; Friedman, 1995). Failure to
include variables measuring an underlying ability related to
both spatial cognition and math achievement may indicate a
false relationship.
In the above examples and others, exploring genderspatial-math relationships has been done with grades (e.g.,
Voyer & Sullivan, 2003), non-classroom-related tests of
math achievement, such as the Woodcock Johnson III (e.g.,
Taub, 2008), and adapted standardized tests (e.g., Casey,
Nutall, & Pezaris, 2001). Within the current educational
conscience, greater utility might be found from exploring
these relationships among measures of achievement more
relevant to today’s schools. Since the No Child Left Behind
act of 2002, much of the emphasis in American classrooms
has been on standardized tests. These exams have real-world
consequences for students, teachers and schools. Strands
within these assessments often address math problems
thought to be directly (measurement, geometry) or indirectly
related to spatial thinking (Committee on Support for
Thinking Spatially, 2006). Policy-makers and educators rely
on these exams to make important decisions and treat scores
as representative of actual student math achievement.
The goal of this paper is to contribute to the research on
gender, spatial ability, and mathematics by examining these
relationships on a practical and “high-stakes" indicator, the
California Standards Test (CSTs). To explore whether this
relationship differs depending on type of problem, CST
cluster scores relating to different strands of mathematical
skills are also investigated.

Methods
Participants
Participants in this study were drawn from a larger study on
the effects of an interactive mathematics software (ST
Math), which included all second through fifth graders in 52
schools across two treatment conditions. The schools were
located in Orange County, California and were
predominately Latino with large percentages of English
Language Learners. The average percentage of students on
free or reduced price lunch among the study schools was
over 80%. Further information on the study design is
available in Rutherford et al. (2010).
A sample of students was randomly selected from all
grades and schools to participate in individual testing. 547
students ranging in age from 89 to 146 months were
administered individual assessments (53% male, 77%
Latino, 83% on free/reduced lunch, 58% English Language
Learners, 17% identified as gifted/talented). One special
education student was excluded from the present analysis
because he took an alternative assessment for his state
standardized test. Up to an additional 49 students were
excluded from certain analyses because of missing data on
one or more measure. These students do not differ
significantly in any measured way from those that were
included in the analyses.

Measures
Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, Third
Edition The Block Rotation subtest (Test 28) on the
Diagnostic Supplement to the Woodcock-Johnson Test of
Cognitive Abilities (WJ-III COG) was administered as a
measure of spatial processing abilities. Block Rotation was
chosen for its similarity to the Vandenberg and Kuse (1978)
test that Linn and Petersen specified as most likely to have a
relationship with gender (1985). The WJ-III is an
individually administered, norm-referenced measure of
cognitive processing, based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
(CHC) theory of intelligence. The WJ-III Diagnostic
Supplement was standardized on the same norming sample
as the core battery of the WJ-III Tests of Cognitive
Abilities, consisting of over 8800 individuals located in over
100 geographically diverse communities in the United
States, with participants ranging in age from 24 months to
90 years (McGrew & Woodcock, 2001). Raw scores,
standard score, and percentile ranks were obtained using the
WJ-III Normative Update scoring software, which
represents a recalculation of the original norms based on the
2000 U.S. census data. On this task, participants were asked
to match two, rotated three-dimensional patterns from an
array to a target picture. The reported alpha of Block
Rotation is 0.84 (McGrew & Woodcock, 2001).
Among the students in our study, performance on this
measure was comparable, but slightly higher than the
publisher's norming sample (McGrew & Woodcock, 2001),
with a mean standardized score of 103.44 (SD= 14.53) and a
range from 39 to 149.

The California Standards Tests (CSTs) Administered to
students in grades 2 through 11 attending California public
schools, these tests are aligned to the state content standards
and intended to measure math skills important for future
mathematical success (California Standards, 2010).
California chose its math content standards based on
recommendations from the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics (2000)—recommendations used by many other
states in crafting their own standards and assessments (e.g.,
Massachusetts, 2011), and the National Research Council
(2010), which stresses abstract thinking and higher-order
math problem solving. The math portion of the CSTs is
divided into five different reporting/clustering strands, two
of which are associated with Number Sense. The other three
stands include Algebra and Functions, Measurement and
Geometry, and Statistics, Data Analysis, and Probability.
The English-Language Arts portion of the CSTs consists
of 65 questions spanning five reporting/clustering strands:
Word Analysis, Reading Comprehension, Literary Response
and Analysis, Writing Strategies, and Writing Conventions.
Each domain of the CSTs yields an overall scaled score out
of a possible 600 points, which is normed relative to grade
level and percentage of problems correct for each of the
clusters within the domain.
Student Demographics Information on gender, free lunch
(as a measure of SES), English Learner and gifted status
were collected and provided by the districts with the CST
information.

Procedure
Each participant was escorted from their classroom during
the school day to participate in individual testing. The
purpose of the study was explained and students were given
a chance to assent or decline to participate. Those who
assented were given two math subtests within the WJ-III
Test of Achievement along with block rotation and a
measure of math motivation. Testing was conducted one-onone by trained graduate and undergraduate students and
lasted between 30 and 60 minutes. At the end of the testing
session students were escorted back to their classrooms.

Results
No significant association between gender and spatial ability
emerged within the data. Figure 1 displays mean spatial
scores by gender across grade level. Although at each grade
level there are slight differences in spatial ability between
boys and girls, and it appears that after second grade girls
decline in performance relative to boys, none of these
differences are significant. Previous studies (see Hyde,
Fennema, & Lamon, 1990; Lachance & Mazocco, 2006)
have focused on the percentage differences between boys
and girls among groups above/below the mean of spatial
scores or in the highest vs lowest quartile. This analysis
procedure may give a more interpretable result as to the
capacity for advanced study in higher math and sciences.

With this in mind, Table 1 shows the percent of boys and
girls by grade in the highest quartile of spatial ability.
Results follow no obvious trend with respect to grade-level.
To test the hypothesis supported in Johnson and Meade
(1987) and directly advanced by Voyer and Sullivan (2003)
that spatial ability is more related to verbal ability than
gender, regression analysis was performed. Spatial ability
was regressed on gender, control covariates, and prior
English Language Arts achievement score. Relationship
between gender and spatial ability remained insignificant
(regression results available on file with authors).
Figure 2 shows a gender comparison of math scores over
grade. Scale scores provided by the California Department
of Education were used to compare scores across grades.
Boys transition from scoring below the mean score for girls
to scoring above somewhere between third and fourth grade,
but no differences are statistically significant.

To determine associations between gender, spatial ability,
and achievement test scores, correlations were computed as
shown in Table 2. Scale scores were available only for
composite math and ELA achievement scores, and raw
scores available for each subtest varied between grade-level.
To account for differences in numbers of items, z scores
were created from raw scores within each grade for each
subscore and for both composites. In this way, each
student’s z score reflects their relative position to other
students in their grade—only students taking the same test
with the same items are compared. These z scores are used
in the correlations shown and in subsequent regression
analyses.

Scale Score

Significant correlations exist between spatial ability and
almost all achievement scores, including ELA scores. The
one math subscore that did not show a relationship with
spatial ability is the Statistics and Probability cluster, which
involves the analysis and interpretation of data in various
forms, including visual representations. As might be
expected from the descriptive statistics and figures, gender
(male) is not correlated with spatial or math scores within
our sample, but is negatively correlated with the ELA
composite score, suggesting a female advantage in the
subject.
To further explore the relationship between spatial ability
and mathematics achievement, student position in spatial
ability quartile was compared with the CST composite math
score. Figure 3 illustrates differences in math achievement
between high and low performers on the spatial ability
measure, but none of these differences reach significance,
nor do the gaps widen with age as would be suggested from
studies such as those reviewed in Hyde, Fennema, and
Lamon (1990).
Zero-order correlations can under- or overestimate the
relationship between two variables (Voyer & Sullivan,
2003). To determine a truer estimate of the relationship
between spatial ability and different math clusters,
regression analysis was employed. Separate regressions
were run for math composite score and four CST math
clusters for second through fifth graders. Because topics in
clusters one and two, both labeled “Number Sense,” varied
between grades, a composite one/two cluster was created
from scores on both of these clusters and z scored as an
aggregated unit for each grade. To account for differences
between grades, grade-level fixed effects were employed so
that coefficients represented the mean effect across grade.
Standard errors were adjusted by clustering on school site.
Table 3 shows stepwise regression results for math
composite score. Interactions of spatial ability with gender,
grade, age relative to grade-level peers, ST Math use, gifted
and English Language Learner statuses were tested with
ANOVA and found to be non-significant and were therefore
not included in these analyses. In the initial equation, spatial
ability has a significant relationship with math composite
score which diminishes as covariates are added to the
model.
Once English Language Arts composite score is added to
the model, the relationship between spatial ability and math
score is reduced to insignificance and declines from an
effect size of .14 to .08 (coefficient divided by RMSE for
each model as specified in Brooksgunn, Liaw, & Klebanov,
1992). All other cluster scores behave similarly except for
Statistics/Probability, which has a more modest relationship
reduced to insignificance with the addition of only
demographic covariates. Final models for each cluster group
are shown in models five through eight in Table 3.

Discussion
Bolstering the idea that gender differences are not apparent
in elementary-aged children, we failed to find any sex
advantage for either spatial ability or math achievement.
Researchers in the area of spatial abilities struggle with
consistent definitions of constructs and uniformity of
measures, and this no doubt has a great impact on the
variability in results; however, that we found this null
relationship with a test of mental rotation, the test thought to
be most highly related to gender (Linn & Petersen, 1985), is
an illuminating contribution. Our failure to find a difference
between boys and girls can be interpreted in a number of
ways. As other researchers have suggested, sex differences
may be diminishing over generations (Lachance &
Mazzocco, 2006), or may not appear or appear only
inconsistently in younger populations (Hyde, Fennema, &
Lamon, 1990). Our data indicate no gender differences as
the participants approach 12, an age below that at which
earlier studies had detected gender differences (e.g. Linn &
Petersen, 1985).
Previous speculation has been controversial as to whether
controlling for spatial ability would increase (Voyer &
Sullivan, 2003) or decrease (Hyde, Geiringer, & Yen, 1975)
the relationship between gender and mathematics. Within
our data, adding a spatial ability control did little either way
to the association between gender and mathematics. As with
the gender and spatial ability results, the variation in
measure may have contributed to this finding: different test
items and testing conditions may no doubt display different
relationships to gender. However, the use of a broad math
measure incorporating varied levels and topics in
mathematics adds validity to our findings.

Apart from the gender question, spatial ability itself has
been thought to relate strongly to higher math and sciences
and to be integral to the development of our nation’s 21st
century competitive workforce (Committee on Support for
Thinking Spatially, 2006). Drawing on these ideas,
educators, researchers and those with influence on policy
have called for the development of spatial thinking in our
children, including those in elementary school (Committee
on Support for Thinking Spatially, 2006; NCTM, 2000).
The belief in a firm spatial/math connection at all ages
supports these goals, but has been erratically demonstrated
in the literature. While a more robust relationship has been
found between spatial ability and older students, this
relationship often pales when compared to the relationship
between verbal and mathematical achievement (Friedman,
1995). Among the young students in the present study, the
spatial/math relationship is all but completely attenuated by
the addition of a verbal (ELA) control variable to the
regression models. Granted, state standardized assessments
such as the CSTs were not developed to test spatial ability
or likely even those technical skills required in many
spatially-related math and science careers. However, such
high-stakes tests focus on the skills and areas policy-makers
have deemed important to our developing workforce
(Committee on Support for Thinking Spatially, 2006;
NCLB, 2002), and these tests have been theorized to include
clusters and problems related to spatial skills, even at the
young ages included in this study (Committee on Support
for Thinking Spatially, 2006).

If spatial abilities are not significantly related to skills
assessed in high-stakes tests such as the CSTs, perhaps the
tests themselves are flawed. If spatial thinking is a skill that
is valuable and necessary for future innovation and
competence in mathematics, it appears that state
standardized tests are missing a critical assessment of our
children’s progress toward contributing to our nation.
And what of the diminishing relationship of spatial ability
and math once an ELA measure is included? The influence
of spatial ability on math may be merely the result of an
underlying academic skill such as following directions,
attentional control, or working memory. As students age,
perhaps these underlying abilities are parceled out and
specialize into spatial and language-analytic components.
Research using targeted measures and a wide range of
student ages is better-suited to answer this question.
Looking forward, there may be analyses that can find the
link between gender, spatial ability, and math within certain
standardized test problems, such as those that target
complex problem solving, an area more strongly associated
with gender and spatial ability (Geary, 2000). Because the
structure of the CSTs embeds problem solving within all
five math clusters, it was difficult to isolate this skill. Our
study presents initial evidence that both educational goals
and assessments thought to invoke spatial ability may be off
the mark, more focused research can indicate how and when
these areas can be better aligned or can indicate other
cognitive building blocks more highly related to math
achievement.
