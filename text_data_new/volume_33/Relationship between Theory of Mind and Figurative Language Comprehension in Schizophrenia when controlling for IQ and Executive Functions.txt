Abstract: In a previous study (Gavilán & Garcı́a-Albea, 2009) 23 schizophrenic patients and 23 healthy controls
were assessed in Theory of Mind (ToM) and Figurative Language Comprehension (FLC) abilities in order to explore
the functional relationship between both capacities. We used 3 ToM and 3 FLC tasks. We found that ToM correlated
high and significantly with FLC only in the group of patients. In the present study we aim to identify whether the
association found in patients between ToM and FLC was genuine or it is better explained by impairments in general
intelligence and/or executive functions. For that purpose, the same sample was assessed using a short form of the
WAIS-III-R in order to estimate their IQ, and 7 Executive Functions (EF) tests to estimate their executive integrity.
Results show that the correlation between ToM and FLC capacities remains significant when controlling either for
IQ, or when controlling for EF.
