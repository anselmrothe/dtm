Abstract

study categorization in natural language categories. The list
of items that is presented for categorization is generally a mix
of clear members, borderline members, and clear nonmembers of the target category. However, even the clear nonmembers of the target category in these tasks are chosen to
be at least somewhat related to the category’s most prototypical items. For instance, the nonmembers included for categorization in a category like vegetables tend to be comprised
of other food or plant items. Employing items from the animals or artifacts domains instead, would presumably render
the task less ecological valid and (perhaps more to the point)
might detract from the similarity-based processes we intend
to study with these tasks. Importantly, when all the items that
make up a set of potential category members are drawn from
a single domain (be it animals, artifacts, foods, activities, ...)
it is likely that meaningful similarity relations exist among
them. These similarity relations might impose structure on
the corresponding categorization decisions that have been neglected in treating these decisions as independent from one
another. For instance, in categorizing items as vegetables or
not, one can imagine participants consistently giving the same
response to parsley as to sage when their similarity as herbs
is recognized.
In what follows we will employ various methods to establish that the data that result from the traditional categorization
task violate the assumption of independence. These methods originate from the item response models literature, where
departures from independence are known as Local Item Dependencies (LIDs). Rather than considering LIDs as nuisances that one is better off eliminating (which is common
practice in the item response models literature), we will relate the LIDs to ratings of item-item similarity to argue that
they are a substantial part of categorization decisions which
future accounts of categorization will have to incorporate.
The case for the existence and importance of LIDs in categorization will be made by means of a reanalysis of previously published categorization data using the Rasch model
(Rasch, 1960). The reasons for using the Rasch model to
introduce one of the shortcomings of many current categorization accounts are threefold. (i) The model naturally accounts for the inter-individual differences in categorization
that are characteristic of the natural language categories we
study (Verheyen, Hampton, & Storms, 2010). (ii) Since the
Rasch model is an item response model it is straightforward
to apply existing methods for detecting LIDs to it. (iii) A
Rasch-like model that accommodates the need to incorporate
LIDs offers the intriguing possibility of deriving similarity
from categorization, instead of the other way around.

Most accounts of categorization assume the categorization decision for an item to be independent of the categorization decisions for other items. A number of methods are brought to
bear on the question of whether this assumption is justified.
These methods involve the application of a formal categorization model that explicitly incorporates the independence assumption to categorization data and the subsequent investigation of the residuals for unexplained structure. The residuals
reveal multiple departures from independence, suggesting that
the independence assumption in many a categorization account
should be relaxed. Following this suggestion the applied formal model is extended to allow for dependent categorization
decisions. It is explained how the extended model might address the concern that categorization accounts have erred in
using similarity as an explanatory construct. It promises to be
a significant step towards a categorization-based model of similarity.
Keywords: categorization; similarity; threshold theory.

Introduction
Similarity is arguably the variable that is most often invoked
to explain categorization decisions. According to most accounts of categorization an item is believed to be a category
member if its representation sufficiently resembles the category representation (regardless of whether the latter is believed to be an abstracted summary representation, an instantiated set of representative exemplars, an ideal, or a coherent theory). The Threshold Theory of categorization, for instance, posits that prior to making a categorization decision
the similarity between the item’s representation and the category’s representation is compared against an internal threshold (Hampton, 2007). If the assessed similarity exceeds the
threshold, the item will be endorsed as a category member;
otherwise it will not.
Most accounts of categorization will make the additional
assumption that consecutive categorization decisions are
made independently from one another. It is believed that every new item that is encountered for categorization will invoke the same similarity-assessment procedure that earlier
items have. That is, participants will provide a categorization
decision by determining whether the new item’s representation sufficiently resembles the category’s representation. The
answer that is provided on this particular categorization trial
is thus believed to be arrived at independently from the decisions that were made earlier (and the ones that await). In
the framework of the Threshold Theory, for instance, every
new categorization decision entails a comparison of the itemcategory similarity against the internal threshold, without regard of the decisions for alternate items.
This assumption of independence might prove too strong,
particularly in the context of the tasks that are employed to

Data

The next section provides additional information about the
Rasch model. In our exposition of the model we will use
indices c to refer to categorizers (nc in total) and indices i to
refer to items (ni in total).

Categorization
Two hundred and fifty first year psychology students at the
University of Leuven completed a categorization task for partial fulfillment of a course requirement. The task included
8 categories with 24 items each. The categories consisted
of two animal categories (fish and insects), two artifact categories (furniture and tools), two food categories (fruits and
vegetables), and two activity categories (sciences and sports).
The corresponding category items included clear members,
clear nonmembers, and borderline cases. The data collection
took place in a large classroom where all participants were
present at the same time. Each of them was handed an eightpage questionnaire to fill out. They were told to carefully read
through the 24 items on each page and to decide for each item
whether or not it belonged in the category printed on top of
the page. Participants indicated their answer by either circling 1 for yes or 0 for no. Five different orders of category
administration were combined with 2 different orders of item
administration, resulting in 10 different questionnaires. Each
of these was filled out by 25 participants.

Applying the Rasch Model to Categorization
In the Rasch model individual categorization decisions xci are
considered the outcomes of Bernoulli trials with probability
pci . Equation (1) expresses how pci is fully determined by the
values of θc and βi . It expresses that the more βi exceeds θc
on a latent scale, the higher the probability is that categorizer
c will endorse item i, and vice versa.
pci =

e(βi − θc )
1 + e(βi − θc )

(1)

This formalization is reminiscent of the Threshold Theory’s claim that categorization decisions arise from the assessment of the similarity between the item’s representation
and the category’s representation (Hampton, 2007). This assessment results in the positioning of the item along a latent
similarity scale (i.e., fixing the item’s βi value). The further
along the scale an item is positioned, the higher its similarity
to the category is assumed to be. According to the Threshold Theory categorizers then impose threshold criteria on the
scale to determine whether the assessed similarity affords a
positive rather than a negative categorization decision. The
value of θc is taken to indicate the position of a categorizer’s
threshold criterion. The probability expressed in Equation (1)
decreases with θ. Low values of θc indicate rather liberal categorizers for whom a modest degree of similarity suffices to
conclude category membership. High values of θc characterize more conservative categorizers who require extensive
similarity between item and category to conclude category
membership. Differences in the estimates of θc allow the
Rasch model to account for the variable extension of natural
language categories.
Indeed, Verheyen et al. (2010) applied the model to 250
participants’ categorization decisions towards potential exemplars of eight natural language categories to show that
it accords with the inter-individual differences in the data.
Moreover, they also found the model to reconcile the counterintuitive finding that the items afford both binary membership
decisions and continuous typicality ratings. The estimates of
the items’ positions along the latent scale correlated almost
perfectly with independently provided ratings of their typicality. This accords with the Threshold Theory’s assertion
that there exists a linear relationship between item-category
similarity and typicality.
In the following section we elaborate on the Verheyen et al.
(2010) categorization data that we will reanalyze to look for
LIDs. To evaluate whether these LIDs can be interpreted in
terms of item-item similarity, an external measure of similarity is required. We also discuss the procedure used to obtain
such a measure.

Similarity
Ninety-two first year psychology students at the University
of Leuven provided pairwise similarities for partial fulfillment of a course requirement. Eighty-three of them provided
ratings for the 276 item pairs of one of the eight categories
of fish, insects, furniture, tools, fruits, vegetables, sciences,
and sports. Six students provided ratings for the pairs of two
of these categories, two students provided ratings for three
categories’ pairs, and one student rated the item pairs of seven
categories. All the items that belonged to a particular set were
shown before the onset of the similarity rating task. This procedure served two purposes: We wanted to ensure that participants had an idea about the degree of similarity and difference that was represented in the set and we wanted them
to only rate the pairs from a set of which they knew all the
items. Because participants did not always know all the items
in a particular set, they sometimes had to complete a different set than was originally intended. Because of this not
all sets were completed by the same number of participants.
For fish, insects, furniture, tools, fruits, vegetables, sciences,
and sports pairwise similarities were provided by 16, 15, 14,
15, 15, 12, 10, and 11 participants, respectively. Each of them
rated the similarity of every item pair by providing a number
between 1 (totally dissimilar) and 20 (totally similar). Item
pairs were presented in a random order. The presentation order of items within a pair was also randomized. The ratings
were averaged across participants and reliabilities were estimated by split-half correlations corrected with the SpearmanBrown formula. The reliability estimates ranged between .86
for vegetables and .93 for sciences.

matrix, the higher the value for the corresponding empirical log odds ratio is. If the Rasch model is able to capture
the dependencies the categorization data present with, the
square matrix on the left should not differ greatly from the
four square matrices on the right. They represent the log odds
ratios obtained from four simulated data sets. Each of these
data sets was constructed using the parameter estimates that
resulted from fitting the Rasch model to the empirical categorization data. It would appear that the matrix holding the
empirical log odds ratios contains somewhat more structure
than the matrices holding the simulated log odds ratios do.
The results in Figure 2 would thus suggest that there are dependencies present in the categorization data that the Rasch
model doesn’t capture. The same conclusion follows inspection of similar figures for the remaining categories.
Although the graphical model evaluation procedure has
the benefit that it provides an overview of discrepancies pertaining to dependencies at a glance, the extent of the discrepancies remains subject to interpretation. One could of
course look deeper into the matrices to find out for which
item pairs the greatest differences emerge, but no principled
means of deciding which of these differences constitute substantial ones is readily available. The following method for
detecting LIDs provides a manner to remedy this.

}

Detecting Local Item Dependencies
The Rasch model assumes that categorization decisions are
made independently from one another. It not only shares this
assumption with many competing categorization models, but
also with the majority of other item response models. As a
consequence, many means of detecting violations of independence have been put forward in the item response models literature. In this section we will employ two of these to investigate whether such violations also characterize categorization
data. The subsequent section will be devoted to the substantive interpretation of these results. In order to detect LIDs we
first need to apply the Rasch model to the categorization data
that were described earlier. This
entails a replication of the
1
modeling exercise conducted by Verheyen et al. (2010).
We implemented the Rasch model in WinBUGS (Lunn,
Thomas, Best, & Spiegelhalter, 2000) using the code that is
provided in Figure 1. Note that a normal distribution is defined over the θc ’s. We opted to estimate the standard deviation of this distribution for every category, instead of including a separate scaling parameter α for every category as
was done in Verheyen et al. (2010). We employ the posterior means across 5 chains with 10,000 samples each as point
estimates for the various model parameters.

Correlations between Standardized Residuals
Given the parameter estimates of an applied model, evidence
of local dependence between two items can also be obtained
by calculating the correlation between the residuals of the observed and expected responses (Andrich & Kreiner, 2010).
This correlation provides a window into the association between items that is left unexplained by the model with its assumption of independence. Following the estimation of the
Rasch parameters we thus obtained the correlation between
the standardized residuals for each pair of items in a category. Wright (1977) provides the following formula for the
computation of individual standardized residuals:
xci − pci
with wci = pci × (1 − pci )
RESci = √
wci

Graphical Model Evaluation

In a regular search for LIDs the item pairs with the highest
correlations between their residuals are identified as violating
the independence assumption. It is common practice to set
a .05 significance criterion for this (e.g., Andrich & Kreiner,
2010). If we were to employ this heuristic 4 item pairs from
the fish category would be identified as locally dependent.
For the categories of insects, furniture, tools, fruits, vegetables, sciences, and sports, these numbers equal 5, 5, 2, 1,
4, 2, and 5, respectively. Together they constitute evidence
that violations of the independence assumption exist in the
categorization data. The results add to those of the graphical model evaluation procedure in that they are explicit about
the item pairs one should sit up and take notice of. Table 1
holds for every category an example of an item pair with significantly correlated residuals. The nature of these items suggests that item-item similarity might be responsible for their

One way of assessing whether the categorization data present
with LIDs is graphical in nature and incorporates the rational
behind parametric bootstrapping (Tuerlinckx & De Boeck,
2004). Figure 2 includes the results of applying this procedure to the categorization data of the sciences category. For
all possible item pairs in the category, the empirical log odds
ratio was computed:
log(

(n11 + .5)(n00 + .5)
)
(n10 + .5)(n01 + .5)

and converted in a gray-scale value. (In Equation (2) n11 is
defined as the observed frequency of a joint (1,1)-response
for the item pair under study, and so on.) These values were
subsequently placed in the upper triangular part of the left
most square matrix in Figure 2. The lighter a square in the

(N = 276). The correlation between the dependency estimates
and item-item similarity is by no means perfect. However,
one does need to take into consideration that these correlations with item-item similarity were obtained after typicality
was partialled out. Indeed, application of the Rasch model
to the categorization data in Verheyen et al. (2010) yielded βi
estimates that correlated between .94 and .98 with rated typicality. As a consequence it is safe to say that the information
conveyed by the residuals is typicality-free. Provided that
typicality is one of the major organizing principles of similarity ratings that have been obtained in the context of a semantic category (e.g., Verheyen, Ameel, & Storms, 2007) we
believe it to be substantial that reliable correlations with itemitem similarity remain after the variable is partialled out. It
suggests that in addition to item-category similarity (i.e., typicality) item-item similarities inform categorization decisions
in natural language categories. That is to say, a categorization
decision pertaining to one item isn’t necessarily independent
from a categorization decision pertaining to another item.

dependence. In categorizing items as furniture or not, participants might consistently provide the same response to dishwasher as to refrigerator because their similarity as electrical
appliances is recognized. The answers towards the items psychology and sociology with respect to sciences might be dependent because both are social sciences. Similar arguments
can be constructed for the other item pairs in Table 1.

Procrustes Analyses

Understanding Local Item Dependencies

It might be more appropriate to scale the dependency estimates and similarity ratings than to employ the raw data. The
scaled association in which a particular item features is informed by all the available information about that item (i.e.,
the various other associations in which the item features)
and therefore considered more reliable. For instance, when
multidimensional scaling (MDS) is employed to approximate
associations in a geometrical space, the coordinates of the
items are determined such that the distances between them
optimally reflect their association (the greater the association
between two items, the smaller their distance in the space).
Since the distances in the space have to fulfill the triangle inequality, the positioning of two items is co-determined by the
other associations in which the items feature. Using MDS
to spatially represent dependencies/similarities has the added
advantage that it entails the prevailing means of representation that many models of categorization subscribe to (e.g.,
exemplar models, Nosofsky, 1984; prototype models, Smith
& Minda, 1998; ...) and many researchers have used to predict category-related behaviors (e.g., processing of analogies,

Correlation Analyses
Identifying some item pairs as dependent (and implicitly all
others as independent) by means of significance tests has a
certain amount of arbitrariness to it. After all, the pattern
of correlations between residuals might carry more information than is revealed by merely separating the significant ones
from the insignificant ones. Alternatively, one can make use
of all the dependency estimates. These can then be related to
the ratings of item-item similarity we collected.
As a first approximation of the relationship between the dependency estimates and the item-item similarities their Pearson correlation was calculated. The correlation was established at .43 for fish, at .57 for insects, at .34 for furniture,
at .29 for tools, at .30 for fruits, at .35 for vegetables, at .54
for sciences, and at .26 for sports. All of these correlations
are significant at the .0001 level of significance (according to
one-tailed t-tests).
Of course, the significance of a correlation of .26 should
not be overstated in light of the large number of observations

1975, ...).
The estimated item dependencies and the rated item-item
similarities for the eight categories were therefore subjected
to nonmetric multidimensional scaling. Configurations were
obtained in dimensionality 2 to 61 .

uration of the item-item similarities (#5). The 25 procrustes
errors that were in this manner obtained for every category
were compared against the procrustes errors that were obtained through the comparison of randomly generated spatial
configurations with the same dimensionalities. Spatial configurations of items in a particular dimensionality were constructed by randomly sampling the coordinates of the items
on all dimensions from a uniform distribution between 0 and
1000. Twenty-four items were included; the same as the number of items in the empirical data. This procedure was repeated 10,000 times in each of the dimensionalities 2 to 6.
These randomly generated spatial configurations were then
subjected to the same procrustes analyses we employed to
compare the spatial representations for the item dependencies and the item-item similarities. If the configurations for
the latter two data sets carry alignable information, the resulting error from the procrustes analysis should be less than that
obtained from the randomly generated configurations.
In the 200 (8 categories × 5 × 5 dimensionalities) comparisons that were conducted, the empirically observed procrustes errors fell 192 times (96%) below the 5% value of
the distributions of procrustes errors generated from random
configurations. This constitutes strong evidence that the commonalities that the procrustes analyses picked up are not due
to coincidence. That is to say, the configurations that represent the item dependencies share structure with the configurations that represent the item-item similarities. Again,
one needs to take into consideration that this correspondence
emerges despite the fact that the dependency estimates are
typicality-free. For four of the categories Figure 3 locates
the empirically observed procrustes error in the distribution
of procrustes errors from comparing random configurations.
Each vertical line represents the procrustes error from comparing one dependency configuration with one similarity configuration. The dimensionalities of these configurations were
chosen according to the elbow criterion2 . Each histogram
represents the procrustes errors from 10,000 comparisons of
random configurations with the same dimensionalities as the
empirical ones. The 8 comparisons in which the cutoff was
not met, arose from 3 categories. The two-dimensional configuration for the item-item similarities of the tools category
was responsible for 5 of these 8. This result might point towards a poor representation of the similarities in only two
dimensions. (According to the elbow criterion the representation of these similarities requires three dimensions.)

randomly generated configurations (histograms).
Whether the MDS solutions for the dependency estimates
correspond to those for the item-item similarities can be evaluated through procrustes analyses (Borg & Groenen, 2005).
In a procrustes analysis two spatial representations resulting
from MDS are fitted as closely to each other as possible using
linear transformations. The analysis yields an error measure
that reflects the degree of mismatch that remains after these
transformations. For each category we employed procrustes
analyses to fit each spatial configuration of the dependency
estimates (#5, dimensionality 2 to 6) to each spatial config1

MDS yields an error measure called stress that expresses the
deviance of the estimated distances from the observed associations.
Empirically observed stress values can be compared against stress
values that were obtained for random data to establish whether there
is any structure present at all in the data that is being scaled. Structured data are expected to present with lower stress values than data
without any real structure. This is of particular importance to the dependency estimates for which we took up the task of demonstrating
that they contain information that has traditionally been overlooked.
We subjected 10, 000 sets of uniformly distributed random associations between 24 items to the same nonmetric MDS procedure the
dependency estimates were subjected to. The lowest stress value that
was obtained in 2 dimensions equaled .294. In dimensionalities 3 to
6 the lowest stress values equaled .204, .140, .109, and .088, respectively. The stress values obtained for the dependency estimates were
invariably lower than the lowest values obtained through scaling of
the random data. The dependency estimates can thus be discerned
from random data. If the independence assumption would be justified, the correlations among the residuals following the application
of the Rasch model should not present with structure. Clearly, the
above simulations support our earlier findings that they do. In addition, the simulations do not suffer from the multiple comparison
problem, which is an issue in the significance testing of the correlations between residuals.

Discussion
In the preceding sections we have put the assumption that categorization decisions for different items are made independently from one another to the test. The Rasch model, with
its assumption of independence, was applied to categorization
2
When the stress values are plotted as a function of dimensionality, the resulting curve may exhibit a noticeable elbow. From that dimensionality onward the decrease in stress is thought to reflect error
fitting. The elbow is therefore believed to indicate the “appropriate”
dimensionality. See Verheyen et al. (2007) for details.

data for eight natural language categories. The subsequent
investigation of the residuals learned that departures from the
independence assumption indeed occur. Accordingly, these
dependencies should be explicitly acknowledged in the various frameworks that are being used to explain categorization
behavior. The Rasch model is part of the class of item response models. Tuerlinckx and De Boeck (2004) have proposed a range of item response models that allow LIDs to be
taken into account. We will focus here on a restricted version of what they term a nonrecursive model for LIDs. In this
model dependencies between items are handled by expressing the probability that a positive response is given to item i
conditionally on the responses to all other items:
logit(pci ∣ xc ) = βi − θc + ∑ xc j δi j

where the vector xc contains all responses of participant c
except the one to item i. We assume parameter δi j to equal
δ ji .
Based upon the results reported earlier, we expect that
item-item similarity would provide the most promising interpretation of the δ parameters in Equation (4). If this model
were to be found appropriate for categorization data and if
its parameters were indeed to correlate with similarity judgments, the model would be the first one that we know of that
allows similarities to be computed from categorization data
instead of the other way around. We believe this would constitute quite an achievement as the structural information carried by similarities is usually required by categorization models to properly predict categorization decisions. Indeed, most
categorization models - like the Generalized Context Model
(GCM, Nosofsky, 1984) for instance - require at their input
the similarities of the items that are to be categorized. In the
GCM this input takes the shape of a multidimensional space
of which the dimensions are elongated or shrunken appropriately to allow correct categorization. Several well-motivated
processes drive these transformations of the input space, but
it is clear that in natural language categories much of the categorization burden is achieved through the use of the already
highly structured similarity space. We do not wish to detract
from the merits of the GCM and other similar categorization
models, but at the very least it is a bit odd that these similarities are regarded as mere input, external to the model,
and are therefore not taken into account when the complexity of the model is determined. Contrary to this, we hope to
construct a model of categorization that is explicit about the
parametric complexity it entails and does not require similarity as its input. To the contrary, if the model would prove able
to predict item-item similarities, this would accommodate the
long standing concern that traditional models of categorization are unjustified in using similarity as an explanatory construct (Goodman, 1972; Murphy & Medin, 1985) and would
support authors like Quine (1977) who have suggested that it
could be the knowledge that two items are or are not in the
same category that drives judgments about their similarity.
