Abstract: This research investigated how the presence, basic features, and match of interface input capabilities to
a task domain can either stimulate or impede thinking about science. Studentsâ€™ hypothesis generation in biology
was compared while they used: (1) non-digital paper and pencil tools, (2) a digital paper and pen interface, (3) pen
