Memory for musical sequences beyond pitch: Grammatical and
associative processes
Richard Ashley
Northwestern University
Abstract: Memory for music can be detailed and concrete even without conscious effort to encode. We hypothesize
that this is because of a symbiotic relationship between memory and musical structure. The stimuli in our experiments
are drum patterns derived from a published corpus. The grammars of these patterns are asymmetric in their transition
probabilities, sparse as matrix structures, and referential, in that one sound (instrument) is centrally connected to
other sonic elements. Participants heard drum sequences taken from the corpus, or manipulated for the three
significant features. They then identify examples as previously heard or as lures. Results to date confirm that
memory is enhanced for sequences with grammars that are asymmetrical, referential, and sparse; manipulation of
any of these factors degrades memory for these sequences. We propose that these three factors are primary cognitive
elements of perception beyond the domain of musical pitch, and consider parallels with linguistic sound structure.
