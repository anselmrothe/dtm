Semantic innovations in lexicon: cognitive pragmatic interface
Vera Zabotkina
Russian State University for the Humanities
Abstract: The paper focuses on the interrelation of language use with linguistic structure and underlying conceptual
structure. We proceed from the assumption that new meaning development involves both cognitive and pragmatic
issues. We explore the cognitive basis of semantic innovations and the way the individual sense alterations that arise
from deviations in the words use are developing into a new meaning of a lexeme. We concentrate on the analysis of
the conceptual structure of a word as the major factor imposing constraints on deviation and meaning variation in a
wide pragmatic context. The conceptual structure of a polysemantic word is represented as a macroframe consisting
of several frames which form a radial structure. We develop the hypothesis about the pragmatics as the chief driving
force in the processes of new meaning development and define the cognitive basis of two types of inference: pragmatic
and semantic ones.
