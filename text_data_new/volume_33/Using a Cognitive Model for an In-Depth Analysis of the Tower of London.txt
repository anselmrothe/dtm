Abstract
(A)

(A)

The Tower of London (ToL) is a transformation task extensively used and well-established as a neuropsychological diagnostic tool for assessing human planning ability in clinical
and research contexts. Behavioral experiments have recently
shown that planning in the ToL is substantially influenced
by structural task parameters. This work presents an ACT-R
model of the ToL that explains structural influences by using
different strategies, whereby, strategy selection depends on visually observable characteristics. Model evaluation was based
on a problem selection that accounted for systematic variations
of task demands. Based on comparisons with empirically observed planning latencies from previously published data, we
argue that task-specific structural characteristics are necessary
to explain human planning strategies.

Introduction
The Tower of London (ToL) task (see Fig. 1a) is a planning
task originally proposed by Shallice as a neuropsychological tool to measure planning deficits in patients with frontal
lobe damages (Shallice, 1982). Today it is widely used as a
general assessment tool to evaluate executive and planning
functions. In addition, the ToL has also been used in numerous studies within the domain of cognitive psychology
(cf. Gilhooly, Phillips, Wynn, Logie, & Sala, 1999; Hodgson,
Bajwa, Owen, & Kennard, 2000; Newman & Pittman, 2007;
Phillips, Wynn, McPherson, & Gilhooly, 2001; Kaller, Unterrainer, Rahm, & Halsband, 2004; Kaller, Rahm, Bolkenius, &
Unterrainer, 2009; Ward & Allport, 1997).
Typically participants receive a ToL problem (see Fig. 1a)
as a start state (A) and a goal state (B). The task is to find a
shortest sequence of moves transforming the start state into
the goal state. A move consists of a colored bead, a start
peg and a target peg. The constraints for executing a move
are: (1) only one bead may be moved at a time and (2) only
the top bead on any peg may be moved. ToL problems differ
with respect to the number of moves, the number of beads and
structural characteristics of problems to be solved (cf. Kaller,
Rahm, Spreer, Weiller, & Unterrainer, 2011). The ToL task
is in some respects similar to the Tower of Hanoi (ToH) task
(see Fig. 1b) as it shares a similar environmental structure,
the same constraints concerning the moves, and the kind of
problem to be solved (cf. Kaller, Rahm, Köstering, & Unterrainer, 2011). The beads in the ToH task, however, are distinct
by their size. Therefore, the task has the additional constraint
that only smaller beads may be placed on larger beads.

The present work aims at elucidating the influence of structural task properties on planning behavior. Analyses are focused on the ToL that - compared to the ToH - was applied in
the vast majority of related publications in MEDLINE-listed
journals (cf. Kaller, Rahm, Köstering, & Unterrainer, 2011).
We provide an ACT-R model which uses a general heuristic
capable of solving the ToL tasks assessed in the experimental
study. This model uses different strategies which are selected
based on the structural distribution of beads in the environment.

State of the Art
The Cognitive Architecture ACT-R. ACT-R is a modular
cognitive architecture with an underlying production system
operating on symbolic representations of declarative memory
items – so-called chunks (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998; Anderson et al., 2004). The system consists of specific modules
corresponding to certain aspects of human cognition. Hence,
the system provides a module for processing visually presented information (vision module), a module for directing
goal driven behavior (goal module), a module for inferring
new information (imaginal module), and a module to store
long-term memory items (declarative module). Each module
has a dedicated interface (buffer) which can store one chunk
at a time.
The functionality of the system is driven by production
rules which represent the procedural memory component. A

Problem Representation. As described above, a cognitive
model in ACT-R is divided into declarative and procedural
knowledge. In the reported experiment all declarative information is presented visually to the participants. Consequently, the cognitive model receives the information visually
and must operate on an internal representation. Therefore, a
special representation is used which enables the agent to interpret a visual object as a certain part of a ToL board including relations to other objects (e.g. a certain bead is located
on a certain peg). Fig. 3 shows the information the model is
able to infer from the environment. A chunk representing a
peg captures additional information concerning the colors of
the beads placed on it. Additionally, a bead holds information
concerning the peg number and the slot number it is placed
on.

Figure 3: Environmental information encoded by the model.

Heuristic. Besides declarative information, procedural
knowledge is used to model all activity necessary to solve a
ToL problem. As our goal is to provide a generalized heuristic for solving tower tasks which is, however, capable of explaining planning behavior specific for the ToL, we integrated
a heuristic developed by Anderson et al. (2005). To solve the
ToH their model constructs a subgoal for the largest bead not
on its target location (see Fig. 1b, bead 3). Given the constraint that only smaller beads may be placed on larger beads
this subgoal has to be solved first. The largest bead (bead 3),
however, is blocked by another bead (bead 2). Consequently,
a subgoal for moving the other bead (bead 2) out of the way
is constructed. This process goes on until a subgoal is finally
executable. Eventually, the bead corresponding to the executable subgoal is moved and the last subgoal which was not
executable is retrieved from long-term memory. For our ToL
model we use a similar heuristic, which is shown in Fig. 5. In
a first step, a bead of a certain color is selected (select-bead).
For the selected bead, start and target location are determined
and a subgoal is constructed based on the collected information (find-counterpart). Afterwards, the start and the target
position are compared (infer-distance). If the corresponding
bead is not already on the correct location, the constraints
are checked in order to test if the subgoal can be solved directly (check-constraints). At this point, three different inferences are possible. First, if the subgoal is executable, the
current working state is updated and the heuristic starts again
for another subgoal (update-internal-representation, retrieveIR). Second, if the subgoal cannot be executed given the constraints the heuristic starts over by constructing/retrieving a
subgoal for the blocking disk. Third, it is possible that in a
task no bead can be moved to its target location directly. In
this case, a cycle between two subgoals is detected and an
intermediate step for a bead is processed (select-peg-for-IS).

Inferring Knowledge. Besides visual information provided by the environment additional declarative information
is necessary to solve a given instance of the ToL. Therefore,
we use subgoals which capture information of the start and
the target position of a certain bead, whereby the bead is
named by its color. For processing and linking subgoal information we included findings from Altmann and Trafton
(2002) by treating these chunks as ordinary memory objects.
Nevertheless, their solution had to be adjusted to capture the
specific requirements of the ToL. First, the ordering of subgoals is not provided by cues in the environment for the reason that the beads itself are not ordered by size. Humans,
however, are able to remember the last inspected bead. As
a consequence, a subgoal holds additional information concerning the color of an old subgoal which could not be executed before. Nevertheless, as only the color is saved the old
subgoal has to be retrieved from declarative memory. Additionally, as no ordering is provided by the environment we
assume that the retrieval of old subgoals can fail. Therefore,
we do not use a rehearsal mechanisms to artificially prevent
subgoals from decay.
Furthermore, there is also a major difference in the experimental setting mostly used for the ToL compared to the experimental settings used to asses the ToH. Whereas in the ToH
the environment may be changed if a subgoal is executable,
in the ToL it must not. As a consequence, a mental representation is needed which can capture the current state during the
solution process. Therefore, we use one chunk representing
the current state in order to keep track of changes in the overall solving process. The representation of a current state is
necessary for the reason that start and target position have to
be updated to enable a correct solution process.

Example. Fig. 4 shows an example of how the ToL heuristic works on the given knowledge representation by solving
the ToL instance shown in Fig. 3. The visual locations visited by the model are referenced in Fig. 3 using numbers in
the upper left corner of a bead. The goal buffer stores information concerning a current subgoal. The imaginal buffer
holds a chunk with one slot for each possible bead location
in the initial state as this representation is changed during the
planning process. The retrieval buffer contains a chunk which
could be retrieved from long-term memory.

The heuristic works as follows: First bead C is selected
(step-1) and a corresponding subgoal is constructed including
information concerning the target location (step-2). The start
location of bead C is determined and the subgoal is updated
accordingly. As bead C is already on the correct location no
further processing for the current subgoal is necessary (step3). The heuristic starts over by selecting bead B (step-4). As
for bead C a subgoal for bead B is constructed and checked
(step-5, step-6). The check shows that bead B is not on the
correct location. Therefore, it is determined if bead B can be
moved given the constraints. The check results in a violation
of a constraint, as bead B is blocked by bead A (step-7). A
new subgoal for bead A is constructed (step-7), completed
(step-8) and checked (step-9). The subgoal corresponding to
bead B is committed to memory. Additionally, the color of
bead B is saved to indicate the subgoal which structurally led
to the new subgoal (step-7). In order to be able to infer structural dependencies between the positions of bead A and bead
B, the model also tries to retrieve the subgoal for bead B (step8). If the retrieval of the subgoal corresponding to bead A was
successful, the model is able to infer that an intermediate step
is necessary (step-10). Otherwise, the necessary information
have to be collected again by visual search. For the processing of an intermediate step an intermediate position has to be
selected. In this context, the intermediate position may not
interfere with start and target locations of the involved subgoals. In this case, the model chooses peg 3 as an intermediate position for bead A (step-11). To complete this mental
operation with capturing the costs the working state in the
imaginal buffer is updated, committed to long-term memory
(step-12), retrieved from long-term memory (step-13) and reconstructed in the imaginal buffer (step-14). Additionally, the
subgoal corresponding to bead B is retrieved in order to check
if it is executable now. At this point, all cycles are resolved.
In the next two runs through the heuristic the moves for bead
B and bead A can be planned and the problem is solved.

Strategies. Besides the general heuristic we assessed more
sophisticated strategies with regard to structural task characteristics tested in the experimental study. These strategies allow for an improved heuristic if the correct inference can be
drawn based on additional declarative information accessible
in a step. These additional strategies, however, only extend
the heuristic. The probability of selections depends on an associated utility value. All improved heuristics are shown in
Fig. 5 as dotted lines. The labels of dotted lines comply with
strategies represented in Table 1.
The first criteria assessed in this context is the goal hierarchy (U). We assume that certain constraints do not have to
be checked if all beads are located on one peg in the goal
state. The reason is, that the target peg for all disks remains
the same and only the correct ordering has to be determined.
After the first bead can be moved to the bottom position of
the target peg it is not necessary to check for the second bead
if the mid position of the target peg is reachable.

goal move for a bead which was moved out of the way is also
possible without an additional run through the heuristic.

Figure 5: Overview of the Heuristic: Shows the heuristic used
by the model to solve 3-move Tower of London problems.
Black arrows relate to a specific decision based on current
information. These arrows are labeled with the information
used in a specific step. Dotted arrows show uncertain decisions based on task structure (for the labels, cf. Table 1). For
the utilities please refer to Fig. 6.

Evaluation. To evaluate the cognitive model we assessed
the performance of the general heuristic in combination with
the additional strategies. For this reason, we varied the utility
values of the additional strategies systematically. Adjusting
utility values controls the probability for choosing specific
strategies in contrast to executing the general heuristic. To
exclude other structural influences we systematically varied
the different start and goal states. The tested task structure,
however, was preserved. Additionally, we used three possible starting strategies: backward planning (planning beads ordered from bottom to top on a peg in the goal state), forward
planning (planning beads ordered from top to bottom on a
peg in the start state) and a mixed strategy with forward planning for partially ambiguous problems and backward planning for unambiguous problems. The results of the evaluation
are shown in Fig. 6, whereby the best fit is provided by the
combination of probabilities shown in Fig. 6d.

For the second criteria concerning the search depth we provide additional mechanisms to infer that an intermediate step
is necessary. In this context we assessed two task structures
used in the experimental study. In the first structure a bead
is already on the correct peg but not in the correct slot (C1).
Therefore, it is necessary to move this bead out of the way
first. This inference can be drawn based on a comparison of
the start and a target position of a certain bead. In the second
structure a tower consisting of two beads has to be moved
to another peg without violating the order between the beads
(C2). Fig. 3 shows an example for this structure. That an
intermediate step is necessary to solve this structure can be
inferred by comparing start and target locations of the corresponding subgoals. In both situations the necessary information are given before the constraints are checked for both
subgoals. As a consequence, this step can be skipped if the
inference is drawn by the model.
Additionally, we assessed the overall overview participants
gained when the necessity of an intermediate step is inferred.
This includes the question of how many subgoals can be
solved in the phase where an intermediate step is processed.
When an intermediate step is processed, the current goal is to
enable a move for one bead to its target location. In this context, the goal of moving another bead out of the way is only
a subgoal of the current goal. Therefore, we assume that the
enabled goal move can be executed right after the other bead
was moved out of the way. Additionally, it is possible that the

Discussion
We developed a Tower of London ACT-R model able to replicate behavioral data reported in Kaller, Rahm, Spreer, et al.
(2011). These problems consisted of four problem classes
posing different degrees of difficulty. In a first step, we
adapted and adjusted some heuristics from Tower of Hanoi
(cf. Anderson & Douglass, 2001). In a next step, we evaluated these heuristics and extended them to account for task
specific structural characteristics. The results indicate that the
recognition of structural characteristics is an important factor for explaining human planning behavior in the context of
the ToL. For problems without an intermediate step (U, I) the
general heuristic is capable of explaining latencies in planning. Here, the correct order of moves has to be determined
to solve the task and, therefore, all steps of the heuristic have
to be processed. For problems with an intermediate step (U-I,
P-I), however, certain steps of the heuristic may be skipped.

The reason is, that structural information can be observed visually in the environment which trigger the inference that an
intermediate step is necessary. Additionally, participants may
gain enough overview of the overall task structure to solve
the task directly after the intermediate step was inferred. A
similar mechanisms was found for problems with an unambiguous goal hierarchy (U, U-I). In these cases it is not necessary for participants to check all constraints if the correct
inference can be drawn based on the information provided by
the environment. Taken together, the present systematic analyses allowed for an identification of specific strategies presumably applied by human planner. For future refinements,
concurrent evaluation of eye-tracking data may provide more
insights about the planning process (cf. Kaller et al., 2009).
