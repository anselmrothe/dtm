Abstract

Wippich, 2003), and age-related implicit learning
differences have been found between seven-year-old
children and adults (Barry, 2007).
In most cases, where developmental differences in
implicit learning is found, adults out-perform children. It
perhaps is not surprising to see a developmental
progression in statistical learning, with more basic
abilities acquired first, followed by more involved
processing components (Saffran, 2003). On the other
hand, an alternative is that young children might actually
possess better or more efficient learning mechanisms than
adults. Some proposals take the somewhat paradoxical
stance that cognitive limitations and/or reduced input may
confer a computational advantage for learning (Conway,
Ellefson, & Christiansen, 2003; Elman, 1993; Newport,
1990), which may explain the presence of sensitive
periods in language development.
To explore these issues, the current study aims to
investigate the neural mechanisms of visual statistical
learning in both adults and children using the event
related potential (ERP) technique. Some previous studies
have used ERPs to investigate implicit learning in adults,
with particular components associated with the
acquisition of rule-based or statistical sequential patterns.
One type of response, the N2, is observed as a negativegoing deflection in voltage potential, appearing
approximately 200 ms after the presentation of a stimulus.
Another, the P300, is a positive deflection that appears
about 300 ms after stimulus onset (Eimer, Goschke,
Schlaghecken, & Stuermer, 1996; Ferdinand, Mecklinger,
& Kray, 2008). These ERP components often appear
together in learning studies (Schlaghecken, Stuermer, &
Eimer, 2000), and it has been suggested that both
components reflect stimulus-evaluation processes
(Rüsseler & Roesler, 2000). Ferdinand et al. (2008) argue
that the N2 indexes the detection of deviant stimuli, while
the P300 reflects the evaluation of incoming information
and the updating of contextual representations. It may
also be possible to interpret these two components in
terms of the degree to which automatic vs. controlled
processing are involved, with the earlier N2 reflecting
more automatic or implicit learning mechanisms.
For the present study, we developed a novel learning
paradigm – based on the classic oddball task – that is
conducive to the measurement of ERPs in both adults and
children. The task involved viewing a stream of visual
stimuli that contained covert statistical patterns governing
the probability of a target stimulus occurring. ERPs were

Implicit statistical learning refers to the acquisition of
statistical patterns occurring under incidental learning
conditions. Although statistical learning is central to the
development of many cognitive domains, such as language,
its developmental trajectory is largely unspecified.
Furthermore, few studies have attempted to examine the
underlying neural mechanisms supporting statistical
learning, in adults or in children. In this study, we used a
novel visual statistical learning paradigm that allowed us to
investigate the neurophysiological correlates of learning in
adults, older children (aged 9-12), and younger children
(aged 6-9). The results depict a nuanced picture of the
development of statistical learning, involving the use of
two distinct neurocognitive processing mechanisms
associated with the N2 and P300 components. In addition,
the results suggest that the children’s brains acquired the
statistical structure quicker than the adults, with learningrelated ERP components emerging after comparably less
exposure to the patterns.

Introduction
Implicit learning refers to the automatic, unconscious, and
effortless acquisition of information that generally results
in knowledge that is difficult to express verbally
(Cleeremans, Destrebecqz, & Boyer, 1998; Eimer,
Goschke, Schlaghecken, & Sturmer, 1996). One type of
implicit learning is statistical learning, which refers to the
acquisition of statistical patterns in the environment
(Perruchet & Pacton, 2006). Implicit and statistical
learning are believed to be important contributors to
aspects of cognitive development, such as language
acquisition (Conway, Bauernschmidt, Huang, & Pisoni,
2009). However, few still have probed the neural
mechanisms mediating statistical learning in adults let
alone children, making it difficult to specify the
neurocognitive development of these learning processes.
Although Reber (1993) suggested that implicit learning
is developmentally invariant, other researchers have
provided evidence of developmental differences in
implicit learning. In an fMRI study, Thomas, Hunt
Vizueta, Sommer, Durston, Yang, and Worden (2004)
found behavioral and functional neuroimaging differences
in implicit learning between children 7 to 11 years of age
and adults (also, see McNealy, Mazziota, & Dapretto,
2010). Furthermore, a pattern of development in implicit
learning abilities has been detected between six-year-old
and ten-year old children (Mecklenbräuker, Hupbach, &

compared across three groups of participants (adults,
older children, and younger children) for three different
types of stimuli that reflected differing transitional
probabilities (high-probability, low probability, and zero
probability). Finally, we investigated ERP responses early
in the task (first two blocks) versus later in the task (last
two blocks, out of five blocks total) to ascertain how
much exposure to the stimulus patterns is required before
ERP evidence of learning occurs.

Impedances were kept below 50 kilo-ohms, and the data
was digitized by NetStation acquisition software
(Electrical Geodesics, Inc.).

Method
Participants
Thirteen adults between 18 and 23 years of age (mean:
20.69; 9 female) participated. Also, two groups of
children were recruited: older children (n = 9, mean:
10.55; range 9-12 years; 4 female), and younger children
(n = 9, mean age = 7.44; range 6-9; 5 female). Adult
participants were recruited from the undergraduate
population of Saint Louis University or lived in the
surrounding area. Child participants were recruited from
the St. Louis metropolitan area. All participants were free
from cognitive, neurological, and psychological deficits.

Figure 1: Sequence of colored circles for each of the three
stimulus types (high-, low-, and zero-probability predictor
conditions).

Following data acquisition, the continuous raw EEG
recording was filtered through a 0.1 Hz high pass filter
and a 30 Hz low pass filter. ERP recordings were timelocked to the onset of each predictor circle – not the target
– using a 100 ms baseline, and continued for 900 ms after
onset (for a total segment length of 1000 ms). This
resulted in 50 individual trials for each of the three
predictor conditions (high-, low-, and zero-probability).
An artifact detection operation removed trials containing
activity associated with eye blinks and other movements.
Data from channels with poor signals were replaced with
data extrapolated from surrounding channels in a bad
channel replacement operation.
Based on previous ERP research, we expected that the
N2 and/or P300 components would be present if
participants had learned the statistical association between
the high-probability predictor and the target. As these two
components appear in the centro-parietal region of the
scalp, this is where we focused, using a montage of 6
sensors corresponding to the 10-20 Pz electrode.

Experimental Paradigm
The visual statistical learning task involved participants
viewing a serial stream of colored circles appearing in the
center of the computer screen, one at a time. Participants
were told to press a keypad whenever a target color (e.g.,
green) appeared on the screen. What participants were not
explicitly told was that the target color was predictable to
varying degrees depending on the color immediately
preceding it. Each trial began with the presentation of one
to five filler circles. After the filler circles, one of the
three predictor circles would appear, determined
randomly. Each predictor circle had its own unique color
(determined randomly for each participant). When the
high predictor color appeared, the target and filler circle
followed 90% and 10% of the time, respectively. When
the low predictor color appeared, it was followed by the
target and filler circle 20% and 80%, respectively. When
the zero predictor color appeared, it was never followed
by the target, and was always followed by a filler. The
possible trial sequences are illustrated in Figure 1.
Each circle was presented on the screen for 500 ms on a
black background, followed by a black screen for 500 ms.
For each of the three conditions of predictive probability,
there were 50 trials (for a total of 150 trials), which were
divided into five blocks of 30 trials each. Within each
block, the trials were presented randomly.

Results
Participants were told to press a button whenever the
target color stimulus was presented on screen, which was
predicted at different levels of probability by a predictor
color. Thus, if learning has occurred, behavioral responses
to the target should be facilitated when it is preceded by
the high predictor color.
Although the primary goal of this study was to
investigate the ERP correlates of learning, we also
analyzed behavioral indices of learning by measuring
reaction times (RTs) to the targets. A series of 2x2
repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for each of
the three participant groups separately, with the factors of
block (first two blocks vs. last two blocks) and predictor
(high vs. low predictor conditions). Note that because the
target never is preceded by the zero predictor color, the

zero predictor condition cannot be included. For the adult
participants, RTs to the target decreased from the
beginning to the end of the experiment, but only when it
was preceded by the high predictor color (F(2, 38) = 3.70,
p<.05). That is, by the end of the experiment, adult
participants had learned that the high predictor was a
reliable predictor of the target’s appearance, as
demonstrated by faster RTs to the target. However,
neither group of children showed changes in RT for the
high or low predictors, suggesting that they did not learn
the statistical contingencies. On the other hand, another
possible interpretation is that the children actually learned
the statistical contingencies early in the experiment, and
thus there was no change in RTs because of that.
A more complete picture should emerge by looking
directly at the neurophysiological data, which may be a
more sensitive measure of learning.

In order to verify the visual inspection, two 3x2 repeated
measures ANOVAs were conducted using the mean
amplitude waveforms as the dependent variable, and the
factors of blocks (first two blocks vs. last two blocks) and
predictor type (high, low and zero predictor conditions)
for each of two latency periods of interest. The first
period sought to examine potential differences related to
the N2 component in the time window of 180 to 240 ms.
The second time window was selected to examine the
P300 component, using the window of 300 to 600 ms.
The ANOVA and pairwise comparisons reported here and
throughout the remainder of the paper were calculated
using mean voltage deflections recorded at six electrodes
centered on the location of the Pz sensor in a standard 1020 montage. Reported p values are those reflecting the
Greenhouse-Geisser correction for nonsphericity of
variance.
In the time window 180 to 240ms post-stimulus, the 3x2
ANOVA found significant main effects for both predictor
(F(2, 293) = 10.69, p < .001) and block (F(1, 35) = 5.96,
p = .015), as well as for the interaction of predictor x
block (F(2, 412) = 22.76, p < .001). For the present
purposes, what is of most interest is whether an N200
manifested itself by the end of the experiment in the last
two blocks, when learning would be expected to have
occurred. Notably, pairwise comparisons indicated that
there were no significant differences between the three
predictors in the last two blocks (high versus low, t(209)
= -1.05, p = .30; high versus zero, t(209) = -1.67, p = .10;
and low versus zero, t(209) = 0.03, p = .98). This set of
analyses highlights the lack of an N2 component in the
adult participants for the last two blocks.
In the time window 300 to 600ms post-stimulus, a 3x2
ANOVA found significant main effects for both predictor
(F(2, 1864) = 323.80, p < .001) and block (F(1, 974) =
563.70, p < .001), as well as for the interaction of
predictor x block (F(2, 1768) = 340.61, p < .001).
Importantly, pairwise comparisons indicated significant
differences between the high versus low predictor
conditions in the last two blocks (t(974) = 24.53, p <
.001) and the high versus zero predictor conditions also in
the last two blocks (t(974) = 29.42, p < .001). However,
there was not a significant difference between the low
versus zero predictor conditions in the last two blocks
(t(974) = 1.17, p = .24). This set of analyses highlights the
P300 component which presents itself in the adult data
during the last two blocks.
In sum, the adult ERP data suggests that statistical
learning – learning that the high predictor color was a
reliable predictor of the target – was reflected by a P300like component associated with the high predictor
condition in the last two blocks. On the other hand, an N2
component was not observed.

ERP Effects for Adults
Figure 2 shows the grand averaged ERP waveforms for
the adult participants for each of the three predictor
conditions. Visual inspection suggests that in the last two
blocks, there is no N2 component. On the other hand,
there is a very prominent late positivity – similar in
appearance to a P300 component – that is associated with
the high predictor condition specifically.

ERP Effects for Older Children

2528

Figure 3 shows the grand averaged ERP waveforms for
the older children participants for each of the three
predictor conditions. Visual inspection suggests some
similarities as well as differences as compared to the
adults. Specifically, the last two blocks look very similar
to the adults in that there is not a prominent N2
component but there is a P300-like late positivity
associated with the high predictor condition. On the other
hand, in contrast to the adult data, there is evidence of a
P300 occurring even early in the experiment in the first
two blocks.

In the time window 300 to 600ms post-stimulus, the
3x2 ANOVA found a significant main effect for predictor
(F(2, 1161) = 185.71, p < .001), as well as for the
interaction of predictor x block (F(2, 1339) = 8.47, p <
.001). The main effect of block was not significant
(F(1,674) = 1.66, p = .20). Relevant significant
differences were found in the last two blocks between the
high versus the low predictor conditions (t(674) = 9.92, p
< .001) and the high versus the zero predictor conditions
(t(674) = 11.07, p < .001). In addition, the pairwise
comparison for the high predictor condition in the first
two blocks versus the high predictor condition in the last
two blocks was not significant (t(674) = -0.35, p = .72).
These analyses demonstrate not only the appearance of
the P300 component in this group by the end of the
experiment, but also that this component appeared to be
present even early on in the experiment, in the first two
blocks.
Thus, despite the behavioral data suggesting that
learning did not occur, the ERP data presents compelling
neurophysiological evidence that just like the adults, a
P300-like component was elicited by the end of the
experiment for the high predictor condition, suggesting
that learning did indeed occur. Strikingly, this group of
older children also showed evidence of the P300
component occurring earlier in the experiment than did
the adults.

ERP Effects for Younger Children
Figure 4 shows the grand averaged ERP waveforms for
the younger children participants for each of the three
predictor conditions. Visual inspection suggests some
similarities as well as differences as compared to the
adults and older children. Similar to both the adults and
older children, there is a P300-like component in the last
two blocks associated with the high predictor condition;
this P300 component does not appear robust in the first
two blocks. In contrast to the other two groups, there is
also a prominent N2 component that occurs both in the
beginning and ending blocks of the experiment.
To verify the visual inspection, two 3x2 repeated
measures ANOVAs were conducted for each of the two
latency periods as was done with the other two participant
groups. In the time window 180 to 240ms post-stimulus,
the ANOVA found significant main effects for both
predictor (F(2, 221) = 24.27, p < .001) and block (F(1,
134) = 24.34, p < .001), as well as for the interaction of
predictor x block (F(2, 213) = 14.91, p < .001). There
were significant differences in the last two blocks
between the high versus the low predictor (t(134) = -5.87,
p < .001) and the high versus the zero predictor (t(134) = 5.61, p < .001) suggesting the occurrence of an N2. In the
first two blocks, the high predictor also was significantly
different than both the low (t(134) = -2.83, p = .005)) and
zero predictors (t(134) = -6.98, p < .001)). This set of
analyses demonstrates the presence of an N2 component

Figure 3: ERP waveforms in the Pz region for the older child
group.

Two 3x2 repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted
for each of the two latency periods as done with the
adults. In the time window 180 to 240ms post-stimulus,
the ANOVA found significant main effects for both
predictor (F(2, 214) = 3.56, p = .04) and block (F(1, 134)
= 16.84, p < .001), as well as for the interaction of
predictor x block (F(2, 252) = 18.85, p < .001). Despite
the main effect of predictor and the interaction, the
expected N2 effect did not obtain in the last two blocks.
Neither pairwise comparison involving the high versus
low predictor were significant, in the first two blocks
(t(134) = -0.22, p = .83) or the last two blocks (t(134) =
0.01, p = .99). This set of analyses highlights the lack of
an N2 component in this group of participants.

the last two blocks.

neurophysiological findings create a more nuanced
picture. For the adult group, a statistically significant
positivity was seen in the Pz region in response to the
presentation of the high-probability predictor, in the time
window 300 to 600 ms post onset, similar to a P300. This
ERP was observed during the last two blocks of trials
presented, but not during the first two blocks, suggesting
that, during the course of the experiment, the participants
implicitly learned the statistical patterns that governed the
occurrence of the target. Importantly, this P300 effect for
the high predictor stimuli was elicited even though the
three predictor types were perfectly equated in terms of
their overall frequency of occurrence. The P300 is an
index of target detection and evaluation (Van Zuijen et
al., 2006), and also has been elicited in other types of
implicit sequence learning and statistical learning tasks
(Baldwin & Kutas, 1997; Carrión & Bly, 2007; Rüsseler
et al., 2003).
The group of older children (ages nine to 12) also
displayed a learning-related P300 component but
appeared to differ from the adult group in the rate at
which it emerged. While the adults did not display any
evidence of a P300 in the first two blocks of trials, the
older children showed it even at this early stage in the
experiment. This result suggests that children at this age
are able to learn visual statistical sequential patterns given
less exposure to stimuli (i.e., fewer trials) than adults.
The ERP responses of the group of younger children
(ages six to nine) to the high-probability predictor showed
both similarities and differences compared to those of the
adults and the older children. Like both the adults and
older children, the younger children displayed a learningrelated P300 in the last two blocks. Unlike the older
children, the younger children did not show evidence (in
the form of a P300) that they had acquired this knowledge
during the first two blocks of trials. On the other hand,
there appears to be an N2 response to the high-probability
predictor even in the first two blocks of trials. The
amplitude of this early negativity is greater in the last two
blocks, and clearly distinguishes the response to the highprobability predictor from the responses to the zeroprobability and low-probability predictors.
This pattern of ERP responses suggests a complex
developmental progression in visual statistical learning
abilities. Children between the ages of roughly six to nine
appear to rely on a distinct cognitive learning mechanism
associated with the N2 component. Because the N2 is a
relatively early component, its elicitation may signify a
more automatic and implicit learning mechanism, which
builds up knowledge efficiently and quickly. In turn, the
P300, a relatively late latency component, emerges only
following additional exposure to the statistical patterns,
and may signify more consciously-mediated or controlled
processing mechanisms. After sufficient exposure to the
stimulus patterns, these younger children display both the
N2 and P300 responses to the high-probability predictor,

Figure 4: ERP waveforms in the Pz region for the younger child
group.

In the time window 300 to 600ms post-stimulus, the
3x2 ANOVA found a significant main effect for the
predictor (F(2, 1113) = 71.03, p < .001) and block (F(1,
674) = 26.96, p < .001), as well as for the interaction of
predictor x block (F(2, 1246) = 88.17, p < .001). The high
predictor was significantly different than both the low and
zero predictors in the last two blocks, but was not
different from the low predictor in the first two blocks
(t(674) = -1.38, p = .17), suggesting that the P300-like
component did not emerge until the end of the
experiment.
In sum, like the adults, a P300-like component was
found that did not fully emerge until the last two blocks of
the experiment. On the other hand, unlike the adults and
older children, the younger children also displayed an N2
response for the high predictor stimuli that was present
even very early in the experiment.

implying that both learning mechanisms contribute to
young children’s statistical learning.
Older children between the ages of about nine to 12
appear to rely more heavily on the more controlled
processing mechanism reflected by the P300 than by the
automatic learning mechanism reflected by the N2. For
this group of older children, a P300 response first appears
during the first two blocks of trials. This stands in contrast
to the response of the younger children, who displayed an
N2 response, but not a P300, in the early trials, and to the
response of the adults, who did not show any evidence of
learning during the first two blocks of trials. In other
words, both groups of children differ from adults in that
knowledge resulting from statistical learning appears to
develop more quickly in both groups of children, though
mediated by different learning mechanisms.
One similarity between the adults and the older children
can be found in the latency of the P300 ERP response. For
these groups, the waveform for the high-probability
condition diverges from the waveforms for the lowprobability and zero-probability conditions between
approximately 300 and 600 ms following the onset of the
predictor circle. For the group of younger children, the
latency of the late positivity in the high-probability
condition is shifted roughly 100 ms later, beginning at
about 400 ms and ending around 700 ms. This, together
with the earlier appearance of the P300 in the group of
older children, suggests that the learning mechanism
associated with the P300 response is not fully developed
in children until the age of nine.

Conclusion
This study investigated the development of the
neurocognitive mechanisms underlying visual statistical
learning. Whereas adults and older children relied
exclusively on a learning mechanism associated with the
P300 component, younger children relied primarily on an
N2-related component, perhaps reflecting that their
learning is more automatic and intuitive in nature. Even
more striking is that both groups of children displayed
neurophysiological evidence for learning earlier – i.e.,
after fewer trials – than the adults. This last effect may
indicate that the child’s brain is ‘primed’ to learn, despite
showing poor behavioral learning effects, and even may
be related to sensitive periods in language acquisition.
Future research must further explore the distinction
between the two types of learning mechanisms observed
here, and how the development of these abilities relate to
language and other cognitive learning domains.
