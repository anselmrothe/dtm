Abstract: In everyday interactions, people have to deal with the sight of a face and sound of a voice at the same
time. How the perceptual system brings this information together remains unclear. In 2 studies, we investigated
how facial and vocal cues are integrated during social categorization by recording participants’ hand movements (via
the x, y coordinates of the computer mouse) en route to ”male” and ”female” responses on the screen. Participants
were presented with male and female faces that were accompanied by a same-sex voice morphed to be either sextypical or sex-atypical. Before settling into ultimate sex categorizations of the face, the simultaneous processing of a
sex-atypical voice led the hand to be continuously attracted to the opposite sex-category response. This is evidence
that ongoing results from voice perception continuously influence face perception across processing. Thus, social
categorization involves dynamic updates of gradual integration of the face and voice.
