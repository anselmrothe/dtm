measures of feature association from measures predicting
people’s preferences for particular category structures.
In the second, we describe an experiment comparing the
three measures. In the third, we present the results of
this experiment. Finally, we discuss what these results
mean for other areas of cognitive psychology such as categorization and similarity judgment.

Abstract
In this paper, we develop three measures of association
between concepts and features from three measures of
category structure preference. These measures are total cue validity, feature possession score, and category
utility. We compare these measures experimentally using stimuli from the Leuven Natural Concept Database
(de Deyne et al., 2008). We find the measure developed
from feature possession score, collocation, best captures
human associations between concepts and features, followed by the measure developed from category utility,
and finally the measure developed from total cue validity. We discuss how these results can be applied to open
questions in categorization and similarity judgment such
as domain differences in representation and modeling
the effects of context.
Keywords: Mental representation; categorization; similarity judgment

Association Measures
Each of the category structure preference measures used
here were originally developed to explain basic level preference. Within a category hierarchy, the basic level is
the preferred level of abstraction for describing objects.
Key findings are objects are categorized into basic-level
categories more quickly than sub- or super-ordinate categories, basic level objects are named faster, objects are
described preferentially with basic level names, more features are listed at the basic level than at the superordinate level, basic level names are learned before names
at other levels, and basic level names tend to be shorter
(Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976).
How basic people consider a category to be is a measure of their preference for its category structure. Since
people prefer basic level categories to non-basic level categories for a large number of mental operations related
to categorization, it seems reasonable to think of these
categories as the standard for what people prefer categories to look like. Consequently, as how basic a category
is considered to be decreases, so does people’s preference
for its category structure.
We derive measures of association between a feature
and a concept for each of three measures of category
structure preference: total cue validity (Rosch et al.,
1976), feature possession score (Jones, 1983), and category utility (Corter & Gluck, 1992). To do this, we
apply a principle we term the feature impact hypothesis.
It states that the features people associate with a concept should be the features that have the largest impact
on category structure preference for the category consisting of the concept’s instances. Categories are abstracted
from objects at least in part to help infer whether a novel
object has one or more unobserved features given one or
more features that have already been observed. Thus, it

Suppose someone asks you which of the features has
wings and sings you associate more with the concept
birds. What about the relationship between the two features and birds determines your answer? One possibility
is that it is determined by how many birds have each
feature. Almost all birds have wings but only a few can
sing, so you would associate has wings with birds more
than sings. Another possibility is that it is determined
by how specific the feature is to birds. A number of
animals besides birds have wings, for instance bats and
wasps, but no other animals sing, so you would associate
sings with birds more than has wings.
Associations between concepts and features form the
basis of many theories of mental representation. For example, feature-based theories of mental representation
hold that a concept is represented in terms of some number of (normally discrete) features. The associations
people form between concepts and features determine
which features will be used to represent a particular concept. Alternatively, dimensional theories of representation hold that a concept is represented by its values on
some number of continuous dimensions. People’s associations determine which dimensions will be used to represent a concept and what the values on each dimension
will be.
The purpose of this paper is to compare empirically
three different measures of feature association using their
predictions of which feature you would choose. We procede as follows. In the first section, we develop the three

stands to reason that those features that caused a person to prefer a particular category structure in the first
place should be the same features that the person now
associates with the category.
The remainder of this section develops three measures
of the association between a feature and a category. For
each of these measures – cue validity, collocation, and
change in category utility – we start by defining the
measure of category structure on which the measure is
based. Respectively, these are total cue validity, feature
possession score, and category utility. We then apply
the principle that people associate high impact features
with categories in order to derive the three measures of
association.

stimulus given that the stimulus is a member of category
c. Intuitively, collocation can be thought of as the degree
of bi-implication between fk and c. Collocation is high
for features that are possessed by most members of c but
few non-members. From these individual collocations,
feature possession score is computed by associating each
feature to the category it has the largest collocation with
and summing the collocations of all features associated
with c.
Applying the feature impact hypothesis to feature possession score leads to each feature’s collocation being its
degree of association with the category. As with total
cue validity, we would like to find those features that
offer the largest individual contributions to feature possession score. Since collocation is only large when most
exemplars of a category have a feature but most exemplars of different categories do not, collocation can only
be large for a single category. Then, when a feature’s
collocation is large for a particular category, the feature
will have a large impact on preference for that category’s
structure.

Cue Validity
Cue validity is the conditional probability that a stimulus belongs to category c given that it possesses feature
fk . Intuitively, it can be thought of as the degree to
which having feature fk implies being a member of category c. Cue validity is high when most of the stimuli
that possess feature fk are members of c and is low when
most of the stimuli are not members of c.
Rosch et al. (1976) suggest using cue validity to determine which categories belong to the basic level. They
argue that some of the features used to represent a stimulus will be linked with category c and propose using the
sum of the cue validities of the linked features to determine which category is the basic level category. Unfortunately, Rosch and colleagues do not offer a method for
determining which features are linked with which categories.
Applying the feature impact hypothesis to total cue
validity leads to each feature’s cue validity being its degree of association with the category. We would like to
find those features that offer the largest individual contributions to the total cue validity. The contribution
of an individual feature that is linked with the category
simply its cue validity. Though the original theory developed by Rosch et al. (1976) does not specify criteria for
selecting which features to link with a category, it seems
reasonable to assume that a feature is more likely to be
linked with a category when its cue validity with the
category is high. Then, features with high cue validity
have the most impact on category structure preference,
since those features are most likely to be linked with a
category and have the most impact when linked.

Category Utility
Category utility (Corter & Gluck, 1992) derives from
the assumption that the purpose of a category is to convey information about the features of its exemplars. It
is defined as the overall increase in the probability of
correctly guessing, using probability matching, whether
an object has each member of a set independent features upon learning that the object belongs to category
c, normalized by the probability of observing c. Probability matching means that people guess whether an
object has a feature with probability equal to the probability that the object has the feature. For example, if
p(fk ) is the probability an object has feature fk , then
p(fk ) is the probability a person will guess the object
has feature fk and [p(fk )]2 is the probability they will
correctly guess the object has feature fk . Then, for a set
of M independent features, the category utility is
p(c)

being its degree of association with the category. As
with the previous two structure preference measures, we
would like to find those features that offer the largest
individual contributions to category utility. Equation (2)
shows that those features that offer the greatest increase
in being correctly induced will have the most impact on
category utility.

Jones (1983) defines feature possession score in terms of
another quantity called collocation. The collocation of
feature fk is
p(c|fk ) × p(fk |c),

where p(c|fk ) is the product of the cue validity of fk , and
p(fk |c) is the conditional probability of observing fk in a

Methods

uli to compute the association between each feature and
category using each of the three measures.
To illustrate this process, we will compute the association between the concept birds and the feature has
wings. Recall that the cue validity of feature fk is the
probability a stimulus belongs to category c given the
stimulus has fk . In our case, this means that the cue
validity of the feature has wings for the concept birds is

We describe in this section an experiment to determine
which of the three association measures best captures human associations between concepts and features. Overall, the experiment consists of presenting a number of
triads containing a concept and two features and asking participants to select which of the two features they
more strongly associate with the concept.
Each triad was constructed to differentiate two measures of association. We selected feature pairs such that
one measure, measure A, finds the first feature strongly
associated with the concept but not the second feature,
and the other measure, measure B, finds the second feature strongly associated with the concept but not the
first. Then, a participant selecting the first feature supports measure A being the better model of human associations, and a participant selecting the second feature
supports measure B the better model.
Recall our introductory example with the concept
birds and the features has wings and sings. The probability that an animal has wings greatly increases upon
learning that it is a bird, but the probability that an
animal sings only modestly increases. Because of this,
category utility judges the association between birds and
has wings to be high, and the association between birds
and sings to be low. Alternatively, bats and a number
of insects have wings, but no animals other than birds
sing. Cue validity then judges the association between
birds and has wings to be low, and the association between birds and sings to be high. Thus, selecting has
wings as being more associated with birds supports category utility being a better model of human associations
than cue validity, and selecting sings supports cue validity being a better model than cue validity.
Our description of the experiment consists of three
parts. First, we describe the process used for creating
our stimuli. We then describe the participants in our
experiment. Finally, we describe the experimental procedure.

# birds with wings
.
# animals with wings
The Leuven data set contains 43 stimuli that have wings,
of which 30 are birds, so this cue validity is 30/43 = 0.69.
Now recall that Equation (1) gives the collocation of
feature fk as p(c|fk )×p(fk |c) for category c. In our case,
this is the cue validity of has wings times the proportion
of birds exemplars with has wings,
# birds with wings
# birds with wings

.
# animals with wings
# birds
The Leuven data set contain 30 birds exemplars in total,
so the collocation of has wings is 30/43 × 30/30 = 0.69
for birds.
Finally, Equation (3) gives a feature fk ’s contribution
to category utility as [p(fk |c)]2 − [p(fk )]2 . In our case,
p(fk ) is the proportion of animals which have the feature
has wings, so feature fk ’s contribution to category utility
is
 # birds with wings 2  # animals with wings 2
−
.
# birds
# animals
The Leuven data set contains 129 animals exemplars,
43 of which have the feature has wings. Then, the contribution of has wings to category utility is [30/30]2 −
[43/129]2 = 0.88.
Once we had computed the association between each
five animals concepts and 765 animals features and each
of the six artifacts concepts and 1295 artifacts features,
we needed to select triads of one concept and two features
to present to participants. We had two primary goals in
mind when doing this. First, we wanted to select triads whose features have the largest possible difference
in predicted association between the two measures being compared. Second, we wanted to represent as many
different concepts and features as possible. Whenever
possible we used each concept in at least one comparison for each set of measures. This resulted in 61 triads
of one concept and two features.

Stimuli
The stimuli used in our experiment consist of triads consisting of a concept and two features. To choose the
triads we start with the feature representations of 129
animals in terms of 765 features and 166 artifacts in
terms of 1295 features contained in the Leuven Natural
Concept Database (de Deyne et al., 2008), a database of
normative data for a large number of animal and artifact concepts. The 129 animals are distributed among 5
animals categories, mammals, birds, fish, insects and reptiles, and the 166 artifacts are distributed among 6 artifact categories, clothing, kitchen utensils, musical instruments, tools, vehicles and weapons. These 11 categories
are the concepts in our experiment. Since we know which
category each stimulus belongs to, we can use these stim-

Participants
Our participants consisted of thirteen students and faculty from the University of California, Irvine. Of these
thirteen, one was faculty, two were undergraduates, and
ten were graduate students. Their ages ranged from 20
to 42. No compensation of any kind was offered.

Table 1: Percentages of comparisons in which participants chose the feature whose highest association was from by
the first model. The first two columns give the measures being compared. The last three columns give the percentage
of comparisons in which Measure A was chosen for animals, artifacts, and all comparisons, respectively.

Procedure

two columns of the table show the measures being compared. The last three columns show the percentage
of comparisons in which participants chose the feature
whose highest association was assigned by the measure
in the ‘Measure 1’ column. The ‘Animals’, ‘Artifacts’,
and ‘All’ columns show these percentages for animals,
artifacts, and all (animals and artifacts together) comparisons. A percentage above 50 indicates that Measure
1 accounted for people’s associations better than Measure 2. A percentage below 50 means the reverse. For
example, the ‘94’ in the ‘Animals’ column of the first row
means that the feature with high collocation and low cue
validity was chosen over the feature with high collocation and low cue validity in 94% of comparisons. This
indicates that collocation accounted for people’s choices
better than cue validity.
The percentages in Table 1 give an overall ordering
on how comparatively well the three measures fit human
judgments of association. It shows that collocation best
describes human judgments, followed by category utility,
and finally cue validity. This ordering is consistent across
domains.

Stimuli for this experiment were presented to participants in MATLAB. The format for each was identical to
the following.
Which of these features best describes
BIRDS:
(1) HAS WINGS
(2) SINGS
Response (Enter 1 or 2):
In these stimuli, the concept always comes in the same
position as birds in the example. The features always
followed on separate lines with the number 1 preceding
the first feature and the number 2 preceding the second. Participants were always reminded to enter 1 if
they preferred the first feature and two if they preferred
the second.
In performing the experiment, each participant first
viewed a set of instructions explaining how to complete
this experiment. Participants indicated they had read
the instructions, at which point, the experiment started.
The 61 triads were shown in two segments. In the first
segment, all of 32 animals triads were shown. In the
second, all the 29 artifacts triads were shown. The presentation order of the triads was randomized across participants, as was the which of the two features was presented first. Finally, the display was cleared after each
response, so that only one stimulus was ever displayed
at a time.

Individual
Figure 1 shows how often each of the three association
measures was chosen by each of our participants in comparisons. In the plots, solid lines correspond to choices
in comparisons between features of animals concepts and
dashed lines correspond to preferences in comparisons
between features of artifacts concepts. As in Table 1, the
dependent measure is the percentage of comparisons in
which the first of the two measure in each title was chosen. For example, Participant 4 always chose the feature
with high collocation in comparisons between cue validity and collocation . Both the solid and dashed lines are
zero for Participant 4 in the first plot, indicating that
in comparisons between cue validity and collocation, cue
validity was chosen in 0% of comparisons.
The plots in Figure 1 allow us to draw a number of
conclusions about the presence of differences across individuals and domains. The first plot shows each participant’s choices in comparisons involving cue validity
and collocation. Here we find that participants consis-

cations. First, we relate our finding of potential domain
differences in which association measure best captures
human associations between concepts and features to
the previous findings of domain differences in the way
concepts are represented (e.g. Keil, 1989; Zeigenfuse &
Lee, 2010). Second, we suggest how our results could be
used to understand how context affects categorization
and similarity judgments. Finally, we relate our work to
work by Murphy (1982) arguing against cue validity as
a measure of category basicness.

tently chose the feature with high collocation regardless
of whether the concept was an animal or artifact.
The second plot shows participant’s choices in comparisons involving cue validity and category utility. In
this plot, Participants 1 – 10 consistently chose the feature with high category utility regardless of whether the
concept was an animal or artifact. Participants 11 – 13,
however, chose the feature with high category utility for
most animal comparisons, but the feature with high cue
validity for most artifacts comparisons. This suggests
that there may be individual or domain differences in
which of these measures best captures people’s choices.
Finally, the third plot shows participant’s choices between features favored by collocation and category utility. Here, Participants 2, 11, 12 and 13 consistently chose
the feature with high collocation regardless of whether
the concept was an animal or artifact, and Participant
10 consistently chose the feature with high category utility. Participants 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 chose features with high
collocation and category utility in equal proportions for
animals comparisons, but most often chose features with
high collocation in artifacts comparisons. Participants 3,
4, and 8 chose features with high category utility most
often in animals comparisons, but features with high collocation most often in artifacts comparisons. The large
variety in participant’s choices strongly suggest individual or domain differences in which of collocation and
category utility best captures people’s choices.

Domain Differences
Numerous authors have found that the types of features
used to represent concepts depends upon the domain to
which those concepts belong. Zeigenfuse and Lee (2010),
for example, looked at the ability of sets of features selected according to collocation to fit human similarity
judgments. They found that features selected in this
way fit similarity judgments between animals considerable better than between artifacts. This suggests that
people may use different criteria determine a feature’s
importance depending on the domain of the stimulus.
Here we also find that different domains of exemplars
may be represented in fundamental different ways. The
marked difference between how often people chose features with high collocation over features with high category utility in comparions among features of animals
concepts versus artifacts concepts suggests that they rate
importance more like collocation for artifacts than animals. Since the Zeigenfuse and Lee (2010) heuristics select feature sets according to their each feature’s importance, this suggests that they may be selecting features

cognition. In this section, we discuss three such impli-

are basic, then cue validity should best predict their feature importance rankings for basic categories. Our set of
concepts includes basic categories. Thus, people’s preference for features ranked highly by other measures provides evidence against aggregated cue validity being used
to determine category basicness.

Context
Context has been argued by many authors to play a large
role in categorization and similarity judgment (Medin,
Goldstone, & Gentner, 1993, for example). It is believed
that context modulates which features people pay attention to when categorizing concepts or judging the similarity between them. Unfortunately, none of the currently available theories of context effects are able to
predict which features will be important in a particular
context.
The current work has the potential to offer these types
of predictions. It seems likely that the features people
strongly associate with a concept should be the same features they use in categorization and similarity judgments
involving those concepts. Thus, by applying a measure
such as collocation, we could determine each feature’s
importance in these judgments.
Previous work by Zeigenfuse and Lee (2010) supports
this idea. As discussed in the previous section on domain differences, here the authors use feature subsets
selected using heuristics based two of the measures from
this paper, cue validity and collocation, to fit similarity
judgments between the animals and artifacts stimuli in
the Leuven data set. Echoing our result, they found features selected using collocation best able fit the observed
similarities. In some cases, the fit achieved using collocation to be nearly as good as their benchmark measure.
This suggests that a good measure of association, taken
in conjunction with a method for translating between associations and importances within specific models, will
be able to model the effects of context on categorization
and similarity judgments.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have empirically compared three
measures of association between concepts and features.
These measures were cue validity, collocation, and category utility. We found that collocation captured human
associations better than cue validity and category utility,
and that category utility captured human associations
better than cue validity. Additionally, we found strong
evidence for individual or domain differences (or both)
in which measure best captures people’s associations.
Though these results begin to paint a picture of how
people form associations between concepts and features,
additional work is needed. Future work should investigate the absolute ability of each measure to capture
human associations. Additionally, future work should
explore the relationship between the strength of a feature’s association with a concept and its role in categorization decisions and similarity judgments involving
that concept. This will allow us to develop not only
good measures of association, but to understand how
these measures affect context.

Basic-Level Categories
Our results suggest that people do not make judgments
of feature importance according to a cue validity. This
empirically supports Murphy’s (1982) theoretical argument that aggregating the cue validities of all of the features associated with a category is not a good measure
of how basic a category is. The argument is that given
nested categories, aggregated cue validity will always be
higher for the more inclusive categories. For example,
the category animals contains the category bird, and so
has the higher cue validity, but empirically, bird has been
found to be a basic level category but animals has been
found not to be (Rosch et al., 1976).
Our results support his argument as follows. Suppose
a category is determined to be basic on the basis of large
cue validities for associated features. If we then turn
around and ask people to produce cue validities for features associated with the basic category, the cue validities of these features should be high. As a consequence,
if people use cue validity to determine which categories
