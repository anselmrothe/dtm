Dreaming Cogniton and Acculturation Processes
Sang Bok Lee
Kangnam University
Abstract: The author suggests that dreaming cognition be modeled as reflecting dynamic, integrative, culturallysensitive, and historically holistic methods. The author conceptualizes six models of dreaming cognition. 1) Freudian
dreaming model, 2) Jungian analytic model, 3) neurocognitive or neurophysiological dreaming model, 4) acculturative
dreaming brain model (Sang Bok Lee, 2005: ”Lee Acculturation Dream Scale,” Psychological Reports, 96), 5)
Cognitive-experiential model, and 6) narrative meaning-making model. Neurocognitive dreaming model (”dreaming
brain” model) has been a turning point to rehabilitate Freudian and Jungian models in terms of recent neuroscientific
experimentation and verification utilizing clinical patients. Acculturative dreaming brain model complements crosscultural scheme of dream interpretation by using Korean-American college students’ dreams. Cognitive-experiential
model (”focusing” method) and narrative meaning-making model (story-telling and thematic analysis, ”Lee Crosscultural Dream Anxiety Scale” – Sang Bok Lee) provide some critical hermeneutics for dream interpretation.
