Abstract
The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is designed to measure
implicit attitudes, and is often claimed to reveal prejudicial
attitudes that are at odds with explicit attitudes. Numerous
proposals as to the information processing mechanisms underlying human performance on the IAT have been suggested,
many or all of which may well play a role. This makes it difficult to study them and their interactions experimentally in an
efficient manner. We describe a localist connectionist model
that simulates human performance on the IAT and that allows
us to explore many of the proposed explanations, by comparing the results with observations from actual experiments with
human subjects. By simulating the performance of virtual
subjects, the model also makes it possible to conduct “theoretical” experiments that could not be undertaken with real
subjects in the real world.

Introduction
The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee &
Schwartz, 1998) is a computer-administered test (see e.g.,
https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/) designed to measure
automatic associations between concepts, where such associations are assumed to underlie implicit attitudes towards
attitude objects (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995). It has been
used in a variety of domains, including age, race, selfesteem, sexual orientation, and so on. By being implicit,
these attitudes are assumed to be beyond conscious control
(Greenwald & Banaji, 1995) and thus cannot be assessed
with explicit measures such as self-reports. Instead, the IAT
seeks to measure implicit attitudes by recording subjects’
response times as they complete a number of tasks, the
performance on which is assumed to involve accessing
automatic associations. Such tasks involve pressing a Left or
Right key on a keyboard to classify sequentially presented
stimuli into one of two categories. Each category comprises
one of two target concepts (e.g., flower or insect) crossed
with one of two evaluative attributes (e.g., pleasant or unpleasant). This results in four possible pairings, two of
which are, by hypothesis, incompatible (e.g. insect and
pleasant) and two of which are compatible.
A central assumption of the IAT is that the stronger the
associations between an attitude object and its evaluative
attributes, the stronger the implicit attitude. Thus, a person
with a negative attitude towards insects is assumed to have a
correspondingly strong association between the concept
insect and some general concept for negativity. The idea is
that the strength of these associations will be reflected in
people’s response times on the classification tasks, with
longer latencies for incompatible pairings than for compati-

ble pairings. This difference in response times between trials
for incompatible and compatible pairings is known as the
IAT effect (Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz, 1998).
Although the IAT is widely used (Greenwald, Poehlman,
Uhlmann & Banaji, 2009), its history is rife with controversy. Questions have been raised as to whether measuring
automatic associations is a valid way of measuring implicit
attitudes (Blanton & Jaccard, 2006), and whether it is indeed
measuring automatic associations at all (De Houwer, 2001;
Brendl, Markman & Messner, 2001). Researchers have also
wondered whether IAT effects might be partially due to
other factors such as differences in stimulus familiarity
(Dasgupta et al, 2000; Ottaway, Hayden & Oakes, 2001) or
salience asymmetries between target concepts (Rothermund
& Wentura, 2004), and whether they might merely be a
reflection of prevailing cultural norms rather than of genuine attitudes (Karpinski & Hilton, 2001).
Given these various proposals, several accounts of the
processing mechanisms underlying the IAT have been advanced. These include the figure-ground asymmetry model
(Rothermund & Wentura, 2001), a random-walk model
(Brendl, Markman & Messner, 2000), a diffusion model
(Klauer, Voss, Schmitz & Teige-Mocigemba, 2007), an
acquired meaning of response keys account (De Houwer,
2001) and a suggestion that longer response latencies are the
result of task-set switching overheads (Mierke & Klauer,
2001; Klauer & Mierke, 2005) occasioned by moving between compatible and incompatible task blocks. Finally, a
quad model of implicit task performance (Conrey, Sherman,
Gawronski, Hugenberg & Groom, 2005) postulates that
multiple processes are at work – some automatic and others
more controlled (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977; Shiffrin &
Schneider, 1977).
These differing explanations are not necessarily mutually
exclusive. It might be that some, or even all of them, play a
role, in which case one would need a model that could,
among other things, account for (i) the interaction between
automatic and control processes (e.g., Mierke & Klauer,
2001; Herd, Banich & O'Reilly, 2006), (ii) cue and response
competition induced by the interference of competing stimuli in incompatible trials (e.g., Praamstra & Seiss, 2005),
(iii) resolution of these conflicts (e.g., through the mutual
inhibition of competing action tendencies, Atkinson &
Birch, 1970), and (iv) increase in cognitive processing (e.g.,
Snyder-Tapp & Dale, 2009) and reduction in speed and
accuracy (Klauer & Mierke, 2005) on incompatible trials.
To investigate some of these issues, we developed a computational model intended to emulate human performance
on the IAT. The model handles the generation of output
behavior, and allows us to investigate such issues as re-

sponse competition and conflict resolution (see (ii) and (iii)
above). The work we present here focuses on the application
of the model to the Race-IAT because it is the most controversial and is the version of the test for which there exists
the most empirical data (e.g., Greenwald et al., 1998; Karpinski & Hilton, 2001) – this latter fact giving us more opportunity to compare human and model performance.

If as is widely believed, the IAT effect is indeed the result
of patterns of activation of underlying associations between
target concepts and evaluative attributes, then the kind of
network model we are discussing is ideal for simulating the
behavior of human subjects in the IAT; it simply involves
configuring the network so that it represents the relevant
associative biases in virtual subjects.

Model Overview

Modeling Virtual Subjects In addition to the Associative
Network, each simulated subject has two other main components: a Task Mapper, and a Response Generator (see Figure 1). The Task Mapper dynamically transmits activation
levels of concepts from the Associative Network to the
press-left or press-right nodes, which serve as cues for the
corresponding actions or motor responses. The Response
Generator, when necessary, resolves competition between
these cues to generate one of the two motor responses (i.e.,
key presses). When simulating the performance of a group
of subjects, each virtual subject is configured with the same
network topology, but with randomly distributed connection
weights so as to produce a varied sample of simulated subjects. This is achieved by perturbing connection weights
with normally distributed noise of mean µj,i = 0 and standard
deviation σj,I = 0.1, which is large for wj,i∈[–1, 1]. The result
is that, with a default wj,i of ±0.5, the majority (95%) of
connections across subject populations ends up with magnitudes in the [0.3, 0.7] range. Introducing random perturbations to connection weights further ensures that the outcome
of the task is not critically dependent on any particular distribution of connection weights.

The model employs a spreading activation algorithm operating on a localist connectionist network (see, e.g., Page,
2000). It emulates the multiple pathways leading from the
initial perception of a visual stimulus (in our case, a word or
image) to the automatic activation of concepts in memory
through to the motor response called for by the particular
task instructions. As in all localist connectionist models, the
nodes in the network are semantically meaningful entities
representing concepts or processes, with connections between them representing associative strengths. The actual
behavior of such networks depends critically on the details
of their topology and the algorithms used. Mathematically
speaking, the network can be defined as a graph G={V, E}
with nodes V and connections or edges, E. Each node vi
contains a label namei representing a particular concept or
process, and a quantity xi representing its activation level:
(1)
vi=<namei , xi>; vi∈V ; xi∈[–1, 1].
Connections or edges take the form:
(2)
εi,j=<vi , vj , wi,j>; εi,j∈E ; vi , vj∈V ; wi,j∈[–1, 1] ,
where wi,j is the associative strength between nodes vi and vj.
The propagation rule for successive iterations is:
(3)
xi (k + 1) = (1 − δ ) xi (k ) + α
x j (k ) ⋅ w j,i (k ) ,
ε j,i∈E
where α is the gain (set to 0.2) and δ is a decay parameter
(set to 0.001) that reduces activation over time. In this way,
activation spreads to vi from each neighbor vj at a rate proportional to wj,i in each time step. Parameter values in these
ranges ensure that activation levels do not saturate prematurely and have sufficient momentum to accumulate. Prior
to the introduction of a perturbation factor (see below), the
connections weights are initialized with magnitudes of 0.5.

Mapping Stimuli to Concepts for the Race-IAT The main
concepts for the Race-IAT are the target concepts AFRICANAMERICAN (AA) and EUROPEAN-AMERICAN (EA), along with
the generic evaluative attributes POS-itive and NEG-ative.
Whereas there are many variants of the Race-IAT, in the
version we are modeling, the verbal (input) stimuli for the
Race-IAT are words belonging to the semantic fields pleasant (e.g., happy, wonderful, joy) or unpleasant (e.g., evil,
horrible, hurt). The pictorial stimuli are faces of (all presumed to be unfamiliar) European-American or African-

American individuals. As each input is presented to a virtual
subject, a signal indicating the occurrence of a specific
verbal or pictorial stimulus is transmitted to the subject’s
network. For instance, if the word wonderful is presented,
the concept WONDERFUL is activated, which in turn increases the activation level of the concept POS. If a picture
of a random European-American face is presented, it activates a concept for an individual European-American face,
which in turn activates the concept EUROPEAN-AMERICAN. In
both cases, the path lengths from input nodes to EA or AA,
and to POS or NEG are the same.
Task Switching and Mapping Concepts to Cues for Motor Responses The Task Mapper serves as a network
switchboard that, depending on the task, transmits the
accumulated activation from target concepts and their
evaluative attributes to the concepts corresponding to Left
and Right key-press responses. These latter concepts need to
be distinguished from the actual key-press responses themselves, for which reason we refer to them as response cues.
For instance, if the current task were a Right key press for
pleasant words or pictures of European-Americans, the Task
Mapper would establish connections from both POS and
EUROPEAN-AMERICAN to cueR (see bottom half of the ICT
panel in Figure 2). The assigned connections remain enforced for each block of trials, but are reconfigured for each
subsequent task. To some extent, this reconfiguration process is an approximation of task-set switching (Klauer &
Mierke, 2005) and emulates the dynamic remapping of
valence to keys across different task blocks (De Houwer,

Response Competition and Mutual Inhibition The Response Generator is a network-based implementation of the
Cue-Tendency-Action (CTA) model (Revelle, 1986), which
is a re-parameterization of Atkinson and Birch’s (1970)
Dynamics of Action theory. CTA models the dynamic interaction between conflicting tendencies and conflicting actions. The reduction in action-tendencies that results from
the successful completion of the corresponding action is a
form of negative feedback referred to in Figure 1 as consummation. In the present context this captures the fact that
pressing a key satisfies the need to produce a response.
Finally, mutual or cross inhibition between two competing
actions (i.e., pressing Left vs. Right) ensures that only one of
the two actions will be performed.
Performing the Task The result of the interaction of the
processes and representations described above is a competition between all propagation pathways from stimulus input
nodes to the final key-press output nodes. For instance,
suppose the task is to press a Left key for pictures of European-American faces or pleasant words and a Right key for
pictures of African-American faces or unpleasant words.
When a European-American face is presented to the model,
the concept of EUROPEAN-AMERICAN is eventually activated,
and relatively more activation is transmitted to cueL in the
Response Generator. However, if the simulated subject is
initially configured with a stronger connection between
EUROPEAN-AMERICAN and NEG, activation is also transmitted to cueR, leading to competition with cueL. This results in
competition between the Left and Right responses, reducing
the degree to which activation accumulates in the Left response node, and as a consequence more time is required for
it to reach the threshold for the actual response.

Simulation Results
A schematic diagram of the simulation system is shown in
Figure 3. Twenty-five simulated subjects (each having its
own unique associative network) were assigned to each of
four groups differing in their associative configurations as
follows: (a) excitatory associations between AFRICANAMERICA and NEG, EUROPEAN-AMERICAN and POS, and inhibitory, otherwise; (b) excitatory associations between
EUROPEAN-AMERICAN and NEG, AFRICAN-AMERICAN and
POS, and inhibitory, otherwise; (c) equal associations
(modulo random perturbations described above) between
both target concepts and evaluative attributes; and (d) no
associations (i.e., connection weights with a mean of zero)
between target concepts and evaluative attributes. Each
virtual subject was put through all five standard IAT tasks
(see Figure 2), namely, the initial target concept discrimination (ITCD), associated attribute discrimination (AAD), initial
combined task (ICT), reversed target concept discrimination
(RTCD), and reversed combined task (RCT). On each trial, the
subject was presented with a simulated verbal or pictorial

stimulus and the number of iterations (typically between 20
and 50) taken to produce a response was recorded. This was
then transformed into a simulated response time (in milliseconds) by a scaling factor calibrated to the specifications
of the computer on which the simulation was run. In this
way, mean response times across subjects and conditions
were scaled to the same order of magnitude as those reported in experiments with human subjects. The IAT effect
is then taken to be the difference between mean response
times in the ICT and RCT blocks. As in actual IATs, only
correct responses are analyzed.
Plots of response times in Figure 4 for all task blocks and
magnitudes of the IAT effect in each group indicate, as
expected, the presence of IAT effects in the experimental
groups (a, b). The effect in (a) is a preferential evaluation of
European-American stimuli (ta(24)=22.3, pa<.001), while
African-American stimuli are preferentially evaluated in (b)
(tb(24)=-18.0, pb<.001). No significant effects are found in
the control groups (c, d) (tc(24)=-0.923, pc=0.365; td(24)=
-1.22, pd=0.235). Results of planned comparisons of IAT
effects between the experimental (a, b) and control (c, d)
conditions are shown in Table 1.
Just as in actual experiments with human subjects (e.g.,
Greenwald et al., 1998; Klauer et al., 2007), response latencies on incompatible-pairings tasks are longer compared to
those for other tasks, while latencies on compatible-parings
tasks are similar to those on non-combined task blocks (i.e.,
ITCD, AAD, and RTCD). To ensure replicability, the simulation was run ten times, and as can be seen from Table 2,
when the results are pooled across all ten simulations, the
pattern of results is the same.

Discussion
Propagation of activation from input nodes representing
verbal or pictorial stimuli to output nodes representing keypress responses occurs along multiple pathways. The pattern
of propagation is determined by the configurations of associations among target concepts and evaluative attributes, as
well as by the task mapping from these concepts to the response cues. Mutual reinforcement of compatible pathways
and inhibition between incompatible pathways both lead to
patterns of responses (including IAT effects) similar to
those observed in laboratory experiments.
One criticism of our model is that the connection weights
among concepts are arbitrary rather than empirically
grounded. With respect to the sign on these weights, we are
on safe ground because the only cases that could be in contention are the ones we manipulate in our four configurations. With respect to the magnitudes, one response would
be that while weights varied randomly within a reasonably
wide range, all subjects in the experimental conditions nevertheless showed IAT effects, suggesting that the actual
values are probably not critical. This might appear counterintuitive, but in fact it is consistent with data from the real
world indicating that thousands of people from all walks of
life (which can be thought of as an analog of randomly
distributed weights) routinely show IAT effects (Nosek,
Banaji & Greenwald, 2002).
One might be tempted to interpret the IAT effect as evidence for an implicit negative attitude towards the less preferred target concept. However, Greenwald et al. (1998)
carefully avoided any such claim, instead, always discussing

and POS, and weak positive associations (mean
0.2) between AFRICAN-AMERICAN and POS, and (f), the converse of (e). Consistent with the idea that the presence of an
IAT effect does not require the presence of a negative or
prejudicial attitude, IAT effects emerged despite there being
no connections to NEG, as shown in Figure 5. Clearly, it
would be impossible to test such a prediction using standard
experimental procedures because there would be no way of
knowing the positivity or negativity of subjects’ implicit
associations. We think that the fact that one can test through
simulation a prediction about implicit attitudes that could
not be tested empirically in the real world is an appealing
aspect of our approach.
So far, we have only focused on modeling automatic as
opposed to controlled processes. Therefore, issues related to
presumed discrepancies between implicit and explicit measures of attitudes, the role of selective attention (Fazio, 2001)
or self-presentation bias (Dasgupta et al., 2000) have not
been explored. Our intuition is that a second network operating on top of the first might make it possible to model
these more cognitively elaborated phenomena. Similarly,

the IAT effect in terms of a relative preference of one target
concept over the other, an issue explicitly raised by Brendl,
Markman, and Messner, (2001). In our terms, what really
matters is the relative differences in weights between target
concepts and their evaluative attributes. This being the case,
if the network were configured with no connections to NEG,
we would predict that an IAT effect might still be apparent,
provided that the connections to POS of the two target concepts differed sufficiently. In fact, we tested this possibility
by simulating two new groups, namely, (e) a group with

more work needs to be done to account for any effects on
response latencies that might result from task-switching
overheads (Klauer & Mierke, 2005) or from the dynamic remapping of valence to the left and right keys (De Houwer,
2001). These issues might be addressed by augmenting the
network with nodes representing IAT tasks that would modify connection weights between attitude objects and the Left
or Right response cues, instead of having the Task Mapper
assign these weights before each task.
Our work on the IAT effect is in the same spirit as models
of the Stroop effect (Cohen, Dunbar & McClelland, 1990)
and of various lexical effects in language processing (Ortony & Radin, 1989). Such models employ simple algorithms running on simple networks of associations between
representations in memory, but have the advantage of being
frugal with respect to the assumptions they have to make.
