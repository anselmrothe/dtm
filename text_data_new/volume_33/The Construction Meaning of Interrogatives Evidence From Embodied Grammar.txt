Embodied Grammar

Abstract: In formal semantics polar interrogatives are often conceived as pairs of a proposition and its negation
(Hamblin 1958). While allowing for interesting research, this view lacks plausible cognitive grounding. We therefore
propose that propositional contents are represented by pairs of situation tokens and situation types: In positive
declaratives the token fits (or fails to fit) the type, in interrogatives the question of fit does not arise because the
token is insufficiently specified. In order to test this assumption we adapted an embodied grammar experimental
design that demonstrated the actionâ€“sentence compatibility effect (ACE, Glenberg & Kaschak), the influence of the
motion described in the sentence subjects are primed with on the motor response they perform: If described and
performed motion match in direction, facilitation is observed, else inhibition. Our results are incompatible with the
Hamblin view: Interrogatives trigger an ACE between those of positive and negative declaratives.
