Abstract: Previous research suggests that individuals show orientation preferences when perceiving or judging
pictures of objects. Such preferences are typically attributed to cerebral lateralization effects. However, a laterality
account cannot explain differences in orientation preferences for different types of objects. In the present study of
aesthetic preference, 60 right-handed and 30 left-handed English-speaking participants were asked to photograph
six different objects—-iron, car, rhinoceros, airplane, teapot, and statue bust—-in what they thought was the most
aesthetically pleasing orientation. The objects were selected to differ in their implied motion, graspability, and
animacy. Across handedness groups, an overall rightward facing preference was found for objects with implied
motion and for animate objects; only one item (teapot) showed a differential effect of handedness (X2 = 5.383, p =
.020). Planned analyses will investigate more carefully the degree of object orientation in relation to handedness and
stimulus type (implied motion vs. graspable vs. animate).
