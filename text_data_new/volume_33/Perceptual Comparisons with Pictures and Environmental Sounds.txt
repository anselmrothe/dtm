Abstract: This research involves perceptual comparisons with cues that vary in one of four ways (picture, sound,
spoken word or printed word) and with targets that are either pictures or environmental sounds. Students were
required to match cue-target pairs and determine whether the 2 successive events represented features drawn from
the same item. Both the perceptual/linguistic format and the modality of the cue influenced responses to pictures
and environmental sounds, but the cue type effects were qualified by same/different response type and with picture
targets by left or right presentation location. These results provide some additional evidence of processing asymmetry
when pictures are directed to either the right or left hemisphere, as well as for some asymmetries in cross modal
cueing. Implications of these findings for theories of multisensory processing and models of object recognition are
discussed.
