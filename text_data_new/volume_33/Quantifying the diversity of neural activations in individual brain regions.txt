Abstract
This paper offers the first comprehensive characterization of
the cognitive diversity of individual brain regions. The results
suggest that individual brain regions—even fairly small
regions—contribute to multiple tasks across different
cognitive-emotional domains, and moreover that there is little
difference in diversity between cortical and sub-cortical
circuits.

Introduction
A common view in the cognitive neurosciences is that brain
areas are highly selective and exhibit considerable
specialization, with each neural region responding to a
restricted class of inputs and contributing primarily to a
single cognitive domain, such as language or motor control.
However, over the past several years this principle has come
under increasing critical scrutiny. For instance, although
Broca’s area is associated with language processing, it turns
out to also be involved in many different action- and
imagery-related tasks, including movement preparation
(Thoenissen et al. 2002), action sequencing (Nishitani et al.
2005), action recognition (Decety et al. 1997; Hamzei et al.
2003; Nishitani et al. 2005), imagery of human motion
(Binkofski et al. 2000), and action imitation (Nishitani et al.
2005; for reviews, see Hagoort 2005; Tettamanti & Weniger
2006). Similarly, visual and motor areas—long presumed to
be among the most highly specialized in the brain—have
been shown to be active in various sorts of language
processing and other higher cognitive tasks (Damasio &
Tranel 1993; Damasio et al. 1996; Glenberg & Kaschak
2002; Hanakawa et al. 2002; Martin et al. 1995; 1996; 2000;
Pulvermüller 2005). In light of such results, researchers
have started to question the boundaries between cognitive
domains once thought separate and distinct, such as
perception and cognition (Barsalou 1999; 2008) and
cognition and emotion (Pessoa 2008; 2010).
Recent meta-analyses of imaging results have tended to
support this emerging challenge. For example, Russell
Poldrack (2006) estimated the selectivity of Broca’s area by
performing a Bayesian analysis of 3,222 imaging studies
from the BrainMap database (Laird et al. 2005). He
concludes that current evidence for the notion that Broca’s
area is a “language” region is fairly weak, in part because it
was more frequently activated by non-language tasks than
by language-related ones. Similarly, a statistical analysis of
1,469 experiments from the NICAM database (Anderson et
al. 2010) demonstrates that most regions of the brain—even

fairly small regions—appear to be activated by multiple
tasks across diverse task categories (Anderson 2010). The
meta-results reported in that study also suggest that the brain
achieves its variety of function by putting the same regions
together in different patterns of functional cooperation, a
finding that appears also to question the long-standing belief
in the brain’s anatomical modularity (Coltheart 2001).
Such results suggest several novel research directions for
the cognitive sciences. For instance, if regions of the brain
are indeed put to many different cognitive uses, this
suggests that cortical parcellation and function-to-structure
mapping should be approached via multiple or cross-domain
investigations (Penner-Wilger & Anderson 2008; 2011).
This would be a contrast to current practice, in which
cortical regions are assigned visual functions by vision
researchers, memory functions by memory researchers,
attention functions by attention researchers, and so on
(Cabeza & Nyberg 2000). In addition, as we come to realize
which brain regions, in what combinations, contribute to
what tasks, the vocabulary of cognition—the way we
categorize and label experiments and mental operations—is
likely to need significant revision (Poldrack 2010).
These are big projects that will occupy the attentions of
many researchers for years to come. But the first, necessary,
and crucial step is to begin to get some sense of the actual,
specific diversity of various structures in the brain. Which
regions are more, and which less specialized? Are there
differences in diversity between large cortical regions, or
between cortical and sub-cortical structures? The current
paper begins to answer these questions by performing a
meta-analysis of 1,138 neuroimaging experiments taken
from 11 different task domains.

Methods
Materials
The NICAM database (Anderson et al. 2010) currently
contains information from 2,603 fMRI studies reported in
824 journal articles. All the studies involve healthy adults
and use a within-subjects, subtraction-based, whole-brain
design. That is, for all the studies in the database, brain
activity during an experimental task was observed over the
whole brain (not just a region of interest), and then
compared to and subtracted from activity observed in the
same participant during a control task. The logic of
subtraction method is such that it should uncover only the
regions of activation that support the specific mental
function that best captures the difference between the
experimental and control task. The neural activations
supporting the mental operation that the two tasks have in

2421

common—the visual process allowing one to see the stimuli
in a language task, for example—should be subtracted out.
The database lists, among other things, the cognitive domain
investigated in each study, using the BrainMap ontology
(Fox & Lancaster 2002), and the locations in Talairach
(Talairach & Torneau, 1988) and MNI (Evans, Collins &
Milner, 1992) space of the 21,553 post-subtraction fMRI
activation peaks observed during those 2,603 studies.

(always 0.091 with 11 categories) and k equals the number
categories. Diversity is (1-DV), normalized such that the
values range from 0 (all activations in one category) to 1
(activations spread equally across all 11 categories).

Procedure

The diversity of a region can also be considered from a
Bayesian perspective (Poldrack 2006).
Given the
observation of activity in one of these regions, how
confident can we be (what is the posterior probability that)
the activation is the result of a task in a domain of interest?

The general methodology for this sort of study is simple and
straightforward. First, choose a spatial subdivision of the
brain, then choose a subset of experimental domains to
investigate, and finally assign activations to each of the
spatial regions according to whether the activation peak fell
within the boundaries of that region. Spatial binning of
activations offers some of the advantages of spatial
smoothing, as well as providing orientation to accepted
anatomical structures. See (Wager et al. 2009; Wager et al.
2007) for further discussion. At this point the diversity of
activity in each region can be calculated, as described
below.
The analysis was performed at two levels of spatial
granularity. First, the brain was divided into 78 standard
anatomical regions based on Freesurfer data (Fischl et al.
2004). These regions are listed in table 1. Then these
regions were further sub-divided to form 1,052 smaller
regions. The cortical regions were sub-divided by breaking
the brain into equally spaced spheres with a radius of 10mm
by region; while the sub-cortical structures were divided
according to known anatomical structures (e.g. basal ganglia
was divided into caudate, claustrum, lentiform nucleus,
etc.), again according to Freeesurfer data.
The study was restricted to the following eleven task
domains: three action domains—execution, inhibition, and
observation—two
perceptual
domains—vision
and
audition—and six “cognitive” domains—attention, emotion,
language (semantics), explicit memory, working memory,
and reasoning. The result of this winnowing process left
1,138 experiments collectively reporting 7,408 locations of
peak activation falling within the brain regions defined
above. The number of activations in each region was
normalized to account for differences in the number of
experiments per domain in the entire sample.
Activation peaks are only one of many kinds of data that
could be used in such a meta-analysis. They have the
distinct advantage that large amounts of such data are
readily available, and certainly activation peaks contain a
great deal of useful information. See (Fox, Parsons &
Lancaster 1998; Kober & Wager 2010; Wager et al. 2009;
Wager et al. 2007) for further discussion of this and
alternate methods.
For each region, the diversity of activations was
calculated using a measure of diversity variability, based on
standard deviation, commonly used by to measure
demographic diversity in populations and neighborhoods
(Chang 1999; Byrne & Flaherty 2004). Diversity was only
measured for regions activated by 5 or more experiments.
In this equation, Cati refers to proportion of activations in
each category; mean refers to the average proportion

Here Az means an observation of activity in region z, and
Dx is the domain of interest. The posterior probability that
an observation of activity in region z indicates engagement
of a task in domain x depends on the probability of an
activation in z given a task in x, the prior probability that a
task in x is being engaged, the probability of an activation in
z when the brain is engaged in a task not in domain x, and
the general probability of engaging tasks not in x. For
current purposes, we assume no prior knowledge of the
likelihood of region z being activated by any domain, thus
the prior probability P(Dx) is set at 1/11 (0.091). The other
values are calculated in the standard way from the data. The
final number of interest is the Bayes factor, which is the
ratio of the posterior to the prior probability. Here we
calculate the Bayes factor assuming the domain of interest
for each region is the domain having the highest proportion
of activations in that region. In other words, we will be
calculating the degree of evidence for the best possible
scenario. By convention, a Bayes factor between 0 and 3
indicates weak evidence; between 3 and 10 moderate
evidence, and above 10 strong evidence (Jeffreys, 1961).
All values reported here were also calculated using an
alternate spatial subdivision of the brain formed by dividing
the brain into equally-spaced spheres of 10mm radius based
on a randomly seeded initial location. As these results did
not differ significantly from those reported here (indicating
the results are not an artifact of the subdivision), we report
only the results for the subdivision anchored to known
anatomical structures.

Results
The overall average diversity of the 78 large anatomical
regions was 0.70 (SD 0.12). The overall average diversity
of cortical regions was 0.71 (SD 0.11) and of subcortical
was 0.63 (SD 0.17). The average Bayes factor for the 78
large anatomical regions was 3.14 (SD 1.38). The average
Bayes factor for cortical regions was 3.08 (SD 1.23) and for
subcortical regions was 3.57 (SD 2.02). Individual values
are listed in table 1, and displayed in figure 1. Numbers in
parentheses indicate the number of experiments activating
the region.

To better evaluate these numbers, consider left inferior
temporal cortex, with a diversity of 0.70, equal to the overall
average. The proportion of activations in each of the task
domains is shown in table 2.
The overall average diversity of the 574 small cortical and
21 small subcortical regions activated by 5 or more
experiments was 0.52 (SD 0.13). Those 595 regions were
activated by an average of 10.67 experiments. The overall
average diversity of the cortical regions was 0.52 (SD 0.13)
and of the subcortical regions was 0.59 (SD 0.12). The
average Bayes factor for the 595 regions is 4.45 (SD 1.67).
The average Bayes factor for cortical regions is 4.43 (SD
1.68) and for subcortical regions is 3.68 (SD 1.11). With
595 regions, it is not possible to provide individual data
here. However, the full results will be posted at

Interestingly, only two of the 595 small regions had a
diversity of zero: a sub-region of right precentral gyrus
centered on Talairach coordinates [26, -22, 60] that was
active only in five action execution tasks; and a sub-region
of left postcentral gyrus centered on [-38, -31, 50] that was
active only in nine action execution tasks. The most diverse
small region, at 0.79, was a sub-region of left pars
triangularis, centered on [-41, 27, 8], that was active in 15
tasks across 8 of the cognitive domains (all except action
execution, action inhibition, and vision).

To get some better sense of typical small region diversity,
consider a sub-region of the right supramarginal gyrus,
centered at Talairach coordinates [44, -35, 39], that was
activated in nine experiments and had a diversity of 0.52.
Action imagination accounted for 42% of the activations;
27% were in action execution, 20% in reasoning and 11% in
working memory.
Although there do appear to be some interesting regional
asymmetries in diversity, there is no significant difference
between the average regional diversity of the left and right
hemispheres. There is a significant positive correlation
between diversity and the number of experiments activating
a region (r=0.50, p<.001 for large regions; r=0.46, p<.001
for small regions).

Discussion
Although there have been prior studies investigating the
selectivity of individual brain regions (Poldrack, 2006;
Tettamanti & Weniger, 2006; Gauthier et al., 2000) this is
the first study to offer a comprehensive survey of regional
selectivity in the brain. Overall, the results suggest that most
regions of the brain—even fairly small regions—typically
contribute to tasks across multiple cognitive-emotional
domains.
This reinforces the growing realization that reverse
inference—inferring what class of mental operation is being
engaged from observation of regional brain activity, e.g.
inferring an emotional process from observation of
amygdala activation—is an extremely uncertain practice
(Poldrack 2006). As we see from the Bayesian results, even
in the best case scenario where we assume no prior
knowledge, and consider only the strongest possible
evidence, such observations typically offer only fairly weak

to moderate support for such conclusions (Jeffreys, 1961).
Nevertheless, there does appear to be variability in
regional selectivity, and the full results will begin to allow
us to differentiate between regions for which reverse
inference might be appropriate, and those for which it is
clearly not. However, there is also considerable variation in
the amount of evidence for diversity in each region,
especially for the smaller regions. The positive correlation
between diversity and number of observed activations is not
surprising, as diverse areas will naturally be active more
often. What is not known is whether further observations
will tend to increase the measured diversity across the brain,
thus decreasing regional variability and hemispheric
asymmetries. Such matters deserve increased attention.
Although most regions of the brain do not appear to be
domain-selective, the current evidence is compatible with
the possibility that brain regions each perform a single,
specific mental operation that is used in performing many
different tasks (Anderson, 2010). Knowing the set of tasks
that activate each region will be an important source of
information for discovering whether such a possibility
obtains, and what the mental operations might be (PennerWilger & Anderson, 2011).
It is also possible that while individual regions are not
domain-selective, specific networks of regions are domainselective (Anderson et al. 2010; Sporns 2011). This
possibility, and the complementary possibility that it may be
possible to predict general mental states from observations
of network activation, will be one focus of future work.
However, these are, as they say, empirical questions. For
many researchers, the most natural interpretation of these
results will be that local neural circuits and distributed
networks can perform different operations under different
circumstances (Lloyd 2000; Hardcastle & Stewart 2002).
The cumulative results of years of functional neuroimaging
invite us to (cautiously) revisit some fundamental questions
about the functional organization of the brain.
