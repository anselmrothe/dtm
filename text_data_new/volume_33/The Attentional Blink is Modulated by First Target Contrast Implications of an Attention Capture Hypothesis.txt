Abstract
When two targets (T1 & T2) are presented in rapid
succession, observers often fail to report T2 if they attend
to T1. The bottleneck theory proposes that this attentional
blink (AB) is due to T1 occupying a slow processing stage
when T2 is presented. Accordingly, if increasing T1
difficulty increases T1 processing time, this should cause a
greater AB. The attention capture hypothesis suggests that
T1 captures attention, which cannot be reallocated to T2 in
time. Accordingly, if increasing T1 difficulty decreases T1
saliency, this should cause a smaller AB. In two
experiments we find support for an attention capture
hypothesis. In Experiment 1 we find that AB magnitude
increases with T1 contrast – but only when T1 is unmasked.
In Experiment 2 we add Gaussian noise to targets and vary
T1 contrast but keep T1‘s SNR constant. Again we find that
AB magnitude increases with T1 contrast.

Introduction
The attentional blink (AB) paradigm is widely used to
study temporal attention and refers to the finding that
observers often fail to report the second of two targets (T1
& T2) presented in rapid succession. Raymond, Shapiro
and Arnell (1992) reported that accuracy of T2 report is a
u-shaped function of the lag between T1 and T2 onset.
They systematically varied the time between a white letter
target (T1) and a black probe (T2, an ‘X’) embedded in a
rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream of black
letter distractors. When T2 was presented within 500 ms
of T1 observers rarely detected the probe. The AB has
predominantly been examined in the RSVP paradigm
where stimuli are presented central at fixation. However,
Duncan and colleagues (Duncan, Ward & Shapiro, 1994;
Ward, Duncan & Shapiro, 1996) used the two-target
paradigm where two masked targets are presented
consecutively in different locations. They observed a
phenomenon similar to the AB, which they referred to as
the attentional dwell time. Later Ward, Duncan and
Shapiro (1997) argued that the dwell time effect may be
the consequence of the location switch and not
comparable to the AB. To examine this they introduced
the skeletal paradigm where two consecutive masked
targets are presented in the same location. The authors

found a dwell time similar to what they observed with the
two-target paradigm, and suggested that all three
paradigms (RSVP, two-target, skeletal) tap a common
attentional limitation - an assumption that is adopted in
this study.
One theory offered to explain the AB is the bottleneck
theory (Chun & Potter, 1995; Jolicoeur, 1998). This
theory assumes two processing stages and suggests that
the AB occurs due to slow second stage processing
causing a perceptual bottleneck. The first processing stage
is rapid, analyzing target features such as color and form.
However, the first stage representation is volatile and
susceptible to both decay and interference from other
objects. In the second stage objects are consolidated and
transferred to more durable memories necessary for
conscious report. This stage is slow and capacity limited.
According to the bottleneck theory the AB occurs when
T2 requires second stage processing while T1 occupies
the second stage.
The bottleneck theory predicts that making T1
identification more difficult prolongs second stage
processing and consequently increases the AB (Chun &
Potter, 1995). This prediction has led to several studies
examining how T1 difficulty influences the AB. Target
difficulty can be approached in either a data limited or
resource limited fashion (Norman & Bobrow, 1975). Data
limited methods vary T1 difficulty by varying stimulus
attributes whereas resource limited methods do it by
varying the task or introducing distractors to occupy
attentional resources. Here we limit analysis to studies
using a data limited approach. McLaughlin, Shore and
Klein (2001) varied T1 exposure duration in three
conditions mixed within blocks in the skeletal paradigm
and observed no effect on the AB between conditions.
They suggested that data limited manipulations does not
affect the AB unless observers can prepare for a given
difficult level in advance and allocate resources
appropriately. Shore, McLaughlin and Klein (2001) later
replicated this study only this time they varied T1
exposure between blocks and found that increasing T1
exposure decreased AB magnitude, which is in
accordance to the bottleneck theory. A study by
Christmann and Leuthold (2004) reported similar results.
They varied T1 contrast in three conditions between
blocks in an RSVP stream and found that increasing T1
contrast decreases AB magnitude. That the effect of T1

2931

difficulty should depend so strongly on whether it is
varied within or between blocks may seem surprising, but
Shore et al. (2001) suggested that observers voluntarily
allocate more resources to T1 when they expect it to be
difficult to see, which is the case in a block of trials when
T1 is difficult to see. This leads to fewer resources being
allocated to T2 and hence to a larger AB. When T1
difficulty varies between trials, observers have no
expectation of whether the next T1 will be difficult or not
and hence do not change their allocation of attentional
resources between the targets, which is why there is no
effect of T1 difficulty on the AB. Contrary to the
predictions of the bottleneck theory, Chua (2005) found
that AB magnitude increased with T1 contrast in three T1
contrast conditions in a RSVP paradigm. Chua (2005)
concluded that a high contrast T1 captures attention, and
that this T1 attention capture prevents reallocation of
resources to T2 in time for its appearance.

Test of Attention Capture Hypothesis
In summary it appears that there are two competing
effects influencing the AB when varying T1 difficulty in a
data limited fashion. Making T1 easier to perceive either
by T1 exposure duration (Shore et al., 2001) or T1
contrast (Christmann & Leuthold, 2004) may decrease AB
magnitude. This may be due to a bottleneck effect or to
reallocation of attentional resources by means of strategy
as the effect depends strongly on T1 difficulty being
varied between blocks. However, making T1 easier to
perceive by increasing T1 contrast, may increase AB
magnitude by virtue of T1 attention capture (Chua, 2005).
Here we test the attention capture hypothesis in a new
set of experiments using the two-target paradigm (see
Figure 1). We vary T1 contrast and use adaptive staircase
procedures to control for T1 difficulty in individual
adjustments sessions. This allows us to systematically
examine how T1 difficulty affects the AB. In Experiment
1 we vary T1 difficulty by T1 contrast in two conditions,
such that T1 accuracy in an easy condition is
approximately 20% higher than in a hard condition.
According to the bottleneck theory a smaller AB should
be observed in the easy T1 condition, whereas the
attention capture hypothesis carries the opposite
prediction. Experiment 1 is subdivided into Experiment
1A and 1B, which differs by the presence or absence of
T1’s mask respectively. T1’s mask is omitted in
Experiment 1B because we are uncertain of how it affects
the AB under these conditions. In Experiment 2 we use
additive Gaussian noise to targets and aim to keep T1
difficulty constant between two conditions but vary T1
contrast. If T1 saliency is varied by this T1 contrast
manipulation, we may tease apart the effect of T1 capture
from the effect of T1 difficulty. According to the
bottleneck theory, no difference in AB effect should be
observed between T1 conditions since difficulty is kept
constant. The attention capture hypothesis however
suggests that if T1 contrast increases T1 saliency this
should cause an increase in AB magnitude.

Experiment 1
We varied T1 difficulty by T1 contrast in two conditions
such that T1 accuracy was 20% higher in an easy
condition than in a hard condition. T1’s mask was present
in Experiment 1A and absent in Experiment 1B.

Methods
Observers
We tested 19 naïve observers, 8 females and 11 males
between 18 and 28 years of age with a median age of 22
all with normal or corrected to normal vision. Observers
were students at the Technical University of Denmark
participating for an hourly fee, except for 2 who
participated out of collegial interest.
Design
We varied three factors in this experiment, T1 mask
[Present, Absent], SOA [100, 200, 300, 400, 600], and T1
difficulty [Easy, Hard]. T1’s mask varied between
Experiment 1A (Present) and 1B (Absent). SOA and T1
difficulty conditions were mixed within blocks in a full
factorial design. The sequential order of conducting
Experiment 1A and 1B was counterbalanced across
observers. Each letter in the target set appeared as T1 and
T2 with identical frequency. We used an adaptive
staircase procedure (accelerated stochastic approximation;
Treutwein, 1995) and adjusted proportions correct for
each observer to 0.5 in the T1 Hard condition, 0.8 in the
T1 Easy condition, and 0.5 in the T2 condition i.e. to the
same level as the T1 Hard condition. Experiment 1 was
structured in two (Experiment 1A) or three (Experiment
1B) individual-adjustment sessions of approximately 40
trials, one training session of 20 trials and four
experimental blocks each of 120 trials. For each
experiment (1A and 1B) the four experimental blocks
yields 480 trials and thus 48 repetitions in each SOA x T1
difficulty condition.

Figure 1: Two-target paradigm. T1 and T2 onsets are
separated by a varying stimuli onset asynchrony (SOA).
Targets appear in different boxes and have different
identities. Masks are presented after an inter-stimulus
interval (ISI) of 100 ms. The task for the observer is to
report the identity of both targets.

Stimuli
Target stimuli were 20 capital letters from the English
alphabet chosen to emphasize a homogenous yet still
varied target set. For this reason [C, I, Q, U, W, Y] were
excluded either because they diverge substantially (e.g. L
vs. W) or resemble other letters (e.g. O vs. Q). Stimuli
were presented as dark on a 25.6 cd/m2 grey background
with 8.2 cd/m2 fixation cross and boxes. Table 1 shows
target luminance and contrast statistics obtained in the
individual adjustment sessions. Thus standard deviations
are the standard error of mean across observers. Pattern
masks were moderate-density black dots with luminance
levels of 0.0 cd/m2. On each frame a dot pattern was
randomly generated and displayed. This creates a masking
effect perceived as if targets dissolved.
Table 1: Luminance, contrast and SNR levels for
Experiment 1 and 2. Weber’s contrast measures are used.
Negative contrasts imply towards dark visa versa. Large
differences in luminance and contrast levels between
Experiment 1 and 2 are due to that Gaussian noise was
added to targets in Experiment 2 thus making luminance
and contrast levels incomparable between Experiment 1
and Experiment 2.

Apparatus
A computer running the PsychoPy psychophysics
software (Peirce, 2007) controlled stimulus presentation
on a 15-inch View Sonic CRT monitor with a vertical
refresh rate of 100 Hz. Observers conducted the
experiment with a distance of approximately 75 cm from
the monitor, yielding a stimulus angle of 1.37 degrees for
targets and 1.76 degrees for masks.
Procedure
The AB was examined in the two-target paradigm with
four boxes arranged on an imaginary rectangle and a
fixation cross in the centre (see Figure 1). Two targets
were presented such that they had different identities and
appeared in different locations. In Experiment 1A both
targets were masked whereas in Experiment 1B T1’s
mask was omitted. Observers initiated a trial by pressing
space after which a blank interval of 100 ms followed. T1

was then presented for 10 ms. After 100 ms T1 was
followed by a pattern mask of 250 ms duration in
Experiment 1A. In Experiment 1B a blank interval took
the place of the pattern mask. T2 was presented for 10 ms
after a variable SOA interval from T1 onset. An ISI of
100 ms then followed before T2’s mask was presented for
250 ms. Observers were required to input the identity of
T1 and T2 on the keyboard in an unspeeded, forced
choice fashion with no regard to the presentation order of
targets. The experiments were conducted in a dimly lit
room. Prior to a session, observers adapted to the dim
lighting for 5 minutes. Experiment 1A and 1B were
conducted on different days, with approximately two
weeks in between.

Results
Experiment 1A
One observer showed no difference in T1 accuracy
between T1 conditions and was for this reason excluded
from the experiment. Thus 18 observers were used in the
analysis. The average of proportions corrects for T1
across SOA was 0.83 (std 0.02) for the T1 Easy condition
and 0.64 (std 0.03) for the T1 Hard condition, showing
that T1 difficulty was significantly varied [F (1,17) =
48.14, p < 0.001]. T2 results are plotted in Figure 2. An
AB is evident from a significant main effect of SOA [F
(4,68) = 13.61, p < 0.001]. However there is neither a
main effect of T1 difficulty [F (1,17) = 0.73, p = 0.41] nor
a T1 difficulty x SOA interaction effect [F (4,68) = 1.24, p
= 0.30] indicating that T1 difficulty has little effect on the
AB.

Experiment 1B
The average of proportions corrects for T1 across SOA
was 0.84 (standard error 0.02) for the T1 Easy condition
and 0.62 (standard error 0.02) for the T1 Hard condition
showing that T1 difficulty was significantly varied [F
(1,17) = 72.78, p < 0.001]. T2 results are plotted in Figure
3. An AB is evident from a main effect of SOA [F (4,68)

2933

= 18.70, p < 0.001]. There is no main effect of T1
difficulty [F (1,17) = 0.60, p = 0.45] however a T1
difficulty x SOA interaction effect was found [F (4,68) =
8.03, p < 0.001]. This justified simple effect analyses
revealing a simple main effect of T1 difficulty at SOA
200 ms [F (1,17) = 25.89, p < 0.001] after Bonferroni
correction.
Summary
When T1 was masked (Experiment 1A) we found no
effect of T1 difficulty on the AB. However, when T1 was
unmasked (Experiment 1B) AB magnitude increased with
T1 contrast at SOA 200 ms.

exceptions: We tested 22 naïve observers, 8 females and
14 males between 20 and 35 years of age with a median
age of 24 all with normal or corrected to normal vision.
Observers were students at the Technical University of
Denmark participating as part of the introductory
cognitive psychology course at the department. We varied
two factors: Six SOA conditions [100, 200, 300, 450, 600,
900] and two T1 contrast conditions [High, Low]. In the
adjustment sessions proportion correct for T1 was set to
0.6 in both the T1 High and the T1 Low condition. T2 was
set to 0.8. Gaussian noise was added to targets. The noise
was sampled from a contrast distribution with its mean
corresponding to the display background luminance,
which was 58.33 cd/m2. The noise standard deviation was
0.3 in the T1 High condition and 0.1 in the T1 Low
condition. T1 difficulty was equated with T1’s SNR. SNR
was calculated as the stimuli contrast divided by the
standard deviation of the noise. As in Experiment 1, T1
contrast was adjusted individually for observers for both
T1 conditions prior to the experiment. The corresponding
SNRs obtained from the T1 Low and T1 High adjustment
sessions varied slightly across conditions. Since we were
interested in presenting both T1 conditions with identical
SNRs, we used the mean SNR from these T1 adjustment
sessions to recalculate T1 contrast for both T1 conditions.
Figure 4 shows sample stimuli for the two T1 conditions
with identical SNR and different T1 contrast levels.
Targets plus noise were displayed at a visual angle of 1.76
degrees. Fixation cross and boxes was presented at 46.66
cd/m2. Luminance, contrast and SNR statistics are shown
in Table 1.

plotted for the T1 Hard and the T1 Easy condition. Error
bars signify standard error of the mean across observers.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 1 we varied T1 difficulty with T1 contrast
and found that an easy T1 increased AB magnitude when
T1 was unmasked. Increasing T1 contrast is likely to
increase T1 attention capture, which may explain the
increase in AB magnitude. In Experiment 2, we follow
this assumption and aim to tease apart the T1 capture
effect from the effect of T1 difficulty. In two T1
conditions we add Gaussian noise with different standard
deviation between conditions and manipulate T1 contrast
such that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is equal across
conditions. Targets with noise, where the noise have a
large standard deviation, requires a high contrast to
achieve a given accuracy level relative to targets with
noise sampled with a small standard deviation. Thus using
this type of manipulation we can increase T1 contrast
independently of T1 difficulty. Since we found no AB
effect of T1 difficulty in Experiment 1 when a pattern
mask followed T1 we let T1 be unmasked in Experiment
2.

Methods
The experimental configurations in Experiment 2, was
similar to those in Experiment 1 with the following

the T1 Low (left) and T1 High (Right) contrast conditions.
The stimuli have the same SNR, but different contrasts.
Rendering in print may affect the SNR. Left. SNR: 0.7,

contrast energy: 173.

Results
Three observers were excluded from the study because
they showed a difference in T1 accuracy between T1
conditions of more than 18% averaged across SOA. Thus
19 observers were used in the analysis. The average of
proportions corrects for T1 across SOA was 0.76
(standard error 0.04) for the T1 Low condition and 0.80
(standard error 0.03) for the T1 High condition. Despite
the increase in T1 accuracy was marginal, it was
consistent across observers thus leading to a T1 main
effect of difficulty [F (1,18) = 9.22, p = 0.007]. This

2934

indicates that T1’s SNR may not optimally determine T1
difficulty under these conditions.
T2 results are plotted in Figure 5. An AB was evident
from a main effect of SOA [F (5,90) = 2.56, p = 0.03]. T1
contrast x SOA produced no interaction effect [F (5,90) =
0.49, p = 0.79], however a main effect of T1 contrast [F
(1,18) = 5.54, p = 0.03] was observed.

kept T1’s SNR constant between conditions. Again we
found an effect on AB magnitude that increased with T1
contrast. The purpose with this paradigm was to keep T1
difficulty constant by keeping T1’s SNR constant. In this,
we did not succeed as the high contrast T1 was marginally
easier to perceive as measured by the proportion of
correct T1 identifications. Hence one might suggest that
bottleneck effects could have influenced this result.
However, as in Experiment 1, our results were opposite of
what the bottleneck theory would then predict. We found
a stronger AB when T1 contrast was high, which
happened to also be the condition where it was marginally
easier as seen in a higher proportion correct. Thus, our
findings unanimously support a strong effect of T1
saliency on the AB.

Discussion
This study indicates that attention capture to T1 modulates
the AB. In Experiment 1B we varied T1 difficulty by T1
contrast and found that an easy T1 increased AB
magnitude compared to a hard T1. This is the opposite of
bottleneck predictions, and of what Christmann and
Leuthold (2004) and Shore et al. (2001) found. However,
the finding is in line with Chua (2005) and supports the
attention capture hypothesis suggesting that a salient T1
engages attention such that it cannot be reallocated to T2
in time. We did not observe an AB effect of T1 contrast
when T1 was masked (Experiment 1A). This finding may
explain why other studies using pattern masks did not
report AB effects of T1 difficulty (McLaughlin et al.,
2001; Nielsen, Petersen and Andersen, 2009; Ward et al.,
1997). But how should we understand the effect of T1’s
mask? Pattern masks are typically jumbled feature
constructs shown in high contrast to interrupt target
processing after offset. It is likely that they engage
exogenous attention and thereby interferes with the effect
of T1 contrast. A study by Chua (2005) lends support to
this suggestion. Chua (2005) found that a to-be-ignored 5dot singleton construct appearing before a single target in
an RSVP stream produced an AB, and that AB magnitude
increased with singleton contrast. Thus it is likely that
T1’s mask captured attention in a similar fashion as the
singleton in Chua (2005), and that this capture effect
interfered with the effect of T1 contrast in Experiment 1A.
To test the effect of attention capture further, in
Experiment 2 we varied T1 contrast in two conditions but
