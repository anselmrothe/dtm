Abstract
The spatial-numerical association of response codes
(SNARC) effect provides evidence for perceptual simulation
of symbols. That is, parity judgments with one’s left hand are
faster for lower numbers than for higher numbers (with one’s
right hand, judgments are faster for higher numbers than for
lower numbers). A perceptual simulation account of the
SNARC effect leaves little room for a non-embodied
explanation, even though recent studies have demonstrated
that statistical linguistic data can explain findings from
various embodied cognition studies. The current study
explored whether such linguistic factors could also explain
the SNARC effect. In a response time experiment,
participants were asked to make parity judgments of number
words. Frequencies of those number words explained the
results just as well as a perceptual simulation explanation.
Moreover, collocation frequencies (the previous number word
and the following number word) also explained response
times, further demonstrating that linguistic factors might play
an important role in number processing. The results of this
experiment show that language encodes information that
could also be attributed to perceptual simulations.
Consequently, language users might well be using these
linguistic cues during number processing.

Introduction
Intuitively, number manipulation seems more symbolic than
perceptual in nature. The computing of numbers, after all,
does not require references to the symbols being
manipulated or a visual representation of the manipulation
process. Nevertheless, a spatial representation of numbers is
often thought to facilitate our understanding (Semenza,
2008). When participants are presented with small (1, 2, 3,
4) and large (6, 7, 8, 9) numbers, and are asked to make a
parity judgment, they are faster to respond to small numbers
with their left hand, and large numbers with their right. This
finding is known as the SNARC (spatial-numerical
association of response codes) effect (Dehaene, Bossini, &
Giraux, 1993; Wood, Nuerk, Willmes, & Fischer, 2008) and

suggests that comprehenders perceptually simulate the
representation of numbers. Importantly, subjects are not
making judgments that would call attention to number
magnitude, but instead, they are making a speeded parity
judgment. Purportedly, the SNARC effect occurs because
participants use mental representations to spatially represent
numbers on a number line. Furthermore, the SNARC effect
always seems to occur in the same direction as the
directional reading conventions of the subject’s culture (i.e.,
English speakers show a left-to-right SNARC effect while
Arabic speakers show the reverse effect) (Shaki, Fischer, &
Petrusic, 2009).
Researchers have replicated and modified the original
SNARC experiment to also demonstrate vertical effects (Ito
& Hatta, 2004), as well as right-to-left effects (i.e., opposite
of what is expected for English speakers) (Shaki et al.,
2009; Zebian, 2005) for other language groups. In fact,
Israelis, who read text from right-to-left and who read
numbers from left-to-right, show no SNARC effect at all
(Shaki et al., 2009). In addition, illiterate Arabic speakers
fail to show any SNARC effect (Zebian, 2005). Andres,
Ostry, Nicol, and Paus (2008) have shown that physical
manipulations of the subject (e.g., crossing hands, or using
grasping motions) do not influence the direction of the
effect. Yet others have found that the SNARC effect holds
when subjects are presented with two-digit numbers
(Dehaene et al., 1993; Reynvoet & Brysbaert, 1999) and
number words (Fias, 2001), however it is noted that in some
cases number word processing may increase response times
(RTs) relative to Arabic numeral processing (Dehaene et al.,
1993). Furthermore, although the effect may exist for
numbers, no such magnitude-based mental organizational
system is found for alphabetic letters (e.g., A, B, C, etc.)
(Zorzi, Priftis, Meneghello, Marenzi, & Umilta, 2006).
Interestingly, the SNARC effect does seem to be influenced
by processing strategies employed during the experimental
task. Subjects asked to imagine distance on a ruler
demonstrate a typical SNARC effect, whereas those who
instead imagine numbers representing time on a clock face

3437

show no such effect (Suzuki, Sugimoto, Tsuruo, Bachtold,
Baumuller, & Brugger, 1998).
Apart from simply expanding upon instances in which the
SNARC effect occurs and does not occur, various theories
explaining the effect have been offered. As number
representation is thought to be somewhat independent of
other language processes (Semenza, 2008), many
researchers have proposed a spatial representation
explanation of the SNARC effect. In other words, the
SNARC effect occurs because the mental representations of
numbers are spatially organized according to number
magnitude (i.e., numbers are placed on a mental number line
with small numbers on the left and large numbers on the
right) (Zorzi, Priftis, & Umilta, 2002). Although such an
explanation is succinct and even empirically supported
through neurological research (Zorzi et al., 2006), it fails to
account for how numbers are represented for language users
of specific groups that fail to show any SNARC effects
(e.g., Israelis and illiterate Arabic speakers).
Dehaene and colleagues (1993) have suggested that
instead of spatial representation being inherent in the
numbers themselves, the SNARC effect may be caused by
directional reading conventions. Further development of this
theory hypothesizes that the direction of recent spatial
processing be considered in addition to culturally
constrained conventional reading directions (Fischer, Shaki,
& Cruise, 2009).
Proctor and Cho (2006) claimed that the SNARC effect
occurs through the consideration of stimuli polarity.
According to a theory of number representation, small
numbers have a negative polarity whereas large numbers
have a positive polarity. Thus words and numbers are
represented along a positive-negative dimension in space. In
the instance of SNARC, the right side and large numbers are
associated with a positive polarity and the opposite is true
for the left side and small numbers. Bächtold, Baumüller,
and Brugger (1998) have posited that the SNARC effect
might be due to a learned embodied association between
numbers and actions (i.e., common patterns of motor
activation make use of the knowledge that the left side of a
keyboard possesses only small numbers whereas the right
possesses large numbers).
Even others suggest that two different processing routes
(a top-down conditional route and an automatic
unconditional route) work together simultaneously to help
us understand the stimuli being presented, therefore
accounting for RT differences among various numbers
(Gevers, Cassens, & Fias, 2005; Gevers, Lammertyn,
Notebaert, Verguts, & Fias, 2005). It is important to note
that despite differences between theories, most agree the
SNARC effect is, at least in some way, further evidence for
perceptual simulation during cognition.

Symbolic and Embodied Cognition
Many studies have demonstrated that cognition is embodied
(Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg, 1997; Pecher & Zwaan, 2005;
Semin & Smith, 2008). Proponents of the embodied

cognition account suggest that concepts and percepts are
understood through perceptually simulating external
experiences. In other words, according to this view, mental
representations are thought to be modality specific neural
reenactments of perception and action. Further, embodiment
theorists argue there is little room for the utilization of
symbolic representations during conceptual processing, such
as statistical linguistic variables, because mental
representations must always be grounded in bodily
experiences (Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002; Lakoff, 1987).
A number of perceptual features have been found to
facilitate conceptual comprehension. Implied perceptual
features such as shape, location, modality, orientation, and
direction (Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002; Šetić & Domijan,
2007; Stanfield & Zwaan, 2001; Zwaan & Yaxley, 2004)
that facilitate language comprehension have led to views of
embodied cognition that reject symbolic accounts (Glenberg
& Kaschak, 2002; Lakoff, 1987; van Dantzig, Pecher,
Zeelenberg & Barsalou, 2008). The ready dismissal of nonperceptual explanations in cognition is somewhat surprising,
given the evidence summarized in Paivio’s (1986) Dual
Coding Theory. Paivio and colleagues demonstrated in a
range of experimental studies that cognitive processes
involve both verbal and non-verbal representations.
Accordingly, words may be stored in memory as a set of
embodied simulations or as a set of abstract linguistic
representations, based on a variety of factors (e.g.,
individual differences, concreteness, task demands, etc.).
Louwerse (2007; 2010) proposed the Symbol
Interdependency Theory. According to this theory language
encodes perceptual relations (Louwerse, 2008), and
language users take advantage of these linguistic cues
during cognition. For shallow processing, language users
primarily rely on linguistic representations, whereas for
deep processing they rely more on perceptual simulations
(Louwerse & Jeuniaux, 2010). For instance, Louwerse
(2008) tested whether the finding that the word pair flowerstem, presented one above the other, yielded faster response
times because participants were perceptually simulating the
word pair, or because of the word order. Spatially higher
items were found to precede lower items (the frequency of
word pairs such as flower-stem is significantly higher than
word pairs stem-flower), and the linguistic frequencies
explained response times better than perceptual ratings.
Louwerse (2008) replicated the effect for linguistic
frequencies when the two words were presented
horizontally, next to each other.
The experimental evidence supporting the Symbol
Interdependency Theory allows for the possibility that the
SNARC effect could also be attributed to statistical
linguistic factors. To test for this possibility, we conducted a
SNARC response time study. As in most SNARC studies,
we asked participants to evaluate whether numbers were
even or odd, by responding using their left or right index
finger. However, instead of presenting Arabic numerals we
opted for number words.

3438

The rationale for using number words was that a) if the
SNARC effect could have a linguistic basis, we should be
able to first and foremost find it in words and b) although
making parity judgments regarding number words may
seem to be more difficult than making parity judgments
about Arabic numerals, still number words have shown to
yield a SNARC effect (Fias, 2001).
Admittedly, there is evidence that number words and
Arabic numerals are processed in different ways (Damian,
2004; Fias, 2001). However, past research has suggested
that number word presentation shows few differences from
traditional Arabic numeral presentation in a SNARC
experiment (Nuerk, Iversen, & Willmes, 2004).
Furthermore, as we exclusively presented number words,
any variations in RTs should be systematic across all parity
judgments, and are thus of little consequence.
Because language encodes embodied representations, we
hypothesized a strong correlation between the perceptual
ordering of the numbers and their frequencies. Moreover,
we hypothesized that these frequencies would explain the
results as well as (or better than) a perceptual simulation
account. Finally, we hypothesized that if linguistic factors
explain the SNARC effect, the collocation frequencies of
paired number words (e.g., one preceding two, one
following two) would also impact processing time.

Procedure
In both conditions, number words were presented in the
center of an 800x600 resolution computer screen running Eprime software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc.,
Pittsburgh, PA). Participants were asked to make a parity
judgment as quickly and as accurately as possible after each
number word was presented on the screen. Depending on
which condition they were assigned to, participants
responded to either even or odd number words with the left
index finger (by pressing the ‘F’ key) and with the right
index finger (by pressing the ‘J’ key).
Once a participant responded, the symbol ‘+’ would
appear as a fixation point in the center of the screen for
1000 msecs, then the next number word would appear.
Trials consisted of two separate number word presentations
followed by a short beep. Participants were instructed to
press the spacebar when they heard the beep to progress to
the next trial pair. Number words within an experimental
session were randomly presented for each participant in
order to negate any order effects. Each participant saw every
combination of number word pairs one through nine
(excluding five) in each condition. To ensure participants
understood the task, a session of six practice trials preceded
the experimental session.

Results

Experiment
The current experiment investigated whether linguistic
factors could be considered as a possible alternative
explanation for the SNARC effect. Subjects participated in a
standard SNARC experiment by making parity judgments
about number word stimuli while their response times with
their left and right hand were recorded.

Methods
Participants
Fifty-seven University of Memphis undergraduate students
participated for extra credit in a psychology course. All
participants had normal or corrected vision, were right
handed, and were native English speakers. Twenty-seven
participants were randomly assigned to respond to even
numbers with their left hand and to odd numbers with their
right hand, and thirty participants were randomly assigned
to respond to odd numbers with their left hand and to even
numbers with their right hand.

Stimuli
Each experiment consisted of 130 trials, with each trial
including one number word. Number words included ranged
from one to nine, but, as is convention in SNARC
experiments, five was excluded (Tzelgov, Meyer, & Henik,
1992). Importantly, trials were paired such that each number
word was paired with every other number word, in both
orders (i.e., participants would see one followed by three, as
well as three followed by one).

Five participants were removed from further analysis
because >14% of their answers were incorrect. The total of
52 participants were now equally distributed between the
response conditions, with 26 participants in each condition.
The average error rate was 5%. In addition, outliers were
identified as 2.5 SD above the mean RT per participant per
condition. Errors and outliers were removed from the
analysis, affecting 6.5% of the initial data.
A mixed-effect regression model was conducted on RT
with response side and number magnitude as fixed
predictors and subject and item as random predictors
(Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008; Richter, 2006). The
model was fitted using the restricted maximum likelihood
estimation (REML) for the continuous variable (RT). F-test
denominator degrees of freedom were estimated using the
Kenward-Roger’s degrees of freedom adjustment to reduce
the chances of Type I error (Littell, Stroup, & Freund,
2002).
A main effect was found for response side with faster
response times for right handed responses compared to left
handed responses, F(1, 5815.85) = 6.57, p = .01. This result
is not surprising, given that all participants were righthanded.
As described earlier, the SNARC effect stems from the
interaction between faster responses for lower numbers with
the left hand, and faster responses for higher numbers with
the right hand. This is exactly what was found. An
interaction between response side (left or right handed
response) and number magnitude (one, two, three, … nine)
reached significance, F (1, 5816.93) = 3.26, p = .04.
