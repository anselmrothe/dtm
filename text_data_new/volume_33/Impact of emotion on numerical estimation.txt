Abstract

and non-humans and may perhaps rely on a
common mechanism (e.g., Bueti and Walsh,
2009; Cantlon et al., 2009; Meck and Church,
1983; Walsh, 2003). Despite this burgeoning
body of work documenting the similarities
between numerical and temporal processing, a
distinct gap in our knowledge of number
representation remains: What is the effect of
emotion on numerical representations?

Research has demonstrated that both attention
and emotion influence temporal perception.
Even though behavioral findings support a
common system for temporal and numerical
estimations, no research has investigated the
impact of emotion on numerical estimation or
the role that attention plays in that process.
Using a numerical bisection task, the current
research investigated enumeration of emotional
events (Study 1) as well as the influence of
attentional distraction (Study 2). Overall, (1) the
number of emotional faces is underestimated
compared to the number of neutrally valenced
faces, and (2) when attention is divided, the
number of negatively valenced faces is
underestimated. Emotional stimuli may capture
attention more rapidly, and as such, increase
enumeration accuracy.

Common Representation of Number and Time
Different
magnitudes
may
be
represented similarly in both behavioral and
neural systems by humans and non-human
animals, such as brightness, size, time, length,
and number, with Weber’s Law underlying the
format of all such nonverbal representations.
(e.g., Cantlon et al., 2009; Hubbard et al., 2005).
One possibility for a mechanism that organisms
use to represent both time and numerical stimuli
is the mode-control model, a serial process that
represents continuous magnitudes directly
analogous to the quantities they represent (Meck
and Church, 1983; Meck, Church, and Gibbon,
1985). Comprising this model are a pacemaker,
an accumulator, a working memory buffer,
reference memory, comparator, and a mode
switch that allows the model to either time or
count. First, pulses are gated into the
accumulator at stimulus onset by one of three
different modes, depending on the nature of the
stimulus: (1) In the run mode, the initial
stimulus starts an accumulation process that
continues until the end of the signal or trial
(allowing the organisms to estimate duration);
(2) in the stop mode, the process occurs

Introduction
Emotions play a critical role in human
functioning and have been considered by some
as the primary motivational system in humans,
involved in organizing cognition, perception,
and action (e.g., Izard, 1977; Tomkins, 1962,
1963). Because of the important role emotions
have been hypothesized to serve in assisting
individuals with successfully navigating their
physical and social environments, certain
researchers have addressed how emotions affect
perception. It is known that time and number
share common behavioral signatures in humans

3552

whenever the stimulus is physically present
(allowing the organism to estimate duration); (3)
in the event mode, each onset of the stimulus
produces a relatively fixed duration of the
process regardless of stimulus duration
(allowing the organism to represent number). All
three of these different modes illustrate how the
mode control model is used for both temporal
perception and enumeration of stimuli. Next, the
accumulator value is transferred to working
memory or reference memory. Finally, the
organism subsequently compares the current
value in the accumulator with the value(s) in
reference memory to determine what type of
response- either temporal or numerical- is
appropriate.
Evidence that the same mechanism, the
mode control model, could be used for both time
and number can be found across a variety of
animal species (e.g. Fetterman, 1993; Meck
&Church, 1983; Meck, Church & Gibbon, 1985;
Roberts, Coughlin, & Roberts, 2000; Santi &
Hope, 2001). Meck and Church (1983) showed
that rats encode both time and number when the
two dimensions are confounded. Rats were
trained on a duration bisection task that
confounded the number of cycles of each stimuli
with the duration of each stimuli in seconds.
During test, (1) the duration of the stimuli was
held constant while the number of cycles varied
or (2) number of cycles was held constant while
duration. Rats’ behavior in either scenario was
modulated by whichever stimulus dimension
varied, showing that they had encoded both
duration and quantity of the stimuli.
In the mode control model, an
attentional
system—which
can
allocate
differential resources to incoming stimuli—is
added to the mode switch, helping explain
erroneous estimations of time and number. For
example, research suggests that attentional
distraction can either delay the mode switch
closing or prematurely open it, resulting in a net
loss of pacemaker pulses. Buhusi and Meck
(2005, 2006, 2009) reported that when
reallocation of attention occurs- through the use
of distracters and/or gaps- timing is delayed.
This loss of pulses in the accumulator results in
a consistent underestimation of time (Buhusi &
Meck, 2006, 2009; Coull, et al., 2004; Meck &
MacDonald, 2007). Overall, these results

support a common system of timing and
number- the mode control model- that is
influenced by attention distraction through the
mode switch, causing underestimation of
duration.
Effects of emotion on attention and temporal
processing
Emotional salience can significantly
impact attentional priority, with highly
emotional stimuli directing both conscious and
unconscious attention away from neutral stimuli
(Taylor & Fragopanagos, 2005). Emotional
stimuli have been shown to: (a) be more
accurately and rapidly detected than neutral
stimuli, regardless of the number of neutral
distracters (Ohman, Flykt, & Esteves, 2001), (b)
remain more detectable within an attentional
blink paradigm, even persisting past the point at
which neutral stimuli become minimally
detected (Anderson & Phelps, 2001), and (c)
capture automatic attention earlier than neutral
stimuli when measured by event-related
potentials (Carretie et al., 2004). Overall,
previous findings demonstrate how both
detected and undetected emotional stimuli
impact cognitive and neural processes involved
with attention.
Recent
findings
have
provided
substantial evidence that emotions also impact
temporal processing by causing overestimation
of the duration of emotional: (a) events (Meck,
1983; Stetson, Fiesta, & Eagleman, 2007), (b)
faces (Droit-Volet, Brunot, & Niedenthal, 2004,
Gil, Niedenthal, & Droit-Volet, 2007), and (c)
other stimuli (Angrilli, et al., 1997). When
experiencing stressful events, such as foot
shocks (Meck, 1983), and forcing eye contact
with an angry face (Schiff & Thayer, 1970),
higher arousal level is hypothesized to increase
the pacemaker’s speed, thereby impacting the
number of pulses acquired in the accumulator.
Droit-Volet and colleagues (2004, 2007) have
investigated how perception of emotion (anger,
happiness, or sadness) in human facial
expression impacts temporal perception in a
duration bisection task. Participants are first
trained to discriminate between two anchor
durations (short vs. long). They are then required
to classify intermediate durations as being more
similar to the short or long anchor durations.

Participants consistently underestimated neutral
compared to emotional faces. Overall, research
supports that emotional stimuli are timed
differently than neutral stimuli (e.g., Angrilli,
Cherubini, and Pavese, 1997; Droit-Volet,
Brunot, and Niedenthal, 2004; Gil, Niedenthal,
and Droit-Volet, 2007; Watts and Sharrock,
1984). but enumeration of emotional events has
not been investigated.

presented in testing trials consisted of the same
small, medium, and large sizes used in the
practice but included (1) angry, (2) happy, and
(3) neutral female faces. All faces used had been
previous coded for purity of expression (Tracey,
et.al., 2009). In both phases, varying the position
of presentation on an invisible 12 x 12 grid
randomized the position of the stimulus.
Procedure
Participants were instructed to sit
comfortably in front of the keyboard and to use
two hands when responding to the task. A
numerical bisection task was presented with two
trial phases: (1) practice, and (2) testing.
Participants pressed the space bar to initiate each
trial.
In the practice phase, neutrally valenced
stimuli were presented in a large (24) or small
(6) quantity. Participants were instructed to press
the ‘d’ key if the quantity of stimuli was closer
to 6 or the ‘k’ key if the quantity was closer to
24. Twelve trials were presented for each
quantity, and feedback was given after each trial.
Positive feedback consisted of a visual display
of “Correct!” on the screen for 1500 ms, while
negative feedback consisted of “Incorrect” for
1500 ms. Participants were then instructed to
press the spacebar to begin the next trial. In the
testing trials, feedback was eliminated, and
valenced faces were also presented as the stimuli
to be enumerated. Nineteen quantities, ranging
between 6 and 24, were presented in random
order. Each quantity had four presentations of
each valence (angry, happy, and neutral), 12
trials for each quantity, for a total of 228 test
trials.

Current Research
While
previous
research
has
demonstrated that (a) duration of neutral events
are underestimated compared to emotional
events, (b) attentional distraction influences time
causing underestimation, and (c) a common
mechanism may be used for both time and
number, no research has investigated
enumeration of emotional events or the role that
attentional distraction plays in this process.
Using a numerical bisection task, the current
research investigated enumeration of emotional
events (Study 1) as well as the influence of
attentional distraction (Study 2).
Methods-Study1
Participants
Participants (n = 61) consisted of
undergraduates in psychology classes at Utah
State University. Participants received course
credit for participating.
Materials: Apparatus and Stimuli
All participants completed a computerbased numerical bisection task that presented
facial stimuli and recorded keyboard responses
using E-Prime over the course of approximately
30 minutes. The experiment was run on a Dell
Optiplex 755 computer with a 21-inch monitor
in a dimly lit room.
Participants sat
approximately 45 cm from the display.
Participants made all responses using a
keyboard.
So that numerosity did not always covary with other quantitative properties such as
surface area, three stimulus sizes were used
within each stimulus set. The stimuli presented
during the practice trials were neutrally valenced
and consisted of small (8 x 11 cm), medium (22
x 16 cm), and large (44 x 32 cm) female face
photographs (Tracy, et.al., 2009). The stimuli

Results
For the training phase, all participants
performed on or above 90% demonstrating an
understanding of the task. For the testing phase,
the proportion of large responses was calculated
for each participant separating each score by
quantity and stimuli valence (i.e. 6 angry
stimuli). To evaluate any significant differences
between numerical estimations of different
emotional facial expressions, a non-linear
regression analysis was performed for each
group of emotionally valenced stimuli (happy,
angry, and neutral) [model: Y=1/(1+[x/T50]^-

E)] to acquire the numerical sensitivity (slope,
E) and bias (point of subjective equality, PSE)
for each participant. These values were
compared using a repeated measures ANOVA.
Consistent with previous timing
literature, no significant differences in
sensitivity to change in number (k) were found
(p = .1621). A significant difference in PSE was
found (F (2,60) = 6.459, p = .0022) with angry
faces being significantly underestimated
compared to numerical estimations of neutral
faces (t(60) = 2.800 , p< .05.; angry: M = 12.90,
neutral: M = 12.47) and (b) happy faces
significantly underestimated compared to
numerical estimations of neutral faces (t(60) =
3.352, p<.05 ; happy: M = 12.98, neutral: M =
12.47). No significant differences between angry
and happy faces were found (t (60) = 0.5521,
p>.05). Overall, higher estimations of number
were found for emotionally valenced faces
compared to neutral ones supporting that
perception of emotion causes a rightward shift of
psychophysical functions of participants’
numerical estimation.

Materials: Apparatus and Stimuli
All participants completed the same
computer-based numerical bisection task used in
Study 1. A concurrent attentional distracter task
was run on a Dell Latitude D830 laptop with a
15.4-inch monitor. Two numbers, between 1 and
9 (e.g. 4 5), were presented in 18 size font on the
center of the screen. Participants were instructed
to press the spacebar every time the numbers
added up to 10 or more. Once the spacebar was
pressed the number immediately progressed to
the next set. If the numbers did not add up to 10
or more the numbers automatically progressed to
the next set after 2000 ms. Participants made all
responses using the laptop keyboard.
Procedure
Similar to Study 1, participants were
asked to sit comfortably in front of both
computers. Prior to the numerical bisection task
each participant was given verbal instruction on
the attentional distraction task and asked to
complete five practice trials with feedback
presented for 1500 ms. Feedback consisted of
“Correct!” every time (a) the two numbers added
up to 10 or more and the spacebar was pressed
or (b) the numbers did not add up to 10 or more
and the participant waited for the next number
set to be presented. Feedback of ‘Incorrect” was
presented for all other trials. The feedback was
eliminated in test. Next, participants completed
the numerical bisection task practice trials. Upon
completion of each practice session the
researcher instructed the participant that they
would be performing both tasks concurrently.
Furthermore, the participant was instructed to be
as accurate as possible on the attentional
distraction task. When the numerical bisection
task was complete the session was finished.

Discussion
Study 1 found that emotional stimuli
produced underestimation of number. Emotional
stimuli capture attention more rapidly than
neutrally valenced stimuli (Baumeister et al.,
2001; Ito et al., 1998), possibly accounting for
the similarities between attentional distraction
and perception of emotion on enumeration.
Study 2 was thus designed to tax attentional
allocation to stimulus enumeration and therefore
evaluate the role of attention on enumeration of
emotional stimuli. Furthermore, the small mean
difference found between enumeration of
emotional and neutral stimuli in Study 1 may be
due to a possible ceiling effect. As such,
attentional distraction will increase the difficulty
of the task.

Results
Again, all participants performed on or
above 90% in practice demonstrating an
understanding of the task. For the testing phase,
within-subject analyses found significant
differences in PSE (F(2,27)= 5.093, p = .00094)
with (1) happy faces being significantly
overestimated compared to angry faces (t(27) =
4.040, p < .05; angry: M = 12.37, happy; M =
11.60), (2) happy faces being significantly
overestimated compared to neutral faces (t(27) =

3.763, p <.05; happy; M = 11.60, neutral; M =
12.32), and (3) no significant difference between
angry and neutral faces (t(27) = .02770, p >.05).
Post hoc rating (1 being negative, 10 being
positive) of the three emotional faces suggests
that participants perceived neutral faces (M =
5.2) to be closer in valence to angry (M = 2.5)
than happy (M = 9.5) with a larger difference
between neutral and happy (4.0) compared to
neutral versus angry (2.9).

Discussion
Study 2 taxed attentional allocation and
found significant underestimation of the number
of neutral and negative faces compared to happy
faces. Furthermore, a post hoc rating suggests
that the neutral stimuli were perceived to be
closer to angry than happy, creating a possible
explanation for the similarity in enumeration of
angry and neutral faces.
The tendency for negative faces to
capture attention more rapidly is seen in the
literature
with
participants
attending
preferentially and being more sensitive to
negative over other types of information
(Baumeister, et. al., 2001). Furthermore, extreme
negative images produce larger amplitude late
positive potentials as measured by ERP’s than
do equally extreme positive images in young
adults (Ilt, et al., 1998).
Future studies can further investigate the
role of attention and emotion on the modecontrol model by evaluating attentional
distraction during temporal perception of
perceived emotion.
