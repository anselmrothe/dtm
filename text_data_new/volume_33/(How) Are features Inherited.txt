Abstract: Two experiments provide evidence that our conceptual systems represent hierarchical relations between
concepts in more than one way. Specifically, hierarchical relations may be represented via criteria inclusion or kind

mediate feature inheritance in systematically different ways. Furthermore, it appears that the inheritance of kproperties differs in systematic ways from that of t-properties
