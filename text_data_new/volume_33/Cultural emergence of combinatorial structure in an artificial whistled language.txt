Abstract

such a hypothesis. However, recently research on emerging
sign languages, studies of computer simulations and experiments with human subjects have provided evidence that can
shed light on this hypothesis.
Research on a newly emerging sign language, Al-Sayyid
Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL), provides a potential challenge to Hockett’s hypothesis of the emergence of phonological structure (Israel & Sandler, 2009; Sandler, Aronoff,
Meir, & Padden, 2011). All established sign languages that
have been analyzed have been shown to exhibit phonological
structure with features of discreteness and recombination as
in spoken systems. There is a discrete set of location, hand
shape and movement features that are recombined into meaningful words and there are constraints on the ways in which
features can be combined. ABSL is a young but already fully
functional sign language in which the phonological structure
does not appear to be fixed yet. This case questions whether
the emergence of combinatorial structure is necessarily driven
by a growing meaning space alone, because the language is
fully functional without such structure.
The case of ABSL is rare and the language may change
towards using combinatorial structure in future generations.
This expectation is supported by several computer models
which have shown that sound systems tend to develop discrete building blocks or combinatorial structure through selforganization in a population of interacting agents (de Boer,
2000; Oudeyer, 2002, 2005). De Boer and Zuidema (2010)
simulated the transition from a system of holistic signals to a
combinatorial system in this way. They introduced an important distinction between two types of combinatorial structure:
‘superficial combinatorial structure’, which is structure that
can be identified by an outsider observing the system, but of
which the users of the system are not aware; and ‘productive
combinatorial structure’, which is structure that is actively
used in production, perception, learning or storage of signals
(de Boer & Zuidema, 2010). Only superficial combinatorial
structure can be observed in this simulation, since it is hard to
tell whether the agents are aware of it. Therefore, to be able
to study active use of the system, we need to observe human
behavior.
Kirby, Cornish, and Smith (2008) developed a novel exper-

Speech sounds within a linguistic system are both categorical
and combinatorial and there are constraints on how elements
can be recombined. To investigate the origins of this combinatorial structure, we conducted an iterated learning experiment
with human participants, studying the transmission of an artificial system of sounds. In this study, participants learn and
recall a system of sounds that are produced with a slide whistle, an instrument that is both intuitive and non-linguistic. The
system they are exposed to is the recall output of the previous participant. Transmission from participant to participant
causes the system to change and become cumulatively more
learnable and more structured. This shows that combinatorial
structure can culturally emerge in an artificial sound system
through iterated learning.

Introduction
In human languages, a finite set of basic speech sounds
(phonemes) is combined into a (potentially) unlimited set of
well-formed morphemes (words, clitics, grammatical markers etc.). Hockett (1960) placed this phenomenon under the
umbrella of ‘duality of patterning’ and listed it as one of the
basic design features of human language. Such combinatorial
structure requires a continuous signal space to be organized
into a discrete set of basic building blocks that are reused in a
systematic way (Oudeyer, 2006). In addition, there are constraints (e.g. phonotactic) on the ways the basic elements can
be recombined. The specific building blocks and the rules for
their recombination differ from one language to the other, but
are shared among all members of a speech community. This
paper presents an experimental investigation into how combinatorial organization of (acoustic) signals may have emerged.
Hockett (1960) suggested a possible advantage for a language that uses combinatorial structure: If there is a limit on
how accurately signals can be produced and perceived, there
is a practical limit to the number of distinct signals that can be
discriminated. When a larger number of meanings needs to be
expressed, structured (sequential) recombination of elements
is needed to maintain clear communication. Not much data
was available to Hockett regarding the origins of combinatorial structure that could be used as evidence in favor or against

After each learning phase, a recall phase followed in which
they reproduced all twelve whistles without being able to listen to them again. After the fourth recall phase, the output of this last recall round became the input set for the
next participant. For the recall procedure, we set in place a
strategy to prevent participants from reproducing the same
whistle twice. The user interface of the experiment automatically compares each new whistle produced to all other
whistles already accepted and stored during that phase and
it rejects that whistle if it was too similar to any other. To
determine how close two whistles are, we defined a whistle distance measure. This measure is a weighted combination of several separate measures: the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) (Sakoe & Chiba, 2003) distance between the two
pitch tracks (D p ), the DTW distance between the two intensity tracks (Di ), the difference in the number of segments
(separated by silent pauses) (Ds ), the difference in variation
of segment duration (Dsd ) and the difference in variation of
pitch (D pv ). These separate measures were scaled to have
approximately a maximum value of one and then combined
following: 0.5D p + 0.2Di + 0.2Ds + 0.05Dsd + 0.05D pv . Data
collected in a pilot study was used to create this measure and
to find the set of weights that resulted in the highest whistle
recognition score. The rejection threshold was set at 0.06, a
low value because it was not supposed to influence the outcome of the recall phase in any way other than to reject doubles.

imental paradigm: iterated learning with humans. This approach makes it possible to investigate the effects of cultural
evolution on a transmitted (artificial) language in a controlled
laboratory setting. This has the advantage over computational
simulations that it does not abstract away from the complexities of human learning, though it still allows for control over
environmental factors and the parameters of the artificial language. Such control is not possible when studying a language
in the field. Iterated learning refers to (repeated) acquisition
of a behavior by a person through observation of similar behavior by another person who acquired it in the same way
(Kirby et al., 2008). In the experimental paradigm a chain of
learners is created in which the outcome of the learning process of one participant is used as the input for the next person
(Kirby et al., 2008). Passing through the minds of learners,
the system that is being transmitted is expected to adapt to
the learning biases, expectations and constraints of the learners (Deacon, 1997; Kirby & Hurford, 2002; Christiansen &
Chater, 2008; Griffiths, Kalish, & Lewandowsky, 2008).
This idea is not new, having been successfully used in numerous computer simulations and, more recently, in behavioral experiments. In experiments it has been applied successfully to show the emergence of compositional structure
(Kirby et al., 2008), combinatorial structure in visual symbols (del Giudice, Kirby, & Padden, 2010), predictability in
plural marking (Smith & Wonnacott, 2010) and in other category or function learning tasks (Griffiths et al., 2008). We applied the same paradigm to study the emergence of combinatorial structure in an artificial whistled language. If structure
emerges, it allows us to see whether people make productive
use of it by observing their learning and production. We expected that an increase in productive combinatorial structure
would result in a cumulative increase in learnability as well as
a cumulative increase of superficial combinatorial structure.

The experiment described here involves learning twelve different signals using a slide whistle (see figure 1). We use slide
whistles for sound production, because participants can easily use them to produce a rich repertoire of acoustic signals,
while only very little interference from pre-existing linguistic
knowledge is expected.

Participants
Forty participants took part in four parallel chains of ten generations of learning and reproduction. This is schematically
shown in figure 2. All participants were university students
from either University of California San Diego, or University
of Amsterdam, ranging in age from 18 to 32 (mean age of
22).

Procedure
The participants completed four rounds of learning and recall. In the learning phase they were exposed to all twelve
whistle sounds one by one, and were asked to imitate each
sound with the slide whistle immediately after hearing it.

Initial input whistles
All four chains started with the same initial set of twelve
whistles, which were selected from a large database of whistles that were collected from nine participants in a pilot study.
These participants were asked to freely produce a number of
whistles. We selected a set of signals that uses a wide range of
whistle techniques (e.g. slides, siren-like, staccato) such that
the total set of whistles did not exhibit (superficial) combinatorial structure. A few examples are shown in figure 3, plotted as pitch tracks on a semitone scale using Praat (Boersma,
2001).

If we take a close look at what happens over the course of
the chains, there are a few recall behaviors that seem to lead
to an increase of structure. Remembering twelve whistles after only four exposures is difficult, so participants generally
don’t recall all of them flawlessly. They seem to overgeneralize some of the (superficial) combinatorial structure that
appears to be present. This results in an introduction of whistles which are related in form to other whistles learned: some
of these whistles are inverted versions of learned whistles and
others combine or repeat elements that are borrowed from existing whistles. As a result of this, whistles begin to share
properties with one another but retain distinctive elements.
This results in a set of whistles that consist of subsets of related elements, which appears to be more easily remembered
and results in increased recall on the whole set.

Results

The experiment resulted in four chains of ten participants in
which each person produced an output set of twelve whistles
as the result of learning from the productions of the previous
person (or from the initial input set).

Figure 5: An example of recombination in chain four. One
whistle and the second part of another whistle are combined
in the next generation and the first part of this new whistle is
mirrored in a second version. The orange circles indicate an
effect that can be considered coarticulation.

Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7 show examples from several chains.
Figure 4 shows an example of the creation of a new whistle
through mirroring in chain one. Figure 5 shows an example
of recombination in chain four in which one whistle from the
previous generation is combined with the second part of another whistle to create a new whistle. In addition, the first
part of this new whistle is mirrored in a second new whistle.
Interestingly, these two whistles show an effect that can be
considered coarticulation, because the initial pitch of the second part is influenced by the final pitch of the first part. Figure
6 shows an example of repetition (analogous to reduplication)
in chain two in which a new whistle is formed by doubling an
existing whistle learned from the previous generation. Figure
7 shows combined mirroring, repetition and borrowing from
chain four, which results in a predictable system that is stable
and persists after its innovation.
The set of whistles produced by the tenth participant in a
chain is the end result of a process of repeated learning and

part of the tenth set of chain one. In this set we can clearly
identify a set of building blocks (slides up and down or single
notes) and these are reused and combined in different ways
in many whistles. Moreover, there appears to be ‘language’
specific constraints on the ways the elements are reused. In

this first chain for instance, single notes always follow each
other on the same pitch and slides always go down first, never
up-down. Such constraints exist in the other chains as well,
but are not the same. Another interesting observation is that
in the case of a silent pause, the signal mostly continues at the
same pitch, which could be considered a coarticulatory effect.
In summary: qualitatively we can see an increase in the
reuse of basic whistle elements in the sets. Once whistles that
are composed of these elements appear in the set, they are
more likely to be learned and recalled by later generations of
participants who use the similarities across whistles to group
them as subsets thus aiding their recall. This in turn makes it
less difficult to remember the whole set.

To measure whether the sets of whistles really become easier to learn, we computed the distance between the input set
and the output set for each participant in each chain to see
if the recall error is cumulatively lower for participants that
appear later in the chains. Recall error here is the sum of distances between each whistle in the output and its corresponding whistle from the input. To compute the distance between
a pair of whistles, we used the measure that was described
in the methods section. To compute the distance between
two sets of twelve whistles (two consecutive generations’ outputs), we used the following procedure: Each whistle in a set
was paired with a unique whistle from the second resulting in
a single set of 12 distinct pairs. Distance measures are computed for each pair and summed. This process was repeated
for all possible permutations of pairs. The lowest sum of distances (representing the best set of pairs across the two sets
of whistles) was chosen as the distance value for the two sets.

the way in which participants invent new whistles and from
the strategies the participants report to use themselves, we can
conclude that it is productively used as well.
Hockett (1960) proposed that a growth in meaning space
could be what makes combinatorial structure necessary.
However, the high functionality but lack of combinatorial
structure evident in ABSL shows that a language can have a
large meaning space (histories, dreams, legends and gossips
for instance are discussed effortlessly (Sandler et al., 2011))
without needing combinatorial signals. This suggests that
combinatorial structure is not necessarily the result of a growing meaning space.
The data we presented here also shows that combinatorial structure can emerge without a growing meaning space.
Hockett suggests that the signal space is first fully exploited
holistically until signals become too easily confused. Recombination is then needed to expand possibilities while maintaining discriminability. In our experiments combinatorial
structure emerges long before the signal space is fully exploited. Even in a system with a very small vocabulary of
only twelve signals structure emerges. Similar results have
been found in a related study using the visual modality (del
Giudice et al., 2010). This finding is therefore not slide whistle, or even modality, specific. What seems to be driving the
emergence of structure here relates to learnability. By developing from a holistic system (in which virtually everything
is possible within the limits of the modality) towards a discrete and combinatorial system (in which only a few elements
can be used and these elements can only be combined in restricted ways) the system becomes more predictable. Without structure, there are no constraints on which whistles are
well-formed. This makes the signal space theoretically unrestricted and unpredictable. On the other hand, combinatorial structure limits possibilities and allows learners to focus

Average nearest neighbor distance between whistles within set

Figure 9 shows the measured recall errors for all participants in all four chains. The recall error decreases towards the
end of the chain for most chains which means that the learnability of the sets increases. Using Page’s trend test (Page,
1963) we can see that there is indeed a significant cumulative
decrease of recall error (L = 1403, m = 4, n = 10, p < 0.001).
To test whether the reuse of basic elements increases and
the signals within a set increasingly share more features and
become similar in certain ways, we also compared whistles
within a set. In each generation, for all twelve whistles in
the set the distance to their nearest neighbor in the same set
was computed. The average of these distances was used as
the value that would indicate a higher reuse and sharing of
features in the case of a lower distance. We are aware of
the fact that a lower diversity of signals is not necessarily the
result of a higher reuse, but combined with the qualitative
analysis this seems very likely in our data and therefore we
use it as a suggestive measure.
Figure 10 shows a graph with these values for each chain
including the initial set. The graph shows indeed that the signals become more similar to each other and that, increasingly,
for most whistles in the set there is another one that is similar
in some way. Using Page’s trend test (Page, 1963) we can
show that there is a significant cumulative decrease in variation among the whistles (L = 1355, m = 4, n = 10, p < 0.01),
excluding the initial set.

Discussion
The work presented in this paper shows that effects of iterated
learning on an artificial sound system in the laboratory can
cause this system to become organized in a way that is reminiscent of how speech sounds and signs in sign languages
are organized. Superficial combinatorial structure has been
observed in the sound systems that emerge by analyzing the
results qualitatively. From the increase in learnability, from

only on the variations that are linguistically relevant. It has
been argued that languages are generally organized to be predictable and Smith and Wonnacott (2010) have shown that
the process of iterated learning can cause a linguistic system to lose unpredictable variation. Moreover, the principle of measuring predictability in a linguistic system has also
been applied to explain the existence and learnability of complex morphological systems in real languages (Ackerman,
Blevins, & Malouf, 2009).
In concert with an increase in predictability, the whistles
evolve towards sharing features. This makes it possible to
remember them as subsets, which makes learning and recall
easier. The idea that chunking of information in this way facilitates encoding more information in short-term memory is
well established (Miller, 1956). This strategy was often reported by our participants in a post-test questionnaire.
The whistles that fit the structure and conform to people’s
cognitive biases are more likely to be preserved from generation to generation in cultural evolution. Combinatorial structure therefore potentially emerges within a gradual (cultural)
evolutionary process. This provides an alternative explanation for the origins of combinatorial structure in addition to
the existing theory involving an increase in the number of
meanings to be expressed.
We hope to have demonstrated a fruitful new approach for
studying the influence of iterated learning and cognitive biases on the emergence of structure in speech. One simplification we made in the current design is that the whistles do
not convey meanings. The requirement of reproducing twelve
unique whistles provides an artificial pressure for expressivity, which would normally result naturally from the need to
express distinct meanings. In Kirby et al. (2008) an expressivity constraint was used effectively as well, although in that
case there was no absence of semantics. Our results involve
a first investigation of combinatorial structure while controlling for effects of semantics (e.g. iconicity, compositionality).
Our current work aims to build on the foundations laid by this
study by attaching meanings to the whistles.
