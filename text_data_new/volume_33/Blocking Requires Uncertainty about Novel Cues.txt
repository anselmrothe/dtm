Abstract
Blocking is a well-studied learning phenomenon in which
previous learning inhibits subsequent learning about novel cues.
Existing models provide different explanations for blocking and
predict different beliefs about novel cues early in the second
phase of blocking. Two experiments examined learners’ beliefs
when first encountering novel cues. The results suggest that the
introduction of the novel cue in the second phase of a blocking
paradigm adds uncertainty and that learners entertain the
possibility that novel cues are preventative.
A novel
computational account is proposed to explain people’s beliefs,
because existing models cannot fully account for these findings.

Blocking was first reported by Kamin (1969) and is one
of the most intensively studied phenomena in the field of
learning (Pineno & Miller, 2007). In a blocking paradigm,
participants first learn that the presence of a single cue event
(cue A) is always followed by a certain outcome (O).
Subsequently, cue A is paired with another, novel event (cue
X), and this pair is followed by the same outcome (O).
Despite the fact that cue X is always followed by the
outcome, learners do not learn to associate cue X with the
outcome. Learning about cue X is said to be blocked by the
previous experience with cue A.
Blocking was first observed in conditioning experiments
using non-human animals, and thus theories of conditioning
have been developed to explain this phenomenon.
According to one of the most famous proposals (Rescorla &
Wagner, 1972), learning only occurs when outcomes are
unexpected. The first phase of the blocking paradigm is
designed so that learners come to expect the outcome when
they encounter cue A. In the second phase, when cue A is
paired with the novel cue X, the Rescorla-Wagner model
suggests that learners will expect the same outcome that
followed cue A. Given that this is exactly what follows the
A-X pair, there is no surprise and thus no learning takes
place. Thus, Rescorla-Wagner predicts that nothing is
learned about the relationship between cue X and the
outcome because there is never an opportunity to do so.
Attentional accounts (Mackintosh, 1975a; Kruschke,
2001), on the other hand, argue that blocking occurs because
participants learn that cue X does not predict any change in
the outcome (beyond cue A itself) and thus come to ignore
cue X. Kruschke and Blair (2000) reported evidence

consistent with this proposal.
They first presented
participants with a traditional blocking procedure.
Subsequently, another novel cue was added to the A-X pair,
which was then followed by a novel outcome. Their results
showed that there was less learning about cue X even for the
new, novel outcome; a finding inconsistent with RescorlaWagner. Such results suggest that the blocking procedure
caused learners to ignore cue X, which subsequently
prevented learners from learning about the relationship
between cue X and the novel outcome. In addition,
Mackintosh (1975b) conducted a blocking study in which
rats first experienced a light repeatedly paired with a shock.
Later, the rats received a single trial on which light and tone
were presented together and followed by a shock. When
tested, the rats’ behavior indicated that they (weakly)
expected the shock to follow the tone presented by itself.
That is, the rats learned something about the novel cue after
receiving only a single compound A-X trial. This suggests
that, contrary to Rescorla-Wagner, learning in a blocking
paradigm proceeds normally, at least during the first trial of
the second phase, and that at least one compound trial may
be required before blocking occurs.
Although the blocking paradigm involves a sequence of
trial-by-trial presentations, previous studies have largely
focused on learners’ expectations at the end of the entire
blocking procedure (the Mackintosh, 1975b study is a rare
exception). Given that the prominent theories of blocking all
make predictions about the trial-by-trial dynamics that
underlie blocking, direct measurement of these dynamics
seems to be an efficient way to distinguish between the
competing theories.
In the present study, we investigate blocking by
focusing on participants’ beliefs about the novel cue X.
According to the Rescorla-Wagner model, participants’
expectations about the outcome the first time they encounter
the A-X pair should be identical to their expectations at the
end of the first phase when confronted with A alone. In
contrast, the attentional accounts predict that, participants
must gradually learn to ignore the novel cue X. Thus, the
first time participants observe the A-X pair, their
expectations about the outcome should be less certain than
their expectations about cue A alone.

Experiment 1A: The First Phase 2 Trial
Method

1697

Eight undergraduate students at Stony Brook University
participated for partial course credit and were instructed to
learn about how several medications were
re related to allergic
reactions. To do so, participants were provided with a set of
hypothetical medical records, each of which included
information about what medication the patient had taken
and whether the patient developed an allergic reaction
reaction.
Figure 1 illustrates an example of a trial in Experiment 1A.
The various medications were each represented by a
different color. The allergic reaction was represented by a
vertical thermometer-like bar that was either green and only
partially filled (to represent no allergic reaction)
reaction), or red and
more than half-filled (to represent allergic reaction
reaction).
Although the presence of an allergic reaction was always
represented as a half-filled
filled meter, participants were not
explicitly told whether there could be different degrees of
allergic reactions. This was done so ass to allow participants
to assume additivity (Beckers,
Beckers, De Houwer, Pineno, &
Miller, 2005).

Each participant completed two sequences, each of
which was identical except for the colors of the medications
used. After one sequence participants were asked to judge
medication
cation A and after the other they were asked to judge
the pair of medication A and X.. The order of the two
sequences was counterbalanced across participants. Before
starting, participants completed a brief sequence of 4
practice trials to familiarize them with the task.
Results
Participants’ judgments were converted from the original
scale into probabilities ranging from 0 to 1, where 0
represented the patient definitely not having an allergic
reaction and 1 representing the patient definitely having an
allergic reaction. The judged probability (shown in Figure
2) for the patient taking medications
medication A and X (M = .67, SD
= .21) was significantly lower than that for the patient
taking only medication A (M = .92, SD = .18, t(7) = 2.94, p
< .05). In addition, judgments for medication A (t(7) =
6.78, p < .001) and judgments for medication X (t(7) = 2.31,
p = .054) were greater than chance.

Figure 1. A example of a trial used in Experiment 1.
The trial sequence included two different types of trials
(see Table 1). Medication A was always followed by an
allergic reaction and medication Z was always followed by
the absence of an allergic reaction. Each type of trial was
repeated 8 times (randomly ordered). On each trial, the
medication was presented on the upper half of the screen for
2000 ms. The effect was then presented onn the bottom half
of the screen for 1000 ms.

At the end of the sequence, participants
articipants were presented
with a new patient that had either taken medication A or the
pair of medications, A and X. Participants
ticipants were asked to
judge how likely this new patient was to develop an allergic
reaction on a scale from 1 (definitely will not develop an
allergic reaction) to 8 (definitely will develop an allergic
reaction).

Discussion
The results from Experiment 1A suggest that participants
did not fully expect the allergic reaction to follow
medications A and X even though they had a strong
expectation that the effect would follow medication A by
itself. In fact, participants’ judgments
judgment about the AX pair
were surprisingly close to chance. This lack of certainty is
inconsistent with the predictions of the Recorla-Wagner
model, which suggests that learners’ expectations about the
outcome when confronted with medications A and X should
be identical to their expectations when confronted with
medication A alone. Our results suggest that participants
did not consider cue X to be redundant (as predicted by
Rescorla-Wager). Instead, the addition of a novel cue
appears to have added uncertainty to the outcome.

1698

In contrast, our participants’ behavior is quite consistent
with the predictions of the attentional accounts (e.g.,
Kruschke, Mackintosh). Because nothing is known about
the novel medication X, the attentional accounts assume that
attention directed to this cue can only hurt the accuracy of
learners’ predictions. This decrement in accuracy then leads
learners to ignore the novel cue on subsequent presentations
so that their expectations are eventually based almost
entirely on beliefs about medication A.

Experiment 1B: The Second Phase 2 Trial
Skeptics might argue that participants’ uncertainty in
Experiment 1A was due to task demands. Because
participants first encounter medication X at the same time
that they are asked to make the probability judgments, they
may have over-emphasized the lack of information about
medication X. For example, participants might have felt
self-conscious expressing absolute certainty in the face of
overtly novel information.
In Experiment 1B, participants again observed patients
taking medication A and developing allergic reactions.
Unlike Experiment 1A, however, participants in Experiment
1B then observed a single patient taking both medications A
and X and developing an allergic reaction. The purpose of
including this last patient taking both A and X was to
essentially give participants direct feedback about what
outcome would follow medications A and X as well as to
justify high degrees of confidence in AX probability
judgments.
In addition, this variation will allow us to
investigate whether one observation of AX is enough for
learners to fully expect the outcome.
In addition, Experiment 1B asked participants to make
probability judgments for a patient taking medication X
alone. This allowed us to test an additional prediction of the
attentional account. Specifically, these models (as well as
Rescorla-Wagner) assume that learners believe novel cues
to have a strength of zero (no influence). By eliciting
probability judgments of medication X alone, we can
investigate whether the uncertainty seen in Experiment 1A
is due to the novel cue having no influence.
Method
Twenty-one undergraduate students at Stony Brook
University participated for partial course credit. The same
stimuli and procedure from Experiment 1A were used. The
design was identical to Experiment 1A except for the
following changes. First, six different types of trials were
used (see Table 1). Second, there were 3 sequences of trials
(run separately in counter-balanced order): two consisting of
Phase 1 only (as in Experiment 1A), and the third including
an additional 4 trials from Phase 2 of a traditional blocking
design (see Table 1). In addition to one trial on which AX
was followed by the outcome, another pair of medications
(C and D) was followed by the allergic reaction and is the
control condition traditionally employed in a blocking
design (C and D were never presented alone). There were
also two pairs of medications (E and F, Y and Z negative
controls) followed by the absence of the allergic reaction to

control for the base rate of the presence of the allergic
reaction (at 50%). Without the negative controls,
participants might believe that the allergic reaction would
follow any medication. Each type of trial was only
presented once in Phase 2. 3) Following the two Phase-1only sequences, participants were asked to judge either
medication A or medication X. At the end of the Phase-2
sequence, participants were asked to judge the A-X pair of
medications.
Results
Participants’ judgments were again converted into
probabilities as in Experiment 1A. Participants again
judged the probability of an allergic reaction to be lower for
patients taking medications A and X (shown in Figure 2) (M
= .85, SD = .22) than for those patients taking medication A
alone (M = .95, SD = .10, t(20) = 2.41, p = .03). The judged
probability of an allergic reaction was also lower for
patients taking medication X alone (M = .58, SD = .21) than
for patients taking medication A alone (t(20) = 8.12, p <
.001) and for patients taking medications A and X (t(20) =
3.92, p < .001). Judgments for medication A and for the AX pair were significantly greater than chance (ps < .001),
whereas judgments for medication X were not (t(20) = 1.81,
p = .09).
Discussion
The results in Experiment 1B demonstrated that
participants did not expect the effect to follow the A-X pair
of medications as much as they expected the effect to follow
medication A alone even after observing the effect
following A-X. This finding is, again, inconsistent with
Rescorla-Wagner’s explanation of blocking, which suggests
that the effect should be fully expected at the beginning of
Phase 2. This also suggests that task demands are unlikely
to explain the results of Experiment 1A. These judgments
are consistent with the attentional accounts because the
certainty about the allergic reaction following medication A
was decreased by the novel medication X.
However, participants’ judgments about medication X
alone suggest that when encountering a novel cue,
participants expected the allergic reaction at approximately
chance levels. This finding is inconsistent with attentional
accounts which assume that novel cues have an initial
strength of zero. Cues with strengths of zero produce
outcomes 0% of the time whereas participants expected the
novel cue to produce the effect 58% of the time. Thus, we
are left with results that are decidedly inconsistent with
Rescorla-Wagner and not entirely consistent with the
attentional account. Here we put forth our own suggestion
in an attempt to reconcile these findings and make
additional, novel predictions.

A Bayesian Approach to Blocking
Our proposal relies on two important principles. First, we
assume that beliefs about influence are represented as
probability distributions, not point estimates. That is, each
potential strength value has some probability of being the
true value. This stands in sharp contrast to predominant

1699

psychological models (e.g., Rescorla-Wagner, Kruschke,
etc.). Second, following recent empirical work with both
human (Beckers et al., 2005) and non-human animals
(Beckers, Miller, De Houwer, & Urushihara, 2006), we
assume causal additivity. That is, learners expect that two
generative cues will jointly produce an effect that is greater
than that produced by either alone. Although in our
experiment there were only two levels for the effect
(reaction/no reacction), the allergic reaction representation
clearly implies a continuous outcome dimension required
for additivity.
We assume that cues can be fully described by their
influence, q (e.g., causal power, Cheng, 1997) which can
range from 1.0 (strongly generative) to -1.0 (strongly
preventative) with values of 0.0 indicating no influence. In
addition, we assume that the only influence on the allergic
reaction is exerted by the medications taken by that patient.
For simplicity, we only model the second phase of the
blocking paradigm here. Thus, we assume that medications
that were reliably paired with the allergic reaction during the
first phase (e.g., medication A) have maximal generative
influence (i.e., | =  = 1.0). In contrast, we assume
that learners are completely uncertain about the influence of
the novel medication introduced in the second phase.
Specifically, we represent uncertainty using the generic
priors described by Lu, et al. (2008):
  ∝ θe + 1 − θe
(1)
To exhibit a preference for sparseness (i.e., that causes are
unlikely to have weak influences), we set =4. In addition,
we assume that learners expect causes to be slightly more
likely to exert generative influences than preventative
influences (thus, θ is set to 0.65).
When asked to predict the probability of allergic reaction
in a patient taking the known medication A and the novel
medication X, we assume that cues combine their influence
in the manner of a noisy-OR gate (Glymour, 1998). Thus, if
medication X is generative (that is, if  >0),
|,  =  +  −  
(2)
If medication X is preventative (that is, if  <0),
|,  =  1 +  
(3)
Because the strength of medication X is uncertain, we
assume that participants’ probability judgments reflect the
following quantity:

|,  =  | ,   
(4)
The result of this computation is shown in Figure 2. Note
that the critical finding of Experiment 1A is mirrored in the
behavior of the model. The model suggests that the pair of
medications, A and X, is not guaranteed to produce an
allergic reaction even though medication A alone is. This is
because the uncertainty concerning the influence of
medication X leaves open the possibility that medication X
could prevent an allergic reaction that medication A alone
would otherwise produce. This possibility means that the
probability of the allergic reaction in the presence of
medications A and X should necessarily be lower than in the
presence of medication A alone.

In Experiment 1B, learners observed a single patient take
medications A and X and develop an allergic reaction.
Upon observing this patient, learners are assumed to update
their beliefs by employing Bayes rule (e.g.,  | =
  ∙ | ). When making this update, however, we
assume that learners believe that the allergic reaction that
has followed the pair of medications, A and X, is impossible
if each medication is exerting a generative influence (if they
did, a stronger reaction would be expected, Beckers et al.,
2005). That is, the allergic reaction observed in these
patients was produced by one of the two medications, but
not both (rather than Equation 2):
|,  =  1 −   +  1 −   (5)
Once this update is made, however, participants’
probability judgments are assumed to again be made
according to Equation 2-4. Figure 2 shows the simulated
results of Experiment 1B. Note that the model predicts less
than certain probability judgments even after observing the
pair of medications, A and B, followed by an allergic
reaction. Nonetheless, the judged probability increases in
light of this additional data.
This model can be contrasted with previous models of
blocking. For example, associative models assume that
novel cues have no influence (i.e., q=0). This is clearly
inconsistent with Experiment 1B. When making predictions
in the presence of a strong, generative cue (A) and a novel
cue (X), Rescorla-Wagner assumes that strengths sum (e.g.,
1+0). Thus, learners’ predictions should reflect absolute
certainty in the presence of the effect. The essential
problem with this is the false precision embodied in the
strength estimates attributed to novel cues. By endowing
these novel cues with a strength of zero, it is inconceivable
that these cues could be preventative. Under our account,
learners are not nearly this confident in their prior beliefs.
The critical innovation of our model is leaving open the
possibility that novel cues could be preventative. Indeed, if
the novel cue introduced in the second phase was
guaranteed to be generative, the model’s predictions would
be nearly indistinguishable from those of Rescorla-Wagner.
Thus, the model predictions illustrated in Figure 2 rely
strongly on learners’ prior beliefs about what sorts of
influences are permissible. Experiment 2 is designed to
provide a strong test of this prediction.

Experiment 2: The Influence of Prior Beliefs
In Experiment 1, learners were not certain that the allergic
reaction would follow the A-X medication pair, despite
strong expectations that the allergic reaction would follow
medication A on its own (Experiment 1A), and even after
observing a patient taking medications A and X and
developing a reaction (Experiment 1B). According to our
model, this is because people believe that X may either be
generative or preventative. For example, medications may
terminate the presence of symptoms (a preventative
influence), but may also produce side effects (a generative
influence).
According to our proposal, however,
minimizing the possibility of preventative influence should

1700

reduce the uncertainty observed in Experiment 1. To test
this prediction, Experiment 2 manipulated the plausibility of
preventative influence by using different sets of stimuli.
The Prevention-Possible condition used the same
medication stimuli used in Experiment 1 because
medications can either prevent or cause allergic reactions
(e.g., as a side effect). The Prevention-Unlikely condition
instead used food stimuli because food may cause allergic
reactions but it is much less likely that food can prevent
allergic reactions.
Method
Forty-two undergraduate students at Stony Brook
University participated for partial course credit and were
randomly assigned to one of the two conditions (PreventionPossible/Prevention-Unlikely), with 22 of them in the
Prevention-Possible condition. The stimuli in the
Prevention-Possible condition were identical to Experiment
1. In the Prevention-Unlikely condition, the medications
were replaced with pictures of food (e.g., mushrooms, eggs,
bread, cheese, and peanuts). The procedure and design were
identical to Experiment 1A.
Results
Participants’ judgments were again scaled to range
between 0 and 1, and these judgments are shown in Figure
3.
We conducted a 2 (condition: PreventionPossible/Prevention-Unlikely) by 2 (judgment: cue A/ cues
A and X) ANOVA with repeated measures on the latter
factor. This analysis yielded significant main effects of
judgment (F(1, 40) = 9.82, p <.01) and of condition (F(1,
40) = 245.87, p <.001). The interaction between condition
and judgment was also significant (F(1, 38) = 4.54, p <.05).
Participants in the Prevention-Possible condition judged the
effect to be less likely to follow cue A and X than
participants in the Prevention-Unlikely condition (t(20) =
2.97, p < .01). In contrast, the two groups did not differ on
their judgments of cue A alone (t(20) = .98, p = .34). In the
Prevention-Possible condition, the judged probability of the
effect following the A-X pair was lower than the probability
for cue A alone (t(21) = 2.99, p < .01). There was no such
difference in the Prevention-Unlikely condition (t(19) =
1.28, p = .22).
Discussion
Experiment 2 showed that the possibility of a novel cue
being preventative influenced participants’ probability
judgments. When novel cues could have a preventative
effect, pairing a known, generative cue (cue A) with a novel
cue (cue X) made it less probable that the outcome would
follow the pair of cues. Consistent with Experiment 1, this is
because participants allow for the possibility that the
outcome would be prevented by the novel cue. However,
when it was unlikely that novel cues could exert a
preventative influence, learners believed that the A-X pair
had to produce the same outcome because there was nothing
to counteract the influence of cue A.
In line with our model, the results in Experiment 2
suggest that part of the reason that participants were unsure
whether the effect would follow the A-X pair was that they

believed that the novel cue could potentially exert a
preventative influence.
When this possibility was
eliminated, learners’ uncertainty was also reduced. This is
also evidence that learners do not treat the novel cue X as
redundant, but instead attempt to infer the role of cue X as
best they can.

by our Bayesian account.

condition was simulated as described in the text. The
Prevention-Unlikely condition was simulated by modifying
Eq. 4 such that θ = .9.

General Discussion
Participants’ beliefs about novel cues in a traditional
blocking paradigm were evaluated in two experiments. In
Experiment 1, participants were asked to judge how likely
the outcome was to follow a novel cue (i.e., cue X) paired
with a known, generative cue (i.e., cue A). Participants
judged the outcome to be less likely to follow the
combination of cues than to follow the known generative
cue by itself. The results suggest that the novel cue
introduced uncertainty to participants’ expectations, which
is inconsistent with the predictions of the Rescorla-Wagner
model but consistent with attentional accounts of learning.
However, participants’ evaluations of the novel cue itself
were inconsistent with the attentional accounts. We
proposed a new, Bayesian account of blocking. Our model
is able to account for the results in Experiment 1 and
suggests that participants’ prior beliefs about novel cues,
particularly whether or not they may exert a preventative
influence, play a critical role in blocking. This prediction
was tested and confirmed in Experiment 2. We found that
participants in the Prevention-Possible condition judged the
pair of cues, A and X, to be less likely to produce the
outcome than cue A alone, suggesting that the novel cue X
added uncertainty to the situation. On the other hand,
participants in the Prevention-Unlikely condition judged the
pair of cue A and cue X to be just as likely to produce the
outcome as cue A alone, suggesting that cue X did not add
significant uncertainty.

1701

Our results suggest that novel cues introduce uncertainty.
Existing models assume that learners believe, with great
confidence, that novel cues have no influence at all,
ignoring potential uncertainty. Our model, on the other
hand, assumes that people’s beliefs about novel cues are
highly uncertain and can be represented as a probability
distribution over possible strength values. Such
consideration of uncertainty is crucial in explaining
participants’ judgments in the current studies and how
blocking is acquired. Moreover, uncertainty may help to
understand learning in general, not only blocking.
Several researchers (e.g., De Houwer & Beckers, 2003;
Lovibond, 2003) have argued that blocking may involve
controlled, inferential processes in addition to simpler,
associative processes. According to this account, learners
assume additivity: that if two cues each produce a certain
outcome, the pair of cues should produce a stronger
outcome than either does individually. Based on this
assumption, learners in a blocking procedure can infer that
cue X has no influence on the outcome because, if it did, the
outcome would have been greater than what cue A produced
by itself. Beckers, et al. (2005) investigated whether
additivity was critical to blocking by providing learners with
pretraining which demonstrated the additivity either held or
not before having participants complete a blocking
procedure. When additivity was violated, participants
showed weaker blocking than when additivity held,
arguably because the former could not reason using the
inferential procedure outlined above.
The model proposed here reflects the additivity
assumption (Eq. 5) and can thus account for such results.
Critically, the current model can do so without positing two
separate process (one associative and one inferential). By
assuming additivity, the current model gradually learns that
the novel cue, X, neither prevents nor produces the outcome.
If the additivity assumption did not hold, learners could only
rule out preventative influences; they would be left
uncertain as to whether the novel cue had strong or weak (or
no) influence, resulting in far less blocking.
Although our model is able to account for many prior
findings, there is data regarding other aspects of learning
that the model cannot explain. For example, our model
cannot immediately account for Kruschke and Blair’s
(2000) finding that subsequent learning about a blocked cue
is inhibited. Also, Kruschke, Kappenman, and Hetrick
(2005) utilized eye-tracking to demonstrate that participants
learned to literally ignore the blocked cue. So far, our
model does not predict anything about the acquisition of
attentional shift during learning. These datasets suggest
possible future directions for modification of the model
proposed here.
