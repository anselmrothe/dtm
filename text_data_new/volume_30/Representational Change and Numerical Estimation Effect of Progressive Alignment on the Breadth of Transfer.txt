ones on either side of a big one’. After children practice
making such comparisons, however, children's ability to
notice higher-order relational commonalities is facilitated.
For example, arrays like oOo and xXx might be described
with the relational terms, "baby, daddy, baby". In this way,
carrying out a concrete similarity comparison highlights the
relational structure common between the stimuli and makes
this relational structure more salient. When the relational
structure becomes more salient, the structure can be
abstracted and transferred to other related problems.
These findings on the effect of progressive alignment on
transfer suggests a mechanism for generally improving
children’s understanding of how numerical magnitudes are
related to one another. Like other stimuli, symbolic
numbers have both surface and relational similarities that
children can compare. For example, the symbols “1” and
“7” look more similar than do “1” and “3”, but within the
decimal system of numerical magnitudes, 1 and 3 are more
similar than 1 and 7. In our experiments, we sought to
capitalize on the surface similarities of numbers to draw
attention to the relational structure of the formal decimal
system, and thereby elicit application of this structure for
novel numeric ranges.

Abstract
The ability to carry out effortless structural alignment is a
hallmark of human cognitive processing. We tested whether
this mechanism might explain how humans learn to represent
the ratio characteristics of the decimal system. Specifically,
children were asked to align the familiar ratio structure of
object sets (e.g., how 10 is more similar to 1 than to 100 )
with the ratio structure of the decimal system (e.g., how 10 is
more similar to 1 than to 100) in an effort to change how
children represent the magnitudes of larger numbers, such as
those between 0-1,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000. Results
indicated that progressive alignment of high and low scales
led children to generalize linear representations of numerical
magnitude to the highest numbers tested, which otherwise
elicited the logarithmic pattern of estimates typical of
younger children, infants, and non-human animals.

Analogy and Representational Change
Analogy provides a potentially powerful mechanism for
representational change, allowing broad and rapid
generalization of novel information across multiple
contexts. This general perspective on representational
change, drawn from computational models of cognition and
cognitive development (Doumas, Hummel, & Sandhofer,
2008; Gentner, 1983; Hummel & Holyoak, 2003), artificial
grammar learning in infants (Marcus, Vijiyan, Bandi Rao,
& Vishton, 1999), and historical changes in scientific
concepts (Gentner et al., 1997; Holyoak & Thagard, 1995),
immediately suggests analogy as a candidate mechanism
for development of numerical representations. To test
whether analogy could serve this developmental function,
we examined whether progressive alignment—a means of
fostering analogies in young children (Kotovsky &
Gentner, 1996)—would lead numeric representations used
at low numerical ranges (0-100) to be spontaneously
generalized to progressively higher numerical ranges (01,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000).
Progressive alignment is a procedure that allows young
children to make similarity comparisons over concrete,
perceptual similarities in order to notice higher-order
relational commonalities (Kotovsky & Gentner, 1996). For
example, when shown stimulus arrays like oOo and xXx,
children might initially describe them as having ‘two little

Development of Numerical Representations
Across a wide range of tasks, children normally improve
their expectations about the magnitudes denoted by
symbolic numerals. For example, on a number line
estimation task, children are presented with a series of lines
flanked by a number (e.g., 0 and 1000), a third number
above the line (e.g., 230), and no other markings. When
asked to estimate the position of this third number,
children’s estimates of the positions of the numbers would
ideally increase linearly with the actual value of the third
number, thereby reflecting representation of the ratio
characteristics of the formal decimal system. In fact,
however, children’s estimates do not increase linearly—at
least not initially. On 0-1,000 number lines, sixth graders’
estimates increase linearly, but second graders’ estimates
increase logarithmically (Siegler & Opfer, 2003); on 0-100
number lines, second graders’ estimates increase linearly
(Geary, Hoard, Nugent, & Byrd-Craven, in press; Geary, et
al., 2007; Siegler & Booth, 2004; Siegler & Opfer, 2003),
whereas kindergartners’ estimates increase logarithmically

(Siegler & Booth, 2004); and on 0-10 problems,
kindergartners’ estimates increase linearly, whereas
preschoolers’ estimates increase logarithmically (Opfer &
Thompson, 2006). Finally, evidence for logarithmic-tolinear shifts is not unique to number lines. Parallel changes
have been found in estimation of real objects, money,
answers to arithmetic problems, measurements of novel
units, and the categorization and comparison of symbolic
numbers (Booth & Siegler, 2006; Laski & Siegler, 2007;
Opfer & Thompson, 2008; Thompson & Opfer, in press).
Theoretically, these initial expectations that numerical
magnitudes increase logarithmically are interesting because
they are consistent with Fechner’s Law, in which the
apparent magnitude of a quantity increases logarithmically
with actual value. This logarithmic representation of
numerical magnitude is apparently widespread across
species and age groups and is consistent with the
quantitative performance of time-pressured adults, young
preschoolers, human infants, and such non-human animals
as pigeons, rats, and monkeys (Brannon, 2005; Banks &
Hill, 1974; Feigenson, Dehaene, & Spelke, 2004; Moyer &
Landauer, 1967; Gallistel & Gelman, 1992; Roberts, 2005;
Xu & Spelke, 2000). In these groups, too, the difference
between 1 and 10 seems larger (or is more quickly
detected) than the difference between 101 and 110, much
as these numbers would be spaced on a logarithmic ruler.
Thus, it appears that the natural mental number line is
logarithmically scaled, whereas the decimal system that
children must eventually learn in school is linearly scaled
(Dehaene, Dehaene-Lambert, & Cohen, 1998).
How does the logarithmic-to-linear shift in numeric
representations take place with increasing age or
experience? An important mechanism implicated in
previous work on number line estimation (Opfer & Siegler,
2007; Opfer & Thompson, 2008) is children’s use of
analogy to structure their generalization of “log discrepant”
information. According to this view, children normally
encounter information that does not match their logarithmic
representation of numerical magnitudes (e.g., hearing 150
referring to a relatively small part of 1,000 items). If
children already apply linear representations in some
numerical contexts (e.g., for small numeric ranges), such
experiences of log discrepancy may lead them to draw
analogies between the two contexts and to extend the linear
representation to numerical ranges where they previously
used logarithmic representations. For example, if a second
grader is shown that her estimate of the position of 150 on a
0-1,000 number line is too high, and also is shown the
correct position of 150 within that range, she may draw the
analogy “150 is to the 0-1,000 range as 15 is to the 0-100
range.” This analogy may lead her to rely on a linear
representation for the 0-1,000 range on subsequent
estimation problems. Consistent with this account of an
analogy being drawn at the level of the entire
representation (as opposed to being restricted to numbers
near the point of feedback), several studies (Opfer &
Siegler, 2007; Opfer & Thompson, 2008; Thompson &
Opfer, in press) have found that log discrepant information

The Present Study
The present study addressed two novel questions about
such broad and rapid changes: (1) How widely can children
generalize linear representations of numerical magnitudes?
and (2) Is analogy a mechanism of representational change
that is sufficient to produce generalization to larger
numerical contexts? These two questions are important for
identifying the mechanism of logarithmic-to-linear shifts,
and previous work has not addressed these two questions
directly.
To directly test whether analogy could serve as a
mechanism for representational change in the numeric
domain, we brought number lines for high scales (0-1,000,
0-10,000, and 0-100,000) into progressive alignment with
scales that children already represent linearly (0-100). The
alignment procedure was “progressive” in two senses. First,
all children’s comparisons, regardless of the experimental
condition to which they were assigned, were supported by
increasing the perceptual similarity of low and high scales.
Specifically, by having the color of units appearing on 0100 scales (pears, cherries, and carrots) matching the color
of zeros denoting order of magnitude on 0-1,000, 0-10,000,
and 0-100,000 scales, we used color information to
highlight the similarity between 0-100 and 0-1,000 scales,
0-100 and 0-10,000 scales, and 0-100 and 0-100,000 scales
(see Figure 1). Second, in the alignment condition,
children’s comparisons of low to high scales were
supported by allowing children to directly compare 0-100
problems with 0-1,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000 problems;
in contrast, children in the no alignment condition were not
given this opportunity. Thus, all participants received the
benefit of overlapping perceptual similarity across the low
and high scales, but the underlying structural relation
between the low and high scales was made more salient in
the alignment condition than the no alignment condition by
allowing children to compare scales directly. Finally, to test
for representational change, we examined numerical
estimates on a 0-1,000 post-test, where children were given
no feedback, no perceptual support, and no opportunity to
compare problems to lower scales.

Method
Participants
Participants were 30 second graders (mean age = 7.75, SD
= .46; 13 girls, 17 boys) enrolled in public elementary
schools in the midwestern United States.

Design and Procedure
Children estimated the placement of numbers on number
lines over three phases of the experiment: training,
generalization and posttest (Figure 1). The number line task
presented children with a line flanked by two hatch marks,

670

the left hatch mark labeled “0,” and the right hatch mark
labeled with either “100,” “1000,” “10000,” or “100000.”
On each trial, children were asked to estimate the position
of a number (one per number line) by making a hatch mark
through the line. The numbers to be estimated (2, 5, 8, 11,
15, 25, 49, 61, 73, 94, and multiples thereof) were chosen
to reduce the influence of specific knowledge (e.g., that 50
is half of 100) and to over-sample at the low end of the
range to maximize the discriminability of the logarithmic
and linear functions.
To test the effect of progressive alignment on transfer
from training to generalization and posttest problems,
participants were randomly assigned to one of two
experimental conditions in this between-subjects design: no
alignment (N = 14) and alignment (N = 16) (cf. Figure 1a
and 1b). In the no alignment condition, participants
received training and generalization problems one at a time;
thus, participants could not directly compare new problems
to old problems. In the alignment condition, participants
received identical training problems, but generalization
problems were presented alongside previously solved
training problems, thereby allowing children in the
alignment group to compare generalization problems to
training problems (i.e., to compare units to orders of
magnitude). Thus, in both conditions, children were told
that generalization problems were “just like” the training
problems, but only the alignment condition allowed
perceptual comparison of training and generalization
problems.
In the training phase (Figure 1, left column), participants
were given 40 0-100 number line problems, and they
received feedback on their estimates (for feedback
procedure, see Opfer & Siegler, 2007). All training
problems specified units (i.e., pears, cherries, and carrots),
and after completing these problems, children were shown
that their estimates did not differ much over different units.
In the generalization phase (Figure 1, middle column), we
highlighted similarity of generalization and training
problems (color of units matched color of zeros denoting
order of magnitude) by asking participants “to try some
more problems just like the ones you just finished.” Then,
participants were asked to make estimates for 40 new
number lines (0-100, 0-1,000, 0-10,000) without feedback.
In the posttest phase (Figure 1, right column), participants
were asked to estimate the position of 10 numbers on 01,000 number lines without receiving feedback and without
perceptual support.

condition, and b) Alignment condition. Pears = green;
cherries = red; carrots = orange.

Training
Based on previous studies (Booth & Siegler, 2006;
Geary, et al., 2007; Laski & Siegler, 2007; Siegler &
Booth, 2004; Siegler & Opfer, 2003), we had expected that
second graders’ estimates in the 0-100 range would be
highly accurate, due to their use of a linear representation
for familiar numbers, regardless of either the specific units
tested or experimental condition. To test this hypothesis,
we first examined accuracy of numerical estimates across
the training phase.
Accuracy was measured by first converting the
magnitude estimate for each number (the child’s hatch
mark) to a numeric value (the linear distance from the “0”
mark to the child’s hatch mark), then dividing the result by
the total length of the line. The magnitude of each child’s
error was calculated by taking the mean absolute difference
between each of the child’s estimated values and the actual
values.
As expected, accuracy did not vary over units or
experimental condition (Fs < 1), with participants’
accuracy hovering at ceiling levels for the no alignment
(MBlank = 91%, MPear = 93%, MCherry = 93%, MCarrot = 92%)
and alignment condition (MBlank = 88%, MPear = 95%,
MCherry = 94%, MCarrot = 94%). To examine whether this
high accuracy was the result of children relying on linear
representations of numerical magnitude, estimates were
next regressed against actual values using the logarithmic
and linear regression functions. Again, participants in the
alignment condition produced more linear than logarithmic
series of estimates (Blank R2 = .87; Pear R2 = .998; Cherry
R2 = .996; Carrot R2 = .996) as did participants in the no
alignment condition (Blank R2 = .99; Pear R2 = .993;

Results
The performance of children in the alignment and no
alignment groups was compared over all three experimental
phases: training, generalization, and posttest.

671

Cherry R2 = .996; Carrot R2 = .995). Thus, no differences
among groups existed prior to the generalization phase.

Generalization
We next examined the effect of alignment on
generalization. To do so, we first compared accuracy of
estimates generated by the alignment group to the no
alignment group across the four orders of magnitude (see
Figure 2) by conducting a 2 (condition: alignment, no
alignment) x 4 (scale: 0-100, 0-1,000, 0-10,000, 0-100,000)
repeated measures ANOVA on accuracy scores. There was
a main effect of scale, F(3, 26) = 21.06, p < .0001, and
condition, F(1, 28) = 13.65, p < .0001, and these main
effects were qualified by a significant condition x scale
interaction, F(3, 26) = 5.15, p < .01.

Figure 3: Linear and logarithmic model fits on
generalization problems.
As previously, the linear function was the best-fitting
function for both experimental conditions on the 0-100
generalization problems (alignment, R2 = .99; no
alignment, R2 = .996). The experimental groups differed,
however, in whether the best-fitting function for their
median estimates across the other generalization problems
(0-1,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000) was the logarithmic or
the linear function. For the no alignment group, the best
fitting function was the logarithmic one across the 0-1,000
and 0-10,000 generalization problems (log R2 = .90 and
.85, respectively). On the 0-100,000 generalization
problems, both the linear (R2 = .46) and logarithmic
function (R2 = .39) provided a poor fit of the children’s
estimates in the no alignment condition. Across the 01,000, 0-10,000, 0-100,000 generalization problems, the
alignment group generated estimated best fit by the linear
function (lin R2 = .997, .98, and .97, respectively). Thus,
results indicated that the alignment group successfully
generalized the learned linear representation to larger
orders of magnitude, whereas the no alignment group failed
to generalize their learning.
In summary, these findings indicate that alignment
caused children to generalize linear representations
broadly, across 0-1,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000 problems,
whereas simply providing children feedback in the 0-100
range and highlighting the similarity between units and
orders of magnitude was insufficient for children to “scale
up” their learned linear representation to successively larger
numerical magnitudes.

Figure 2: Accuracy across generalization problems.
Post-hoc t-tests indicated that the effect of alignment was
tied to the magnitude of the scale, with larger effects for
larger numbers. Thus, there was no effect of alignment for
0-100 number line problems, t(28) = .83, p > .05, ns,
presumably because participants already possessed a linear
representation on these numbers. In contrast, alignment
significantly improved accuracy for 0-1,000 problems (no
alignment, M = 78%, alignment; M = 90%), t(28) = 3.47, p
< .01; for 0-10,000 problems (no alignment, M = 63%;
alignment, M = 83%), t(28) = 2.61, p = .01; and 0-100,000
problems (alignment, M = 63%; no alignment, M = 85%),
t(28) = 4.06, p < .001.
To test whether these improvements in accuracy came
from children substituting a linear representation of number
for a logarithmic one, we compared the fit of the best fitting
linear and logarithmic functions to the median numerical
estimates across both experimental conditions in the
generalization phase (see Figure 3).

Posttest
To examine whether alignment caused the representational
change implied by performance on the generalization
problems, we tested numerical estimation on a post-test
where we eliminated perceptual support (i.e., no
fruit/vegetable icons or colored zeros). If children grasped
the analogy implied by the progressive alignment, we

cognitive changes take place, as well as the conditions
under which cognitive development is slow and gradual.
Currently, these two types of cognitive changes figure
strongly in competing theories of cognitive development,
but the theory of representational change depicted here
points to a way of reconciling them within an architecture
that is capable of relational reasoning (e.g., Doumas,
Hummel, & Sandhofer, 2008; Gentner, 1983; Hummel &
Holyoak, 2003). Finally, by showing that progressive
alignment leads young children to adopt a linear
representation of number and abandon a logarithmic one, it
seems that the methodology used in this experiment could
be a simple classroom intervention. Given previous
evidence of causal and correlational links between
numerical estimation and other mathematical skills (Booth
& Siegler, 2006, in press), we believe this intervention is
likely to be effective too.

reasoned, their estimates on the number line should
continue to increase linearly, even when perceptual support
was lacking.
As illustrated in Figure 4, participants’ estimates in the
alignment group were indeed better fit by the linear
function (R2 = .95) than by the logarithmic function (R2 =
.76), whereas the estimates of the no alignment group were
better fit by the logarithmic function (R2 = .91) than by the
linear (R2 = .66). Thus, not only were the alignment
group’s estimates best fit by the linear function across all
generalization problems, this trend continued at posttest,
indicating that progressive alignment provided the most
supportive condition for participants to “scale up” the linear
representation to larger numerical contexts.

General Discussion
The ability to carry out effortless structural alignment is a
hallmark of human cognitive processing (Gentner &
Markman, 1997). In this experiment, children were asked
to align the familiar ratio structure of units (e.g., how 10
is more similar to 1 than to 100 ) with the ratio structure
of the decimal system (e.g., how 10 is more similar to 1
than to 100) in an effort to change how children represent
the magnitudes of larger numbers, such as those between 01,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000. Results supported the
assumption that progressive alignment was necessary to
generalize a linear representation of 0-100 to higher
numbers. Specifically, although we found that feedback on
0-100 problems caused all children to generate linear
estimates on 0-100 “training problems,” only children in
the alignment condition generalized their linear
representation to 0-1,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000
“generalization problems,” and only children in the
alignment group continued to generate linear estimates on
problems without perceptual support, alignment, and
feedback (“post-test”).
These results are important for three reasons. First, these
results provide the first behavioral evidence that a known
cognitive mechanism—analogy—allows a pre-existing
numerical representation to be extended to represent the
magnitudes of a potentially infinite range of new numbers.
Second, results are important developmentally because they
indicate both the conditions under which broad and abrupt
