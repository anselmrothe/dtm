left item (Spencer & Hund, 2003). And this “pull” should
vary non-linearly with the separation between the left and
right targets with a strong pull when the items are close
(which should help reduce geometric biases), a weaker pull
when they are farther (which should increase geometric
biases), and no pull when they are very far (which should
reduce geometric bias since the left item can accumulate
traces that are isolated from other influences).
We tested these competing predictions, holding the
position of a left target constant and varying the placement
of a right target across conditions. Recall responses showed
a significant non-linear effect on performance to the left
target, even though the spatial position of this target, the
memory delays, and the number of trials were identical
across all conditions. Thus, targets in a right category affect
targets in a left category in the non-linear manner predicted
by the DFT. We see no way the CA model can account for
these findings without recourse to two categorical
representations (thereby rendering this model unfalsifiable).

Two Competing Theories of Spatial Memory
When people are asked to recall the location of a target after
short delays, responses are biased away from cardinal axes.
Such “geometric” biases increase systematically over delays
(Spencer & Hund, 2002). According to the Category
Adjustment (CA) model (Huttenlocher, Hedges, & Duncan,
1991), these responses reflect bias toward category
prototypes located at the centers of spatial regions.
Recently, we have proposed an alternative account using
the Dynamic Field Theory (Spencer, Simmering, Schutte, &
Schöner, 2007). According to the DFT, geometric biases
reflect a type of contrast effect as people try to (1) hold the
target location actively in working memory, and (2) remain
anchored to perceived reference frames (e.g., cardinal axes).
Geometric biases arise because memory is repelled from
perceived reference frames (Simmering, Schutte, &
Spencer, in press; Simmering, Spencer, & Schöner, 2006).

Here, we focus on two differences between these theories:
(1) The CA model has no mechanism for accumulating
trial-to-trial experience. By contrast, the DFT uses a
form of Hebbian learning where long-term memory
(LTM) traces accumulate at sites associated with
locations held in working memory on previous trials.
(2) The CA model is hierarchical in nature with finegrained encoding at one level and categorical encoding
at another level. The DFT, by contrast, integrates all
available information (though only some information
might affect performance due to metric details).
These differences can be set in opposition as follows.
According to the CA model, targets are first encoded and
categorized. Thus, when presented with a target to the left of
a category boundary, people will encode the target and its
category membership. From that point on, information in
the adjacent category (the right category) should have no
influence on performance. Thus, if people responded to a
right target on previous trials, such responses should have
no bearing on recall of the left target. Note that if the CA
model is modified to allow multiple categories to be used at
recall, the model becomes unfalsifiable (Baud-Bovy, 2008).
By contrast, the DFT predicts that items responded to in
the right category on previous trials can have an impact on
memory for a target in the left category. This occurs through
the model’s LTM mechanism: the LTM of targets to the
right should exert an attractive “pull” on the memory of the
