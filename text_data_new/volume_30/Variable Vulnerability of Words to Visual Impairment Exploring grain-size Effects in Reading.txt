& Goswami, 2005), grain sizes that are language specific
and allow for an efficient mapping between the two levels
or representation. In this view the ability to identify and
make optimal use of orthographic clusters in reading plays a
major role in defining the ability to read.
One high-order cluster that has received particular
attention in recent years as a potentially important grain size
in reading is the grapheme. A grapheme is defined as a
written representation of a phoneme (Berndt, Reggia, &
Mitchum, 1987). For example, the word BREAD contains
the five letters B, R, E, A, D, that map onto the four
phonemes in /bred/. Therefore, four graphemes can be
identified: B, R, EA, D, in virtue of the mapping between
the letters and the phonemes. Graphemes therefore provide a
direct mapping between orthography and phonology, and
this mapping depends on the grain size of the orthographic
representation.
Two main studies suggested explicitly that graphemes
might act as perceptual units in reading. Rey, Jacobs,
Schmidt-Weigand and Ziegler (1998), found that word
identification times were longer for low frequency words
composed of few graphemes (i.e. /biJ/ as in BEACH) than
for control words composed of many graphemes (i.e. /krIsp/
as in CRISP), but critically having the same number of
letters. This graphemic effect slowed processing time due to
the extra-cost of having to functionally group more than one
letter into a single grapheme. The study thus offered
empirical evidence of a “phonemic” effect in orthographic
processing.
A second study conducted by Rey, Ziegler and Jacobs
(2000) implemented a letter detection paradigm to explore
graphemic effects in reading. They asked participants to
detect a single letter in words where the target letter was
embedded in a multi-letter grapheme (i.e. ‘A’ in ‘BEACH’)
or when it corresponded to a single-letter grapheme (i.e. ‘A’
in ‘PLACE’). Participants were slower in detecting the
target in the former case than in the latter, suggesting that
graphemes are processed as perceptual units in reading. This
effect was found irrespective of the word frequency or
phonemic similarity, and held for both English and French
native speakers. The authors claim that the effect emerges
from the difficulty in splitting the unit (grapheme) into its
constituent letters in order to perform the task. However,
neither of these studies directly tested participants on a
reading task, and the claim that graphemes are “perceptual

Abstract
Languages vary in the grain size used to map orthography
onto phonology, but the use of different grain sizes varies also
within a language. A core question is what kind of
information the reading system is using to map orthography
onto phonology. A unit that has received particular attention
in recent years is the grapheme. Graphemes are defined as
written representations of phonemes, and they can be
composed of multiple letters. If graphemes are functional
reading units, then a word containing a multi-letter grapheme
(digraph) should be read more accurately than a word without,
given the same kind of perceptual noise to impair the
orthographic input. We trained a neural network model to
map English orthography onto phonology. Impairing the
model revealed a distinction in performance with words with
digraphs less affected by damage than control words. A
behavioral experiment confirmed the prediction of the model.
We discuss these results in light of a psycholinguistic grain
size theory of reading.
Keywords: grain size; reading; modeling

Introduction
The question of how we recognize words is one of the
core issues in cognitive psychology, and has been
investigated at length (for a review see Prinzmetal, 1995).
There are two possibilities for how written words may be
identified: whole word recognition (or holistic recognition)
approaches and recognition by parts approaches. In the
former approach, a word is hypothesized to be recognized as
a single object, as suggested by word-superiority effects in
reading (Wheeler, 1970). The latter approach has instead
tried to identify smaller grain sizes as important for word
recognition such that some combinations of letters and their
features (Rastle & Coltheart, 1998; Martelli, Majaj, & Pelli,
2005), orthographic syllables (Carreiras, Alvarez, & De
Vega, 1993), and/or onsets and rimes (Bowey, 1990) are the
functional units of the reading system. The debate has
sparked great interest especially for its developmental and
pedagogical implications (Ziegler & Goswami, 2005;
Stanovich & Stanovich, 1995).
A main theoretical framework has been recently proposed
which assumes that learning to read is learning to find
shared grain sizes in orthography and in phonology (Ziegler

reading” units remains inferential, with only indirect
evidence supporting it. If graphemes are single perceptual
reading units, then one prediction should follow: words
containing multi-letter graphemes should be more resistant
to impairment to the visual input and should be recognized
more accurately than words without such graphemes. This
should not be the case for single letters not part of multiletters graphemes, that entail a highly componential
mapping between orthography and phonology. Single-letter
graphemes entail highly componential mappings (one-toone), while multi-letter graphemes entail less componential
ones (two-to-one) (see Figure 1).
The degree of componentiality in the mapping should
therefore predict how well a particular grain size can be
perceived.
Moreover, if the reading system develops sensitivity
during the course of reading acquisition to letter clusters that
functionally map onto one phoneme, then a neural network
that employs single letters as input and single phonemes as
output should develop the same sensitivity to words with
graphemes, and show less vulnerability for words
containing multi-letter graphemes in case of damage at the
input level.
One way to explore this sensitivity to grain sizes is given
by the possibility of impairing a standard model of reading
and look at the level of accuracy with which different grain
sizes are reproduced.
The scope of the present study is twofold. In the first part
we look at whether a simple neural network with no explicit
graphemic level of representation trained on a large corpus
of English words could discover the existence of graphemes
as an appropriate grain size for English. We tested the
model specifically on a set of words containing multi-letter
graphemes (digraphs) and a set of control words, both with
and without impairment to the model’s input. In the second
part we confirm with a behavioral investigation the same
prediction that words containing multi-letter graphemes are
more resistant to visual noise than control words, testing
healthy participant with degraded stimuli.

grain sizes. Dual Route Cascade models (DRC; Coltheart,
Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001; Perry, Ziegler,
Zorzi, 2007) have explicitly implemented a level of
representation for the graphemes as model’s input, instead
of using single letters. Classic parallel distributed processing
(PDP) models of reading have avoided implementing such
levels of representation (Harm & Seidenberg, 1999; Harm &
Seidenberg, 2004; Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg &
Patterson, 1996). This latter class of models generally use
single letters as input and assume that information about the
appropriate grain size would be discovered during the
course of learning to map orthography onto phonology. This
ability has been shown in the simulation of graded
consistency effects that the DRC fails to account for (Zevin
& Seidenberg, 2006). A PDP model then should show
sensitivity to variations in grain sizes within a language.
Following we describe an attempt to explore this sensitivity
by impairing a standard model of reading.

Method
Architecture
The model is shown in Figure 2, and is based closely on
Harm and Seidenberg’s (1999) connectionist model of
reading. The network comprised of an orthographic layer
with 206 units, a hidden layer with 100 units, and a
phonological layer with 88 units. The orthographic units
were fully connected to the hidden units, which in turn were
fully connected to the phonological output units. A set of 35
cleanup units mediated the computation from the phoneme
representation to itself (as in Harm & Seidenberg, 1999).
The phonological units were self-connected with each other.
The direct connections between phonological units allowed
the encoding of simple types of dependencies between
phonological features (the fact for example that a phoneme
cannot be both consonantal and sonorant; Harm &
Seidenberg, 1999). The orthographic representations for
words were slot based, a in Harm and Seidenberg (1999)
with one of 26 units active in each slot for each letter. There
were 8 letter slots. Words were inputted to the model with
the first vowel of the word in the fourth letter slot. At the
output layer, there were 8 phoneme slots for each word,
three representing the onset, two for the nucleus, and three

(as in chair), and TH (as in thorn). All these three digraphs
map respectively onto one phomene slot in the output as
affricates were represented as a single set of phonological
features in the output.
The control words were matched with the experimental
ones for: same initial letter, same number of letters, similar
bigram frequency for the first two bigrams, and word
frequency. The control words for SH digraph words all
began with ST, for CH, the control words began with CR,
and for the TH words, control words began TR. The stimuli
were also matched for likelihood of guessing the word using
a procedure to estimate predictability of words from partial
views (see Figure 3). For each letter in the word we
estimated the likelihood of correctly reading the word if that
letter was the leftmost letter processed (and all rightward
letters were processed correctly). The estimate was derived
by dividing the lexical frequency of the target word by the
summed lexical frequency of all words between 3 and 9
letters in length that would be consistent with that partial
template of the word.

for the coda of each word. So, the word “help” was inputted
as “- - h e l p - -”, where “-” indicates an empty slot.

This kind of representation has the advantage of capturing
the fact that different phonemes in different positions
sometimes differ phonetically (Harm & Seidenberg, 1999),
though similarities between onset and coda phonemes were
not directly available to the model. Each phoneme was
represented in terms of 11 phonological features, as
employed by Harm and Seidenberg (1999). The units in the
model were standard sigmoidal units with real-valued output
ranging between 0 and 1 for the input and hidden layer, and
–1 and 1 for the output layer.

Input Impairment
In order to impair the visual input to the model across the
critical letters, we reduced the activation from input letter
slots along a monotonic gradient from left to right, such that
the largest reduction in activation was from the leftmost
letter slots. We used two severities of impairment. A severe
impairment was implemented by reducing the weights of the
connections to the leftmost (first) letter slot by 75%, the
connections to the second letter slot by 64%, reduction of
53% to the third letter slot, and so on across the input units.
Hence, the gradient was linear, and ended with a 0%
reduction of connections to the rightmost unit. A mild
impairment reduced connections from the first letter slot by
50%, the second slot was reduced by 43%, the third slot by
36%, and so on, to zero reduction for the rightmost letter
slot. Both words with digraphs and their control occupied
the same number of slots at the input, starting from the same
leftmost slot which contained the first letter. This type of
impairment procedure ensured that the beginning of the
word (the first leftmost letter slots, which were occupied by
digraphs and control digrams in our experimental material)
was most affected by the impairment to the input.

Training and testing
7291 monosyllabic words were chosen from the CELEX
database (Baayen, Pipenbrock, & Gulikers, 1995) and were
used as the training corpus. We selected words with
frequency greater than 68 per million in the database. Each
word was 1 to 8 letters long and was assigned a frequency
derived from its frequency of representation in the original
database and log transformed (see Plaut et al., 1996, for a
discussion of log frequency compression). Words with more
than three phonemes in the coda were omitted from the
input set. The model was trained using the backpropagation
learning algorithm (Rumelhart, 1986), with the weight of
the connections initialized to random values with mean 0,
variance 0.5, and learning rate µ=0.001.
Words were selected randomly according to their
frequency. We stopped training after ten million words had
been presented. For testing, we assessed the model’s
performance for a reading task on all words in the training
set.
The model’s production for each phoneme slot at the
output was compared to all the possible phonemes in the
training set, and to the empty phoneme slot (where values of
all units in the slot were –1). For word presentations, if the
model’s performance in each phoneme slot was closer to the
target than to any other phoneme, then the model was
judged to have read the word correctly.
The model was specifically tested on two sets of 62 words
each. One set contained words with digraphs in the initial
position and one did not. All the stimuli were monosyllabic,
5 letters long and occurred in the training set.
Three types of digraphs were identified, with the
constraint of being in initial position: SH (as in shame), CH

Results
After it had been trained on 10 million patterns, the model
correctly reproduced 93.6% of the words in the corpus,
which falls slightly short of the performance achieved by the
Harm and Seidenberg (1999) model of reading (98%
correct). Before impairment, the model was 100% correct
at reading both experimental stimuli and control words. The
model with the severe input impairment made errors on
reading 83.5% of the words. Of these, 75% of the wordreading errors affected only the first and/or second
phonemes. Two types of errors were measured: omission of
the first and/or second phoneme and substitutions of the first
and/or second phoneme, or a combination of the two. The
mild impairment model made errors on 56.3% of the words.

Method

Errors on the first 2 phonemes accounted for 66.2% of the
errors. The impairment procedure implemented at the input
level was thus successful in selectively impairing the output
at its leftmost side.
The model was then assessed on levels of accuracy for the
set of experimental words and their controls. Both the
severe and mild impairment model showed sensitivity to the
presence of digraphs in a word: words with digraphs were
reproduced more correctly than words without (χ2 (1) =
11.896, p<.01 ).
The same sensitivity was again shown by the mild
impairment model (χ2 (1) = 19.701, p<.01) (see Figure 4).
Together, both models showed a relative robustness to
impairment for words containing digraphs when compared
to control words with no digraphs.

Participants. Fifteen university students, all native English
speakers, participated in the experiment. All had normal or
corrected to normal vision.
Materials. The same sets of words used in the simulation
were used in the behavioral study. In addition to the
experimental stimuli and control words 84 fillers were
selected, all five letters long. These fillers had different
initial bigrams and different initial letters to the
experimental and control stimuli.
Words were presented centered in a frame with the
addition of random 2-dimensional digital pixel noise applied
according to a gradient from left to right, left being the most
affected by digital noise (example is shown in Figure 5), in
order to instantiate a similar degraded impairment to the
visual information as employed in the simulation work. This
procedure made the initial letters difficult to perceive,
leaving the rightmost letters almost unaffected. The same
gradient and amplitude of digital noise was applied to all the
stimuli.
The experimental session consisted of 3 blocks. The first
two blocks contained 20 experimental stimuli with digraphs,
20 control stimuli without digraphs, and 28 fillers, and the
third block contained the remaining 22 experimental stimuli,
22 control words, and 28 fillers. The order of the blocks was
randomised across participants, as were the stimuli in each
block.

Discussion
The simulation presented above confirmed our prediction
that a neural network trained to map letters onto phonemes
performs better with words containing digraphs (or multiletter graphemes) than with control words which do not
contain digraphs, when there is impairment to the model’s
input. The model does so as a consequence of the fact that
the two letters embedded in the digraphs map onto a single
phoneme, and although both letters are damaged, the
combined residual activation of the two letters is still
enough to activate the right phoneme at the output level and
preserve the whole word.
The model does not have any explicit level of
representation for the graphemes, but employs only single
letter slots at the input (orthographic) level. The graphemic
effect shown here is therefore a consequence of the initial
phoneme in the digraph words receiving partial information
from more than one letter position, whereas the control
words required a one-to-one mapping from letter slots to
phoneme slots. In the next study, we tested whether the
model’s demonstration of different grain-size effects
for words containing digraphs was evident in a
behavioral study, when visual representation of the word
was impaired for participants reading words.

Procedure. Participants were asked to read aloud the
stimuli. They were informed that all the stimuli were real
words and that they should report whatever they could read.
Participants saw a fixation cross at the center of a computer
screen for 1000-ms, followed by the word in a frame with
the added pixel noise for 250-ms. The stimuli were then
followed by a mask for 500-ms. An interstimulus interval of
2000-ms preceded the presentation of the next fixation
cross. Responses were recorded and subsequently
transcribed by the experimenter. Participants were seated
approximately 25cm from the screen, and stimuli were
presented centered as heavy gray text (Courier New 150)
on a gray scale background (300 by 100 px) in order to

words determined the type of processing that occurs in the
reading system. For shallow orthographies, such as Italian
or Spanish, where the majority of letter-phoneme mappings
are one-to-one, the grain size developed during reading is
small. For languages where the context of individual letters
has to be taken into account to pronounce them, then the
grain size grows according to the size of the context
required. English has instances both of componential, oneto-one mappings between letters and phonemes, and also
occasions where sets of letters (digraphs, or trigraphs) map
onto single phonemes. Consequently, we investigated
whether, within a language, the grain size for processing
was sensitive to the local characteristics of the word in
terms of componentiality.
The model of reading suggested that the computational
properties of the mapping between letters and phonemes
was differentially vulnerable to variations in the mapping
within individual words. Though the difference between
words with digraphs and words without was not observable
in the unimpaired model, when we affected the veridicality
of the input to the model, differences between these word
types was seen. Digraphs were less vulnerable to
impairment than were single letters that mapped to
phonemes.
This was because the model was able to take lowered
activation from both letters of the digraph to produce a
pronunciation for that phoneme. In contrast, the words
without digraphs had to be processed in a componential
way, such that an impairment to the activation of a single
letter had a profound effect on the models ability to process
the pronunciation dependent on that letter.
Alternative traditions of modeling reading vary in the
extent to which they explicitly encode graphemes in words.
Our model did not specify the graphemes in the language,
yet we showed that a parallel distributed processing model
of reading can discover different grain sizes in the course of
learning to map single letters onto phonemes, and that
therefore an explicit level of representation for the
graphemes at the input level might not be needed. The
model developed sensitivity to the graphemes as a
consequence of the regularities in the lexicon in mapping
letters and sets of letters onto phonemes.
We then applied the prediction raised by the model to
investigate whether graphemes might have a special status
in reading in adults, as suggested by previous studies (Rey,
Jacobs, Schmidt-Weigand & Ziegler, 1998; Rey, Ziegler
and Jacobs, 2000). These studies did not test participants on
a reading task directly, but instead used either word
identification or a letter detection task to test the special
status of graphemes. Although consistent with the main
assumption that graphemes are perceptual units in reading,
these studies did not directly demonstrate that digraphs had
a differential effect on word naming tasks.
In the behavioral study we confirmed the prediction made
by the model that words with digraphs are more robust to an
impairment to the visual input for reading. When we
controlled sets of words for length, neighbours, frequency,
and predictability of the word, we found that, when
pixellated noise was added to the left of visually presented
words, the words containing digraphs were read more

reduce contrast. A brief practice session preceded the
experiment.

Results
Participants made errors that affected exclusively the first
and/or second phonemes of the words for a mean of 42% of
the responses. The same scoring procedure used for the
model was implemented to score the participants responses.
The digital noise added to the frame was therefore
successful in impairing specifically the beginning (left side)
of the words.
A Linear Mixed Effects Analysis (Baayen, 2007) was
performed with the factor “digraph” as a fixed effect and
words and participants as random effects. A word was
judged to be read accurately only if all its phonemes were
pronounced correctly. A main effect of digraph status was
found, with words with digraphs being reported more
accurately than words without, F(1, 107.998) = 17.177,
p<.01 (see Figure 6).

Discussion
The results from the behavioral experiment confirmed the
prediction that words containing digraphs are read more
accurately than control words without when participants
view words with noise that impairs accurate perception of
the stimuli. The effect cannot be accounted for by the use of
guessing strategies, nor by variables such as length or
frequency (at the word level or bigram level), as those
variables were controlled across the two groups of stimuli
used. The experiment provides direct evidence that the size
of the graphemes in the word have a differential effect on
reading, indicating different grain size effects within a
language during reading.

General Discussion
The present study explored grain size effects in reading
using a computational model of reading single words in
English, and a behavioral study testing a prediction raised
by the model’s performance. Ziegler and Goswami’s (2005)
theoretical model of different grain size effects in different
orthographies proposed that the extent to which letters
mapped regularly and compositionally onto phonemes in

accurately than words with one-to-one letter-phoneme
mappings.
Taken together, the modeling work determined that
different computational properties of the mapping between
letters and phonemes suggested that psycholinguistic effects
of words should vary according to the compositionality of
the mapping. The behavioral study confirmed that these
computational properties do have a profound effect on
reading, at least under conditions where the visual input is
impaired. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that
graphemes have a special status in reading, due to their
computational properties, and that they emerge in the course
of a system learning the regularities between orthographic
and phonological representations of words.
