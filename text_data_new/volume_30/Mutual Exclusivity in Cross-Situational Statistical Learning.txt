ultimately discover correct word-referent associations. With
respect to the above example, a learner may hear the words
"toma" and "bosa" in the ambiguous context of seeing both a
loofah and gyroscope without any information as to which
word refers to which object. Although the mappings cannot
be determined from this single situation, the learner could
nonetheless solve the problem by keeping track of cooccurrences and non-occurrences across situations. Using
this example, if the learner viewed a second scene with a
spatula and gyroscope while hearing "diti" and "toma," and
could combine co-occurrence probabilities across these two
situations, the learner could correctly infer that "toma" maps
to gyroscope, “bosa” to loofah, and “diti” to spatula. Recent
empirical evidence has shown successful cross-trial learning
in ambiguous situations in both adults (Yu & Smith, 2007)
and children (Smith & Yu, 2008). Yu & Smith (2007)
exposed adults to a series of 27 ambiguous trials, each
containing 4 unknown words and 4 possible referents. Their
participants learned 9.5 out of 18 mappings in less than 6
minutes. Thus, humans can use statistical information across
multiple situations to learn word-object mappings by storing,
computing, and continuously reducing a set of possible
referents over time.
The present study intends to investigate the ME constraint
in the cross-situational learning paradigm. Can adults learn
multiple one-to-many word-referent pairings across a number
of ambiguous learning trials? Since most previous ME
experiments have focused on one-trial learning, and previous
cross-situational language learning experiments used one-toone stimuli, it is unclear what to expect. There are two
potential outcomes. One is that human learners rely on mutual
exclusivity in cross-situational learning in much the same
way as in single-trial learning. As a result, they may still build
one-to-one mappings while ignoring additional statistical
regularities in the training data, or they may fail to learn at all
due to the one-to-many confusion. This would suggest that
ME is an additional constraint in cross-situational language
learning. Alternatively, learners may break the mutual
exclusivity constraint across multiple learning trials,
demonstrating one-to-many mapping at test. This result
would provide support for cross-situational learning as a
fundamental mechanism supporting human learning in
general, and word learning in particular.

Abstract
The Mutual Exclusivity (ME) constraint – a preference for
mapping one word to one object – has been shown to be a
powerful aid to children learning new words. We ask whether
cross-situational language learning, in which word meanings are
learned through computation of word-object co-occurrences
across a series of highly ambiguous trials, is subject to the ME
constraint. Our results show that participants can break the
constraint to learn one-to-two word-referent mappings both when
the referents are separated across time and when they are
interleaved. This demonstrates the robustness of cross-situational
statistical learning. We then use participants’ ratings of their
knowledge after individual trials to shed light on the underlying
learning mechanism. Our results suggest that the ME constraint
may be applied at multiple points along learning – within a single
trial, across trials, and at test – which may explain one of its
residual test effects found in the traditional language literature.

Introduction
The Mutual Exclusivity (ME) constraint – a preference for
building one-to-one word-referent mappings – plays a critical
role in human word learning. In Markman and Wachtel’s
(1988) classic experiment, a child is presented with a known
object (ball) and an unknown object (gyroscope) and is asked
by the experimenter to bring the “toma”. Having never before
heard “toma,” the child will select the novel object gyroscope
as its referent, but not the object ball, which already has a
name. Since this original experiment, mutual exlcusivity has
been reliably demonstrated in various studies. Subsequent
research has also proposed several potential explanations for
children’s behavior, such as the Principle of Contrast (Clark,
1983), the Novel-Name-Nameless-Category Principle
(Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, Bailey, & Wenger, 1992), and a
Pragmatic Account (Diesendruck & Markson, 2001). Further,
the ME constraint provides a powerful and reliable
mechanism to deal with the reference uncertainty problem
(Quine, 1960) in a single learning trial. Given a novel word
and multiple potential referents, learners can apply mutual
exclusivity to rule out those referents with known names and
determine the correct referent on a single trial.
Recently, an alternative solution has been proposed to deal
with the uncertainty in word learning: cross-situational
statistics (Yu & Smith, 2007). A learner who is unable to
determine the correct word-referent mappings in a single
learning trial can nonetheless accumulate cross-trial statistics
from a number of individually ambiguous training trials to

Experiment 1
Following the cross-situational learning paradigm presented
by Yu and Smith (2007), we asked participants to

715

simultaneously learn many word-referent pairs from a
sequence of highly ambiguous learning trials. On each trial,
learners were presented with 4 words and 4 objects without
any information as to which referred to which. Thus, only 4
of the 16 possible pairings were correct on each trial.
Although individual trials were ambiguous, words always cooccured with their correct referents.
The key manipulation in the present study was to introduce
another kind of word-referent ambiguity on top of the withintrial ambiguity. Specifically, the whole training set could be
viewed as two halves. In the first half, learners were exposed
to one set of word-referent pairings (e.g. A-a1). Then, in the
second half, the same words co-occurred with new referents
(A-a2) in the absence of the previously presented referents
(A-a1). Participants were not told that there would be a
switch. Thus, word A was mapped to two referents a1 and a2
over the whole training session.
Which pairings would participants learn? Three outcomes
were possible. First, participants could have treated the later
trials as disconfirming evidence of the first word-referent
pairs (A occuring without a1), acquired the new pairings (Aa2), and rejected those learned previously. Second, learning
one referent for a word may have caused learners to reject
further associations (A-a2) and to maintain acquired lexical
knowledge (A-a1). Third, learners may have accepted both
pairings. The first two results would support a strong ME
constraint in cross-situational learning, while the third would
clearly indicate that the constraint can be broken.
Two characteristics of this paradigm are worth noting.
First, as shown in Figure 1, learners needed to solve the above
problem in the context of many simultaneously co-occurring
words and referents (A-a1, A-a2, B-b1, B-b2, C-c1, etc.)
across few, highly ambiguous exposures to each individual
pairing. Second, participants were not told in advance that
some words mapped to two referents instead of one. Thus, we
intended to measure their learning performance in a
naturalistic context without providing additional cues to
influence their learning processes.

pseudowords were computer generated to broadly sample
phonotactically-probable English forms and were produced
by a synthetic female voice in monotone. 54 unique objects
and 36 unique pseudowords were divided into three sets of 18
objects and 12 words. Each set of words was further divided
into 6 single words, which were mapped to one unique object,
and 6 double words, which were mapped to two unique
objects. The first object for these double words will be
referred to as the primacy referent, and the second as the
recency referent. Each set thus contained 18 correct wordreferent pairings to be discovered by the learner, and words
and referents were presented 6 times each. However, because
16 potential associations could be made between the 4 words
and 4 referents in each trial, learners experienced other
“spurious” associations that made learning from individual
trials difficult.
Referents of single words occurred randomly across all
training trials. Each double word’s first (primacy) referent
occurred all 6 times in the first half of the trials, while the
second (recency) referent occurred all 6 times only in the
second half. As shown in Figure 1, the first half of the trials
contained pairings of single words with their referents and
double words with their primacy referents, while the second
half contained the remaining occurrences of each single word
with its referent along with all double word to recency
referent pairings.
Each training slide consisted of 4 pictures, one in each
corner of the screen, and 4 corresponding words, heard
serially. There was no relationship between object and screen
position, or screen position and word order. Each slide began
with 2 seconds of silence, each word played for 1 second, and
2 seconds of silence were inserted between words for a total
duration of 12 seconds per trial. Each training session
consisted of 27 such slides, and each correct word-referent
mapping was seen 6 times. Training slides were constructed
the same way across all conditions.
Participants were tested after completion of each training
phase. Test slides consisted of one trained word presented
along with four pictures, one in each corner of the screen.
One slide was made for each word, and they were presented
in random order. Participants indicated the correct referent for
a word by clicking on its picture. The pictures present varied
by test condition. Single word tests were the same in each
condition – one picture was the correct referent and the other
three were foils (referents for other words). In the Primacy
condition, each double word test consisted of the word’s
primacy referent (a1, etc.) and 3 foils. In the Recency
condition, each double test consisted of the word’s recency
referent (a2, etc.) and 3 foils. In the Both condition, each
double test consisted of both the primacy referent and recency
referent and 2 foils. Thus, the primacy and the recency items
were both present, and competed with each other, in the Both
condition.

Figure 1: Participants learned one-to-two word-referent mappings
(represented X-x1 and X-x2) in the context of 4 words and 4
referents per trial. For these double words, the first referent (x1)
appeared exclusively in the first half of the trials while the second
referent (x2) appeared only in the second half.

Subjects
Participants were forty-eight undergraduates who received
course credit for volunteering. None had previously
participated in any cross-situational learning experiments.

Procedure

Stimuli

Participants were told that they would be seeing pictures of
objects and hearing words, and that they should try to
determine which referred to which. They then engaged in

The stimuli were slides consisting of pictures of uncommon
objects paired with auditorally presented pseudowords. These

suggests that while mutual exclusivity did not prevent the
acquisition of a second referent, it did produce a bias in favor
of the first. This result is in line with a similar finding in the
single-trial learning domain. Doherty (2004) trained children
on second meanings for known words (for instance the word
“cake” could also refer to a tapir). When read a story and
asked to point to the object referred to by the homonymous
word, children successfully chose the new meaning.
However, when the referent corresponding to the known
meaning (cake) was one of the test options, children often
selected it even when the new referent was contextually
appropriate. This first-referent preference also generalized to
two consecutively learned meanings for novel words. Thus,
mutual exclusivity may have driven primacy selection at test
even when both referents were learned.

three training sessions each followed by one of the three test
conditions. Test conditions were counterbalanced for order.

Results
First, participants clearly learned both single and double
words in all three test conditions. Even the lowest accuracy,
for double referents in the Recency test condition, was
significantly above chance (M = .510, t(47) = 5.237, p <
.001). Thus, participants learned even under ME violations.
Second, accuracy for single words did not differ by test
condition (MPrimary = .642; MRecency=.642; MBoth = .642,
F(2,47) = .016, p > .05). Equivalence of these control words
provides evidence that the three test conditions are directly
comparable. A 2x2 ANOVA with factors of word-type
(single or double) and test condition (Primacy or Recency)
showed a significant effect of word type (F(1,47) = 11.455, p
< .002) but not condition (F(1,47) = .760, p > .05) and no
interaction (F(1,47) = 1.580, p > .05). Thus, single words
were learned better.
Because double words were tested against two correct
referents in the Both condition, they cannot be directly
compared with single words. Instead, we compared choice
frequency of primacy and recency referents in the Both
condition. Figure 2 shows the significant preference effect,
with primacy referents being chosen almost twice as
frequently as recency referents (Mprimary = .524,
Mrecency=.292; t(1,47) = 3.403, p < .002).

Experiment 2
Experiment 1 revealed that learners are able to break the
mutual exclusivity constraint to acquire one-to-two wordreferent mappings in cross-situational learning. However,
successful learning in Experiment 1 may have been due to the
temporal separation of the primacy and recency referents.
That is, double-primacy pairings occurred only in the first
half of training, while double-recency pairings occurred only
in the second half. In Experiment 2, we removed this
separation. As shown in Figure 3, primacy and recency
referents occurred in random order across trials. Thus, if one
trial contained word A and referent a1, the very next trial
could contain A and a2 (but not a1).

Subjects
Participants were forty-eight undergraduates who received
course credit. None had participated in Experiment 1 or any
other cross-situational word learning experiments.

Stimuli and Procedure
Stimuli for Experiment 2 were identical to those used in
Experiment 1, except that the two halves of training were
shuffled together such that primacy and recency occurrences
were interleaved across time.

(represented X-x1 and X-x2) in the context of 4 words and 4

occurrences were interleaved across the entire training set.

Discussion
While participants were more accurate on referents of single
words, they successfully learned both double word referents,
breaking the constraint of mutual exclusivity. Thus, learning
the primacy referent did not prevent learning of the recency
referent, and learning the recency referent did not force
rejection of the learned primacy referent. Our results also
reveal that learners can concurrently keep track of multiple
word-referent mappings, which may explain their impressive
performance in cross-situational learning.
Interestingly, participants showed a strong preference for
the primacy referent when presented with both at test. This

Figure 4 shows the results of Experiment 2. In all three test
conditions, and for both single and double words, participant
accuracy was significantly above chance (smallest Mrecency =
.517, t(47) = 6.238, p < .001). A comparison of single word
accuracy across test conditions showed no significant
differences (F(2,47) = .822, p > .05).

uncertainty for single words on a given trial relative to the
equivalent trial in Experiment 2.

We again performed a 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA
comparing single and double words in the Primacy and
Recency test conditions. This time we found no effect of
either condition (F(1,47) = .426, p > .05) or word-type
(F(1,47) = 1.419, p > .05). Essentially, single word accuracy
dropped to levels comparable to that of double words. We
also compared primacy and recency selection frequency in
the Both condition. Unlike in Experiment 1, we found no
significant difference (t(1,47) = .724, p > .05).
We then compared accuracy across the two experiments.
Here we found a significant main effect of experiment on
single word accuracy (t(1,286) = 2.78, p < .01) but no effect
of experiment on double accuracy in the Primacy and
Recency conditions (t(1,190) = .580, p > .05) or total double
accuracy in the Both condition (t(1,46) = 1.595, p > .05).

Experiments 3a-b
Experiments 1 and 2 documented behavioral evidence of the
robustness of cross-situational statistical learning – learners
were able to effectively acquire statistical regularities of
word-referent mappings by breaking the ME constraint.
However, the underlying learning mechanism remained
unclear. In Experiments 3a and 3b, we asked participants to
report their level of knowledge of each referent trial by trial.
This allowed us to assess their moment-by-moment learning
and infer their internal knowledge states.

Subjects
Ninety-six undergraduates volunteered in exchange for course
credit. None had participated in Experiments 1 or 2 or any
other cross-situational word learning experiments. Half
participated in Experiment 3a and half in 3b.

Stimuli and Procedure
Stimuli were identical to those used in Experiments 1 and 2.
After each trial, participants were asked to enter a confidence
rating for each picture by clicking a horizontal bar labelled 1
to 10 that appeared below it. After a rating was given for all 4
pictures, a button appeared in the center of the screen
allowing the participant to move to the next trial. Input bars
responded to multiple clicks, allowing participants to revise
individual rating. Participants were given the same
instructions as before, indicating that they should try to learn
the mappings between words and objects. They were also told
that a 1-10 scale would appear below each picture, and that
they should indicate how confident they were that they knew
the correct word for the corresponding picture. Trial ordering
for Experiment 3a was equivalent to that of Experiment 1 and
ordering for Experiment 3b was equivalent to that of
Experiment 2.

conditions. Errors bars represent +/-SE.

Discussion
In Experiment 2, participants were able to learn one-to-two
word-object mappings even when the two referents were
interleaved during training. Whereas participants in
Experiment 1 could have learned first one of the pairings and
then the other, participants in Experiment 2 had to learn both
simultaneously. Interestingly, double words were learned
equally well in Experiments 1 and 2, suggesting that the
temporal ordering had little effect on their difficulty. Thus the
learning mechanism responsible for one-to-many mappings in
cross-situational learning appears to operate in the same
fashion in both cases.
Surprisingly, single and double words were learned equally
well in Experiment 2. A cross-experiment comparison shows
this to be the result of poorer single word learning in
Experiment 2. Two explanations are possible. First,
interleaved double referent ordering may have prompted
learners in Experiment 2 to build many-to-one mappings for
single words. As a result, they would not have been able to
take advantage of mutual exclusivity for these words. An
alternative explanation concerns the number of spurious
correlations possible in the two learning conditions. In
Experiment 1, single words co-occur only with primacy
referents in the first half of the trials and only with recency
referents in the second half. This reduces the degree of

Results
Experiment 3a Tests Forced-choice test results showed
similar patterns to those found in Experiment 1. Participant
accuracy was significantly above chance for both single and
double words in all three conditions (smallest MRecency = .52,
t(47) = 5.336, p < .001). A comparison of single word
accuracy across test conditions again showed no significant
differences (F(2,47) = .753, p > .05). A 2x2 repeated
measures ANOVA for word type and condition showed a
marginal main effect of word type (F(1,47) = 10.642, p =
.071), but no effect of condition (F(1,47) = 1.992, p > .05),
and no interaction (F(1,47) = .060, p > .05). Comparison of
primacy and recency selection in the Both condition showed a
significant primacy bias (t(1,47) = 2.312, p < .03).
Experiment 3b Tests Analyses of forced-choice test results
showed similar patterns to Experiment 2. Accuracy was
significantly above chance for both word types in all three test
conditions (smallest MPrimacy = .49, t(47) = 5.754, p < .001). A
comparison of single word accuracy across test conditions

718

showed no significant differences (F(2,47) = 1.429, p > .05).
A 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA for word type and
condition showed an effect of word type (F(1,47) = 4.407, p
= .05) but no effect of condition (F(1,47) = .22, p > .05) and
no interaction (F(1,47) = 3.685, p > .05). No difference was
found between primacy and recency selection in the Both
condition (t(1,47) = 1.047, p > .05).
Confidence Data Validity In Experiment 3, we were
primarily interested in using participants’ confidence scores
as a moment-to-moment measure of their learning states. To
do so, we first asked whether participants’ ratings accurately
reflected their levels of knowledge. Since each referent
occurred 6 times per training session, participants provided 6
ratings per referent. We averaged ratings by occurrence
number across all referents to produce 6 values per participant
– one for each occurrence number. Table 1 shows correlations
between confidence scores and accuracy for each occurrence.
There is a strong increasing trend across occurrences, with a
significant positive correlation on all occurrences after the
first.

Figure 5: Confidence ratings provided by a subject in Experiment
3b. Rows correspond to individual referents and columns to
individual trials. Two-to-one word-referent mappings are coded as
X-x1 and X-x2. Just like the highlighted pairings H-h1 and H-h2,
most double words showed increasing confidence scores across
time for both primary and recency referents.

Next we examined the factors that influence the confidence
rating of a specific referent trial by trial. We included rating
on its most recent occurrence, experiment, word type (single
or double), referent type (single, primacy, or recency), and
also the average of the ratings of the three co-occurring
referents on their most recent occurrences. A stepwise linear
regression found significant effects of previous rating (β =
.301, t(92) = 50.221, p < .001), double (β = -.019, t(92) = 5.148, p < .001), and the average of the co-occurring
referents’ previous ratings (β = .491, t(92) = 81.909, p <
.001). Participant confidence for a referent was thus
influenced not only by word type and knowledge of the same
referent from previous experiences, but also by previous
knowledge of the other co-occurring referents in the same
trial.

Figure 5 shows confidence data from one subject. Each row
corresponds to an individual referent, and each column to a
trial of the training session. On each trial, 4 confidence scores
(four column cells) were given, one for each of the presented
referents. The numerical scale used by our participants has
been mapped to a gray scale, with brighter squares indicating
higher confidence ratings.
Confidence Data Results We first examined the primacy test
bias found in Experiment 1. We computed a 2x3x6 Mixed
ANOVA with a between-subjects factor of Experiment (a or
b), and within-subjects factors of referent type (single,
primacy, or recency), and occurrence (1-6). We found
significant main effects of referent type (F(2,95) = 4.808, p <
.01) and occurrence (F(5, 95) = 158.491, p < .001) and a
marginal effect of experiment (F(1, 47) = 3.491, p = .065).
Two-way interactions were significant between referent-type
and occurrence (F(10,95) = 5.413, p < .001), referent-type
and experiment (F(2,95) = 7.155, p = .001), and occurrence
and experiment (F(5,95) = 6.522, p < .01). The three-way
interaction was also significant (F(10,47) = 13.556, p <
.001). As shown in Figure 6, ratings increase with
occurrence, were higher for single and primacy referents in
Experiment 3a relative to 3b, and recency was significantly
different from primacy in 3a, but not 3b.

Figure 6: Confidence level by occurrence in Experiment 3

719

demonstrated by Doherty (2004), is reproduced in our results.
Experiment 3a allows us to offer a possible explanation.
While participants demonstrated equal objective knowledge
of each referent, they showed significantly higher confidence
in their knowledge of the first referent beginning with its
second training trial. This subjective feeling of superior
knowledge may drive test preference for the first learned
referent.
Finally, the use of the cross-situational paradigm and trialby-trial confidence ratings allowed us to examine mutual
exclusivity from a new angle. Standard language learning
experiments have shown mutual exclusivity to have a strong
effect on a single trial. Our cross-situational investigation
suggests that the ME constraint can be applied at multiple
points: within a single trial, across trials, and at test. We
found that application at these levels is not completely
dependent – participants who broke mutual exclusivity on a
cross-trial basis still apply it within-trial, and in some
conditions during testing. The obvious complexity of
applying the ME principle in cross-situational learning
suggest a promising direction for future research.

Discussion
In Experiment 3 we used confidence ratings provided by
participants on each trial to assess the role of mutual
exclusivity as learning progresses. These ratings allowed us to
answer two main questions: first, what drove the primacy test
bias in Experiment 1? Second, how was mutual exclusivity
used within each trial?
To answer the first question, we examined confidence
rating growth for each referent type over time, finding two
patterns. First, participants were more confident in general in
Experiment 3a than 3b, indicating impaired learning of even
single words due to the interspersed ordering of double
words. Second, we found that confidence for recency
referents lagged behind confidence for primacy and single
referents in Experiment 3a, but not 3b. This may explain the
primacy bias in Experiment 1. While participants formed
equally strong associations with both of a double word’s
referents, they had stronger conscious feelings of knowledge
for the primacy referent, and thus preferred it at test.
We addressed the second question via regression analysis.
As expected, the confidence rating assigned to a referent on a
given occurrence was influenced by how well it was
previously known. However, it was even more heavily
influenced by how well the co-occuring referents were
known, suggesting the application of mutual exclusivity.
Participants who knew labels for the co-occuring referents
could rule them out within-trial as labels for the referent in
question. Thus, even though participants broke the mutual
exclusivity constraint across trials, they used it to bootstrap
their learning within trials.

General Discussion
We began by offering cross-situational statistics as an
alternative to the constraint-based approach to language
learning. However, all previous cross-situational language
learning experiments used stimuli compliant with the mutual
exclusivity constraint. Our results demonstrate the robustness
of cross-situational learning even in the face of stimuli that
violate ME both in serial (Experiments 1 and 3a) and in
parallel (Experiments 2 and 3b). Although participants were
impaired by these manipulations, their enduring performance
is strong evidence for cross-situational statistics as a
fundamental mechanism supporting word learning. This point
is further reinforced by the emerging relationship between
findings in this paradigm and those in the classical literature.
The primacy bias found in Experiment 1 and replicated in
Experiment 3a maps nicely to results found of research on
homonym learning. Although most work on mutual
exclusivity has focused on two-to-one word-object violations
(Woodward & Markman, 1998), a growing body of research
is beginning to examine the reverse direction via homonyms
(for instance ‘steer’ is both the act of driving a car and a large
hoofed mammal). Children demonstrate impaired learning of
homonymous words as late as 10 years of age (Mazzoco,
1997). Test preference for a word’s first learned referent,
