Abstract

ones, such as theory of mind; however, our proposal is that
in order to adequately comprehend TBI patients’ pragmatic
deficits it is also important to take into account the
complexity of the mental representations activated during a
communicative exchange. In order to establish this
relationship, we compared patients’ pragmatic performance
with their performance on a series of neuropsychological
and ToM tests. Thus, we referred to our previous recent
study (Angeleri et al., 2008), in which we investigated a
wide range of pragmatic phenomena, and we compared
those results with the performance showed by the same
patients in different neuropsychological and ToM tests.
The paper is organized as follows. (1) We briefly examine
the communicative impairments in the TBI population. (2)
We review the current literature that is focused on the
relationship
between
cognitive
functioning
and
communication. (3) We present our theoretical framework,
with the intent of specifying how mental representations of
increasing complexity can affect different levels of ability in
communicative tasks. (4) We present our experimental
materials, procedures, and results. (5) The paper ends with a
general discussion of our findings and their relevance in
understanding communicative impairments in TBI.

The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship
between cognitive functions such as attention, working
memory, long-term memory, planning, i.e. executive
functions, theory of mind, and pragmatic deficits resulting as
a consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Communicative disorders represent a typical outcome in TBI
patients, even if their linguistic abilities remain virtually
intact. We empirically investigated the role played by the
possible cognitive deficits in patients’ communicative
performance. In addition to the factors mentioned in the
current literature, such as planning and theory of mind, our
results show the importance of considering the increasing
complexity of the mental representations underlying different
pragmatic phenomena in order to better understand the
communicative outcomes after TBI.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a wide range of
communicative deficits, even if linguistic ability is usually
conserved; patients affected by TBI do not display classical
aphasic symptoms and their syntactical and lexical abilities
are often adequate (McDonald, 1993). According to the
current literature, it is possible to identify three principal
cognitive components for explaining the communicative
deficits in TBI: executive functions, theory of mind (ToM),
and inferential processes. Theories based on the first two
factors provide for a global explanation of the deficit,
without fine differentiation between different pragmatic
phenomena. Theories based on inferential processes provide
a more articulated differentiation but, from our perspective,
they underestimate the role of specific cognitive processes,
namely the complexity of mental representations, in
explaining TBI patients’ communicative ability.
The present research is an exploratory investigation aimed
at clarifying the role played by the different cognitive
functions in pragmatic outcomes after TBI. In our opinion,
different cognitive functions are involved in explaining
patients’ communicative deficits, from the more basic, such
as working memory and attention, to the more sophisticated

Communicative ability in TBI
TBI patients show a series of communicative difficulties,
loading on all the dimensions that characterize satisfying
communicative interactions. TBI patients show several
difficulties at various levels in comprehension tasks, i.e.
they cannot go beyond the literal meaning of sentences
(Winner & Gardner, 1977), they don’t understand
implicatures and sarcastic utterances (McDonald & Pearce,
1996), and commercial messages which require inferential
processes in order to be understood (Pearce, McDonald &
Coltheart, 1998). Moreover, TBI patients may show
different forms of linguistic production impairment, such as
in producing clear requests (McDonald & Van Sommers,
1993) or giving complete information to interlocutors
(McDonald, 1993). Not only the linguistic dimension can
show pragmatic impairments, but also the extralinguistic

805

modality may be affected and, consequently, patients may
show a pronounced difficulty in communicating through
gestures (Bara, Cutica & Tirassa, 2001). In order to assess
patients’ linguistic and extralinguistic pragmatic abilities,
we analyzed the results published in a recent study by our
group (Angeleri et al., 2008), correlating them with new
unpublished data referring to the performance of the same
patients in different neuropsychological and ToM tests. The
results (briefly summarized below) showed widespread
impairment in all of the investigated communicative
dimensions, which reaffirms the importance of
understanding the cognitive basis of communicative
competence, which is not restricted at the areas that are
involved in linguistic performance.

concerns the expression and interpretation of the speaker
rather than the literal meaning. Such authors highlight the
role of inferential processes underlying communicative
interaction. Within the general inferential domain, the
Cognitive Pragmatics theory identifies specific mental
cognitive processes, namely the complexity of mental
representations, which allow interlocutors to interpret
communicative exchanges. Cognitive Pragmatics (Airenti et
al., 1993; Bara, 2008) is a theory of the cognitive processes
underlying human communication that holds both for
linguistic and extralinguistic communication, distinguishing
between different kinds of communicative phenomena –
standard communication acts, deceit, irony– on the basis of
the mental representations involved in their comprehension
and production. In particular, the theory explains and
predicts the difficulty in the comprehension of different
communication acts in typical development (Bucciarelli,
Colle & Bara, 2003) and in autistic children (Bara,
Bucciarelli & Colle, 2001), and it offers a plausible account
for the decay of pragmatic performance in brain-damaged
patients (Bara, Tirassa & Zettin, 1997).
Within the framework of the Cognitive Pragmatics theory,
Bucciarelli et al. (2003) provided a fine-grained theoretical
explanation of the cognitive factors underlying the
comprehension of standard, deceitful, and ironic speech
acts. In standard communication, default rules of inference
govern the comprehension of a communicative act (Reiter,
1980); in standard communication, such as direct and
indirect speech acts, what the actor says is in line with his
private beliefs. In terms of mental representations, to
comprehend a standard communicative act the partner has
only to refer the communicative act proffered by the
interlocutor to the behavioral game1 shared with him. By
contrast, non-standard communication involves the
comprehension and production of communicative acts via
the blocking of default rules and the occurrence of more
complex mental representations. In particular, in deceit the
actor’s communicative intention is in conflict with his
private mental states but it does not contrast with the
knowledge that he share with the partner; consequently, in
the case of disclosed deceit, the partner recognizes the
difference between the mental states that are expressed and
those that the actor privately entertains. Finally, in irony the
actor’s communicative intention is again in conflict with his
private mental states, but it also contrasts with the
knowledge that he share with the partner: this makes an
ironic communicative act more difficult to perform than a
deceitful one. The increasing trend of difficulty in the
comprehension of standard, deceit and irony has been
experimentally validated in studies on children (Bucciarelli
et al., 2003; Bosco et al., 2004) and the same trend has been
found for the production of communicative acts as
expressed both through linguistic and extralinguistic means
in TBI patients (Angeleri et al., 2008).

Cognitive functions and communication
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the
cognitive aspects underlying pragmatic impairment (i.e.,
Perkins, 2000). In particular, some authors have suggested
that cognitive abilities, such as executive functions and
theory of mind, play a central role in the pragmatic
performance of brain-damaged subjects (Happé, Brownell
& Winner, 1999; Martin & McDonald, 2003). TBI patients
often suffer damage in the frontal lobe, the brain area
involved in executive functioning - the construct used to
describe the goal-directed behavior - and some authors
explain the pragmatic deficit displayed by these individuals
as being caused mainly by executive function impairment
(McDonald & Pearce, 1998). Theory of Mind is the ability
to ascribe mental states to oneself and to other people and to
use such knowledge to interpret one’s own as well as other
people’s behaviors. Some authors highlight the role of the
ToM in human communication (Happé & Loth, 2002;
Tirassa, Bosco & Colle, 2006). A developed and intact
capacity to mindread is necessary to comprehend a partner’s
communicative intention. The relation between ToM and
communicative ability is particularly apparent in the autistic
pathology. Baron-Cohen, Leslie and Frith (1985) explained
how the social and communicative problems, which are
typically demonstrated by these patients, are caused by a
ToM deficit. Only a few studies in the literature have
investigated the relationship between TBI and ToM, but a
possible link has been established (Bibby & McDonald,
2005), and for this reason it is important to clarify whether
the pragmatic deficits in TBI patients are caused by their
difficulties in ToM abilities.
We suggest that impaired executive functions or ToM skills
are not sufficient to fully explain communicative deficits in
TBI patients. In our perspective, more specific cognitive
processes are responsible for interpreting communicative
exchanges (see the paragraph on Cognitive Pragmatics
theory).

Cognitive Pragmatics theory
Most authors within the pragmatic domain (Airenti, Bara &
Colombetti, 1993; Bara, 2008; Searle, 1975; Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) point out that communicative understanding

between the participants involved in a communicative interaction
(see Airenti et al., 1993; Bara, 2008).

the Sally & Ann Task and a selection of six Strange Stories
(excluding those testing communicative phenomena such as
irony, metaphor, and social appropriateness) for theory of
mind abilities.

The present research aims to investigate the role of
cognitive functions in the communicative abilities of TBI
patients. From our perspective, cognitive functions support
communication, but are not enough by themselves to
explain the whole of TBI communicative outcomes. Rather,
specific mental representations, such as those pointed out by
the Cognitive Pragmatics theory, are required to modulate
communicative ability. Regarding cognitive functioning, we
expect TBI patients to perform worse than normal controls
in all the cognitive tasks proposed, involving short and
long-term memory, attention, planning, and theory of mind.
Moreover, in the TBI group, we will explore the
relationship between cognitive functions and pragmatic
deficits, evaluated through our experimental protocol. We
predict that deficits in cognitive functioning are involved in
the pragmatic performance, but also that they don’t play a
strict causal role in determining the communicative
outcomes.

Participants
The TBI group consisted of 21 TBI patients (5 female/16
male) ranging in age from 20 to 68 yrs (M = 36.9; SD =
12.5); their education ranged from 5 to 18 yrs of schooling
(M = 10.9; SD = 3.3). The patients were recruited through
different rehabilitation centers in Geneva and Turin. The
time after onset ranged from 3 to 252 months (M = 59.5; SD
= 69.8); all patients had sustained their individual injury in a
road traffic accident. All patients were Italian native
speakers; initial exclusion criteria were prior history of TBI
or other neurological disease, neuropsychiatric illness or
communication problems, pre-morbid alcohol or drug
addiction. TBI patients had to pass a series of
neuropsychological tests to rule out the possibility of being
too seriously cognitively impaired. The screening battery
included the Mini-Mental State Examination, Raven’s
Coloured Progressive Matrices, and the denomination scale
of the Aachener Aphasie Test. In the control group, there
were 33 healthy participants, matched to the patients group
for age, sex, and years of education.

Material and Procedure
Communicative abilities. The experimental protocol
consists of 2 different evaluation scales: (1) Linguistic, and
(2) Extralinguistic. The protocol comprises a total of 48
items, based on videotaped scenes. Each scene lasts 20-25
seconds and presents a controlled number of words (7±2).
Each scale includes both comprehension and production
tasks. In more details, the linguistic scale assesses the
comprehension and production of communication acts
expressed primarily through linguistic means, whereas the
extralinguistic scale assess the same pragmatic phenomena
but are only expressed through extralinguistic means. The
phenomena evaluated in those two scales are: standard
communicative acts, deceits, and ironies.
All TBI participants and normal controls were videotaped.
Subjects’ performance was coded offline from the videotape
by two independent judges blind to the aim of the research
and to the subject’s identity (TBI vs. control). For each task,
subjects could obtain a score of 0 or 1, corresponding to a
correct (1 point) or incorrect (0 point) answer. The interrater agreement was calculated using Intraclass Correlation
Coefficient (ICC), estimated on the means of the total
scores for each pragmatic phenomenon. The ICC was 0.87,
indicating almost perfect agreement (Altman, 1991).
Cognitive functions. A series of neuropsychological tests
were administered to both TBI patients and normal controls
in order to assess the most important cognitive functions,
with two main goals: (1) to compare the TBI performance
with that of the controls and (2) to investigate, in the TBI
group, the possible relationship between cognitive
impairment and pragmatic performance revealed through
our protocol. The subjects were administered the Trail
Making Test and the Attentive Matrices for attention
abilities; the Verbal and Spatial Span for working memory
and the Immediate and Deferred Recall test for long-term
verbal memory; the Elithorn’s Maze Test and the Tower of
London for planning abilities; finally, the Smarties’ Task,

Results

TBI patients in Table 1 (for a more detailed analysis, see

Production

As shown in Table 1, the TBI group overall performed
worse than the control group in all of the scales (T Test:

807

4.54 < t < 5.73; p < .0001). To investigate the patients’
performance in comprehension and production of standard,
deceitful and ironic communication acts, we conducted
ANOVAs with one between-subjects factor (type of
subjects, with two levels: patient and control) and one
within-subjects factor (type of phenomenon, with three
levels: standard, deceit and irony), both for linguistic and
extralinguistic scales. Those analyses confirmed that TBI
patients performed significantly worse than controls in all
tasks, and revealed that there was a main effect of the type
of pragmatic phenomenon in linguistic comprehension
(F(2,102) = 7.89; p = .001; η2 = .13), extralinguistic
comprehension (F(2,102) = 31.32; p < .0001; η2 = .38),
linguistic production (F(2,102) = 95.14; p < .0001; η2 = .65)
and extralinguistic production (F(2,102) = 71.84; p < .0001; η2
= .58). We introduced a linear contrast in each ANOVA
analysis, which revealed a linear decrease in scores
depending on the type of pragmatic phenomenon (13.69 < F
< 141.21; .001 < p < .0001; .21 < η2 < .73): standard
communication acts were the easiest, followed by deceits,
and finally by ironies, the most difficult task. In the present
paper, we present new data about patients’ cognitive
performance in order to investigate the possible
relationships between cognitive functions and pragmatic
performance. To investigate the patients’ performance in
neuropsychological tests we used a paired T Test with the
aim of comparing the TBI and control groups. The
difference was significant in all five cognitive functions
being investigated: attention, working memory (WM), long
term memory (LTM), planning and ToM (T Test: 4.49 < t <
12.8; p < .0001). The results obtained by TBI patients and
controls are summarized in Figure 1:

predictor variables planning – Model 2 – and theory of mind
abilities – Model 3 -, considered separately in order to
consider their unique effect on the dependent variable, i.e.

included in the regression model in order of their

that is: first attention, WM and LTM, next planning, and
finally ToM. Table 2 shows the adjusted determination

For the TBI group, multiple regression analyses were used
to determine the contribution of different cognitive abilities
to communicative performance. In Model 1 we considered
the basic cognitive abilities (attention, WM and LTM)
together; because they constantly underlie each task (the
items were created maintaining constant the attention and
memory requirement). Then, we created a hierarchical
model of multiple regression analysis, also including as

As shown in Table 2, the overall pragmatic performance
appears to be affected by various cognitive functions, but
this influence seems not enough to explain the patients’
performance. Attention, WM and LTM are involved, to a
certain extent, in every task: their predictor role remains

808

nearly constant throughout the tasks, at less than 17% of the
explained variance. The percentage of the explained
variance tends to increase with the inclusion of planning
abilities in all our tasks; however, the change in R2 is only
significant for the comprehension of linguistic irony (F(1,16)
= 7.44; p = .015) and for the comprehension of both
extralinguistic standard communication acts (F(1,16) = 5.15; p
= .04) and irony (F(1,16) = 8.75; p = .009). The percentage of
explained variance tends to increase in Model 3 for all our
tasks, but the role of theory of mind abilities as a predictor
of pragmatic performance is only significant for the
linguistic comprehension of deceit (F(1,16) = 8.98: p = .009),
for the extralinguistic comprehension of both standard
communication acts (F(1,16) = 6.18; p = .025) and deceit
(F(1,16) = 7.11; p = .02), and for the extralinguistic
production of deceit (F(1,16) = 8.83; p = .009).

their unique effects on the dependent variable, i.e. patients’
communicative performance. These variables were included
in the regression model following their increasing
hierarchical support for impacting performance. Our
analysis reveals that cognitive impairment plays a role in
explain communicative deficit, - patients perform worse
than the controls in all the communicative tasks - but it is
not sufficient to explain the whole TBI communicative
outcomes, which is to explain the patient’s increasing trend
of difficulty in the comprehension and production of
standard, deceitful and ironic communication acts. Some
cognitive functions – i.e. attention, WM and LTM – are able
to explain a proportion of the variability in communicative
performance in all the communication tasks. This seems
consistent with the idea that these basic cognitive functions
support the comprehension and production of each
communicative act, and for this reason we controlled these
parameters in our assessment battery (such as the length of
the sentence or the duration of each scene) in order to
require the same degree of these basic cognitive functions.
The percentage of explained variance tends to increase with
the inclusion of planning abilities in all the pragmatic tasks;
however, the change of explained variance is only
significant for a few phenomena, i.e. comprehension of
linguistic and extralinguistic irony, and comprehension of
both extralinguistic standard communicative acts.
In particular, we were interested in the role of Theory of
Mind, since some authors have suggested that in children
(Winner & Leekman, 1991) as well as in right hemisphere
brain-damaged patients (Winner, Brownell, Happé, Blum &
Pincus, 1998) that the increasing role of a more
sophisticated theory of mind ability may be the causal factor
in the emergence of difficulty in the comprehension of
verbal irony. We thus performed a multiple regression
analysis investigating the role of the theory of mind in our
various communicative tasks. The results show that deficits
in theory of mind tasks can explain a small proportion of the
variability of patients’ performance, and that they are not
enough to account for the specific communicative
impairment as revealed in our previous study. In particular,
how theory of mind underlies a specific task is explained by
the change in variance; this effect is only significant for
linguistic and extralinguistic comprehension of deceit,
extralinguistic comprehension of standard communicative
acts, and extralinguistic production of deceit.
To summarize, our analysis shows that the increasing
difficulty between deceit and irony that we found in both
comprehension and production seems better explained by
our theoretical framework, resorting in the manipulation of
mental representations of increasing complexity for both
linguistic and extralinguistic phenomena. Indeed, the role
played by Theory of Mind ability does not seem to explain
per se the differences in patients’ performance for deceit
and irony comprehension and production tasks.
We do not want to deny the role of ToM in communicative
interaction but, more generally, our results seem to support
the general conclusion, regarding TBI patients’

Conclusions
The aim of the present study was to investigate the
relationship between cognitive functioning and pragmatic
performance after TBI. According to our theoretical
framework, it is important to consider the complexity of the
mental representations underlying a different kind of
pragmatic phenomena in order to adequately understand the
patients’ performance. In particular, Cognitive Pragmatics
Theory (Airenti et al., 1993) posits that standard
communication acts involve easier mental representations,
whereas deceits and ironies involve more sophisticated
ones. In line with those predictions, in our recent study,
which was focused on TBI patients’ performance (Angeleri
et al., 2008), we found a trend of increasing difficulty in the
comprehension and production of standard, deceitful and
ironic communication acts. In our opinion, cognitive deficits
in ToM and executive functions are not enough to explain
this peculiar trend of difficulty. In order to investigate this
relationship, we referred to our previous results (Angeleri et
al., 2008) in a TBI population. In addition, we present new
data referring to the administration of a selection of
neuropsychological and ToM tests to the same patients and
controls. In particular, we administered tests investigating
working memory, long-term memory, attention, planning,
and theory of mind in order to enable the study of the role
held by different cognitive functions in the patients’
communicative deficits.
As expected from the relevant literature (Happé, Brownell
& Winner, 1999; Martin & McDonald, 2003; Bibby &
McDonald, 2005; Havet-Thomassin et al., 2006) TBI
patients performed worse in all the five cognitive areas
investigated. For the TBI group, we performed a multiple
regression analysis directed at exploring the possible causal
role of the cognitive deficit in communicative ability. In the
first model of the analysis we considered the basic cognitive
abilities (attention, WM and LTM) together as being equally
involved in all our tasks, and then created a hierarchical
model of multiple regression, also including planning –
Model 2 – and theory of mind abilities – Model 3 – as
predictor variables, considered separately in order to assess

809

communicative abilities, that various cognitive functions
support communicative performance, but the impairment of
none of them is unequivocally associated with the decay of
a single pragmatic phenomenon.
The present study thus highlights the importance of
considering all the contributing factors in order to explain
the communicative deficits in patients that are affected by
traumatic brain injury. In addition to ToM and executive
function abilities, our results show the role that is played by
the complexity of mental representations underlying the
ability to comprehend and produce different communicative
phenomena.
