Abstract
Binary information is prevalent in the environment. In this
study, we examined how people process repetition and
alternation in binary sequences. Across four paradigms
involving estimation, working memory, change detection, and
visual search, we found that the number of alternations is
under-estimated compared to repetitions (Experiment 1).
Moreover, recall for binary sequences deteriorates as the
sequence alternates more (Experiment 2). Changes in bits are
also harder to detect as the sequence alternates more
(Experiment 3). Finally, visual targets superimposed on bits
of a binary sequence take longer to process as alternation
increases (Experiment 4). Overall, our results indicate that
compared to repetition, alternation in a binary sequence is
less salient in the sense of requiring more attention for
successful encoding. The current study thus reveals the
cognitive constraints in the representation of alternation and
provides a new explanation for the over-alternation bias in
randomness perception.

Introduction
Perceptually, many events in the world can be interpreted as
binary, from the outcomes of coin flips to the daily
alternations between the sun and the moon. Past research
that examines the perception of binary information has
focused on the perception of randomness (Bar-Hillel &
Wagenaar, 1991; Nickerson, 2002) and regularities (Julesz,
1962; Lopes & Oden, 1987). Although it is difficult to
define randomness (Ayton et al., 1989; Beltrami, 1999;
Chater & Vitányi, 2003; Fitelson & Osherson, 2012;
Oskarsson et al., 2009), there are systematic biases in
people’s conception of randomness, such as the gambler’s
fallacy (Kahneman & Tversky, 1972) and the hot hand
fallacy (Gilovich et al., 1985). One particular bias that has
received much attention in the past is the over-alternation
bias: a binary sequence that alternates more than expected
on the basis of random generation tends to be judged as
random (Bar-Hillel & Wagenaar, 1991; Falk & Konold,
1997; Lopes & Oden, 1987; Nickerson, 2002), and people
tend to produce random sequences that contain too many
alternations (Kahneman & Tversky, 1972; Wagenaar, 1972).
This bias is robust across different stimulus types, sensory
modalities, or presentation modes (Yu et al., in press).

A number of accounts have been proposed to explain the
over-alternation bias. One explanation focuses on the limits
of working memory (Baddeley, 1966; Kareev, 1992). Since
people can only hold a limited number of items in working
memory at any given time, the amount of bits being
processed is constrained, leading to a biased sample of
randomness (Hahn & Warren, 2009; Miller & Sanjuro,
2015; Yu et al., in press). Another prominent account of the
over-alternation bias is the idea of local representativeness,
which suggests that people assume equal frequency of
outcomes within a local sequence (Tversky & Kahneman,
1971). A recent account is offered by Falk and Konold
(1997) who proposed an encoding hypothesis that states that
the probability that a bit sequence is labelled random varies
directly with the time needed to correctly memorize or copy
it. However, this account has been challenged by recent
work showing a discrepancy between encoding difficulty of
the binary sequence and labeling the sequence as random
(Zhao et al., 2014). While these explanations have offered
valuable insights, there remains a possibility that people
have an accurate view of randomness, but the cognitive
limitations contribute to a biased conception of randomness
(Rapoport & Budescu, 1992).

The current study
We explore a new explanation focusing on a perceptual
limitation in the ability to represent alternations vs.
repetitions. If alternations are under-represented compared
to repetitions, there needs to be more alternations in the
sequence in order for people to perceive a 50% alternation
rate that is typically assumed in a random sequence.
In order to generate a binary sequence that contains
different levels of alternations while maintaining the equal
probability of outcomes, we used an algorithm that deviates
from stochastic independence by allowing previous bit to
influence the next one. Specifically, for each p in the unit
interval (from 0 to 1), let D(p) generate a sequence of bits
consisting of zeros and ones as follows:

3609

A fair coin toss determines the 1st bit. Suppose that the nth bit
(for n≥1) has been constructed. Then with probability p the
n + 1st bit is set equal to the opposite of the nth bit; with
probability 1 − p the n + 1st bit is set equal to the nth bit.
Repeat this process to generate a sequence of any length.

This procedure was first introduced by Zhao, Hahn, and
Osherson (2014). D(.5) is a genuinely random device. For
p<.5, D(p) tends to repeat itself, resulting in long streaks,
whereas for p>.5, D(p) tends to alternate. The expected
proportion of each bit is 50% for all p∈[0, 1], although
empirically, the output might deviate from 50%; however
such deviations should be small and random (Yu et al., in
press). For any sequence produced by D(p), the expected
proportion of alternation, called the “switch rate” of the
generating process, is p. The expected proportion of
repetitions, called the generating “repeat rate”, is 1 – p.
We conducted four experiments to examine how people
represent alternations vs. repetitions. In Experiment 1,
participants viewed a binary sequence and estimated the
number of switches or repeats in the sequence. In
Experiment 2, participants viewed a binary sequence and
recalled the sequence. In Experiment 3, participants viewed
two sequences and judged whether the sequences were the
same or different. In Experiment 4, participants searched for
a target embedded in a binary sequence.

Experiment 1
This experiment examined if there are differences in the
estimation of alternation vs. repetition in binary sequences.

Participants
Forty-five undergraduate students (32 female, mean
age=19.9 years, SD=2.3) from the University of British
Columbia (UBC) participated for course credit. Participants
in all experiments provided informed consent. All
experiments reported here have been approved by the UBC
Behavioral Research Ethics Board. We conducted a power
analysis using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner,
2007), which showed that given an effect size of 0.53 (based
on our prior work, Zhao & Yu, 2016), a minimum of 38
participants would be required to have 95% power to detect
the effect in our design.

Stimuli
In each trial, participants viewed a 30-bit sequence. Each
sequence contained circles of two colors: green (RGB: 0
255 0) and blue (RGB: 0 0 255). Each circle subtended 0.9°
in diameter (Figure 1a). There were five levels of switch
rates in D(p) in generating the sequences, where p = 0.1,
0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9. Correspondingly, there were five
levels of repeat rates (1 – p) = 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1.
Temporal sequences. For half of the trials, participants
viewed a temporal sequence where the 30 circles were
presented one after another, making simple visual grouping
impossible. Each circle was presented at the center of the
screen for 100ms, and the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was
100ms with a blank screen (Figure 1a).
Spatial sequences. For the other half of the trials,
participants viewed a spatial sequence, where the 30 circles
were presented on the screen simultaneously. The circles
were presented left to right. The space between two adjacent

circles in the sequence subtended 0.1°. Each sequence was
presented on the screen for 1000ms (Figure 1a).

Procedure
There were 200 trials in total for each participant. In each
trial, participants viewed a sequence with one of the five
generating switch rates (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9). Each level
of switch rate contained 40 trials, among which 20 trials
were temporal sequences and 20 trials were spatial
sequences. After viewing the 30-bit sequence, participants
were asked to estimate either the number of the color
switches (10 trials), or the number of color repeats (10
trials). Specifically, the instruction for estimating color
switches was “How many times did a dot have a
DIFFERENT color from the previous dot in the sequence?”
and the instruction for estimating color repeats was “How
many times did a dot have the SAME color as the previous
dot in the sequence?”. Participants were also told that the
range of their estimate was from 0 to 29 (29 was the
maximum possible number of switches or repeats in the
sequence). Participants typed in their estimate after seeing
each sequence. In sum, there were three within-subjects
factors: the generating switch rate of the sequence (from 0.1
to 0.9), the presentation of the sequence (temporal vs.
spatial), and the estimation type (switches vs. repeats). The
order of the trials was randomized for each participant.
There was no mention of randomness in all experiments.

Results and Discussion
Estimated switch rate was the derived by dividing the
estimated number of switches from the participants by 29
(the maximum possible switches in the sequence). Likewise,
estimated repeat rate was calculated by dividing the
estimated number of repeats from the participants by 29 (the
maximum possible repeats in the sequence). Observed
switch rate was the objective switch rate in the sequence
presented to the participants in each trial. Likewise,
observed repeat rate was the objective repeat rate in the
sequence presented in each trial. The generating switch rate
was the p in D(p) in the algorithm that generated the
sequence. The generating repeat rate was 1 – p. To verify
that the presented sequence actually exhibited the generating
switch rate or repeat rate, we plotted the observed switch
rate or repeat rate for each sequence (Figure 1 b to e), which
mapped closely to the generating switch rate or repeat rate.
We computed the signed error (estimated – observed
switch rate or repeat rate) at each of the five generating
levels. For temporal trials (Figure 1 b and d), a 5 (generating
rate: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) × 2 (estimation type:
switches vs. repeats) repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a
main effect of generating rate [F(4,176)=162.3, p<.001,
ηp2=0.79] and of estimation type [F(1,44)=49.34, p<.001,
ηp2=0.53], and a reliable interaction [F(4,176)=10.75,
p<.001, ηp2=0.20]. Pair-wise comparisons at each generating
rate showed that participants underestimated the number of
switches more than repeats at each of the five generating
rates [p’s<.01]. For spatial trials (Figure 1 c and e), the same

3610

ANOVA revealed a main effect of generating rate
[F(4,176)=107.2, p<.001, ηp2=0.71] and of estimation type
[F(1,44)=114.2, p<.001, ηp2=0.72], but no interaction
[F(4,176)=0.07, p=.99, ηp2<0.01]. Again, pair-wise
comparisons at each generating rate showed that participants
underestimated the number of switches more than repeats at
each of the five generating rates [p’s<.001].

This perceptual insensitivity to switches may underlie the
conceptual over-alternation bias of randomness. Taken
together, these results suggest that alternations in a binary
sequence were under-represented compared to repetitions.

Experiment 2
One explanation for the under-estimation of switches could
involve working memory. Specifically, people may have
trouble representing switches accurately in memory,
mistaking them for repeating bits, thus leading to underestimation. To examine this possibility, here participants
were asked to recall each sequence.

Participants
Forty-five students (30 female, mean age=19.6 years,
SD=1.2) from UBC participated for course credit.

Stimuli and Procedure

Figure 1. Experiment 1. (a) Participants (N=45) were presented
with temporal or spatial sequences, and estimated either the
number of circles that had a different color from the previous circle
(switch) or the number of circles that had the same color as the
previous one (repeat). (b) The estimated switch rate and the
observed switch rate were plotted for temporal trials. (c) The
estimated switch rate and the observed switch rate were plotted for
spatial trials. (d) The estimated repeat rate and the observed repeat
rate were plotted for temporal trials. (e) The estimated repeat rate
and the observed repeat rate were plotted for spatial trials. (Error
bars reflect ±1 SEM; *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p<.001)

We further compared the estimated switch or repeat rate
with the observed switch or repeat rate. For temporal trials
(Figure 1b), participants over-estimated the switch rate at
0.1 and 0.3, but under-estimated the switch rate at 0.5, 0.7,
and 0.9. They also over-estimated the repeat rate at 0.1 and
0.3, but under-estimated the repeat rate at 0.7 and 0.9
(Figure 1d). For spatial trials (Figure 1c), participants overestimated the switch rate only at 0.1, and under-estimated
the switch rate at 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9. They over-estimated
the repeat rate at 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5, but under-estimated the
repeat rate at 0.7 and 0.9 (Figure 1e).
Interestingly, when estimating the number of repeats,
participants were the most accurate around 0.5 where the
sequences were truly random. For the same random
sequence, participants were significantly under-estimating
the number of switches. In fact, for people to perceive a 0.5
switch rate, the sequence must contain more than 50%
switches, with a switch rate of around 0.7 (Figure 1 b and c).

The stimuli were the same as those in Experiment 1, except
for these differences: there were 10 circles per sequence to
circumvent a floor effect in the recall task; each circle was
slightly larger, subtending 1.4°in diameter, and the distance
between each circle in spatial sequences was 0.2°; and each
spatial sequence was presented for 500ms (Figure 2a).
The procedure was identical to Experiment 1, except for
one difference: after seeing each sequence, participants were
asked to recall the sequence as accurately as they could, by
pressing two keys to produce the green circle (the “G” key)
or the blue circle (the “B” key). Participants were instructed
to recall the dots in the same order as they appeared. After
each key press, the corresponding circle was presented on
the screen for 100ms, and then disappeared. To recall the
spatial sequence, participants pressed one key and the
corresponding circle appeared from left to right on the
screen, and remained on the screen.

Results and Discussion
Since the observed switch rate of the sequences mapped
closely onto the generating switch rates (Experiment 1), for
all following experiments task performance was plotted
against the five generating switch rates.
To assess the accuracy of participants’ recalled sequences,
we divided the exact matches between the presented
sequence and the recalled sequence by 10. The accuracy
was plotted over the five levels of switch rates. For temporal
trials (Figure 2b), a one way repeated-measures ANOVA
revealed a significant difference in accuracy across the five
switch rates [F(4,176)=75.61, p<.001, ηp2=0.63]. Post-hoc
Tukey HSD analysis showed all pair-wise comparisons were
significant except between 0.7 and 0.9, and 0.5 and 0.9. For
spatial trials (Figure 2c), accuracy was different across the
switch rates [F(4,176)=111.5, p<.001, ηp2=0.72], and posthoc Tukey HSD analysis showed that all pair-wise
comparisons were significant except between 0.7 and 0.9.
These results demonstrate that as the switch rate of the
sequence increased, recall accuracy decreased.

3611

To obtain a more fine-grained analysis, from the second
bit on, we calculated the recall accuracy of each bit
depending on whether the bit repeated or switched from the
previous bit. We compared the recall accuracy of switching
versus repeating bits. For temporal trials (Figure 2d), a 5
(generating rate: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) × 2 (bit type:
repeating vs. switching) repeated-measures ANOVA
showed a main effect of generating rate [F(4,176)= 75.61,
p<.001, ηp2=0.63] and of bit type [F(1,44)=206.7, p<.001,
ηp2=0.82], and a reliable interaction [F(4,176)=37.4, p<.001,
ηp2=0.46]. Pair-wise comparisons at each generating rate
showed that the recall accuracy of repeating bits was
consistently higher than that of switching bits [p’s<.01]. For
spatial trials (Figure 2e), the same ANOVA showed a main
effect of generating rate [F(4,176)= 111.5, p<.001,
ηp2=0.46] and of bit type [F(1,44)=28.84, p<.001, ηp2=0.40],
and a reliable interaction [F(4,176)=7.18, p<.001, ηp2=0.14].
Pair-wise comparisons at each generating rate showed that
the recall accuracy of repeating bits was higher than that of
switching bits [p’s<.001] at switch rates 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5.

sequences for temporal trials (f) and spatial trials (g). (Error bars
reflect ±1 SEM; *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p<.001)

One problem with the accuracy measure based on exact
matches was that it penalizes cases where participants
reversed or misplaced bits but were nonetheless accurate. To
circumvent this problem, we conducted another analysis
where we calculated the switch rate of the recalled
sequence, and compared that to the observed switch rate of
the presented sequence (Figure 2 f and g).
We computed signed error (switch rate of the recalled
sequences – observed switch rate) separately for temporal
and spatial trials. For temporal trials (Figure 2f), a one way
repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant
difference in signed error across the five generating switch
rates [F(4,176)=140.7, p<.001, ηp2=0.76]. Post-hoc Tukey
HSD analysis showed all pair-wise comparisons were
significant except between 0.1 and 0.3, and 0.1 and 0.5,
suggesting that errors were greater at higher switch rates.
For spatial trials (Figure 2g), the same ANOVA revealed a
significant difference in signed error across the five switch
rates [F(4,176)=92.54, p<.001, ηp2=0.68]. Post-hoc Tukey
HSD analysis showed all pair-wise comparisons were
significant except between 0.1 and 0.3, and 0.1 and 0.5,
suggesting errors were greater at higher switch rates.
These results showed that as the sequence alternated
more, recall accuracy diminished. The greater recall error in
switching bits compared to repeating bits suggests that
people are more likely to encode switches as repeats, than to
encode repeats as switches.

Experiment 3
What explains the encoding difficulty of switching bits?
One explanation is that switching bits may be less salient
than repeating bits. To examine salience, Experiment 3 used
a change detection task where participants detected changes
in two sequences that were presented one after another.

Participants
Forty-five students (24 female, mean age=20.6 years,
SD=1.8) from UBC participated for course credit.

Stimuli and Procedure

Figure 2. Experiment 2. (a) Participants (N=45) were presented
with 10-bit temporal or spatial sequences, and recalled the
sequences. Accuracy was calculated as the proportion of exact
matches between the presented sequence and the recalled sequence
for temporal trials (b) and spatial trials (c). From the second bit on
in each sequence, recall accuracy of each bit was calculated
depending on whether the bit repeated the previous bit, or switched
from the previous bit, for temporal sequences (d) and spatial
sequences (e). We also calculated the switch rate of the recalled
sequences, plotted with observed switch rate of the presented

There were 200 trials in total. In each trial, participants were
presented with two back-to-back sequences of 15 green and
blue circles (Figure 3a). The color and size of the circles
were identical to those used in Experiment 2. The sequences
were generated with one of the five switch rates (0.1 to 0.9)
as before. There were 40 trials per switch rate, 20 of which
contained a change where the color of one randomly
selected circle was different between the two sequences, and
20 of which contained no change where the two sequences
were the same. In each trial, all circles in the first sequence
were presented simultaneously at the center of the screen for
500ms, with an ISI of 500ms, followed by the second
sequence also presented for 500ms. Participants had to
judge whether the two sequences were the same or different

3612

by pressing the “Y” key or the “N” key, respectively. The
trials were presented in a random order.

Experiment 4
To provide further support for the salience account,
Experiment 4 used a visual search task to measure attention
to switching vs. repeating sequences.

Results and Discussion
To examine the performance of the change detection task,
we calculated A’ by dividing the average of correct rejection
rate and correct hit rate by two, then adding 0.5 to the
resultant number (Pollack & Noman, 1964). A’ was plotted
across the five generating switch rates (Figure 3b). There
was a reliable difference in A’ across the five rates
[F(4,176)=24.64, p<.001, ηp2=0.38]. Post-hoc Tukey HSD
analysis showed all pair-wise comparisons were significant
except for between 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9.

Participants
Forty-five students (33 female, mean age=19.6 years,
SD=2.1) from UBC participated for course credit.

Stimuli and Procedure
As in Experiment 3, there were 200 trials, and in each trial,
a sequence containing 15 colored circles were presented
simultaneously on the screen. As before, the sequences were
generated with one of the five switch rates, and there were
40 trials per switch rate. For each trial, participants had to
search for a target (a red arrow pointing left “<” or right
“>”) in one of the randomly selected circles in the sequence.
They were asked to identify the direction at which the arrow
was pointing as fast and as accurately as they could (Figure
4a). Half of the trials contained an arrow pointing left, and
the other half contained an arrow pointing right. Each
sequence was presented for 1500ms. The trials were
presented in a random order.

Figure 3. Experiment 3. (a) Participants (N=45) viewed two
back-to-back sequences, and judged if the two sequences were the
same or different. (b) Performance was assessed using A’. (c)
Trials with changes were categorized into three change groups: 1.
repeats to switches, 2. switches to repeats, and 3. switches to
switches. (Error bars reflect ±1 SEM; ***p<.001)

We also examined change detection accuracy depending
on the local environment where the change occurred. For all
change trials, we categorized them into three groups: repeats
to switches (e.g., 000 to 001, 010, or 100), switches to
repeats (e.g., 010, 001, or 100 to 000), and switches to
switches (e.g., 001 to 011 or 101, 010 to 110 or 011, 100 to
101 or 110). Since we only considered trials where a change
occurred, there was no false alarm. Therefore, we used
accuracy as the measure here (Figure 3c). Among the three
types changes, there was a reliable difference in accuracy
[F(2,88)=55.95, p<.001, ηp2=0.56]. Post-hoc Tukey HSD
analysis showed that accuracy in the repeats to switches
group was reliably higher than that in the switches to repeats
and switches to switches groups [p’s<.001].
These results showed that as the sequence became more
alternating, a change in the sequence was harder to detect.
This suggests that repetitions were more salient than
alternations. Moreover, a change was more salient when a
streak was interrupted, than when an alternating pattern
became streaky or remained alternating. This differential
performance suggests that people may have paid more
attention to the streak presented in the first sequence, than to
the switches presented in the first sequence.

Figure 4. Experiment 4. (a) Participants viewed 15-bit spatial
sequences. The target was a small red arrow, pointing to the left or
right, in one of the circles. Participants reported the direction of the
arrow as fast and as accurately as they could. (b) Response time of
correct trials was plotted. (Error bars reflect ±1 SEM)

Results and Discussion
The accuracy of the target search task was high
(mean=97.5%, SD=2%). Thus, we only examined the
response times of correct trials as our measure of attention
(Figure 4b). There was a reliable difference in response time
across the five switch rates [F(4,176)=2.55, p<.05,
ηp2=0.05]. Post-hoc Tukey HSD analysis showed a reliable
difference in response times only between switch rates 0.1
and 0.5. This result showed that participants were faster to
find the target in sequences with more repetitions than with
more switches. One explanation is that repeating sequences
may draw attention more strongly than switching sequences.

General Discussion
The goal of the current study was to examine how people
represent alternations vs. repetitions in a binary sequence.
Across four experiments using estimation, working
memory, change detection, and visual search tasks, we
found that the number of alternations was under-estimated
more strongly than the number of repetitions (Experiment
1). This under-estimation of switches could be explained by
the fact that recall accuracy diminished as the sequence
became more alternating (Experiment 2). The greater
encoding difficulty of alternations could be explained by the
finding that changes were harder to detect as the sequence
became more alternating (Experiment 3). Finally, visual
targets were slower to be found as the sequence became
more alternating, suggesting that alternating sequences draw
attention less strongly than repeating sequences (Experiment
4). Overall, these results converge to support the same
finding that people are more blind or insensitive to
alternations than to repetitions, which suggests that
alternations are under-represented compared to repetitions.
The current findings support a new account on the overalternation bias. Specifically, there is a perceptual limitation
in the ability to accurately represent alternations as opposed
to repetitions in a binary sequence. This means that for
people to perceive a 0.5 switch rate, the sequence must
contain more than 50% alternations (in fact around 70%).
Why are alternations under-represented compared to
repetitions? We offer two explanations. First, two
alternating bits (e.g., 10) may be perceptually more complex
than two repeating bits (e.g., 11), and this higher complexity
in an alternation could be more difficult to encode. Second,
people may implicitly chunk an alternation into a unit (e.g.,
perceiving 101010 as three chunks of 10, Zhao & Yu,
2016), but rely on numerosity perception for repetitions
(e.g., perceiving 111111 as 1 repeating five times).
The current study reveals a perceptual limitation in the
representation of alternations. The study is important in
several ways: first, it provides a new explanation of the
over-alternation bias in randomness perception; second, it
reveals new insights on the limits in the perception of binary
information; and finally, the same finding was replicated in
four different paradigms using different measures. The
current findings shed light on how people process binary
information, which is fundamental to understanding the
limits of the cognitive system.
