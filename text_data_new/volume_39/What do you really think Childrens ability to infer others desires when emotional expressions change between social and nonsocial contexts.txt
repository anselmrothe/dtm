Abstract
We investigate children’s ability to use social display rules to
infer agents’ otherwise under-determined desires. In
Experiment 1, seven-to-ten-year-olds saw a protagonist
express one emotional reaction to an event in front of her
social partner (the Social Context), and a different expression
behind her social partner’s back (the Nonsocial Context).
Children were able to use the expression in the Social Context
to infer the social partner’s desire and the expression in the
Nonsocial Context to infer the protagonist’s desire. This
ability increased between ages seven and ten (Experiment 1).
When task demands were reduced (Experiment 2), seven-toeight-year-olds, but not five-to-six-year-olds, succeeded.
These results suggest that although it is not easy for observers
to infer emotions masked by social display rules, changing
emotional expressions between social and non-social contexts
allow even children to recover not only the desire of the
person displaying the emotions, but also that of the audience.

state inference

Introduction
Young children can use emotional expressions to draw
inferences about both external events in the world (e.g.,
Berman, Chambers, & Graham, 2010; Feinman, Roberts,
Hsieh, Sawyer, & Swanson, 1992; Wu, Muentener, &
Schulz, 2015), and others’ internal mental states (e.g.,
Repacholi & Gopnik, 1997; Rieffe, Terwogt, & Cowan,
2005; Wellman, Phillips & Rodriguez, 2000; Wu & Schulz,
2017). However, because people sometimes go to great
lengths to disguise their true feelings, emotional expressions
can be misleading. When speaking in front of a large
audience, an adult will pretend to be calm, even if she is
nervous. When receiving an undesirable gift, a polite child
will pretend to be happy even if she is disappointed. As we
will review, a relatively large body of work has looked at
children’s understanding of social display rules and masked
emotions. Here however, we consider a feature of social
display rules that has been largely overlooked in prior work:
they may disguise an individual’s feelings while being
informative about the feelings of her social partner’s. When
someone congratulates a friend in public but fumes in
private, we learn not only that this person’s true feelings
about the event are negative, but also that her friend’s true
feelings are probably positive. Thus, masked emotions may
reveal (about social partner’s) as much as they conceal
(about the individual herself). Given evidence about
someone’s feelings in both social and non-social contexts,
an observer might therefore recover information both about

the individual’s mental states, and those of the society she
keeps.
This kind of inference is non-trivial: it requires tracking
someone’s emotional expressions across social and nonsocial contexts, reasoning recursively about the mental
states of at least two parties. To our knowledge, despite
abundant work on emotion understanding and theory of
mind in early childhood (see Wellman, 2014 for review), no
one has yet looked at whether children can use real and
apparent emotions to infer not only the true feelings of the
person expressing the emotions but also of their intended
audience. That is our goal here.
First however, we note that there is a long line of work on
children’s ability to understand others’ real and apparent
emotions and their ability to respect display rules in their
own behavior. Research suggests that young children
modulate both their verbal and nonverbal responses in social
contexts (Cole, 1986; Saarni, 1984; Talwar & Lee, 2002;
Talwar, Murphy, & Lee, 2007; Xu, Bao, Fu, Talwar, & Lee,
2010). If for instance, an experimenter has lipstick on her
nose and asks a child how she looks, children as young as
three lie and tell her that she looks okay (Talwar & Lee,
2002). By three and four, children (in the laboratory
anyhow) inhibit their negative emotional responses to an
undesirable gift in front of a gift giver (Cole, 1986). As
children get older, they are more likely to lie for pro-social
purposes than for self-protective purposes (Xu, Bao, Fu,
Talwar, & Lee, 2010), and some evidence suggests that girls
are better than boys at regulating their verbal and nonverbal
behaviors (Cole, 1986; Davis, 1995; Saarni, 1984).
Between ages three and ten, children also show an
increasing ability to understand others’ masked emotions in
social contexts. When predicting a recipient’s response to an
undesirable gift, children invoke both verbal display rules
(e.g., judging that the recipient will tell a white lie) and
facial display rules (e.g., judging that she will express
happiness rather than disappointment; Broomfield,
Robinson, & Robinson, 2002; see also Gnepp & Hess,
1986). Children appear to understand verbal display rules
earlier than facial display rules (Broomfield, Robinson, &
Robinson, 2002), and are better at understanding display
rules for pro-social purposes than for self-protective
purposes (Gnepp & Hess, 1986; but see Misailidi, 2006).
The latter may be influenced by family emotional climates.
For example, negative expressiveness in a family
environment correlates positively with children’s
understanding of self-protective display rules and negatively
with their understanding of pro-social display rules (Jones,
Abbey, & Cumberland, 1998). Additionally, some

1363

researchers (Banerjee, 2002; Banerjee & Yuill, 1999a,
1999b; Naito & Seki, 2009) argue that the understanding of
social display rules relies on an ability to represent secondorder mental state information. In support of this, children’s
performance on a second-order false belief task predicts
their understanding of self-protective display rules
(Banerjee & Yuill, 1999b) and a more recent study suggests
that it predicts both their understanding of self-protective
and pro-social display rules (Naito & Seki, 2009).
Although fruitful, much of this literature has used tasks
with very rich contextual information (Banerjee, 1997;
Harris, Donnelly, Guz, Pitt-Watson, 1986; Misailidi, 2006;
Josephs, 1994; Wellman & Liu, 2004; Naito & Seki, 2009;
Gross & Harris, 1988). This is especially true for studies
involving very young children. For example, in Banerjee’s
study (1997), preschoolers were read stories including an
eliciting event (e.g., “Michelle is sleeping over at her
cousin’s house but she forgot her favorite teddy bear at
home”), an agent’s mental state (i.e., “Michelle is really sad
that she forgot her teddy bear”), an intention to hide the
agent’s true feeling (i.e., “Michelle doesn’t want her cousin
to see how sad she is”), and a reason for hiding that feeling
(i.e., “because her cousin will call her a baby”). Children
were then asked about what the agent really feels and what
she will try to look on her face. In such contexts, children
may succeed without going much beyond the information
available in the stories.
Consistent with this concern, studies using less
informative contexts have found that an understanding of
masked emotion and social display rules emerges much later
in development (Broomfield, Robinson, & Robinson, 2002;
Gnepp & Hess, 1986; Jones, Abbey, & Cumberland, 1998).
For instance, Gnepp & Hess (1986) provided children (first,
third, fifth, and tenth graders) with an eliciting event and an
agent’s mental state but did not explicitly mention the
agent’s intention to hide her feelings or any reason for her
doing so. Children failed to predict the use of verbal display
rules until third grade. Even adolescents (who successfully
predicted the use of verbal display rules) frequently failed to
predict that the agents would try to regulate their facial
expressions. However, with less information in the stories,
there is more uncertainty about whether the protagonist
intended to be polite or not; children may have preferred to
predict the emotional expression that directly mapped onto
the protagonist’s true mental state.
Thus, there remains some ambiguity about what children
understand, and when, about masked emotions. Rich
detailed scenarios may overestimate children’s ability to
understand social display rules, while less informative
scenarios may be open to interpretations that do not involve
social display rules at all.
More critically for the present purposes, previous work
does not ask whether children can recover information, not
only about the person displaying the emotion, but also about
the person who is the intended audience of the emotion. To
test this, we introduce children to a simple context where
one of two teams wins a game. An observer of the game

displays one of two emotional reactions (happy or sad) in
front of a social partner and the contrasting emotional
expression (sad or happy) behind the social partner’s back.
We ask children both the desire of the person expressing the
emotion, and that of his social partner. Since abundant work
suggests that even infants and toddlers understand that
someone whose desires are fulfilled will be happy and that
someone whose desires are thwarted will be sad (see e.g.,
Skerry & Spelke, 2014; Stein & Levine, 1989; Wellman &
Woolley, 1990; Yuill, 1984), we took it for granted that by
middle childhood, children could make this inference. The
critical question was whether children could recover each
participant’s true desires given that one person (henceforth
the Protagonist) displayed contradictory emotions in the
social and non-social contexts, and the other person
(henceforth the Social Partner) never displayed any emotion
at all. (Not only do children not see the social partner’s face,
they have no other source of information about his emotions
or desires. Thus the only way they can infer the social
partner’s desires is by using the protagonist’s display of a
false, misleading emotion in his presence. Given that
without considerable scaffolding, children only appear to
understand masked emotion relatively late in development
(e.g., Broomfield et al., 2002; Gnepp & Hess, 1986; Jones et
al., 1998), in Experiment 1 we test seven- to ten-year-olds.
In Experiment 2, we reduce the task demands and test fiveto eight-year-olds. In both cases, we look at whether
children can use the emotional expression in the nonsocial
context to infer the protagonist’s desire and the emotional
expression in the social context to infer the social partner’s
desire.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants Thirty-two children (M = 8.8 years; range:
7.2-10.8; 56% girls) were recruited from an urban children’s
museum. To ensure a balanced distribution across ages,
children were recruited in age bins consisting of 16 sevenand eight-year-olds (M = 7.9 years; range: 7.2-8.8; 63%
girls) and 16 nine- and ten-year-olds (M = 9.8 years; range:
9.0-10.8; 50% girls). While most of the children were white
and middle class, a range of ethnicities and socioeconomic
backgrounds reflecting the diversity of the local population
(47% European American, 24% African American, 9%
Asian, 17% Latino, 4% two or more races) and the museum
population (29% of museum attendees receive free or
discounted admission) were represented throughout.
Materials Each child saw two illustrated stories, one
presenting the Happy-Sad condition (e.g., Tom was happy
in front of Bryan but sad behind Bryan’s back) and the other
presenting the Sad-Happy condition. The facial expressions
were from istock photos (http://www.istockphoto.com/) and
have been used by previous research (Wu & Schulz, 2017).
The mapping between stories and conditions, and the order
of conditions were counterbalanced across participants,
resulting in a total of 4 storybooks. Different agents and

1364

games were used in each storybook (Tom, Bryan, and
basketball in one story and Sally, Diana, and volleyball in
the other).
Procedure Children were tested individually; all sessions
were videotaped. Children were asked check questions to
encourage them to follow along. Incorrect responses were
corrected throughout. Children had little difficulty with the
check questions. Check questions were used only to
maintain children’s attention; they were not analyzed or
used as inclusion criteria.
Each story was read consecutively, as follows (using the
basketball-game story as an example). The experimenter
placed the first picture on the table and said, “There is a
basketball game today. It’s the Tiger team against the Lion
team.” She introduced the next picture and said, “This is
Tom. Tom is a basketball fan. He loves watching basketball
games. He goes to watch the game. He is either a fan of the
Tiger team, or the Lion team, but we don’t know which
one.” Children were asked (Check question 1): “Do we
know which team Tom is a fan of?” The experimenter
introduced the third picture and said, “This is Bryan. Bryan
was Tom’s friend when they were little, but now they don’t
get to see each other very much. Bryan becomes a
basketball player. He plays in the game. He either plays for
the Tiger team or the Lion team, but we don’t know which
one.” Children were asked (Check question 2): “Do we
know which team Bryan plays for?” The experimenter
introduced the fourth picture and said, “The result of the
game was that the Tiger team won, and the Lion team lost.”
Then the experimenter introduced the fifth picture and said,
“After the game, Bryan ran back to the locker room. Tom
was passing by and saw Bryan. It was a very noisy and
crowded room and they didn’t have a chance to talk.
However, in front of Bryan, when Tom came passing by,
Tom made a face like this.” Children were asked (Check
question 3): “Did Tom look happy or sad?” The
experimenter introduced the sixth picture and said,
“However, behind Bryan’s back, as soon as Bryan passed
by and couldn’t see Tom, Tom made another face.”
Children were asked (Check question 4): “Did Tom look
happy or sad?” We controlled for the complexity between
the social and nonsocial contexts by having two people in
both contexts; the difference was only that in the social
context, they were facing towards each other, and in the
nonsocial context, they were facing away from each other.
(See Figure 1.)
Finally, the experimenter asked two test questions. The
first question was about the protagonist (Protagonist
Question): “Now I am going to ask you some questions. In
front of Bryan, Tom looked [happy/sad] but behind Bryan’s
back, Tom looked [sad/happy]. Do you think Tom is a fan
of the Tiger team or Lion team?” The experimenter then
asked the other test question (Social Partner Question):
“Does Bryan play for the Tiger team or the Lion team?”1

These two questions, although indirect assays of the agents’
desires, were selected as being more natural to the context. To

Coding We scored children’s responses separately for the
Protagonist and the Social Partner. Children received one
point for answering a question correctly and none for
answering it incorrectly.

Results and discussion
Participants performed equally well in the Happy-Sad and
Sad-Happy conditions (protagonist: X2 = .59, p = .442;
social partner: X2 = .00, p = 1.00). Additionally, there was
no order effect between the first and second stories
(protagonist: X2 = .07, p = .798; social partner: X2 = .00, p =
1.00). Thus, we collapsed children’s scores across the two
conditions. This resulted in a score of 0-2 for the
Protagonist and a score of 0-2 for the Social Partner.
Using age as a continuous variable, we found that
children between ages seven and ten showed an increasing
ability to use the emotional expression in the nonsocial
context to reason about the protagonist’s desire (β = .75, SE
= .36, z = 2.11, p = 0.035; Ordinal Logistic Regression), and

Overall, there was a non-significant trend for children to

children successfully recovered the social partner’s desire (z

we performed a planned median split on age. Five- and sixyear-olds did not perform above chance in either question

seven and eight, children can use changing emotional
expressions between social and nonsocial contexts to
recover the desires of both participants in a social exchange,
even when one participant is masking her emotions and the
only cue to the other participant’s desires is that misleading,
masked emotional reaction.

General Discussion
In two experiments, we investigated children’s ability to use
the information embedded in social display rules to recover
others’ otherwise under-determined mental states. Children
saw an emotional expression when a protagonist was in
front of a social partner, and a different expression when the
protagonist was behind the social partner’s back. Children
successfully used the expression in the nonsocial context to
infer the protagonist’s desire, and the expression in the
social context to infer the social partner’s desire. Children’s
ability to draw these inferences improved between ages five
and eight.
Our study builds on many previous studies that have
looked at children’s ability to predict an agent’s real and
apparent emotions given rich mental state information (e.g.,
the agent’s desires, true feelings, her intentions, and a
motivation to hide her true feelings; Banerjee, 1997; Harris,
Donnelly, Guz, Pitt-Watson, 1986; Misailidi, 2006; Josephs,
1994; Wellman & Liu, 2004; Naito & Seki, 2009; Gross &
Harris, 1988; Gnepp & Hess, 1986; Broomfield, Robinson,
& Robinson, 2002; Jones, Abbey, & Cumberland, 1998). In
contrast, here we provided children with very minimal
background information, and no direct information about
the agent’s mental states. Children’s ability to use the social
context to recover the desires of an agent who provided two
contradictory emotional reactions to an event, and also the
desire of a social partner, whose emotional expressions were
never observed at all, is consistent with other studies finding
that children can recover rich unobserved information from
observed emotional cues (e.g., Berman, Chambers, &
Graham, 2010; Feinman, Roberts, Hsieh, Sawyer, &
Swanson, 1992; Wu, Muentener, & Schulz, 2015; Repacholi
& Gopnik, 1997; Rieffe, Terwogt, & Cowan, 2005;
Wellman, Philips & Rodriguez, 2000; Wu & Schulz, 2017).
However, our study goes beyond those studies in suggesting
that children can also detect and understand the conditions
in which real emotions are masked.
Although emotional expressions are misleading when
people mask their true feelings, our results indicate that the

masking behavior itself (if detected) can be richly
informative. Note that feigning an emotional expression in
front of others reflects one’s beliefs and desires about
others’ beliefs or desires. Thus when a feigned emotional
expression is detected, it contains recursive mental state
information about what one agent thinks about what another
agent thinks. Although there has been debate on the extent
to which reasoning about pro-social display rules requires
second-order mental state representation (Banerjee, 2002;
Banerjee & Yuill, 1999a, 1999b; Naito & Seki, 2009), in
our task, the social partner’s beliefs, desires, and emotions
were unknown throughout. To recover information about
the social partner, children had to refer to the protagonist
and selectively use the protagonist’s emotional expressions
to gain insight into the mind of his audience. We suggest
that this kind of inference does require recursive mental
state reasoning, and the current results suggest that the
ability to make these inferences develops over middle
childhood.
Critically, children succeeded here in a very tightly
constrained context: there were only two possible outcomes
(one of two teams won a game), two possible emotional
responses (happy or sad) and two social partners.
Moreover, the task design virtually eliminated any memory
demands: children did not need to track the changing
emotional expressions over time; they were all concurrently
displayed in the storybook card format, together with the
social context. Future work might look at children’s ability
to draw comparable inferences when they must track
changing emotional dynamics over time and in more
complex, multi-participant scenarios. Note however, that
although more realistic scenarios may add processing
demands and complexity, they may also provide children
with richer cues to agents’ mental states.
The current results however, suggest that by age seven,
children can recover underlying mental states from changes
between real and apparent emotional expressions.
Intriguingly, the current results also suggest that there is a
limit to how much we can hide when we hide our feelings:
in disguising our true feelings, we may reveal what we think
about what other people want.
