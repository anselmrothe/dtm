Abstract
Child-directed speech (CDS) is a talking style adopted by
caregivers when they talk to toddlers (Snow, 1995). We
consider the role of distributional semantic features of CDS
in language acquisition. We view semantic structure as a
manifold on which words lie. We compare the semantic
structure of verbs in CDS to the semantic structure of child
speech (CS) and adult-directed speech (ADS) by measuring
how easy it is to align the manifolds. We find that it is easier
to align verbs in CS to CDS than to align CS to ADS,
suggesting that the semantic structure of CDS is reflected in
child productions. We also find, by measuring verbs vertex
degrees in a semantic graph, that a mixed initialized set of
verbs with high degrees and medium degrees has the best
performance among all alignments, suggesting that both
semantic generality and diversity may be important for
developing semantic representations.

Introduction
One of the biggest puzzles in cognitive science is how
children learn language from language input, namely childdirected speech. Child-directed speech is characterized by
simplified sentence structures, restricted vocabulary,
exaggerated intonation, and hyperarticulation, and previous
work has proposed that these features facilitate language
acquisition (Golinkoff and Alioto, 1995; Snow, 1995;
Thiessen, Hill, and Saffran, 2005). Here, we compare the
semantic spaces of child speech, child-directed speech and
adult-directed speech, spanned by verbs, using state-of-theart computational tools.
The contributions of this paper are both theoretical and
methodological. Theoretically, we explore various proposals
about roles of verbs meanings in CDS, represented using a
state-of-the-art
distributional
semantics
approach.
Distributional methods map each word to a point in highdimensional space so that words with similar meanings are
near each other. We view the semantic structure of the
vocabulary as a high-dimensional surface in this space, called
a manifold, and compare manifolds estimated from CDS to
manifolds estimated from child speech (CS) and adultdirected speech (ADS). Young children often broaden the use

of nouns and verbs and we model such differences in word
meaning as a mismatch of data points in a semantic space.
Methodologically, we adapt a novel semi-supervised
manifold alignment algorithm to compare semantic spaces
(Ham et al, 2005), which maps two manifolds into a common
subspace to measure the similarity of these manifolds. This
algorithm takes as input a subset of initial points that must be
aligned (i.e., pairs of points, one on each manifold, that
correspond to the same verb), and produces an alignment for
the rest of the verbs. We then measure the similarity of the
manifolds in terms of the accuracy of the alignment: how
often a verb is mapped to the same region of the common
subspace.
We find that alignment between the CS and CDS is more
accurate than the alignment between CS and ADS.
Additionally, we obtain more accurate alignments when
using verbs with many nearest neighbors (which have
broader meanings) as the initial points than verbs with few
near neighbors. Together, these results indicate that the
semantic structure of CS reflects the semantic structure of
CDS, and verbs with broad meanings may provide useful
cues to children in acquiring the overall semantic structure of
verbs. On the one hand, what children can learn from CDS
deviates semantically from unfamiliar conversations in ADS,
which suggests that further learning is required. On the other
hand, caregivers might align their semantic spaces to
children’s semantic spaces, which lies within the general
framework of conversational alignment (Pickering & Garod,
2004).

Model Setting
We combine models from two different traditions into a
general framework of semantic representation. To compare
the semantic spaces of CS, CDS and ADS, we use a manifoldbased algorithm. The similarities between semantic spaces
are measured by how easy it is to map one semantic space to
another. We represent the meaning of each verb by using the
global vector model (Pennington, Socher & Manning, 2014)
to embed words into a 50-dimensional space, which we call
a semantic space. . Following the associationist tradition in
psychology (Anderson, 1973), we represent the meaning
structure of the verbal lexicon as a whole by considering how
a collection of verbs is situated in this space, as expressed by
a neighborhood graph (Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005).

Estimating verb meanings from different datasets produces
different semantic spaces, and we compare the spaces using
a semisupervised manifold alignment algorithm (Ham et al.,
2005). This algorithm maps verbal semantic graphs into a
common semantic space and discovers the data point
correspondences by finding pairs of points with the smallest
Euclidean distances.

graph W is defined in Equation (2). D is the degree matrix, a
diagonal matrix with vertex degrees on the diagonal.
𝐿 =𝑊−𝐷

We use a symmetric graph Laplacian normalized by vertex
degree (Shi & Malik, 2000), as
𝐿𝑠𝑦𝑚 = 𝐷 −1⁄2 𝐿𝐷 −1⁄2 = 𝐼 − 𝐷 −1⁄2 𝑊𝐷 1⁄2

Lexical Semantic Representation
The past three decades saw efforts to model the mental
representation of concepts (Launder & Dumais, 1997). The
inspiration for recent computational work on lexical
semantics dates back to Harris’s (1954) hypothesis that
synonymous words appear in similar contexts.
One of the most successful semantic representation models
is proposed by Launder & Dumais (1997), known as Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA), which uses word-context cooccurrence matrices
to produce a low-dimensional
representation by singular value decomposition. The lexical
semantic representation model used in this paper is based on
a state-of-the-art algorithm, GloVe (Pennington, Socher &
Manning, 2014), which is an extension of LSA. Instead of
explicitly decomposing a word-context co-occurrence
matrix, GloVe implicitly decomposes a word-context logfrequency matrix. GloVe uses a weighted regression
objective function to reconstruct a log word-context count
matrix log( X ) with bias terms, as shown in Equation (1),
where w and b are bias vectors, X is the co-occurrence matrix
and f is a heuristic weighting function. The optimization
problem is iteratively solved using AdaGrad (Duchi, Hazan
& Singer, 2011).
𝐽 = ∑𝑉𝑖,𝑗=1 𝑓(𝑋𝑖𝑗 )(𝑤𝑖𝑇 𝑤
̃𝑗 + 𝑏𝑖 + 𝑏̃𝑗 − log𝑋𝑖𝑗 )2

Even though GloVe has better performance than traditional
singular-value-decomposition-based LSA, careful analysis of
the objective function suggests that GloVe is fundamentally
probabilistic matrix factorizations (Levy & Goldberg, 2014).

Aligning Semantic Spaces
We compare the semantic spaces of CS, CDS and ADS using
the semisupervised manifold alignment algorithm. A
manifold is defined as a topological structure with every local
point with a neighborhood similar to a Euclidean space. The
goal of the manifold alignment algorithm is to pair up data
points from two high-dimensional data sets. For example, the
algorithm aims to match give in CS to give in CDS. A
semisupervised algorithm, using both labeled and unlabeled
data as input, combines the strength of supervised and
unsupervised learning. The general goal of manifold
alignment is to map two high-dimensional data sets to a
common low-dimensional space simultaneously (Ham et al.,
2005), which essentially is an extension of manifold-based
nonlinear dimensionality reduction (Belkin & Niyogi, 2003).
Manifold-based methods are based on the geometric
assumption that data in high dimensional space lie in lowdimension manifolds.
Ham et al.'s algorithm defines a function f that maps the first
manifold to a common space, and a function g that maps the
second manifold to a common subspace. These functions
strike a tradeoff between mapping labeled pairs to the same
point in the common space, and respecting local structure on
the original manifolds as expressed by the graph
Laplacian Lx for the first space and Ly for the second space.
As we have both labeled (l) and unlabeled (u)
points, Lx and Ly are block matrices:
𝐿𝑥
𝐿𝑥 = [ 𝑥𝑙𝑢
𝐿𝑙𝑢

Semantic Graphs
The manifold alignment algorithm we use approximates the
underlying manifold by constructing a similarity graph G =
(V, E), where the vertex set V is the set of verbs and the edge
set E is a set of pairs of verbs that are near to each other. The
weight of an edge is set to the cosine similarity between the
verbs associated by the edge. The degree of a vertex is the
sum of weights of all the edges linking to the vertex. In
semantic networks, vertex degrees can be interpreted as
contextual diversity. There are several ways to build such a
similarity graph. Ozaki et al (2011) found that undirected
mutual k nearest neighbor (mkNN) graphs give good
performance for alignment of natural language data, so we
use mkNN graphs. An mkNN graph has an edge (𝑣1 , 𝑣2 ) if
either 𝑣1 or 𝑣2 is within the k nearest neighbors of the other.
We set k to 15 for the first experiment. In the second
experiment, we increase k to 20 to better investigate the
degree effects. The unnormalized graph Laplacian (L) of

where μ expresses the tradeoff between mapping points
exactly and preserving local structure on the original
manifolds. The first term is the sum of distances between
paired data points in the common space, and the second two
terms represent faithfulness to the graph Laplacian. Ham et
al. point out that Equation 4 is unsuitable for optimization,
since it ignores simultaneous scaling of f and g, and so
instead minimize the Rayleigh quotient:

𝐶(𝒇, 𝒈) = μ ∑𝑖 |𝑓𝑖 − 𝑔𝑖 |2 + 𝒇𝑇 𝐿𝑥 𝒇 + 𝒈𝑇 𝐿𝑦 𝒈 (6)
We set μ to positive infinity to impose a hard constraint
for labeled pairs to be mapped directly on top of each other.

The classes of verbs are the ones that appear in 3
constructions: the ditransitive (John gave Mary a book), the
locative (The man loaded hay onto a truck) and the conative
(The police shot at the criminal). Since CHILDES suffers
from data sparcity, verbs missing in either CS or CDS were
excluded from analysis. We end up with 811 data points for
CS, CDS and spoken COCA respectively.

Model Training

Experiment Setup
Corpora
The training set for CDS and CS is a combined data set from
CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000), which consists of all the
data on American English-speaking monolingual 3 to 7 yearold children with typical language and cognitive
development, excluding diary studies. To simplify data
collection, only utterances annotated as child are considered
child speech and only utterances annotated as mother and
father are considered as child-directed speech. The CS and
CDS corpora contain 5 million and 9 million word tokens,
respectively. To prevent the CS from being similar to CDS
purely due to priming effects, we divided the data into two
halves so that the CDS and CS data were not drawn from the
same contexts
Our ADS data is drawn from the spoken portion of the
Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA, Davies,
2008). Although this data may differ from more casual
conversations, it provides a large amount of spontaneous
speech in the form of unscripted conversations from 150
television and radio programs.

Materials

Global Vector Training We used the implementation of
GloVe from the Stanford NLP website to train 50dimensional vectors for each of our three datasets
(Pennington, Socher & Manning, 2014). We trained each set
of vectors for 50 epochs with a context window size of 10,
used a frequency cut-off of 2 for the CS and CDS datasets
and a cut-off of 10 for the ADS dataset.
Similarity Graph Construction We construct mkNN
graphs consistently throughout this paper. In the first
simulations, we fix the number of mutual nearest neighbors
to 15. In the second simulation, we test the effect of vertex
degrees and we set the number of mutual nearest neighbors
to 20 to increase the range of vertex degree.
Manifold Alignment The parameters that we need to
specify in the manifold alignment module include the initial
labeled alignments and the dimensionality of the manifold.
In addition to the number of labeled data, the identity of the
labeled data can also influence the quality of alignment. The
dimensionality of the manifold controls the abstraction of
semantic information contained in the word vectors. The
lower the dimension, the more abstract the representation.

Evaluation
Because the alignment algorithm pairs up labeled data points
exactly, we only evaluate alignments on unlabeled data. We
use a random alignment averaged over 5 times as the baseline
condition. Ideally, corresponding data points from two data
sets should be mutual nearest neighbor in the lower
dimensional space. We relax the evaluation requirements by
giving every alignment a k-nearest neighborhood evaluation
radius. If one data point is one of the k-nearest neighbors of
the corresponding point, we take it as a hit. When the
evaluation neighborhood radius equals 1, the measures
quantify the exact alignment.

The target words used in this model are all verbs, which are
understudied in the literature. We included the first 100
English verbs acquired by infants (Fenson et al., 1994), the

Simulation 1: Mapping CS to CDS and COCA
In this section, we demonstrate that CS-CDS alignment is a
less demanding task than CS-COCA alignment even when
potential priming effects from linguistic and non-linguistic
contexts are removed. We also predict that with the increase
of labeled data, the alignment accuracy also increases.

Method
We performed verb semantic graph alignments of CS to CDS
and to ADS for alignment spaces of dimensionality from 5 to
30. The unlabeled precisions are evaluated by the windowsize at 1 and at 20, as demonstrated in the contour heat maps
in Figure 1. The colors of different areas in the contours
indicate different levels of unlabeled accuracy and the data
points with the same unlabeled accuracy are connected by the
isolines in the maps.

interpretations for this result. First, the result can be viewed
as an imitation effect in which children mirror child-directed
speech semantically. Second, adult caregivers might adapt
their mental representations to children’s when they talk to
children, which sits well with the conversational alignment
theory (Pickering & Garrod, 2004). The big semantic gap
between initial language input and adult-to-adult
conversations on TV shows or radios suggests that learning
from CDS alone is not sufficient for real world language
processing. Adapting to TV or radio conversations constitute
one part of further learning, which supports a continuous
theory of language development.

Simulation 2: Semantic generality
In Simulation 2, we use a fixed list of labeled data to
investigate the effect of initialization in alignment, instead of
random initialization. The motivation is that language
scientists argue for the importance of a few important “pathbreaking” word exemplars in language learning (Ninio, 1999;
Goldberg, Casenhiser & Sethuraman, 2004). Some words
attract more vertices than others, which is known as
preferential attachment in network growth (Steyvers &
Tenenbaum, 2005). We evaluate the proposal that
semantically general verbs are better starting points for
language learning than semantically specific verbs, by
measuring the vertex degrees.

Results
The general trend is that the highest unlabeled precisions are
found in the upper right corners of the contour maps whereas
the lowest unlabeled precisions tend to lie close to the x-axis.
The dimensionality of the embedding space can be
interpreted as the granularity of children’s representations.
The result of the alignments is demonstrated graphically in
Figures 1 and 2. In the alignments from CS to CDS and CS
to COCA, the CS-COCA alignment achieves only 50% to
60% of the unlabeled precision of the CS-CDS alignment.
The unlabeled precision of the CS-CDS alignment is
consistently higher than the unlabeled precision of the CSCOCA alignment across all conditions. Both alignments have
much larger unlabeled accuracy than the random baseline.
The CS data are aligned to both the spoken COCA and
CDS corpora. The CS-CDS alignment precision wins over
the CS-COCA precision across all conditions. In other words,
child speech is much easier to map to child-directed speech
than to spoken COCA. This easier alignment can be
interpreted as similarity in semantic spaces across corpora.
Since the CS and the CDS word vectors are trained on
speech data from different experiments, the relative similarity
between CS and CDS lexical semantics, this similarity does
not reflect mere priming effects. There are two possible

alignments with a random alignment as the baseline
The degree of a vertex measures the association between a
vertex and its neighboring vertices. The prediction is that
vertices with large degree are better labeled data than vertices
with small degree. Cognitively, the verbs with high degree
are semantically general verbs whereas the verbs with low
degree are the ones with less general meanings.

Method
Verbs are ranked based on their vertex degree in a semantic
network. As shown in Table 1, what we use as labeled data is
100 verbs with the largest degrees, 100 with the smallest
degrees, and medium-degree verbs with degree rank of 201

to 300. We also mixed half of high degree verbs with half of
medium degree verbs in the mixed condition. The baseline
condition is averaged over 5 random initializations. We set
the number of mutual nearest neighbors, the evaluation
radius and the dimensionality all to 20.

verbs help in general, verbs that are semantically too general
may not be that helpful.

Results
The alignment precisions shown in Figure 3 show a clear
advantage of high-degree and medium degree conditions
over the low degree condition, but both high-degree and lowdegree have below random performances. We can also see an
advantage of medium degree initialization, which is parallel
to the basic level categorization theories. When we use a
mixed set of high-degree and medium-degree verbs, we get
the best results on all the conditions, which suggests that a
diverse-degree initialization facilitates semantic space
alignment.

General Discussion
In Simulation 1, we demonstrate that CS has semantic
properties very similar to CDS in comparison to ADS. This
result supports a usage-based approach to language
acquisition: children imitate their caregivers. The results can
be interpreted in multiple perspectives. First, the result
suggests that child speech is built upon restricted linguistic
contexts. One of the biggest characteristics of human memory
is context-dependency. Early language experience is built
upon restricted contexts and usages requires further learning
to achieve the adult form. Second, child-directed speech is
used in young children’s living environments. Children seem
to use words highly consistent with their caregivers. Third,
talking to children in child-directed speech is a double-edged
sword. On the one hand, children might have an easier time
initializing their language capacities at an early language
development stage because their hypothesis space is
restricted by child-directed speech. On the other hand, the
mismatch between child-directed speech and adult-directed
speech requires children to shift their semantic
representations at later development stages.
In Simulation 2, we show empirically that semantically
moderately general verbs are better starting points for
language development. Our simulations show mixed results
for the “path-breaking” argument that semantically generic
verbs are important for language learning (Ninio, 1999). Our
results suggest that both semantic generality and semantic
diversity play a role here. Although semantically general

In speech recognition and perception, speaker normalization
is the task of automatically adjusting to acoustic differences
between different speakers. Our work is inspired by Plummer
et al. (2010), who proposed manifold alignment as an account
for how young children learn to handle phonetic variability
in vowel production during language acquisition.
Aside from working with semantic, rather than acoustic,
representations, our work differs from theirs in two respects.
First, they used synthesized data as input, while we used
naturalistic corpus data. Second, since two token
pronunciations of vowels will never be the same, they
imposed only a soft alignment constraint that labeled pairs be
aligned, while we imposed a hard constraint.

Crosslinguistic Alignment of Polysemous Words
Youn et al. (2016) investigated semantic universals by
constructing networks of corresponding polysemous nouns
from 81 languages sampled from different language families.
Using an approach reminiscent of thesaurus-based synonym
induction, they established semantic correspondences
between nouns using bilingual dictionaries. The target
polysemous words were selected from the Swadesh 200 basic
vocabulary list. The procedure described in this paper is
automatic and takes into consideration the matching of
semantic spaces in one language, whereas Youn and
colleagues manually establishes semantic correspondences
for a few basic words in bilingual data.

Conclusions
The contribution of this paper is a novel integrated
framework that compares semantic spaces of children and
their caregivers based on naturalistic language productions.
We combined methods from three traditions, distributed
semantic representations, graph theory, and manifold

1161

alignment, into one framework for approaching the semantic
structure of the lexicon. We used naturalistic language
productions from CHILDES to compare the semantic spaces
spanned by verbs and demonstrated that (i) that CDS is more
similar to ADS than CS in terms the semantic spaces spanned
by verbs and that (ii) verbs with relatively large and diverse
degrees are especially useful for aligning semantic structures.
While the general computational framework proposed in
this paper does not provide an account of how children might
exploit this manifold-based and graph-theoretic information,
it does suggest that useful information about the structure of
the adult lexicon is available to children. Even though our
framework is on the computational level, using Marr’s
terminology (1982), it is very likely that semantic manifold
alignment plays a role in children’s semantic development.
Additionally, this framework may be of use to other fields
that are interested in the semantic structure of different
lexicons. For example, this approach may be useful for
performing
semantic
comparisons
between
languages or across time over the course of language
change, and understanding the semantic organization of
bilingual lexicons.
