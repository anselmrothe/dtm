Abstract

that it would suppress a competing value sample of 49. Here,
I focus exclusively on binary choices and show that this invariant mechanism fails to capture some qualitative patterns
in past data. To overcome this limitation, I propose a dynamical mechanism in which the inputs compete against each
other via potentially asymmetric inhibition.
In what follows, I describe the extant implementation of the
SI model and its trademark behavioural signatures. Then, I
use previously published data and outline qualitative patterns
that SI in its current form cannot explain. These patterns are
replicated in a new experiment. Third, I propose three extensions of the selective integration model and fit these extensions to the new data. Finally, I present results from a new
experiment that decisively disentangles these three selective
integration extensions.

When making decisions humans often violate the principles
of rational choice theory. Recent experiments, involving rapid
experiential decisions, uncovered a mechanism that is responsible for various rationality violations. According to this selective gating mechanism, incoming value samples are accumulated across time, but prior to their accumulation they are
weighted in proportion to their momentary rank-order. Here,
using a data-driven approach, I present a dynamic extension
of this mechanism, which involves potentially asymmetric inhibition between the inputs. As a result, and contrary to the
previous selective gating implementation, the vigour of gating
is modulated by the difference between two value samples (a
distance effect) as well as by the absolute magnitude of the
samples (a magnitude effect). This extension offers a superior explanation to existing and new data; and links high-level
decision phenomena with computational principles previously
described in theories of selective attention and visual search.

Selective Integration: description and
behavioural signatures

Introduction
Behaving organisms update their preferences in response to
changes in their internal status and the state of the world; but
they also do so in the absence of such changes. For instance,
people are found to prefer A (e.g., fresh fish) over B (e.g.,
steak), when these two alternatives are offered, but B over
A when a third – inferior and unchosen– alternative, C (e.g.,
frozen fish), becomes available (Huber, Payne, & Puto, 1982).
Reversals of preference, as in the example above violate the
axioms of rational choice theory (Von Neumann & Morgenstern, 2007) and indicate that the valuation of an alternative
is context-sensitive, not only dependent on the agreement between the goals of the decision-maker and the properties of
the judged alternative but also dependent on the properties of
other alternatives in the choice set.
Context-sensitive valuation (hereafter CSV) phenomena
are reported as preference reversals (Tsetsos, Usher, &
Chater, 2010) or transitivity violations (Tversky, 1969),
elicited in multiattribute choice experiments. Recently,
analogues of these CSV phenomena were obtained in a
rapid experiential decision task, labelled value psychophysics
(Tsetsos, Chater, & Usher, 2012; Tsetsos et al., 2016). Obtaining CSV phenomena in a psychophysical task enabled
the detailed computational modelling of the involved decision
processes, pointing to a selective integration model (hereafter
SI) that underlies several rationality violations.
According to SI, value information is accumulated across
time but, prior to accumulation, higher value samples suppress lower samples via a selective gating mechanism. In the
extant implementation of the model the vigour of this suppression is constant. For instance, a value sample of 60 will
suppress a competing value sample of 59 in the same fashion

In the SI model for binary choices, value samples in support
of the two alternatives arrive simultaneously 1 and are accumulated over time, as in sequential sampling models of perceptual discrimination and categorisation (Bogacz, Brown,
Moehlis, Holmes, & Cohen, 2006). Importantly, the values
that are momentarily higher are passed onto the accumulation layer unaffected but the relatively lower values are truncated, akin to an attentional process that selectively prioritises
the accumulation of local winners over local losers. In this
section I outline the mathematical details of the extant implementation of selective integration for binary choices and
point to key behavioural phenomena predicted by the model.

Model description
The model described here applies to decisions based on two
sequences of inputs, presented simultaneously. The two sequences have thus the same number of samples and each pair
of samples is presented at a discrete time-step, for a fixed time
interval. Here, based on the findings in Tsetsos et al. (2016), I
assume that the incoming samples are not corrupted by noise
prior to accumulation. The two sequences are labelled SA and
SB , with SA (t) indicating the value of sequence A at the (discrete) sample t. Two accumulators (YA and YB ) integrate the
values of the sequences across time according to the following difference equations:
1 It is suggested that the simultaneous processing of two competing samples emulates deliberation over two multiattribute options.
This analogy works under the assumtpion that, in real-life multiattribute choices and on each moment, one attribute is considered and
the corresponding attribute values serve as inputs into a preference
formation process (Tsetsos et al., 2012)

YA (t) = (1 − λ) ·YA (t − 1) + IA (t) + ξ · ζA (t)

YB (t) = (1 − λ) ·YB (t − 1) + IB (t) + ξ · ζB (t)

(2)

In the above t indicates the current discrete time-step (or
sample), λ is accumulation leakage, IA,B (t) is the input to
the two accumulators on a given time-step, ξ is the standard
deviation of the noise at the accumulation level and ζA,B (t)
are standard Gaussian samples, independent from each other
and across time-steps. The accumulators are initialised at 0:
YA (t) = YB (t) = 0. At the end of the accumulation period (at
t = T , with T being the total number of samples presented in
each sequence) a decision is made in favour of the accumulator with the higher tally. If both accumulators end up with
equal tallies, a decision is made randomly.
The inputs to the two accumulators (IA,B (t)) reflect the
modified sequence values after the selective integration filter
is applied. I refer to this filter as selective gating. Selective
gating is implemented as follows.
IA (t) = θ(SA (t), SB (t)) · SA (t)

(3)

IB (t) = θ(SB (t), SA (t)) · SB (t)

Function θ returns a value of 1 if the first argument is equal
or larger than the second and a value w (selective gating parameter) otherwise:

Behavioural signatures of selective integration
Pro variance (PV) effect. Consider two sequences, A and
B, with values sampled from normal distributions with means
µA , µB and standard deviations σA , σB . The pro variance effect (PV) occurs when participants choose more often sequence A when µA = µB and σA > σB . Equivalently, the
PV effect is present when accuracy is higher in trials where
µA > µB and σA > σB (correct answer is A) relative to the
accuracy in trials where the means are swapped (µA < µB
and σA > σB ; correct answer is B). The PV effect was originally demonstrated in Tsetsos et al. (2012) and it was robustly
replicated in Tsetsos et al. (2016). SI explains the PV effect
as follows: a losing sample from the high variance distribution will more likely have low value. In the low variance distribution, a losing sample will more likely have a mediocre
value. Multiplicatively downweighting a low value results
in a smaller loss relative to downweighting a mediocre value
(for a value of 30 and for w = 0.5 the loss is 15; for a value
of 50 the respective loss is 25)(Tsetsos et al., 2012).
Frequent-winner (FW) effect. Consider two sequences A
and B, consisting of the same three low (L), medium (M) and
high (H) value samples such that H − M = M − L. The order of appearance of these three samples differs in the two
sequences: A → LMH and B → HLM. Thus, when presented

simultaneously in that order, sequence A wins locally twice
by a small margin (M vs. L and H vs. M) and loses once
by a larger margin (L vs. H). According to the SI model
(w < 1) a choice bias in favour of sequence A is expected
since M + H + L · w > L · w + M · w + H or M > M · w. This
frequent-winner effect (hereafter FW) can also appear when
accuracy is higher in trials in which all values in A are augmented by a small constant c (such that A has a higher total
value and dominates B in 2 out of 3 samples), relative to the
accuracy in trials in which all values of B are augmented by
a small constant c (in that case B has a higher value but A
still dominates B in 2 out of 3 samples). Importantly, SI can
lead to intransitive preference cycles when a third sequence
C with values MHL is considered. In that case, in the respective binary choices, A will be preferred over B, B will be
preferred over C and C will be preferred over A. The FW effect, and the corresponding weak stochastic transitivity violations, were robustly obtained across 4 experiments, in which
participants had to choose between bars of different length,
presented sequentially (Tsetsos et al., 2016).

Challenges for Selective Integration
Under the selective integration framework the PV and FW
effects occur due to the same mechanism, controlled by the
selective gating parameter. It is therefore expected that the
two effects will be strongly correlated across participants.
However, a re-examination of the 4 experiments reported in
Tsetsos et al. (2016) (N = 93) reveals no correlation between
the two effects (r = 0.000). On the contrary, the effects predicted by fitting the SI model show indeed significant positive correlation (r = 0.323, p = 0.002). Additionally, for the
same parametrisation, the SI model predicts a much stronger
FW than PV effect (difference in the predicted effects: M =
0.128, SE = 0.014,t(92) = 9.150, p < 0.001). However, in
the observed data this difference does not occur (difference
in the observed effects: M = 0.006, SE = 0.023,t(92) =
0.240, p = 0.811). The model predicts well the magnitude of
the FW effect but, although the predicted PV effect is significant (M = 0.036, SE = 0.004,t(92) = 9.177, p < 0.001), it is
much smaller than the observed one (observed and predicted
difference for the PV effect: M = 0.102, SE = 0.014,t(92) =
7.274, p < 0.001).
The lack of correlation between the PV and FW effects
and the underestimation of the PV effect challenge the existing implementation of SI. It is conceivable, however, that
these patterns are specific to the design and stimuli used in
Tsetsos et al. (2016) (i.e. accumulation of lengths) and do
not reflect generalisable limitations of the model. I examine
next whether this is the case by characterising the PV and
FW effects in an experiment that involves the accumulation
of numerical values (c.f. Tsetsos et al. (2012)).

Experiment 1
Participants. 25 participants (Mage = 28.1, SDage = 6.4, 14
female) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no

1231

history of neurological or psychiatric impairment were recruited from Birkbeck’s (University of London) participants
pool. All participants gave informed consent to participated
and all procedures were approved by the local ethics committee.
Task & Procedure. On each trial, participants observed
pairs of black 2-digit numerical values presented rapidly and
sequentially, to the left and right of a central fixation point and
against gray background. The viewing distance was 60 cm
and each numerical character was 0.93◦ wide and 1.5◦ long.
After the presentation of 9 pairs of numbers, the central fixation point turned blue and participants were asked to choose
which stream had on average the higher value. After giving a
response the blue dot turned green (red) to indicate a correct
(incorrect) response. The presentation rate of the numbers
was 800 ms and 1 second gap was left between trials. Overall
there were 4 blocks with 65 trials each. At the end of each
block participants could see their accuracy so far. At the end
of the experiment participants received £7 and a £2 bonus if
their accuracy exceeded 75%.
Design. There were 4 types of trials (65 trials per type) in
the experiment, presented in random order. In all trials there
was a correct answer, with the sum of the higher sequence differing from the sum of the lower sequence by 72 units. Two
types of trials were associated with the PV effect while the
other two with the FW effect. In the PV trials the sequences
were generated from Gaussian distributions, with the mean
of the higher sequence (µH ) sampled from µH ∼ U(45, 65).
The mean of the lower sequence was µL = muh − 8. In one
type of PV trials, referred to as PV1 trials, the standard deviation of the higher sequence was σH = 20 while the standard
deviation of the lower sequence was σL = 10. In PV2 trials
the standard deviations changed with σH = 10 and σL = 20.
The accuracy difference between PV1 and PV2 trials quantifies the PV effect. In the FW trials, the mean values of the
higher and lower sequences were matched to those in the PV
trials. However, the temporal distribution of the sequences
was manipulated such that one alternative always dominated
the other in 6 out of 9 samples (see also Tsetsos et al. (2016)).
In FW1 trials the higher sequence dominated the lower sequence more often. When the higher sequence dominated, it
did so by U(23, 28) units and in the less often cases when
the lower sequence dominated it did so by U(22, 32) units.
In FW1 trials the higher sequence dominated the lower sequence in 3 out of 9 samples only. When the higher sequence
dominated it did so by U(38, 48) units and when the lower
sequence dominated it did so by U(7, 13) units. The accuracy
difference between FW1 and FW2 trials quantifies the FW effect. In all trials the generated sequences were constrained so
as to involve only 2-digit numbers ranging from 10 to 90.
Results. Participants performed above chance in all trials (accuracy: M = 0.774, SE = 0.023). Accuracy in PV1
trials was higher than in PV2 trials (M = 0.167, SE =
0.032,t(24) = 5.170, p < 0.001, d = 1.034 ) replicating thus

the PV effect obtained elsewhere (Tsetsos et al., 2012,
2016). Accuracy in FW1 trials was higher than in FW2 trials (M = 0.050, SE = 0.017,t(24) = 2.897, p = 0.008, d =
0.579). This finding replicates with different stimuli (i.e.
numbers) the effect reported in Tsetsos et al. (2016). Contrary to what SI predicts, there was no correlation between
the two effects (r = −0.014, p = 0.949) and the FW effect
was weaker than the PV effect.

Extensions of selective integration
The challenges that were identified for SI using the datasets
from Tsetsos et al. (2016) persist in Experiment 1: the two
critical effects were not correlated and the PV effect was
larger than the FW effect. To address these challenges I
here propose 3 extensions of the SI model. One extension
is static, with selective gating invariance as in the original
model, while the other two are dynamic and biologically inspired. The primary aim of these extensions is to decorrelate
the PV and FW effects. Hereafter, the baseline SI model described earlier will be referred to as MS0 .

A static extension
The first SI extension involves a transducer function that
transforms objective values into their subjective counterparts.
The model is thus identical to the one described in Eq. 1-5,
with the exception that Eq. 3-4 take the form:
IA (t) = θ(SA (t)α , SB (t)α ) · SA (t)α

(6)

α

(7)

α

α

IB (t) = θ(SB (t) , SA (t) ) · SB (t)

Exponentiating the inputs allows the PV effect to occur independent of the selective gating parameter when α > 1. In
such cases the value function is convex resulting in a riskseeking bias. Although convex low-level representation is
undocumented in numbers (Feigenson, Dehaene, & Spelke,
2004) or lengths (Stevens, 1957)), it is possible that, at a
higher processing level, large quantities stand out. This
model will be referred to as MS1 .

Dynamic extensions
Implementations MS0,1 are static in nature. Here I explore dynamical implementations, in which selective gating falls out
from continuous competition between the input units. The
competition is mediated by inhibition as in models of visual attention (Lee, Itti, Koch, & Braun, 1999). To illustrate the basic idea, the incoming values compete against each
other and the activation states of the input units feed continuously, in cascade (McClelland, 1979), to the accumulation
level (variables Y in Eq. 2). Almost equivalently, and to maintain comparability between static and dynamic SI implementations, I assume that a given accumulator receives discrete
updates. These updates are equal to the temporal average of
the activation in the corresponding input unit, for the period
during which the stimulus was presented. The first dynamic
model, labelled MD1 , involves mutual inhibition between the

Variables XA,B reflect the input units. Variable P is the duration (in units of time) that a given pair of samples is presented for and dx is a small time interval (set in simulations
to dx = 0.001 seconds). The input units are initiated at 0 and
their dynamics are governed by the following coupled differential equations:

dXA = (−κXA − β f (XB ) + SA (t))dx

(10)

dXB = (−κXB − β f (XA ) + SB (t))dx

(11)

(12)

XB = max(XB , 0)

(13)

When β = 0, the two input units quickly converge to their
nominal values. When inhibition is present, the larger value
suppresses the smaller value, implementing that way a form
of selective gating. Figure 1a shows examples of the evolution of activation states in the input units.
The second dynamic extension (MD2 ) is identical to MD1
with the exception that, following Brown and Holmes (2001),
each unit inhibits the other via a sigmoid activation function.Thus, f , which was the identity function in MD1 , now
becomes:
f (x) =

In the above, κ is a leak parameter (set to 1 throughout
this paper), f is the identity function ( f (x) = x) and β is the
strength of mutual inhibition. The two input units thus reflect sustained input, corresponding to the presented values,
SA,B (t) at time-step t. For simplicity, the above equations are
deterministic, consistent with the finding that during value
psychophysics noise at the representation level is negligible
(Tsetsos et al., 2016). The input units are subject to a reflecting boundary at 0 that prevents activation states from being
negative:

Comparison of selective integration extensions
Quantitative comparison of the models
Here I fit the models to the choice data of each participant from Experiment 1. Model predictions for each trial
are derived numerically. The negative log likelihood of
each parametrisation is calculated on a trial-by-trial basis
and summed across trials. MS0 has three free parameters
(w, ξ, λ) and MS1 has one extra free parameter (α). For the
dynamic extensions, some parameters are set to fixed values
(κ = 1, g = 1, P = 500ms, dx = 1ms), which leaves MD1 with
3 free parameters (σ, λ, β) and MD2 with a fourth parameter
(b). The models are compared based on their BIC values,
aggregated across participants, and also on a participant-byparticipant basis (i.e. the proportion of participants for which
a model has the lowest BIC score). Additionally, the correlation between the PV and FW predicted effects is examined.
The results are summarised in Table 1.

In the above, g is the slope of the activation function (here
set to 1) and b the inflection point of the sigmoid. In other
words, b controls when selective gating will kick in while
the inhibition strength (β) controls the strength of selective
gating. The difference between (MD1 ) and (MD2 ) is that, in
the former, inhibition is mutual while in the latter inhibition
can be non-reciprocal (Figure 1b) and inactive from inputs
of low value.

MD2 explains the data best and succeeds to decorrelate the
PV and FW effects (last column in Table 1). It is also the only
model that does not underestimate dramatically the PV effect
and predicts that it will have higher magnitude than the FW
effect (Figure 2). In this model, the PV effect is partly driven
by parameter b. If this parameter is set above the middle of
the value range, selective gating will be inactive for comparisons between mediocre and low values, further exaggerating

the choice bias for a high variance sequence. The FW effect
is independent of the b value (as long as it is not too high,
deactivating altogether selective gating). MS1 also succeeds
to decorrelate the effects but provides a poor fit. Importantly,
MD1 appears to suffer from the same limitation as MS0 : selective gating is controlled by one parameter (β) and the PV
and FW are strongly correlated.

Qualitative differences among models
The distinction between the four selective integration implementations is the way selective gating is implemented. In
the two static implementations (MS0,1 ) the weight applied on
the local loser is invariant to the difference between the winning and losing value samples. On the contrary, in the dynamic extensions, this difference matters. In Figure 3, I show
the effective weight applied on the losing sample for several
combinations of pairs of values (c.f. Figure 1). Static implementations predict, by definition, invariance of weighting
(here for w = 0.5). MD1,2 both predict that as the difference
between the two inputs increases (c.f. leftmost and middle
bars), suppression of the loser increases too. This is reminiscent of the distance effect encountered in numerical cognition
(Moyer & Landauer, 1967).
Adding a constant to both input samples (c.f. leftmost
and rightmost bars) results in opposing predictions in the two
dynamic models. MD1 predicts weaker suppression for increased values, since the competition between the two inputs
takes longer to resolve. MD2 predicts a stronger suppression
of the loser, since the winning unit will breach first the b barrier and will start inhibiting the other unit strongly, resulting
in enhanced winner-take-all dynamics (Figure 1, rightmost
panels). All models thus make distinctive qualitative predictions regarding a magnitude effect, which I exploit in the next
experiment.

In this experiment I examine how the PV effect changes when
all sequence values increase or decrease by the same constant
amount (Figure 4a). According to static models no change

is expected, since selective gating is invariant to the magnitude of the values. MD1 predicts weaker selective gating for
high values, while MD2 predicts a stronger PV effect for high
values.
Participants. 18 participants (Mage = 26.4, SDage = 5.2, 11
female) took part. The rest of details are as per Experiment 1.
Task & Procedure. The task and procedure was identical
to Experiment 1 except that there were 12 samples in each
stream and that the presentation rate was 0.5 seconds. Overall
participants did 6 blocks with 50 trials each.
Design. The PV effect was elicited as in Experiment 1, using two trial types ( PV1,2 ) and examining the accuracy difference between them. Here, there were 3 conditions giving rise
to 6 trial types (50 trials for each type, randomly presented).
In the baseline condition (PVB1,2 ), the correct sequence had
always a mean of 50 and the incorrect a mean of 42. In the
negative offset condition (PV−1,2 ), for a given trial, 6 pairs
of values were created as per the baseline condition. The remaining 6 pairs were created by subtracting from the mean
of both Gaussians a constant (c = 15). The regular and lower
pairs were presented in random order in a given trial. Equivalently, in the positive offset condition (PV+1,2 ) a constant
(c = 15) was added to the values of 6 pairs.
Results. The PV effect increased as both sequences increased in absolute values as indicated by a repeated measures ANOVA (F(2, 34) = 18.74, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.524).
Tukey post-hoc tests revealed that the PV effect was lower
in the negative offset condition relative to the baseline (p <
0.001) and the positive offset (p < 0.001) conditions. The
difference between the baseline and the positive offset condition was not significant (p = 0.171). As predicted, this PV
increasing pattern was solely captured by MD2 . The advan-

Conclusion
Selective integration is a decision making model that has successfully explained several rationality violations. One potential criticism against this model is that its applicability is
limited to rapid decisions from experience, in which attentional demands are increased. However, it has been previously shown that selective gating increases under lower attentional demands (Tsetsos et al., 2016). Additionally, behavioural signatures that are routinely obtained in high-level
decisions are also obtained in rapid experiential decisions,
implying that the latter can offer a window to more complex
choice mechanisms.
Here I presented challenges for the extant implementation
of selective integration. These challenges were successfully
addressed by a dynamic extension of the model, in which the
inputs compete for accumulation via inhibiting each other,
as in models of selective attention and visual search. This
dynamic extension predicts that the vigour of selective integration increases both when the distance and the absolute
magnitudes of the two inputs increase. This prediction was
experimentally confirmed. Oveall, this dynamic and biologically inspired (Usher & McClelland, 2001) extension presented here, significantly improves the descriptive adequacy
of the selective integration framework and facilitates its validation at the neurophysiological level.
