Abstract: According to a classic view of reasoning, intuition is fast but fallible, while reflection is slow but reliable. Biases,
therefore, emerge when a reasoner’s intuitions are wrong and they fail to notice. Recent evidence, however, suggests that
people may be aware when their intuitions are incorrect. A possible explanation reason for this is that both correct and incorrect
responses are cued in parallel, but the strongly-cued incorrect response is given unless people can inhibit it. We tested this
explanation using base rate neglect problems, and recorded participants’ mouse cursor movements as they chose between
possible answers under time pressure. Descriptions affected both participants’ early movements and ultimate responses, and
interfered with their use of the base rates, while base rates rarely interfered with participants’ use of descriptions, and then only
at a later point in time. Thus, despite suggestive findings elsewhere, our results support the classic of view reasoning.
