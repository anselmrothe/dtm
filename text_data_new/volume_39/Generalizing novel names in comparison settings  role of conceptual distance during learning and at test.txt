Abstract
In a comparison setting (two stimuli), we tested 4- and 6-yearold children’s generalization of novel names for objects. We
manipulated the semantic distance between the two learning
items (e.g., two bracelets versus a bracelet and a watch), and
the semantic distance between the learning items and the test
items (e.g., a pendant versus a bow tie). We tested whether
smaller semantic distance between learning items would lead
to more taxonomic (vs. perceptual) choices at test, than
broader semantic distance during learning, especially in the
case of distant test stimuli. Results revealed main effects of
learning distance, of generalization distance and that only
children aged 6 years benefited from broader semantic during
learning at test. Four year-old children failed to generalize to
far test stimuli even with semantically distant learning items.
We discuss how conceptual distance during learning
differentially affects generalization performance across age
groups.

Conceptual

Introduction
When learning novel concepts for objects, children have to
capture which object dimensions are important to define the
corresponding concept and neglect idiosyncratic aspects,
particularly irrelevant perceptual dimensions (e.g., Murphy,
2002, for a discussion). Indeed, in many cases perceptual
similarities (e.g., objects from different categories
displaying the same texture and/or the same color) or
differences are more salient than variations along the
relevant features.
Do children spontaneously generalize novel names
according to perceptual similarities such as shape
similarities or do they use deeper core knowledge? On one
hand, there is large evidence showing that children’s early
words refer to deep conceptual properties. This has been
shown in triad selection tasks, in which young children are
shown a standard object and are later asked to choose
between a categorically related object and a thematic match.
—“This [standard] is a dax. Can you find another dax?”.
Children usually select the categorically related object
(Markman, 1989, see Imai, Gentner, & Uchida 1994, for
evidence that children generalize on the basis of shape in
this paradigm). On the other hand, there is evidence that,
early in development, children often generalize object novel
names to perceptually similar objects, especially “shape-

similar objects” (Landau, Smith, & Jones, 1988; Smith,
Jones, & Landau, 1992).
In many cases, perceptual similarities between the
standard and the test object are conceptually irrelevant. It
has been shown that ignoring these salient irrelevant
perceptual similarities can be challenging for young children
(e.g., Augier & Thibaut, 2013; Gentner & Namy, 1999).
Hence, understanding what situations promote nonobvious
over salient properties is a crucial issue for cognitive science
and concept learning. There is now considerable evidence
that comparison learning situations promote generalization
based on deeper conceptual properties than classical
learning situations in which children are provided with only
one learning exemplar.
A large body of research in both children and adults shows
that comparison can highlight nonobvious shared properties.
For example, Gentner and Namy (1999) used pictures of
objects from familiar taxonomic categories (e.g. fruits) to
teach a novel name and tested 4-year-olds novel names
extensions to other referents. In a one-standard condition
(e.g. an apple introduced as a blicket) children preferred to
extend the new label to a perceptually similar object (e.g. a
balloon) rather than to a taxonomically-related-butperceptually-dissimilar object (e.g. a banana). This
preference was reversed when children had the opportunity
to compare two standards (e.g. an apple and an orange,
introduced as blickets).
The benefits of comparison have been demonstrated for
object names (e.g., Gentner & Namy, 1999; Augier &
Thibaut, 2013), adjectives (e.g., Waxman & Klibanoff,
2000), action verbs (e.g., Childers & Paik, 2009), names for
parts (Gentner, Loewenstein, & Hung, 2007), relational
nouns (Gentner, Anggoro, & Klibanoff, 2011; Thibaut &
Witt, 2015) and perceptual categories (e.g., Hammer,
Diesendruck, Weinshall, & Hochstein, 2009). Augier and
Thibaut (2013) also obtained this positive effect of
comparison with unfamiliar objects. Four- and 6-year-olds
were randomly assigned to a no-comparison (one object)
condition or to a comparison condition (two objects). In
both conditions, the same two posttest objects were used. In
the no-comparison condition, the standard – training - item
had the same texture but not the same shape as one of two
test objects. The standard also shared its shape but not its
texture with the other test object. In the comparison
condition, they pitted an unfamiliar test object displaying a
perceptually non-salient dimension (texture) that was shared

3314

with both training items against another unfamiliar object
that shared a perceptually salient dimension (shape) with
one of the two training standards only. In the no-comparison
condition, a majority of children extended the new label to
the same-shape test object. By contrast, in the comparison
condition, a majority of children extended the novel name to
the same-texture match rather than to a stimulus that had the
same shape as one of the two standards. Taken together,
these results show that comparison situations are a powerful
tool for conceptually-based rather than superficially based
novel name learning in children.
However, a growing body of research shows that
comparisons generate cognitive costs. Recent studies on
semantic analogies (Richland, Morrison, & Holyoak, 2006;
Thibaut, French, & Vezneva, 2010a) or perceptual analogies
(Thibaut, French, & Vezneva, 2010b) (see also Richland &
Burchinal, 2013) support this cognitive costs hypothesis. In
these studies, irrelevant perceptual features or semantic
distractors explained part of children’s performance. The
hypothesis was that these experimental conditions required
inhibition and flexibility. Thus, finding out nonobvious
relevant relations requires inhibiting superficial irrelevant
dimensions and integrating more difficult dimensions.
In this context, Augier and Thibaut (2013) manipulated
the number of items to-be-compared in 4-year-old and 6year-old children. According to the authors, introducing
more evidence in favor of the target dimension (texture) also
means more comparisons and more information to integrate,
generating more executive costs. They included age as a
factor. They hypothesized that the younger group might not
benefit from increasing the number of items in the same
way. Results showed that both groups benefited from the
two-standard condition. However, only the older group
benefited from an increased number of standards (four
standards versus two standards).
In the same executive control framework, Thibaut and
Witt (2015) studied relational categories with 42-month-old
children. Relational categories are defined by relations
between objects rather than by the intrinsic properties of the
objects involved in these relations (e.g., neighbor). In this
experiment, they used relational categories such as “the
knife is the dax for the apple” (Gentner, Anggoro, &
Klibanoff, 2011). They manipulated the number of pairs of
pictures of objects used in the training phase to illustrate a
relational category (2, 3 or 4 pairs such as an apple and a
knife for “the knife is the dax for the apple”) and the
distance between the domains depicting the relation. For
example, a knife with an apple and another knife with an
orange come from close domains whereas a knife with an
apple and a log with a saw come from more remote
conceptual domains. In the transfer phase, results revealed
that three learning pairs were better than two or four and
that learning pairs from remote domains were led to better
generalization than learning pairs from close domains.
These results suggest that increasing the quantity of relevant
information might interfere with young children’s ability to
abstract relevant dimensions in this type of task. More

generally, they suggest that there is an optimal number of
information that can be integrated in such comparison
situations. It is likely that this optimal number increases
with age. The distance between domain effect suggests that
a broader conceptual distance between learning exemplars
helped participants abstracting the relevant relation between
objects. A smaller distance between domains might have led
participants to constrain the semantic domains around very
similar entities (e.g., fruits) and similar operators (e.g.,
knifes).

Goals of the present experiment
We examined the effect of learning and transfer distance in
a comparison of real objects task (e.g., two apples, or two
fruits, see Gentner & Namy, 1999). Most former studies
with real object categories contrasted no-comparison and
comparison conditions. We will focus on comparison
conditions and study in which condition(s) comparison
leads to better conceptual generalization in a novel name
learning task. A closer look at the stimuli in former studies
reveals that the objects in the learning pairs come from
semantic domains the semantic distance of which is not well
controlled for. The same is true for the conceptually related
transfer item. In other words, the distance between semantic
domains in the learning items, and the distance between the
learning items and the transfer items (i.e. the conceptually
related target) has not been controlled as independent
variables. However, it can be argued that the “width” of
learning and generalization depends on the learning
exemplars. There is a large body of literature showing to
what extent generalization depends on the nature of the
training items (Son, Landy, & Goldstone, 2008), on the one
side, and factors affecting the generalization width on the
other side (e.g., Klahr & Chen, 2011). Thus, knowing at
which distance children generalize is a main issue in the
study of the ontogeny of categories, subordinate, basic, and
superordinate categories.
In the following experiment, we manipulated the semantic
distances between both the learning items and the test items
(in the generalization phase). Further, we compared two age
groups (4- and 6- year-olds) in order to study cognitive
resources might interact with these distances. Indeed,
children of different ages might not benefit from
comparison situations in the same way as a function of the
distance between learning instances and the distance
between learning and transfer instances. For example, it
might well be that both age groups would generalize
similarly in the close learning and close generalization case,
whereas younger participants might encounter more
difficulties to capture conceptual similarities in the case of
more distant learning items and or to apply them to more
distant domains.

Methods
Participants One hundred French speaking preschoolers
were tested individually in a quiet room at their school. Two
age groups were recruited. The younger group was

3315

composed of 48 children (mean age =4 years, 9 months; SD
= 6.7 months; range: 50 - 65 months) and the older group
was composed of 52 children (mean age = 6 years, 8
months, SD = 3.8 months, range: 74– 87 months) were
randomly assigned to one of the two experimental
conditions with 52 (close learning items) or 48 (far learning
items) children per condition. Informed consent was
obtained from their school and their parents.

choice was semantically close or more distant to the
learning items (e.g., a jewel pendant in the close
generalization case, or a bow tie in the far generalization
case). Figure 1 depicts the objects used to instantiate the
close and far learning distance and the close and far
generalization conditions for the "clothing accessories"
object category.
Table 1: List of items for the close and far conditions

Design Four and six-year-old children were compared. This
factor was crossed with learning distance (Close vs. Far
learning, between subject factor) and Generalization (Close
vs. Far generalization, within subject factor).
Materials Seven sets of six objects were created for each
distance condition (close or far) (See Table 1). Each picture
was displayed on a 8cm by 8cm piece of cardboard. Each
set corresponded to one category of objects (e.g., clothing
accessories, food, tools, etc.). The learning pair was
composed of one learning object and either a close training
object (close learning condition), or a more distant training
object (far learning condition) (see Figure 1). Thus, we

manipulated the conceptual distance between the two
training objects that were compared in each learning
condition (Close or Far) in our comparison paradigm. For
each object category (e.g., clothing accessories), the close
learning objects were composed of perceptually and
semantically close items (e.g., a bracelet - a curb chain),
while the far pairs were composed of perceptually similar
but conceptually more distant items (e.g., a bracelet – a
watch) (see Table 1). The two test pictures consisted of two
objects in both the close and the far generalization
conditions: an item that was perceptually similar but
semantically unrelated to the two training items (e.g., a tire
in our bracelet case) and a taxonomic choice. As a function
of the generalization condition, close or far, the taxonomic

Independent similarity ratings from 54 students confirmed
that the close learning object condition were conceptually
closer one to the other than the objects composing the far
learning pairs, t(26) = 3.98, p < .001, and that close
generalization stimuli were semantically more similar to the
two learning stimuli than far generalization stimuli, t(26) =
6.86, p < .001. For the purpose of our experiment it is
crucial that semantically related generalization items are
perceptually less similar to the learning items than the
perceptually similar lures. Perceptual similarity ratings
revealed that the perceptual choices were perceptually more
similar to the learning items than the semantically related
choices (taxonomic choices) in both the close and the far
conditions, t(26) = 14.03, p < .001 and t(26) = 18.49, p <
.001. Importantly, we also performed perceptual similarity
and conceptual similarity ratings between the close learning
stimuli (e.g., two apples) and the far learning stimuli (e.g.,
an apple and a cherry) on the one side and the taxonomically
related generalization item. They showed that overall the
generalization stimuli were equally distant to both types of
learning items. This was true for both types of
generalization items: close generalization items, perceptual
distance, t(26) = .70, p = .46, semantic distance, t(26) =
1.21, p = .41 ; far generalization: perceptual distance, t(26)
= .24, p = .65, semantic distance, t(26) = .43, p = .89. This

is central because we want to avoid that performance
differences between close and far generalization items to be
due to perceptual but also semantic similarity differences
between learning items. We included semantic similarity
differences in order to keep only taxonomic distance
influence. For example, if we get a difference between close
and far generalization items (e.g. between jewel pendent and
bow tie) we do not want it to be due to other semantic
information (e.g., the fact that the jewel pendent would be
more thematically related to bracelet than the bow tie) than
the taxonomic distance.
Each learning pair was randomly associated with one out
of 14 two-syllable novel names (e.g., youma, buxi, dajo,
zatu, sepon, xanto, vira, etc.) (see procedure).
Procedure
The experiment started with two practice trials. They were
followed by fourteen experimental trials presented in a
random order. Each standard learning stimulus was
introduced with a novel count noun (Landau, Smith &
Jones, 1988) (e.g. “this is a buxi” and “this is a buxi TOO”
for the other standard). A puppet named Yoshi was used in
order to make the task more attractive for children and to
make the use of non-words to refer to known objects more
meaningful with the following instructions: “In this game
we are going to learn the language of Yoshi. Yoshi is living
far away from here”. The objects were presented
sequentially and were left in view during the entire trial. The
two learning stimuli were presented in a row and their
location was determined randomly. The forced-choice test
phase was identical in all conditions. The two test objects
(i.e., the perceptual and the taxonomic matches) were
introduced and the child was asked to point to the one which
was also a member of the category (e.g., “Show me which
one of these two is ALSO a buxi”).
Results
We performed a 2 Age (4 vs. 6-year-olds) x 2 Training
distance (Close vs. Far distance) x 2 Generalization (Close
vs. Far) ANOVA on the percentage of taxonomic choices
(see Figure 2). Age and Training distance were betweensubject factors and Generalization a within-subject factor.
There were significantly more taxonomic choices in the Far
training condition (M = 64.4%; SD = 22.74) than in the
Close training condition (M = 51.3%; SD = 28.73), F(1, 96)
= 6.06, p = .016,
= .06 . The main effect of Age was not
significant, F (1, 96) = 1.14, p = .29,
= .01 (4-years: M =
54.9% ; 6-years: M = 60%) and Training distance did not
interact with Age, F < 1. In addition, children performed
better in the Close Generalization condition (M = 64.79%;
SD = 29.69) than in the Far Generalization condition (M =
51.4%; SD = 28.42), F(1, 96) = 29.79, p < .001,
= .24,
but the Generalization effect did not interact neither with
Age, F < 1, nor with Training distance, F < 1, and the triple
Generalization x Age x Training distance interaction effect
did not reach significance, F < 1.

When comparisons with chance were run, student-t tests
for independent groups with Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons revealed that children performed
above chance in the Close generalization condition, in the
Far learning condition only, (respectively, 4 years: t(23) =
3.49, p = .002; 6 years: t(25) = 6.82, p < .001) but not when
the learning items were conceptually close (respectively, 4
years: t(23) = 1.09, p = .28; 6 years: t(23) = 1.04, p = .30).
Interestingly, in the Far Generalization condition, only the
6-year-old children performed significantly above chance,
t(25) = 3.29, p < .0125, while the performance of the
younger children did not differ from chance, t(23) = .63, p =
.53.

Figure 2: Percentage of Taxonomic choices as a function of
the conceptual distance between during learning (close vs.
far learning distance) and at test (close vs. far
generalization). The error bars correspond to one standard
error and the dashed line represents chance level (50%).
Taken together these findings show a clear impact of
conceptual distance in our comparison framework, the Far
learning condition giving more taxonomic choices than the
Close learning condition. Our results also show that the
Close generalization is easier than the Far generalization
condition. Even though our results revealed no main effect
of Age effect and interaction of this factor with learning
distance, comparisons with chance confirm the beneficial
role of conceptual distance between the learning items and
suggested that in Far Generalization contexts only the older
children may benefit of comparison between conceptually
distant learning items.
Discussion
As mentioned in the introduction, there is a large body of
studies showing that young children generalize novel names
according to shape when only one standard stimulus is
introduced in the learning phase. Our study capitalized on
the idea that comparison situations during lexical learning
favor deeper generalizations based on less obvious features
that will, as a result, favor taxonomic generalization.
However, Augier and Thibaut (2013) showed that

3317

comparison situations generated cognitive costs that might
prevent younger children from using all the available
information. This result suggested that the effect of
comparison on generalization depends on the ease of
processing dimensional similarities and differences. Our
rationale was that the deep commonalities in close learning
items can easily be accessed because of many conceptual
commonalities. However, this situation might have provided
little information regarding conceptual similarities
subtending generalizations to broader categories. On the
contrary, comparisons between distant learning items may
be more difficult to unify conceptually because conceptual
similarities would be more difficult to abstract. By contrast,
comparisons might provide more abstract knowledge
supporting broader generalizations. Because younger
children might encounter more difficulties to capture
conceptual similarities in the case of distant learning items
and or to apply them to distant domains, we hypothesized
that conceptual distance during learning and at test might
differentially impact benefits of comparison across groups
of age. World knowledge might also contribute to the
difference between age groups, since older children have
more knowledge regarding the objects than younger
children.
Our results showed that both age groups benefited from
broader inter-item conceptual distance during the learning
phase since they perform better in the far learning case than
in the close one. However, close generalization was better
than the far generalization. Taken together, these two results
suggest that broader learning range lead to better close
generalization. The fact that only the older children
performed above chance in the far generalization condition
in the far learning case suggests a development from, first, a
better performance in the case of broad learning distance to,
second, a progressively better performance in the
generalization width. This last result suggests that if all age
groups were able to benefit from conceptual distance during
the learning phase, the benefit is probably qualitatively
different across age groups. We think that far learning
allowed both groups to defocus from perceptual similarities
and to access basic conceptual similarities ("is a jewel"),
while far learning would help older children to abstract
superordinate properties ("is a clothing accessory"), making
the former able to perform correct taxonomic choices only
in the close generalization condition ("the pendant is a jewel
too"), while the latter were able to generalize in the close as
well as in the far condition (" the pendant and the bow tie
are clothing accessories too").
Importantly, this pattern of results backs up the classical
result in developmental psychology that superordinate
categories are more difficult to learn than basic level
categories (Mervis & Rosch, 1981; Murphy, 2002) and
decomposes the sources of this difficulty. Children might
have more difficulties to generalize to broad categories
rather than to abstract from broad conceptual distances
during learning. Here, we used a perceptual lure. It should
be interesting to study how participants abstract categories

that are less grounded in perceptually similar instances of
the same category.
To conclude, our study suggests that making appropriate
use of comparison might entirely depends on tiny
differences along the properties of what is compared and on
executive capacity to process them. This finding has
important implication about the role comparison plays in
learning. Indeed, the executive constraints on comparison
processing might explain under which conditions
comparison can or cannot be fruitful.
