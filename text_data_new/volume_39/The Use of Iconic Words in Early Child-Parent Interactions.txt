Abstract

the duration of a sound and the visual extension of a line
(see Spence, 2011 for a review of crossmodal
correspondences). These biases, which may also be learned
by experience, might bootstrap children into the connection
between the sounds of iconic words and their corresponding
meanings (Imai & Kita, 2014; Perniss & Vigliocco, 2014).
The sound of a word could help children identify its
intended referent from a complex scene, recognize the
invariance of its meaning across contexts, and apply it
productively to new contexts. By helping children connect
spoken words with their meanings, iconicity may help
children gain the “referential insight” that speech sounds
refer to entities and properties in the world.

This paper examines the use of iconic words in early
conversations between children and caregivers. The
longitudinal data include a span of six observations of 35
children-parent dyads in the same semi-structured activity.
Our findings show that children’s speech initially has a high
proportion of iconic words, and over time, these words
become diluted by an increase of arbitrary words. Parents’
speech is also initially high in iconic words, with a decrease
in the proportion of iconic words over time – in this case
driven by the use of fewer iconic words. The level and
development of iconicity are related to individual differences
in the children’s cognitive skills. Our findings fit with the
hypothesis that iconicity facilitates early word learning and
may play an important role in learning to produce new words.

Laboratory studies of iconicity in word learning

Keywords: iconicity; vocabulary development; child-directed
speech; sound symbolism

Laboratory studies show that young children are indeed
sensitive to iconicity in spoken words, and some studies
suggest further that this iconicity can facilitate word
learning. Maurer et al. (2006) found that 2.5-year-old
children were more likely to match nonsense words
containing rounded vowels (e.g. bouba) with rounded
shapes, and words containing unrounded vowels (kiki) with
pointed shapes. Another study, using a preferential looking
paradigm, found that infants as young as four months are
sensitive to this bouba-kiki-type iconicity (Ozturk et al.,
2012). There is also evidence that sound-shape
correspondence can more directly facilitate word learning in
infants (Imai et al., 2015). 14-month-old infants were
habituated to combinations of a novel word and a picture of
an object, in either an iconically matching or mismatching
condition. When the children were then presented with the
novel words along with a picture of the correct object and a
distractor, they looked more at the correct object when its
sound and shape were matching.
The sensitivity of infants to sound-shape iconicity has
also been demonstrated using electroencephalography
(Asano et al., 2015). Event related potentials were measured
as 11-month-old infants were presented with pictures of
shapes followed by novel words that matched or
mismatched the shape in iconicity. With mismatching wordshape pairs, subjects showed a response similar to the N400
effect, typically an index of difficulty with semantic

Introduction
How do young children learn to understand and use their
first words? Philosophers have pointed out the inductive
challenge of learning to associate the sound of a word with
its meaning (Quine, 1960), and developmental psychologists
observe that this challenge is compounded for an infant
(Imai & Kita, 2014). Not only must infants isolate the
meaning of a word from a noisy, complex environment and
learn to generalize it to new contexts, they must grasp the
very concept of a symbol in the first place.
One cue infants may utilize to facilitate early word
learning is iconicity – a degree of resemblance between the
form of a signal and its meaning. For example, a person
might represent ‘small size’ with an index finger-to-thumb
pinching gesture, or in speech, by raising the pitch of their
voice as they articulate the small-sounding word “itty-bitty”.
One proposal for how iconicity can help early word learning
in spoken languages is the sound symbolism bootstrapping
hypothesis (Imai and Kita, 2014). (The term “sound
symbolism” is often used to refer to iconicity in spoken
words.) On this idea, children are biologically endowed with
a bias to recognize various cross-modal correspondences
between sound and phenomena of the other senses – for
example, between pitch and size or brightness, or between

integration. Analysis of brain oscillations found an increase
in early γ-band oscillations in the matching condition, which
might indicate increased cross-modal integration between
the sound of the word and its visual referent.
Importantly, children can benefit from iconicity in
learning to associate sounds and meanings in domains
outside of shape. Imai et al. (2008) presented 25-month-old
Japanese toddlers with novel words along with two video
clips of people performing two different manners of
walking. Norming with adult Japanese and English speakers
had determined that one of the videos, but not the other, was
iconically congruent with the verb. Similarly, when the
children were asked to select the manner of walking to
which they thought the word referred, they were more likely
to choose the one that matched the verb. A subsequent
experiment found that 3-year-old Japanese children were
able to correctly generalize the iconic verbs to new agents,
but were unable to generalize non-iconic verbs. Further
work replicated the finding with 3-year-old English learners,
indicating at least some level of universality in the iconicity
of the sound-referent pairings (Kantarzis et al., 2011). A
study by Yoshida (2012) found similar results with
Japanese- and English-speaking toddlers.

which systematically refers to negative or repellent
properties, but bears no clear resemblance to this meaning.
Yet, it is questioned whether spoken languages afford
sufficient articulatory freedom for words to be iconic but not
systematic. For instance, Monaghan et al. offers the example
of onomatopoeic words for the calls of small animals (e.g.
peep, cheep) compared to calls of big animals (roar, grrr),
which both iconically and systematically reflect the animals’
size. However, Perry et al.’s (2015) finding that the
iconicity-AoA relationship held after controlling for
systematicity shows some limited support for the
independence of these properties in English – at least for the
roughly 300 words for which these measures overlapped. In
further support for their independence, Winter et al. (in
press) examined the relationship between iconicity ratings
and Monaghan et al.’s systematicity index for 1,104 words,
and found only a weak correlation of r = 0.06.
Following the study of Perry et al. (2015), a couple of
subsequent studies have found comparable results. Massaro
and Perlman (2017) used the same procedure to collect new
iconicity ratings for the English MCDI words. They used
these to examine the relationship between iconicity and the
frequency with which children used the words from 6 to 47
months of age. The study found a gradual decrease in the
influence of iconicity on children’s production vocabulary
with increasing age. An analysis of children’s receptive and
productive vocabularies with respect to increasing
vocabulary size showed that the average iconicity of their
vocabulary declined with increasing size.
Massaro and Perlman (2017) observed that the very first
words that children produced were especially high in
iconicity and included a relatively high number of
onomatopoeic words. This observation is consistent with
some other studies of early vocabulary, which indicate that a
high proportion of children’s first words are onomatopoeic
or mimetic words. As reported by Laing (2015), a study of
children’s first five words across various languages found
that about 20% were onomatopoeic (Menn & Vihman,
2011). Another study found that 3-year-olds used more
mimetics to describe motion events than 5-year olds (Kita et
al., 2010).
In addition to the high level of iconicity in children’s
early spoken words, Perry et al. (in press) examined whether
parents use more iconic words in child-directed speech. The
study included iconicity ratings for approximately 2000
English words including Perry et al.’s (2015) prior ratings.
First, the study replicated the finding of a relationship
between the iconicity of words and their age of acquisition,
which was indexed by norms based on adults’ subjective
ratings (Kuperman et al., 2012). Second, the study examined
how iconicity influenced the frequency of words used in
children’s speech, as well as in the child-directed and adultdirected speech of adults. Word frequencies in childproduced and child-directed speech were calculated from
the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES),
and word frequencies of adult-adult speech were from the
American National Corpus. The results showed that younger

Iconicity in natural word learning
These laboratory studies show that young children are
sensitive to certain forms of iconicity in spoken words, and
under some conditions, they can learn iconic words faster
than non-iconic words. However, if iconicity does play an
important role in early word learning in the wild, then there
should be evidence of this in natural language learning. In
particular, children should learn more iconic words earlier,
and caregivers should be more inclined to use iconic words
with early learners.
A recent study of English and Spanish found that children
do tend to learn more iconic words earlier (Perry et al.,
2015). Perry et al. collected native speaker iconicity ratings
of roughly 600 English and Spanish words that are learned
earliest by children according to the respective MacArthurBates Developmental Inventories (MCDIs). They asked
participants to rate the degree to which the words “sound
like what they mean”. The age of acquisition (AoA) of
words was indexed by the proportion of children using the
word at 30 months according to the MCDI database. Over
multiple experiments in both languages, the results showed
that words rated as more iconic were acquired earlier by
children.
Notably, this relationship held after controlling for the
systematicity of words as measured by Monaghan et al.
(2014). Systematicity is an index of the degree to which
similar meanings have similar forms in the lexicon of a
language. Monaghan et al. found that, from the age of 2 to
13+ years, children tended to learn more systematic words
earlier. According to Monaghan et al., in theory, iconicity
and systematicity are orthogonal properties. Words can be
systematic but not iconic – a point they illustrate with the
English consonant cluster sl- (e.g. slime, slow, slur, slum),

914

children tended to use higher iconicity words more
frequently, but with age, they increasingly favored lower
iconicity words. Analyses of adult speech found that adults
used higher-iconicity words more frequently when talking to
children, but used lower iconicity words more frequently
with adults. Thus, as children became older and their
vocabulary grew in size, their speech became more adultlike in the use of iconic words.
The finding that parents used more iconic words in child
directed speech fits with some previous observations of
Japanese-speaking parents. Imai and Kita (2014) described
two studies published in Japanese that found that caretakers
used more mimetics and onomatopoeia with younger
children, but used these words less frequently as children
became more language proficient (Saji & Imai, 2013;
Suzuki, 2013). However, caution should be applied in
generalizing across languages: Japanese-speaking parents
have been shown to use more onomatopoeia and mimetics
than English speaking parents, who nevertheless do use
some onomatopoeia and especially sound effects (Fernald &
Morikawa, 1993; Yoshida, 2012).

2015; Winter et al., in press). Approximately 600 of the
words were selected from the MCDI (Fenson et al., 1994),
and additional words were chosen to maximize coverage
with relevant psycholinguistic datasets of age of acquisition
and concreteness norms. Complete methodological details
can be found in Perry et al. Native English speakers on
Amazon Mechanical Turk rated the iconicity of the words
on a scale from -5 to 5, where 5 indicated that a word was
highly iconic and sounds like what it means, -5 that it
sounds like the opposite of its meaning, and 0 that it is
completely arbitrary. The words “slurp” and “teeny” were
suggested as examples of highly iconic words, “cat” and
“dog” as arbitrary words (Pinker & Bloom, 1989), and
“whale” and “microorganism” as opposite-sounding words
(Hockett, 1960). Each word was rated by at least 10
participants. The average iconicity rating across all words
was 0.92 (SD = 1.13).
Systematicity measures were taken from Monaghan et al.
(2014). This study computed systematicity for a large set of
monosyllabic English words by measuring the overall
correlation between the degree of similarity between the
forms of any two words in the set, and the degree of
similarity between their corresponding meanings. Ratings
for individual words consisted of their contribution to the
overall form-meaning correlation across all the words.
Concreteness ratings were taken from Brysbaert et al.
(2014), which were collected for 40 thousand English words
and short phrases via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Words
were rated 1 ‘abstract’ to 5 ‘concrete’.

Current study
In the current study, we examined how the use of iconic
words in early conversations between children and
caregivers develops within individual children-parent dyads,
while controlling for production setting and individual
differences in the children’s verbal and nonverbal skills. The
longitudinal data include about six observations for each of
35 dyads within the same semi-structured activity across
children and ages. We examine the change in the use of
iconic words in children’s speech in comparison to the
speech of their parents, allowing us to investigate how
parents adapt their level of iconicity to their children’s
language proficiency. We also explore how individual
differences of the children (verbal and nonverbal IQ) relate
to the use of iconic words by children and parents over
development.

Speech data
The data were collected across six home visits, each
separated by 4 months. For six children, data at one visit
were missing. This generated a total of 204 visits. During
each visit, children engaged in a 30-min semi-structured
parent–child play session. All sessions were transcribed at
the word-level. The 204 transcripts analyzed consisted of
465,474 words (99,210 of children’s speech, CS) and 4143
unique words (2185 in CS). 1334 unique iconicity-rated
words were found (899 in CS), covering 32% of all unique
words used (41% in CS) and 78% of all used words (72% in
CS). The systematicity coding covered 699 employed
unique words (515 in CS): 17% of all employed unique
words (12% in CS) and 26% of all employed words (24% in
CS). Altogether, the iconicity, systematicity, and
concreteness coding covered 698 employed unique words
(514 in CS): 17% of all employed unique words (12% in
CS) and 26% of all employed words (24% in CS).

Methods
Participants
As part of an ongoing longitudinal study investigating
language acquisition in young children with autism
spectrum disorder (Goodwin, Fein, & Naigles, 2012; Tek,
Mesite, Fein, & Naigles, 2014), we recruited 35 typically
developing children (6 girls, mean age at onset = 20.27
months, 95% CIs: 19.78 20.93). All children were
monolingual English learners. Their average verbal IQ at
visit 1 (as measured by MSEL-EL, cf. below) was 19.89
(95% CIs: 18.4 21.76) and perceptual IQ at visit 1 (as
measured by MSEL-VR, cf. below) 26 (95% CIs: 24.83
27.09).

Analysis
Separately for child-produced and child-directed speech, we
produced mixed effects growth curve models assessing the
development of iconicity over time in 4 steps. First we used
iconicity as outcome measure, visit (linear and squared) as
fixed factor, and child ID as random effect, including visit
as random slope. Second, we controlled whether the results
were preserved when controlling for measures of word

Iconicity, systematicity, and concreteness
Iconicity ratings were taken from two previous studies,
which collected ratings for 3001 English words (Perry et al.,

concreteness and systematicity by adding to the first model
these measures as fixed effects. Third, we controlled for
effects of verbal and nonverbal initial IQ: to the first model
we added MSEL-EL and MSEL-VR at visit 1, both as main
effects and as interactions with visit. Due to the high colinearity between verbal and nonverbal IQ (r=-0.712), high
caution should employed in interpreting the results. Finally,
we tested whether significant changes of iconicity over time
were due to changes in iconic or in arbitrary words. Iconic
words were defined as words with an iconicity score above
1 (531 unique words), arbitrary as words with a score
between -0.5 and 0.5 (421 unique words). We employed a
mixed effects Poisson regression with number of iconic
words as outcome, visit (linear and squared) as fixed factor,
overall number of words produced by the speaker as offset
and child ID as random factor including visit as random
slope. This analysis was repeated for unique iconic words
and for overall and unique arbitrary words. All analyses
were run employing R 3.3.2, RStudio 1.0.136, lme4 1.1-12
and tidyverse 1.1.0 (Bates et al., 2014; RCoreTeam, 2016;
RStudioTeam, 2016; Wickham, 2017).

p<0.001), though not in unique arbitrary words used
(b=0.15, SE=0.09, p=0.08), cf. Figure 2.

Adults’ speech
Next we examined how iconicity in parents’ speech changed
over the six visits. Similar to children’s speech, we found
that iconicity decreased significantly over time (linear: b=0.05, SE=0.03, p=0.002; quadratic: b=0.03, SE=0.02,
p=0.08), cf. Figure 1. When controlling for systematicity
and concreteness, we still observed analogous results.
Iconicity decreases over time (linear: b=-0.07, SE=0.02,
p<0.001; quadratic: b=0.04, SE=0.02, p<0.001). Like with
children’s speech, concreteness is a significant predictor of
iconicity (b=0.1, SE=0.003, p<0.001). However, unlike
children’s speech, systematicity is also a significant
predictor of iconicity (b=-0.06, SE=0.003, p<0.001).
Next, we examined the role of children’s individual
cognitive skills in the iconicity of parents’ speech. With
verbal and nonverbal IQ added to the model, we observed
analogous effects, but modulated by the children’s
individual cognitive skills. Iconicity decreases over time
(linear: b=-0.06, SE=0.009, p<0.001; quadratic: (b=0.03,
SE=0.009, p=0.001). Verbal IQ did not affect the general
level of iconicity (b=-0.004, SE=0.005, p=0.44), but it
interacted significantly with time: the higher the verbal IQ,
the stronger the linear decrease in iconicity (b=-0.03,
SE=0.01, p=0.02) and the smaller the slowdown (b=0.03,
SE=0.01, p=0.004). Nonverbal IQ did not seem to affect
iconicity (p’s>0.4).

Results
Children’s speech
First, we analyzed whether the iconicity in children’s speech
changed over the six visits. We found that iconicity
decreases significantly over time (linear: b=-0.63, SE=0.11,
p<0.001; quadratic: b=0.43, SE=0.09, p< 0.001), cf. Figure
1. When controlling for systematicity and concreteness, we
still observed analogous results. Iconicity decreases over
time (linear: b=-0.19, SE=0.05, p<0.001; quadratic: b=0.14,
SE=0.04, p<0.001). Concreteness is a significant predictor
of iconicity (b=0.06, SE=0.007, p<0.001), but not
systematicity (b=0.004, SE=0.007, p=0.565).
Next, we examined whether individual cognitive skills
play a role in the iconicity of children’s speech. When
verbal and nonverbal IQ were added to the model, we
observed analogous effects, but modulated by these
individual variables. Iconicity decreases over time (linear:
b=-0.63, SE=0.1, p<0.001; quadratic b=0.44, SE=0.09,
p<0.001). The higher the verbal IQ, the lower the iconicity
(b=-0.11, SE=0.03, p<0.001), with only a marginal
interaction with visit (linear: b=0.23, SE=0.12, p=0.07;
quadratic: b=-0.11, SE=0.11, p=0.3). Nonverbal IQ did not
have a main effect on iconicity (b=-0.002, SE=0.03,
p=0.95), and it marginally modulated the effect of time: the
higher the nonverbal IQ, the bigger the linear iconicity
decrease (b=-0.22, SE=0.12, p=0.07) and the bigger the
quadratic slowdown (b=0.19, SE=0.11, p=0.08).
Finally, we examined whether the decrease in iconicity
over time resulted from a decrease in the use of iconic
words or an increase in the use of more arbitrary words. We
observed no significant change over time in the frequency of
iconic words used, either overall uses or by unique tokens
(p’s>0.17). However, there was a significant increase over
time in the overall use of arbitrary words (b=1.07, SE=0.1,

iconicity more to the children’ actual cognitive skills than to
their age.
These findings, along with several other studies, show a
robust relationship between the iconicity of spoken words as
garnered from native speaker ratings, and their prevalence in
early communication between children and caregivers
(Massaro & Perlman, 2017; Perry et al., 2015; Perry et al.,
in press; also see Thompson et al., 2012 for similar results
with British Sign Language). They support the hypothesis
that iconicity plays a role in facilitating early vocabulary
learning. Additionally, they highlight the possible role of
iconicity in children’s production. Iconicity of words may
not just facilitate comprehension of their meaning, but also
foster “thinking for speaking” during the beginning phases
of learning to produce meaningful words (cf. Slobin, 2006).
However, it is also important to note that young children
and their parents clearly use a high proportion of arbitrary
words too, even as they show a relatively higher inclination
to use iconic words.
Our findings suggest several directions for future research
on iconicity in early word learning. One important question
is whether iconic words actually help children gain the
referential insight, which would then ease the way for
learning more arbitrary words. Alternatively, iconic words
might simply be more readily acquired and put to use, which
potentially could still facilitate subsequent word learning by
bolstering early vocabulary. A second direction for future
research is to investigate the more fine-grained temporal
dynamics of iconicity in the unfolding interaction. Do
parents and children adapt to each other’s level of iconicity,
and if so, do they do that on a turn-by-turn base, or at a
more general level? Finally, future research might examine
how iconic words are used with other iconic devices, such
as prosody and iconic gesturing. For example, parents might
modulate the prosody of their speech in iconic ways, which
could help children with comprehension and word learning
(Nygaard et al., 2009).
The current study adds to accumulating research showing
iconicity in the lexicons and grammars of spoken and signed
languages alike (Dingemanse et al., 2015; Perniss et al.,
2010). This research suggests that iconicity is a fundamental
property of languages – a complement to arbitrariness. Our
findings show how iconicity may play an important role in
children’s earliest conversations, even in a spoken language
like English that lacks a large inventory of widely
recognized iconic words.

Finally, different from children, we observed a significant
decrease over time in the overall frequency of iconic words
(b=-0.7, SE=0.03, p=0.012), and a marginal decrease in the
number of unique iconic words used (b=-0.09, SE=0.05,
p=0.058), with no significant quadratic components
(p’s>0.3). In contrast, we observed no significant change
over time in the frequency of arbitrary words, either overall
or by number of unique tokens (p’s >0.195), cf. Figure 2.
Table 1 shows words with iconicity ratings of 1.5 or
higher from the 100 most frequent words used by children
and parents during visits 1 and 6. Children produced 28
high-iconicity words during visit 1 and 18 during visit 6.
Parents produced 13 such words during visit 1 and 10
during visit 6.

Discussion & Conclusion
Developmental psychologists have proposed that iconicity
may facilitate early word learning, helping children to
bridge the sounds of words with their meanings. To
investigate this hypothesis, we used iconicity ratings for a
large set of English words to examine iconicity in the
speech of children and parents.
We found that iconicity decreases over language
development in both child-produced and child-directed
speech. These patterns held after controlling for
concreteness and systematicity of the words. In children, the
overall decrease in iconicity is driven by an increase in the
use of more arbitrary words, rather than a decrease in iconic
words. This contrasted to parents, who decreased their use
of iconic words, but maintained the frequency of arbitrary
words. Our analysis of individual verbal and nonverbal IQ
showed that children’s level of cognitive ability modulated
their transition to the more frequent use of arbitrary words.
The results also suggest that parents may adapt their
