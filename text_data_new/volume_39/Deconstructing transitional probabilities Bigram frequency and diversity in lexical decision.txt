Abstract
Statistical learning paradigms traditionally use transitional
probabilities as a measure of statistical distribution within a
language. The current study suggests that alternative metrics
may exist that can account for differences in language
processing ability. Two primed lexical decision tasks are used
to examine the effects of bigram frequency and diversity on
speed and accuracy of word recognition. It is demonstrated
that both frequency and diversity contribute to word
recognition
performance;
findings
and
theoretical
implications are discussed.
Keywords: Statistical learning; lexical decision; language

Introduction
Humans are superlative learners capable of identifying and
tracking patterns in their environment, both implicitly and
explicitly. This ability has been investigated using both
implicit and, more recently, statistical learning paradigms
(Perruchet & Pacton, 2006) across a number of different
domains including shapes (Kirkham, Slemmer, & Johnson,
2002), music (Daikoku, Yatomi, & Yumoto, 2014; Koelsh
et al., 2016; Saffran et al., 1999), tactile stimuli (Conway &
Christianson, 2005) and, most prominently, language
acquisition (Newport & Aslin, 2004; Saffran, Aslin, &
Newport, 1996; Thiessen, & Erickson, 2013; Vouloumanos,
2008) highlighting the ability of learners, ranging from
infant (Saffran et al., 1996) to adult (Koelsh et al., 2016), to
track the transitional probabilities (TPs) within a given set
of stimuli.
Over the past two decades a plethora of researchers have
investigated this phenomenon and have found transitional
probabilities to be a robust indicator of performance across a
number of different tasks and languages (e.g. Liu & Kager,
2011; Toro, Sinnett, Soto-Faraco, 2005). This has led to the
acceptance of TPs as the standard metric of co-occurrence
within natural (and artificial) languages. However, if we
consider that the TP of any given stimulus stems from an

interaction between the frequency of sequence XY and the
number of potential candidates for Y then we are presented
with two alternative metrics of statistical distribution.
These, in turn, can be used to investigate the types of
statistics which learners can attend to.
When applied to words in natural language these metrics
can be termed Bigram Frequency, which is equal to the total
number occurrences for a given sequence of two words
within a language or representative selection thereof; and
Bigram Diversity which can be defined as the number of
items that potentially follow word X in the sequence XY.
It is logical to presume that both bigram frequency and
diversity would be predictive of performance in languagerelated tasks. Evidence from Freudenthal et al. (2015)
demonstrates that a frequency-based chunking mechanism
can successfully reduce output errors in childrenâ€™s speech.
This suggests that learners can track not only the TPs of the
bigrams but also the frequency with which they occur. No
evidence yet exists for a diversity-driven account of
language proficiency. Nonetheless, it is recognised that
predictability is an important facet of language processing
(Bates & MacWhinney, 1987; Glenberg & Gallese, 2012;
Goldberg, Casenhiser, & Sethuraman, 2005; Pickering &
Garrod, 2004, 2007; Van Berkum et al., 2005); it follows
therefore that a larger number of potential competitors for
stimulus Y would serve to reduce predictability and thereby
prove detrimental to response fluency.
Historically statistical learning paradigms such as those
developed by Jusczyk and Aslin (1995, also Saffran, Aslin
& Newport, 1996) have exposed learners to artificial
languages with carefully built-in TPs. This allows for
admirable control of the input at the expense of both
diversity and complexity. It has been argued that these
languages are too simplistic to assess the extent to which
learners are able to process distributional statistics within
natural language (Frank et al, 2010; Johnson & Tyler,
2010). To highlight this point, Saffran et al. (1996) reported

3398

inter-syllable TPs of 1.0 in their seminal study whereas
naturally occurring TPs are often considerably lower (the
bigram little baby has a TP of less than 0.002).
Thus, the true test of statistical learning theories is their
application to a more naturalistic dataset, one which retains
the complexity and diversity of natural language whilst
allowing for the accurate tracking of distributional cues;
natural language corpora represent such datasets. The
British National Corpus (BNC) is a collection of
contemporary natural language which comprises
approximately 100-million words of written and spoken
British English drawn from a variety of sources ranging
from telephone calls to academic journals. By analysing the
distributional statistics within the BNC it is possible to
present learners with verisimilar but also quantifiable
samples of natural language.
This raises another issue however, in that learners already
have a great deal of experience interacting with natural
languages. This makes traditional methods of testing such as
those used by Saffran et al. (1996, also Frank et al., 2010;
Jusczyk & Aslin, 1995) unsuitable for natural language
stimuli. Thus, two solutions are immediately apparent; the
use of unfamiliar or non-native languages or an alternate
method of assessment. Non-native languages would seem to
be the ideal solution except that the complexity of these
languages means that learners require either long periods of
familiarisation or simplified samples in order to obtain
actionable data. It is therefore favourable to introduce an
alternate measure of language proficiency whilst retaining
the complexity of the language and avoiding a lengthy
familiarisation process.
The current study seeks to address this issue by assessing
language proficiency using a primed lexical decision task
(LDT) where the first word of a bigram acts as the prime
and the second word the target. It is predicted that, using
bigram frequency and diversity as statistical primes,
response time for stimuli Y will be predicted by the strength
of its association with prime X. Based on this prediction two
hypotheses are proposed:
H1: Response times on a LDT will be quicker when
primed with high frequency bigrams compared to low
frequency or non-bigrams, and
H2: Response times will also be quicker when primed
with low diversity bigrams compared to high diversity or
non-legal bigrams

Method
Participants
Thirty-one participants (25 females) aged between 18 and
41 years (M= 20.77, SD= 4.17) were recruited from
Nottingham, UK. All participants reported English as their
first language and were screened for language difficulties.
Participants took part in both experiments and received
research credits in exchange for their participation where
applicable. An a priori power analysis showed that a sample
of at least twenty-four participants was necessary to achieve
statistical power of above .8.

Experiment One
Design
Experiment one used a LDT to assess the extent to which
bigram frequency affects word recognition. The aim of the
experiment was to identify any statistical priming effect that
may result from high frequency word pairs within natural
language.

Materials
Three 30-item lists were generated using bigrams found
within the BNC in addition to one 90-item non-word list
which was created using entries from the ARC Non-word
database (Rastle, Harrington, & Coltheart, 2002). The BNC
contains only samples of British English which increases its
validity as a natural language representation for a UK
sample.
Bigrams were extracted from the BNC by using a python
script to parse the .xml version of the corpus into word pairs
before writing them to a database and tallying the number of
occurrences. This resulted in a list of 12,293,349 unique
bigrams. A further script was used to remove any bigrams
with a frequency of less than 0.1 per million since these
were considered too infrequent to provide meaningful data.
The remaining corpus was then filtered to exclude any
bigrams containing acronyms, initialisations, contractions,
hyphenations, non-standard or non-English words, names,
numbers expressed as digits, or words with fewer than three
letters.

Stimuli lists were organised according to the frequency
with which the bigrams occur within the BNC; the three
lists contained bigrams of high (>100 occurrences) or low
frequency (<20 occurrences), or bigrams consisting of
words that do not appear together in the BNC. A number of
metrics were obtained for each of the bigrams including
word frequency (http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bncfreq/flists.html),
concreteness (Brysbaert, Warriner, & Kuperman, 2014),
number of letters, and number of phonemes. Due to the
nature of the sample exact matching across conditions was
impossible without compromising the number of available
bigrams, however word lists were balanced so as to not
differ significantly on any of these characteristics (each p >
0.05); list diagnostics are presented in table 1. Individual
word frequencies were log-transformed. Examples of
stimuli can be seen in Table 2.

time between the high and low frequency bigrams (M =
6.310, SD = .080), non-bigrams (M 6.507, SD = .101) and
non-words (M = 6.548, SD = .130).
Bigram frequency had a significant effect on response
time, F(3,28) = 53.759, p < .001, Î·p2 = .852. Post hoc
pairwise comparison using Bonferroni correction show that
words in the non-bigram condition were recognised more
slowly than those in both the high (p < .001) and low (p <
.001) bigram frequency conditions. There was no difference
between high and low frequency bigrams (p = .305). Nonwords were recognised more slowly than words in the high
frequency (p < .001), low frequency (p < 0.001), and nonbigram conditions (p < .038). Figure 1 illustrates these
differences.

Procedure
Participants were presented with letter strings and were
asked to indicate whether the string constituted a real
English word by pressing either â€˜zâ€™ or â€˜mâ€™ on a standard
QWERTY keyboard; key mapping was systematically
varied so that half of all participants used â€˜zâ€™ to indicate a
word and â€˜mâ€™ to indicate a non-word whilst half responded
with â€˜mâ€™ for words and â€˜zâ€™ for non-words. Strings were
presented for a maximum of 1500ms and were immediately
preceded by a 75ms prime. All prime-target pairs mapped
exactly onto bigrams from the stimuli lists whereby the first
word of the bigram acted as a prime and the second word as
the target. A fixation point was presented in the centre of the
screen for 500ms prior to each trial. Prime-Target pairs were
presented in two blocks each containing fifteen lowfrequency bigrams, fifteen high-frequency bigrams, fifteen
non-bigrams, and forty-five non-word trials. The order of
presentation for both blocks and trials was randomised for
each participant.

Analysis and Results
All participants scored more than 80% on the LDT. Data
was then trimmed to exclude incorrect responses as well as
those made faster than 200ms, slower than 1500ms (Perea et
al., 2016), or more extreme than three standard deviations
from the participantâ€™s mean (Madan et al., 2016), following
this procedure 2.29% of correct trials were removed across
participants.
All response time data were log-transformed; data was
then analysed categorically using a repeated-measures
analysis of variance to identify any differences in response

frequency, bars depict standard error

A further repeated-measures analysis of variance was also
conducted to assess any differences in response accuracy
between the four conditions. Response accuracy also shows
an effect of bigram frequency, F(3,28) = 6.796, p = .001, Î·p2
= .421. Post hoc analyses using Bonferroni correction show
that participants responded less accurately to words from the
non-bigram condition than those in the high (p = .005) or
low (p = .002) frequency conditions. All other comparisons
were non-significant (each p > .062). Figure 2 shows means
and standard error for accuracy.

Procedure
The experimental procedure was identical to that used in the

Analysis and Results
All participants scored more than 80% on the LDT. Data
was trimmed in the same way as the first experiment and a
total of 2.04% of correct trials were removed. Response
time data was log-transformed.
Data was analysed categorically using a repeatedmeasures analysis of variance to identify any differences in
response time between the high (M = 6.375, SD = .054),
low (M = 6.395, SD = .059) and no diversity (M = 6.422,
SD = .581) bigrams as well as non-words (M = 6.548, SD =
.130); means and standard error can be seen in Figure 3.

Experiment Two
Design
Experiment two used a LDT to assess the extent to which
bigram diversity affects word recognition. The aim of the
experiment was to identify any statistical priming effect that
may result from the predictability of the second word in a
bigram given the diversity of the first.

Materials
Stimuli were obtained and processed using an identical
procedure to experiment one with the exception that the
word lists were organised according to high (>100 potential
followers) or low (<2 potential followers) diversity or
bigrams consisting of primes that do not have followers
within the BNC. Word lists were balanced in the same way
as the first experiment, each p >0.06 with the exception that
the low diversity list differed significantly from both the
high and no diversity list on concreteness (high: p <0.01, no:
p <0.01); this is due to the relative scarcity of low diversity
bigrams within the BNC and the theoretical decision to
prioritise controlling individual word frequency since this
represents the largest predictor of word recognition
performance (Brysbaert & New, 2009; Ferrand et al., 2010;
Keuleers, Diependaele, & Brysbaert, 2010; Keuleers et al.,
2012; Yap & Balota, 2009). List diagnostics are presented
in table 1. Individual word frequencies were logtransformed. Example stimuli can be seen in Table 3; none
of the bigrams were repeated across the two experiments.

3401

Figure 3: Non-transformed group means for bigram
diversity, bars depict standard error

Bigram diversity had a significant effect on response time,
F(3,28) = 35.932, p < .001, Î·p2 = .794. Post hoc pairwise
comparison using Bonferroni correction shows that nonwords were recognised more slowly than those in high (p <
.001), low (p < .001) and no diversity (p < .001) conditions.
Words in the no diversity condition were also recognised
more slowly than those in both the high (p = .007) and low
(p = .011) diversity conditions; there was no significant
difference between high and low diversity bigrams (p =
.261).
Bigram diversity had no effect on response accuracy,
F(3,28) = 1.486, p = .208.

Comparison with Transitional Probability
Transitional probabilities were calculated for all bigrams
using the formula:
P(Y|X) = P(Y, X)
P(X)
Where Y is the target stimulus and X is the initial word of a
given bigram pair.
An item analysis was then run using a multiple linear
regression with data from both experiments to assess the
relationship between response time (log-transformed) on a
LDT and the three key variables bigram frequency, bigram
diversity, and transitional probability, F(3, 168) = 2.937, p =
.035. Individual coefficients (see Table 4.) indicate that
bigram frequency represents the strongest predictor of word
recognition performance; neither bigram diversity or TP
were significant predictors of response time.

Discussion
The current study aimed to assess whether bigram frequency
and bigram diversity would have an effect when used as
primes in a LDT. Findings from the categorical analyses
suggest a binary interaction between bigram frequency and
response time where naturally occurring bigrams are
recognised significantly more quickly than illegal bigrams
or non-words. The same is also true for bigram diversity.
This suggests that any amount of exposure to a language
is beneficial regardless of the frequency or diversity of
individual structures within the input. This is an interesting
effect which may have been overlooked by previous studies
that have focussed on TPs since the methodologies

employed tend to focus on recognition of familiar versus
unfamiliar strings. It could be argued however that the
bigram frequencies presented in the current study, although
highly infrequent, do not accurately represent the extremes
of low frequency within the BNC. It is therefore suggested
that further investigation needs to access frequencies of less
than 0.1 per million in order to identify the absolute
minimum amount of exposure required to elicit statistical
priming effects.
Comparison of the key predictors also suggests that
bigram frequency outperforms TPs as a predictor of
response time in a statistically primed LDT. This can be
attributed to the lower computational costs associated with
tracking bigram frequency compared to the calculation of
TPs. To the authors knowledge, the current study is the first
to assess statistical learning using a LDT. These findings
should therefore be interpreted with caution until they can
be demonstrated in alternative paradigms.
It is proposed that the findings presented are evidence for
the use of metrics other than TP in statistical learning
paradigms, particularly when applied to natural language
where TPs tend to be very small. A case can also be made
that LDTs are a viable paradigm for the investigation of
statistical effects in natural language where traditional
recognition tasks may not be appropriate.
Crucially, they suggest that theories of statistical learning
can deal with the scale-up in variety and complexity that
comes from moving between artificial and natural
languages. This begins to address one of the most
fundamental criticisms of statistical learning theory.
When interpreting the data presented herein it would be
prudent to consider that, although the BNC constitutes a
multifarious selection of British English it does not
encapsulate the entirety of written and spoken language. It is
therefore posited that any findings presented be considered
as representative rather than absolute in their accuracy.
Future investigation should include the analysis of alternate
corpora in order to ensure that any results are not artefactual
in nature.
It is recognised that neither bigram frequency or diversity
represent a complete account of statistic learning, nor is it
suggested that learners utilise these metrics in place of TPs.
Rather, it is posited that bigram frequency and, to a lesser
extent, diversity constitute â€˜another brick in the wallâ€™ which
may one day lead to a comprehensive understanding of how
humans process language.
In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that
individuals are capable of using bigram frequency and
diversity to respond to statistical primes in a lexical decision
task and that these metrics may be comparable to
transitional probabilities when applied to natural language.
