Abstract
Studies of dyslexics, whose implicit memory is impaired,
suggest that their implicit inference of sound statistics and its
integration into perception is inefficient. Specifically,
dyslexics' implicit memory decays faster and consequently
only accumulates information over shorter temporal windows.
We now ask whether this abnormal dynamic is domain general
by measuring its cortical distribution. We measure the
dynamics of behavioral context effects and the concurrent
neural adaptation during fast acquisition fMRI. We find a
similar pattern of fast decay of adaptation across a broad range
of cortical areas, though most significant effects are found in
auditory cortex. This broad neural distribution suggests that the
relevant aspect of implicit statistical inferences is not the nature
of stimuli, but their temporal distribution.
Keywords: implicit memory; adaptation; fMRI; dyslexia,

statistical learning.

Background
Implicit statistical learning has a profound measurable effect
on performance in perceptual discrimination tasks.
Seemingly simple and unbiased, serial discrimination places
an asymmetric memory load on sequentially presented
stimuli. The stimulus presented first has the highest memory
load, since it needs be retained until the subsequent stimulus
is presented. Hence, relying on priors to compensate for noisy
representations is crucial for accurately inferring the
perceived stimulus. Priors can be utilized to modify noisy
representations into a maximum likelihood estimate of
stimuli, those based on previous exposures that led to the
formation of priors. The integration of priors has been
modeled computationally in the context of auditory
perception for signal detection tasks (Treisman & Williams,
1984) and recently for 2-tone frequency discrimination
(Raviv et al., 2012, 2014; reviewed in Bausenhart, Bratzke,
& Ulrich, 2016). Raviv et al. (2012) model asserts that
participants do not compare the representations of the first
and second tones, as requested to do and as they
introspectively do. Rather, they compare the representation
of the second tone to the integrated representation of the first
tone with the estimated mean (prior) of previous stimuli.
Thus, the representation of the first tone is contracted towards
the mean of previous trials, and when this contraction is in

the direction of the correct response, the success rate will
increase.
Accordingly, trials in this serial discrimination task can be
divided into those in which contraction increases the
perceived difference between the two stimuli, hence
increasing success rate (Bias+), and trials in which
contraction decreases the perceived difference, and decreases
the success rate (Bias-). The magnitude of the contraction can
be quantified as the difference in performance on these two
types of trials.
Contraction bias in serial comparison tasks has been
observed in the visual (Ashourian & Loewenstein, 2011;
Fischer & Whitney, 2014; Lages & Treisman, 1998;
Liberman, Fischer, & Whitney, 2014), auditory (Lu,
Williamson, & Kaufman, 1992; Raviv et al., 2012; Treisman
& Williams, 1984) and tactile (Hairston & Nagarajan, 2007)
modalities, and was even observed in tactile velocity
discrimination tasks in rats (Fassihi, Akrami, Esmaeili, &
Diamond, 2014) and vibro-tactile discriminations in
monkeys (Romo, Hernández, Zainos, Lemus, & Brody,
2002).
Dyslexia is a wide spread learning disability which poses
an obstacle in acquiring academic education. It is probably
the most prevalent learning disability. Defined as a “specific
and significant impairment in the development of reading
skills that is not accounted for by mental age, visual acuity
problems, or inadequate schooling” (WHO, 2010), it affects
5% of the world’s population (Lindgren, De Renzi, &
Richman, 1985).
Dyslexics are diagnosed by their reading difficulty but are
also consistently found to have difficulties in non-linguistic
perceptual tasks (McAnally & Stein, 1996; Sperling, Lu,
Manis, & Seidenberg, 2005). Specifically, dyslexics exhibit
poorer utilization of implicit memory to compensate for noisy
observation (Ahissar, Lubin, Putter-Katz, & Banai, 2006;
Jaffe-Dax, Raviv, Jacoby, Loewenstein, & Ahissar, 2015;
Oganian & Ahissar, 2012). We recently accounted for this
deficient memory usage by faster recovery from neural
adaptation, as measure in Event Related Potential (ERP;
Jaffe-Dax, Frenkel, & Ahissar, 2017). Importantly, dyslexics
also exhibit poorer utilization of implicit memory in visual
discrimination tasks (Jaffe-Dax, Lieder, Biron, & Ahissar,
2016). Namely, their implicit memory impairment is not
modality-specific, but rather general multi-modal.

Results
We administered two-tone frequency discrimination to 20
dyslexics and 19 good readers in four conditions of trial
intervals: 3, 6, 9 and 15 seconds (trial onset to trial onset;
TOA). Implicitly, the representation of the first tone is
degraded and contracted towards the mean of previously
experienced tones (contraction bias). In Bias+ trials this bias
extended the perceived difference between the current pair
and improve their detectability; while in Bias- trials this bias
decreased the perceived difference between the current two
tones and hence hampered performance (Raviv et al., 2012).
We previously found that this implicit memory impact
decayed with the extension of inter-trial intervals – it was
weaker in conditions of longer inter-trials intervals than in
conditions with short inter-trial intervals (Jaffe-Dax et al.,
2017). We measured implicit memory as the difference in
sensitivity (d’) between Bias+ and Bias- trials and modelled
its decay using an exponential decay: 𝛥𝑑′ 𝑇𝑂𝐴 = 𝑎 +
𝑏 exp −𝑇𝑂𝐴 𝜏 , where 𝑎 denotes the estimated 𝛥𝑑′ at 𝑡 →
∞ (asymptotic level); 𝛽 denotes the difference between the
𝛥𝑑′ at 𝑡 = 0 and at 𝑡 → ∞ (decay magnitude); 𝜏 denotes the
time it takes for 𝛥𝑑′ (at 𝑡 = 0) to decay to 1 𝑒 (~37%) of its
initial value (temporal slope parameter). A small 𝜏 indicates
fast decay.
In this current study, we replicate faster implicit memory
decay among dyslexics outside of the magnet (in a training
session), but surprisingly not in-scan. In the training session
dyslexics’ implicit memory decay was faster than controls’
(group 𝜏 ± IQR: controls: 2.3 ± 3.4; dyslexics’: 0.4 ± 0.4; z =
2, p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test). Figure 1 shows the
difference in d’ between the trials that benefit from prior
integration and trials that loose from it as a function of intertrial interval. For both groups, we did not observe a
significant decay of implicit memory in the scanner, Perhaps
the scanner noise forced the subjects to compensate for their
noisy perception in all TOA conditions.

Importantly, even in linguistic tasks, compared to good
readers, dyslexics perceptual performance is adequate when
the stimuli are equally unfamiliar to both groups, and only
differ from peers in familiar contexts (Perrachione, Del Tufo,
& Gabrieli, 2011). This accumulative body of research stands
in contrast to both the traditional phonological deficit theory
of dyslexia (Snowling, 2000) and the claim for dyslexics’
overall noisy neural representation (Hancock, Pugh, & Hoeft,
2017).
Implicit memory is an inaccessible cognitive module
which has precise resolution, large capacity and long term
retention (Schacter, 1987). Contemporary studies define
implicit memory as a memory which does not depend on
Medio-Temporal lobe activity, or inaccessible to subject’s
awareness. This negative definition has been recently
challenged by a general theory of wide-spread cortical
plasticity in response to perceived events (Reber, 2013).
Implicit memory utilization has been recently quantified
using a heuristic approximation of Bayesian inference in
simple perceptual task (Raviv et al., 2012). This well-defined
grounded model of high level cognitive aptitude paved a way
for a search for well-defined neural mechanism which would
give rise to implicit memory.
While neural adaptation has a long history of research and
has been studied intensively in human and animals (Khouri
& Nelken, 2015), its cognitive role and behavioral
implication are yet poorly understood. The time scale of
recovery from neural adaptation has been linked with the time
scale of implicit memory trace (Lu et al., 1992). Our
preliminary findings of fast decay suggest that this rate of
decay of adaptation is a crucial machinery for statistical
learning. Though traditionally adaptation was considered as
reflecting fatigue, we gradually understand that it is used for
statistical learning and updating of categories (Kleinschmidt
& Jaeger, 2016).
In the current study, we used fMRI to localize dyslexics’
cortical site of fast decay of adaptation. We expected that, if
their deficit was specific to speech sounds, the difference in
dynamics would affect only specific areas of the temporal
lobe, and perhaps also some parietal areas. However, if their
deficit was domain general, then all areas activated by these
stimuli would show a similar pattern compared with controls.
Our results show, that all active regions exhibit faster
recovery from adaptation among dyslexics. We also found
additional support to the relation between implicit memory
and the time-scale of recovery from adaptation by replicating
the parallel finding of shorter adaptation and shorter implicit
memory in a special population - dyslexics. Our findings
suggest that neural adaptation in cortical areas that
correspond to the specific perceptual event carries implicit
memory.
This current study shows that dyslexics’ implicit memory
impairment is dictated by the dynamic decay of their
representation throughout the cortex and not by a modalityspecific difficulty.

We expected an attenuation of neural activity in the
conditions with short inter-trial interval relative to the
conditions with long inter-trial intervals, as neural adaptation
decays. Specifically, we fitted their BOLD activity in the four
ITI conditions to an exponential decay model (𝛽 𝑇𝑂𝐴 =
𝑎 + 𝑏 exp −𝑇𝑂𝐴 𝜏 ) and searched for regions in which the

model parameters (𝑎, 𝑏 or 𝜏) differed significantly between
the groups. Figure 2 shows the average groups’ parameters of
the exponential decay model. Throughout the cortex,
dyslexics’ estimated decay rate was faster than controls’ (i.e.
shorter 𝜏). This confirms our prior hypothesis regarding their
faster recovery from adaptation. Unexpectedly, the
asymptote level (𝑎) of the model also differed between the
groups. Specifically, the overall BOLD level of controls was
higher than dyslexics’. This could be attributed to overall
lower signal-to-noise ratio in dyslexics’ BOLD signal, but
surely worth further investigation and verification.
We compared the individually estimated parameters of
BOLD decay between the groups and found that the decay
time differed significantly in the left primary auditory cortex
(group 𝜏 ± IQR: controls: 25.4 ± 990.9; dyslexics’: 9.1 ±
113.2; z = 2.2, p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test).
Unexpectedly, the asymptotic level differed significantly in
this region (group 𝑎 ± IQR: controls: 10.4 ± 298; dyslexics’:
9.1 ± 113.2; z = 2.5, p < 0.05), in the left central gyrus
(controls: 7.7 ± 230.9; dyslexics’: 3.9 ± 12.5; z = 2, p < 0.05)
and in the right ventral frontal cortex (controls: 6.6± 180.1;
dyslexics’: 2.2 ± 55; z = 2.1, p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney Utests). Figure 3 shows the clusters which revealed significant
difference in estimated parameters between the groups.
These significant group differences were mostly apparent
in the cortical regions that are known to be most active during
this task (Daikhin & Ahissar, 2015). Recent study with
multiple types of stimuli reported reduced stimulus specific
adaptation in dyslexics across all related cortical regions
(Perrachione et al., 2016). In line with these findings, we

argue that shorter time scale of recovery from adaptation is a
general property of dyslexics’ cortex, which accounts for
their shorter retention of implicit memory.

Discussion
Adaptation is a simple, well defined candidate for the neural
basis of implicit memory. Assuming a labelled line of input
units, adaptation from previous stimuli should attenuate
responses to upcoming stimulus as a function of its proximity
to the previous stimuli. This proximity has both temporal and
parametric dimensions, such that similar stimuli should yield
a more attenuated response than dissimilar stimuli, and rapid
repeating stimuli should yield a more attenuated response
than slow repetitions.
In this work, we have presented evidence that neural
adaptation in modality specific cortical region decayed faster
in a special population of subjects, who also exhibited faster
decay implicit memory to the same modality. Taken together,
these parallel findings support the purposed model for
implicit memory.
A recent imaging study compared adaptation to similar
stimuli within a category among dyslexics and good readers.
Our suggestion is in line with the researchers’ findings of
deficient adaptation in dyslexics in every category-specific
cortical region that was measured (Perrachione et al., 2016).
Our findings suggest that the property of adaptation which
is impaired in dyslexics is the temporal dimension rather than
the similarity between stimuli. Namely, their adaptation
decay as a function of time and not as a function of
representational similarity (which was recently found intact

in dyslexics ;Boets et al., 2013). Thus, it is this dynamic
feature that governs implicit memory skills and deficits.

Methods
The demographic, cognitive and reading assessments of this
cohort is described in Jaffe-Dax et al., 2017.
In the two-tone frequency discrimination task, subjects
were asked to indicate which of the two tones had a higher
pitch. The tones were drawn from a uniform distribution
between 800-1250 Hz and the frequency difference within
each pair was randomly drawn between 1-20%. Each subject
performed 12 blocks of 16 trials. Each block had a constant
Trial Onset Asynchrony (TOA) of 3, 6, 9 or 15 seconds (in
random order). Subjects performed the task outside of the
scanner (training) and in-scan.
Stimuli were digitally constructed using Matlab 2015b
(The Mathworks Inc., Natwick, MA) and administered

through inserted sound attenuating MR compatible S14
earphones (Sensimetrics Corporation, Malden, MA).
Prior to the functional scan, a high-resolution (1 × 1 × 1
mm resolution) T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid
acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) images were acquired
using a 3-T Magnetom Skyra Siemens scanner and a 32channel head coil, at the ELSC Neuroimaging Unit (ENU).
The functional MRI protocols were based on a multislice
gradient echo-planar imaging and obtained under the
following parameters: TR = 1 s, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°,
imaging matrix = 64 × 64, field-of-view = 192 mm; 42 slices
with 3 mm slice thickness and no gap, were oriented in ACPC plane, covering the whole brain, with functional voxels of
3 × 3 × 3 mm and multiband parallel imaging with
acceleration factor = 3 (Moeller et al., 2010).
Each condition was modelled separately to account for its
contribution to the measured BOLD signal in each voxel, i.e.,
its 𝛽 values for each TOA condition. A spherical searchlight
with 4 voxels radius was performed centered at each voxel to

2270

average 𝛽 values for each condition. An exponential decay
model (see Results) was fitted to the smoothed 𝛽 values and
its parameters were estimated for each center voxel.
