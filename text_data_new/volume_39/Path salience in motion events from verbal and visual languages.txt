Abstract
Languages differ in the way they convey paths. S-languages
conveying manner of motion directly in a main verb, while Vlanguages require a separate verb. This difference has been
shown to influence the conceptualization and narration of
motion events. We therefore asked: would this difference arise
in the paths that people draw, particularly in visual narratives?
We annotated the representations of path information (source,
trajectory, goal) in a corpus of 35 comics from S- and Vlanguages. We found that panels from S-languages depicted the
path of an action more often than those from V-languages,
consistent with previous research on increased motion event
salience for S-languages. These findings suggest that the
conceptualization of paths from spoken language may
influence the graphic depiction of paths.

Introduction
Expressing information about the paths of actions is a
challenge to communication systems. Spoken language
expresses spatial relations with symbolic units. Languages
break down actions as moving from a source (starting point)
to a goal (endpoint) with some sort of manner (characteristic
of the path, i.e., bouncing, wiggling, sauntering, etc.) (Talmy,
1985). This can be encoded in a sentence using a satelliteframed construction, which places both manner and motion
into one verb (go, run), while a “satellite” expresses the path
in a preposition (out, in), as in She ran out of the room.
Alternatively, a verb-framed construction includes both
motion and path in a verb (Spanish: salir–“exit”, entrar–
“enter”), and separating manner into an additional verb
(corriendo–“running”), as in She exited the room running.
Corpus analysis has suggested that languages differ in which
of these constructions they primarily use (see Slobin, 2003
for summary). Satellite-framed “S-languages” (English,
German, Dutch, Mandarin) allow a main verb to contain
information about manner of motion, while verb-framed “Vlanguages” (Spanish, French, Japanese, Hebrew) express this
in a separate verb.
This difference in typology thus varies the salience of paths
in motion events between languages. For example, in a
sentence like He ran out of house, across the street, into the
bar, an S-language can easily covey one main verb, and
extend the manner of the path (running) across several event
segments using prepositions. In contrast, V-languages would
require a separate verb for each path (He exited the house,

crossed the street, entered the bar) and would need to add a
verb repeatedly to each clause to specify manner (running).
Because V-languages frame manner in a separate verb,
they demand extra effort and attention in contrast to the
increased salience of paths in motion events by S-languages
(Slobin, 2000, 2003). This difference in salience has
manifested in studies of mental imagery, translation, and
narration—often elicited from reading wordless visual
narratives. Narratives told by speakers of S-languages tend to
create units of successive events and draw focus to the
manner of motion, while those by speakers of V-language
often frame the setting and environment where motion events
happen, leaving both paths and their manner to inference
(Slobin, 2000, 2003).
Given that much previous work examined participants’
verbalized narration of wordless, drawn visual narratives,
would path salience be reflected in the drawing systems that
appear in visual narratives themselves? In drawings, motion
needs to be converted from dynamic movement into a static
depiction. Such information is implied by the postures of
figures in actions, and further clarified by graphic devices,
like motion lines, which overtly depict the path of an action
by trailing a moving object (Cohn, 2013; McCloud, 1993).
Motion lines differ in the “visual languages” used to draw
visual narratives throughout the world (Cohn, 2013;
McCloud, 1993) and their understanding is learned over time
(Friedman & Stevenson, 1975) and conditioned by
experience with comics (Cohn & Maher, 2015; Nakazawa,
2016). In addition, both behavioral and neurocognitive
research suggests that actions are more easily understood
when motion lines depict their paths than without motion
lines (Cohn & Maher, 2015; Ito, Seno, & Yamanaka, 2010).
Given that S- or V-languages differ in how they encode
properties of paths, might this salience of paths in visual
depictions differ based on a drawer’s spoken language? That
is, might the conceptualizations from one domain (e.g.,
speaking) “permeate” those of another domain (e.g.,
drawing) as a reflection of shared conceptual resources
(Cohn, 2016)?
A study by Tversky and Chow (2009) sampled panels out
of one comic each from Japan, Italy, America, and China.
These books crossed distinctions of Western cultures
(America and Italy) and Asian cultures (China and Japan), in
addition to crossing linguistic typology of S-languages

(Chinese and English) and V-languages (Japanese and
Italian). Panels were then rated on a scale of “action” vs.
“setting the scene” by American and Japanese participants.
Participants rated panels from China and America (Slanguages) as more “active” than those from Japan and Italy
(V-languages), but within these contrasts panels from Asian
countries (China, Japan) were rated as more active than those
from Western countries (America, Italy). These results
provide preliminary evidence that path information encoded
differently in S- and V-languages could influence the
drawings of speakers of those languages. Nevertheless, this
work was limited in that it included panels from only single
comics per group, and did not directly examine the depiction
of paths within those works, instead using “action” as a proxy
for paths.
We therefore further investigated this issue by coding the
component parts of paths directly in panels from various
comics from around the world. Paths were analyzed for their
component segments: a source (the start of the path), the goal
(the endpoint of the path), and the trajectory (the path
traversed). The manner is typically encoded in the trajectory.
In Figure 1, the ball is bouncing, but without that middle
segment, the ball would appear to move in a straight path. As
in Figure 1, an image could depict all three of these path
segments at once, or a panel could frame isolated segments
of a path (imagine each dotted box as images on their own,
or combining them for Source-Trajectory or Trajectory-Goal
segments).
We coded the properties of path information in 35 comics
from around the world, drawn by speakers of S-languages
(English, Mandarin, German) and V-languages (Japanese,
Korean, French). However, we also considered the possibility

that path information could vary as a function of the influence
of comics traditions. For example, American and Japanese
comics have been observed to use different types of motion
lines to depict the paths of moving objects (Cohn, 2013;
McCloud, 1993, 1996). Yet, motion lines were a highly
borrowed element from the Japanese Visual Language into
mainstream American comics during the influx of manga into
America in the 1990s. In addition, Original English Language
(OEL) manga are comics drawn in the “style” of Japanese
manga, but are created by speakers of English (an Slanguage). This is contrasted by Korean “manhwa,” which
are also imitative of the visual language of Japan, but come
from Asia and speakers of Korean—another V-language.
Chinese manhua (including “wuxia” from Hong Kong) are
also from Asia, but do not necessarily imitate the Japanese
Visual Language.
Following previous work, we reasoned that representations
from visual narratives produced by speakers of S-languages
(and optimized for those readers) would depict more paths
than those from V-languages. Specifically, they should depict
more trajectories, since that path segment illustrates its
manner.

V-language), as listed in Table 1. A full listing of works
analyzed appears in the Appendix. We attempted to retain the
same general genre (action, adventure, superhero, fantasy,
sci-fi) throughout all the books as best as possible. Coders
analyzed either a single issue, chapter, or episode in each
book, 25 pages, or 150 panels, whichever came first. This
amounted to an average of 23.8 pages and 136.1 panels per
book, across a total of 4,763 panels in 834 pages (see Table
1). All annotations were incorporated into the Visual
Language
Research
Corpus
(VLRC:
http://www.visuallanguagelab.com/vlrc/index.html).

Data Analysis
Trained coders independently analyzed each book panelby-panel across the areas of analysis with 60% of books were
annotated by two coders. Coders were trained through an
extensive course on visual language linguistics and prior to
coding scored above an 85% agreement on assessments of
their coding ability.
Coders identified whether a represented path depicted its
source (starting point), trajectory (midpoint and the path
itself), and/or goal (endpoint). Panels could involve an
isolated path segment (just source, trajectory, or goal) or
multiple segments together (ex. source-trajectory, trajectorygoal). We also annotated the cues used to signal these paths,
be they graphic devices like motion lines, or the postural cues
of figures in motion. We recorded the total number of path
segments in a given panel, and calculated the mean number
of instances by dividing the sum of path segments divided by
the total number of panels per book. Final analyses averaged
the means for each book between coders’ scores.
Our analyses looked at panels which included any path
segments (e.g., a panel with a trajectory, and/or both a
trajectory and goal), and those that panels depicting only an
isolated path segment (source, trajectory, or goal). Path
segments were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVAs
that set path segment (i.e., source, trajectory, goal) as the

origin (America, Asia, Europe) or language type (S- vs. Vlanguage) as the between-groups factor. Follow up analyses
examined the differences of each area of analysis within and
between groups.

Results

Our initial 2 x 3 repeated-measures ANOVA examined the
difference between path segments (source, trajectory, goal)
between different language types (S- vs. V-). We found main
effects of path segments and language type, as well as an
interaction between them (see Table 2). These analyses were
carried out both for panels with any path segment, and those
with isolated path segments. The main effect of path segment
arose because, across language types, trajectories were used
more than goals, which were used more than sources (all
ps<.05; see Figure 2). However, across both
analyses comics originally produced by

Figure 3: Path segments isolated to individual panels from various comics. Standard error is depicted.
Finally, to assess the differences between each comic type,
we used a 3 x 7 repeated-measures ANOVA to compare path
segments across all comic types. We found main effects of
path segments and comic type, and an interaction between
them (Table 2). As in Figure 3, in almost all types of comics,
trajectories appeared more than goals, which appeared more
than sources (all ps < .05). The exception to this was Japanese
manga, which depicted near equal amounts of trajectories and
goals. Follow up analyses showed comic types did not differ
in their depiction of isolated sources or goals when isolated
in panels (all ps > .364), but did differ for trajectories in both
analyses (all Fs > 7.3, all ps <.001) and between goals in
panels depicting any paths, F(6,28)=2.6, p<.05. Specifically,
the difference in isolated trajectories seemed to be motivated
by Chinese manhua, which used more trajectories than all
other comics (all ts > 4.1, all ps <.01) except French and
German comics (all ps > .16), while panels with any paths
including trajectories were higher in Chinese manhua than all
other comics (all ts > 3.5, all ps < .05), except trended higher
than German comics (p = .076). In addition, isolated
trajectories in Japanese manga and Korean manhwa were
fewer than in French and German comics (all ts > 3.1, all ps
<.05).

Discussion
This corpus analysis examined comics from seven different
types of comics from around the world to investigate whether
the depiction of path information varied on the basis of
culture and/or spoken language typology. Though we found
that path segments differed between comics, such variation
did not vary based on the comics’ continent of origin.

However, they did vary based on a comics’ original language
type.
On the whole, the trajectories of paths—i.e., the path
itself—were depicted more than the goals (endpoint) of the
paths, which in turn appeared more than the sources (starting
point). The prominence of goals over sources aligns with
findings that the endpoints of paths are more salient than
starting points in verbal language, and in perception and
attention (Lakusta & Landau, 2005; Regier, 1996, 1997).
However, the fairly consistent depiction of trajectories
beyond sources and goals suggests an importance for the
visual depiction of paths themselves in motion events, more
than their start or endpoint. This is consistent with the idea
that motion lines disambiguate actions by depicting their
paths (Cohn & Maher, 2015).
In addition, we found that trajectories isolated to their own
panels appeared more in the depictions of paths from visual
narratives from S-languages than V-languages. These
findings are also consistent with findings that the
conceptualization and narration of motion events are more
salient for speakers of S-languages than those of V-languages
(Slobin, 2000, 2003), and with previous work (Tversky &
Chow, 2009) showing panels from S-languages (English,
Chinese) are as rated more action-oriented than those from
V-languages (Japan, Italy). These findings support the idea
that the framing of path information in a spoken language
may influence its depiction in a drawn visual language.
Despite our finding of differences between comic panels
on the basis of spoken language typology, we found no
significant differences based on the comics’ continent of
origin. This differed from Tversky and Chow’s (2009)
finding of a split between how “active” panels were rated in

1797

Western and Asian comics. However, inspection of Tversky
and Chow’s reported data suggests that Chinese panels may
have driven the effect of higher ratings of “action” compared
to all others type. We too found that manhua exceeded the
depiction of paths of all other types of comics, though here it
may have offset differences between continents given the
relational similarities otherwise between pairs of books from
Asia (Korean, Japanese), America (US mainstream, OEL
manga) and Europe (French, German). The difference
between manhua and other types of comics—including those
from other S-languages—may support the classification of
Mandarin as variant from the binary split of S- and Vlanguage types (Chen & Guo, 2009).
The absence of variation between depictions of paths on
the basis of culture contrasts from findings across other
aspects of structure from the visual languages used in comics.
For example, previous corpus analyses have suggested
differences between cultures on the basis of comic panels’
attentional framing structure (Cohn, Taylor-Weiner, &
Grossman, 2012), narrative patterns across panels (Cohn, In
press), semantic transitions between panels (McCloud,
1993), and visual morphology like speech balloons
(Forceville, Veale, & Feyaerts, 2010). Combined with prior
findings, our results suggest that cross-cultural variation in
visual narrative systems may involve a diverse number of
factors including cultural specificity, visual language
patterns, and possibly influence from spoken languages.
Finally, given the differences between depictions of paths
on the basis of S- versus V-languages, this work hints at
“permeability” between the conceptualization made in
expressive domains, here between spoken languages and
drawings. This initial work could thus be followed by more
extensive corpus research, in addition to experimental
methods further examining these preferences. For example,
both behavioral and neurocognitive work has shown that
comic panels containing motion lines are easier to process
than those omitting such visualized paths (Cohn & Maher,
2015; Ito et al., 2010). While comic reading expertise
modulated these costs (Cohn & Maher, 2015), our findings
here might suggest cross-cultural variation in such
processing. Given the greater salience of paths for Slanguages, would speakers of these languages be more
sensitive to the absence of motion lines than speakers of Vlanguages, for whom depicted paths may be less salient?
Might path information thus be a factor in translations or
interpretations of comics across languages? This work can
hopefully sponsor further research into the potential
permeability between the conceptualizations in spoken and
visual languages.
