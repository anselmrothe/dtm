Abstract
Young children use informal strategies to solve arithmetic
word problems. The Situation Strategy First (SSF) framework
claims that these strategies prevail even after instruction. The
present study was conducted with second grade students in
order to investigate the persistence of intuitive, situationbased strategies, on word problems that do not involve
dynamic temporal changes. This is challenging for the SSF
framework, since the lack of this dimension might bypass
intuitive strategies. The results revealed that intuitive
strategies persist, are valid for these types of problems, and
impact the problems' difficulty. Indeed problems that require
the application of arithmetic principles remain hard, even
though they have been practiced at school. These findings
provide complementary evidence to how mental calculation
strategies articulate with arithmetic word problem solving and
call for the extension of the SSF framework.

Introduction
Even before instruction young children can solve
arithmetic word problems by usinginformal strategies
(Verschaffel& De Corte, 1997). These informal strategies
reflect the situation described in the problem and preclude
the flexible application of mathematical principles like
commutativity, inversion or distributivity (Verschaffel & De
Corte, 1997).During the early years of elementary school,
children improve their numerical competencies and acquire
certain mathematical principles, which could lead us to
expect that newly acquired arithmetic competencies would
take place over the informal strategies.
Indeed, numerous mental calculation strategies that
schooled children develop to solve problems when
presented in their arithmetic expression (e.g.'8 - 5=') have
been documented (e.g. Carpenter, Ansell, Franke, Fennema,
& Weisbeck, 1993; Torbeyns, De Smedt, Ghesquière, &
Verschaffel, 2009). They are mainly determined by the
arithmetic operation that provides the solution. For
subtraction problems, the principal distinction bears
between direct subtraction strategies in which the
subtrahend is straightforwardly taken away from the
minuend (e.g. in which '42 - 39 =' is solved by '42 - 39'), and
indirect addition strategies in which the calculation consists
in finding how much needs to be added to the minuend to
reach the subtrahend (e.g. in which '42 - 39 =' is solved by
'39 + . = 42'). In both of these strategies, the arithmetic

operation that is used is subtraction, it is just the arithmetic
format that is different (Campbell, 2008). In order to
describe how students use the two strategies, Peters,
DeSmedt, Torbeyns, Ghesquière, and Verschaffel (2013)
provided empirical support for their Switch model.
According to this model,students solve two-digit subtraction
problems by switching between direct subtraction and
indirect addition depending on the combination of the
magnitude of the subtrahend and the numerical distance
between the subtrahend and the minuend.
Brissiaud and Sander (2010) investigated how these
mental calculation strategies articulate with the informal
strategies students use on arithmetic word problem solving.
They proposed a Situation Strategy First (SSF) framework
which posits that the initial representation of a problem
activates asituation-based strategy, both before and after
instruction. Only when this strategy is not efficientthe
representation of the problem may be modified and a set of
arithmetic principles may be applied in order to provide an
adequate solution in a more efficient way. In their
experiments, each problem was presented to second and
third grade students in two versions. The first version could
be efficiently solved by mentally simulating the actions
described in the problem - situation strategy problems (Siproblems). For example:
I. Luc is playing with his 42 marbles at recess.
During the recess, he loses 3 marbles. How many
marbles does Luc have now? [42 - 3 = .]
Problem I is an Si-problem because simulating the action
of losing 3 marbles through mentally counting down from
42 is easy to perform(41 (1), 40 (2), 39 (3)). Thus, a
situation-based solving strategy, modeling the described
situation - the Si-strategy - is efficient.
For each Si-problem, a Mental Arithmetic counterpart
was introduced (MA-problem). MA-problems are problems
for which mental simulation is too costly to attain the result
– thus for which the Si-strategy is not efficient. On the
contrary, the use and application of arithmetic knowledge is
efficient and makes the problem easy (MA-strategy). For
example:
II. Luc is playing with his 42 marbles at recess. During
the recess, he loses 39 marbles. How many marbles does
Luc have now? [42 - 39 = .]
The solution to problem II cannot be efficiently obtained
by using the same procedure as for the first one; mentally
simulating the action by counting down 39 marbles would
be too costly. However the mental subtraction 42 – 39 is

2150

easy when the complement principle is mastered and leads
to counting up from 39 to 42.
The findings revealed that even after instruction, the Siproblems remained systematically and significantly easier
than the corresponding MA-problems. Furthermore, a
higher use of informal strategies was observed on Siproblems, while arithmetic principles were almost
exclusively used on MA-problems. For instance, when
students succeeded to solve an Si-problem such as Problem
I, they exclusively used a direct subtraction strategy, which
is the Si-strategy in this case. However, when they
succeeded to solve an MA-problem such as Problem II,even
though Si-strategies were (scarcely)observed, they were
solved to a greater extent by MA-strategies, such as looking
for a missing addend in the previous example (‘39 + . =
42’). This was never observed for Si-problems: no child
tried to solve a problem such as Problem I by the missing
addend'3+ . = 42'.
Indeed, the arithmetic computations of both Si- and MAstrategies on subtraction problems are executed by the
aforementioned mental computation strategies. The Switch
model could accurately account for how the various
arithmetic characteristics of the problems tested so far by
the SSF framework yield a clear computational advantage
for one strategy over another. However, the Switch model
does not provide an explanation for why students fail to
apply arithmetic principles, such as it is observed through
the significantly lower success rates on MA-problems.
Indeed, even though the Switch model accurately describes
the numerical conditions that require a switch between
direct subtraction and indirect addition, it does not account
for the mental re-representation needed in order to make this
switch when a presented strategy cannot be easily
performed in the same format as the one it is presented in.
We propose that the attainment of a mental rerepresentation would reflect an underlying conceptual
metaphor that guides the interpretation and application of
arithmetic principles. Conceptual metaphors are based on
everyday human experience. The underlying mathematical
ideas are constructed through cognitive mechanisms called
fictive motion, which refer to the conception of static
entities in dynamic terms (Lakoff & Núñez, 2001). One of
the main representations of arithmetic is object collection
(Lakoff & Núñez, 2001). The most widespread conceptual
metaphor of subtraction that can be drawn from itis "taking
away" (Fischbein, 1989; Lakoff and Núñez, 2001).
Alternatively, arithmetic can be considered as motion along
a path (Lakoff & Núñez, 2001). The conceptual metaphor of
subtraction that can be drawn from this conception is
subtraction as a measuring stick (Lakoff & Núñez, 2001), or
as "determining the difference" (Selter, Prediger,
Nührenbörger & Hußmann, 2012). As Selter and
collaborators (2012) pointed out, the "taking away" model
might be more widespread, however seeing subtraction

solely as "taking away" is too one-sided, and both models
are required in order to be flexible in mental arithmetic.
We consider that the failure to apply arithmetic principles
on MA-problems is due to a restrictive representation of
arithmetic, an intuitive representation(such as the "taking
away" model), which entails a limited interpretation of the
arithmetic situation embedded in the problem statement.
Such an extension of the SSF framework would also
challenge the most commonly used classification of
arithmetic word problems introduced by Riley, Greeno and
Heller (1983). Their classification determines the difficulty
of a problem based on the semantic category it belongs to,
while the SSF framework puts emphasis on situation-based
strategies and proposes thatthe efficiency of such strategies
would be also a determining factor of difficulty.
Yet, all the subtraction problems that were tested by
Brissiaud and Sander (2010) belonged to one same category
of subtraction problems from Riley, Greeno and Heller's
(1983) classification - change problems. These problems are
dynamic in nature and describe an action with a temporal
dimension,soliciting a mental simulation. However, the
other problem categories do not involve this temporal
dimension. They have been identified as more difficult than
change problems, especially "compare" problems, in which
a comparison between two quantities is involved and the
question bears on the difference or on one of the compared
quantities. It therefore remains an open issue if the mental
simulation advocated by the SSF framework is still relevant
for problems that do not unfold along a temporal dimension.
Indeed, if the mental simulation of the problem was not
solicited, then we could expect that the distinction between
Si- and MA-problems among these categories would lose its
relevance. It therefore remains an open issue if the mental
simulation advocated by the SSF framework is still relevant
for problems that do not unfold along a temporal dimension.
If it would be demonstrated that the efficiency of the mental
simulation influences a problem’s difficulty even when it
does not develop along a temporal timeline, it would
warrant a broader view of Si-strategies and provide a new
criterion for the assessment of problem difficulty, not based
only on the semantic category, but also on the efficiency of
the Si- strategy.

Aim of the study
The purpose of the study was to demonstrate that the
mental simulation of the arithmetic relations is not a mere
consequence of a dynamic semantics of the problem, but an
intrinsic property of arithmetic problem solving. Firstly, we
conducted a longitudinal study in order to test the
distinction between Si- and MA-problems in contexts less
favorable for a mental simulation. Secondly, we conducted
individual verbal reports in order to gather confirmatory
evidence of situation-based strategies for Si-problems and a
switch to non-situation-based strategies for MA-problems.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants
269 second grade students from 13 classes in 7 schools
from working-class neighborhoods participated in the study.
The average age of the children in January, when the first
test was passed, was 7.62 years (sd = 0.32, 138 girls).
Material
There were 8 addition and subtraction problem types
belonging to 3major categories:
- compare problems: difference set(D[b+ . =a],
D[a- . =b]) and compared set (C[b+b'= . ], C[ab= . ]),
- equalizing problems(E[b+ . =a], E[a- . =b]),
- combine problems(S[b+ . =a], S[b+b'= . ]).
The subtraction problems involved two numbers, a and b
(a>b). The numerical values for a were either 42, 41, 33 or
31, while in order to differentiate between Si- and MAproblems the values for b were either kept small (3 or 4) or
were close to a (39, 38, 29 or 27). To create Si-problems the
small value of b was used for the C[a-b= . ], while the b

value close to a was used for D[b+ . =a], D[a- . =b],
C[b+b'= . ], E[b+ . =a], E[a- . =b]n S[b+ . =a],
S[b-b'= . ]. To create MA-problems the opposite b value was
respectively used for each problem, since it would make the
Si-strategy costly.
Addition problems S[b+b'= . ] and C[b+b'= . ] involved
two numbers, b and b'. Both numbers had the same
characteristics as b for subtraction problems, while the
unknown value was equivalent to a. To create Si-problems
the b value close to a was presented first, while the small b
value (b') was presented second. To create MA-problems
they were presented in the opposite order.
Thus the numbers involved in the data and the solution
are (31, 27, 4), (33, 29, 4), (41,38, 3), and (42, 39, 3).
Note that the number size was not the determining factor
in the Si vs. MA-problem distinction. In the Si- versions one
problem had the b value close to a, while others had small b
values1. Also the second experiment was conducted to
support this, by directly investigating students' strategy use.
1

Furthermore, in the princeps study that introduced the SSF
framework, the small b values, and the ones close to a were
equally present in the Si- and MA-versions of the problems.

2152

Four different contexts were used for the wording of the
problems: marbles, euros, flowers and fruits.
Table 1 provides examples of each problem category.
Design
Children solved a total of 8 problems created by
combining the 8 problems categories in either their Si- or
MA- version. Each student therefore solved 4 Si-problems
and 4-MA-problems.To control for the impact of position,
numerical sets and context, 8 different problem sets were
created. Another 8 problem sets were 'mirror' sets in which
the Si-version of one problem would be presented in its MA
counterpart, while the MA-problem would be presented in
its Si-counterpart. Thus, 16 groups of problem sets were
created altogether and counterbalanced across classrooms.
Procedure
The experiment was composed of two sessions. The first
conducted in January and the second one, strictly identical
to the first one, 6 months later, in June. It was administered
in the students' classrooms. Each child received an 8 pages
booklet. There was a square in the middle of each page in
which they wrote their answer. Each problem was read
aloud twice to the whole classroom and children had one
minute to write down the number that was the solution.
Scoring
The solutions provided by the children were scored with 1
point when the numerical answer was exact, or within the
range of plus or minus one of the exact value, in order to
take into account mistakes in counting procedures. Any
other answer received 0 points. The average of the sum of
the scores on Si- and MA-problems was used as the
dependent variable and analyses on these scores were
carried out.
Results
A first analysis was conducted in order to compare
children's average success rates on Si- and MA-problems at
the beginning of the year, followed by a second set of
analyses in order to compare the success rates on the
problems at the end of the school year. A third analysis bore
on the progression over the year.
Repeated measure ANOVAs, with the 'Si- versus MAproblems' variable (further referred to as Problem type)as
within-participant independent variables, were conducted
for each session. The analyses of the scores obtained in
January showed a highly significant main effect of Problem
type
on
performance
(F(1,
268)=98.39,
p<
0.001,ƞ²=0.11).Table2displays the average success rates.
Indeed the Si-problems had a 19.57% higher success rate
than MA-problems.
In June, there was a significant difference in performance
between the two times of testing on Si-problems (F(1,268)=
86.39, p<.001, ƞ²=0.06) and on MA-problems
(F(1,268)=36.58, p<.001, ƞ²=0.05). Yet, in accordance with
our hypotheses, the results still revealed a highly significant
main effect of Problem type on performance in June
(F(1,268)=119.57, p<.001, ƞ²=0.13).As displayed in Table2,
the Si-problems had a 24.38% higher success rate than MAproblems in June (experiment 2).

Indeed, after performing a repeated measure ANOVA
with the Problem type and the times of testing as withinparticipant independent variables, the results confirmed that
there was a significant main effect of Problem type
(F(1,268)=171.64, p<.001, ƞ²=0.12) and a main effect of the
Time of testing (F(1,268)=106.19, p<.001, ƞ²=0.05), but
most importantly there was no interaction between the two
variables (F(1,268)=3.51, p>.1, ƞ²=0.001). Thus, as
hypothesized, despite the progress made on each problem
type throughout the year, the gap in performance persisted
between Si- and MA-problems.
In order to test the hypotheses problem per problem,
univariate ANOVAs, with the Problem type variable, were
conducted for each of the eight problem categories and
showed that almost all of the Si-problems were significantly
easier than the corresponding MA-problems both in January
and in June: D[a - . =b], C[b + b'= . ], C[a - b= . ], E[b + .
=a], E[a - . =b] and S[b + . =a] (3.843 <F(1, 267)<72.501,
p< .01, 0.01<ƞ²<0.20. The D[b+ . =a] seemed to be
particularly hard in January when no difference was
observed (F(1,267)=0.23, p>.1,ƞ²=0.001) (27.6% success
rate on Si- and 25% on MA-problems), but the Si- versus
MA-distinction was valid at the end of the year
(F(1,267)=15.63, p<.001, ƞ²=0.06)(47% success rate on Siand 24% on MA-problems). The single exception for which
no difference was observed on either time of testing was the
combine superset problem S[b+b'= . ] (January
F(1,267)=2.69, p>.1, ƞ²=0.01, June F(1,267)=1.223, p>.1,
ƞ²=0.005), for which a difference was observed in the
expected direction but not confirmed by the test (75% and
83% success rate on Si-problems and 66% and 77% on MAproblems, in January and June respectively).

Discussion
The results revealed that the distinction between Si- and
MA-problems remain relevant for subtraction and addition
word problems that do not evolve along a temporal timeline. Our study shows that indeed, problems efficiently
solved by direct modeling strategies remain easier for
students even after they acquired more advanced skills in
mathematics at the end of the year. The progression between
the two sessions did not obliterate the distinction between
Si-and MA-problems. The similar progression on Si- and
MA- problems might be explained by the advances children
made in computational execution of the calculations, or
regarding their general comprehension skills.
A second experiment was conducted in order to provide
confirmatory evidence that the difference in difficulty
between Si- and MA-problems actually results from the
preferential use of Si-strategies when they are efficient and
for the lack in the application of arithmetic principles when
this strategy is inefficient.

Experiment 2
We collected additional information concerning the
strategies children actually use when solving Si- and MAproblems. We asked them to solve problems and then to
describe their solving strategy aloud. We predicted that the
solution strategies which directly model the problem would
be predominant for Si-problems but that alternative
strategies would emerge for MA-problems.

Method
Participants
42 Grade 2 students from 4 classes in2 different schools
from working-class neighborhoods participated in the study.
The test occurred in June and the average age of the children
on the test was 7.93 years (sd = 0.26, 23 girls). None of the
participants participated in the previous experiment.
Material & Design
The same material and design was used as in the first
experiment.
Concerning the evaluated strategies, if we take the D[a- .
=b] problem as an example, the Si- strategy used to solve it
is to start from the largest presented quantity (31) and to
double-count downwards until the second quantity is
reached: in the Si-problem this would not be costly. The
students would describe their solving process as starting

from 31 and counting down30(1), 29(2), 28(3), 27(4),
bearing the answer 4, and noted by the experimenter as 31- .
= 27.Yet using the same Si-strategy of double-counting
downward in the MA-problem to get from 31 to 4 is a costly
procedure. When students would use this strategy they
would describe the same solving process: starting at 31 and
counting down30 (1), 29(2), 28(3), ... 5(26), 4(27), bearing
the answer 27 and noted by the experimenter as 31- . = 4.
Nevertheless, when applying arithmetic knowledge we
can easily know that taking away 4 from 31 provides the
correct numerical answer to this MA-problem. One of the
possible descriptions of the students' solving process would
be to start from 31 and take away 4, with the result no
longer being the number of times they counted down, but
the number they reached. This Non-Si-,mental arithmetic
strategy (MA-strategy) would be noted as '31- 4 = .'.
Procedure
The procedure was identical to the first experiment,
except that the test was conducted individually in the school
library and that after writing down the numerical answer,
the student was asked to explain aloud how he or she found
the solution. The possible strategies were established
beforehand and there was no ambiguity in their coding. The
strategies that the students reported were classified
according to table 3 into Si-strategies when the strategy
directly modeled the wording of the problem, or into Non-

2154

Si-strategies when the strategy that the student described did
not directly model the problem.
Scoring
For both Si- and MA-problems, we computed a score of
Si-strategies (Si-score) and Non-Si-strategies (Non-Siscore). If a pupil provided a correct answer and explained a
strategy, the nature of this strategy was assessed and
contributed 1 point to either the Si-strategy score or the
Non-Si-strategy score of the problem type. No points were
attributed if a student did not provide a correct response
and/or did not describe any strategy after providing the
correct answer (only 7.5% of the correct responses were not
accompanied by a strategy description). Given that children
solved 4 problems of each type, the scores ranged from 0 to
4.
Results
The experiment replicated the previous findings,
confirming that Si-problems were easier for children than
MA-problems. The success rates were 67.2% and 41.5%
respectively, and the variance analysis revealed that this
difference was significant (F(1,41)=17.86, p<.001, ƞ²=0.13).
Table 3 shows strategy use for each problem category and
the disparities between the two kinds of strategies, among
students that provided the right numerical solution and
described a strategy.
We further performed two variance analyses using the Sistrategy score and the Non-Si-strategy score as the
dependent variables, and Problem type as the within factor
variable. The average scores are presented in table 4.As
expected, both differences were significant. Si-strategies
were used significantly more on Si-problems (F(1,38)=79.1,
p<.001, ƞ²=.5), as well as Non-Si-strategies on MAproblems (F(1,38)= 20.06, p<.001,ƞ²=.2).

These findings suggest that the selected strategy drives the
difference in performance on top of the problem category or
factors such as mental calculation competences.

General Discussion and Conclusion
The experiments conducted in the present study account
for the spontaneous and intuitive modeling of the situation
described in arithmetic word problems, which leads to a
primary use of situation strategies and the application of
arithmetic principles only when the first one is too costly.
The significant difference that was observed between Siand MA-problems fits with the previous findings on change
problems (Brissiaud & Sander, 2010), and confirms that this

problem distinction is not specific to problems that evolve
along a temporal timeline. These findings complement the
traditional classification of arithmetic word problems
according to which problem difficulty depends mostly on
the problem category. They also provide evidence that
situation strategies are not only tied to the semantic wording
of a problem, but could be a fundamental property solicited
by arithmetic problems.
