scarcity affects prospective memory performance. Our study
is motivated by past work showing that people only start to
increase their efforts to accomplish their goals when a
deadline becomes salient (Gersick, 1988). Further, time
pressure causes fewer attributes to be considered when
choosing between alternatives (Wright, 1974). Given these
findings, we propose that time scarcity may enhance
attentional focus on the task at hand, while inducing neglect
of other information in the environment, even if the
information is beneficial. In two experiments, we examined
the attentional and memory consequences of time scarcity.

Abstract
Operating under limited resources poses significant demands
on the cognitive system. Here we demonstrate that people
under time scarcity failed to detect time-saving cues as they
occur in the environment (Experiment 1a). These time-saving
cues, if noticed, would have saved time for the time-poor
participants. Moreover, the visuospatial proximity of the
time-saving cues to the focal task determined successful
detection, suggesting that scarcity altered the spatial scope of
attention (Experiment 1b & 1c). People under time scarcity
were also more likely to forget previous instructions to
execute future actions (Experiment 2). These instructions, if
remembered and followed, would have saved time for the
time-poor participants. Failures of online detection and
prospective memory are problematic because they cause
neglect and forgetting of beneficial information, perpetuating
the condition of scarcity. The current study provides a new
cognitive account for the counterproductive behaviors in the
poor, and relevant implications for interventions.

Experiment 1a
The goal of the first experiment was to investigate how time
scarcity affects the online detection of information in the
environment. We hypothesize that time scarcity draws
attention to the focal task, while inducing neglect of other
useful information in the environment.

Introduction

Participants

The condition of scarcity is widespread and manifests in
many domains. For example, four billion people experience
severe water scarcity during at least part of each year
(Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2016), and more than 10% of the
world population live with less than US$1.90 per day
(World Bank, 2016). A growing body of evidence has
revealed how scarcity fundamentally shapes the way people
perceive the environment and behave accordingly (Mani,
Mullainathan, Shafir, & Zhao, 2013; Mullainathan & Shafir,
2013; Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012; Shah, Shafir, &
Mullainathan, 2015; Tomm & Zhao, 2016).
Since the cognitive system is limited in attentional and
working memory capacity (Baddeley, 1992; Luck & Vogel,
1997; Miller, 1956; Pashler, Johnston, & Ruthruff, 2001;
Rock & Gutman, 1981), scarcity induces a trade-off of
attentional and cognitive resources dedicated on the focal
task and other tasks that also require attention (Tomm &
Zhao, 2016). This corroborates with past research showing
that engagement with complex tasks can cause a failure to
notice highly salient events (Simons & Chabris, 1999), even
at the expense of personal safety (see Strayer, Drews, &
Johnson, 2003).
In the current study, we investigate how time scarcity
affects the online detection of information, and how time

Undergraduate students (N = 90) were recruited from the
Human Subject Pool at the Department of Psychology at the
University of British Columbia (UBC), and participated in
the experiment in exchange for course credit. All
participants provided informed consent to participate. All
experiments reported here were approved by the UBC
Behavioral Research Ethics Board. We conducted a power
analysis using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner,
2007), which showed that given an effect size of 0.6 (based
on our prior work, Tomm & Zhao, 2016), a minimum of 90
participants would be required to have 80% power to detect
the effect in our design.

Stimuli and Procedure
In the experiment, each participant was asked to solve a
series of puzzles on the computer. The puzzles were a total
of 50 trials of the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Raven,
2000). Each matrix appeared at the centre of a computer
screen. The bottom right corner of the matrix was missing,
and participants had to find the right piece that fits with the
general pattern in the matrix. Each participant was asked to
correctly solve the matrices to earn as many points as
possible. In each trial, participants were shown one Raven’s

3350

matrix, with the numbered pieces appearing below. The
response keys appeared in a vertical list on the left side of
the screen. In the top-left corner of the screen, the question
number and time remaining were displayed (see Figure 1).
Participants were not told of the total number of trials until
starting the first trial. To solve each matrix, participants
pressed a number key corresponding to the correct piece.

(Figure 2c). When accounting for the total amount of time
spent on the task, the time-poor participants scored higher
accuracy per minute than time-rich participants [t(88) =
8.09, p < .001, d = 1.71]. This result suggests that time
scarcity can cause a greater focus on the task at hand,
enhancing task performance within the time limit.

Participants in the time-poor condition almost unanimously
used their entire time budget (10 minutes) while participants
in the time-rich condition used less than half of their time
budget (16 minutes). Given this constraint, the time-poor
participants spent less time on the task overall compared to
time-rich participants [t(88) = 6.51, p < .001, d = 1.37]
(Figure 2a). The time-poor participants completed fewer
trials than the time-rich participants [t(88) = 4.71, p < .001,
d = .99] (Figure 2b).
Notably, there was marginal difference in accuracy on the
Raven’s Progressive Matrices between the time-poor and
the time-rich participants [t(88) = 1.69, p = .09, d = .36]

To manipulate time scarcity, participants were randomly
assigned with either a rich time budget (they had 40 minutes
in total to solve the matrices; the time-rich condition, N =
45), or a poor time budget (they only had 10 minutes in total
to solve the matrices; the time-poor condition, N = 45).
Without explicit instruction or prompting, a time-saving cue
appeared in the lower right part of the screen during the
experiment. Specifically, on even-numbered trials starting
from trial #24, the cue appeared on the screen stating: “This
question is not worth any points. Press ‘A’ to skip.” (see
Figure 1) Thus, 14 of the 50 trials were allowed to be
skipped without any loss of points. The cue appeared at the
same as the matrix for those trials, and remained on the
screen for 5000ms, and then disappeared. These trials
presented an opportunity to skip the question in order to
save time. Participants were not told anything about the cue.
We wanted to see if they were able to detect this message
during the experiment and skipped the even-numbered
questions from trial #24.

were exactly the same as those in Experiment 1a, except one
important change: the time-saving cue (i.e., the message to
skip even-numbered questions after trial #24) now appeared
directly underneath the Raven’s Progressive Matrix after
trial #24 for even-numbered questions (Figure 3).
If the neglect of the time-saving cue in Experiment 1a was
due to the spatial narrowing of attention under scarcity, we
would predict that the time-poor participants would be more
likely to notice the cue, because it was not close to the
central task. On the other hand, if the neglect of the timesaving cue was due to inattentional blindness, moving the
cue closer to the central task would not affect performance.

cue appeared right below the matrix.

Results and Discussion
Since in Experiment 1a, time scarcity influenced the
number of participants who skipped at least once, we
examined the same measure here again. We found that now
there was no statistical difference in the percent of
participants who skipped at least once [X2(1,90) = .71, p =
.40] (Figure 4a). Comparing Figure 4a to Figure 2e, the
time-rich participants were not influenced by the change in
the position of the cue, but the poor seemed to benefit from
the closer proximity of the cue to the central task. This
suggests that if the cue falls within the spatial scope of
attention, the time-poor participants could still take
advantage of the cue.

In this experiment, we reduced the spatial distance between

Examining the number of questions skipped, we found
that there was no significant difference in the average
number of questions skipped between the time-poor and the
time-rich participants [t(88) = 1.23, p = .22, d = .26] (Figure
2d). However, only 26.7% of the participants in the timepoor condition skipped at least once, and there were more
time-rich participants (48.9%) who skipped at least once
[X2(1,90) = 4.72, p = .03] (Figure 2e). This result suggests
that time scarcity caused a failure to use the time-saving cue
appearing on the bottom of the screen.
To control for the total number of trials completed, we
calculated skip efficiency as the number of questions
skipped divided by the number of possible questions that
could be skipped. There was no difference in skip efficiency
between the time-poor and the time-rich participants [t(88)
= .91, p = .36, d = .19] (Figure 2f).
Among those who skipped at least once, there was no
difference in the number of questions skipped between the
time-poor and the time-rich participants [t(31) = .89, p =
.38, d = .34] (Figure 2g). This means that if the participant
noticed the cue at least once, they were able to skip the same
number of questions, regardless of scarcity.
To measure retrospective recall of the time-saving cues,
we asked participants after completing the task during
debriefing to report whether they saw any messages
appearing on the screen during the task. We found that the
time-poor participants were less likely to report seeing the
cues than the time-rich participants [X2(1,84) = 3.81, p =
.05] (Figure 2h).
These results showed that fewer participants under time
scarcity skipped the questions at least once, and reported
seeing the cues, compared to time-rich participants. This
suggests that time scarcity may narrow attention to the
central task, while inducing a neglect of peripheral, even
beneficial information in the environment. An alternative
explanation is inattentional blindness, suggesting that the
time-poor participants were less able to attend to salient but
task-irrelevant information, than the time-rich participants.
To tease these two accounts apart, we conducted the next
experiment, probing whether scarcity alters the spatial scope
of attention, or the ability to notice salient stimulus.
Specifically, we manipulated the location of the time-saving
cue, and examined the likelihood of skipping questions as a
function of the spatial location of the cue under scarcity.

During debriefing, the time-poor participants were

participants in Experiment 1a (34% reported noticing the

to the time-poor participants in Experiment 1b (48%
reported noticing the cue). These results support the account
that scarcity narrows spatial attention to the focal task.

Experiment 2
Experiments 1a-c showed that time scarcity narrowed
attention on the focal task, resulting in the neglect of a timesaving cue which appeared in the peripheral during the
experiment. However, in daily life, we do not always have
cues in the external environment as reminders for certain
actions. Instead, we need to rely on internal cues from
memory that need to be activated at the right time to direct
actions. For example, in order to pick up groceries on the
way home from work, we must remember to turn at the right
intersection in order to go to the grocery store. This depends
on prospective memory, which is the ability to remember to
execute future actions based on previous instructions. Cues
for prospective memory are internal, and must be present in
mind in order to cue behavior at the right time (Graf, Uttl, &
Dixon, 2002; Loftus, 1971). In this experiment, we
examined how time scarcity affects prospective memory
performance.

Participants, Stimuli, and Procedure
Participants (N = 86) were recruited from the Human
Subject Pool at UBC, and participated in the experiment in
exchange for course credit. The stimuli and the procedure
were identical to those of Experiment 1a, but this time the
time-saving cue appeared in the bottom right corner of the
screen (Figure 5), which was even farther away from the
focal task than in Experiment 1a.

cue appeared far from the matrix, on the bottom right corner of the

Results and Discussion
We found that participants in both conditions failed to take
advantage of cue. There was no statistical difference in the
percent of participants who skipped at least once [X2(1,90) =
1.54, p = .21] (Figure 6a). During debriefing, there was no
difference in the likelihood to report seeing any messages
during the task between the participants in both conditions
[X2(1,87) = 2.70, p = .10] (Figure 6b). In fact, there was a
floor effect in both the time-poor and the time-rich
participants in skipping the questions or noticing the cue.
This suggests that when the cue was spatially far away from
the focal task, participants could not notice the cue,
regardless of scarcity.

Participants were asked to solve the same set of 50 Raven’s
Progressive Matrices used in Experiments 1a-c. As before,
participants were randomly assigned either a small time
budget (5 minutes; the time-poor condition), or a large time
budget (20 minutes; the time-rich condition). A critical
difference in this experiment was that the time-saving cue
never appeared in the experiment. Rather, all participants
were explicitly instructed at the start of the experiment the
following: “Even-numbered questions from number twentyfour on are not worth any points. You can skip these
questions without losing any points.” This instruction was
presented on paper to participants to read, and the
experimenter also read through these instructions with each
participant to maximize the comprehension of the
instruction. As before, the question number and remaining
time appeared in the top-left corner of the screen, and the
keys available for the participants to press were listed on the

3353

left side of the screen. Note that now the “A (skip)” key is
listed among the available keys and was listed for every
single question (Figure 7). There were no visual cues during
the experiment to remind participants which questions they
were allowed to skip. Thus, participants needed to
remember to use the opportunity to skip when the applicable
questions were reached.

participants who skipped at least once, there was no
difference in the number of questions skipped between the
time-poor and the time-rich participants [t(40) = .59, p =
.56, d = .19] (Figure 8g), or in skip efficiency [t(40) = .76, p
= .45, d = .26] (Figure 8h).

Participants in the time-poor condition almost unanimously
exhausted their time budgets, while participants in the timerich condition usually completed the experiment with some
time to spare (Figure 8a). The time-poor participants spent
less time solving the Raven’s Matrices than the time-rich
participants [t(88) = 13.33, p < .001, d = 2.81]. They also
completed significantly fewer trials than the time-rich
participants [t(88) = 10.14, p < .001, d = 2.14] (Figure 8b),
and were significantly less accurate [t(88) = 2.29, p = .02, d
= .48] (Figure 8c). When accounting for the total amount of
time spent on the task, the time-poor participants scored
higher accuracy per minute than time-rich participants [t(88)
= 9.53, p < .001, d = 2.01], suggesting that time scarcity

The time-poor participants on average skipped fewer
questions than the time-rich participants [t(88) = 2.52, p =
.01, d = .53] (Figure 8d). However, this result is likely
driven, at least in part, by the considerably smaller number
of questions completed by the time-poor participants.
Similarly, we found that fewer time-poor participants
skipped at least once compared to the time-rich participants
[X2(1,90) = 10.08, p < .01] (Figure 8e), but this could be due
to the smaller number of possible skips experienced by the
time-poor participants. Thus, we examined the skip
efficiency defined as the number of questions skipped
divided by the number of possible questions that could be
skipped experienced by the participant. We found that the
time-poor participants were less likely to skip than time-rich
participants (two time-poor participants were excluded from
this analysis due to failing to reach trial number twentyfour) [t(86) = 2.01, p = .05, d = .43] (Figure 8f). This
finding suggests that time scarcity impairs prospective

General Discussion
The goal of the present study was to examine how time
scarcity impacts attention and prospective memory. We
found that people under time scarcity were less likely to
take advantage of a time-saving cue that appeared peripheral
to the focal task (Experiment 1a), but nonetheless performed
well on the focal task under the time constraint. This
suggests that people under time scarcity are ironically less
likely to notice opportunities to save time. This effect could
be explained by a narrowing of spatial attention to the focal
task (Experiments 1b & 1c). In the absence of an external
cue, participants under time scarcity were less likely to
remember to skip questions in the future (Experiment 2),
suggesting that they failed to retrieve a cue from memory to
execute actions at the right time.
These findings were particularly problematic for people
under time scarcity because the attentional neglect of timesaving opportunities or the failure to remember to save time
could be detrimental, perpetuating the condition of scarcity
and creating a vicious cycle of scarcity. These cognitive
impairments could explain a range of counter-productive
behaviors observed in the low-income individuals, such as
forgetting to follow instructions, or not signing up for public
benefit programs. In addition, prospective memory errors
can be seen by others as an indication of incompetence of
the poor (Graf, 2012). The present findings instead attribute
the memory failures not to the poor individuals themselves
but to the condition of scarcity. The current study provides
useful implications for designing policies and programs to
mitigate the impact of scarcity, such as the use of reminders,
automatic enrolment, or setting the right default, to reduce
the attentional and memory burdens in the poor.
