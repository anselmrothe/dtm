Abstract
Distributional learning research has established that humans
can track the frequencies of sequentially presented stimuli in
order to infer the probabilities of upcoming events (e.g., Hasher
& Zacks, 1984). Here, we set out to explore anticipation of a
stimulus after implicit distributional learning. We hypothesize
that as people learn the category frequency information
implicitly, response times will scale according to the relative
frequency of the stimulus category. Twelve adult participants
viewed photographs of faces, tools, and buildings while
performing a simple classification task. We found that response
times significantly decreased with greater frequencies in the
distribution of stimulus categories. This result suggested that
distributional information about the internal representations of
the stimuli could be learned and indicated the possibility that
participants anticipated the stimuli proportional to the
probability of the category appearing and thereby reduced
response times for the more frequent categories.

Introduction
Although complicated and dynamic, our sensory
environment contains regularities distributed both spatially
and temporally. Previous studies have shown that humans
can acquire information from a probabilistic structure, and
they are able to predict the upcoming stimulus using
distributional knowledge. In this study, we used behavioral
methods to investigate anticipation prior to object
classification after distributional learning of the object
category frequencies.
People are known to be sensitive to the distributional
information, and they are able to actively use this information
to make complex inferences, such as identifying underlying
structures in sequences. Explicit probabilistic information
can aid human decision-making in many situations (Arkes,
Dawes, & Christensen, 1986; Wiggs, 1993; Lin, Kung, &
Lin, 1997). In addition to explicit distributional learning, in
fact, it is well established in the fields of human development,
language acquisition, attention, and perception that people
are sensitive to implicit distributional information (e.g.,
Attneave, 1953; Fiser & Aslin, 2002; Hasher & Zacks, 1984;
Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996; Tryk,1968; Turk-Browne,
Scholl, Chun, & Johnson, 2009; Pelucchi, Hay, & Saffran,

2009). In these studies, distributional information was not
explicitly provided to participants, but the results showed that
participants could track the stimulus input to infer its
underlying causal structure and therefore make accurate
predictions or judgments about which stimuli potentially fit
or violate this structure. Thus, even when these statistical
relationships are not explicitly presented and the stimuli are
too numerous to be explicitly counted, people can discover
an accurate distributional model of the input.
Particularly, classification tasks have been used to test
implicit distributional learning (Forster & Chambers, 1973;
Stanners, Forbach & Headley, 1971; Stanners, Jastrzembski,
& Westbrook, 1975; Whaley, 1978). Classifying responses
can reflect distributional learning processes, as learned items
can be recognized and discriminated from other items faster
than unfamiliar items can. For example, Whaley (1978)
found that response times for word and non-word
classification were substantially faster with high-frequency
initial and final consonants than for words with lowfrequency consonants in initial or final position or both.
Although in the context of language, this finding shed lights
on the correlation between implicit distributional learning
and response times, and it demonstrated the methodology of
using a classification task to test this correlation.
Response time has been used to measure anticipation in
many studies (Haith, Hazan, & Goodman, 1988; Hinrichs &
Krainz, 1970; Todorovic, van Ede, Maris, & de Lange, 2011;
Turk-Browne, Scholl, Johnson, & Chun, 2010, Poulton,
1950). Some of these studies have found that when
participants were instructed to predict the upcoming stimulus,
response times were faster for correct predictions than for
incorrect predictions (Bernstein & Reese, 1965; Hinrichs et
al., 1970). This finding suggests that anticipation of an
upcoming stimulus influences the response time in the
subsequent trial.
However, the effect of adult observers’ use of implicit
distributional learning on anticipation of the category of an
upcoming stimulus remains largely unexplored. Most studies
have focused on effect of frequency information about
stimulus-stimulus association (e.g. Conway & Christiansen,
2005; Kirkham, Slemmer, Johnson, 2002; O’Brien &
Raymond, 2012; Olson & Chun, 2001; Turk-Browne, Jungé,
Scholl, 2005), and little research have looked into the effect
of the overall distributional information about the internal

1752

representation of the stimuli (e.g. the categorical
representation of the object).
Here, we aimed to establish evidence for anticipatory
representations of the category of the upcoming stimulus
emerging from distributional learning. Turk-Browne et al.
(2010) investigated implicit anticipation triggered by
probabilistic information. Their behavioral result showed that
when the participants observed and made classification
responses to every trial, the participants reacted faster to the
trials that can be predicted from their immediate preceded
trials. Based on this finding, in the experiment, we measured
participants’ anticipation of an object category by measuring
the response times in a sequential classification task. We
examined the anticipatory effects of the underlying
distribution and predicted that response times for
classification would decrease with greater category
frequencies, suggesting that as people learned the category
distributional information implicitly, anticipation was scaled
according to the probability of the category appearing.

Methods
Participants
Twelve participants were recruited (mean age = 20 years; SD
= 1.7 years; 7 females, 5 males) and were compensated $10
per hour. All participants were undergraduate students at the
University of Rochester. All participants reported being
right-hand dominant. The experiment took around 45 minutes
to complete. The study procedures were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the University of Rochester,
and participants received an informed consent document
prior to the study.
Materials
We chose three categories of stimuli: faces, buildings, and
tools. Each category has specific brain areas that reliably
respond to one of these categories but not the others (Epstein
& Kanwisher, 1998; Kanwisher, McDermott, & Chun, 1997;
Chao & Martin, 2000). The images from each of these
categories were grey-scaled and edited to be the same size
(640 × 480 pixels) using Preview software in Mac OSX. The
images appeared in the middle of a 27ʺ iMAC monitor with
1920 × 1080 resolution. The images appeared in the middle
of the screen against a white background. Face images were
acquired from the Chicago Face Database (Ma, Correl, &
Wittenbrink, 2015); Building images were downloaded by
Google Image search with the keywords “building” and
“house”; Tool images were obtained from the BOSS database
(Brodeur, Dionne-Dostie, Montreuil, & Lepage M, 2010).
The frequency of each category (60%, 30%, or 10%) was
counterbalanced across six different distributional conditions
using Latin Squares (Winer, 1962). This manipulation
counterbalanced carryover effects between conditions and
ensured that participants see each of the conditions in the
study. We chose 60%, 30%, and 10% as frequencies
considering the number of trials in each block (30 trials) and
condition (90 trials). These frequencies produce integer
instead of the decimal number of trials in each condition. The

complete information about these six conditions is shown in
Table 1.
Three adjacent buttons on the computer keyboard were
marked as “F”, “H” and “T”. To exclude the motor-related
confounds that were the interest of this study, the key
mapping was counterbalanced across subjects. Subjects were
asked to always use the same three fingers (index, middle,
and ring fingers) for the same keys.

protocol of first three trials in one condition. After
participants read the instructions, images appeared on the
screen and participants responded accordingly by pressing
corresponding buttons. A score would appear above the
picture after the participant pressed a button.
Procedure
Subjects were asked to perform a simple classification task.
The presentation of stimuli was programmed using
MATLAB Psychophysics toolbox (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner,
Brainard, Pelli, Ingling, & Murray, 2007; Pelli, 1997). The
experiment took place in a behavioral testing cubicle. During
each condition, the participants were instructed to press a
designated key to indicate the category of each presented
stimulus. A score was given based on the reaction time

1753

immediately after each response (zero for inaccurate or
missing trials), and a total score was presented after each
condition. The scores were presented in order to provide
feedback and motivate participants to give faster and more
accurate responses, and they were not used in the analysis.
Stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA; 2000, 4000, and 6000 ms)
was varied to prevent participants from predicting when the
next stimulus would appear on the screen. Each trial had a
fixed image duration of 1000 ms, and the image would not
disappear after a response was recorded. Inter-trial interval
(ITI) varied based on the SOA of that trial. Each subject went
through all 6 conditions. Each condition had 3 blocks, and
each block displayed 30 images. In total 90 images were
presented in each condition, and 540 images in the whole
experiment. The breaks between blocks were 15000 ms, and
the breaks between conditions were two minutes. Instructions
between each condition were designed to cue the participants
to the new distributional information of the next condition:
“Thank you for finishing the task. Please take a short break.
A new but similar task will start in two minutes.” The
illustration of the experiment experimental protocol of first
three trials in one condition is shown in Figure 1.

Results
In total, 6480 responses were recorded (M = 521 ms; SD =
107 ms; Accuracy = 0.948). For analysis, we excluded the
trials with incorrect responses or no responses. And across all
participants, 336 out of 6480 trials (0.05%) were excluded for
this reason. Paired two-tailed t-tests showed that for all
twelve subjects, mean response times of block 2 for each
condition were significantly less than those of block 1,
t=2.255, p=0.038<0.05; average response times of block 3 for
each condition were significantly less than those of block 1,
t=2.585, p=0.019<0.05; but average response times of block
3 for each condition were not significantly less than average
response times of block 2, t=-0.683, p=0.504. It is possible
that subjects needed several trials to acquire the distributional
information of the current condition and to replace the
carryover distributional information from previous
conditions. And after obtaining the current distributional
information, the participants were able to perform the task
using this knowledge. Thus, we excluded all trials from block
1 of each condition. The analyses only contained correct
responses from block 2 and block 3. Mean, standard

deviation, and accuracy of response times for each category
in each frequency are shown in Table 2.
Using linear mixed-effects models in R, we compared
response times for different stimuli in each distribution. We
first used a 3-way interaction model (SOA × category ×
frequency), but did not find any significant 3-way interaction.
Instead, a reduced 2-way interaction model (category ×
frequency + SOA × category + SOA × frequency) was
estimated and reported in Table 3. Face was chosen as the
arbitrary baseline category by R to prevent multi-collinearity
in the indicator variables for the stimulus category.
SOA did not significantly interact with Frequency, and
only marginally varied across Category (p = 0.07). A main
effect of SOA was also significant (p = 0.006). Therefore,
although SOA was not a variable of particular interest, we
retained it in the model to control for the possible effects of
the pre-stimulus waiting period on the anticipatory
representation and thus on the change in response times.
Similarly, no main effect for Category was found, but we
retained this term due to its significant interaction with
Frequency (see below) and to account for Category-specific
differences in baseline response rate (e.g., participants
responded to faces faster than tools and buildings).
The main effect of frequency was highly significant (p <
0.001), consistent with our hypothesis that response times
would differ as a function of the stimulus distribution. The
post-hoc paired t-tests on subject-level mean response times
found that response times indeed significantly decrease as the
frequency of the stimulus category increased (60% vs. 30%:
t(11) = -6.08, p < 0.001; 30% vs. 10%: t(11) = -5.01, p <
0.001).
The interaction between frequency and condition was also
significant, so we examined the frequency effects specific to
each category of the stimuli. We found that within each of the
categories, response times generally decreased as its
frequency increased (see Figure 2 for the summary of tests),
although many of these tests would not survive correction for
multiple comparisons. With the results from the linear mixedeffect models and the t-tests, we can conclude that this effect
is in line with our hypothesis that participants’ response times
reduced proportionally to the increasing frequency of the
category.
We also looked at the estimated slopes for the frequency ×
category interaction in the model (Figure 3), which was

Discussion
In this study, we showed behavioral evidence that response
times decreased with the higher frequency of occurrence of
the upcoming stimulus. The evidence consisted of lower
response times for categories with the higher frequencies of
occurrence in the input as opposed to the category with lower
frequencies of occurrence. Higher probability could be
reasonably more predictable and therefore facilitated

classification response and reduced response times. This
result could be explained if the response to each category
engaged anticipatory processes that completed with the
overall probability information across all categories. The
results were in line with our hypothesis that the anticipatory
representation acquired through distributional learning
affects responses in a classification task by allowing faster
response times according to the frequency of a category
appearing.
Previous studies have been focused on frequency
information learning between specific stimulus-stimulus
associations (e.g. Conway et al. 2005; Kirkham et al. 2002;
O’Brien & Raymond, 2012; Olson & Chun, 2001; TurkBrowne et al. 2005). However, no study, to our knowledge,
has looked into the effect on distributional information about
the internal representations of the stimuli. And here we
present robust evidence that implicit distributional
information about the internal representations of the stimuli
could be learned, subsequently facilitated responses to trials
of the more frequent category, and therefore caused the
anticipation effect.
We also found that participants could learn new
distributional information and this new information could
override the previously learned distribution relatively quickly
(i.e., within 30 trials or one block of the experiment).
Although our finding gives a rather coarse estimate of
distributional learning efficiency due to the use of response
times as an index of learning with relatively low resolution,
this result provides strong evidence for on-line learning,
because the participants were required to give a response on
every trial. Some previous studies relied on off-line learning
tests so that they have not been able to study the speed of the
distributional learning. Other studies that looked into the online learning of probabilistic information also suggested that
probabilistic information could be obtained quickly (Abla,
Katahira, & Okanoya, 2008; Turk-Browne et al., 2009),
although these studies used probabilistic information about
stimulus-stimulus associations instead of the overall
distributional pattern of the stimuli.
Additionally, results showed that building and tool
categories were less affected by frequency than faces were.
Humans are highly experienced at recognizing faces for
evolutionary purposes (Leopold & Rhodes, 2010; Little,
Jones, & DeBruine, 2010; Sheehan & Nachman, 2014), and
therefore it is possible that human faces can be more quickly
recognized and distinguished than other categories can. The
perception of faces might have a lower minimal response
time in the high-frequency condition, and thus participants’
performance for faces was far faster than the other conditions
at the 60% frequency.
At the beginning of the paper, we intended to measure the
anticipation of the probabilistically distributed category using
comparisons between response times. The above results,
using response times as the indication of the anticipation
effect, showed that the participants successfully learned and
used the distributional information. However, although
response time has been used in some studies as an indication

1755

of anticipation (Haith et al., 1988; Hinrichs et al., 1970;
Todorovic et al., 2011; Poulton, 1950), it does not directly
measure the neural response to anticipatory effect after
distributional learning. It is possible that the categories were
also directly encoded or primed at relative magnitudes in the
brain as a function of frequency, producing this response time
effect. This promising result from this behavioral experiment
points to the possibility of a future experiment using
neuroimaging techniques (e.g., fMRI) to test the hypothesis
that probabilistically weighted brain activity also corresponds
to the category frequencies, and can be found in the neural
activity immediately prior to each trial.
Further studies can combine our behavioral results with the
ability to detect categorical specific activation using fMRI to
explore the neural basis of anticipation after implicit
distributional learning. The adaptive nature of human
categorization assumes that categorization reflects the
optimal estimates of the probability of unseen features of
objects (Anderson & Milson, 1989). Turk-Browne et al.
(2010) identified a neural mediator of anticipation for stimuli
as a consequence of implicit distributional learning of paired
and unpaired images using fMRI. A region of interest
analysis of this study found increased activation of the
category-specific brain area from the anticipation of that
category and suppressed activation of the area when the
predictive stimulus was from another category. These
findings suggest that category-specific cortical activation due
to implicit perceptual anticipation after implicit probabilistic
learning is detectable in the category-specific brain regions
using fMRI.
In sum, our study gave behavioral evidence that
anticipation for the category of the upcoming stimulus is
proportional to the distribution over all the categories. In the
future, we hope to see neuroimaging experiment that shows
anticipation after distributional learning can be measured in
brain activity, and the representation is proportional to the
learned distribution.
