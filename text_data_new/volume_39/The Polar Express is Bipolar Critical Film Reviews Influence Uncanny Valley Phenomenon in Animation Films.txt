Although the UV is apparently not triggered by all
artificial-to-human continua, it could still occur under some
specific conditions. Accumulating evidence has shown that
negative evaluations can be elicited by a mismatch between
artificial and realistic features (Seyama & Nagayama, 2007;
MacDorman & Chattopadhyay, 2016) or by categorization
difficulty (Burleigh & Schoenherr, 2015; Yamada, Kawabe,
& Ihaya, 2013; however, see MacDorman &
Chattopadhyay, 2016). Almost all of this evidence comes
from rigorous manipulations of CG and human faces. A few
other studies using naturalistic – and plausibly more
ecologically valid – stimuli have provided evidence for the
UV in pictures of prosthetic hands (Poliakoff, Beach, Best,
Howard, & Gowen, 2013) and real-world robot faces
(Mathur & Reichling, 2016).

Abstract
Previous research suggests that semi-realistic animation films
such as The Polar Express are representative of the uncanny
valley (UV) hypothesis, which predicts that highly humanlike artificial characters can appear eerie. In the present study,
we investigated the extent to which critical film reviews can
influence the perceived eeriness of such films. The reviews
were adopted from authentic ones and expressed either
negative or positive attitudes towards the animation
techniques. Audiovisual speech asynchrony, which is known
to induce eeriness, was included as an objective manipulation.
Our results showed large review tone effects for both implicit
and explicit eeriness evaluations. In contrast, speech
asynchrony failed to elicit significant effects. These results
demonstrate that critical film reviews representing opposite
attitudinal poles can elicit consistent changes in the viewers’
evaluations of semi-realistic animations. The present findings
cannot, however, be taken as evidence against the UV
hypothesis itself in computer-generated characters.

Uncanny Valley and Animated Film Characters

Keywords: Uncanny Valley hypothesis; anthropomorphism;
social influence; animation films

Introduction
Realistic computer-generated (CG) characters are
commonly used in lieu of human actors when creating social
signal stimuli for neurocognitive experiments. Although this
practice has several advantages such as the ease of creating
and manipulating stimuli, it is conceivable that subtle flaws
in highly realistic CG characters could elicit unintended
negative reactions in human participants. The Uncanny
Valley (UV) hypothesis predicted such reactions already in
the 1970s. The original hypothesis suggested that observing
highly realistic robots or other mechanical devices can elicit
negative feelings characterized by eeriness and lack of
familiarity (Mori, 1970/2012).

Empirical Evidence for Uncanny Valley
Although the UV hypothesis is compelling and it seems to
have plentiful anecdotal evidence (see below), empirical
evidence for its existence is still elusive (Kätsyri, Förger,
Mäkäräinen, & Takala, 2015; S. Wang, Lilienfeld, &
Rochat, 2015). A lack of commonly agreed-upon
operationalization is a fundamental problem for testing the
hypothesis. According to a conservative interpretation, any
artificial-to-human stimulus continuum should elicit a nonlinear evaluation curve in which the most negative
evaluations occur at levels preceding the full degree of
human-likeness. The bulk of empirical studies have,
however, shown that increasingly human-like stimuli simply
tend to elicit more positive evaluations in a linear manner
(Kätsyri et al., 2015).

The UV hypothesis was rediscovered at the beginning of the
present millennium (e.g., MacDorman, 2005) and has since
received increasing research interest. First fully computeranimated films with deliberately realistic characters,
including Final Fantasy (Aida, Lee, Sakai, Sakaguchi, &
Sakakibara, 2001) and The Polar Express (Goetzman,
Starkey, Teitler, & Zemeckis, 2004), were released roughly
around the same time. Perhaps not coincidentally, these and
some other animation films have been adopted as anecdotal
examples of the UV, with frequent citations in scientific
research reports (e.g., Piwek, McKay, & Pollick, 2014) and
popular scientific magazines (e.g., Spinney, 2017).
It seems plausible that semi-realistic animated film
characters could appear eerie in the sense of the UV. Early
computer graphics methods in particular tended to suffer
from shortcomings in modeling light reflections from the
skin and eyes, for example (e.g., Wechsler, 2002). These
and other subtle flaws on otherwise quite realistic characters
could elicit sufficient featural mismatch to make them
appear uncanny. In general, semi-realistic animated film
characters stand out from the intentionally caricatured and
exaggerated characters that are the norm in traditional
animation (Kaba, 2012).
To our best knowledge, semi-realistic animated film
characters, cartoonish animated film characters, and human
actors have been explicitly compared with each other only
recently in our own previous study (Kätsyri, Mäkäräinen, &
Takala, 2017). The results showed that semi-realistic
characters are considered more eerie and selected more
often as representative examples of the UV hypothesis than
cartoonish characters or human actors. These results suggest
that semi-realistic animated film characters capture some
aspects of the UV hypothesis.

Critical Film Reviews and Uncanny Valley

Method

Semi-realistic animation films, which are a rare exception
among the traditional computer-animated films, have
attracted a mixed but predominantly negative critical
reception. Some of the published reviews have explicitly
characterized the realistic characters as “soulless” and
“creepy” (e.g., Savlov, 2004). In the present study, we
explore the extent to which this kind of critical reviews can
influence the evaluation of animated characters in semirealistic films.
A research tradition in social psychology has shown that
individuals’ attitudes and behavior are influenced by those
of others (Bohner & Dickel, 2011). In one form of social
influence, credible information from others is accepted as
valid evidence about reality (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955).
Perceived expertise on the subject matter has long been
considered as one source of credibility (Kelman, 1956). On
the other hand, negative attitudes are known to exert greater
influence than equally intense positive attitudes (Cacioppo,
Gardner, & Berntson, 1997). An excellent demonstration of
this is that negative peer reviews exert greater influence than
positive reviews on individuals’ attitudes towards consumer
products (Lee, Park, & Han, 2008). Taken together, negative
reviews from film experts should exert an influence.
Consistently, negative film reviews are known to elicit
decreased box profit especially during early presentation
weeks (Basuroy, Chatterjee, & Ravid, 2003).

Present Study
The present study aims to compare the effects of critical
film reviews and objective differences between films on the
UV phenomenon in semi-realistic animation films. When
comparing small sets of individual films (as in Kätsyri et al.,
2017), confound effects cannot be fully excluded. Instead, in
the present study, we decided to manipulate audiovisual
speech asynchrony in the same set of films. Audiovisual
speech asynchrony was selected as the objective
manipulation since a previous study has shown that it elicits
eeriness in virtual characters (Tinwell, Grimshaw, & Nabi,
2015). Increased eeriness was observed at a 200-ms
asynchrony at the earliest, and it was more pronounced
when the auditory stream preceded rather than followed the
visual stream. These findings are consistent with
psychophysics literature, in which simultaneity judgments
for audiovisual speech occur roughly in the time frame of
–130 ms (audio first) to +220 ms (vision first) (Conrey &
Pisoni, 2006).
Participants were asked both to rate the eeriness of films
immediately after viewing them (implicit evaluations) and
to score how representative each film was of UV after
having received full debriefing (explicit evaluations). Our
main hypotheses were:
H1: Majority negative reviews will elicit higher implicit
and explicit eeriness than majority positive reviews.
H2: Asynchronous audiovisual speech will elicit higher
implicit and explicit eeriness than synchronous audiovisual
speech.

Participants
Forty participants (20 women) with a mean age of 29.7
years (SD = 8.5) took part in the study. All participants were
native Finnish speakers with a good command of written
English. Three participants who scored poorly in a postexperimental reading comprehension test were replaced
with new participants. Participants reported having normal
hearing, normal (or corrected) visual acuity, and no history
of dyslexia. Participants were compensated with two movie
tickets. Study protocol was approved by the Aalto
University Research Ethics committee.

Stimuli
Animation Film Scenes Stimuli were four film scenes from
animation films Final Fantasy (Aida et al., 2001), The Polar
Express (Goetzman et al., 2004), Beowulf (Rapke, Starkey,
& Zemeckis, 2007), and Tintin (Jackson, Kennedy, &
Spielberg, 2011). Films were selected on the basis of our
previous evaluation (Kätsyri et al., 2017). All films were
fully computer-animated and used motion-capture
techniques for character animation (most character motions
were captured from real actors). Film scenes were extracted
from official DVD releases, depicted spoken dialogue, and
did not contain violence or nudity. These copyrighted
materials were presented under an external license.
Audiovisual Speech Synchrony Original audiovisual
tracks for the predominantly spoken film scenes were used
for the synchronous speech condition. For the asynchronous
condition, auditory stream in each film scene was modified
to precede the visual stream by 200 ms.
Film Reviews For each film, six fictional but plausible film
reviews (three positive and three negative) were created. For
authenticity, all reviews were displayed in English.
Available reviews were first extracted from Metacritic
database (http://www.metacritic.com). Brief statements
expressing positive and negative attitudes towards
animation techniques were then extracted and modified to
produce an initial set of 12 reviews (half positive). These
reviews were evaluated by 19 additional participants for
expressed attitude (−4 very negative to +4 very positive).
Negative and positive reviews were clearly differentiated
(M = −2.1 and +2.6, SD = 1.2 and 0.8), F(1, 18) = 114.95, p
< .001, ηp2 = .87.
Final selected stimuli were three positive and three
negative reviews with roughly similar lengths (M = 82 and
79 words) and similar mean ratings across films. The
reviews focused on either specific visual features (e.g., “[…]
their eyes, supposedly the windows to the soul, are more
often dead than alive”) or the overall impression generated
by highly realistic animations (e.g., “[…] the soft-edged,
photorealistic style – suspended somewhere between liveaction and animation, fairy tale and reality – feels entirely
appropriate in this context”).

Procedure
Film preference evaluation was used as a distractor task to
avoid making the true study objectives too obvious.
Specifically, participants were explained that the study
aimed to investigate the effects of critical film reviews on
attitudes and consumer behavior. Full debriefing was given
at the end of the study.
Participants were assigned randomly to the conditions of a
4 (group) × 2 (majority review tone: negative, positive) ×
2 (speech synchrony: asynchronous, synchronous) mixed
model design. Majority review tone and speech synchrony
were counterbalanced with films using a 4 × 4 Latin square
as shown in Table 1. Participants were asked to read film
reviews carefully and told that a memory task would follow
the evaluation. Each trial proceeded as follows:
 Title and a brief description of the film were presented
with a minimum reading time of 20 s.
 Four reviews were presented (min. 10 s per each). For the
majority negative/positive condition, three reviews were
negative/positive and one was of the opposite valence.
Reviews were paired randomly with fictional reviewer
names (half female) and well-known magazine titles.
 An overview of the film scene was presented (min. 20 s).
 The movie scene was played back (164 s to 182 s).
 The participant answered a series of self-report questions.

Eeriness (Implicit) and Human-likeness For eeriness,
participants rated whether the characters appeared eerie,
creepy, and strange (good reliability: α = 0.84). Although
not included in any hypothesis, human-likeness scale was
also included because it is a focal dimension of the UV
(Mori, 1970/2012). Participants were asked to rate whether
the characters appeared realistic, cartoonish, and similar to
real people (adequate reliability: α = 0.71).
Representativeness (Explicit Eeriness) After finishing the
film evaluation task, participants received a full debriefing
of the experiment and the UV hypothesis. Participants were
then given four plastic cards depicting the four animation
films and asked to place these cards on a cardboard
depending on how representative the films were of the UV
(left side: not at all, right side: perfectly). Responses were
scored from 0 to 100 based on the cards’ physical positions.

Analysis
Data were subjected to a mixed-design GLM analysis in
SPSS (version 24). Effect sizes were quantified using partial
η2 values and classified as large (η2 ≥ .14), medium (η2 ≥
.06), or small (η2 ≥ .01) based on Cohen’s (1992) guidelines.

Results
Manipulation Checks

The experiment was carried out on a desktop computer
running Psychtoolbox (Brainard, 1997) for Matlab. Film
stimuli were displayed on a 24” wide-screen display (Eizo
ColorEdge CG241W) at horizontal resolution of 1024 pixels
and vertical resolution depending on aspect ratio (424 to 548
pixels). Participants were seated 80 cm from the display.
Auditory sound tracks were standardized at –5 dB and
played on closed earphones at a loud but comfortable level.
The whole experiment took approximately 60-90 mins.

After the experiment, participants were asked to read 12
review statements for each film, and to tell whether they had
read these reviews during the experiment (yes/no).
Statements included four correct and eight incorrect options
and an equal number of positive and negative reviews.
Recognition performance, as indexed by d’ sensitivity score
(Stevens & Pashler, 2002), was well above chance level (M
= 1.47, SD = 0.59), t(39) = 15.80, p < .001, showing that
participants had attended and comprehended the reviews.

Dependent Variables

Negative Reviews

Film Preference For attitude towards the film (cf.
Voorveld, 2011), participants rated whether they enjoyed
each film, were content with it, and found it interesting. This
scale had a good internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.96).
For consumption intent (cf. A. Wang, 2006), participants
rated whether they would like to see the full film (again if
seen), recommend it to a friend, and pay for seeing it (good
reliability: α = 0.91). These and all other ratings were given
on a 7-step Likert scale ranging from total disagreement (1)
to total agreement (7).

As can be seen in Table 2, majority review tone elicited
significant effects for all dependent variables. Supporting
H1, majority negative reviews elicited higher eeriness
ratings and representativeness scores than majority positive
reviews. In the distractor task, majority negative reviews
elicited decreased film attitude and consumption intent
ratings. Human-likeness ratings were decreased for majority
negative review reviews. Review tone had a medium effect
for film attitude and a large effect for all other variables.

Speech Asynchrony
As shown in Table 3, speech synchrony failed to elicit
significant main effects on eeriness, representativeness, or
any other variable. Asynchrony elicited slightly higher
representativeness scores than synchrony; however, this
effect was small and clearly non-significant. Hence, the
results did not support hypothesis H2.

Interactions
Fig. 1 illustrates interaction effects between review tone and
speech synchrony. Visual inspection suggests that review
effects for some variables were qualified by an interaction
with speech synchrony. Consistently, significant and large
interaction effects were observed for film attitude, F(1, 36)
= 7.05, p = .012, ηp2 = .16, consumption intent, F(1, 36) =
6.42, p = .016, ηp2 = .15, and human-likeness, F(1, 36) =
7.59, p = .009, ηp2 = .17. Simple effect tests revealed that for
these variables, negative reviews elicited lower ratings than
positive reviews only in the asynchronous condition (p ≤
.001, ηp2 ≥ .254). Importantly, interaction effects were not
significant for eeriness, F(1, 36) < 1, p = .643, ηp2 = .01, or
representativeness, F(1, 36) = 1.21, p = .278, ηp2 = .03.
Hence, H1 was not affected by this interaction.

Confounds
The following confound effects were tested and excluded
using mixed model analyses (Hoffman & Rovine, 2007):
previous familiarity (film seen or not seen), awareness of
UV, awareness of review manipulation, and awareness of
asynchrony manipulation. A mixed model equivalent to
GLM was first specified, and confounds were then added
and tested individually. The pattern of significant results
was not changed by the inclusion of any tested confound
into the model.
Awareness variables were derived from a semi-structured
interview conducted the end of the experiment. Briefly, UV
awareness meant that participants (18%) had heard about
the UV hypothesis, were able to explain it correctly, and
associated it with this experiment. For review awareness,
participants (30%) noticed that films were preceded
unequally by positive and negative reviews, were able to
choose which films received majority positive/negative
reviews, and were aware of the manipulation. For
asynchrony awareness, participants (30%) mentioned
audiovisual asynchrony spontaneously and were aware of
the manipulation. Notably, only 8% of participants were
able to choose asynchronous films correctly, however.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to provide an objective
comparison of the effects of critical reviews and objective
differences (audiovisual speech synchrony or asynchrony)
on the UV phenomenon in semi-realistic animation films.
We hypothesized that critical film reviews focusing on the
appearance of realistic animation technologies would exert
an influence on both implicitly and explicitly evaluated
eeriness. Indeed, our results showed that review tone
(majority positive or negative) elicited large effects both on
eeriness ratings given immediately after film viewing
(implicit evaluations) and representativeness scores given
after full debriefing of the UV (explicit evaluations).
Unexpectedly, audiovisual speech asynchrony failed to elicit
significant effects.
The present results demonstrate that social influence
(Bohner & Dickel, 2011) originating from critical reviews
can exert a large influence on the subjective eeriness of
semi-realistic animated film characters. Results from
explicit evaluations are particularly important because they
demonstrate that critical reviews can affect individuals’
attitudes specifically in the UV context. A closer inspection
of the results suggests that participants did not consider the
animation films as particularly eerie: 95% confidence
interval for the overall eeriness ratings was [2.7, 3.3] on the
7-step scale (i.e., below midpoint) and for the overall
representativeness scores [8.1, 10.5] on the visual scale from
0 to 100. In the absence of strong effects in the stimuli,
participants may have relied on information from the film
reviews instead.
Although not predicted beforehand, majority negative
reviews also elicited lower human-likeness ratings than
majority positive reviews – but only in film scenes with
asynchronous audiovisual speech dialogue. This result
differs clearly from eeriness evaluations, which were not
sensitive to the interaction between review tone and
synchrony. This suggests that review effects were more
robust for evaluated eeriness than for evaluated humanlikeness.
The failure to find significant effects for the 200-ms
audiovisual speech asynchrony is surprising given that such
delay should be noticeable on human faces (Conrey &
Pisoni, 2006) and elicit eeriness in virtual characters as well

2347

(Tinwell et al., 2015). We note that several participants
(30%) commented spontaneously upon asynchrony in the
films even though much fewer (8%) were actually able to
identify which films were truly asynchronous. A possible
explanation for this discrepancy is that animated lip
movements were sufficiently inaccurate to begin with in
some of the films so that additional delay had little or no
effect on the perceived asynchrony. It is also possible that
asynchrony effects may have been concealed by the stronger
review tone effects. In partial support, secondary
evaluations – but not eeriness evaluations – were affected by
the interaction between review tone and asynchrony.
A significant limitation of the present study is that, in the
absence of statistically significant effect for asynchronous
speech, the magnitude of critical review effect cannot be
meaningfully interpreted. Hence, the present results can tell
us that critical film reviews exert a large influence on the
perceived eeriness of semi-realistic animated film
characters, but it cannot tell us whether these effects are
weaker or stronger than those elicited by genuine physical
differences in the stimuli.
The present results are nevertheless relevant for the UV
phenomenon because semi-realistic animated film
characters have already been linked to this phenomenon
previously (Kätsyri et al., 2017). Methodological limitations
in this previous study warrant some caution in interpreting
the findings; for example, eeriness ratings were close to
minimum for all film characters. It is particularly clear that
semi-realistic animation films do not elicit any such
aversion that could be implicitly or explicitly likened to
human corpses or zombies (cf. Mori, 1970/2012).
Nevertheless, semi-realistic animated characters received
slightly but statistically significantly higher eeriness ratings
and were considered more often as being representative of
the UV hypothesis than other types of films. Hence, these
previous findings provide support for subtle UV effects in
semi-realistic animated film characters. The present results
add to this by demonstrating that such effects can also be
elicited by critical film reviews. It should be emphasized
that the present study did not aim to “find” the UV for
animated characters, as this was already done previously.
Precisely for the same reason, the present results should
be considered meaningful even though the review effect was
not tested for cartoonish animated characters or real human
actors. In fact, the present film reviews that focused
explicitly on the disadvantages of realistic animation
techniques could not have been paired with any other types
of films, at least not without arousing suspicion in the study
participants. Although fictitious negative reviews focusing
on the disadvantages of traditional animation could possibly
have been created, it is likely that such stimuli would have
been considered implausible as this kind of reviews do not
appear to exist in reality.
Taken together, the present findings demonstrate that
critical film reviews representing opposite attitudinal poles –
negative or positive – towards realistic animation techniques
can elicit consistent changes in individuals’ evaluations.

In this sense, the UV phenomenon in semi-realistic
animation films could be characterized as being bipolar.
The present findings should obviously be interpreted with
caution when it comes to explaining the complexities of
attitude formation in real life. Allowing some speculation, it
is possible that critical film reviews might have contributed
to the wide-spread adoption of specific animation films as
anecdotal examples of the UV. The present results
empathetically cannot be taken to mean that the UV would
be just a media phenomenon, however. First, the present
study does not allow comparing the effects of critical film
reviews to genuine differences between stimuli. Second,
empirical evidence for the UV phenomenon has already
begun to accumulate, especially from studies with featurally
mismatching (Seyama & Nagayama, 2007; MacDorman &
Chattopadhyay, 2016) and naturalistic stimuli (Mathur &
Reichling, 2016; Poliakoff et al., 2013).
Overall, the present findings highlight the importance of
social factors in evaluating contemporary technological
artefacts, in particular those that involve human-like
characteristics.
