Abstract
During collaborative problem solving (CPS), coordination
occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. This multiscale
coordination should, at least on some scales, play a functional
role in facilitating effective collaboration outcomes. To
evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS
with 42 dyads. We used cross-wavelet coherence as a way to
examine the degree to which movement coordination is
evident at a variety of scales and tested whether the observed
coordination was greater than both the amount expected due
to chance and due to task demands. We found that
coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than expected
due to chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m)
was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we
evaluated whether the degree of coherence at scales less than
2s, and the form of coordination (in terms of relative phase),
were predictive of CPS performance. We found that .25s and
1s scales were predictive of performance. When including
relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase
movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest
predictor of CPS performance. We discuss these findings and
detail their relevance for expanding our knowledge on how
coordination facilitates CPS.

Introduction
Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is a cognitive skill
pervasive in many human interaction contexts ranging from
everyday life to highly complex work environments. CPS is
defined as “a process whereby two or more agents attempt
to solve a problem by sharing the understanding and effort
required to come to a solution and pooling their knowledge,
skills and efforts to reach that solution” (OECD, 2015, p. 6).
Given the increasing complexity of problems in
contemporary societal practices, and the need for multiple
disciplines to solve them, CPS has been recognized as an
essential 21st century skill. However, while some research
has examined CPS in a variety of laboratory (e.g., Berg,
Johnson, Meegan, & Strough, 2003; Roschelle & Teasley,
1995) and naturalistic contexts (e.g., Fiore, Wiltshire,
Oglesby, O’Keefe, & Salas, 2014; Jordan & McDaniel Jr,
2014), the state of the science is still limited. In this paper,
we explore the implications of the notion that CPS is a
multiscale phenomenon, and investigate the degree to which
movement coordination, at various scales, plays a functional
role in effective CPS.
Human interaction in any context is a dynamic, multiscale
phenomenon (e.g., Dale, Fusaroli, Duran, & Richardson,

2013; Steffensen & Pedersen, 2014). For example, during a
conversation, neural events transpire on the order of
milliseconds, speech production and gestures over seconds,
and the conversation itself on the order of minutes (Hasson,
Ghazanfar, Galantucci, Garrod, & Keysers, 2012). This
point, while oversimplified, illustrates the fact that human
interaction involves a variety of temporal and spatial scales
(e.g., neural, physiological, bodily). Recognizing human
interaction as multiscale, especially during CPS, implies
that coordination, both intra- and inter-personally, must
span a variety of these spatial and temporal scales in order
to effectively accomplish joint goals (Eiler, Kallen,
Harrison, & Richardson, 2013).
Indeed, a common question, particularly in the movement
sciences, has been to understand how systems with high
degrees of freedom, are able to functionally coordinate (e.g.,
Mitra, Amazeen, & Turvey, 1998). Coordination in this
context is simply the ways in which components and
processes of a system change together over time (Butner,
Berg, Baucom, & Wiebe, 2014). In an interpersonal context,
a wide variety of terms have been used to describe different
forms of coordination (Butler, 2011) such as
synchronization, co-regulation, entrainment, and coupling.
Evidence for many forms of interpersonal coordination are
quite pervasive amongst differing modalities (Fusaroli &
Tylén, 2016; Louwerse, Dale, Bard, & Jeuniaux, 2012) and
contexts (Palumbo et al., 2016). But, while many different
forms of coordination have been discovered, the ways in
which they facilitate effective interaction outcomes is less
studied (cf., Timmons, Margolin, & Saxbe, 2015),
particularly in collaborative contexts.
Prior research has suggested that coordination is required
for the accomplishment of joint goals (Mills, 2014) and that
stronger coordination should contribute to better
collaborative results (Barron, 2000). Findings so far have
been mixed, though, with regard to how coordination, albeit
in different modalities and scales, relates to optimal
performance on joint tasks (Gallotti, Fairhurst, & Frith,
2017). In one example, performance on a dyadic movement
task was predicted by a measure of coordination that
reflected interaction across multiple time scales (Davis,
Brooks, & Dixon, 2016). In another example, Abney,
Paxton, Dale, and Kello (2015) found that stronger
coordination in bodily movements were associated with
poorer performance on a movement-based dyadic problem
solving task. Louwerse et al. (2012) found that as task
difficulty increased, so too did coordination. Further,

1345

coordination of bodily movements in psychotherapy, a
highly collaborative endeavor (Tryon & Winograd, 2011),
were shown to link to effective treatment outcomes
(Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2011). While not related to
performance specifically, a number of interactional benefits
have been observed following periods of interpersonal
coordination such as increased affiliation (Hove & Risen,
2009) and cooperative behavior (Valdesolo, Ouyang, &
DeSteno, 2010; Wiltermuth & Heath, 2009).
Given the extant research, briefly reviewed here, we
expect that multiscale coordination of bodily movements
should have a functional relationship with performance in
complex, CPS. Relatedly, a recent theoretical account of
dialog proposed that high coordination in lower level
behaviors (e.g., posture) may provide a necessary
foundation for more variability and complementarity at
higher levels of dialog (Fusaroli, Rączaszek-Leonardi, &
Tylén, 2014). So, a key aspect that distinguishes the present
work from prior research is that we focus on movement
coordination in a challenging computer-based CPS context.

The Current Study
The present work is part of a larger study examining team
interaction dynamics during a dyadic CPS task (Wiltshire,
2015; Wiltshire, Butner, & Fiore, 2017). Whereas in prior
work, we have examined how transitions in communication
structures and their complexity relate to CPS performance
(Wiltshire et al., 2017), here we focus on coordination of
bodily movements at various time scales and how that
coordination relates to CPS performance.
We utilize cross-wavelet coherence as a way of
examining coordination of human interaction that is largely
unstructured, at least when compared to rhythmic movement
tasks (Fujiwara & Daibo, 2016; Issartel, Bardainne, Gaillot,
& Marin, 2015). This method allows for evaluation of the
degree of coordination of two continuous time series and
whether that coordination is in-phase or anti-phase. One of
its key strengths is that it retains a high level of precision in
both the time and frequency domains (Issartel et al., 2015).
This method has been used previously to examine
movement coordination in a variety of interactive contexts
such as the exchange of jokes (Schmidt, Morr, Fitzpatrick,
& Richardson, 2012), dialog (Fujiwara & Daibo, 2016), the
coordination of jazz musicians (Walton, Richardson,
Langland-Hassan, & Chemero, 2015), and dancers
(Washburn et al., 2014).
We expect that the coordination of bodily movements will
serve a functional role in facilitating effective CPS
performance. However, we also expect that this functional
role will vary based on time scales. In other words,
movement coordination at some time scales should be more
relevant to CPS than others. We thus adopt an exploratory
approach to determine what scales are important in
predicting effective CPS performance. Given the nature of
the task, it is likely that smaller time scale movements will
matter such as those that occur while controlling the
computer-based task as well as during speech. When

examining interpersonal coordination dynamics, it is
essential to demonstrate that the observed coordination is
greater than can be expected due to chance alone (Ramseyer
& Tschacher, 2010), and that it is not solely due to task
constraints (Strang, Funke, Russell, Dukes, & Middendorf,
2014). Thus, we advance the following research hypotheses
(H) and research questions (RQ):
• H1: Movement coordination will be greater than
chance, at least at lower scales.
• H2: Movement coordination will be greater than can be
expected due to task constraints.
• RQ1: At what scales does movement coordination
predict CPS performance?
• RQ2: Does the form of coordination (e.g., in-phase,
anti-phase) at these scales relate to performance?

Method
Participants
84 undergraduate students (31 female, Mage =19.2 years,
range 18-28 years; ~ 67% White, 8% Black, 10% Hispanic,
10% Asian, and 5% other) from a large United States
university voluntarily participated in this experiment
comprising 42 dyadic teams. There were five female-only
teams, 17 male-only teams, and 20 mixed-gender teams.
Participants must have had general video game experience
using a mouse and keyboard for third-person video games,
no prior history of seizures, no experience using the
Moonbase Alpha simulation, and no prior acquaintance.

Materials
Participants sat face-to-face with each other with two
desktop computers offset to one side. This setup allowed
them to view the other’s face and torso. The computer
screens were placed back-to-back. A Logitech HD webcam
model C615 was used to record the participants from a
profile view. All videos were collected in 720p resolution.

Task
NASA’s Moonbase Alpha is a complex, CPS task (NASA,
2011) that places team members in a simulated scenario
where a meteor strike damages critical life support systems
of a moonbase. The goal of the Moonbase Alpha task is for
participants to fully restore oxygen to the settlement in 25
minutes or less. Both team members must work together to
solve the problem by figuring out how to fix and/or replace
damaged components of the life support system such as
solar panels, power cables, couplers, and a power
distributor. A variety of tools and coordination strategies
must be employed to complete the task; however, there are
no predefined guidelines for how to completely repair the
settlement in the given timeframe.

Procedure
Participants were briefed about the nature of the experiment
and asked to introduce themselves to each other by

1346

providing a greeting and sharing their name with the other
participant. Participants were then given an informed
consent document to review and asked to complete a
biographical questionnaire.
Participants were then provided a PowerPoint tutorial that
covered the basics of the Moonbase Alpha simulation,
which were derived from the simulation’s instruction
manual (NASA, 2011). Further, participants were told that
they would be tested on the content. After completing the
PowerPoint, they received a 10-item multiple-choice
knowledge assessment (see Wiltshire, 2015).
After completion of the knowledge assessment, the
necessity for communication to complete the task was
reiterated. Participants were then instructed to begin the
simulation. A short video introduced the problem (i.e., the
moonbase was damaged by a meteorite and life support
functions need to be restored) before participants began the
25-minute task. The task was considered complete either
when time ran out or once participants fully restored
oxygen, whichever came first.

Cross-Wavelet Coherence We examined dyadic movement
coordination with the cross-wavelet transformation method
by using the wtc function from the biwavelet package
(Gouhier, Grinsted, & Simko, 2016) in R. This is a spectral
decomposition method that allows for examination of time
localized oscillations in a variety of frequencies and how the
spectrum changes in those frequencies over time (Issartel,
Marin, Gaillot, Bardainne, & Cadopi, 2006). This method is
known to be robust to nonstationary time series (Issartel et
al., 2015). We extracted the average coherence and average
relative phase values from the following frequency ranges:
.25s, .5s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, ~1m, ~2m, and ~4.5m
within +/- .5 scales (frequency scales are converted to time
domain by multiplying them by the 8 Hz sampling rate and
dividing by 60 for minutes). Coherence is the spectral
equivalent to a cross-correlation. Values of 0 convey no
coordination and a value of 1 conveys absolute coordination
(Schmidt, Nie, Franco, & Richardson, 2014). Relative phase
indicates whether the oscillations are in-phase (0°), antiphase (180°), or exhibiting a lag (between 0° and 180°).

CPS Performance

Surrogate and Virtual Pairs Analyses Surrogate analysis
was conducted by computing a shuffled transformation of
each observed movement time series and repeated the crosswavelet analyses for each dyad. This effectively destroys the
temporal pattern in the data while preserving the
distributional properties (Louwerse et al., 2012). Any
measures of coordination applied to these are widely
interpreted as the degree of coordination expected due to
chance (Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2010).
For the virtual pairs analysis, 42 randomized
combinations of individuals who did not interact together
were created. Because these individuals did not interact with
each other, but were performing the same task, coordination
measures calculated from virtual pairs have been interpreted
as the coordination that can be expected due to the task
demands (Strang et al., 2014). Thus, cross-wavelet analyses
were conducted on these virtual pairs. Where time series
were of unequal length, the longer time series was truncated
to the length of the shorter series. Separate paired-sample ttests were used to compare between observed coherence and
surrogate coherence as well as between observed coherence
and virtual pairs coherence for each time scale.

Problem solving performance was determined by a rescaled
combination of three variables: (a) the total time taken to
restore life support (0-25 minutes), (b) the total percentage
of oxygen restored (0-100%), and (c) a ratio of completed
object repairs to the total possible repairs (0-25; only for
teams that restored zero oxygen). The rescale function in
R (R Core R Core Team, 2016) was used to place teams
whose performance restored no oxygen at all into a range of
0-33 as a function of their ratio of object repairs/total
possible object repairs. Those teams that restored some, but
not all, oxygen were rescaled to fit a range of 34-66. Lastly,
for those teams that restored all oxygen, the time to
complete the task was inversely rescaled to fit the range of
67-100 (with lower times leading to higher scores).

Analytic Strategy
Frame-Differencing We used Paxton and Dale’s (2013)
video frame-differencing technique to extract a time series
representing the level of bodily movement for each
participant from all videos at an 8 Hz sampling rate. For the
current task, this measure of bodily movement captures
behaviors such as speech, postural sway, gestures,
adjustment of position, hand movements controlling the
mouse and keyboard, and shifting of the legs and/or feet. In
general, this technique provides an objective measure of the
amount of movement a given participant is exhibiting
moment-by-moment over the duration of the task with
higher values corresponding to more movement. The tradeoff when using this type of method is that there is a loss of
specificity with regard to the types of movements that are
coordinated, but movement can be extracted with relatively
little effort and time compared to more specific movement
coding systems (cf. Louwerse et al., 2012; Paxton & Dale,
2013).

Examining Relationship Between Coordination and
Performance Our approach to answering RQs 1 and 2 was
exploratory based on the results from H1. Specifically, we
first conducted a linear multiple regression model with the
observed coherence values at scales that were significantly
greater than chance as predictors of performance. Then, we
took those values that were significant predictors of
performance and included them in a second multiple
regression model with the relative phase values for those
respective scales.

Results
In order to examine H1, that the observed coordination
would be greater than chance at some scales, the coherence

1347

values for the surrogate data were compared to the
coherence of the observed data. Results (see Table 1)
suggested that coherence was significantly greater than
chance at the .25s, .5s, 1s, and 2s frequency scales.

the observed data. Results (see Table 1) suggested that
coherence was significantly greater than could be expected
due to task demands and environment alone for all
frequency scales except 16s, 1m, and 2m.
To better understand the relationship between coherence
and performance, we present two examples of cross-wavelet
coherence plots in Figure 1. The top example is derived
from the top performing team and the bottom example is
derived from the lowest performing team. The y-axis
corresponds to the frequency scale (which when divided by
8 can be related to time in seconds). The x-axis corresponds
to the time on task with each point corresponding to 1/8 of a
second (or one video frame). The colors correspond to the
amount of coherence with warmer colors indicating high
coherence. Arrows indicate phase relationships with right
arrows conveying in-phase and left arrows conveying antiphase. Arrows shifted up or down convey a lag in the
oscillations between participants.
Next, we turn to RQs 1 and 2. In our first model, we
included the four scales that were significantly more
coordinated than expected due to chance alone as predictors
of CPS performance (.25s, .5s, 1s, and 2s). Overall, this
model accounted for a significant 30.2% (R2adj = .226;
F(4,37) = 4.00, p = .009) of the variability in CPS
performance with coherence at the .25s (β = -.584, p = .017)
and 1s scales (β = .789, p = .003) as significant predictors of
performance. The .5s and 2s scales were not significant (ps
> .05). Regarding RQ1, these results suggest that whereas
stronger movement coordination at the 1s scale is a strong
predictor of better CPS performance, stronger coordination
at the .25s scale is associated with poorer performance.
Next, we sought to better understand the form of
coordination at these scales. Thus, we conducted a second
model that included coherence as well as relative phase at
.25s and 1s scales. This model accounted for a significant
34.6% (R2adj = .276; F(4,37) = 4.90, p=.003) of the
variability in CPS performance with coherence (β = .614, p
= .007) and relative phase (M = 3°, SD = 2°; β = -.294, p =
.038) at the 1s scale as significant predictors of
performance. Now, however, coherence at .25s was not
significant (β = -.412, p = .06) nor was relative phase at .25s
(p = .24). Thus, these results suggest that movement
coordination at the 1s scale is a primary predictor of
performance and further, that relative phase values at the 1s
scale closer to 0° (more in-phase) are associated with better
CPS performance.

Discussion
Figure 1: Cross-wavelet coherence plots for a high
performing team (top) and low performing team (bottom).
Likewise, in order to examine H2, that the observed
interpersonal movement coordination would be greater than
due to task demands and environment, the coherence values
for the virtual pairs data were compared to the coherence of

In this work, we investigated the multiscale, movement
coordination dynamics that emerge in computer-based CPS.
We found that movements in .25s-2s scales were
significantly more coordinated than chance and that all but
the 16s, 1m, and 2m scales were more coordinated than
expected due to task demands. We also observed that where
coordination was greater than chance, both .25s and 1s were
associated with CPS performance. However, when also
accounting for relative phase, it appeared that higher in-

1348

phase coordination at the 1s scale was the best predictor of
CPS performance. Thus, some significant variability in CPS
performance, in this context, appears to be explained by
specific, low-scale patterns of coherence.
Given the low specificity of the movement data extracted
from video, the question remains as to what is coordinated
at these low scales and why they matter. In general,
interactional phenomena that play out on (and below) a .25s
timescale differ qualitatively from phenomena at a .5s
timescale and beyond. For example, how interlocutors
orient to each other’s behavior as meaningful for the
interaction depends on timing. Short pauses in interaction
(typically < .25s) are treated as idiosyncratic variation in
speech; pauses around .5s mark a transition space where the
next speaker can take the word; and longer pauses (> 1s)
“are often treated as flagging something unusual or
troublesome about the interaction” (Mushin & Gardner,
2009, p. 2035). Although, in addition to capturing these
aspects of dialog, the observed coordination also captures
mouse and keyboard movements, which likely unfold at
these low scales as well. In general, many of the modalities
captured by our movement measure can be argued to be task
relevant as they capture dialogical events and computer
input required for collaboration, but future work could
consider more specific modalities such as how mouse
movements are coordinated.
As far as future work is concerned, it is important to note
some observable differences in coherence between the high
and low performing teams in Fig. 1. There appear to be
differences at higher scales, although average coherence
was not generally above chance at these scales. However,
we can speculate that participants’ performance may reflect
their ability to create functional coherence across scales
(e.g., between bodily ability and task demands), which
could be assessed with fractal analyses (Davis et al., 2016).
Further, it may be that successful CPS performance relies on
higher-order transitions (Wiltshire et al., 2017) in
coordination at one or more slow scales, as could be
tenuously suggested by the pattern of high-low-high
coherence near the 2m scale across the duration of the task.
Thus, future work should also consider extracting not only
specific scales, but also time ranges that could be
theoretically important to CPS.
More generally, research of this nature is important
because it advances an efficient means of unobtrusively
examining coordination processes during collaboration with
a goal of working toward systems that can elicit forms of
coordination that enable effective collaboration (Fiore &
Wiltshire, 2016; Kim, Chang, Holland, & Pentland, 2008;
Wiltshire & Fiore, 2014). However, more work is necessary
to understand if movement coordination is related to CPS
performance in larger teams (de Montjoye, Stopczynski,
Shmueli, Pentland, & Lehmann, 2014), with different roles
and disciplinary expertise (Bergmann, Dale, Sattari, Heit, &
Bhat, 2016), and when the teams are not co-located. Of
course, such pursuits may require considering alternative
modalities in which multiscale coordination might also

occur. We expect that such endeavors are essential to
advancing our knowledge of the way that coordination
during human interaction relates to collaborative cognition.
