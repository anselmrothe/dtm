Abstract: Can infants map diverse positive emotional expressions to their probable causes? Across two studies (including
one pre-registered experiment), we used a preferential-looking task to find that infants as young as 12-17 months (mean:
14.8 months) successfully matched non-verbal vocalizations elicited by funny, exciting, adorable, sympathetic, and delicious
images to their probable causes (Experiments 1 and 2). Do infants also posit unobserved causes of emotional expressions? In
both exploratory and pre-registered experiments, an adult peeked into a box and made one of two distinct positive emotional
vocalizations (Experiment 3: “Aww!” or “Mmm!”; Experiment 4: “Aww!” or “Whoa!”). Infants reaching into the box retrieved
either a probable or improbable cause of the reaction. Infants were more likely to search again on incongruent trials. These
results suggest that infants make nuanced distinctions among emotions, and infer probable causes of emotional reactions.
