Abstract
Two experiments tested how the number of illustrations in
storybooks influences 3.5-year-old children’s word learning
from shared reading. In Experiment 1, children encountered
stories with either two illustrations, one illustration or one
large illustration (in the control group) per spread. Children
learned significantly fewer words when they had to find the
referent within two illustrations presented at the same time. In
Experiment 2 a gesture was added to guide children’s
attention to the correct page in the two illustrations condition.
Children who saw two illustrations with a guiding gesture
learned words as well as children who had seen only one
illustration per spread. Results are discussed in terms of the
cognitive load of word learning from storybooks.
Keywords: word learning; cognitive load; extraneous
information; storybooks; illustrations.

Sharing illustrated storybooks is a common activity for
parents and young children (e.g., Rideout, Vanderwater, &
Wartella, 2003) and provides a richer source of vocabulary
than everyday conversation (Montag, Jones, & Smith,
2015). Several studies demonstrate that the styles of
illustrations influence how well children learn from books
(e.g., Tare, Chion, Ganea, & DeLoache, 2010). However,
little is known about how the number of illustrations
influences learning. The current experiments investigate
how well children learn new words from storybooks when
they view one or two illustrated scenes at a time.
Pre-literate children rely on illustrations to help them
make sense of the story content (for a review see, Wagner,
2013). Specifically, in an eye-tracking study, Justice,
Skibbe, Canning, and Lankford (2005) found 4-year-old
kindergarten children looked longer at the illustrations than
the print that accompanied texts, indicating that even with
some emerging print awareness, children look primarily at
illustrations. In another eye-tracking study, Evans and SaintAubin (2005) found that even with a range of illustration
styles, preschool children spent the majority of their time
looking at illustrations and only 6% of their time looking at
the printed text (see e.g., Roy-Charland, Perron, Boulard,
Chamberland, & Hoffman, 2015; Roy-Charland, SaintAubin, & Evans, 2007).
Pre-literate children have a growing awareness of reading
conventions, such as, print conveys meaning and is read
from left-to-right and top-to-bottom (for a review see
International Reading Association & The National

Association for the Education of Young Children, 1998;
Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998). However, because they
cannot yet read, young children are unlikely to know when
the reader has moved from the left-hand page to the righthand page. That is, children may be unable to determine
which illustrated scene represents which part of the story.
Thus, multiple illustrated scenes displayed simultaneously
may make it more challenging to associate new words with
their illustrated representations.
Evidence suggests that word learning is even more
challenging for children when increasing amounts of
perceptual information are presented simultaneously. For
example, children struggle to learn object names when
target objects are presented in less predictable locations
(Benitez & Smith, 2012), with many extraneous objects
(Horst, Scott, & Pollard, 2010) and with multiple
combinations of extraneous objects, rather than the same
combinations repeatedly (Axelsson & Horst, 2014). Such
findings are consistent with cognitive load theory (Sweller,
1998, 1989 or see, Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003 for a
review), which explains how working memory capacity is
inherently limited and is especially problematic in situations
with extraneous information. Thus, reducing extraneous
perceptual information helps children focus on the target
information, which then improves learning. For example,
Son, Smith, and Goldstone (2008), reduced cognitive load
by providing simplified depictions of novel objects and
found that this promoted better generalization of novel
objects than more complex examples. Whether decreasing
the number of illustrated scenes presented simultaneously in
a storybook also decreases the cognitive load of word
learning from shared storybook reading remains unknown.
In the current experiments we investigate whether
decreasing the number of storybook illustrations presented
simultaneously increases preschool children’s ability to
learn words incidentally from shared storybook reading. All
children were presented with three storybooks that included
illustrated scenes of a family’s activities. The same two
novel objects were included across the scenes and were
named on the pages on which they were depicted (four
pages for each object). Critically, all children heard the
same three stories and saw the same 10 illustrations per
story, however, the number of illustrations presented
simultaneously and guidance varied across conditions. In
Experiment 1, children saw either two illustrations (one

2007

scene on each page of the open book) or one illustration
(only on the right-hand page with the other side blank).
Children in a control condition saw a large storybook (cf.
Big Book Reading, Tse & Nicholson, 2014) with one
illustrated scene the same size as the two illustrations
combined because we were concerned that another
difference between the other conditions was the length of
time needed to visually scan the two illustrations rather than
one illustration. If decreasing the number of illustrations
also decreases the cognitive load of word learning from
storybooks then children should learn more words when
they see only one illustration at a time. In contrast, if the
number of illustrations does not affect cognitive load, then
children should learn words equally from one- or twoillustration books. In Experiment 2, we investigate whether
guiding children’s attention to the correct page with a
simple gesture helps children focus on the correct page and
improves word learning—even with two illustrations.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants Thirty-six 3.5-year-old children (M = 41.99
months, SD = 1.76 months, range = 38.87-45.14 months)
participated. Children were monolingual, British-English
speakers from predominantly middle-class families. All
children were typically developing with no reported speech
or language difficulties. Twelve children each were
randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: one
illustration (M = 41.87, SD = 0.65, 6 girls), two illustrations
(M = 42.85, SD = 0.43, 6 girls), or control condition (one
large illustration, M = 41.92, SD = 0.45, 6 girls). There was
no difference in maternal education levels between
conditions, Fisher’s Exact Test = 3.71, p = .98. Two
mothers each in the one and two illustrations conditions and
three mothers in the control condition had completed high
school (GCSEs and/or A-levels) and/or completed a
vocational diploma or access course. Eight mothers each in
the one and two illustrations conditions, and six in the
control condition had an undergraduate degree and/or an
undergraduate degree with a postgraduate certificate (e.g.,
Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), an additional
teaching qualification). One mother each in the one
illustration and control conditions had a Master’s degree and
one mother in each condition had a doctoral degree. One
mother in the two illustrations condition and one mother in
the control condition declined to answer this question.
Parents were reimbursed for travel costs and children chose
a small gift as a thank you for participating (e.g., a colouring
book).
Storybooks. Stimuli included three 10-page storybooks
slightly modified from Horst, Parsons, and Bryan (2011)
The Very Naughty Puppy, Nosy Rosie at the Restaurant, and
Rosie’s Bad Baking Day. Each storybook depicted and
named the same two novel objects four times. Each object
had a function: the orange inverted slingshot functioned like

a hand mixer (tannin) and the metal kinetic wheel was used
like a rolling pin (sprock). Throughout each story, objects
were named incidentally and were not the focus of the story.
The objects appeared twice on their own pages and twice
together. We used real photographs edited with the poster
edges feature in Photoshop to make them look like drawings
typical of a commercially available children’s book. Across
storybooks there was no difference in the number of words
per page, M = 45, SD = 9.34, F(2,24) = 0.98, p = .39.
All children heard the same stories and saw all the
illustrations for each story. The only difference between
conditions was the way storybooks were printed (see Figure
1): children either heard stories with two A4 illustrated
scenes per open spread, one A4 illustrated scene per spread
(i.e., the left-hand page was always blank), or one A3
illustrated scene per spread. In the ISO A-series paper
system (i.e., European standard), A3 pages (29.70 x 42.00
cm) are twice the size of A4 pages (21.00 x 29.70 cm), thus
the A3 condition served as a control condition where the
storybooks included only one illustration per spread (as in
the one A4 illustration condition) but included the same
overall illustrated area as the two A4 illustrations condition).
Because the one illustrations condition differed from the
two illustrations condition in both surface area and amount
of items/details, we wanted to include a control condition to
disentangle which of these was driving any potential effects.
Equating the number of items/details would have precluded
presenting all children with the same illustrations; therefore,
we tested surface area as the control condition. Data from all
three conditions were collected at the same time.

Figure 1. Page 5 in Rosie’s Bad Baking Day as seen by
children in the 2 illustrations, 1 illustration and 1 large
illustration conditions, respectively. Note, in the 2
illustrations condition page 4 is viewed at the same time as
page 5.
Test stimuli. An A4 test booklet with images of four novel
objects per right-hand page was used on the test trials (the
left-hand pages were blank). On each page, four objects
were presented on a plain white background without any
other contextual information. Across test trials the targets
(tannin and sprock) were presented with four additional
novel objects that the children had not previously seen, so
that each trial would present children with a different
combination and it would not appear that a question was
being repeated. Finally, a practice trial page included
images of four known objects: a dog, a plane, a duck and a
chair.

2008

Procedure. Each child was tested individually in a
children’s lab at the university. During the reading phase,
the experimenter sat opposite the child and held the
storybook upright, to her side, with the pages facing the
child, like a preschool teacher would when reading to a
group of children during “circle time.” The parent sat on a
seat in a different corner of the room. All children were read
each of the three stories. For each child all three stories were
presented in the same format (e.g., two illustrations per
spread). No dialogic techniques, such as giving definitions
for novel words or pointing, were used during the readings.
Story-order was counterbalanced across children.
After reading the final story, the experimenter proceeded
to the test phase, which began with four warm-up trials to
get the child used to pointing to pictures in the test booklet
and to ensure the child understood the task. The
experimenter opened the test booklet to one of the warm-up
trial pages and asked the child to point to one of the familiar
objects (e.g., “can you point to the plane?”). Across the four
counterbalanced warm-up trials, children were asked to
point to an object in each quadrant of the page. Next, the
experimenter tested word learning. On each trial the
experimenter turned to a different test page and asked the
child to point to one of the novel objects. In total children
were asked to point to each target novel object twice (see
also Werchan & Gómez, 2014). On half of the trials one
target was present (e.g., sprock with three other novel
objects) and on half of the trials both targets were present
(e.g., sprock and tannin with two other novel objects).
These latter trials ensured that children were not simply
choosing the correct object because it had been the only one
they had previously seen (for a review of this issue see
(Axelsson & Horst, 2013). Trial order, page and quadrant
were counterbalanced across participants.
To confirm that children do not dislike books with only
one illustration per page, we also asked children to rate their
enjoyment of the individual stories and found no differences
in enjoyment across stories or conditions, therefore for
brevity these data are not included here but are available
from the authors upon request.

Results
Children in the one illustrations condition (M = 0.75, SD =
0.34, t(11) = 5.14, p < .001, d = 1.48) and in the control (one
large) condition (M = 0.75, SD = 0.30, t(11) = 5.75, p <
.001, d = 1.66), chose the target object more than expected
by chance (.25) see Figure 2, Left Panel. However, with
Bonferroni’s correction (p = .017), children in the two
illustrations condition did not chose the target object more
than expected by chance (M = 0.44, SD = 0.28, t(11) = 2.28,
p = .04, d = .66). To test for differences between illustration
formats, children's proportions of correct choices were
entered into an ANOVA with illustration format (two, one,
one large) as between-subjects factor. The ANOVA yielded
a main effect of illustration format, F(2, 33) = 4.10, p = .03,
partial η = 0.20. Planned contrasts showed that children
who saw two illustrations learned fewer words than children
2

who saw one illustration per spread, t(33) = 2.87, p = .007,
partial η = 0.20. There was no difference in word learning
between one illustration in A4 or one illustration in A3 t(33)
= 0.00, ns. Thus, illustration size did not affect word
learning, but the number of illustrations did.

Discussion
Many illustrated storybooks are printed with two
illustrations per spread (e.g., In the Night Kitchen by
Maurice Sendak or Dinosaur Roar! By Paul and Henrietta
Stickland)—if not more (e.g., The Incredible Book Eating
Boy by Oliver Jeffers contains 6 illustrations on pages 7-8).
Further, some books include a combination of one or more
illustrations per spread (e.g., The Smartest Giant in Town by
Julia Donaldson). Our goal is not to suggest that all of these
books be reprinted. Therefore, we conducted a
supplementary experiment to provide children with
additional support so that they can learn from storybooks
with multiple illustrations.
Because young children do not necessarily know when the
text is referring to the left- or right-hand page, they may
benefit from a non-verbal gesture to look to the correct
page. Specifically, a non-verbal signal may help children to
focus on the correct illustration at the correct time, thus
improving their chances of learning new words from the
storybook (cf. Booth, McGregor, & Rohlfing, 2008).
Thus, in Experiment 2 we again read children storybooks
with two illustrations per spread, but included a quick
sweeping hand gesture to indicate which page we were
reading from. We chose a sweeping gesture over other
possible techniques to keep the manipulation visual without
additional auditory information. We did not use a pointing
gesture because we wanted to perform the same gesture on
every page and some pages did not include a novel object,
while others included both novel objects. Thus, this

2009

sweeping gesture allowed us to maintain an incidental word
learning task, rather than providing ostensive reference. If
storybooks with one illustrated scene per spread are more
helpful than storybooks with two illustrated scenes because
children do not know which page to look at, then guiding
them towards the correct page should improve word
learning to similar levels as those from single illustration
displays.

Experiment 2
Method
Participants An additional twelve 3.5-year-old children (M
= 40.45 months, SD = 1.30 months, range = 38.45 to 45.03
months, 6 girls) participated. Children were monolingual,
British-English speakers with no reported speech or
language difficulties. Two mothers had completed high
school (GCSE’s and/or A-levels), seven had an
undergraduate degree or an undergraduate degree with a
postgraduate certificate. One mother had completed a
Master’s degree, one a doctoral degree and one declined to
provide this information. Parents were reimbursed for travel
costs and children chose a small gift as a thank you for
participating (e.g., a colouring book).
Stimuli. The same stimuli were used as in the two
illustrations condition in Experiment 1.
Procedure
All children were read the three storybooks with two
illustrations per spread. The procedure was the same as in
Experiment 1 except that before reading each page, the
experimenter smoothly swept her open hand from the top of
the page to the bottom, thereby drawing children’s attention
to the correct page.

Results
Children learned the words from the story (see Figure 2,
Right Panel). Specifically, children chose the target object
more than expected by chance (M = 0.88, SD = 0.17, t(11) =
12.84, p < .001, d = 3.71). Our goal was to determine
whether adding a simple gesture would be sufficient to
improve children’s word learning from storybooks with two
illustrations per spread. Thus, we compared the word
learning performance of children in the current study to
children in the two illustrations condition of Experiment 1.
Children who had the additional support to guide their
attention to the correct page learned words significantly
better than children who did not have that support, t(22) =
4.58, p < .001, d = 8.78.

Discussion
In Experiment 2 we investigated whether orienting
children’s attention to the correct storybook page with a
simple gesture while reading could diminish the effects of
cognitive load from multiple illustrated scenes found in
Experiment 1. Adding the gesture did not significantly

increase the amount of time needed to read the story, but did
significantly improve children’s word learning compared to
reading without a guiding gesture.
The rates of word learning observed in Experiment 2 are
similar to other studies using dialogic reading techniques,
such as pointing or asking questions (Walsh & Blewitt,
2006). For example, Ard and Beverly (2004) read
storybooks to 3- and 4-year-old children either verbatim or
with one of three dialogic techniques; added questions,
added comments, or both questions and comments. Children
learned approximately 75% of the new vocabulary with the
dialogic reading techniques included but only 53% with
verbatim readings. Although the efficacy of the use of
dialogic techniques to improve children’s word learning
from storybooks is not in doubt, multiple dialogic
techniques are often employed in combination, making it
harder to compare effects across the literature for individual
techniques (see Wasik, Hindman, & Snell, 2016 for a recent
review). It is therefore particularly exciting to see that such
a simple gesture could have such powerful effects on
children’s learning.

General Discussion
Across two experiments we investigated whether decreasing
the number of storybook illustrations presented
simultaneously increases preschool children’s ability to
learn words from shared storybook reading. In Experiment
1 we read children 10-page stories with either one, two, or
one large illustration per spread. Children learned the new
words better when presented with only one illustration per
spread, regardless of the image size, even though all
children saw the same number of illustrations overall. In
Experiment 2 we read children the same stories with two
illustrations per spread, but added a small sweeping gesture
to indicate which page we were reading. Although children
in this condition were presented with multiple illustrations
at once, they were able to learn more words than expected
by chance and more words than children presented with the
same number of illustrations but no guidance on which page
to attend to. Taken together these findings suggest that
children’s word learning is improved by helping children
focus on the relevant information by either reducing the
number of illustrations presented (Experiment 1) or
directing their attention to the correct illustration
(Experiment 2).
These findings are consistent with cognitive load theory
(Paas et al., 2003; Sweller, 1988, 1989), which suggests that
extraneous information can prevent optimal learning. The
more information children need to think about, the more
challenging the task. Consequently, removing extraneous
perceptual information may improve learning (see, e.g., Son
et al., 2008). For example, kindergarten children are better
able to learn information from science lessons when the
extraneous information of a highly-decorated classroom is
removed (Fisher, Godwin, & Seltman, 2014). Similarly,
reducing the amount of extraneous information in graphs
improves children’s mathematics skills (Kaminski &

2010

Sloutsky, 2013) and removing extraneous information in
ABC books improves alphabet learning (Chiong &
DeLoache, 2012). In the current study, in the two
illustrations format, children are faced with processing
additional materials—which in some cases may even
provide conflicting information—slowing down the process
of word learning. Children do not know when the story
moves from one illustration to the other. In contrast, in the
one illustration format, the child is provided with only the
relevant scene, which corresponds with the text they are
currently hearing, thereby reducing the cognitive load
associated with understanding the story and the new words.
Similarly in Experiment 2, children are directed towards the
relevant scene, thereby reducing cognitive load.
Although children in the current studies learned target
words better when presented with single illustrations, there
may be benefits for other types of learning from multiple
illustrations. For example, story comprehension may be
better supported by having more to look at, particularly as
visual attention to illustrations during storybook reading
predicts story comprehension (Kaefer, Pinkham, & Neuman,
2016).
The current findings may also be informative for research
comparing e-books (i.e., storybooks presented on screens)
with traditional two-illustration paper storybooks. Some
studies report a deficit in learning from e-books (e.g.,
Segers, Takke, & Verhoeven, 2004) while others do not
(e.g., Korat & Shamir, 2007). One explanation for this
discrepancy is that e-books often contain added
manipulative features, which may hinder learning. For
example, e-books often contain additional games (e.g., de
Jong & Bus, 2002) or interactive dictionary features (e.g.,
Korat, 2009). Previous research indicates that added
manipulative features such as pull-tabs hinder learning from
paper books (Tare et al., 2010), however some features of ebooks may be helpful in the same way as dialogic
techniques by highlighting key information at the right time.
Another explanation is that e-books are often presented only
one illustration at a time (e.g., Verhallen & Bus, 2011),
which could be an additional confounding factor when
comparing between storybook media types. The current
findings suggest that such single illustrations help children
focus their attention on relevant information and may aid
learning especially when children are exploring books
without an adult.
The current experiments demonstrate that reducing the
number of simultaneous illustrations to just one at a time
improves children’s word learning from shared storybook
reading. This has important implications for educational
research and suggests that even seemingly minor differences
in illustration format can result in significant differences in
how well children learn. These findings should help shape
future storybook research design, and provide useful
practical solutions, which could be used by teachers and
parents alike and may inform our understanding of how to
create eBooks and other media that children may encounter
without an adult. Furthermore, in an age of seemingly

endless possibilities, they provide a stark reminder that less
is sometimes more.
