Abstract

environmental influences, it is also possible that an infant’s
comprehension of colour terms has been underestimated.
It is clear that infants have difficulty grasping an adult-like
understanding of the meaning of a colour word, but this does
not necessarily imply that they have failed to grasp the meaning of the term. Research into the slow inductive process of
colour word learning has shown that it is possible for toddlers
from around 30 months to 40 months to comprehend basic
colour terms while still making errors (Wagner, Dobkins, &
Barner, 2013; Wagner, Jergens, & Barner, 2014). This suggests that colour words are similar to most other classes of
word, in that children first acquire a partial meaning for the
colour terms, and start producing the terms, before then later
slowly acquiring a fuller, adult-like meaning. In this case,
proper, adult-like comprehension follows only after production, further raising questions about what it is to comprehend
in such an abstract category of words. While this account may
provide some insight into how colour words are learned, the
participants are old enough that they may have already comprehended colour words to a degree. This raises two questions: when are colour words learned, and what is meant in
this instance by “learned?”
The present study employs two different means to answer these questions: a parental word-learning survey, and
an eye tracking paradigm. While word-learning surveys are
particularly useful for measuring production (Fenson et al.,
1994), measuring comprehension in this way has been debated (Tomasello & Mervis, 1994; Houston-Price, Mather, &
Sakkalou, 2007), despite test showing that if anything, they
could even be an underestimate of the child’s ability (Styles
& Plunkett, 2009). In the case of colour terms, which are a
much more abstract category of word than concrete nouns,
this doubt might be magnified. The aim of the present study
is to investigate when colour word learning is occurring, and
in doing so, establish where the process of colour term acquisition might begin. The results of the parental survey are
then to be compared to eye-tracking data, in order to confirm
the measures of early comprehension, and compare them to
measures of production from the survey.

Colour word learning has traditionally been viewed as a difficult task. Previous accounts have focussed on infants’ ability to
show an adult-like understanding of colour terms. Here we examine whether infants understand colour terms at a basic level,
using two different methods: first, evidence from parental reports that British infants can comprehend colour terms early,
second from experimental data using eye-tracking. These finding show that colour word learning is a process that begins
much earlier than previously thought, and develops slowly as
infants learn where the boundaries of each term are located.
Due to their abstract properties, colour words present a unique
opportunity to assess category learning in infants, as well as
the mechanisms that control word learning in general.

Introduction
It has long been documented that colour words are difficult
for children to learn (Kowalski & Zimiles, 2006; O’Hanlon
& Roberson, 2006; Soja, 1994; Sandhofer & Smith, 1999).
They are learned late (Heider, 1971; Franklin, 2006) and even
when infants do learn to say colour words, they are riddled
with errors (Pitchford & Mullen, 2003). But just how difficult are colour words to learn? Studies to date have had
difficulty establishing a time-line for when colour words are
learned, leading to various theories about why colour words
are more difficult to learn, such as the inability to put categorical terms on a continuous spectrum of colour (Andrick
& Tager-Flusberg, 1986), or their ability to abstract colour as
a relevant domain of linguistic meaning (Kowalski & Zimiles, 2006; O’Hanlon & Roberson, 2006; Sandhofer & Smith,
1999). In the present study, it is demonstrated that in fact infants have some degree of colour word knowledge much earlier than previously shown, and that they are able to recognise
typical colours when named. This finding suggests that the
difficulties that infants have with understanding colour terms
correctly may be due more to an inability to recognise the category boundary, rather than a complete lack of understanding
of the basic terms.
Research into colour word learning in infants has shown
that the age of acquisition has dropped dramatically over time
(Franklin, 2006; Shatz, Behrend, Gelman, & Ebeling, 1996).
While early studies had colour words learned as late as 7;0
(Heider, 1971), more recent studies have concluded that they
are learned successfully around three years of age (Pitchford
& Mullen, 2002) or earlier (Mervis, Bertrand, & Pani, 1995).
While there may be an actual drop in age of colour term acquisition due to a rise in coloured plastic goods or other such

Procedure Parents were asked to fill out the Oxford Communicative Development Inventory (Oxford CDI, Hamilton,
Plunkett, & Schafer, 2000). The Oxford CDI is a British
adaptation of MacArthur-Bates CDIs (Fenson et al., 1994),
which contains 416 terms. The Oxford CDI differs from
the MacArthur-Bates CDIs in that it measures comprehension
and production for the full age range of participants. Parents
or caregivers were asked to check if their child does not comprehend, comprehends, or comprehends and produces each
word. Thus an infant was marked as producing a term only
if they were thought to “comprehend and produce” the term,
while selecting either “comprehends” or “comprehends and
produces” saw them marked as comprehending.
The Oxford CDI contains four colour terms: red, blue,
green, and yellow. Only data from these four terms are included in the analysis.
Data was analysed in two separate binomial regressions,
one for the comprehension data, and another for the production data, where the outcome was a binary response for the
colour term in question (yes or no for either comprehension
or production). Both models had fixed effects of which colour
term was being recorded, as well as age of participant and
the gender of the participant. Gender and colour were both
dummy coded in each model.

The results from Table 1 show that there was a large difference between green and the other colours, both in speaking
and comprehension, while yellow and red were both slightly
behind blue in both areas. Male infants learned the colour
words significantly slower than female infants, suggesting
that the general advantage that has been seen in word learning for female infants also applies to colour word learning,
although it is possible that there is an effect of the higher rates
of colour vision problems in males.
The results show that the four basic colour terms measured
in this report are learned at a similar age, as reported by parents. All four colour terms are learned mostly within a month
of each other, however the data suggests that green may be
learned significantly after the other three, with blue generally the first colour term learned. Green may in many cases
be learned after the other three colours, but only by a short
amount of time. Around three months on average separates
learning the colour word and producing it – a gap that suggests that there is a very short time in between basic learning
and production.
The colour word learning shown here suggests both comprehension and production at a much earlier age than has been
previously shown. By 24 months, around 75% of infants have
learned the four colour terms, and around 50% were already
producing the terms. This result is in stark contrast to previous studies that suggested that at the earliest, some children

comprehended colour terms around 30 months (Sandhofer &
Smith, 1999; Pitchford & Mullen, 2002). Here, parents report
that roughly all of the children have learned the terms by this
age.
The above results make startling claims about when colour
word learning occurs. However, parental surveys have long
been called into question, particularly in the case of measuring comprehension (Tomasello & Mervis, 1994; HoustonPrice et al., 2007). Additionally, the parental reports only
contain data from the four basic colour terms, which may not
capture the full picture of colour word learning. In order to
test the veracity of the claims made by the parental questionnaire, and to expand the scope of colours used from four to
six, a second study was designed, using eye tracking data.

Procedure Participants were seated on the lap of the caregiver, around 75cm from the eye tracker and presentation
screen. Participants first completed a nine-point calibration
sequence, and following that the trials began. In each trial,
participants saw an attractive attention-getter for 2 seconds,
and then were presented with two objects. The objects were
identical in every way, except for colour. The objects on the
screen were coloured one of red, blue, green, yellow, black,
or white. All colours were considered to be typical examples
of that colour category by three independent observers, and
not too dark or light. 2 seconds after the test objects appeared
on the screen, participants heard a colour term corresponding
to one of the objects, in the format of “look, red,” “look at the
red one” or “look at the red chair.” The objects that made up
the stimuli were all regular items that would be seen around
the household by the infants, such as furniture or items of
clothing. The trial would continue for another 5 seconds after
colour label onset.
Each participant saw 18 trials, 3 of each colour, and all
trials were left right randomised. Presentation was counter-

Eye-tracking Study
Method
Participants N = 146 participants were recruited for this
study, either online or from the local maternity ward. A further N = 23 participants were excluded for fussiness or for
failing to complete the experiment, while N = 5 participants
were excluded from the experiment for failing to complete at
least one trial with each colour as both target and distractor.
Full participant information can be seen in Table 3. Participants were in 5 age groups, with the oldest age group as a
control group who have likely learned colour words (and thus
were not selected to be a specific age), and the youngest age
group a control group who likely have not yet learned colour
terms. All participants were monolingual and were learning
English as their first language.

curve, using the function glmmPQL, with quartic orthogonal
polynomials (Mirman, 2014), with a random effect of subject.
Age and time were treated as continuous numeric variables,
and target colour was dummy coded. Rather than modelling
the raw data, which allows infant colour preferences to override the effect of the label, trials were aggregated for each
participant, such that the proportion of looks to target was defined by using the target and distractor for the same colour
i:
Proportion =

TargetLooks(i)
TargetLooks(i) + DistractorLooks(i)

Results
Figure 3: A typical trial as seen by participants.

The fitted model can be seen in Figure 4. The results indicate
that there is very little colour word understanding at either 12
or 16 months, but by 19 months most of the participants understand all six colour words being examined. The effect of
the label becomes more defined in the 24 month age group,
until almost all participants react to the colour label by looking to the target in the 48 month group. The key fixation
period is during the first two seconds after label onset. After
that initial effect of the target label, it is likely that the infants
return to random looking or looking by preference.

balanced so that any pairing that participants saw with one of
the stimuli (e.g. the red chair) as a target, they would then see
again with that as a distractor, and the stimulus that had been
the distractor (e.g. the white chair) then became the target.
All stimuli were presented on a neutral grey background, and
trials were presented in a randomised order. Infant fixations
were recorded using a Tobii eye tracker sampling at 120Hz.
The data was modelled with a hierarchical binomial growth

The results of this experiment also show that there is very
little difference in the word learning of individual colour
terms. Over the three month period between 16 months and
19 months, infants progress from knowing little of any of the
colour terms to displaying some abilities in all of them. This
shows that any differences in colour word learning must be of
a smaller difference than three months.
The model output showed a significant effect of all four
polynomials (p < 0.0001), of age (p < 0.0001) and of the
interaction between age and each of the polynomials (p <
0.0001). The differences between colour terms had no significant effects on the model output (all p > 0.05). This suggests that general patterns of looking at the target vary over
the course of the trial by age, but do not really vary by colour.
Finally, the proportion of looks to the target was collapsed
so that for each colour and each participant any participant
with a proportion of looks to target over 0.55 (above chance)
in the first two seconds after target word onset were coded
as “looking to target,” while any participant looking at a proportion lower than 0.55 were coded as “not looking.” These
answers were then compared with the responses given by parents in the Oxford CDI for those participants by way of a Chisquared test with Yates’ continuity correction. N = 6 participants were excluded from this analysis as they did not fill
out the Oxford CDI. Results showed a significant relationship between CDI answers and infants performance in the
eye-tracking task, χ2 (1, N = 560) = 22.974, p < 0.0001.

ipants at 16 months, while at 19 months all were learned.
This suggests that there is a great deal of consistency as to
when colour words are learned, and follow the assertion of
Mervis et al. (1995) that following the learning of the first
colour term, others quickly follow.
The results of the present study show that colour word
learning occurs as young as 18 months, significantly earlier
than has been shown by previous studies (Kowalski & Zimiles, 2006; O’Hanlon & Roberson, 2006; Pitchford & Mullen,
2002; Sandhofer & Smith, 1999; Soja, 1994). However, both
elements of the present study only addressed typical examples
of the colours in question, not a full adult-like understanding
of colour terms. Previous studies focussed on atypical examples of the colour categories in order to examine colour
word learning, but evidence presented here suggests that it is
highly likely that this may have led to an underestimation, as
the participants may have understood typical examples, but
been unable to extend the colour categories in the same way
an adult would (Wagner et al., 2013).
In the present study evidence is given for an early comprehension around 19 months of age, in contrast to this, Wagner
et al. (2013, 2014) have shown that errors are still consistently made by participants around three years of age when
presented with atypical examples of the colour category. This
suggests that colour words are learned slowly over a long period of time, where an early comprehension precedes production, and that comprehension develops slowly until they have
achieved an adult-like understanding (Wagner et al., 2014).
In this sense, colour words behave the same as other classes
of word, including concrete nouns (Andersen, 1975), where
children begin with typical examples of the word, but take
time to learn the words closer to the boundary (Wagner et al.,
2014; Yurovsky, Wagner, Barner, & Frank, 2015). Often the
examples closer to the category boundary could be learned
after production, while the typical examples will be learned
before production. Very similar examples have been seen in
the case of time words (Tillman & Barner, 2015), where children understand the order of time words, but not the exact
meaning until much later.
The present study also compared the results of a parental
report with those of an experimental eye-tracking study. The
eye-tracking data successfully corroborates the results of the
parental reports, with results suggesting a close relationship
between both measures. Measuring comprehension through
the use of questionnaires has long been questioned (HoustonPrice et al., 2007; Tomasello & Mervis, 1994), despite evidence that it is a successful measure of comprehension at
least in the case of object labels (Dale, 1991; Styles & Plunkett, 2009). The data evidenced here suggests that parents estimate colour word comprehension conservatively, possibly
due to comprehension of a colour term being more abstract
and thus harder to observe than a more concrete term. Even
in the abstract case of colour terms, parental reports provide a
useful estimate of comprehension, but parents are sensitive to
small improvements that children make in their vocabularies

General Discussion
Two experiments were presented in order to measure colour
word learning, the first using parental reports of whether their
children were understanding and producing the terms, the
second an experimental study using eye-tracking to measure
whether infants looked to the coloured object upon hearing
the colour label. Both methods have shown that there is early
comprehension of colour terms, before 24 months in many
participants according to the CDI results. The purpose of the
second study was to verify the early comprehension that was
evidenced in the parental reports. In the parental reports, the
majority of participants were thought to have comprehended
all four colour terms in the Oxford CDI by around 24 months.
At 19 months, however, only 25% of participants were reported to have understood the colour terms. It is clear from
the eye-tracking data that there is some understanding of the
colour terms already by 19 months. Not only does the experimental evidence confirm that colour words are learned early,
but it suggests that parents may in fact be underestimating
how much their children know with respect to colour terms.
The results of each study showed that although there
maybe patterns in the order of acquisition of colour terms in
English, the differences between those colour terms are not
great – in the parental reports green was seen to be significantly behind the other three colour terms, but only by a difference of around a month, while in the eye-tracking study,
none of the colours were learned by the majority of partic-

371

at a young age, and as such this captures comprehension at an
early stage of the process. While parental reports are found
here to be largely consistent with CDI reports of their understanding of these individual terms, little is known about how
the rest of the colour vocabulary will develop after they learn
their first few terms.
Colour words in many respects behave like other classes of
words; they are learned early, but it takes infants some time to
establish where the boundaries are located, and find an adultlike definition. We have provided strong evidence that colour
word comprehension occurs much earlier than thought, preceding production and slowly developing for a number of
years. It is worth noting all participants in this study were
British monolingual infants and toddlers, learning English.
The order and timing of early comprehension of colour words
at this stage is only known for British English; it remains to be
seen whether the same trends apply to colour word learning
globally.
