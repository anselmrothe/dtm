Abstract

English speakers use two spatial reference frames for
talking about time: ego-moving, which depicts the agent as
actively moving through time-space (e.g., “we are
approaching retirement”) and time-moving, which depicts
the agent as stationary while events in time move toward
them (as in, “the holiday season is approaching”). In the
ambiguous ‘Wednesday’s meeting’ question, the implied
vector of motion (forward) differs depending on which
frame you adopt – toward (time-moving) versus away from
(ego-moving) the individual – such that the meeting could
now be interpreted as falling either on Monday (timemoving) or Friday (ego-moving). Boroditsky found that egoand time-moving spatial primes reliably biased participant
responses to the ambiguous question in a metaphorcongruent manner, suggesting that people were relying on
active spatial representations to reason about time (see also
McGlone & Harding, 1998).
This basic pattern of results has been replicated and
extended in many ways, from the use of more ecologically
valid spatial primes (Boroditsky & Ramscar, 2002), to nonlinguistic measures of temporal reasoning (Casasanto, 2005;
Casasanto & Boroditsky, 2008), to cross-cultural
comparisons (Boroditsky, Fuhrman, & McCormick, 2010).
These data offer converging support for the view that people
(frequently) represent and reason about time using their
knowledge of space, and that the specific spatial relations
that are mapped onto the domain of time are shaped by
patterns of metaphor in language (along with other factors
like writing direction and cultural values; Boroditsky, 2011;
Casasanto, 2016; Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013).
While research has been largely focused on showing links
between space and time in the mind, scant attention has
been given to whether metaphors influence how people
reason about real world events in the future. Do people
conceptualize impending events differently when they are
described using different spatial metaphors for time?
To address this question, we conducted a large-scale
linguistic framing study to assess how people think about
negative outcomes associated with climate change. We
chose climate change because it is a real-world problem
laden with uncertainty. In general, people have a very poor

People often use spatial language to talk about time, and this
is known to both reflect and shape how they think about it.
Despite much research on the spatial grounding of temporal
language and thought, little attention has been given to how
spatial metaphors influence reasoning about real events,
especially those in the future. In a large online study
(N=2362), we framed a discussion of climate change using
spatial metaphors that varied on reference-frame (ego- vs.
time-moving), speed of movement (fast vs. slow), and time
horizon (near, medium, or far future). We found that
describing climate change as approaching (time-moving
frame) – versus something we approach – made the issue
seem more serious, but also more tractable, at least when the
rate of motion was fast (e.g., “it’s rapidly approaching”).
These findings offer novel insights into the relationship
between spatial metaphors and temporal reasoning and how
we communicate about uncertain future events.

Introduction
People often talk about time in terms of space (Clark,
1973; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). Two holidays can be
described as close together, and deadlines, as rapidly
approaching. Spatiotemporal metaphors, which underlie
such talk, are ubiquitous across cultures (Boroditsky, 2011;
Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013). What’s more, much research
has established that we actually mentally represent and
reason about time in terms of space as well, and that this
happens in a manner that is consistent with the particular
language we use (Boroditsky, 2000, 2011; Boroditsky &
Ramscar, 2002; Casasanto, 2005; Casasanto & Boroditsky,
2008; Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013; but see Casasanto,
2016).
A popular method for assessing this claim is to
manipulate how someone is thinking about space before
asking them to reason about time. In one early study, for
example, Boroditsky (2000) showed participants spatial
primes that depicted an agent moving towards a goal or an
object moving toward an agent, and then asked them to
answer an ambiguous temporal question: “Next
Wednesday's meeting has been moved forward two days.
Which day is the meeting now that its been moved?”.

Experiment

understanding of what climate change is, what the specific
outcomes will be, and what to do about it (see Barnosky et
al., 2017). We reasoned that this inherent ambiguity might
make it easier to observe the effects of spatiotemporal
metaphors on how people think and feel about the issue
since people’s prior beliefs may be somewhat nebulous.
In our experiment, participants first read a brief article
about US efforts to tackle climate change, and then
responded to questions about how serious and tractable they
viewed the issue. We manipulated whether the report
described climate change with the ego- or time-moving
reference-frame, whether speed of movement in time-space
was fast or slow, and whether US conservation goals were
situated in a relatively near, medium, or far future time
horizon.
We hypothesized that using a time-moving reference
frame would make the effects of climate change seem more
urgent and serious, since this perspective represents the
individual as fixed in place, unable to control the arrival of a
negative future event. This would be consistent with prior
research showing that people who spontaneously adopt a
time-moving perspective tend to show higher levels of state
and trait anxiety and depression, which are associated with a
loss in feelings of agency (Richmond, Wilson, & Zinken,
2012).
However, this increase in feelings of urgency does not
imply an increase in pessimism about the tractability of the
issue. In fact, it could be the case that the time-moving
frame might lead people to view climate change as a more
tractable problem, given that the individual is free to engage
in their own actions on this construal (since they are not
occupied with the task of moving through time). This would
resonate with research showing that people who
spontaneously adopt the time-moving reference frame
procrastinate less and are more conscientiousness than those
who spontaneously adopt the ego-moving reference frame.
(Duffy & Feist, 2014; Duffy, Feist, & McCarthy, 2014).
One way of thinking about this is that the decrease in
feelings of control (and increase in anxiety) that results from
the time-moving frame might lead to a compensatory
counter-response, such that people would now be motivated
to believe that personal actions are likely to be effective in
addressing the problem. In other words, when it feels like
you cannot stop a future event from happening, you will feel
better if you consequently believe that at least you can deal
it when it arrives.
We included the speed manipulation to assess whether the
“rate” at which we approach future events (or they approach
us) might affect or interact with the temporal reference
frame in shaping these attitudes towards climate change. It
is plausible, for instance, that faster “motion” would be
associated with a greater sense of urgency. The time horizon
manipulation was included in part to affect perceptions of
whether the US seemed likely to achieve the conservation
milestones in the article, which allowed us to assess effects
of the other spatial metaphors independently of this
judgment (see Flusberg, Matlock, & Thibodeau, in press).

Methods
Participants A total of 2400 participants were recruited and
paid through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for the study in
the Spring of 2016 (Berinsky, Huber, & Lenz, 2012;
Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). We restricted our
sample to people living in the US who had a good
performance rating (>90%) on previous Turk tasks. Data
was not analyzed from 38 participants who did not complete
the study (i.e. from participants who did not submit a valid
completion code), leaving a sample size of N = 2362. The
sample was 46% male and had a mean age of 35.2 years (SD
= 11.1).
Materials & Procedure Participants read a brief fictional
article that described US efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. It used (1) an ego- or time-moving frame of
reference; (2) temporal language about climate change as a
slow or fast process (speed), and (3) identified an outcome
on a time horizon in the relatively near (2025), medium
(2040), or distant future (2115).
As shown in Figure 1, the report began, “In response to
the recent Paris Climate Talks, the Associated Press release
the following brief statement.” The title was presented
below this heading in capital letters. The rest of the passage
was an appeal for addressing climate change and identified a
specific goal for the US: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
by more than 30% by 2025, 2040, or 2115.

Data Reduction. As expected, the dependent measures
were correlated with one another. As shown in Table 1, the
six measures clustered into two groups: there was a high
correlation (a) between the goal judgment, assessment of
whether climate change would be solved, and whether the
consequences of climate change were inevitable (rs > .19),
and (b) between the measures of urgency, risk perception,
and willingness to change one’s behavior (rs > .5).

Target and Background Questions. After reading the
article, participants answered question about whether they
thought the US would achieve its climate reduction goal in
the stated time frame (i.e., by 2025, 2040, or 2115). Then
they answered questions about whether they thought the
problems of climate change would be solved, whether the
disastrous effects of climate change were inevitable at this
point, how urgent it is for the US to implement energy
reduction programs, and how much risk they perceived to be
associated with climate change. Participants also answered
questions about their willingness to change their own
behavior to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (see Figure 2).

To further investigate the relationship among dependent
measures, we did an exploratory factor analysis: a principal
components analysis, using singular value decomposition
(Mardia, Kent, & Bibby, 1980). Principal components
analysis (PCA) extracts the common variance in measures
that are conceptually and empirically related (Dunteman,
1989). The analysis revealed, based on the Kaiser criterion
and an analysis of the Scree plot, two major underlying
sources of variance in the data, consistent with the pairwise
correlations in Table 1. As shown in Table 2, the first factor
loaded most heavily on the measures of urgency, risk
perception, and willingness to change. The second loaded
most heavily on the goal judgment, whether people thought
climate change would be solved, and whether they thought
the consequences of climate change were inevitable.
To analyze the data parsimoniously, we created two
composite outcome variables based on the clustering of
dependent measures found in the pairwise correlations and
exploratory factor analysis. We combined the first three
questions, using PCA, into a measure of how tractable
participants considered the problem of climate change, and
the last three questions into a measure of how serious
participants considered the problem of climate change (see
Table 2 for weights used to create the composite measures).
The composite measures captured the majority of the
variance in the raw data: the measure of how tractable

Most dependent measures were rated on a 5-point scale.
One exception was the measure of risk perception, recorded
on an 8-point slide bar. The measure of risk perception
included 13 items (Cronbach’s α = .93). The measure of
behavioral intentions included six items (Cronbach’s α =
.87). All other dependent measures were a single question.

reference (ego- versus time-moving) and speed (fast versus
slow) were treated as factors.
To account for the primary source of variance in the
dependent measures, we included participants’ belief in the
anthropogenic origins of climate change as a covariate,
although this did not affect the reliability of the results. To
address secondary research questions (e.g., who is affected
by manipulating the reference frame?), we tested for 2-way
interactions between the experimental manipulations and
participants’ belief in global warming.

Serious The results of a model in which the Frame of
reference (ego- or time-moving), speed (fast or slow), and
time horizon (2025, 2040, or 2115), as well as participants’
belief in global warming, were used to predict how serious
people consider climate change to be (see Table 3). The
strongest predictor of seriousness was participants’ belief in
global warming. People who recognized the anthropogenic
origins of climate change thought the issue was more
urgent, recognized more risk, and were more willing to
change their behavior to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The model also revealed a main effect of the frame of
reference, qualified by an interaction with participants’
belief in global warming. Overall, participants were more
likely to think of climate change as an urgent issue with
important risks worthy of behavior change in the timemoving condition (M = .06, SD = 1.44), compared to the
ego-moving condition (M = -.05, SD = 1.52). This was
especially true for people who were skeptical about the
anthropogenic origins of climate change, likely due to a
ceiling effect on this measure for non-skeptics.

There was a moderate correlation between the two
composite measures (tractable and serious), r(2360) = .12,
p < .001 (in contrast, pc1 and pc2 are orthogonal), and both
were positively correlated with participants’ belief in global
warming: tractable, r(2360) = .14, p < .001; solvable,
r(2360) = .66, p < 001.

Results
Analysis We conducted our primary hypothesis tests on the
two composite measures (i.e. how tractable and serious
people consider climate change to be). We also analyzed the
six dependent measures separately in exploratory follow-up
analyses. For each analysis, an initial omnibus betweensubjects ANOVA is presented with tests for main effects of
and interactions between the three experimental
manipulations. We show the results of the two ANOVAs,
along with the coefficients from the corresponding linear
regression models in Tables 3 and 4. Time horizon (2025,
2040, 2115) was treated as an ordinal variable; frame of

We created the composite outcome measures using two
separate PCAs because we wanted the outcome measures to clearly
reflect participants’ responses to the original questions. For
example, as shown in Table 2, pc1 primarily reflects variability in
judgments of urgency, risk perception, and willingness to change
one’s behavior, but it also loads onto the other three judgments;
pc2 loads positively on the first two questions (goal and solvable)
and negatively on the remaining four (inevitable, urgent, risk,
behavioral intentions). These patterns of weighting the original
questions present some difficulty in interpreting what each factor
actually reflects (e.g., pc2 mostly reflects an optimistic outlook
regarding our capacity to address climate change, but also, to a
lesser degree, reflects the inverse of judgments of urgency, risk
perception, and willingness to change one’s behavior). In contrast,
conducting separate principal components analyses—one on the
first three questions, one on the last three questions—yields two
outcome variables that clearly correspond to the original questions:
tractable is tightly correlated with the three questions used to
create it (goal, r = .73; solvable, r = .80; inevitable, r = -.64) and
only slightly correlated with the other three questions (urgency, r =
.10; risk perception, r = .09; behavior, r = .10); serious is tightly
correlated with the three questions used to create it (urgency, r =
.83; risk perception, r = .82; behavior, r = .85), and only slightly
correlated with the other three questions (goal, r = .18; solvable, r
= -.02; inevitable, r = -.11).

Separate analyses on “raw” questions about urgency, risk
perception, and behavioral intentions yielded consistent
results. For example, people reported perceiving more risk
in the time-moving reference frame, B = .43, SE = .20, p =
.032. Perceptions of risk were related to beliefs about global
warming, B = 1.01, SE = .04, p < .001. These predictors also

364

interacted, B = -.12, SE = .05, p = .029, suggesting that the
effect of the reference frame most strongly affected people
who reported skepticism about climate science.
Finally, the exploratory analyses of participants’
responses to questions of urgency, risk perception, and
behavioral intentions suggested that one effect was
obscured by analyzing the composite measure: of speed on
perceptions of urgency. Participants reported that global
warming was a more urgent issue to address when the
language suggested that the climate was changing quickly, B
= .27, SE = .14, p = .049, regardless of time horizon or
frame of reference.

among participants who reported the strongest belief in
climate science (a score greater than 4 on the measure of
belief in global warming; n = 668), there was no effect of
the time horizon manipulation (M2025 = .10, SD = 1.22;
M2040 = .10, SD = 1.40; M2115 = .19, SD = 1.35), F(1, 194) =
0.36, p = .551. In other words, people who reported a belief
in climate science tended to be optimistic about the issue,
regardless of the time horizon of the goal, whereas people
who were skeptical about climate science were more likely
to think the issue would be solved on a more distant time
horizon.

How Tractable is Climate Change?

Tractable The results of a model in which the Frame of
reference (ego- or time-moving), speed (fast or slow), and
time horizon (2025, 2040, or 2115), as well as participants’
belief in global warming, were used to predict judgments
related to how tractable people consider climate change to
be (see Table 4). Consistent with the analysis of how
serious people consider the issue, the strongest predictor in
the model was participants’ belief in global warming.
People who recognized the anthropogenic origins of climate
change were more optimistic about being able to address the
problem, probably due to the fact they are the ones who
think it is a problem in the first place. There was also a main
effect of the time horizon manipulation: people considered
the issue more tractable when the specific goal was situated
in the distant, as opposed to the near, future.

The omnibus test also revealed a marginal interaction
between the speed manipulation (whether the effects of
climate change were described as happening quickly or
slowly) and the frame of reference (ego- or time-moving).
As shown in Figure 3, there was an effect of the reference
frame when the report described the effects of climate
change as occurring quickly (but not slowly). In the fast
speed condition, participants were more optimistic about
solving climate change on the time-moving reference frame
compared to the ego-moving reference frame, t(1160) =

Discussion
Time is highly abstract, but people manage to talk and
think about it by drawing on spatial language and
knowledge (Boroditsky, 2011). In this paper, we examined
how particular spatial metaphors used to describe uncertain
future outcomes would affect how people think about an
important issue. So, instead of focusing on whether people
reason about time using spatial representations, we looked at
how different spatial construals would affect how they think
about a real-world event. In a large online study, we framed
a discussion of US efforts to tackle climate change using
spatial metaphors that varied according to reference-frame

Finally, there was an interaction between participants’
belief in global warming and the time horizon. The effect of
the time horizon manipulation was driven by participants
who were more skeptical about climate science. For
example, among participants who reported the most
skepticism about climate change (a score less than 2 on the
measure of belief in global warming; n = 196), there was a
relatively large effect of the time horizon manipulation
(M2025 = -.75, SD = 1.34; M2040 = -.57, SD = 1.44; M2115 = .11, SD = 1.31), F(1, 194) = 8.652, p = .004. In contrast,

365

(ego- vs. time-moving), speed of movement (fast vs. slow),
and time horizon (near, medium, or far future).
People appeared to be more optimistic about solutions for
climate change with a more distant time horizon (implying
there would be more time to address it). This was especially
true for people who were skeptical of climate science, which
probably reflects a ceiling effect for those who are more
inclined to accept the scientific consensus.
More interestingly, and consistent with our initial
hypothesis, climate change seemed more serious and urgent
when described with a time-moving metaphor than with an
ego-moving metaphor. This supports the view that talking
about uncertain future events as approaching of their own
accord may be associated with additional anxiety
surrounding the issue. Because this effect was actually most
pronounced for people who were skeptical about climate
science (again suggesting a ceiling effect for non-skeptics),
this finding may have important practical applications for
policy makers and climate science communicators. We also
observed some suggestion that metaphorical speed affects
this sense of urgency, such that fast “motion” language
makes people think the issue is more urgent.
Also consistent with our initial prediction, the reference
frame appeared to affect perceptions of the tractable-ness of
the issue of climate change, though only when the process
was described as happening quickly: people felt the issue
was more tractable on the time-moving reference frame
when climate change was said to be occurring rapidly. This
may arise from the increased sense of urgency and risk
surrounding the issue on the time-moving frame – to
effectively compensate for this increase in existential
anxiety, people may come to view the problem as something
they can actually address through concerted action.
Though preliminary, these findings have shed some new
light on how metaphor can affect reasoning – both in
general and for an issue with real world consequences.
Taking a nuanced approach like this to investigating
metaphor has the potential to advance our understanding of
how metaphor works in the context of communicating about
real world problems.
