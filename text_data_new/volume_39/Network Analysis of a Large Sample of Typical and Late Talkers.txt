Abstract
The focus of this paper is to examine differences in semantic
network structure of late talkers and typical talkers to elucidate
potential learning strategies used by late talking children. To
address this question, we conducted network analysis on the
vocabularies of 2,912 children, with 566 of those being late
talkers. Contrary to previously reported findings, the results
show that late talkers have well-connected vocabularies as
measured by median degree, clustering coefficient, and mean
distance, with more well-connected networks in some cases
than their typical talking peers. Further analysis of word order
suggests that late talkers may be selecting based on frequency
and connectivity of the words in the learning environment,
more so than typical talkers. The language processing
difficulties in late talkers appear not to be associated with their
semantic network properties. In sum, late talkers may initially
benefit from using word frequency and word connectivity
strategies to build well-connected vocabularies.

Introduction
Children start learning words within the first and second year
of life. Some children are slower than others, and some of
the slowest children go on to show lifelong learning
difficulties. These children, called late talkers, have been the
subject of extensive research, both to understand how they
learn but also to understand how their learning might be
better facilitated to prevent lifelong problems. One of the
outstanding questions in late talker research is to what extent
late talkers are simply ‘slower’ versions of typical talkers?
The alternative is that they show different learning strategies
and therefore not only learn words more slowly but learn
different words. In the present work we address this question
using network analysis on the largest currently available
sample of children’s vocabularies. The aim is that by
identifying similarities and differences in vocabulary
acquisition, we can better identify the strategies that late
talkers might be using, if indeed they are using strategies
different from typical talkers. Before we explain our
methods, we first briefly review the literature on network
analysis and late talkers.

Network Analysis in Language Acquisition
Semantic network analysis has allowed researchers to
explore language processing in adults (Wachs-Lopes &
Rodrigues, 2016) and language acquisition in children (Hills,

Maouene, Riordan & Smith, 2010; Hills, Maouene,
Maouene, Sheya & Smith, 2009). In network analysis, also
known as graph theory, words are modelled as vertices and
relationships between words are modelled as edges. Semantic
relatedness amongst words is the focus of the present study,
however, other relationships have been used in the past,
including features, phonology, and free associations (e.g., Li
, Farkas & MacWhinney, 2004, Hills, Maouene, Maouene,
Sheya & Smith, 2009).
According to Watts & Strogatz (1988) small world
networks are “highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have
small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs”. Smallworld properties have been reported not only in adult
vocabulary but also in toddlers as young as 15 months
(Beckage, Smith, & Hills, 2011). Local structure, where
words are connected in clusters, may represent semantic
categories (Hills, Maouene, Maouene, Sheya & Smith,
2009b). Words between clusters may facilitate transitions
between clusters, and therefore are believed to be critical in
language processing (Cancho & Solé, 2001; Banavar,
Maritan & Rinaldo, 1999).
Networks statistics can be computed to evaluate the
connectivity of a lexical network. Three of them are
considered in this work. The degree of a word is the number
of ties that word has with other words. Calculating the mean
or median of this measure provides the overall level of
cohesion in a network. The clustering coefficient explores the
degree of clustering of nodes within a network. Finally, the
mean distance of a network shows the average of the shortest
paths between all pairs of words which gives an idea of its
global access. Many studies have included these statistics in
their analysis to examine research questions related to
language acquisition, e.g. studies on lexical growth (Hills,
Maouene, Riordan & Smith, 2010), categorical memberships
in the lexicon (Hills, Maouene, Maouene, Sheya & Smith,
2009b), and the influence of bilingual first-language learning
on early English acquisition (Bilson, Yoshida, Tran, Woods
& Hills, 2015).

Language Acquisition in Typical and Late Talkers
Extensive research has already taken place around those
children with small vocabularies compared to their normed
peers (for a review, see Desmarais, Sylvestre, Meyer, Bairati
& Rouleau, 2008). Whereas many late talkers catch up with
their peers in word production (so called ‘late bloomers’;
Thal, Tobias & Morrison,1991), some others will have
language difficulties that drag on, to be later diagnosed with
Specific Language Impairment (SLI) (Leonard, 2000). For

2302

the latter group, language problems will continue with
comprehension, production and/or pragmatics (Leonard,
2000). Despite late bloomers’ vocabulary improvement, they
may still be more likely to experience difficulties in
language-related tasks, such as reading (Rescorla, 2009).
Defining and understanding the characteristics and strategies
of late talker’s vocabulary could help to develop effective
early interventions.
The starting point for our research is Beckage, Smith and
Hills (2011). In their study, network analysis was used to
characterize the vocabularies of 66 typical and late talking
children. Semantic relatedness of words, computed from
word co-occurrence derived from the CHILDES database
(MacWhinney, 2000), was used to connect the words in the
child’s vocabulary. Results showed that both typical and late
talkers exhibit small-world structure, although late talkers
present this to a lesser degree. The study suggests the
existence of a relationship between the child’s rate of lexical
development and the connectivity of her individual network.
This finding led the authors to hypothesize the possibility of
an ‘oddball’ strategy used by late talkers: a preference to
learn words that have lower semantic relatedness with words
they already know. Thus, late talkers may use different
learning strategies or have differences in their ability to
discriminate word referents.
A later study by Nematzadeh, Fazly & Stevenson (2014)
challenged these results. By means of computational
modelling, the authors simulated typical and late talking word
learners to explore differences in their semantic networks.
Surprisingly, neither type of simulated word learner showed
a small-world structure. Referring to Beckage, Smith and
Hills’ work (2011), the authors questioned the use of the same
edges to link words of the networks of both typical and late
talkers as it assumes that both groups learn the same
knowledge about words. Moreover, the authors called into
question the ‘oddball strategy’ alleging that late talking
children do not possess enough information about the words
to discern similarities and dissimilarities between words.
However, their methodological differences may also explain
the differences in the results. Whereas in Beckage, Smith and
Hills’ study (2011) the co-occurrence of words in childdirected speech generated semantic relatedness between
words, Nematzadeh, Fazly & Stevenson (2014) used
associative semantic information provided by a custom
lexicon to link words with similar meanings.
Word frequency has also been investigated as one of the
main influences in word learning. In Stokes (2010), two-year
old typical talking children tended to acquire more high
frequency words than late talking children, who in turn
learned more words with a higher phonological
neighborhood density. However, the question remains
whether there is a difference between the two groups with
respect to preferences for acquiring some words earlier than
others, which may have given a different perspective of the
learning strategies used by each group.
The present work further investigates the difference
between early and late talkers using vocabularies taken from

the open repository website Wordbank (Frank, Braginsky,
Yurovsky & Marchman, in press), providing a sample of
2,912 children, of which 566 are considered late talkers. The
methodology followed and the words selected are identical to
those in Beckage, Smith and Hills (2011), the only
differences being the number of children and the diversity of
their backgrounds as they come from nine different American
studies. Our principle question is, how does the semantic
vocabulary structure differ between typical and late talkers?
We ask two additional questions: (1) what is the relationship
between word frequency and order of word learning for the
two groups, and (2) what is the relationship between word
frequency in the language learning environment and the
connectivity between the words. These allow us to investigate
additional pathways for language learning in late talkers.

Methods
Vocabulary
Publicly available vocabulary data for 5,450 children aged 16
to 30 months was downloaded on October 2016 from
Wordbank (Frank et al., in press). Data is contributed by
various
researchers
using
the
MacArthur-Bates
Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) (Fenson,
Dale & Reznick, 1993). The data set used in this work was
downloaded by selecting ‘Words & Sentences’ under forms
and ‘English’ under language. To facilitate comparisons
between late and typical talkers, we limited vocabulary sizes
to between 20 and 220 words, a range where typical and late
talkers overlapped that also allowed for meaningful network
statistics. Few late talkers had a productive vocabulary size
greater than 220 words. After limiting the vocabulary size,
the final total number of children remaining was 2,912. Of
the 2,912 children (aged 15 to 30 months), 566 have a
vocabulary size atypical for their age and 2,346 presented a
normal vocabulary size for their age. Late talkers were at or
under the 20th percentile of their same-age peers. To calculate
this, each child was assigned to a decile grouping according
to their age and vocabulary size reported in the MCDI
instrument. The decile grouping was looked up from a table
of estimated percentiles on the Wordbank website created
using a quartile regression with monotonic polynomial spline
as the base function. Although the total number of words that
can be recorded in the MCDI questionnaire is 680, in
Beckage, Smith and Hills’ study (2011) only 291 words were
used which appeared on both the toddler and infant forms,
allowing comparison across ages. The same words were
selected in this study. The 291 words consist of 207 nouns,
50 verbs, 14 adjectives, 12 pronouns, 6 adverbs, 1 quantifier
and 1 demonstrative. All categories in the MCDI were
included except for ‘Sound Effects and Animal Sounds’,
‘Helping Verbs’, and ‘Connecting Words’.

Semantic Relationships Between the Words
To link the words in each child’s productive vocabulary,
semantic relatedness between words was computed using co-

2303

occurrence statistics derived from an American English
corpus of child-directed speech, CHILDES (MacWhinney,
2000). A surface proximity approach (see
Evert, 2008) was used to determine the
20-40
frequency in which each distinct word (node)
in the corpus co-occurred with other words LT
133
(collocates). An empty co-occurrences matrix
(23)
427
was created and then populated by moving a TT
(17.1)
window of span size 5 words forward through Total
560
the corpus. As co-occurrences were
encountered the count for that pair was incremented. A subset
of this large matrix was created where the rows and columns
intersected with the 291 words selected from the MCDI
forms. Finally, the count values were converted to a simple
binary representation.

Random Acquisition Networks
In order to compare each individual child’s network with
similar size networks, 300 random acquisition networks were
generated for each child. These networks have the same
number of words n as the child’s network, but the words are
selected randomly from the set of 291 words. Then, each
random network was linked using the values from the
CHILDES matrix explained above. The same statistical
properties computed for each child’s vocabulary network
were also computed on the 300 random acquisition networks
and then averaged. These random network statistics provide
the structure inherent in the language context without
including the particular word learning pattern of the child,
thus providing a point of comparison for each child’s
network, allowing us to compare children with different size
vocabularies against a ‘random’ learner.

Word Frequency and Connectivity
Preferences for learning certain words over others was
assessed with respect to vocabulary size. First, the sample
was divided into two groups: late talkers and typical talkers.
Then each group was ordered by increasing vocabulary size,
creating subgroups. Within each subgroup and for each word
a count was made of children that produced the word. Words
were ranked based on their count. Differences in ranking
between late and typical talkers was calculated by subtracting
the respective ranking value for each word, allowing us to
identify differences between the groups in their preference
for learning certain words.
Only words with a minimum ranking difference of 20 or
more are presented, but the results are not sensitive to this
number. The frequency of each word was taken from
CHILDES and compared between the two groups (see
MacWhinney, 2000; Li & Shirai, 2000). Within the 291 x 291
matrix of co-occurrences, some words are better connected
(have higher degree) than others. This was calculated directly
from the matrix by counting the total number of occurrences
of a word with other words.

Results
Network Analysis
Analysis was carried out using R and the igraph package,
version 1.0.1 (Csárdi & Nepusz, 2006). Connectivity was
assessed by computing three statistics of each directed
network: median in-degree, clustering coefficient, and mean
distance. Late talkers are unequally distributed across the
sample: they have higher representation at lower vocabulary
sizes and low or no representation at the higher vocabulary
sizes. Therefore, the sample was divided into bins of children
with similar vocabulary sizes in ranges of 20 words. The size
of the bin does not influence our results, but does facilitate
their visual presentation. Table 1 shows the number of late
talkers (LT) and typical talkers (TT) in each bin, as well as
the mean age in each group.
Stepwise linear mixed effects analysis (lm4 package,
version 1.1-12; Bates, Mächler, Bolker & Walker, 2015) was
performed to explore the relationship between each of the
three network statistics and type of talker. The final three
models includes vocabulary size and type of talker as fixed
effects to predict each network statistic. No collinearity of
these predictors was found (VIFs < 1.02). Intercepts were
allowed to vary across vocabulary sizes as the values of each
network statistic varies across the size contexts. The inclusion
of vocabulary size as a fixed effect allowed us to control for
network size and led to a better statistical fit. No significant
difference in the model resulted when allowing slopes to vary
by either vocabulary size or type of talker. The significant
main effect for type of talker reveals a positive relationship
between LT and median indegree (Estimate=.061, SE=.025,
p=.014). A marginal main effect for type of talker indicates
that being a late talker leads to higher clustering coefficient
(Estimate=.003, SE=.002, p=.063). A negative main effect
was observed for late talkers on mean distance (Estimate= .014, SE=.004, p=.0008). These results indicate that LT’s
vocabularies are better connected and have better global
access than TT’s vocabularies when considering all the
vocabulary sizes together.
We compared the observed networks statistics with those
from the vocabulary size-matched random acquisition
networks by calculating ratios (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Linear
mixed effect analysis was also carried out to examine the
relationship between these ratios and type of talker. The
model had the same structure as used in the previous analysis.

Results indicate no main effect for the type of talker on indegree ratio (Estimate=.024, SE=.014, p=.078). Significant
main effects were found on clustering coefficient
(Estimate=.009, SE=.005, p=.044) and mean distance ratios
(Estimate=-0.008, SE=0.002, p=.0007), indicating that late
talking children tend to have higher clustering coefficient and
lower mean distance in their networks.

Standardized residual plots were visually inspected for the
linear mixed models to check for homoscedasticity and
normality, and a violation of these requirements was noted.
To confirm these results, we carried out more analysis. Ttests were conducted to detect differences between LT and
TT regarding the ratio of the observed statistics to the
statistics of the size-matched RAN. Late talker’s vocabularies
have higher values of median in-degree (M= 1.28, SD= .39)
and clustering coefficient (M= 1.08, SD= .140) than typical
talking children (in-degree: M= 1.20, SD= .37), t(817) = 4.54, p < .001, d =-.22; clustering coefficient: M= 1.05, SD=
0.13), t(820) = -4.72, p= p < .001, d =-.23 ). Late talking
children also had lower values of mean distance (M= .97,
SD= .06) than typical talking children (M= .99, SD= .063),
t(815) = 5.18, p < .001, d = .25.
Further analysis using the ratio data was conducted to
check whether the same differences between LT and TT are
also observed within each bin of vocabulary size. Significant
results are signaled with an asterisk in Figures 1, 2 and 3. Late
talkers obtained higher in-degree and higher clustering
coefficient than TT in the vocabulary range 40 to 60 words.
Significant differences in mean distance were found in three
groups of vocabulary size, all of them present lower values
for LT: 40 to 60 words, 60 to 80 words, and 140 to 160 words.
The same t-test analysis in each bin was performed using only
the observed data. Apart from mean indegree, in which any
difference between the type of talkers were found, similar
results were obtained in clustering coefficient and mean
distance in the same vocabulary sizes. These results show that
LT’s vocabularies are better connected than TT’s

2305

vocabularies in certain vocabulary ranges, and also that TT
resembles their RAN more than LT do in these ranges.
Paired t-tests were conducted to compare the properties of
LT and TT networks with their corresponding size-matched
RAN. Results can be seen in Table 2. Both LT and TT
showed significantly higher values of median in-degree and
clustering coefficients and significantly lower values for
mean distance than their size-matched RAN. Thus, LT and
TT seem to present vocabularies which are well connected
and have good global access.

Additionally, we wanted to see whether word frequency in
CHILDES and the connectivity of the 291 words within our
matrix of co-occurrences are correlated. Results showed that
these two measures are strongly related (rₛ= .91, p < .001).
These results suggest that LT children may be more
susceptible to these two word properties, however only the
connectivity of the preferred words can predict the type of
talker.

Word Frequency and Connectivity
To investigate differences in the order in which LT and TT
learn words, we examined the correlation between word order
and word frequency in CHILDES. The order in which all 291
words are learned across vocabulary size is not correlated to
word frequency for either type of talker (LT: rₛ= -.10, p= .082,
TT: rₛ= -.063, p= .28). When the same analysis is performed
on each vocabulary size bin, word order in LT was
significantly related to word frequency in vocabulary sizes of
20 to 40 words (rₛ= -.13, p= .023), and 40 to 60 words (rₛ= .16, p= .006). Thus, the order in which LT learn words seems
to be related to their frequency during the first stages of
vocabulary development. Further correlation analysis
revealed a relationship between connectivity and word order
(rₛ= -.13, p= .026) in LT but not in TT (rₛ= -.11, p= .071).
Analysis on each bin shows that, only for LT, this
relationship is present in vocabulary sizes of 20 to 40 words
(rₛ= -.16, p= .008), 40 to 60 words (rₛ= -.18, p= .002), 100 to
120 words (rₛ= -.13, p= .032), 120 to 140 words (rₛ= -.13, p=
.024), 180 to 200 words (rₛ= -.12, p= .043), and 200 to 220
words (rₛ= -.12, p= .041). In view of these results, it seems
that connectivity and frequency of the 291 words are
somehow related to word order in LT but not in TT. In
addition, word connectivity seems to be more strongly related
to word order in LT than word frequency.
Further analysis considered only those words that differed
considerably in word order between LT and TT. That is, there
were some words that were learned earlier by one of the type
of talker groups compared to the other group, we refer to
them here as ‘preferred words’. Figure 4 shows significant
differences between the two types of talkers: LT learned more
words that are highly frequent in the language environment
(M= 3588, SD= 897) than TT (M= 1060, SD= 687), t(16.9) =
7.08, p < .001, d = 3.16. The connectivity within the matrix
of co-occurrences of preferred words was compared between
LT and TT. Children with language delay learn words that
are well connected in the matrix (M= 101, SD= 11.4), more
so than TT (M= 75.8, SD= 12.01), t(17.9) = 4.79, p < .001, d
= 2.14. These results are consistent with this studies analysis
of the network statistics, with LT learning more wellconnected words than TT. Results from a logistic regression
using the preferred words indicated that frequency is not a
good predictor of the type of talker (B= .007, SE=.008, p=.38,
Homes-Lemeshow R₂=.85), contrary to connectivity, which
was a significant predictor (B= .14, SE= .055, p=.009,
Homes-Lemeshow R₂=.50, 95% CI [1.06, 1.33]).

analysis in each group.

Discussion
The present study uses network analysis on a large sample of
children’s vocabulary to explore the idea that late talkers may
have a different word learning strategy than typical talkers.
Multiple results from different analysis fail to agree with the
findings in Beckage, Smith and Hills (2011). The authors
reported that children with language delay have networks
with less clustering coefficient and less mean distance than
their vocabulary size-matched RAN. Furthermore, the
authors hypothesized that this may be due to LT using an
‘oddball strategy’ to learn words, i.e. late talkers may be
attracted to those words that are not well connected in the
learning environment, as opposed to the idea of ‘preferential
acquisition’, in which the tendency is to learn earlier on the
most contextually diverse words in the learning environment
(Hills, Maouene, Riordan & Smith, 2010). However, the use
of a larger sample in this study suggested that LTs do not use
an ‘oddball strategy’, rather they seem to learn words that are
well connected in the environment.
Analysis of the frequency of these preferred words in the
learning environment showed that LT learn a good proportion
of highly frequent words earlier than TT. However, the
relationship between word frequency and language delay is
still unclear as it seems to not be a good predictor for type of
talker. Nevertheless, these results seem to contradict the
findings by Stokes (2010), who found that two-year old
typical talkers learn more high frequency words than LT do.
However, the inclusion of function words may partly explain

2306

the difference between the present study’s results and Stokes’
results as their frequency in the learning environment is
higher than open class words. The connectivity of the
preferred words within the 291 words used in the present
study indicate that LT also happened to learn well connected
words earlier.
One of the reasons behind the findings may be that late
talking child are more passively influenced by word
frequency, consequently, learning more highly frequent
words that happen to be well connected in the learning
environment. As knowing these high frequency words can
deliver a degree of communication success, the requirement
to acquire advanced strategies may be further delayed.
In sum, the evidence reported in this study suggests that
children with language delay have well connected
vocabularies and good global access, in many cases better
than the typically developing children. Late talkers may be
more influenced by word frequency or connectivity, perhaps
using a strategy to learn words that are contextually diverse
in the learning environment as noted in previous work (Hills
et al., 2009a). In order to elucidate whether these two types
of talkers are using different word learning strategies, future
research will need to examine the longitudinal development
of vocabularies in LT and TT and a different approach to
assign a more individualistic semantic relatedness between
the words.
