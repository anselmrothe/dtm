Abstract
A classic effect in the timing field is that “sounds are judged
longer than lights” (Goldstone, Boardman & Lhamon, 1959).
Recently, judgements for tactile durations have been found to
fall between the two (Jones, Poliakoff & Wells, 2009). These
modality differences are commonly interpreted within scalar
timing theory as the work of a central pacemaker which runs
faster for sounds, then vibrations, and slowest for lights
(Wearden, Edwards, Fakhri & Percival, 1998). We
investigated whether verbal estimates and temporal difference
thresholds are correlated within each modality, but found this
not to be the case. This suggests that differences in pacemaker
speed may not be the main driver for modality differences in
thresholds. In addition, we investigated sensory bias as an
alternative to the pacemaker explanation, but this was found
not to correlate with modality differences in timing.

Introduction
The timing of stimulus duration by humans has historically
been under-researched compared to other perceptual
domains. One reason is that although humans possess a very
sensitive discrimination for duration (with difference
thresholds as low as 10 ms), there is no sensory organ for
time. This forces explanations to draw on hidden processes
more heavily than for other sensory systems, such as vision
and hearing. To date the most successful models of human
timing have centred on the idea that humans possess an
internal clock of a pacemaker-accumulator type, such as in
scalar timing theory (SET: Gibbon, 1977; Gibbon, Church
& Meck, 1984). The pacemaker generates internal events
(‘pulses’ or ‘ticks’) which are connected to an accumulator
via a switch. The accumulator contents increase linearly
with the duration being estimated and forms the basis for
timing judgments (further memory and decision modules are
also typically added to this clock model – see Gibbon et al.,
1984).
Support for the idea of a pacemaker-accumulator internal
clock comes from several sources. People (and animals) can
stop and start timing like a stopwatch, even managing to
‘pause’ timing and continue after a short gap (Buhusi &
Meck, 2009). In addition, people can perform ordinality
judgements, express one duration as a proportion of another,
and average durations together, again suggesting a linear
relationship between perceived time and real time (Wearden
& Jones, 2007).
Furthermore, it appears the speed of the internal clock can
be altered. A key signature of a change in pacemaker speed

is the ‘slope effect’. In verbal estimation1 tasks, when the
stimulus durations are plotted against estimates of those
durations, the difference between the experimental condition
and control manifests itself as a difference in slope. This is
consistent with a multiplicative increase in pacemaker
speed, rather than a simple bias (which manifests as a
difference in intercept). Such slope effects have been found
for certain drugs (Meck, 1984), body temperature changes
(for review see Wearden & Penton-Voak, 1995), repetitive
stimulation (Penton-Voak, Edwards, Percival & Wearden,
1996), and filled versus unfilled durations (Wearden,
Norton, Martin & Montford-Bebb, 2007).
It is known that durations of sounds are judged longer
than lights (Goldstone et al., 1959). This effect manifests as
a difference in slope (Wearden et al., 1998), where the
auditory slope is steeper than the visual slope. It has been
argued that the pacemaker runs at a faster speed for auditory
than visual stimuli (Wearden et al., 1998; Penney, Gibbon &
Meck, 2000). This has sparked a debate about whether there
is a central pacemaker that runs at different speeds for
different modalities, or separate pacemakers for each
modality (See Grondin, 2010). These auditory-visual
differences have been found to occur on a range of timing
tasks, from temporal generalization (Wearden et al., 1998),
to temporal bisection (Penney et al., 2000), to temporal
difference thresholds (Jones et al., 2009), suggesting the
effect is not task-dependent.
Recently, the temporal judgement of tactile stimuli has
been investigated. Jones et al. (2009) found that verbal
estimation slopes and temporal difference thresholds for
tactile stimuli fall between those for auditory and visual
stimuli. Additionally, the two tasks share an inverted
pattern, where estimation slopes are highest (most accurate)
and thresholds are lowest (most sensitive) for auditory
stimuli, for example. It has been suggested that a faster
pacemaker is a more accurate pacemaker (Troche &
Rammsayer, 2011), which appears to be the case, but this
assertion has yet to be empirically investigated. Therefore,
the present series of studies will begin with a replication of
Jones et al. (2009), but analysis will also examine whether
estimation slopes and difference thresholds correlate with
each other for auditory, visual, and tactile stimuli.
In contrast to the pacemaker speed explanation, it has
been suggested that modality differences could be due to

intrinsic differences between the different sensory systems
(Yuasa & Yotsumoto, 2015), e.g. some combination of
differences in transduction rates (Zampini, Shore & Spence,
2003) and attentional biases (Spence, Shore & Klein, 2001).
Therefore, we will investigate whether these aspects of
sensory bias or salience correlate with differences between
auditory, visual and tactile stimuli. The present study will
operationalise sensory bias as the ‘point of subjective
simultaneity’ on a temporal order judgement task, i.e. the
duration that one modality has to precede another by, in
order for the two modalities to be judged as simultaneous.
In summary, the aim of the current work is to investigate
whether verbal estimates and temporal difference thresholds
correlate within each modality, and whether modality
differences can be alternatively explained by a measure of
sensory bias.

(auditory, visual, and tactile) five times. Trials were grouped
into three counterbalanced blocks by modality.
Each trial began with the presentation of a fixation cross
for 500-1000 ms, which was followed by the stimulus.
Participants were prompted on-screen to type in their
estimate in milliseconds and were reminded that 1 second =
1000 ms. The task lasted approximately 17 minutes.

Results

Experiment 1a: Verbal Estimation
Method
Participants 52 right-handed participants (staff and
students of the University of Manchester and some members
of the general population) completed all three tasks in a
counterbalanced order and received £10 for their time.
Apparatus and Materials Participants were seated at a
table in a dark room, with their chin on a chin rest. A PC
presented the experiments, written in E-Prime (Psychology
Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). A 17” Samsung
Syncmaster monitor stood at a distance of 60 cm.
Participants’ eyes were level with the top of the monitor and
the fixation cue and questions were displayed 20° below eye
level. A black foam grip (5.5 x 9.5 x 4.5 cm) was secured to
the table 30cm in front of participants in the centreline.
Behind the grip was a Sony speaker, which presented the
auditory stimuli (500 Hz sine wave tones), and to the left of
the grip was a numerical keypad (8.5 x 12 cm) for use with
the left hand.
The grip housed an Oticon-A (100 Ohm) bone conductor
with vibrating surface 1.6 cm x 2.4 cm. The bone conductor
was inset into the foam in the index finger position when
gripped with the right hand, and driven by a 500 Hz sine
wave signal through a TactAmp 4.2 amplifier (Dancer
Design). Visual stimuli were presented via a 6 mm green
LED light (87 cd/m2), embedded in a black plastic casing (4
x 4 x 1.75 cm) and attached on top of the foam block. The
LED was 16° below the fixation cue (36° below eye level)
and 32 cm in front of participants.
Participants wore 3M Peltor ear protectors with inset
earphones, which played white noise (56 dB) during the
tasks to mask the sound of the vibrations.
Procedure On each trial participants estimated the duration
of a stimulus. The task contained 150 trials, where ten
stimulus durations (77, 203, 348, 461, 582, 767, 834, 958,
1065, and 1183 ms) were presented in each modality

Mean Verbal Estimate (ms)

Outliers were defined as estimation functions that were
invariant to stimulus duration (identified as linear
regressions not significantly different to 0), which suggested
an inability to perform the task. This led to the exclusion of
one individual, leaving a sample of 51 participants. See
Figure 1 for the mean verbal estimates for each modality.
The hypothesis that verbal estimates would be highest for
auditory stimuli and lowest for visual stimuli was examined
using a factorial ANOVA with two repeated measures
factors: modality (auditory, visual and tactile) and stimulus
duration.

The ANOVA found a main effect of stimulus duration,
F(2.60, 130.17) = 750.70, p < .001, ƞp2 = .938. Post hoc analyses
revealed that each of the 10 stimulus durations were
estimated as significantly differently from each other (p
< .001 for all comparisons).
There was also a main effect of modality, F(2, 100) = 7.50, p
= .001, ƞp2 = .131. Post hoc analyses revealed that
participants estimated auditory stimuli to be significantly
longer than visual (p = .006) and tactile (p = .012) stimuli.
However, estimates for visual and tactile stimuli did not
significantly differ (p = .909).
The interaction between stimulus duration and modality
was also significant, F(8.39, 419.32) = 4.914, p < .001, ƞp2
= .089. In order to investigate this interaction, linear
regressions were conducted to extract the slope and
intercept values of each participant’s verbal estimation
function for each modality. See Figure 2 for mean slope
values.

A repeated measures one-way ANOVA comparing the
slopes across modalities found a significant difference
between them, F(2, 100) = 12.76, p < .001, ƞp2 = .203. Post hoc
analyses confirmed that auditory slopes were significantly
higher than visual slopes (p < .001), but not significantly
different to tactile slopes (p = 1.00). In addition, the tactile
slopes were significantly higher than visual slopes (p =
.001).

Discussion
Verbal estimation slopes for auditory stimuli were
significantly and multiplicatively higher than those for
visual stimuli, with tactile slopes falling between the two.
As perfect estimates would have a slope of 1, this suggests
that people are more accurate when estimating durations of
sounds and vibrations than lights, but tend to underestimate
all three modalities. This is the same pattern of results found
as in Jones et al. (2009).
Auditory and tactile estimates differed significantly in the
first ANOVA, but further analysis on slopes (as pacemaker
speed differences are said to manifest as slope effects) found
the slopes not to differ. The significant difference between
the two in the first ANOVA was perhaps due to a difference
in intercept.

Procedure Participants completed a 50-trial threshold task
in each of the three modalities in a counterbalanced order.
The test stimuli were the same as in Experiment 1a.
Each trial began with the presentation of a fixation cross
for 500-1000 ms, which was followed by the stimuli. The
first stimulus (the standard) was always 700 ms, while the
second stimulus (the comparator) began at 1000 ms in
duration. A 500-1000 ms delay occurred between the two
stimuli, and a 125-250 ms delay followed the second
stimulus. The order of the standard and the comparator was
counterbalanced between trials. Participants pressed ‘1’ or
‘2’ on the keypad depending on whether they thought the
first or the second stimulus was longer.
This task used a weighted 3-up 1-down staircase method
(Kaernbach, 1991), which allowed for the calculation of the
difference in stimulus durations that participants can
discriminate 75% of the time. The step size was 15 ms for
the first 30 trials, then 10 ms for the last 20 trials.
Thresholds were calculated as the mean difference between
the standard and comparator durations across the last 20
trials. The task took approximately 18 minutes to complete.

Results
Outliers were defined as thresholds greater than 600 ms
(twice the starting difference) which suggested an inability
to perform the task. However, no participant had thresholds
above this value, giving a full sample of 52 participants.
Figure 3 shows the mean difference between the standard
and comparator durations across the 50 trials for the three
modalities. The resulting temporal difference thresholds can
be seen in Figure 4.

stimuli (Wearden et al., 1998; Jones et al., 2009) and that a
faster pacemaker leads to greater accuracy and sensitivity
(Troche & Rammsayer, 2011). However, accuracy in
estimates (slopes) and sensitivity to duration (thresholds)
did not correlate for within any modality. This poses a
problem for applying the pacemaker explanation to both of
these tasks. It could be argued that estimates (magnitude
judgements) and thresholds (discrimination judgements)
rely on different mechanisms and are of different levels of
abstraction, but we expected small correlations despite the
transformative nature of estimations.

Discussion
Thresholds for visual stimuli were significantly higher than
both auditory and tactile stimuli, while auditory and tactile
thresholds did not significantly differ. This suggests that
people have greater sensitivity to the durations of sounds
and vibrations than lights. This pattern of thresholds was
reported previously by Jones et al. (2009).

Research Question 1: Do Estimates and
Thresholds Correlate within Each Modality?

This experiment will calculate sensory bias, as measured by
the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) on a temporal
order judgement task. The PSS measures the duration that
one modality has to precede another by, in order for the two
modalities to be judged as simultaneous. This can be seen as
a measure of relative salience between the different senses
and is affected by the intrinsic properties of each sensory
system, e.g. transduction rates (Zampini et al., 2003) and
attentional biases (Spence et al., 2001).
Previous research has found sensory biases (measured by
PSS) in favour of auditory stimuli when compared with
visual (Zampini et al., 2003) and tactile stimuli (Zampini,
Shore & Spence, 2005) and in favour of tactile stimuli when
compared with visual stimuli (Spence et al., 2001).
Therefore, PSSs appear to follow the same modality pattern
as estimates and thresholds.
This measure of sensory bias will be investigated as an
alternative explanation for the differences between auditory,
visual and tactile performance on estimation and threshold
tasks in the next section.

Methods

Results
The same outlier criteria were applied as in the previous
sections, with the addition of values 2.5 SDs from the mean.
Following removal, this left 51, 49 and 51 participants for
auditory, visual and tactile correlations respectively.
Three Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients
found no correlations between estimation slopes and
thresholds within each modality (See Table 1).

Apparatus and Materials The same apparatus and
materials were used as in Experiment 1a and 1b.
Procedure Participants were presented with two crossmodal stimuli (15 ms each) in quick succession and were
asked which occurred first. The task contained 300 trials,
where participants were presented with three modality pairs
(Aud-Vis, Aud-Tac, Vis-Tac), at 10 different stimulus onset
asynchronies (SOAs, -400, -200, -90, -55, -20, +20, +55,
+90, +200, and +400 ms), each repeated 10 times. Negative
SOAs mean that the first-named stimulus in the pairing
came first (e.g. auditory in the Aud-Vis stimulus pair),
whereas positive SOAs indicate that the second-named
modality came first. Trials were separated into three
counterbalanced blocks by modality pair.
On each trial a fixation cross appeared on the screen after
a 500 ms delay, where it remained for the rest of the trial.
The first stimulus was presented following a random

3537

duration between 500-1000 ms. After the randomly selected
SOA, the second stimulus was presented. For example, if
the Aud-Vis modality pair was presented with the -400 ms
SOA, participants heard a 15 ms tone, followed by a delay
of 385 ms, and then saw the green LED illuminate for 15
ms. After a 125-250 ms delay, participants were then
prompted to answer “Which stimulus came first?” and
participants pressed ‘1’ or ‘2’ on the keypad. The task took
approximately 15 minutes to complete.

Results
Cumulative Gaussian psychometric functions were fitted to
participants’ individual data, coded according to ‘proportion
auditory-first’, for example. The PSS and just noticeable
difference (JND) were extracted for each individual for each
modality pair.
Participants’ PSSs were inspected for outliers, identified
as those with related JNDs greater than 400 ms (Zampini et
al., 2003), which suggested an inability to complete the task.
This resulted in the exclusion of eight individuals, leaving a
sample of 44 participants. See Figure 5 for PSSs for each
cross-modal comparison.

Discussion
Significant sensory biases were found in favour of auditory
stimuli when compared with tactile stimuli, and in favour of
tactile stimuli when compared with visual stimuli, which
concurs with previous research (Spence et al., 2001;
Zampini et al., 2005). However, no significant sensory
biases were found between auditory and visual stimuli. This
was unexpected and is contrary to both previous research
(Zampini et al., 2003), and our hypothesis that the large
differences between auditory and visual estimates and
thresholds may be due to large sensory biases.
Nevertheless, the next section will investigate whether
these sensory biases correlate with the differences between
modalities in estimates and thresholds.

Research Question 2: Do cross-modal PSSs
correlate with the differences between
modalities in estimates and thresholds?
Results
The same outlier criteria were applied as in the previous
sections, leaving a sample 44 participants.
Six Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients
found no correlations between PSSs and estimation slopes
or thresholds for any cross-modal pair (See Table 2).

Point of Subjective Simultaneity (ms)

Discussion
Figure 5: Mean Point of Subjective Simultaneity for
auditory-visual, visual-tactile and tactile-auditory
comparisons. Error bars denote standard error.
No significant sensory bias was found between auditory
and visual stimuli, indicated by the PSS not departing from
zero (t(43) = .94, p = .354). However, the PSS for visualtactile comparisons was significantly above zero, t(43) =
3.24, p = .002. Participants were biased in favour of tactile
stimuli in this comparison, and required visual stimuli to be
presented 37 ms before tactile stimuli, for the pair to be
judged as simultaneous. In addition, the PSS for auditorytactile comparisons was also significantly above zero (t(43) =
3.21, p = .003). Participants were biased in favour of
auditory stimuli in this comparison, and required tactile
stimuli to be presented 22 ms before auditory stimuli for
subjective simultaneity.

Cross-modal sensory biases, as measured by PSSs, were
found not to correlate with the differences in estimates and
thresholds between each modality pair. This suggests that
the differences in auditory, visual and tactile estimates and
thresholds cannot be explained by the intrinsic sensory
biases of the three different systems.

General Discussion
We aimed to investigate the pacemaker explanation for
differences between auditory, visual and tactile estimates
and thresholds, and discovered three main findings. Firstly,
the pattern of differences between the modalities appears to
be robust as we replicated these in Experiments 1a and 1b
(with minor differences in magnitude). Secondly, estimates
and thresholds do not correlate within each modality. This
poses a problem for the idea that both the slopes in verbal

3538

estimation and the order of thresholds are mostly
determined by pacemaker rate. Finally, the modality
differences in estimates and thresholds did not correlate
with sensory biases, potentially ruling out this alternative
explanation. These findings generate several possible
conclusions:
1. Pacemaker rate does not determine estimation slopes or
threshold values
2. Pacemaker rate determines estimation slopes but not
threshold values (or vice-versa)
3. Pacemaker rate contributes to both slopes and
thresholds, but this contribution is washed out by other
cognitive processes
Despite these theoretical uncertainties, the present research
can state that the assertion that faster pacemakers give rise
to smaller thresholds (Troche & Rammsayer, 2011) is
flawed, if one assumes that the pacemaker underlies both
estimation and threshold tasks.
At present, there is no published model of how the scalar
timing theory system operates in threshold tasks, unlike
for temporal generalization (Droit-Volet, Clément &
Wearden, 2001), temporal bisection (Wearden, 1991) and
verbal estimation (Wearden, 2015). Additionally, the
mathematical consequences of increasing pacemaker speed
on timing performance (and the assumptions this is based
on) in tasks are not explored or predicted in any great detail
in the literature. Therefore, our future work will examine the
role of the pacemaker in a model of threshold behavior and
model mathematical implications of altering pacemaker rate.
Overall, the simple pacemaker speed explanation appears
to fail and a more nuanced explanation is required.
