methods to improve students’ mathematical skills.
These methods not only include traditional school
interventions (for a review, see Hattie, 2009), but also
cognitive-training based treatments. Examples of such
treatments to foster students’ attainment in mathematics and
other academic and cognitive skills include working memory
training (Sala & Gobet, 2017a), chess instruction (Gobet &
Campitelli, 2006; Sala, Foley, & Gobet, 2017; Sala & Gobet,
in press-a; Sala & Gobet, 2016; Sala, Gobet, Trinchero, &
Ventura, 2016; Sala, Gorini, & Pravettoni, 2015; Trinchero
& Sala, 2016), and music training (Sala & Gobet, 2017b).
The results show either minimal overall effects on academic
achievement and overall cognitive ability (music and
working memory training) or medium effects possibly due to
placebo effects (chess). These results are in line with
Thorndike and Woodworth’s (1901) common element theory
according to which far transfer – i.e., the generalization of a
set of skills across domains only loosely related – rarely
occurs (Gobet, 2016; Sala & Gobet, 2017c; Sala & Gobet, in
press-b).

Introduction

Spatial Training

Concerns have been raised about young people’s low
achievements in mathematics, both in Europe (Greg, 2009)
and the United States (Hanushek, Peterson, & Woessmann,
2012; Richland, Stigler, & Holyoak, 2012). Students’
insufficient mathematical ability has serious implications, as
the likelihood of graduating in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects is limited by
one’s mathematical ability. The job market increasingly
demands workforce with STEM expertise and requires
increasingly higher competencies, making competition
fiercer worldwide (Halpern et al., 2007).
Students’ attainment in mathematics is thus a matter of
crucial practical importance. For this reason, an impressive
amount of research has been devoted to pinpointing the
cognitive correlates of mathematical ability (e.g., Deary,
Strand, Smith, & Fernandes, 2007; Lubinski, 2010; Peng,
Namkung, Barnes, & Sun, 2016; Rohde & Thompson, 2007;

Another, relatively understudied, type of intervention to
enhance mathematical ability is spatial training. Spatial
training includes activities such as 2D and 3D mental
rotation, spatial reasoning and visualizations (Sorby, 2011).
However, given the difficulty of far transfer to take place,
why should spatial training increase mathematical ability?

Abstract
The positive relationship between spatial ability and
mathematical skills is a classical result in developmental and
cognitive psychology. Given this correlational relationship,
researchers have tried to establish whether spatial training can
increase mathematical ability. Such research has provided
mixed results. In this study, we analysed the effects of two
types of spatial training and handedness on primary school
children’s arithmetical ability. The participants were pre-tested
on a test of arithmetic and assigned to one of three groups: (a)
one hour of mental rotation and translation training, (b) one
hour of mental translation training only, or (c) a no-contact
group. The results showed no significant difference between
training groups and a significant interaction between training
group and category of handedness. Interestingly, only
extremely right-handed children in the mental rotation and
translation group seemed to benefit from the training. These
outcomes suggest that any spatial training needs to include
mental rotation activities to be effective, and that the
relationship between spatial training and achievement
mathematics appears to be moderated by handedness.

The Relationship between Spatial and
Mathematical Abilities
Problem solving in mathematics and STEM disciplines
largely relies on spatial ability (Stieff & Uttal, 2015).
Mechanical physics and engineering deal with movement and
interaction between elements in a geometrical space.
Mathematicians work with functions represented in 2D and
3D space. More generally, several branches of mathematics
– necessary to master disciplines such as physics and
engineering – require the manipulation of spatial
relationships (e.g. geometry, calculus, topology).

The tight relation between spatial ability and mathematical
ability has been established empirically. These two separate
constructs are highly correlated to each other (Mix et al.,
2016). Spatial abilities – such as mental rotation ability (Mix
et al., 2016; Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2009) – are thus
strong predictors of achievement in mathematics, both in
children (Lauer & Lourenco, 2016) and in undergraduate and
doctorate students (Wai et al., 2009). Thus, several
researchers have suggested that training spatial ability causes
improvement in mathematics achievement.

Spatial Training to Train Spatial and STEM
Abilities: The Empirical Evidence
Before asking whether spatial training leads to improving
mathematical skills such as arithmetic or geometry, one has
to verify whether spatial ability can be trained. A metaanalysis carried out by Uttal et al. (2013) suggests that this is
the case. Spatial training appears to transfer both to the
trained tasks and other spatial tasks not directly trained.1
Crucially, from a practical point of view, spatial ability seems
to be malleable enough to be significantly boosted by a shortterm training (Uttal et al., 2013).
The evidence supporting the effectiveness of spatial
training at improving performance on spatial tasks appears to
be quite solid. Regrettably, it is not possible to reach the same
conclusion for non-spatial tasks. The research on spatial
training to improve STEM achievement has provided
promising results, but the number of studies is still relatively
limited.
In His, Linn, and Bell (1997), a group of undergraduates
improved their attainment in an engineering course after
attending a voluntary spatial training (3D orthographic
projections). However, the fact that the sample was selfselected casts serious doubts upon the reliability of the
outcome. More recently, Sorby (2009) reported that a group
of undergraduates in engineering with low spatial ability
improved their course grades after spatial training (Sorby,
2011), whereas a control group with no training did not show
any amelioration. These positive findings were replicated two
years later (Sorby, Casey, Veurink, & Dulaney, 2013). Less
clear were the results in Miller and Halpern’s (2013) study.
They did find a moderate positive effect after delivering
spatial training, but only in items related to Newtonian
mechanics. No benefits occurred in other courses.
The studies mentioned above dealt with university
students. Cheng and Mix (2014) focused on the effects of
short-term (40 minutes) spatial training on children’s basic
arithmetical ability. The training consisted of 40 minutes of
mental rotation and mental translation exercises suitable for
children (Ehrlich, Levine, & Goldin-Meadow, 2006). The
treatment group showed a small improvement
(approximatively d = 0.20) in the test of arithmetic, limited
1 It must be noticed that transfer of training to multivariate
measures of a particular skill (e.g., spatial ability) does not
necessarily mean that that skill has been successfully enhanced
(Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, 2012). In fact, the improvement in a

to one particular type of items (missing-term problems). A
study by Hawes, Moss, Caswell, and Poliszczuk (2015)
found no significant effects of mental rotation training on a
group of primary school children’s arithmetical ability.
Finally, Xu and LeFevre (2016) reported no transfer from
spatial training to a number line task in a sample of
kindergarten children.

The Potential Moderating Role of Handedness
Several researchers have argued that the relation between
mathematical and spatial ability may be moderated by
handedness (Casey, Pezaris, & Nuttall, 1992). Handedness is
believed to affect achievement in mathematics because it
represents the degree of dominance and development of the
right hemisphere, which is involved in cognitive tasks such
as spatial reasoning (Ganley & Vasilyeva, 2011) and mental
rotation ability (O’Boyle et al., 2005). Some non-righthanders (i.e., left-handed and ambidextrous people) have a
more developed right hemisphere than right-handers
(Gutwinski et al., 2011). Such a condition may explain why
non-right-handers excel in domains where spatial ability is
required. For example, non-right-handers are present among
chess players in significantly greater ratio than the general
population (Gobet & Campitelli, 2007). The same pattern has
been found in artists (Preti & Vellante, 2007).
Whether non-right-handers are better than right-handers in
mathematics is still a matter of debate (e.g., Benbow, 1986;
Cheyne, Roberts, Crow, Leask, & García-Fiñana, 2010;
McManus, 2002). However, it appears that among righthanders, those who show a consistent preference for using the
right hand (hereafter, extreme right-handers) underperform in
mathematics (e.g., Annett & Manning, 1989; Cheyne et al.,
2010; Peters, 1991). The possible explanation relies again on
the degree of development of the right hemisphere in
comparison to the left hemisphere. According to Annett
(2002), a strong dominance of the left hemisphere may lead
to both being extremely right-handed and suffering from
some deficits in spatial ability and, hence, in mathematics. In
line with this idea, in a recent large study (total N = 2,314),
extreme right-handers obtained a poorer score on a variety of
tests of mathematics compared to moderate right-handers
(Sala, Signorelli, Barsuola, Bolognese, & Gobet, submitted).

The Present Study
In this study, we replicated and extended Cheng and Mix’s
(2014) study. There were two crucial additions. First, we
tested whether the effects of training (if any) on mathematical
ability interact with handedness. We expected extreme righthanders to perform more poorly on the pre-test of arithmetic
than the moderate right-handers and non-right-handers. Most
importantly, given that the extreme right-handers are
believed to have a lower mathematical ability because of a
variety of tasks may stem from some general ability at performing
spatial tasks (e.g., better strategies). In any case, this important
theoretical issue is beyond the aims of this article.

spatial deficit, we also expected them to benefit most from
the spatial training task. Second, along with the treatment and
no-contact groups, another treatment group practicing only
mental translation was included. The rationale was to
understand whether mental translation training alone (i.e., no
mental rotation) could positively influence attainment in
mathematics (see below for details).

rotation items and 16 translation items. Analogously
to the testing session, the participants were asked to
choose one of the pictures. Finally, children were
given the two parts of the picture on separate pieces
of cardstock and requested to confirm or change the
choice after putting them together (Figure 2).
b) Three classes (one first-, one second-, one thirdgrade) attended 60 minutes of 32 translation
exercises only (translation group; Figure 3). The
training procedure was analogous to that in the
previous group.
c) Three classes (one first-, one second-, one thirdgrade) did not carry any activity (no-contact group).

Method
Participants
A total of 159 first, second, and third graders in nine classes
of a primary school in northern Italy took part in this
experiment. The mean age of the participants was 7.61 years
(SD = 0.89). Parental consent was asked and obtained for all
the participants.

Materials
The participants were administered (a) the Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory (EHI),2 (b) a spatial ability task
(mental rotation and translation) suitable for children (score
range 0 – 16; Ehrlich et al., 2006), and (c) a test of arithmetic,
designed by the experimenters (score range 0 – 27; Cronbach
Alpha = .96).
EHI is a multiple-item questionnaire that provides a
continuous measure of handedness (h), which is calculated
using the formula
, where R and L indicate the
number of preferences for the right and left hand,
respectively. The range of values is between -1, for extreme
left-handedness, and +1, for extreme right-handedness. The
participants were categorized according to their h-values
(Casey, 1995):

Figure 1. Two examples of the items used in the spatial test
(translation and rotation).

a) Extreme right-handers: h ≥ .90 (N = 48).
b) Moderate right-handers: .40 < h < .90 (N = 81).
c) Non-right-handers: h ≤ .40 (N = 30).
The test of mental rotation and translation ability consists
of 16 items. The participant is shown four whole pictures and
two parts of a flat shape. The participant has to mentally put
the two pieces together and choose one of the four whole
pictures (Figure 1).
In the test of arithmetic, finally, the participants solved
simple mathematical equations (e.g., 3 + 4 = ?) and missingterm problems (e.g., 3 + ? = 7).

Design
All the nine classes were pre-tested in arithmetic, spatial
ability (rotation/translation), and EHI. A week later, the nine
classes were randomly assigned to three groups:
a) Three classes (one first-, one second-, one thirdgrade) attended 60 minutes of mental rotation and
translation exercises. This training consisted of 16

handedness (h-cat; p = .846), or group (p = .491). As
expected, a significant effect of the pre-test scores was found
(p < .001). Interestingly, a significant interaction between
group and category of handedness was reported (p = .013).

The extreme right-handers in the full-training group
showed the greatest mean improvement in the test of
arithmetic compared to the other extreme right-handers. The
pre- and post-test mean scores are summarized in Table 3.

Results
The three groups did not differ in terms of age (p = .970) or
pre-test arithmetic test scores (p = .391). As expected, the
category of handedness had a significant effect on the pre-test
scores in arithmetic (F(2, 156) = 6.50, p = .002). Extreme
right-handers were outperformed by both moderate righthanders (p < .001) and non-right-handers (p = .048).
The pre-post test correlations for arithmetical ability and
spatial ability were r = .94 and r = .60, respectively (both ps
< .001).
Finally, an ANCOVA (pre-test scores as the covariate)
confirmed that the spatial training had a significant effect on
the score of spatial ability. In fact, the two training groups
(full and translation) outperformed the no-contact group (p =
.030 and p = .004, respectively).

Discussion
The results of this experiment show no significant impact of
the one-hour spatial training on children’s arithmetical
ability. In fact, most of the variance in the post-test of
arithmetical ability is explained by pre-test scores (r = .94; r2
 100 = 88%). This outcome is in accordance with previous
experimental studies (e.g., Cheng & Mix, 2014; Hawes et al.,
2015; Xu & LeFevre, 2016) examining the effects of spatial
training on arithmetical ability. In a wider perspective, our
results are consistent with substantial research on far transfer
(Burgoyne et al., 2016; Sala et al., 2017; Sala & Gobet, 2016,
2017a, 2017b).
However, the significant role played by handedness,
predicted by Annett (2002), sheds light on the potential
benefits of spatial training on arithmetical ability. The
extreme right-handers in the full-training group reported the
best improvement in mathematical ability compared to both
the whole groups and the sub-samples of extreme righthanders. This pattern of results suggests that short-term
mental spatial training may be effective for a particular
subsample of underachievers in arithmetic (i.e., extreme
right-handers), as long as mental rotation activities are
included.

Recommendations for Future Research
This study highlights the possible benefits of mental rotation
training for extreme right-handers’ arithmetical ability. In
order to confirm (or disconfirm) our results, future
investigations should replicate and extend the design of the

3042

current study. First, even if the total sample was large (N =
159), the subgroup of extreme right-handers consisted of only
a few tens of individuals (N = 48) distributed across three
groups. Given the importance of that subgroup for the main
hypothesis of this study, future experiments should include
more participants (e.g., as twice as many) to increase the
statistical power, and hence the reliability, of the analysis and
outcomes. Second, the future investigations should
systematically manipulate the duration of training and
administer both immediate and delayed post-test
assessments. This way, it would be possible to evaluate
whether the effects of spatial training on extreme righthanders’ on mathematical ability increase with the duration
of training and last after its end. Third, we collected only one
measure of mathematical ability (i.e., arithmetic). The use of
multivariate measures of mathematical ability and spatial
ability would contribute to establishing whether spatial
training benefits for extreme right-handers goes beyond basic
arithmetic ability.
