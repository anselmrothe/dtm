Abstract

The recent invention of the “silent discos” separates these
factors and raises an interesting question. At these events,
each person wears a set of wireless headphones that can be
connected to different DJs playing different pieces of music.
So two people next to each other may be engaging in similar,
synchronised bodily movements, or not. Each person may or
may not know if the person next to them is listening to the
same music. What conditions will produce affiliation
between the dancers: the similarity between their movements,
or the knowledge that they are dancing together to the same
music? We created an experimental version of this situation
to find out. Rather than manipulating shared music, however,
we manipulated shared social context.
This question does not just relate to our specific
understanding of silent discos, of course, but raises much
broader questions about the function of bodily mimicry for
the affective states of social relationships. The dominant
prediction from the psychological literature is that movement
similarity causes affiliation. One proposed mechanism is that
action observation activates a representation of a similar
motor plan in the observer (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999). This
mirroring has been linked to a particular set of visuo-motor
neurones in the brain known as the ‘mirror system’ (Di
Pellegrino, Fadiga, Fogassi, Gallese, & Rizzolatti, 1992;
Mukamel, Ekstrom, Kaplan, Iacoboni, & Fried, 2010), which
are claimed to contribute to social cognition and affiliation
(Gallese & Goldman, 1998; Pineda, 2009). Supported by
many experimental findings, these theories predict that what
is required to increase affiliation between two silent disco
dancers is a match between their bodily movements.
However, there are two reasons to hypothesize that social
context may play an important part in the relationship
between affiliation and mimicry. Firstly, imitation can be
modulated by social factors such as eye contact (Wang,
Newport, & Hamilton, 2010), group membership (Yabar,
Johnston, Miles, & Peace, 2006), or the circumstances under
which people meet (Miles, Griffiths, Richardson M., &
Macrae, 2010). Secondly, one lab experiment has shown that
affiliation can be increased by action contingency alone.
Catmur and Heyes (2013) asked participants to perform
either a hand or a foot movement at random. In response, they
either saw the same action that they had just performed
onscreen, or the opposite one. The actions onscreen either
occurred contingently, every time participants acted, or noncontingently, sometimes appearing and sometimes not.

When people move together, as they dance, march or flirt, it
increases affiliation between them. But what about ‘moving
together’ produces affiliation: the movements themselves, or
the social context of moving ‘together’? We instructed pairs of
participants to listen to music and move their arms or legs
according to shapes appearing on screen. They either carried
out the same movements, or when one moved their arms the
other moved their legs. They either saw shapes on one laptop,
or each had their own laptop. Surprisingly, participants did not
like each other more if they carried out the same movements,
but affiliation did increase if they danced looking at the same
screen. Rather than their movements, instructions, intentions
or perceptual experiences, here it is the social context of the
actions that produces affiliation, a surprising finding that is not
easily accounted for by the dominant theories of mimicry and
behavioural synchrony.

Introduction
People have danced, marched and moved together across
cultures and history (McNeill, 1995). One reason, suggested
by the literature, is that mimicry and synchronous movement
acts as a form of ‘social glue’, increasing liking when two
people mimic each other’s gestures (Chartrand & van Baaren,
2009), walk in step with each other (Wiltermuth, 2012), tap
in synchrony (Hove & Risen, 2009), or move together to a
common beat (Reddish, Fischer, & Bulbulia, 2013).
Dance as one particularly social form of human
coordination (Dunbar, 2012; Tarr, Launay, Cohen, &
Dunbar, 2015), usually takes place in a shared social context:
people in the same room, co-present with others, are listening
to the same music. Similarly, demonstrations of motor
mimicry increasing affiliation also take place in the shared
social context of an experiment. What is the contribution of
these two factors, a shared social context and similarity in
movement, in changing affiliation when people dance
together? From research to date this is not clear, as the two
factors are confounded in dance as it typically occurs in
society, and mimicry as it is typically studied in the
laboratory. Which provide the psychological conditions for
dancing ‘together’?

Different

Figure 1. (a) In the joint condition, participants’ headphones were plugged into a splitter and they shared a screen. In the
parallel condition, participants had two separate screens and their headphones were plugged in separately. In response to a
shape appearing on screen, participants either moved the same limb at the same time as each other, or when one moved a
hand the other moved a foot (or vice versa). (b) Laboratory layout in the parallel context condition. In the joint condition the
screen was placed in the middle.
Participants’ pro-social feelings were influenced by the
contingency of their actions, but not by the match between
the actions they made and the actions they saw.
This leads to the prediction that for our two dancers at a
silent disco, what will increase affiliation is the social context
that leads them to interpret their actions as linked and
contingent upon each other – that they are dancing ‘together’.
In contrast, the prediction from the behavioural coordination
literature is that affiliation will be higher when the
participants’ movements are the same.
To test these predictions, we instructed pairs of participants
to listen to music on headphones and to perform the same or
different movements in one of two conditions: in the joint
social context, participants danced ‘together’ looking at a
single computer screen that guided their movements. In the
parallel social context, they each had their own screens, side
by side, showing the same movement instructions.
Afterwards, we measured participants’ levels of affiliation to
tease apart the contribution of social context and movement
similarity in producing liking.

Participants
We estimated an effect size of d = 0.7, following Lumsden,
Miles and Macrae (2014) for affiliation effects arising from
mimicry, and an a priori power analysis using G*Power
(version 3.1.9.2; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007)
suggested a sample size of 76 to achieve 85% power (with α
= 0.05). To be conservative, Experiment 1 tested 80
participants (58 females; mean age = 24.66 years; SD = 6.84
years, 29 non-UK nationals) and Experiment 2 tested 82
participants (62 females; mean age = 21.8, SD = 6.1, 45 nonUK nationals), recruited from the UCL Psychology Subject
Pool. No participants were excluded. Participants in both
studies were compensated through course credit or a
monetary reward of £4. It was ensured that the members of
each dyad did not know each other prior to the experiment.

Ethics Statement
Ethical approval was obtained from the UCL Research Ethics
Committee. All participants provided written informed
consent before the beginning of the study and were fully
debriefed upon completion.

Methods
We performed two experiments manipulating movement
similarity and social context between pairs of participants. In
the first experiment, as well as using a single screen, the joint
social context was additionally established by giving
participants the task of first untangling their headphone
cables before plugging into their shared display. In our
second experiment, we aimed to replicate our methods, but
with the untangling task removed, so that the joint social
context was established by the shared display alone. Since the
experiments and analyses are identical in every other regard,
we describe them together here.

Procedure
Experiments had a 2 x 2 (social context: joint or parallel;
movements: same or different) between-subjects design with
pairs randomly assigned to conditions (Figure 1). In
Experiment 1, participants in the joint condition were first
given the task of untangling headphone cables together then
plug them in. In the parallel condition, the headphones were
already plugged into separate laptops. In Experiment 2, the
untangling task was not included in either condition.

545

Participants wore headphones and stood 1m apart from
each other, 2.5m away from a table, in a square marked on
the floor (Figure 1). In the parallel social context, there were
two screens (diameter: 27cm, diagonal: 33.78cm) 1m apart
on the table that showed identical stimuli throughout the
experiment. In the joint social context, there was one screen
midway between participants.
In the same movement condition, both participants were
given same shape-movement instructions (e.g., circle = leg
movement and triangle = hand movement). In the different
movement condition, one participant had the mapping
reversed. Shapes were presented randomly on the left, right
or middle of the display, indicating the direction that
participants were to move their limbs. After a practice stage,
participants danced for 4:50 min to shapes appearing every
1.2 seconds, matching the tempo of the song ‘I turn my

camera on’ by Spoon. Participants were then led into
different rooms. We measured affiliation in two ways. First,
participants responded to a 15 item subset of the Subject
Impressions Questionnaire (SIQ) from the Intrinsic
Motivation Inventory (Ryan, Koestner, & Deci, 1991).
Second, we measured affiliation with the Inclusion of Other
in Self (IOS) scale (Aron, Aron, & Smollan, 1992), in which
participants chose between 7 pairs of differently overlapping
circles to represent their relationship with the other
participant. Finally, as a manipulation check, we asked how
much the participants attended to each other, and if they felt
like they were dancing ‘together’. The experiment lasted for
approximately 30 minutes. All measures and manipulations
have been reported here, and analysis did not begin in each
experiment until we had collected our target of 80
participants in each.

Results

(Bayes factor 0.68:1). There was weak evidence that joint
social context resulted in participants paying more attention
to each other (Bayes factor 3:1), but evidence in favour of the
null hypothesis and against an effect of movement condition
on attention (Bayes factor 6:1).
Why was there no effect of movement similarity? One
possibility, the ‘attention only’ account, is that participants’
movements did not influence their affiliation because they
simply didn’t pay attention to each other, but if they had, then
movement similarity would have had an effect. Logically, on
this account, the more attention participants paid to each
other’s identical movements, the larger the increase in
affiliation would be. And the more they paid attention to each
other’s dissimilar movements, the larger the decrease in
affiliation would be. However, when we looked at the
attention participants paid to each other, there was no such
pattern of results. In fact, an increase in participants’ attention
to one another did not affect SIQ and increased it for both
similar and dissimilar movements for ISO.
In the case of IOS scores, attention was positively related
to affiliation in both the same movement (Bayes factor 70:1)
and, crucially, in the different movement condition as well
(Bayes factor 50:1). Moreover, the evidence was against a
model for ISO scores with attention, movement condition and
an interaction between them, over a model that just included
attention (Bayes factor 12:1). In the SIQ scores, there was no
evidence that attention to others was related to affiliation
(Bayes factor 0.35:1), and strong evidence against the
hypothesis that a model with SIQ scores, movement
condition and an interaction between them was preferred over
the null hypothesis (Bayes factor 50:1).
We ran correlational analyses between our measure of
‘attending to others’ and the two measures of affiliation
overall, and splitting the data according to social context and
movement, to see if those relationships changed between
conditions. We calculated Zou’s (2007) 95% confidence
intervals for differences between conditions. In each case, the
CI encompassed 0, suggesting that the correlations did not
differ between conditions, supporting the conclusions drawn
from Bayesian analysis.

Across two different measures we found strong evidence that
affiliation was increased by a joint social context, but was
unaffected by movement similarity. We employed a Bayesian
analysis of our results, since in addition to avoiding some of
the problems of null hypothesis significance testing
(Kruschke, 2010), these analyses are able to estimate the
relative strength of evidence for and against null and
alternative hypotheses (Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom,
& van der Maas, 2011). Analyses were conducted in R using
the BayesFactor package (Morey & Rouder, 2015) and
default parameter values. For our analyses, we used the
default Cauchy prior with a scale of √2 / 2, which is seen as
appropriate under a broad array of situations (see Rouder,
Speckman, Sun, Morey & Iverson, 2009), following the
emerging practice in this application of Bayesian techniques
(e.g. de Moliere & Harris, 2016), and compared against the
null hypothesis that the conditions had no effect.
Figure 2 presents the distribution of SIQ and IOS scores
across our manipulations and to the right of each plot,
Bayesian credibility intervals (Kruschke, 2010) for the
differences between conditions. These analyses suggest that
between the social context conditions there is difference
between mean SIQ and ISO scores, but no difference between
the movement similarity conditions. Since there was no
evidence in our analyses for an interaction between social
context and movement conditions, the main effects are
plotting in Figure 2.
To quantify the strength of these effects further we
calculated Bayes factors. On SIQ scores, a Bayesian Type II
ANOVA found very strong evidence in favour of a main
effect of social context (Bayes factor: 300:1) over the null
hypothesis, but evidence against a main effect of movement
similarity in favour of the null hypothesis (Bayes factor 6:1)
and against there being a difference between the two
experiments (Bayes factor 5:1). There was also evidence
against any interaction effects between conditions (Bayes
factors between 3 and 4:1). A similar pattern of likelihoods
was found for IOS scores. There was strong evidence in
favour of an effect of social context (Bayes factor 101:1),
evidence against an effect of movement condition (Bayes
factor 4:1), evidence against a difference between
experiments (Bayes factor 5:1), and against any interaction
effects (Bayes factors between 3 and 4:1).
The conclusions we reached from Bayesian analyses were
echoed by more orthodox null hypothesis testing. We ran a 2
(movement condition) x 2 (social context) x 2 (experiment)
ANOVA. There was a main effect of social context on SIQ
scores (F(1,154)=16.58; p<.001, hp2=.1) and on IOS scores
F(1,154)= 13.78; p<.001, hp2=.08). But there was not a
significant main effect of movement similarity on either
measure, and no interaction between social context and
movement conditions (all Fs<1).
Our manipulation check showed that there is strong
evidence that participants in the joint social context felt that
they were ‘dancing together’ more (Bayes factor 900:1), but
no evidence that this was affected by movement condition

Discussion
We found two surprising results. Firstly, participants did not
like each other more if they had been performing the same
actions, despite the clear prediction from a host of
behavioural coordination studies in the literature. Secondly,
they did feel closer to each other if they had been moving
together in a joint social context. This joint context was
established merely by attending to a common display. If
participants moved their bodies in the same way, in the same
synchronised fashion, but attended to two displays a few
degrees apart, then they did not feel increased affiliation
towards each other.
Standard mimicry and imitation theories cannot account
for these results. Their prediction is that, ceteris paribus,
when participants make the same movements, their affiliation
should be higher than when they are making different or

incongruent movements. However, our results did not
support this prediction, and Baysian analyses strongly
suggested that the likelihoods were in favour of there being
no effect of movement similarity at all.
How can we explain both our finding that affiliation is
dependent on social context, but also past findings that it is
caused by motor mimicry? One possibility follows the
associative sequence learning model, which holds that
‘mirror systems’ are the byproducts of learning sensorimotor
contingencies in a social context (Catmur, Walsh, & Heyes,
2009). From infancy, we perceive and perform the same
actions as others in the context of rewarding social
interactions (Heyes, 2001). These contingencies are learnt,
and in adulthood, they continue to produce mimicry,
associated with pro-social feelings. Critically, as Cook,
Dickinson and Heyes (2012) showed, these sensorimotor
contingencies become tied to the context in which they are
learned. So, crucially for our results, the sensorimotor
contingencies learned from multiple social interactions
would only be re-evoked in a social context. This provides a
plausible explanation of why only our joint dancing condition
affected affiliation: only when participants shared a screen,
they perceived themselves to be in a social situation in which
their actions were contingent upon one another.
Elsewhere in the literature, it has been shown that forms of
joint action and joint attention can have widespread cognitive
consequences. For example, there is interference between the
stimulus-response mappings of two people engaged in a
Simon task together (Sebanz, Knoblich, & Prinz, 2003).
When someone believes that another person is looking at the
same stimuli as them, it changes their visual attention
(Richardson D., Street, Tan, Hoover, & Ghane Cavanaugh,
2012) and memory encoding (Shteynberg, 2010; He, Lever,
& Humphreys, 2011). Pro-social feelings are also increased
when two people attend to the same stimuli (Fridlund, 1991;
Wolf, Launay, & Dunbar 2015). It seems plausible that our
participants who shared a screen cognitively framed their
activity in a particular manner (Huhn, Potts, & Rosenbaum,
2016), as a shared, joint activity, and from this, changes in
affiliation were produced.
The interrelated roles of movement similarity and social
context cannot be determined from previous results in the
literature. Past experimental studies have either confounded
social context with movement similarity, failed to manipulate
it explicitly, or used reduced, artificial stimulus-response
tasks. Indeed, our findings suggest that many past results
linking motor mimicry with affiliation may have occurred, in
part, because the experimental situation has established a
social context in which behavioural coordination is
interpreted as contingent. And we would predict that in a
silent disco, if two people do not share the same music, and
do not interpret their actions as shared and contingent, they
will not become friends as quickly.
