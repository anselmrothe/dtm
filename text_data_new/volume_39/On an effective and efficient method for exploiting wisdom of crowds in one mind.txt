Abstract
Previous studies have shown that one can exploit “wisdom of
crowds” by oneself. This is achieved by aggregating multiple
“quasi-independent” estimates from the same person. However,
previous methods were not necessarily easy to utilize. Therefore,
we propose an efficient method based on perspective-taking. The
procedure is as follows: First, one makes her/his own estimation.
Second, one estimates again based on a different perspective
(“general public”). Then these two estimations were averaged.
Two experiments revealed that our method effectively induced the
wisdom of crowds by oneself. More importantly, participants in
our method made estimations more quickly than those in a
previously proposed method, suggesting that our method required
a relatively diminished cognitive load for participants. Further
investigation suggested that our method was immune to adverse
effects of confidence. Therefore, the present findings show that our
method could be effective and efficient method for inducing the
wisdom of crowds in one mind.

accurate than the first estimates. Previous studies have
proposed some methods about how to exploit the wisdom of
crowds in one mind. Vul & Pashler (2008) proposed a
method in which individuals make estimations for the same
problem twice, with a time lag (2-weeks) between
estimations. Herzog & Hertwig (2009) proposed the method
called dialectical bootstrapping. In this method, people are
asked to make an estimation twice. In the second estimation,
they are provided an instruction (shown in Table 1, see
“dialectical” condition). This instruction asks individuals to
provide a different estimation from the first one, by
considering new knowledge that was once overlooked, or
searching out incorrect assumptions or considerations
present in the first estimate. These studies generally showed
that the average of the first and second estimates were more
accurate than the first estimate, and that the benefit of
averaging was larger than in the control condition (i.e., just
making estimations twice without any time lag or
instructions). Effectiveness of these methods has been

Introduction
“Wisdom of crowds” (Surowiecki, 2004) is the well known
phenomena, such that the aggregation of multiple estimates
made by large number of people is more accurate than the
estimate of a single individual. Recently, an intriguing
concept, termed “wisdom of crowds in one mind” has been
discussed in the research field of judgment and decision
making (e.g., Rauhut & Lorenz, 2011). In examining this
issue, researchers have discussed how a single person can
exploit “wisdom of crowds” in her/his mind. Herzog and
Hertwig (2014a) argued that this is achieved by averaging
“quasi-independent” multiple estimates from the same
person. A person’s estimate is not always constant and has
some variance, even for the same problem. Using such
inconstancy and variance, s/he can exploit the “wisdom of
crowds in one mind”. For example (see Figure 1), there is a
question with correct answer 50%. A person’s first estimate
was 30%. Imagine that s/he was asked to make the second
estimate, then her/his second estimate was 80%. The
average of two estimates would be 55%; a result more

confirmed repeatedly in subsequent studies (see Herzog &
Hertwig, 2014b for review).
However, these methods are not necessarily easy to
utilize. In the method proposed by Vul and Pashler (2008),

the time lag suggested (i.e., 2 weeks) is necessary to exploit
the wisdom of crowds within the mind of a single individual.
In the dialectical bootstrapping proposed by Herzog and
Hertwig (2009), a rather complicated instruction (Table 1) is
necessary. Furthermore, the first estimate has to be
presented to the person, which may not be necessarily
efficient as a method for inducing the second estimate. In
the present study, we propose a new method for exploiting
the wisdom of crowds in one mind, based on previous
findings on perspective-taking.

Perspective-taking of the “general public” for
exploiting the wisdom of crowds in one mind
Perspective-taking
Perspective-taking is the cognitive action to take another
point of view. This topic has been examined mainly in the
research field of social psychology. Previous studies have
revealed that perspective-taking changes peoples’ subjective
judgment or preference, such as stereotypes about a person
(Galinsky & Moskowitz, 2000). Furthermore, recent studies
have indicated that perspective-taking prompts people to
change estimates about objective values (e.g., the population
of the city or the date of historical event). Yaniv &
Choshen-Hillel (2012) implemented a perspective-taking
procedure in the advice-taking paradigm (for more
information on the advice-taking paradigm, see Bonaccio &
Dalal, 2006 for review). In this experiment, participants
were asked to generate an estimate about questions by
taking into account estimated values by others (these values
were given as advice). At this point, participants who were
asked to generate estimation at the point of another person’s
perspective tended to accept advice more than those who
were asked to generate their own estimation.
Based on these findings, it is predicted that estimations
vary depending on the perspective an individual takes.
Accordingly, we propose a method for utilizing wisdom of
crowds in one mind by taking others’ perspective. In our
method, we implemented a perspective-taking procedure in
the multiple estimates for the same question, to exploit the
wisdom of crowds in one mind. Specifically, we propose the
following procedure:
(1): A person makes her/his own estimation.

(2): S/he makes a second estimation based on a different
perspective. Specifically, s/he takes perspective of the
“general public” (Table 1, see “self-others” condition).
(3): Averaging the first and second estimations.

Merits of perspective-taking of the “general public”
We believe that taking the perspective of the "general
public” has some merits. First, different estimation may be
easily induced. Although estimations by the same person
tend to be analogous (e.g., control condition in Herzog &
Hertwig, 2009), people tend to believe that they differ from
the general public in some ways. For example, in comparing
driving ability, people tend to think that their ability is better
than the general public (e.g., Svenson, 1981), suggesting
that they believe “I am different from the general public!”
Thus, a different estimation may be induced by taking the
perspective of "general" individuals. Second, a different
estimate may be induced irrespective of confidence about
the first estimate. In making estimations, if people are
confident about their estimates, they may not change their
estimate when they are asked to make the second estimate.
Previous studies on overconfidence (e.g., Koriat,
Lichtenstein, & Fischoff, 1980) reveal that people tend to be
overconfident about the accuracy of their estimation. Thus,
in inducing a different estimate from the same person,
confidence (especially, as individuals tend to be
overconfident) may adversely affect results, as s/he may be
reluctant to change her/his first estimate when s/he is
confident about the first estimate. For example, in the
dialectical bootstrapping method (e.g., Herzog & Hertwig,
2009), people are asked to make the “self” second estimate,
even though they are provided an instruction to make a
“different” estimate. Therefore, this method may be affected
by the confidence in the first estimate, and an appropriately
different estimate may not be induced in the second estimate.
However, our method may correct for this. The current
procedure asks individuals to make the second estimate
from “other” people’s perspective. Hence, it is expected that
our method is relatively immune to the adverse effect of
confidence, and the nature of changing the estimate,
irrespective of confidence, may result in the effective
utilization of the wisdom of crowds in a single mind. Third,
anyone can imagine the general public. Leboeuf, Shafir, &
Bayuk (2010) showed that when participants were asked to

First, assume that your first estimate is off the mark. Second, think about a few reasons why that
could be. Which assumptions and considerations could have been wrong? Third, what do these

take the perspective of a particular group (“family” in Study
2), the participants who actually identified with this group
(“have a family” in Study 2) preferred the choice
corresponding to the perceived group perspective (e.g., a
family vacation). However, participants who were not
associated with this type of group (e.g., single) were not
influenced by this perspective-taking, suggesting that a
perspective-taking procedure cannot work effectively for
individuals that are not actually associated with the group.
Given that people can compare their driving ability with
general public (Svenson, 1981), people may be able to
imagine the “general” public.
In the following sections, we shall report two behavioral
experiments and discuss the effectiveness of our method.

participant level as follows: (MAD1-MADavg)/MAD1. 1 See
Figure 2 for examples.

Experiment 1
We conducted a web-based behavioral study in order to
examine whether our method effectively induced wisdom of
crowds in one mind.

formula of % MAD reduction averaging. (a) is an
example when averaged estimate is more accurate than
first estimate and (b) is an example when averaged
estimate is less accurate than first estimate.

Method
Participants A total of 452 participants were recruited for
this experiment through a Japanese internet research
company. Participants were randomly assigned into one of
three experimental conditions (self-others, n = 150;
dialectical, n = 151; self twice, n = 151).
Tasks and materials Participants were asked to answer
eight general knowledge questions, such as “What percent
of the world's airports are in the United States?” (Vul &
Pashler, 2008). Participants answered questions twice
following instructions (specific content will be reported the
below).
Procedure In all conditions, participants first provided their
own estimates about the questions. After answering all the
eight questions, participants provided second estimates
following the instruction for each condition (see Table 1). In
the self-others condition, we instructed participants to take a
“general public” perspective. In the dialectical condition, we
gave the instruction of the dialectical bootstrapping based
on Herzog & Hertwig (2009). In the self-twice condition, no
instruction was provided and participants just made second
estimate again.
The order of the questions for the first estimate was
randomized across participants and that for the second
estimate was the same as in the first estimate.

Results and discussion
Figure 3 shows % MAD reduction averaging for each
condition. In the self-others and dialectical conditions, %
MAD reduction averagings were significantly higher than
zero (self-others: M = 2.52, CI = [0.08, 4.75]; dialectical: M
= 2.20, CI = [0.50, 4.03]). Therefore, averaged estimates
reduced error compared to first estimates in these conditions.
In contrast, in the self-twice conditions, % MAD reduction
averaging was not significantly higher than zero (M = 1.34%, 95% CI = [-3.43, 0.67]). Thus, this method did not

Analysis
In the following analyses, we calculated “% MAD (= mean
absolute distance) reduction averaging” (Herzog & Hertwig,
2014a) as an index for the gained accuracy of averaging.
First, absolute distance between an estimate and the correct
answer was calculated per question for each participant. The
mean values of these were computed as MAD. MAD1
indicated MAD of the first estimates, and MADavg
represents the MAD of the averaged estimates. Then, “%
MAD reduction averaging” was calculated for each

significantly reduce error compared to the first estimates. A
pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test using a Bonferroni
correction revealed that in the self-others condition and
dialectical condition, % MAD reduction averagings were
significantly higher than that in self-twice condition (p
< .01; p < .05, respectively). These results indicate that our
method can exploit accuracy of averaging more effectively
than the method without any instruction, as with the method
proposed in Herzog & Hertwig (2009).
Although no significant differences between self-others
and dialectical condition was found (p > .1), our method can
exploit accuracy of averaging at least as effectively as the
method proposed by Herzog & Hertwig (2009) given that
the mean value of % MAD reduction averaging in the selfothers condition was higher than that in the dialectical
condition.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we used the same procedure with the
following two exceptions. First, we measured the response
time for the second estimate. Second, participants rated
confidence about their first estimates, and we analyzed the
relationship between the confidence and difference in the
two estimates (i.e., first and second estimates).

Results and discussion
Accuracy of averaging
In the following analysis, as in Experiment 1, we calculated
“% MAD reduction averaging” as an index for the gained
accuracy of averaging. Figure 4 shows % MAD reduction of
the averaging for each condition. In the self-others
condition, % MAD reduction averaging was significantly
higher than zero (M = 5.51%, 95% CI = [1.26, 9.56]). In
contrast, in the dialectical and self-twice conditions, %
MAD reduction averagings were not significantly higher
than zero (dialectical: M = 2.14, CI = [-1.18, 5.42]; selftwice: M = 1.60, CI = [-0.24, 3.54]). Thus, these methods
did not significantly reduce error compared to the first
estimates.
Although a pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test using a
Bonferroni correction revealed that in the self-others
condition, % MAD reduction averaging was not
significantly higher than that in the dialectical and the selftwice conditions (ps > .1), the % MAD was higher in the
self-others condition compared to the dialectical and the
self-twice conditions. Given that the % MAD reduction of

Method
Participants Japanese graduates and undergraduates from
the University of Tokyo (N = 77; 56 men and 21 women;
age M = 20.90, sd = 2.52) participated in this experiment.
They were randomly assigned into one of three
experimental conditions (self-others, n = 25; dialectical, n =
24; self-twice, n = 28).
Tasks and materials Participants were asked to answer
twenty questions about general knowledge based on Herzog
& Hertwig (2014a). Questions were answered twice, with
instructions, as in Experiment 1. In addition, in making first
estimations, participants were also asked to rate their
confidence for each estimation.
Procedure The experiment was individually conducted
using a computer. In all conditions, participants first
answered their own estimates about the questions, and rated
confidence about their estimates on a 100-point scale. After
answering all 20 questions, second estimates were made,
following instructions, as in Experiment 1. In the self-others
condition, we instructed participants to take the “general
public” perspective. In the dialectical condition, we gave the
instruction based on Herzog & Hertwig (2009). In the selftwice condition, no instruction was given, and participants
simply provided a second estimation.
The order of the questions for the first estimate was
randomized across participants and that for the second
question was the same as in the first estimate.

the averaging was significantly higher than zero only in the
self-others condition, our method could exploit accuracy of
averaging effectively, compared to other methods.

Response time in the second estimates
We analyzed total response time for the second estimate.
Figure 5 shows total response time for each condition (selfothers: M = 262.27, CI = [222.80, 303.69]; dialectical: M =
412.19, CI = [327.23, 499.90]; self-twice: M = 193.30, CI =
[164.67, 234.09].
Total response times were log-transformed and a pairwise
t-test using a Bonferroni correction was conducted. It was
found that in the self-others condition, participants finished
second estimates more quickly than the dialectical condition
(p < .05). Total response time in self-others condition was
longer than that in self-twice condition (p < .001). These
results suggest that participants in the self-others condition
could exploit wisdom of crowds in one mind with
diminishing more cognitive load than those in the dialectical
condition.

estimate. Absolute distance between the two estimates was
calculated for each question within participants, and a
correlation coefficient between the absolute difference and
confidence in the first estimate was calculated for each
participant. 2
Figure 7 shows distributions of correlation coefficients
for each condition. In the dialectical and self-twice
conditions, 95% confidence intervals about correlation
coefficients were less than zero (dialectical: M = -0.19, CI =
[-0.29, -0.086]; self-twice: M = -0.13, CI = [-0.21, -0.060]).
In contrast, for the self-others condition, 95% confidence
intervals about correlation coefficients included zero (selfother: M = 0.03, CI = [-0.040, 0.10]). These results indicate
that participants in the self-other condition tended to make
different estimations between the first and second
estimations, irrespective of their confidence. However,

Further examination about the three methods
The difference in first and second estimates To confirm
that our method exploited the difference of estimates, in the
following analysis, we calculated median absolute distance
(AD) to examine the distance between first and second
estimates (Herzog & Hertwig, 2014a). Median AD refers to
the median absolute distance between the first and second
estimates across 20 questions.
Figure 6 shows Median AD for each condition. In the
self-others and dialectical conditions, median ADs were
both larger than that in the self-twice condition (self-others:
M = 8.18, CI = [7.02, 9.28]; dialectical: M = 10.02, CI =
[8.48, 11.79], self-twice; M = 2.45, CI = [1.46, 3.46];
pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test using a Bonferroni
correction: ps < .001). There was no difference between
self-others and dialectical condition (p > .1). Therefore,
these results showed that our method could induce the
difference of estimates as in the dialectical bootstrapping.
Relationship between the difference in first and second
estimates and confidence We examined the relationship
between differences in the first and second estimates and
confidence. Generally, if a person is confident about the first
estimate, s/he may not change the second estimate. We
predicted that since the participants in the dialectical and
self-twice were asked to make “self” estimations, a negative
correlation might be observed between the difference in the
first and second estimates and confidence (i.e., s/he might
not change the second estimate when s/he was confident
about the first estimate). However, this might not be true for
the self-other condition because a person was asked to make
estimate from other people’s perspective in her/his second
estimate.
We analyzed the relationship between the difference in
the first and second estimates and the confidence about first

Two participants in self-others, two in dialectical, and one in selftwice conditions were excluded from analysis, as confidence data
was not collected.

participants in the dialectical condition made analogous
estimation in the second estimate as in that in the first
estimate when they were confident in the first estimate.
Given that wisdom of crowds in one mind tends to work
when a person makes different estimations in the two
estimations (e.g., Herzog & Hertwig, 2009), our method is
relatively immune to the adverse effect of confidence
compared to the dialectical bootstrapping.
Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between the
accuracy and the confidence in the first estimate. The
absolute distance between the correct answer and the first
estimate were calculated for each question within
participants, as an index for accuracy, and then we
calculated a correlation coefficient between these two values
for each participant. Figure 8 shows distributions of
correlation coefficients. 95% confidence intervals included
zero (M = -0.0032, CI= [-0.013, 0.0080]). This result
indicates that confidence was not related with the actual
accuracy.

confidence and distance.

General discussion
In the present study, we proposed a new method for
utilizing the wisdom of crowds in one mind, and we
examined whether our method was effective when
compared to another method proposed in previous studies.
Our findings were summarized as follows: First, we found
that our method effectively induced the wisdom of crowds
in one mind. Second, it was found that participants in our
method made estimations more quickly compared to those
in the previous method, suggesting that our method
diminished cognitive load for participants. Third, we found
that our method was relatively immune to adverse effects
(e.g., confidence), given that the previous methods require a
time lag or presentation of the first estimate (Vul & Pashler,
2008; Herzog & Hertwig, 2009).

Taken together, we believe that our method can be a more
effective and efficient method for inducing wisdom of
crowds in one mind.
