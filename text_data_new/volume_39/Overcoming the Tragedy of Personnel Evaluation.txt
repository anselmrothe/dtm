Abstract
Human beings are essentially – by nature or second nature members of groups. They contribute to these groups not just
as isolated individuals but also through their interaction with
others. Consequently, personnel evaluation in companies and
organizations requires assessing not only evaluating individual performance but also the overall direct and indirect effect
one has on a team. Others’ work may be improved or hampered by the presence of a particular employee. We investigate Two-level Personnel-Evaluation Tasks (T-PETs) with
information on individual and group earnings, where an
individual focus may lead to evaluate the overall best
employee as being the worst. We have previously found a
Tragedy of Personnel Evaluation where focus on direct
individual impact did have such systematic effect. In two
experiments, one on team size, the other on kinds of
information provided, we explore the boundary conditions of
this effect and suggest how it may be overcome.

Introduction
The success of teams in organizations or companies not only
relies on the direct performance of individuals, but often
also on interactions between team members (Mathieu,
Maynard, Rapp, & Gilson, 2008; Memmert, Plessner,
Hüttermann, Froese, Peterhänsel, & Unkelbach, 2015).
Individuals may, for instance, help or hinder each other. The
vital role of prosocial or altruistic behaviours for teams in
organisations and companies (George & Bettenhausen,
1990; Li, Kirkman, & Porter, 2014; Nielsen, Hrivnak, &
Shaw, 2009; Organ, 1997; Podsakoff, Whiting, Podsakoff,
& Mishra, 2010) and for functioning societies on the whole
is being increasingly acknowledged (Engel, 2011; Hendrich
et al., 2005; Gollwitzer, Rothmund, Pfeiffer, & Ensenbach,
2009; Post, 2005; cf. Melis et al., 2016). In Organizational
Psychology several types of contextual performance (Organ,
1997; van Scotter & Motowidlo, 1996) and prosocial
behavior (Brief & Motowidlo, 1986; Li, Kirkman, & Porter,
2014) have been distinguished. Researchers have also
pointed out that not only is prosocial behavior crucial for the
success of organizations, but that people are actually
sometimes rewarded for it (Organ, 1997; Scotter, Cross, &
Motowidlo, 2000; Grant & Patil, 2012, 562).
In previous work, we began investigating participants’
behaviour as hypothetical human-resource managers
evaluating employees working in different configurations

each shift (von Sydow & Braus, 2016). We employed Twolevel Personnel-Evaluation Tasks (T-PETs) that, across
several rounds (‘shifts’), provide information on how both
individuals and teams contribute to a store’s earnings. Crucially, the individual and team information suggest opposite
rankings of the employees’ contributions. By design, the
presence of a so-called ‘altruist’, someone who positively
affects the performance of the others, was most positively
correlated with the overall team performance (r = .99), even
though the altruist individually performed the worst. We
focused on the example of one employee strongly affecting
the whole group, as this case is influential in biological
models of altruism that assume an unconditional advantage
to all group members in the presence of an altruist (Sober &
Wilson, 1999; Wilson & Wilson, 2007; but Nowak &
Sigmund, 2005). The participants’ task involved evaluating
employees (Personnel Evaluation) and selecting the best
team (Personnel Selection). Participants saw only one group
(one shop) and the teams were assembled by selecting 4 out
of 5 employees (thus 5 team configurations were possible).
Results from von Sydow & Braus (2016) suggest what
they called a “Tragedy of Personnel Selection”. After 40
shifts, repeated measurement, and no time-constraint for
analyzing the data of a shift, participants systematically
judged the overall best employee to be the worst (on the
different hidden-profile problem, Mojzisch, Grouneva, &
Schulz-Hardt, 2010). Recently we also explored negative
interactions (egoist detection) in T-PETs (subm.). This
tragedy is reminiscent of the well-known “Tragedy of the
Commons”, a notion for the often tragic outcomes of social
dilemma situations (such as public-good games). Note
however, that the ‘T-PETs’ do not strictly involve social
dilemma, as the participant manager has the explicit goal of
choosing the best team for the company. It is only what has
been called an inner-individual dilemma (von Sydow, 2015)
between two levels of goal descriptions, since it is irrational
to optimize more specific goals at the expense of lowering
overall utility. Since positive (and negative) interactions
with other employees are ubiquitous, and number-based
evaluations are important in HR-management, these results
suggest such tragedy may well be found in everyday life.
Here we present two new experiments exploring the
generalizability or boundary-conditions of the tragedy.
Experiment 1 varies team sizes and begins exploring the
idea of multiple groups in parallel. Experiment 2
investigates longer learning periods and whether with forced
focus on the group level people are able to detect the
altruist.

Experiment 1
Design
In the T-PETs we provided information on both individual
and overall group level earnings. Experiment 1 investigates
the extent to which the Tragedy of Personnel Evaluation
depends on group size (number of workers: 3, 4, 5 versus 7)
and the number of groups (one versus two) (Figure 1, Table
1). From Conditions 1 to 4, group size increases. In a shift,
all workers apart from one are working. Condition 5 has the
same group size as Condition 4 but is characterized by a
group-comparison scenario, where the 6 employees are split
in two groups with three employees each.

from 7 for both groups. In the last round, we additionally
asked for the employee with the greatest and lowest utility,
and assigned a Need-For-Cognition-Task (Cacioppo, Petty,
& Kao, 1984), a working memory task, a Commentary, and
demographics.

Results

Method
Participants 221 Participants from the US began the
experiment via MTURK. 158 participants finished it,
passing all selection criteria (time spent on first page and
correct answer out of four, rephrasing the instructions). The
participants obtained a reward of 2$. 46% were male, the
mean age was 35 years; 53% mentioned having a Bachelor’s
or Master’s degree, and 39% a high school degree as highest
level of education. Participants were randomly assigned to
one of the five conditions.
Procedure and material The payoff structure for the
individual employees remains constant over the five
conditions, whereas the differing group sizes led to differing
earnings of the groups (Table 1). We adopted the repeated
measurement design with 18 shifts for each of the 4 rounds,
and at the end of a round a rating followed by a selection
task. The total number of shifts was 72. (This number is
higher than the 40 trials investigated in previous studies.) In
C3, for instance, the selection task was to select a team of 4
from 5 available workers that would be best for the
company (Figure 1). In C5 people could select 6 workers

Figure 2: Average ratings (with SE) for the normal
workers (N1-N6) and the altruist worker (A) of Conditions
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (Panels A to E).
Figure 2 shows that the rating for the altruist in all
conditions remained clearly below the other ratings. In an
ANOVA of the altruist ratings only, Condition is a
significant between-subject factor (F(4,153) = 3.57, p < .01)
and Phase (the four test phases) a significant within-subject
factor (Pillai-Spur-Test, PST, F(3, 151) = 3.92, p < .05),
with no further significant interaction effects (p = .32). This
outcome seems in line with the prediction that one obtains
the best results for the condition with the fewest workers

(C1), despite the altruist increased overall effect on the
mean group earnings in larger groups, and for the group
condition (C5). Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparisons
show significant differences between C1 and C4 (p < .01)
and between C4 and C5 (p < .05). However, the ratings
remain predominantly based on individual comparisons in
all conditions.

increase. However, Figure 4B suggests that there is also an
increase for C5 if one considers the stricter criterion of
rating the altruist to be higher than all other workers.
Figure 5A shows at least descriptively that in the highest
utility task the altruist is positively singled out relatively
frequently in C1 and C5 (but note the different numbers of
workers). Additionally, participants’ comments were
deemed ‘insightful’ if they detected possible differences between an individual’s direct and overall earnings (Figure
5B). Note that this measure is not directly affected by the
number of answer-options. There was a reliably higher
number of insightful comments in C1 than C2, C3 and C4,
but not higher than in C5.

altruist to be of highest utility. B) Insight rate shown in

excluding the altruist (A) or a normal worker (N) in the test
phases (Panel A to D) of the personnel selection task. The
dark shading represent selections based on individual
earnings, the light ones correspond to overall earnings.
Figure 3 shows that in all conditions the largest proportion of participants tends to expulse the overall most
useful worker, the altruist, from the team. This is clearly the
case in Phase 1 (always, p < .01). The proportion of other
choices overall increased over time (χ2(1, 316) = 13.15, p <
.001). Nonetheless altruist expulsion remained statistically
above chance in Phase 4 (apart from C1, p = .10; all other p
< .01). For the variable which worker is deemed to have the
least utility for the company (not presented here), in Round
4, the choice of the altruist even remained dominant for all
conditions (p < .01).

Overall, Experiment 1 shows that the tragedy is quite
stable over group size. However, it also suggests that
although the altruist’s summative effect increased with the
group size, the best participant performance was in the
condition with the lowest number of employees (C1). The
results also only showed subtle advantages of introducing
different groups on the altruist detection rate (C4 vs C5).

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 investigates conditions where people are
forced to focus on the group level only, to see whether all
participants realize that the altruist performs better on this
level. We thus investigate whether the tragedy of personnel
evaluation is due to an inability to see complex effects on a
group level (despite information concerning this level).
Additionally, and in contrast to Experiment 1, we distinguish different mean individual earnings of normal workers
to check the extent to which people distinguish even slighter
performance differences on the individual level.

(Table 2). In each test phase both evaluation and personnel
selection tasks were assigned. Additionally, in the last
round, highest and lowest utility tasks and other tests were
completed, as well as a Need-For-Cognition (NFC) test.
In the local-and-global conditions, participants were
provided with almost the same overview information as in
Condition 3 of Experiment 1 (only the Altruist individually
contributed 1600 instead of 1600). In each round,

information was given on both the direct earnings of the
four workers on a shift and the overall earnings of the shift.
The overall earnings involved not only the direct effects of
individuals but also their indirect effects. In the global-only
conditions, only the overall payoffs of a group (shift) were
presented, without showing individual contributions.

Results
Figure 10 shows the mean ratings for the workers’ contributions to company earnings. An overall ANOVA with
Workers (5 workers) and Phases (4 phases) as within-subjects factors, and Conditions as between-subject factor,
yielded a highly significant effect of Conditions × Workers
(Pillai-Spur Test, PST, F(12, 306) = 22.5, p < .001). This
corresponds to the predicted change of rank of the altruist’s
ratings in the global-only versus global-and-local
conditions. Additionally, the factors Workers, Phase ×
Condition as well as Phase × Worker approached
significance (PST, F(4, 100) = 17.3, p < .001; PST, F(9,
309) = 1.69, p = .09; PST, F(12, 92) = 1.51, p = .13).
Changes over the phases were not significant.

The homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions
correspond to either identical or different individual impact
of the normal workers (see Table 2). The group earnings
remained identical in both kinds of conditions. The ‘altruist’
(A) always has the most positive impact on the overall
earnings. NW earnings (€) without A were 2000
(homogeneous); 1400, 1800, 2200, 2600 (heterogenous);
with A, 3000 (homogeneous); 2400, 2800, 3200, 3600
(heterogeneous), but the altruist had the lowest direct
(individual) impact, 1600.

Method
Participants As in Experiment 1, relatively strict selection
criteria for participants were used to ensure high data
quality. After passing a first criterion (time spent on the first
page), 150 people properly started the task and 7 people
failed the second criterion (correct rephrasing of the task;
four options). Of the remaining 143 volunteers, 122 finished
the experiment, and only their data was analysed.
Participants were recruited from MTURK: 57% were male,
42% female; mean age was 33, and 68% had a Bachelor’s or
Master’s degree (with 32% a high school degree). They
received $2 for participation.
Procedure and material We used almost the identical
materials and procedure as in Experiment 1, C3. The experiment had 80 rounds, with four test phases administered after
Rounds 20, 40, 60, and 80. In all four test phases, participants completed both a personnel-evaluation task and a personnel-selection task. In the final test phase, we additionally
administered a highest-/lowest-utility task, a ranking task, a
Kimchi-Palmer item, an attention-test item, and an 18-item
Need-For-Cognition Test (Cacioppo, Petty, & Kao, 1984).
In the global-and-local conditions, the overview information presented in each round corresponds to C3 in
Figure 1. In the global-only conditions, the second line of
this panel (presenting the individual earnings of each
employee) was omitted.

Figure 6. Average ratings (with SE) in Experiment 4 for the
four normal (N) and altruist (A) workers in test phases P1 to
P4 of Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Panels A to D).
In the homogeneous local-and-global condition (C1, Panel
A), the altruist was again evaluated as the worst, despite
being most strongly correlated with high overall earnings. In
an ANOVA for Phase 4, the within-subject factor Workers
was clearly significant (PST, F(4, 23) = 10.1, p < .001), and
contrasts confirmed that all normal workers were rated
higher than the altruist (all, p < .05). In the heterogeneous
Condition 3, participants were well able to differentiate
between normal workers with different individual
performance. A corresponding ANOVA showed a general
effect of Workers (PST, F(4, 24) = 38.8, p < .001) and
significant contrasts between the workers in the predicted
order, N1 > N2 > N3 > N4 > A (each, p < .001).
In the global-only conditions (C2 and C4), in which
people were to base their ratings of a worker’s utility on the
teams’ overall earnings only, they clearly detected that, of
all workers, the altruist correlated most demonstrably with
high overall team earnings. Participants grasped this
surprisingly early. An ANOVA for C2 (test phase 4) shows

3463

significant results for the factor Workers (PST, F(4, 22) =
23.04, p < .001), and pairwise contrasts show that the
altruist is rated higher than all normal workers (always with
p <.001). In Condition 4, the order of the average ratings of
the altruist and the normal workers was likewise reversed
(relative to Condition 3). In an ANOVA a significant effect
of the factor Workers was found (PST, F(4, 26) = 15.5, p <
.001); and contrasts show that the altruist was rated
significantly higher than even the normal worker, who was
rated highest (p < .001). One ANOVA without the altruist
reached significance (PST, F(4, 27) = 3.62, p < .05), but
only one Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparison between
normal workers (the one expected to differ most: NW1NW4) led to significant results (p < .05). In sum, despite
clearly detecting that the altruist has a larger effect on overall output in the global-only conditions, participants show a
reduced ability to distinguish between the normal workers.
Figure 6 shows the proportion of ‘managers’ choosing a
worker to have the “highest” (Panel A) or “lowest” (Panel
B) “total utility for the company” in the final test phase.

Condition 4 (a global-only condition), even in Phase 1 the
optimal team-related selection (with-altruist team excluding
N4) was the most frequently selected (43 %), χ2(1, N = 32)
= 11.28, p < .001; and the no-altruist team, conversely, was
selected below chance (3 %), χ2(1, N = 32) = 5.70, p < .05.
In Phase 4, the selection of the no-altruist team was still
selected with low relative frequency (3 %), and the optimal
team by 59 % of participants.

Figure 8. The results of the personnel selection task in the
four test phases show the proportion of ‘managers’ choosing
a particular team, thus excluding either worker N1, N2, N3,
N4, or the altruist A. In the global-and-local conditions, C1
and C3, the black columns correspond to the predicted
selections based on individual performance only. In the
global-only conditions, C2 and C4, no individual-level
information was available. In all conditions, the dark gray
columns represent the optimal selection(s) based on overall
performance of teams.

Figure 7. Percentage of participants choosing a normal
worker (N) or the altruist (A) as of highest (Panel A) or
lowest (Panel B) overall utility for the company in Phase 4
in Conditions C1, C2, C3, and C4. The choices
corresponding to individual earnings are marked in black;
those corresponding to overall earnings in dark gray.
Figure 7 presents the team selections in the personnel
selection task. In Condition 1, we replicated a strong
tendency to select a team without the overall best member,
the altruist (from five possible configurations). Even in
Phase 4, after 80 rounds, 70% of the participants selected
this team, χ2(1, N = 30) = 46.88, p < .001. Its reduction was
not reliable, χ2(1, N = 60) = .80, p = .37. By contrast,
Condition 2 shows that participants provided with globalinformation-only were highly capable of quickly detecting
that the altruist should be part of the team (Phase 1, χ2(1, N
= 28) = 7.00, p < .001). Also the contrast between
Conditions 1 and 2 was highly significant (Phase 4), χ2(1, N
= 58) = 27.15, p < .001. In the heterogeneous global-andlocal Condition 3, selections began with a high proportion
of no-altruist team-choices in Phase 1 (Figure 12), χ2(1, N =
32) = 67.57, p < .001. In Phase 4, these individual-related
selections, which exclude A, are likewise found to be above
chance (56%), χ2(1, N = 32) = 31.01, p < .001; but now the
group-related selections are above chance as well (excluding
N4, with 34%); χ2(1, N = 32) = 4.13, p < .05. By contrast, in

In the local-and-global conditions we coded comments as
insightful that showed understanding of the differences
between an individual and a group level. After 80 learning
rounds, at least 38% of the participants in these conditions
were classified as providing comments with insight (33% in
C1 and 43% in C3). Of these participants, 87% selected the
altruist personnel selection task (in Phase 4), whereas from
the participants not demonstrating insight only 3% made
this selection. Finally, from the additional tests, only the
Need-For-Cognition Scale (2.6 vs. 10.5), t(60) = 1.93, p =
.03 (one-tailed) correlated with insightful comments.

General Discussion
Experiment 1 shows that the tragedy of personnel selection
is very stable across different team sizes. Even in the
smallest team, most participants in the role of ‘managers’
evaluated the most useful worker for the group to be the
worst. However, Experiment 1 suggests that small team
sizes mitigates this problem, and a minority in this condition
saw the difference between individual and overall
contribution of an employee. Experiment 2 shows that

3464

people are in principle well able to detect the strong
correlation between presence of the altruist and high team
performance (with r = .99) very early on from the grouplevel information. However, in other conditions most make
no use of this ability and seem to ignore the overall payoff,
focusing only on workers’ direct individual contribution.
More generally, the findings may be due to people’s
problems dealing with decisions involving a Simpson’s
Paradox (Fiedler et al., 2003; Sydow et al., 2016;
Waldmann & Hagmayer, 2001). If people do not merely
optimize in a standard decision-theoretic way (here by
simply choosing the team with the highest past
performance), and instead, as we suggest, aim for a deeper
understanding by identifying clear causal or logical patterns
between events (e.g., Funke, 2001; Hagmayer & Meder,
2013; Osman, 2010; Sloman & Hagmayer, 2006; von
Sydow, 2016; Waldmann & Hagmayer, 2001), this may
yield the disadvantage of overlooking small correlations,
pathways, exogeneities or interactions (Novick & Cheng,
2004), even if they may add up, tragically, to be the
predominant effect of a scenario.
