Abstract
Biological systems are capable of acting in a shared
environment to produce emergent, self-organized behavior that
is the result of the constraints imposed by local interactions–
such as bird flocking or ant swarming behavior. These
examples present minimal demands for a shared-intention
between co-actors, whereas other instances necessitate the
formation of a shared goal. In these goal-directed tasks, how
much of the observed complexity can be explained by the
constraints imposed by both the environment and adherence to
the shared task goal? This paper begins to investigate this
question by presenting results from a two-person cooperative
“shepherding” task first developed in Nalepka et al. (2017) but
with fewer constraints. Results provide further evidence that
the emergent behavior is the result of the constraints imposed
by the task. The included task-dynamic model suggests a
general model that can be used to understand multiagent
herding behavior in a variety of contexts.

Introduction
Emergent collective behavior in animal systems can
oftentimes be understood by agents whose behaviors are
constrained by local information. In non-human systems,
such as ant trails, the observed behavior to a food source can
be attributable to local interactions between ants and the
strength of a deposited pheromone trail (Deneubourg et al.,
1989). For humans, the route chosen to go to class in the

winter can be attributable to the paths carved in the snow by
previous students (Goldstone & Roberts, 2006). These
examples don’t necessitate the formation of a sharedintention (Searle, 1990) as these agents are exploiting their
environment to reach their own individual aims.
However, human actors can engage in complex goaldirected behavior such as playing in team sports where the
actors are working towards a common shared goal – a jointaction. Work discerning the neurocognitive mechanisms that
support the timing and prediction of actions have been
proposed to explain how human systems successfully
accomplish joint-action tasks (Vesper, et al., 2011). Indeed,
suboptimal coordination not only leads to sub-optimal
performance, but can have a negative impact on one’s selfesteem and one’s opinion of a co-actor (Lumsden, Miles, &
Macrae, 2014). Similarly, suboptimal coordination during
human-robot interaction (HRI) also leads to poorer
performance and a depreciated user experience, with users
often attributing poorer performance to a lack of
predictability and reciprocal compensation on the part of the
robot (Medina, Lorenz, & Hirche, 2015).
How much of the complexity observed in cooperative
action can be attributed to the constraints imposed by the
environment, as well as the task goal? An approach to
understand the behavioral dynamics that shape and constrain
natural human performance is to argue that humans organize
themselves as “special-purpose devices” to satisfy the
dynamics of a particular task (Saltzman & Kelso, 1987). For

2784

example, in a reaching task, the body self-organizes so the
hand becomes a damped mass-spring that moves towards,
say, a mug (a fixed-point attractor). These low-dimensional
models, in the case of reaching, can produce straight-line
trajectories and deal with perturbations that may occur during
the action.
To date, such task-dynamic models, expressed as ordinary
differential equations, have been used to understand human
path navigation and obstacle avoidance (Fajen & Warren,
2003; Warren, 2006) and tested in robotic systems, such as a
skiing robot (Lahajnar, Koss & Nemec, 2009). In the joint
action literature, virtual agents have also been created to
perform oscillatory movements with a human partner (Zhai,
et al., 2014; Kostrubiec, et al., 2015) with the movement
dynamics of the virtual agent defined by a coupled nonlinear
oscillator that produces patterns of coordination consistent
with the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model of rhythmic
coordination (Haken, Kelso, & Bunz, 1985); namely, stable,
or intermittent in-phase (0˚) and anti-phase (180˚) modes of
behavior. Perhaps most noteworthy is recent work by Zhai et
al. (2014) and Kostrubiec et al. (2015), who demonstrated the
ability for artificial agents incorporating nonlinear oscillatory
models to coordinate with humans to reproduce the dynamics
observed in human-human pairs, with the added benefit of
enabling these nonhuman agents to steer humans to new
coordinative modes that are unstable and difficult to master
(like a 90˚ phase relationship).
Recently, Nalepka et al. (2017) created a virtual
shepherding task (Figure 1) to explore and model goaldirected behavior in a multiagent task to understand how
stable social behavior emerges in more complex tasks with
changing environments. The task required pairs to coordinate
their movements in such a way as to corral and contain
reactive autonomous spheres (referred to as sheep) to the
center of a game field by controlling their player cube
(referred to as their sheepdog) with a handheld motiontracking sensor. In the beginning, participants engaged in a
behavior termed search and recover (S&R) which involved
moving one’s controller towards the farthest sheep so that the
sheep would be repelled towards the containment region.
Using this strategy, some pairs could meet the success criteria
for the task (defined as keeping all sheep within the
containment region for a certain proportion of time (see
Figure 1). However, a subset of successful pairs transitioned
to a new behavioral mode termed coupled oscillatory
containment (COC) that was functionally superior to S&R.
COC was defined by both participants performing oscillatory
movements around the containment region to wall-in the
sheep.
Interestingly, the COC behavioral mode exhibited similar
dynamic stabilities as prototypical interpersonal or visual
rhythmic coordination (Schmidt, Carello, & Turvey, 1990;
see Schmidt & Richardson, 2008 for a review) described by
the HKB model above, with pairs naturally exhibiting inphase and anti-phase patterns of COC behavior. Therefore,
the shepherding task supplies a functional consequence for
coupled rhythmic behavior that can be used to study

interpersonal coordination more generally. Videos
illustrating the shepherding task are found at

The Shepherding Model
Nalepka et al. (2017) formulated a task-dynamic model of the
human behavior observed in the shepherding task (also
Richardson et al., 2016); they also successfully validated that
this model, embodied in a virtual avatar, can complete the
task successfully alongside a human partner (Nalepka et al.,
2016). The model defines the task space in terms of a polar
coordinate system (see Figure 2). The radial component
(whose origin is the center of the containment region) of the
system is defined using the following damped mass-spring
equation,
𝑟̈𝑖 + 𝑏𝑟𝑖 𝑟̇𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 (𝑟𝑖 − 𝜉𝑖 (𝑟𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 + 𝛥𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖 )
−(1 − 𝜉𝑖 )(𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 + 𝛥𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖 )) = 0,
(1)
where 𝑟𝑖 , 𝑟̇𝑖 , and 𝑟̈𝑖 are the radial position, velocity and
acceleration of player i (i =1, 2); 𝑏𝑟𝑖 is the radial damping
term, 𝑟𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 is the radial coordinate of the player i’s radially
farthest sheep on their side of the field, (𝑟𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 + 𝛥𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖 ) is
the preferred radial target position that the player approaches
for this farthest sheep, and 𝜀𝑖 scales the strength of the
centrally-directed radial force attracting player i to the
targeted sheep. This force is gated by 𝜉𝑖 , a Heaviside
parameter:
0, 𝑟𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 < 𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖
𝜉𝑖 = { 𝑟
1, 𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 ≥ 𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖
(2)
If the radial coordinate of at least one sheep is greater than or
equal to 𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 , then the player will select the furthest
sheep, 𝑟𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 , and move to (𝑟𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 + 𝛥𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖 ); otherwise,
when 𝜉𝑖 = 0, the player will move towards (𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 +
𝛥𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖 ), their preferred distance from the center.
To be consistent with the previous research modeling the
dynamics of rhythmic human interlimb and interpersonal
coordination captured by the HKB model (Haken et al.,
1985), the angular component of the players’ movements
(centered on the player’s sagittal plane on their side of the

2785

angular component of their partner’s movement. This
coupling function reproduces both in-phase (0°) and antiphase (180°) stable relative phase relationships, with the
relative strength of these two coordination patterns defined
by the parameters 𝐴𝑖 and 𝐵𝑖 .

field) was modeled using the following modified set of
coupled Rayleigh/van der Pol hybrid nonlinear oscillator
equations,
𝜃̈𝑖 + 𝑏𝜃𝑖 𝜃̇𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖 𝜃̇𝑖3 + 𝛾𝑖 𝜃𝑖2 𝜃̇𝑖 + 𝜔𝑖2 (𝜃𝑖 − 𝜉𝑖 𝜃𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 )
2
= (1 − 𝜉𝑖 )(𝜃̇𝑖 − 𝜃𝑗̇ )(𝐴𝑖 − 𝐵𝑖 (𝜃𝑖 − 𝜃𝑗 ) ),
(3)
where 𝜃𝑖 , 𝜃̇𝑖 and 𝜃̈𝑖 are the angular position, velocity, and
acceleration of player i;. 𝜔𝑖 is a player’s natural angular
oscillation frequency; 𝑏𝜃𝑖 is the angular linear damping term;
𝛽𝑖 𝜃̇𝑖3 and 𝛾𝑖 𝜃𝑖2 𝜃̇𝑖 are Rayleigh and Van der Pol escapement
terms, respectively; and 𝐴𝑖 and 𝐵𝑖 are the parameters used in
the HKB model to define the relative strength of in-phase and
anti-phase coordination patterns. The parameter 𝑏𝜃 is
governed by the equation,
𝑏̇𝜃𝑖 + 𝛿𝑖 (𝑏𝜃𝑖 − 𝛼𝑖 (𝑟𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 − (𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑝𝑠(𝑡),𝑖 + 𝛥𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖 ))) = 0,
(4)
where negative values of 𝑏𝜃𝑖 produce oscillatory behavior,
while positive values produce fixed-point behavior.
Parameters 𝛿𝑖 and 𝛼𝑖 govern the dynamics of 𝑏𝜃𝑖 across its
range of allowable values.

Figure 2: Depiction of model task space. Player i = 1 is
exhibiting oscillatory behavior, while player i = 2 exhibits
S&R behavior. The smaller circles illustrate the sheep that
must be kept within the containment region (larger circle).
The interplayer system modeled by Eq. 1, 3 & 4 dictates
the behavioral mode player i produces. If 𝜉𝑖 = 1, the player is
uncoupled from their partner j (via the right half of Eq. 3),
and moves towards the angular component of the furthest
sheep; otherwise, the player will center their angular
component to 0° (here 𝑏𝜃𝑖 will move towards a negative value
and begin to produce oscillatory behavior). Parameter 𝜔𝑖 is
the rate at which these angular destinations are reached.
However, when 𝜉𝑖 = 0, the player becomes coupled to the

The Current Project
The behavioral modes observed in Nalepka et al. (2017) are
very like the behavioral modes found in real sheepdog
shepherding (Strömbom et al., 2014). However, it is unclear
whether the oscillatory behavior seen in Nalepka et al. (2017)
emerged from the local interactions of both players and the
sheep, or if it was due to participants attuning to pre-defined
environmental features of the task. Trajectories observed in
Nalepka et al. (2017) tend to trace the outer white circle of
the containment region (see Figure 1). In the original
experiment, this white circle indicated a failure criteria that
ended a trial if all sheep managed to escape. However,
anecdotally, some participants asked if they could enter the
containment region, opening the possibility that participants
perceived certain visually-marked locations to be appropriate
(like the white region) and others not (such as the red
containment area). Thus, the oscillatory behavior observed
may have been a consequence of this perceived task
constraint and the circular goal region.
The present work removed these visual landmarks and
edited the task to have fewer constraints to test the generality
of the developed task-dynamic model. Criteria that would
cause a trial to fail prematurely were removed, with
participants simply instructed to corral the sheep together,
without a target goal region in mind. To keep scoring criteria
similar to the original work, a containment region (invisible
to participants) moved in accordance with the center of the
herd, consistent with Strömbom et al. (2014) who suggested
that sheepdogs corral sheep that are furthest from the center
of the rest of the herd.
We tested a new set of naive participants to determine
whether S&R and, more importantly, COC behavior would
still emerge. We also compared the participant performance
to the performance of a slightly modified version of the
virtual shepherding model presented above. In short, the
model was modified so that the center of the task dynamic
space that defined the (0,0) point of the radial distance and
polar task axes was dynamically tied to the herd’s center of
mass (COM), as opposed to being fixed in the center of game
field (0,0). At any time t, the herd’s COM was calculated as
the average sheep position in Cartesian coordinates and was
subtracted from each game object’s (x,y) positions.

Method
Participants
Thirty-eight participants (M age = 18.82, 17-22), recruited as
19 pairs completed the experiment. All participants were
undergraduates from the University of Cincinnati and
received course credit for participation. For model
simulations, 10 artificial pairs were created with the

2786

following parameter values: 𝑏𝑟 = 10.9987, 𝜀 = 98.70672,
𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑝𝑠(𝑡) = .062 m, 𝛥𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛 = .061539, 𝛿 = 23.08993, 𝛼 =
80.59288, 𝛽 = .161641, 𝛾 = 7.22282, 𝜔 = 7.85, A = -.2, and
B = .2. The model was designed to perform COC behavior if
all sheep on the player’s side of the field was within

area, randomly centered either on the center of the game field,
or ± .50 m to either side. Forces from a random direction were
applied to each sheep at a sample rate of 50 Hz, resulting in
Brownian motion dynamics. If a sheep collided with the
fence, a repulsive force was applied to move the sheep back
towards the center. The sheep also dynamically reacted to the
participant-controlled sheepdogs as if threatened, being
repelled away from a participant’s sheepdog when the
sheepdog was within 12 cm of the sheep’s game location.
When threatened, the sheep would move directly away from
the player at a speed proportional to the inverse of the squared
distance between the sheep and the player. If the sheep were
red for at least 70% of the last 45 seconds of a two-minute
trial, the pair received a point. The experiment ended when
the participants scored eight points, or after 45 minutes,
whichever came first.

sheep arrangement.

Apparatus and Task
The task was designed using the Unity 3D game engine
(version 5.2.1; Unity Technologies, San Francisco,
California) and was presented to participants via Oculus Rift
DK2 (VR) headsets (Oculus VR, Irvine, California). The
virtual environment (Figure 3) was modeled at 1:1 scale after
the experimental room. The task was presented in the VR
headset to appear on a virtual tabletop modeled at 1:1 scale
to the glass tabletop in the real environment, which acted as
the solid physical surface on which participants could move
their motion sensors. Participants used wireless Latus motion
tracking sensors operating at 96 Hz (Polhemus Ltd, Vermont,
USA). Participants moved the sensor along the glass tabletop,
and hand movements translated 1:1 to movements of the
player’s cube (sheepdog) in the virtual environment.
Participants were given a body in the virtual world, modeled
after a crash test dummy of height 1.8 m whose motion was
controlled using an inverse kinematic calculator (model and
calculator supplied by Root Motion, Tartu, Estonia) based on
the real movements of the participant’s right hand (via the
Latus motion sensor) and head (via the Oculus Rift).
Participants could move their sheepdogs anywhere in twodimensional space within the 1.5 by 0.8 m fenced area of the
grass task field. The goal of the task was to jointly find a
solution to corral seven wool-covered stimulus spheres
(sheep) towards one another so that they turned to a red color.
The sheep were programmed to turn red when all sheep were
within 10.8 cm of the herd’s COM. Note, if the fence was
10.8 cm from the herd center, the sheep did not turn red. This
was done intentionally to keep participants from adopting a
strategy which involved keeping the sheep cornered. On each
trial, sheep appeared randomly within a .50 by .80 m boxed

Following informed consent, participants stood on either side
of the experimental table where they put on their respective
virtual headsets and were given a motion sensor to hold in
their right hand. Following calibration, participants were
informed about the task goal and the conditions for success
and failure. Participants were not told how near the sheep
needed to be to turn red. Instead, they were instructed that if
the sheep were not red, then they either needed to be closer
together, or that the herd was too close to the fence.
Participants were told that once the experiment began, they
were not allowed to speak with one another until after
debriefing. The experimenter remained in the room to enforce
the no-talking rule and to answer any questions.

Results
A preliminary review of participant behavior revealed that all
pairs exhibited S&R behavior and, more importantly, that
several pairs discovered and exhibited the same type of COC
strategy observed by Nalepka, et al. (2017). Here we present
the COC classification criterion utilized, and the performance
differences observed between COC trials (from the COCclassified pairs) and S&R trials (from S&R-classified pairs).
The focus of the analysis presented here was to confirm that
(a) COC is a robust emergent mode of behavior and (b) that
COC behavior was superior to S&R behavior. The results
from the model simulations followed the same analyses and
were employed to determine whether the task-dynamic
model could effectively capture the dynamics observed in
this less constrained task context. Classification and analyses
were conducted on the last 45 seconds of each two-minute
trial. This was set because participants were told that
performance was measured during this time and that the first
75 seconds was to be used as time to corral the sheep and
initiate resultant containment strategy. Because success was
defined as keeping the sheep within 10.8 cm of their COM,
all data were converted to polar coordinates with the center
located at the herd COM. For the purposes of this paper, only
successful trials were analyzed.

2787

As defined by Nalepka et al. (2017), a trial was classified
as COC if the peak angular oscillatory component was
between 0.5 Hz and 2 Hz. More specifically, the
classification criterion was as follows,
𝜑𝑖,𝑘 =

𝜔𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞,𝑖,𝑘 − .5
|𝜔𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞,𝑖,𝑘 − .5|

artificial pairs contained the sheep closer to the herd COM
(M = 2.32 cm, SD = .04, [p < .01]) and had less herd travel
(M = 8.92 cm, SD = .44, [p < .001]).

𝜔𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟,𝑖,𝑘 ,

(5)
where 𝜔𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞,𝑖,𝑘 is the peak angular oscillatory component for
player i, of pair k and 𝜔𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟,𝑖,𝑘 is its associated power. The
average for both players, 𝜑̅𝑘 , is taken and if the resultant
average is positive, the trial is classified as predominately
COC. Conversely, negative values resulted in a trial being
classified as an S&R trial. For analyses, the angular
component of each dog was detrended and z-score
normalized and submitted to MATLAB’s pwelch function
using a 50% overlap window of 512 samples.
Thirteen of the 19 pairs met the success criteria for the task.
One of the remaining six pairs had five of the eight successful
trials completed and were included in the analysis, while the
remaining five did not have a single successful trial.
Successful S&R trials had an average classification value 𝜑̅𝑘
= -0.47 and successful COC trials had a value 𝜑̅𝑘 = 0.23 for
human pairs, while it was 𝜑̅𝑘 = .22 for the artificial pairs,
which only exhibited successful COC trials. In total, nine
pairs exhibited predominately S&R behavior to complete the
task (with two pairs exhibiting one and three trials classified
as COC), while the remaining five pairs completed the task
with at least four trials classified as COC (M#trials = 5.8
classified as COC). The artificial pairs completed the
experiment in less time (M = 16.8 min, SD = 1.03) than both
S&R (M = 29.75 min, SD = 8.03) and COC (M = 26.00 min,
SD = 6.32) human pairs, F(2,20) = 12.75, p = .001, η2 = .56.
The following four variables were examined to
characterize performance differences between behavior
modes: (1) containment time—the number of seconds the
sheep were within 10.8 cm of the herd center while also 10.8
cm away from the nearest fence; (2) average sheep radial
distance—the average distance from the herd center; (2) herd
travel—the total distance travelled by the herd center; (4) and
herd area—the area of the convex hull formed by the set of
sheep positions. Only S&R trials were considered for S&R
pairs and COC trials for both COC pairs and artificial pairs.
Performance differences were found for all variables:
containment time, F(2,21) = 68.18, p < .001, η2 = .87, average
sheep radial distance, F(2,21) = 142.74, p < .001, η2 = .93,
herd travel, F(2,21) = 140.46, p < .001, η2 = .93), and herd
area F(2,21) = 11.61, p < .001, η2 = .53. Figure 4 provides a
summary of the findings. Performance by COC pairs on COC
trials were found to be superior to performance by S&R pairs
in all cases: containment time (COC M = 44.1 s, SD = 1.01;
S&R M = 39.91 s, SD = 1.42 [p < .001]), average sheep radial
distance (COC M = 2.73 cm, SD = .41; S&R M = 3.99 cm,
SD = .20 [p < .001]), herd travel (COC M = 62.74 cm, SD =
10.91; S&R M = 106.90 cm, SD = 19.16 [p < .001]) and herd
area (COC M = 23.87 cm2, SD = 13.80; S&R M = 55.66 cm2,
SD = 29.32 [p = .02]). Compared to COC human pairs, the

Conclusion
Consistent with findings by Nalepka et al. (2016; 2017), the
results provide further support that COC behavior is not a
consequence of players tracing a visually salient boundary to
contain the sheep, but rather emerges naturally from
interactions between players within the shepherding task
environment. Further, the task-dynamic model developed by
Nalepka et al. (2017) can be minimally modified to function
in this less constrained herding task space, by tracking the
center of the herd. It is important to note that seven pairs
completed the experiment without exhibiting any COC
behavior. This may be due to the relaxed scoring criteria that
allowed for stable S&R behavior. Increasing task difficulty,
like increasing the time needed to contain the sheep, is
predicted to cause more pairs to transition to COC behavior,
as it was associated with better task performance.
An approach to understand multiagent coordination is to
treat human systems as self-organized “special-purpose
devices” whose dynamics adhere to the constraints dictated
by the task and environment (Saltzman & Kelso, 1987;
Richardson et al., 2016). Task-dynamic models that embody
these constraints can be embedded in robot systems to
produce human-like behavior. Because the presented model
embodies the constraints inherent to herding autonomous
agents, the model can be extended to include systems that can

2788

work alongside humans in other herding-like tasks such as
fire evacuation and environmental hazard containment.
Similarly, these systems can potentially be used to steer
novices to discover more optimal modes of behavior – in the
shepherding task, but possibly in rehabilitation or educational
contexts in the future.
Finally, the shepherding model is symmetrical, but many
examples exist where distinct but complementary actions are
needed to reach a collective goal – for example a basketball
player performing a “pick” while their teammate breaks free
to take a shot. Work has been done to incorporate the recent
shepherding model by Strömbom et al. (2014) to two virtual
sheepdogs, who each are responsible for either collecting or
driving the herd (Watanabe and Fujioka, 2017). However, the
sheepdogs’ roles were rigidly defined and led to greater sheep
dispersion compared to single dog performance who could
adaptively switch between both modes. Models that allow
multiple agents to switch between multiple behavioral modes
without interference are still needed to develop systems that
can work fluidly alongside humans of various skillsets.
