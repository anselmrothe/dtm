Abstract
During a music lesson, participants need to co-ordinate both
their turns at talk and their turns at playing. Verbal and musical
contributions are shaped by their organisation within the turntaking system. When lessons are conducted remotely by video
conference, these mechanisms are disrupted by the asymmetric effects of delay on the interaction; in effect a “non-mutual
reality” comprised of two different conversations at each end
of the link. Here we compare detailed case studies of a copresent and a remote music lesson, in order to show how this
effect arises, and how it impacts conduct during the lesson.

Introduction
When a student and tutor come together for the purpose of an
instrumental music lesson, intuition suggests that the principal activity would be playing. However conversation is
important, not just as a way to analyse musical contributions, but to organise them within the lesson flow. Participants may respond to talk with performance and vice versa,
or even spend periods of time exchanging purely musical contributions (Duffy & Healey, 2014). For example the tutor
could give a verbal instruction that the student should action
through performance, or the student could ask a question that
the tutor answers through demonstration with their instrument. Activities are managed conversationally; discussion
interleaved with performance, demonstration and musical experimentation, resulting in a rich multi-modal social interaction. The musical contributions include unscripted exchanges
of short musical fragments intertwined with lesson dialogue.
Analysis of their shape and timing shows that they are managed in ways analogous to conversational turn-taking. For
example, a tutor’s musical contribution can be used to initiate student self-repair in their performance (Duffy & Healey,
2013). Non-verbal communication such as gaze, or maintaining spatial configurations with respect to each other and the
music stand, are also an important part of student-tutor interaction (Duffy & Healey, 2012).
The transition between speakers is an essential part of the
organisation of turn-taking in conversation (Sacks, Schegloff,
& Jefferson, 1974). The preference for just one person to
talk at a time requires participants to work together to minimise gaps and overlaps. Anticipating the possible end of a
speaker’s turn allows a listener to prepare to take the floor
when an opportunity presents itself. Interactive turn-taking

phenomena such as backchannels, or making a bid for the
floor for a turn at talk, require very precise timing. The timing of the transition between speakers is sometimes referred
to as turn offset. It is usually reported as positive if there is
a pause between speakers, and negative if there is an overlap
(Stivers et al., 2009). Longer pauses and overlaps do occur,
but the average turn offset in natural speech tends towards a
short pause. A positive turn offset in the range of 0-200ms is
most likely to be perceived as a smooth turn transition (Stivers
et al., 2009; Heldner & Edlund, 2010).
Remote music tuition using video conferencing is a popular way to support music education in geographically remote
areas but has also become an important part of urban mainstream conservatoires, for example to manage temporary separation when students or tutors have to travel to perform, or
to manage international auditions. However the medium of
communication is known to change aspects of conversational
turn-taking, and this has important implications for videomediated remote music tuition (Duffy et al., 2012). Even
minor disruptions to the transmission characteristics of the
medium of communication, such as the latency and delay associated with video mediated communication, can seriously
affect turn-taking (Whittaker, 2003).
Qualitative video analysis and conversation analysis (CA)
have been used to examine video-mediated workplace communication (Heath & Luff, 1991) and how participants complete collaborative tasks in video-mediated environments
(O’Conaill, Whittaker, & Wilbur, 1993; Heath, Luff, &
Sellen, 1997; Ruhleder & Jordan, 2001). However there have
been relatively few studies of the detailed effects of videomediated communication (VMC) on the timing of conversational turn-taking, and the results are inconsistent, driven
by subtle differences in experimental set up. For example,
some studies include signal delay (Ruhleder & Jordan, 2001)
whilst others exclude it (Sellen, 1992); in some cases specifically to isolate other interactional factors. Some studies
compare video-mediated interaction (with or without delay)
to same-room conditions, whilst others compare it to other
lower quality remote communication systems or audio only
scenarios (O’Conaill et al., 1993; O’Malley, Langton, Anderson, Doherty-Sneddon, & Bruce, 1996). Studies which have
included delay as part of their experimental set-up (O’Conaill
et al., 1993; Ruhleder & Jordan, 2001) suggest a further subtle effect; changes in the time of arrival of utterances with

1961

respect to ‘local’ sound. Ruhleder and Jordan (2001) suggest
that two people having two fundamentally different conversations with each other raises serious questions about what it
means to ‘share’ a conversation in distributed settings. This
leads to some interesting questions in terms of remote music
lessons. How might the medium change the turn transitions
observed in co-present lessons when they are mediated by
video conference? How might the transition between ‘speakers’ be affected by the inclusion of musical contributions?
In order to investigate these questions, a detailed study was
made of student-tutor interaction during a co-present and a
remote music lesson, using CA and qualitative video analysis. CA has previously been used to examine aspects of
instrumental music tuition (Ivaldi, 2014; Nishizaka, 2006;
Szczepek Reed, Reed, & Haddon, 2013), as well as the effect
of medium on conversational turn-taking. This fine grained
analysis of a same-room and a separated lesson allows us to
examine both the turn-taking characteristics unique to a music
lesson, and how these are affected by the medium of video.
This work is part of a larger study of a number of co-present
and remote music lessons (Duffy, 2015).

tion of a net offset for a period of time or subset of turn types.
Backchannels were excluded from the distribution, similar to
the approach used by Sellen (1992), since they are not a bid
for the floor or intended to initiate a change in speaker. As
discussed, a difference between this analysis and existing literature is that we consider the transitions between musical, as
well as verbal contributions. As a result, the following categories of turn transition were identified:

Methodology
Two one-to-one lessons featuring woodwind instruments
were observed, filmed and analysed in detail; a co-present
(‘same room’) lesson and a video-mediated remote lesson. The co-present lesson featured a male student studying
ABRSM grade 8 clarinet performance and was filmed during
one of his regular weekly lessons at the junior school of a
London Conservatoire. The female tutor had taught the student for many years. The remote lesson featured a female
oboe student taking part in an ensemble residency with Aldeburgh Young Musicians, filmed during a remote music tuition
study at Aldeburgh Music in Suffolk (Duffy et al., 2012).
The student had been working with the tutor during the residency, but had not previously taken regular lessons with her.
Both students had advanced to a similar level of proficiency;
they were largely comfortable with the technical challenges
of their instrument and capable of exploring musicality and
expression. Both tutors were experienced in one-to-one tuition, but not video mediated tuition. The scope of this study
was to examine student-tutor interaction, and did not consider
teaching effectiveness between conditions.
Conversational turns are defined as the period during which
a participant holds the floor, until there is a change in speaker
(Sacks et al., 1974, pp.702-703). Turns in the footage from
each lesson were coded using ELAN (Brugman, 2004). A
separate tier was created for analysis of each of the following
types of contribution: student talk, tutor talk, student play and
tutor play. This data was exported as a transcript with timecode information so that calculations could be made such as
turn frequency, mean turn duration and turn onset in relation
to the preceding turn. Pauses between turns were coded as a
positive offset, and overlap as a negative offset, similar to the
approach used by Stivers et al. (2009). This allowed calcula-

The two rooms used for the remote lesson were adjoining
suites at the same organisation (see Duffy et al. (2012) for
more details). A separate video camera was placed in each
suite, in addition to the video conference equipment, in order to capture student and tutor position with respect to the
screen and provide a separate audio recording for each location. There was a small delay in visual processing caused by
additional software being tested during the lesson. A delay
was added to the audio so that audio and visuals arrived synchronised in each location. Audio samples from each room
were synchronised and analysed using clearly visible audio
transients which did not overlap with local sounds. Whilst
the rooms were geographically close, the delay was of the
same order as the latency experienced in a typical transatlantic video call (0.9s). This delay was constant, but in reality
the magnitude of the delay would vary somewhat over the
duration of the call, depending on the signal journey through
different servers and exchanges.

Results
First we will look at some general effects of the medium
on the lessons analysed. Whilst the co-present lesson was
slightly longer than the consolidated sections of the videomediated class analysed, they both contained similar proportions of instances of turns at talk (73% and 71% table 2) and
instances of musical contributions (27% and 29% table 2).
However the turn structure within this was quite different.
The co-present lesson contained 753 turns in total whilst the

1962

video mediated lesson contained just 234, and the average
length of both turns at talk and musical contributions were
significantly longer for the video-mediated lesson. Net mean
offset for the remote lesson was 337ms, 143ms longer than
the co-present lesson offset of 194ms (table 3). These results are consistent with findings that video-mediated conversations are characterised by fewer turns of greater length and
reduced overlapping speech (Cohen, 1982; O’Conaill et al.,
1993; Sellen, 1992).

pauses, interspersed with backchannels by the student. The
backchannels were placed with precision to show attentiveness without making a bid for the floor or disrupting the tutor’s turn. Non-verbal cues enabled the student to determine
when these turns were complete and they should start to play
(Duffy, 2015, pp. 140-148). As the next example shows, in
the remote lesson the student found this more difficult.

Next we examine the net offset by transition type. In the
co-present lesson, the net offset for turn transition type talk
following talk, representing periods of student-tutor discussion, was 287ms (table 3). This was slightly outside the range
of 0-200ms from the literature, but still showed a preference
for a pause of the same order of size. For transition type play
following talk, for example a student performing in response
to a verbal instruction from the tutor, the co-present net offset
was again in line with the literature (297ms, table 3). In the
remote lesson, the net offset for transitions of talk following
talk decreased to 39ms in line with our expectations from the
literature, but the net offset for play following talk lengthened
considerably to 993ms.
Looking specifically at overlap by participant, the student
showed a preference to play over tutor talk (33 instances of
student play over talk overlap compared to 2 tutor instances table 4). One explanation for this is that in co-present lessons
tutors were found to make long instructional turns to initiate student play, comprised of several utterances separated by

The tutor asked the student to play a scale. When the tutor paused after her first utterance, the student made physical
preparations to play such as stepping back from the screen
and raising her hands to the instrument body (transcript 1:
line 1 and transcript 2: line 2). However the tutor retained
the turn, choosing to demonstrate by playing the scale herself
(transcript 1 and 2: line 3). Towards the end of the scale the
student raised her clarinet to her mouth again, this time placing the reed in her mouth (transcript 1: line 4 and transcript
2: line 5). However the tutor started a new utterance “so I
mean you go C sharp to C sharp” and the student lowered her
oboe again. This was the second abandoned attempt to play.
At the end of this utterance the student nodded and raised her
oboe for a third time. She placed the reed in her mouth and
took an in-breath whilst the tutor talked (transcript 1: line 6).
The tutor made no further utterances and finally the student
moved into playing the scale. From the tutor room footage it
was not clear why the student made two preparations to play
which could not be followed through. From the student room
footage it was clear that the student was placing these actions
in the pauses that were interpreted as the end of the tutor’s
instructional turn. This happened several times, and towards
the end of the lesson the student exclaimed “sorry sorry it’s
hard to know when to play”. This example is analysed in
more detail in Duffy (2015, pp. 350-359).

Bidding for the floor to provide feedback
Transitions involving turns following play did not follow the

tended towards overlap in the co-present lesson, rather than a
short pause (-61ms and -70ms table 3). Talk following play
tended towards overlap in the remote condition (-40ms table
3). Play following play tended towards a pause in the remote
condition (net offset 124ms) but the proportion of this type of
turn was significantly reduced to just 2%, or 4 turns. All but
one incidence of talk over play overlap was made by the tutor,
in both the co-present and remote lesson (table 4), evidencing
the tutor’s preference to talk over student play when a problem was been diagnosed in order to provide feedback. This
did not appear to be as disrupted by the medium as the previous example, perhaps because the length of the note during
which the tutor bid for the floor was often of the same order
as the duration of the delay (Duffy, 2015, pp. 245-263), so
the tutor’s interruption still arrived before the student could
start the next musical phrase. What is beginning to emerge is
asymmetry in the preferences for taking a turn to talk or play
between the participants, some of which are disrupted more
by the medium than others.

Next we will look at an example which demonstrates the effect of the delay on the placement of a single turn. Audio
waveforms from each room illustrate the effect in addition to
the transcripts (figure 1). Coloured blocks have been annotated using Logic Pro 9 to highlight the different position of
parts of the dialogue shown in transcript 3. The tutor waveform is narrower because the camera in the tutor room was
further away from where the tutor was positioned, as a result
the waveform has smaller amplitude (vertical height representing volume). This does not affect our analysis. The two
audio samples were synchronised using the visual transients
in the tutor’s utterance “ba ba ba ba ba ba” (line 3 of transcript 3). Transcript 3 shows the difference in turn transition
and sequence between the two rooms.

Transcript 3: Turn sequence discrepancy between rooms
There are two main differences between the audio samples.
The first relates to the student’s utterance “Yeah fine” in line
2 (circled section of the waveform in figure 1). This utterance
was made with respect to the tutor’s turn in line 1. In the student room audio the response followed straight on, after the
noise of a door slamming at the end of the tutor’s turn. In the

1964

Figure 1: Audio discrepancy between rooms.
tutor room audio there was a 0.8 second pause after the tutor said “Cause the A sharp is always there from the crotchet
rest”. When the student utterance “Yeah fine” arrived, the tutor had already started talking again, so it overlapped with the
start of the tutor’s next comment “You’ve just got it”. From
the student’s perspective, she had replied as soon as she heard
the tutor’s comment. However her reply was delayed in its return to the tutor by 0.9s. When the student’s response arrived,
the tutor had already started to talk again having only heard
silence, and so she talked over the student’s response. As a
result, the student’s utterance “Yeah fine” was placed within
a pause in the tutor’s speech, but transformed into an overlap
with tutor speech when received in the tutor’s room. Several examples of similarly misapplied feedback are reported
in Ruhleder and Jordan (2001).
The next example shows how turn sequence can be
changed. Examining the student audio first, the musical
phrase in line 1 of transcript 4 includes a pause notated in
the score before a phrase is repeated. The student makes this
pause 0.4 seconds in duration and starts the repeated phrase
in line 2. However the tutor appears to talk over this second phrase with “May-maybe a” (line 3). This is unusual,
the tutor usually waits until the end of a musical phrase to
start talking, the only overlap being with the final note (Duffy
& Healey, 2013); here the tutor starts talking mid-phrase. It
is also unusual that the student does not stop playing, instead
the tutor stops talking and the student continues. The tutor interjects again with “yeah” but the student still continues. The
tutor then talks again straight after the last note of the phrase.
Now the student stops playing, immediately looking up from
the music and at the screen.
Looking at the tutor room audio, shown in the second half
of transcript 4, we see that the tutor started the utterance
“May-maybe a” during the notated pause in the student’s performance (transcript 4: line 2a). However the delay in trans-

mission of this utterance to the student room, meant that it
arrived after the student had started to play the next phrase in
line 2. In the tutor’s room “May-maybe a” was interrupted by
the student starting her second phrase in line 3a and the tutor
stopped talking. Her next utterance “yeah” in line 4a started
during a long note played by the student, which could be interpreted as a bid for the floor. However when this utterance
arrived in the student room, the long note was already complete and the student had moved on to the next phrase. From
the tutor’s perspective she had tried unsuccessfully to take the
floor at the end of the first phrase.

Discussion
The short fragments of music which occur during an instrumental lesson have been shown previously to be managed
conversationally, and share some characteristics with turns at
talk. Here we see that participants exhibit different preferences for how they manage transitions between verbal and
musical contributions. The tutor more often leads lesson

flow, placing more of the responsibility for turn placement
onto the student in their responses. The tutor is also more
likely to bid for the floor during student play, whereas the
student rarely interrupts the tutor in talk or play. Differences
in preferences have also been reported in turn-taking associated with the roles of the teacher and students in a classroom
(McHoul, 1978). The signal delay associated with VMC disrupts these preferences, exhibiting a greater effect on the student. Ruhleder and Jordan (2001) suggest that the mechanisms which are most affected by signal delay are conversational turn-taking, sequence organisation and repair; affecting trust and confidence between the participants. The
phenomenon analysed here may explain student frustrations
previously reported during remote music lessons (Duffy &
Healey, 2012). This study highlights a number of opportunities for further work. For example, it is not known if participants could acclimatise to aspects of the disruption to lesson
interaction over time. A longitudinal study is recommended
which follows student-tutor pairs taking both co-present and
remote lessons. In this way, any effect caused by change in
participants across conditions will also be controlled. There
may also be different, more effective, ways to represent the
naturalistic teaching interaction remotely through alternative
technologies (Duffy & Healey, 2017).
