Abstract

different modalities. In visual domain, duration judgments
were observed to be longer for larger numbers (Xuan et al.,
2007; Oliveri et al., 2008; Vicario, 2011), stimulus size
(Ono & Kawahara, 2007), stimulus luminosity (Goldstone,
Lhamon & Sechzer, 1978), and complexity (Schiffman &
Bobko, 1974). For example, people were more accurate and
faster when classifying the duration of smaller magnitude
numbers presented for a shorter time (congruent trials) than
smaller magnitude numbers presented for a longer duration
(incongruent trials) in a Stroop-like paradigm (Xuan et al.,
2007). The effect of stimulus size on perceived duration has
also been documented in many studies (e.g.,Ono &
Kawahara, 2007; Xuan et al., 2007; Rammsayer & Verner,
2014). For example; when categorizing the durations of
stimuli of different sizes by pressing one of four keys (“1”
for short and “4” for long) in a temporal categorization task,
people perceived larger visual stimuli as lasting longer
compared to smaller visual stimuli of an equivalent duration
(Ono & Kawahara, 2007).
Although the studies cited above each investigate the
effects of non-temporal magnitude information on perceived
duration, to our knowledge, no study so far has investigated
the effects of the temporal magnitude (i.e. duration) implied
by word stimuli on time perception. If there is an effect of
magnitude on subjective time estimations, then we should
be able to see the same effect of magnitude information
derived from the semantic representations activated by
linguistic stimuli. However, how semantic representations
of duration and magnitude information encoded by
individual words interact with the representation of duration
is mostly unknown.

Subjective duration estimates are positively related to the
magnitude of various non-temporal stimuli (e.g. Xuan et al.,
2007). Our study investigated whether temporal and spatial
magnitude information conveyed by linguistic stimuli would
affect perceived duration in a temporal reproduction task. We
used time-related words referring to different exact durations
(e.g. second; Experiment 1), and spatial-temporal metaphors
(e.g. long), referring to indistinct temporal as well as spatial
magnitudes (Experiment 2). In both experiments, participants
over-reproduced the shorter target duration (2.4 s) and underreproduced the longer target duration (4.8 s). In Experiment
1, participants under-reproduced the longer target duration
more when they saw “week” in the training and “year” in the
reproduction. Yet, we did not observe the same semantic
magnitude effect in other word pairs either in Experiment 1 or
2. Overall, we did not find supporting evidence for magnitude
information conveyed by language affecting subjective time
estimates.

Introduction
The perception of time is a key feature of many biological
and behavioral processes. Although accurate timing is
essential to many daily tasks, substantial evidence shows
that the subjective experience of time is not perfectly
isomorphic to physical time (Zakay, 1993). Rather,
perceived durations are contracted or dilated depending on
many factors, including changes in non-temporal stimulus
properties.
In this study, we investigated how perceived durations are
modulated by temporal magnitude information provided in
the medium of language.

Interaction Between Language Processing and
Low-Level Sensory/Perceptual Processing

The Interaction Between Non-Temporal Stimulus
Magnitude and Perceived Duration
Subjective duration estimates are positively related to the
magnitude of various non-temporal stimuli presented in

A growing body of research investigating the interaction
between language and perceptual processing suggests that
semantic representations activated as we process linguistic
stimuli affect the content-specific domain of low-level

1477

sensory and perceptual processing (Glenberg, Kaschak,
2002; Zwaan, 2004; Kaschak et al., 2005). According to
theories of embodied language processing, comprehension
involves the perceptual and motor simulation of the
situation described in the linguistic input. Thus, the
comprehension of words referring to a particular modal
event should interact with low-level perceptual processing
of that event (Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002;
Zwaan, 2004; Kaschak et al., 2005). Many behavioral
studies have provided evidence for an interaction between
comprehension and perceptual processing, suggesting that
higher-level semantic knowledge influences low-level
sensory processing in visual perception (e.g. Spivey et al.,
2001; Stanfield & Zwaan, 2001; Zwaan, Stanfield &
Yaxley, 2002).
While the effects of language-activated semantic
information on cognitive processing across a range of
domains has been investigated, the effects of temporal
magnitude representations activated by duration words and
metaphors on the content-specific area of perceptual
processing, namely duration perception, has not been
studied. The present study aimed to fill this gap, in order to
provide evidence informing both the duration perception
and language processing literatures. To this end, in two
experiments, we investigated how participants’ reproduced
duration estimations of a target interval are modulated when
presented as different word types: 1) distinct temporal
magnitudes (i.e. duration words; e.g. week vs. year) or 2)
indistinct magnitudes or durations (i.e. spatial-temporal
metaphors; e.g. long vs. short).

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we investigated how words referring to
different exact durations (e.g. second, year) affect duration
estimations. We hypothesized that when the word in training
refers to a shorter duration compared to the word presented
in the reproduction (e.g. seeing the word “second” in the
training and “minute” in the reproduction), participants
would under-estimate (i.e. over-reproduce) the target
interval and vice versa. We did not expect any systematic
difference in reproduced duration estimations when
participants are presented with the same words in both
reproduction and training.

Method
Participants
Twenty-five Koç University students (16 females,
Mage=21.7) agreed to participate in exchange for course
credit. We discarded one female subject because her average
coefficient of variation (CV) was high (average CV across
conditions = .51). All experiments were approved by the
Institutional Review Panel for Human Subjects of Koç
University.

Task and Stimuli

We used a temporal reproduction task. In this task, we asked
participants to reproduce a given target duration by pressing
a pre-designated response button to approximate the target
duration as closely as possible.
At the beginning of a trial, a word (“training word”) was
visually presented for one of two different target intervals
(2400 ms or 4800 ms). At the end of the target interval, a
blank screen was presented for 1 second, followed by a
fixation cross presented for a random interval between 500
ms and 1500 ms. Participants were then instructed to initiate
the reproduction interval by pressing the space bar. Upon
pressing the spacebar, another word (“reproduction word”)
appeared at the center of the screen, remaining for the
entirety of the reproduction interval. The interval ended
when the reproduction was perceived as temporally
equivalent to the target and the participant released the
spacebar. Following the termination of the reproduction
interval, the next trial was presented after a random interval
between 1000 and 2000 ms.
In Experiment 1, we chose four words referring to
different exact durations in Turkish: saniye (“second”),
dakika (“minute”), hafta (“week”) and sene (“year”).
There were two conditions presented in two different
sessions. In Condition 1, the words appearing in training
and reproduction were different (different word pairs). In
this condition, we created two-word pairs out of these four
words: (“second”) vs. (“minute”) and (“week”) vs.
(“year”). The order of the words also changed. Thus, in
some trials participants saw the word referring to the shorter
duration during training (e.g. “week” in training and “year”
in reproduction) and vice versa (e.g. “year” in training and
“week” in reproduction), making four different training
word - reproduction word pairs. In Condition 2, however,
the same word appeared both in the training and the
reproduction intervals (same word pairs). Thus, in this
condition, four words appeared both in training and
reproduction (e.g. “week” in training and “week” in
reproduction, etc.).

Procedure
All words were presented at the center of the screen, printed
in white on a black background. There were 30
presentations for each training word-reproduction word pair
at each of the target durations. Hence, in each session, for
two target durations and four word pairs, there were 240
experimental trials. We also added 24 trials (10% of the
experimental trials) in which the target words appeared for a
random interval between 500 and 5000 ms. We added them
in order to avoid participants to habituate the two target
intervals and label them as “short” and “long” durations
throughout the experiment. the selected target intervals as
“short” and “long” durations. Thus, in each session, there
were 264 trials in total, 240 of which were used in the
analyses. All trials were presented randomly. Additionally,
to verify that participants looked at the screen, we asked
them to report the last word they saw on the screen on 12

1478

randomly selected trials. Participants who could not
correctly identify the words three or more times were
discarded from analyses (Only one participant in
Experiment 2 was discarded on this front). Each participant
completed the two sessions and the order of the sessions
was counterbalanced across participants. Each experimental
session lasted 50-60 minutes and was separated by a
minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5 days.

Results
For every participant, we calculated the normalized
reproduced time (i.e. the reproduced duration divided by the
target duration) and averaged those scores for each word
pair-target duration combination. Also, for each participant,
we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV; i.e. standard
deviation of each condition divided by its mean) for each
condition. Reproduced intervals that were greater than three
times, or smaller than one third of the target duration were
excluded from the analyses. Also, the mean normalized
reproduction scores and CVs that were above and below
three standard deviations of the sample mean for any of the
word pairs for a specific target duration were treated as
outliers and excluded from further analyses.
The mean normalized reproduction times across target
durations for second vs. minute and week vs. year can be
found in Table 1. This table presents the over-reproduction
of the 2.4 s duration and an under-reproduction of 4.8 s
duration regardless of the word pair type (same vs.
different) or the specific word pairs used.

standard errors of the mean.

There was no effect of sex (all ps >.19) and the order of
the conditions (all ps >.18) in any of the word pair–target
duration combinations. Also, there was no interaction
between sex and the session order (all ps > .22).
In Condition 1, we conducted three-way repeated
measures ANOVA. The results showed that word pairs, F

(1, 20) = 116.56, p < .001, target duration, F (1, 20) =
110.72, p <. 001, and the order of the word referring to the
shorter duration, F (1, 20) = 40.60, p < .001, had significant
main effects. However, these main effects were qualified by
an interaction between all three repeated factors, F (1, 20) =
49.66, p < .001. Further comparisons showed that, for week
vs. year, reproduced durations were greater when week was
given in reproduction (M = .80) compared to training (M =
.60) only when they were presented for 4.8 s.
In Condition 2, we conducted a two-way repeated
measures ANOVA and found a main effect of the target
duration, F (1, 21) = 73.35, p < .001, and the same word
pairs, F (3, 63) = 4.38, p = .007. Pairwise comparisons
showed that the mean normalized reproduced durations
were greater for 2.4 s for all same word pairs compared to
4.8 s (Mdiff = .34, p < .001). However, there were no
significant differences between any of the same word pairs
when we consider Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels of .008
per test (.05/6) in the pairwise comparisons. There was also
no interaction between target duration and same word pairs,
F (3, 63) = 1.50, p = .22.
To investigate the difference between the same and
different word pairs, we averaged the mean normalized
scores for the same and different word pairs separately and
conducted a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The
results showed only a main effect of target duration, F (1,
19) = 92.18, p < .001. There was no difference between
same and different word pairs, F (1, 19) = 3.09, p = .095 or
the interaction between word pair type and target duration,
F (1, 19) = 3.26, p = .087.
A two one-way ANOVA with all word pairs regardless of
the word pair type (same vs. different) and the order of the
shorter duration as repeated measures and CV scores as
dependent measure was conducted separately for each target
duration. For 2.4s, there was no significant effect of word
pair on CV scores, F (4.14, 95.18) = 1.30, p = .25. However,
for 4.8s, there was a main effect of word pair, F (7, 161) =
78.65, p < .001. Pairwise comparisons revealed that CVs
were greater when participants saw “week” in the training
and “year” in the reproduction compared to all other word
pairs in 4.8 s (all Mdiff > .173, all ps < .001). To see whether
variability in perceived durations differed between
Condition 1 and 2, we computed grand total CVs for same
and different word pairs separately for each target duration
and conducted a two-way repeated measures ANOVA.
Results revealed a main effect of the target duration, F (1,
19) = 92.18, p < .001. The CVs were greater for 2.4 s (M =
1.172) compared to 4.8 s (M = .806). There was no main
effect of the word pair type (same vs. different), F (1, 19) =
3.09, p = .095 and no interaction between two, F (1, 19) =
3.26, p =.087.
In sum, in Experiment 1, we found that regardless of the
word pair type and specific order, participants overreproduced the target duration of 2.4s and under-reproduced
4.8s. We also found that participants under-reproduced 4.8s
more when they saw “week” in the training and “year” in
the reproduction compared to all word pair conditions. The

1479

2.4 s

CV was also greater for that word pair (“week-year”)
compared to all other.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we investigated how words implying both
a temporal magnitude as well as a spatial magnitude
modulated duration estimations. To this end, we employed
quantifiers that can refer metaphorically to different
indistinct durations as well as spatial magnitudes (i.e. the
size of an object; e.g. long vs. short). Our hypotheses were
same as with Experiment 1.

Method
Participants
Twenty-five Koç University students (14 females, Mage=21)
agreed to participate in exchange for course credit. One
male participant was discarded because he did not pay
attention to the experiment and one female participant was
discarded because her mean normalized reproduced scores
were outliers in 10 out of the 16 conditions.

Task, Procedure & Stimuli
The task and the procedure were identical to Experiment 1,
except for the word stimuli used in the task. In Experiment
2, we used spatial adjectives and adverbs that are used as
spatial-temporal metaphors referring to indistinct durations.
We chose four words: uzun (“long”), kısa (“short”), geniş
(“wide”) and dar (“narrow”). In Condition 1, participants
were trained with a spatial-temporal adjective and presented
with the antonym of that word in the reproduction phase.
We created 2 word pairs: “long” vs. “short” and “wide” vs.
“narrow”. The order of the words was reversed in this
condition. In Condition 2, participants saw the same spatialtemporal adjective both in training and reproduction.

Results
We used the same exclusion criteria as in Experiment 1. The
averaged mean normalized reproduced intervals for short vs.
long and narrow vs. wide for each target interval can be
found in Table 2. Visual inspection of Table 2 suggests the
over-reproduction of 2.4 s and an under-reproduction of 4.8
s in both word pairs.

Neither sex (all ps > .12) nor the order in which
participants attended the two conditions (all ps > .09)
affected the normalized reproduction scores in any of the
word pair-target duration combinations. Also, there was no
interaction between sex and the session order in any of the
conditions (all ps > .15).
For Condition 1, we conducted a three-way repeated
measures ANOVA. The results revealed only a main effect
of target duration, F (1, 19) = 122.96, p < .001. The mean
normalized reproduction scores were greater in 2.4 s (M =
1.29) compared to 4.8 s (M = .86) for all different word
pairs. There were no main effects of the specific word pair
(short vs. long and narrow vs. wide), F (1, 19) = .286, p =
.599, or the order of the shorter duration, F (1, 19) = .147, p
= .706. Also, there was no interaction between all three
repeated factors, F (1, 19) = .013, p = .910.
For Condition 2, our analysis revealed only a main effect
of target duration, F (1, 20) = 69.56, p < .001. Pairwise
comparisons showed that the mean normalized reproduced
durations were greater in 2.4s (M = 1.18) compared to 4.8s
(M = .81). There was no main effect of the same word
pairs, F (3, 60) = 2.095, p = .110. There was also no
significant interaction between same word pairs and target
duration, F (3, 60) = 2.39, p = .078.
We conducted two separate two-way repeated measures
ANOVA with the averaged mean normalized reproduced
durations for the same and different word pairs for each
target duration. The results showed only a main effect of
target duration, F (1, 17) = 87.54, p < .001. There was no
significant difference between the averaged normalized
reproduced durations for same and different word pairs, F
(1, 17) = 2.70, p = .119. Also, there was no interaction
between two repeated factors, F (1, 17) = .999, p = .334.
With participants’ CV scores, we conducted a two-way
repeated measures ANOVA with all word pairs and the
target duration as the two repeated factors and the CVs as
the dependent measure. The results showed a significant
effect of target duration, F (1, 22) = 35.338, p < .001.
Pairwise comparisons revealed that CVs were greater in 2.4s
(M = .260) compared to 4.8s (M = .213). There was no
difference between any word pair, F (3.31, 72.83) = .639, p
= .607. However, these results were qualified by an
interaction between two, F (7, 154) = 2.674, p = .012. The
follow-up multiple t-tests show that, when we consider
Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels (.05/8 =.0062), CV scores
were greater in 2.4s in word pairs “long-short” (M = .271),
“wide-narrow” (M = .276), “short-long” (M = .259),
“narrow-wide” (M = .265), “wide-wide” (M = .252) and
“narrow-narrow” (M = .255) compared to the target

1480

duration of 4.8s (M = .207, .204, .201, .211, .208, .218;
respectively).
In sum, in Experiment 2, we found an over-reproduction
of 2.4 s and an under-reproduction of 4.8 s regardless of the
word pair conditions, as in Experiment 1. However, we did
not find any difference in mean normalized reproduced
duration between any of the word pairs. We also found that
CVs were greater in 2.4s compared to 4.8s for all four
different word pairs as well as two of the same word pairs
(“short” and “wide”).

General Discussion
In this study, we asked how language affects time
perception. Specifically, we investigated how the temporal
magnitude (Experiment 1; duration words) and spatialtemporal magnitude (Experiment 2; spatial-temporal
metaphors) implied by words influenced subjective time
estimates as assessed in temporal reproduction task. We
hypothesized that increasing the magnitude conveyed by
words from training to reproduction would lead to the overreproduction of the target duration, and vice versa. We
found that (1) in two experiments, participants overreproduced 2.4s and under-reproduced 4.8s, regardless of
the implied temporal / spatial magnitude of words (Figure 1
and 2), (2) CVs were greater in 2.4 s compared to 4.8 s in
both experiments, and (3) participants’ reproduced durations
were smaller and CVs greater when they saw “week” in the
training and “year” in the reproduction in 4.8s compared to
all other conditions in Experiment 1. Last, (4) we did not
find any systematic effect of the temporal/spatial magnitude
implied by words on perceived duration in both
experiments.
The over-reproduction of 2.4s and the under-reproduction
of 4.8 s in our current study are in line with Vierordt’s Law
(for a review see Lejeune & Wearden, 2009) and found in
many timing studies in the literature across multiple timing
tasks (e.g., Karşılar & Balcı, 2016). This migration effect,
which is the regression of duration estimates toward the
mid-range of the target duration series, is likely due to the
fact that all word pair–target duration conditions were
presented randomly (i.e. interleaved) rather than in blocks.
We also detected a trend that CVs were greater for 2.4s
compared to 4.8s. According to Weber’s Law, although the
variation of the reproduced duration increases
proportionally with the to-be-timed intervals, these results
might be best explained by an additive source of variability
due to experimental manipulations (other than duration) in
addition to the proportional one due to timing mechanism
itself (e.g. generalized form of Weber’s Law).
In Experiment 1, we found that the word pair week-year
was under-reproduced more when presented for 4.8s
compared to all other word pairs. It means that participants
thought of the target duration of 4.8s as shorter when
“week” in the training was followed by a word implying a
larger temporal magnitude, like “year”. However, we did
not see the same effect in other exact duration word pairs in

Experiment 1 and spatial–temporal metaphor pairs in
Experiment 2. This might be due to the larger temporal
magnitude difference between these two words compared to
the other word pair. Furthermore, the opposite effect was
not observed for the year-week pair suggesting an
asymmetrical form of time warping (see also Karşılar &
Balcı, 2016). Further investigation is needed to determine if
this effect is reliable.
Overall, we could not find supporting evidence for the
effect of language on time perception. Both temporal
magnitude and temporal/spatial magnitude information
conveyed by words did not affect perceived duration (other
than the word pair of week-year in 4.8s). Yet, it should be
noted that there is no hypothesized model for the interaction
between time perception and language. Thus, the current
study is an exploratory one. However, in a recent study,
Bottini and Casasanto (2010) investigated the effects of
implicit spatial length information encoded in different
object nouns (e.g. cigarettes, clothesline, footpath) on
perceived duration and found a positive effect of spatial
magnitude information conveyed in linguistic medium on
time perception. Object nouns with relatively shorter
implicit spatial lengths (e.g. cigarette) were remembered as
appearing for shorter durations compared to nouns with
longer implicit spatial lengths (e.g. footpath) despite each
being presented for the same amount of time. However, we
did not find the same kinds of effects. It is interesting when
we consider that we used direct spatial magnitude
information in Experiment 2, rather than an implicit one as
in Bottini and Casasanto (2010). One possibility for falling
short to replicate the findings of this study might be that the
previously documented effects of magnitude on time
perception are only for spatial and numerical magnitude (i.e.
non-temporal) and not for temporal magnitudes. In other
words, those findings might be present only for crossdomain effects. In the current study, however, we tested the
impact of duration magnitude on duration perception, which
is a within-domain interaction. Yet, in Experiment 2, we
used spatial–temporal metaphors that implied both temporal
and spatial magnitudes. One reason for the null effect in this
experiment concerns the everyday use of spatial –temporal
metaphors. Space and time are so intertwined that spatial
adjectives are commonly understood as temporal concepts,
especially in the context of a time reproduction task (Lakoff
& Johnson, 1980).
Another possible explanation for not finding data to
support our hypothesis in both experiments, concerns the
nature of our to-be-timed stimuli. Larger, more complex,
and intense stimuli expand perceived duration (Eagleman,
2008). One mechanism for this effect is the modulation of
attention and arousal by the non-temporal properties of the
to-be-timed stimulus. For example, intense negative sounds
expand subjective duration since they heighten
physiological arousal (Mella et al., 2011). Also, apart from
emotional valence, attentional modulation by highly
dynamic stimuli might affect duration perception. For
example, Karşılar and Balcı (2016) found that higher motion

1481

coherence in a highly dynamic moving dot array may
capture more attention to the non-temporal properties of the
stimulus at the expense of attention to the timing task itself.
This may result in the over-reproduction of a target interval
when the coherence level is increased from training to
reproduction. However, our stimuli were not emotionally
arousing nor attention capturing. Also, magnitude was not
inherently perceptible in the to-be-timed stimuli, but implied
by words. Concrete, visual magnitude information presented
as an inherent property of the external stimuli might affect
perceived duration by better directing attentional resources
to stimulus properties.
Last, the task we used might not be the most sensitive for
exploring the possible effects of language on perceived
duration. Other tasks, like temporal bisection (Allan &
Gibbon, 1991) or categorical timing (Wearden, 1992) that
force participants to decide on whether the perceived target
duration is shorter or longer compared to a reference
interval, might better detect differences between conditions
due to its specificity to perceptual time in future studies.
In sum, the current study did not support the hypothesis
that temporal and spatial magnitude information conveyed
by linguistic stimuli influences subjective duration
estimations. Limitations of the current study and the absence
of an hypothesized model to be rejected prevent strong
conclusions, but higher-order linguistic representations may
not reliably interact with a low-level domain like interval
timing across experimental paradigms.
