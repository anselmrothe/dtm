Abstract

people track such mathematical regularities? Here, we
claim that people use a sophisticated set of mechanisms to
evaluate mathematical explanations. We argue that people
(1) are sensitive to the conceptual structure of arithmetic,
(2) construct mental proofs over this structure, and (3)
evaluate those proofs using principles that mirror the
history, philosophy, and practice of mathematics.
Just as there are intricate connections among concepts
in physics and biology, so are mathematical concepts
richly structured (Whitehead & Russell, 1910). For
example, geometric facts are grounded in facts about
analysis (Bolzano, 1817), and arithmetic facts in set
theory (Frege, 1974/1884). More basically, subtraction
can be viewed as grounded in addition, multiplication in
addition, division in multiplication, and so on (Figure 1;
see also Dedekind, 1995/1888; Tao, 2016). Although
these concepts need not be viewed asymmetrically, these
asymmetries may be psychologically natural. For
example, people may follow the principle that more
fundamental operations begin with small things and
assemble larger things, rather than vice versa. This would
make addition more fundamental than subtraction (which
breaks larger things into smaller pieces).
We explored the intuitive conceptual structure of
mathematics using a simple method—asking people to
evaluate mathematical explanations. Consider the
explanation “9÷3=3 because 3+3+3=9.” In one sense, this
is a terrible explanation because it is tautological—both
facts are necessarily true and logically equivalent.
However, we propose that people are willing to evaluate
explanations of this sort, and do so as if constructing a
mental proof of the explanatory target (here, “9÷3=3”)
from the putative explanation (“3+3+3=9”), over the
conceptual structure in Figure 1. For example, to evaluate
“9÷3=3 because 3+3+3=9,” one would first derive a
multiplication fact (“3´3=9”) from the addition fact, and
then derive the division fact from that intermediate
multiplication fact. We test two principles that people
might use for evaluating implicit mental proofs.
First, people may be sensitive to the asymmetric nature
of mathematical explanation (Bolzano, 1817; Kitcher,
1975). For example, consider the explanation “4-2=2
because 2+2=4.” Although tautological, if this
explanation respects a perceived conceptual order, it may
be seen as superior to an explanation that does not, such
as “2+2=4 because 4-2=2.” That is, a statement may be
explained in terms of a logically equivalent statement, if
that explanation helps to highlight the more conceptually
primitive facts grounding it.

Mathematics is critical for making sense of the world. Yet,
little is known about how people evaluate mathematical
explanations. Here, we use an explanatory reasoning task
to investigate the intuitive structure of mathematics. We
show that people evaluate arithmetic explanations by
building mental proofs over the conceptual structure of
intuitive arithmetic, evaluating those proofs using criteria
similar to those of professional mathematicians.
Specifically, we find that people prefer explanations
consistent with the conceptual order of the operations
(“9÷3=3 because 3´3=9” rather than “3´3=9 because
9÷3=3”), and corresponding to simpler proofs (“9÷3=3
because 3´3=9” rather than “9÷3=3 because 3+3+3=9”).
Implications for mathematics cognition and education are
discussed.
Keywords: Mathematics cognition; philosophy of
mathematics; explanation; reasoning; concepts and
categories.

Introduction
People track statistical regularities and use these
regularities to make sense of the world. Some statistical
learning abilities emerge early: Infants use statistics to
extract complex visual features (Fiser & Aslin, 2002) and
form categories (Gómez & Lakusta, 2004). Statistical
generalizations are also critical for sense-making in
higher cognition. For example, adults and children prefer
simpler causal explanations in part because they have
higher prior probabilities (Bonawitz & Lombrozo, 2012;
Johnson, Valenti, & Keil, 2017; Lombrozo, 2007).
Yet, we also seem to track other truths that do not rely
on statistical regularities—Platonic, logically necessary
regularities such as mathematical truths. From early on,
people use mathematical truths to make sense of the
world: Even young infants know that if two puppets
venture behind a screen, and one comes out, then only one
puppet remains behind (Wynn, 1992). Without an
understanding of mathematics (i.e., 2–1=1), this event—
and many others—would be inexplicable. Mathematical
explanation grows even more essential in adulthood, as
consumers must account for their spending, programmers
must understand the logic of their code, and CEOs must
explain their bottom line. For this reason, educators
increasingly emphasize the explanatory function of
mathematics (Schoenfeld, 1992). For example, the
Common Core Standards (2010) state that “one hallmark
of mathematical understanding is the ability to
justify…why a particular mathematical statement is true
or where a mathematical rule comes from” (p. 4).
But to what extent, and by what mechanisms, can

quality, but also that people spontaneously construct
proofs over the conceptual structure depicted in Figure 1.
Our model assumes that people evaluate these
explanations by constructing and evaluating a proof of the
explanatory target from the base, using the transformation
rules given in Table 1. These correspond to the forward
(F) and reverse (R) version of each arrow in Figure 1 (see
Rips, 1983 for a related idea in propositional reasoning).
Proofs are evaluated by assuming a rule cost is incurred
for applying each rule, and that the total proof cost is the
sum of the costs of the individual rules invoked in the
proof. If people are sensitive to proof complexity, then
they should prefer proofs with smaller costs. To capture
the idea that people prefer explanations consonant with
the conceptual order, our model allows forward and
reverse rules to have different costs: We predict that
reverse rules carry a higher cost than forward rules. That
is, a proof has a higher cost to the extent that it uses more
rules in general, and more reverse rules in particular.
Equivalently, short proofs flowing with Figure 1’s arrows
would correspond to better explanations than long proofs
flowing against the arrows (see examples below).

Note. Numbers correspond to the proof rules in Table 1, with
forward proof rules flowing in the direction of the arrows and
reverse proof rules flowing against the direction of the arrows.

Method
We recruited 97 participants from Amazon Mechanical
Turk in exchange for a small payment (50.5% female,
Mage = 34.0). Participants were excluded from data
analysis if they gave inappropriate answers to the check
questions (N = 6; see below for details).
Participants rated a series of 30 mathematical
explanations. For each explanation, participants were
asked “How satisfying do you find this explanation?” on a
scale from 0 (“not at all satisfying”) to 10 (“very
satisfying”). These explanations consisted of all possible
pairings of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
exponent, and root operations, where the constituents
were 3s; examples are given in Table 2 in the Appendix.
For example, across different blocks, participants
completed a pair of multiplication/exponent items:
32 = 9 because 3 ´ 3 = 9 [forward]
3 ´ 3 = 9 because 32 = 9 [reverse]
Because there are 15 ways of pairing these 6 operations
with each other, and two orders (forward and reverse),
participants completed a total of 30 items. The forward
and reverse items were presented in separate blocks, with
the order of the items randomized within each block. The
order of the blocks was also randomized.
Check questions were included after the test questions
to detect participants who were responding randomly.
These always included two items for which one of the
equations was false (e.g., “4+3=7 because 4+3=2” or
“743+259=1,002 because 743+259=713”) and two items
for which the numbers differed between the two equations
(e.g., “26´47=1222 because 678-234=444”). Participants
with average answers to these questions that were above
the scale midpoint were excluded from data analysis.

Table 1: Hypothesized rules for mental proofs.
Second, people may prefer explanations that involve
fewer steps because such proofs more readily confer
understanding (Descartes, 1954/1684; Hardy, 2004/1940;
Kitcher, 1983) and are less prone to error (Hume,
1978/1738). For example, “9÷3=3 because 3+3+3=9”
might be seen as a worse explanation than “9÷3=3
because 3´3=9,” since the proof for the former
explanation requires two steps (addition to multiplication,
multiplication to division) whereas the latter requires only
one step (multiplication to division), even though both
proofs proceed in the same conceptual order. We test
whether people scale their explanatory judgments to proof
complexity. If so, this would be evidence not only that
people use complexity as a criterion to judge explanatory

mean in the rightmost column of Table 3) and the
operation that explains the most (i.e., the highest mean in
the bottom row of Table 3). In contrast, subtraction is
least easily explained and explains the least.
Group-level model fitting. We model the results in
terms of the sum of the rule costs, shown in Table 2. This
analysis assumes that the cost of each rule is determined
only by whether it is a forward or reverse rule. Thus, one
free parameter R/F is used, reflecting the extent to which
R rules were penalized more heavily than F rules.
We modeled the explanation ratings in terms of the
summed rule costs, where only the R/F parameter was
free to vary. These scores were good predictors of the
explanation ratings, r(28) = –.86, p < .001. The best
fitting value for the R/F parameter was 1.18, indicating
that the explanatory cost of applying reverse rules that go
against the conceptual grain of mathematics is 18% higher
than the explanatory cost of applying forward rules. This
supports our conjecture that forward explanations (e.g.,
explaining subtraction in terms of addition) are preferred
to their logically equivalent reverse explanations (e.g.,
explaining addition in terms of subtraction).
This asymmetry between forward and reverse rules is
also evident from looking at the means in Table 3. For
example, explanations of subtraction in terms of addition
were rated more satisfying than explanations of addition
in subtraction, since the former grounds an operation in a
more psychologically basic operation whereas the latter
does the opposite. Since there are five rules in Table 1,
there are five directly reversible pairs, as well as four
pairs of operations (addition/division, addition/
exponentiation, addition/root, and multiplication/root) that
are connected by applying two or more rules in the same
direction (see Proof column in Table 2). Averaging across
these pairs, the forward explanations were seen as more
satisfying than the reverse, t(90) = 3.90, p < .001.
Individual-level model fitting. Our model also
captures individual participants’ explanatory judgments.
To test the proof complexity factor, we calculated, for
each participant, the correlation between the explanatory
judgment for each of the 30 items and the number of rules
required for that item’s proof (i.e., the sum of the F and R
columns in Table 2). This parameter-free model captured
a substantial amount of the variance within each
participant’s response pattern, with a mean correlation of
–.46 between number of rules and explanatory judgment
(Fisher-transformed to a z-score before averaging, and
inverse-transformed back to a correlation). Furthermore,
almost all participants (95.6%) had a negative correlation,
demonstrating that the excellent model fit at the group
level is not due to a small subset of participants, but
instead generalizes across almost all participants.
Although this parameter-free model is useful in
showing that considerable within-subject variability can
be explained via proof complexity, it is less useful for
testing asymmetries between the forward and backward
rules, since this requires estimating the relative penalties

Participants were sensitive to both criteria of conceptual
order and proof complexity. We first describe the results
relative to the qualitative predictions of the model in order
to explain how the model works, and then assess the
quantitative fit at both the group and individual levels.
Qualitative model predictions. We anticipated that
people would penalize explanations to the extent that the
most direct proof requires applying a large number of
rules (see Tables 1 and 2), and that application of
‘reverse’ rules would correspond to a greater penalty.
These two principles are captured by (1) computing the
shortest distance between the two operations in Figure 1,
and (2) penalizing the explanation for each arrow along
that shortest path, with arrows in the ‘reverse’ direction
receiving a larger penalty (we call this penalty R) than
arrows in the ‘forward’ direction (a smaller penalty of F).
For example, consider explaining a root formula in
terms of division (e.g., “Ö9=3 because 9÷3=3”).
According to our model, people would rate this
explanation by producing a mental proof of ‘Ö9=3’ from
‘9÷3=3’. As noted in Table 2, this requires the application
of three rules: 3R (to derive ‘3´3=9’ from ‘9÷3=3’), 4F
(to derive ‘32=9’), and finally 5F (to derive ‘Ö9=3’). Two
of these rules are forward and one is backward, so the
total penalty is 2F + 1R—since this is a relatively high
penalty, we would expect this explanation to be rated
poorly. In contrast, addition would be seen as an excellent
explanation of subtraction, because a subtraction formula
(e.g., ‘9–3–3=3’) can be derived from addition
(‘3+3+3=9’) using only one forward rule (1F), leading to
a penalty of only 1F. The penalty scores for several of the
explanations are given in Table 2 in the Appendix, along
with the rules required to perform these proofs.
This model captures several patterns in the means
(Table 3 in the Appendix). First, for each operation, we
can consider which explanation was rated highest (i.e., the
highest mean in each row of Table 3). For the addition
operation, which is not conceptually dependent on any of
the other operations, its highest rated explanations were
subtraction and multiplication—the closest downstream
operations. For both subtraction and multiplication,
addition is the highest rated explanation, consistent with
the topology of Figure 1, wherein both operations depend
directly on addition. Similarly, for explaining division and
exponentiation, multiplication is highest rated, consistent
with Figure 1, in that both operations depend directly on
multiplication. Finally, for roots, exponentiation was seen
as the best explanation, again consistent with the direct
dependence of roots on exponents.
More generally, our model predicts a central role of
multiplication and a peripheral role of subtraction. As
Figure 1 shows, multiplication is a central node in the
conceptual structure of arithmetic—most roads lead to (or
from) multiplication—but subtraction is on the periphery.
This prediction is borne out by the data. Multiplication is
both the most easily explained operation (i.e., the highest

614

associated with each rule. To do so, we conducted a linear
regression for each participant, using ten dummy-coded
variables to represent whether each of the ten rules figures
in each item’s proof. For example, for the item explaining
division in terms of subtraction, the dummy variables for
rules 1R, 2F, and 3F were set to 1, and all others set to 0.
For each participant, we calculated the regression weights
for each rule, reflecting the relative penalty associated
with each rule (thus, all regression weights would be
expected to be negative), and these weights (averaged
across participants) are depicted in Figure 2.

preferred explanations that obeyed the conceptual order of
mathematics and which required fewer derivational steps.
Where might these intuitions come from? One
possibility is that they are rooted in a more basic
understanding of the natural numbers (e.g., Carey, 2009;
Dehaene, 1997; Rips, Bloomfield, & Asmuth, 2008) that
begins to emerge early in development. For example,
addition and subtraction are intimately related to
counting, both in development (Rips et al., 2008) and in
mathematics (Tao, 2016). This is because the natural
numbers are constructed by using the successor function
(e.g., 9 is the successor to 8). Such psychologically and
mathematically primitive mechanisms may underlie lateremerging explanatory intuitions.
Alternatively, could it be possible that people simply
parroted explanations as introduced in school? This
possibility is unlikely for two reasons. First,
multiplication was strongly preferred over subtraction as
an explanation. This pattern is consistent with our claims
about conceptual structure but conflicts with this
alternative account, since subtraction is typically learned
before multiplication. Second, we doubt most people have
ever heard (for example) division explained in terms of
addition, exponential, roots, etc., so differences across
these explanations must be due to a chaining mechanism
of the type we proposed.
Might analogous results hold beyond arithmetic
explanations? Indeed, people have a rich intuitive
understanding of other mathematical domains such as
geometry (Dillon, Huang, & Spelke, 2013), suggesting
that people have intuitive theories of Platonic regularities
across a variety of domains. Moreover, the proof
construction and evaluation principles may be the same
used in more general deductive reasoning processes (Rips,
1994; but see Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 1991), in which
case our method may generalize. Our studies focused on
simple arithmetic operations (e.g., Ashcraft, 1992), but
future work could extend this inquiry to other areas of
mathematics (such as geometry), populations (such as
children or expert mathematicians), or domains (such as
dependencies among physics concepts or among mental
states) to further map our intuitive theories.
The ontological implications of this work are within the
domain of philosophy. For now, we merely contrast two
possible views. According to the dominant Platonist view
(e.g., Frege, 1974/1884), mathematical truths are ‘out
there’ in the world. On the Platonist view, our results
reflect aspects of mathematical structure that have been
internalized from the world. However, others with
Kantian views argue that mathematical cognition reflects
structure imposed on the world by our minds rather than
anything intrinsic in the world (Kant, 1998/1781; Mill,
2002/1843; see Lakoff & Núñez, 2000). On the Kantian
view, our results reflect the intrinsic structure of our
minds themselves, which we impose on the world.
As for the instructional implications of these findings,
we believe mathematics educators are best-positioned to

Note. These coefficients represent the explanatory ‘cost’ of a
given rule appearing in the proof of the explanation. Error bars
represent 95% confidence intervals, calculated over participants.

Mirroring the group-level findings, Figure 2 reveals
higher costs for reverse rules than for forward rules,
leading to more negative regression coefficients for the
reverse rules. This was true for rules 1F and 1R (95% CI
[0.28, 1.15] for the difference in regression coefficients),
rules 3F and 3R (95% CI [0.13, 0.81]), rules 4F and 4R
(95% CI [-0.02, 0.58]; marginally significant), and rules
5F and 5R (95% CI [0.17, 0.85]). This difference was not
significant for the addition/multiplication rules 2F and 2R
(95% CI [-0.41, 0.39]), perhaps because repeated addition
of the same addends is uncommon except in the context
of multiplication. Overall, these findings are consistent
with the best-fitting value of the R/F parameter of 1.18 in
the group-level analysis, indicating a higher explanatory
cost for reverse rules than for forward rules.

Discussion
Mathematical knowledge is critical for explaining patterns
in both the physical and symbolic worlds, and for building
an understanding conceptually dependent mathematical
facts. Here, we proposed that people evaluate
mathematical explanations (e.g., “9–3–3=3 because
3+3+3=9”) by building a proof from the explanatory base
(“3+3+3=9”) to the explanatory target (“9–3–3=3”) using
a set of transformation rules (e.g., deriving subtraction
from addition). Supporting this idea, participants

615

make the assessment. However, we do make some
tentative suggestions. First, mathematical proof may not
be intrinsically unintuitive—it may instead be the level of
abstraction of many proofs that masks intuitive
understanding. If so, introducing simple deductive proofs
of simple arithmetic relationships at an earlier educational
stage could lay an intuitive foundation for more formal
proofs later on (see Carpenter, Franke, & Levi, 2003).
Second, people use the conceptual structure of
mathematics to understand derivative concepts in terms of
more basic ones. Educators may wish to emphasize these
abstract connections, in conjunction with more concrete
applications, in order to tap into this intuitive
understanding; for example, explaining division both as a
way to divide resources and as the inverse of
multiplication. Finally, our methodology might be used to
assess the explanatory trade-offs between different kinds
of examples. Studying explanatory preferences in adults
may provide a simple laboratory for testing out
explanatory methods that might be used in educational
settings, prior to undertaking expensive and risky
intervention studies. This method could be used not only
to illuminate mathematical understanding, but also the
conceptual structure of other domains.
