Abstract
Current causal theories aim to incorporate the effect of
statistical and prescriptive norms on causal judgements, stating
that norm-violating actions are judged as more causal than
norm-conforming ones. In this paper, we present two
experiments that undermine this claim, showing that people
attribute increased causality to agents who conform to the norm
of frequent behaviour. Furthermore, we find that the time point
at which a moral norm is introduced does not make a difference
to causal attributions, but that the frequency of a norm violation
further accentuates its causal rating. Because these findings
present a challenge to current norm theories of causation, we
argue for an extended counterfactual model of causal
attribution.

Introduction
Judgements about causal processes are a crucial skill to make
sense of the word. While our ordinary concept of causation
was long thought to be entirely objective in character, we
know that factors that go beyond the causal facts of a
situation, e.g. the moral status of an action, are hugely
influential on how we think about the causality of an agent
(Halpern & Hitchcock, 2015; Hitchcock & Knobe, 2009,
Alicke, Rose & Blome, 2011). For example, if two agents
cause a negative outcome by jointly performing the same
action, but only one of them is actually allowed to perform
this action, people judge the agent who violated the rule as
more of a cause (Knobe & Fraser, 2008). A similar picture
arises for the statistical properties of an action. Exceptional
or atypical actions (Kahneman & Miller, 1986), as well as
actions with statistically unlikely outcomes (Kominsky et al.,
2015) are judged more causal than typical actions or likely
outcomes.
All these cases involve circumstances in which the factor
that is viewed as a cause is ‘abnormal’: a person does
something immoral, a person does something she usually
does not do, or an action has a very unlikely outcome. It has
therefore been suggested that our causal judgements are
sensitive to ‘normality’, or ‘norms’, with the term norms
encompassing a variety of norms like moral norms, social
rules or statistical norms such frequent behaviour or the
likelihood of an outcome. This view holds that normviolating actions, i.e. actions that deviate from norms or
normal circumstances, are judged as more causal than normconforming ones (Hart & Honoré, 1963; Hitchcock & Knobe,
2009). The underlying assumption is that we assess a causal
candidate in terms of its counterfactual relation for the

outcome (Gerstenberg & Lagnado, 2010; Halpern & Pearl,
2010) and that norms come into play concerning which
counterfactuals we consider. Hence, when reasoning about
the cause of an event, norms are thought to make normconforming counterfactuals more relevant (Hitchcock &
Knobe, 2009), more available (Kahneman & Miller, 1986),
more probable to be sampled (Icard & Knobe, 2016) or to be
ranked highest in the order of possible counterfactuals
(Halpern & Hitchcock, 2015).
Common to all these accounts is the idea that in a causal
scenario with multiple causal candidates, we will single out
the action or event that is norm-deviant, e.g. immoral or
unlikely, because we have the tendency to counterfactually
simulate an alternative scenario in which normality is in place
and no norm is violated (Hitchcock & Knobe, 2009;
Kahneman & Miller, 1986). In addition, it has been shown
that the norm violation of one agent not only increases causal
attribution, it can also reduce causal attribution to other, norm
conforming agents, known as “causal superseding”
(Kominsky et al., 2015). Although this account applies to
normality and norms in a very broad sense, studies in causal
attribution have mainly investigated the influence of
violations of moral norms (Alicke, Rose & Blome, 2011
Hitchcock & Knobe, 2009; Knobe & Fraser, 2008),
statistical norms (Kahneman & Miller, 1986; Kominsky et
al., 2015) and norms of proper functioning (Hitchcock &
Knobe, 2009). We will subsume these theories under a
general norm-framework of causal judgement.
In the causal cognition literature, frequent, repeated actions
have often been considered as belonging to a special kind of
statistical norms, so called ‘agent-level’ statistical norms or
norms of ‘typical behaviour’. According to the norm
framework of causal judgement, actions that deviate from this
norm, i.e. atypical actions that are rarely or almost never
performed, are seen as more causal than actions that are
performed frequently (Knobe & Fraser, 2008). However,
Sytsma and colleagues showed that these ‘atypical’, i.e.
infrequent actions receive reduced instead of increased causal
attribution (Roxborough & Cumby 2014; Sytsma et al.,
2012). The authors systematically varied the frequency and
morality of actions in the ‘pen case’ scenario (Knobe &
Fraser, 2008). In this scenario, both a professor and an
administrative assistant each take one of two available pens
in the department office, with negative consequences. Sytsma
et al. varied whether each agent frequently took pens from the
office, and whether they were officially allowed to do so.
While, as expected, they found that an agent was judged as
more causal when violating the department policy, they also

2420

found that an agent was attributed more causality when he
frequently took pens rather than only once. This was even the
case when there was no department policy prohibiting the use
of pens (Sytsma et al., 2012).
By showing that an action that has been repeatedly
performed previously receives higher rather than lower
causal ratings, the authors provide evidence that agent-level
frequent behaviour does not always follow the general
schema attributed to the role of norms in causal reasoning.
However, the influence of frequent behaviour on causal
judgements in this particular case might not come as a
surprise. The causal structure of the “pen case” scenario is
sensitive towards the frequency of the actions – trivially, the
more often a person takes pens, the more they contribute to
the pens running out. This raises the question whether the
frequency of a particular action, or non-action, also
influences our judgement of its causal contribution in a causal
structure where the frequency itself does not make a
difference to the outcome. The causal situation in the pen case
is cumulative: The more often the action is performed, the
more likely the final outcome is to happen. However, let’s
imagine a case where at the end of each day the pen stock
gets replenished to two pens. If only one of the agents
repeatedly takes a pen on each day, then no problem occurs.
But when both agents decide to take a pen on the same day,
then there will be no pens left for emergency cases. This case
represents a conjunctive causal structure – two actions are
needed for the adverse outcome to occur. We were interested
whether the frequency of an action still has an impact on our
causal judgements in such a scenario:
1.

Does the frequency of an action affect causal
judgments in a conjunctive causal structure?

a habitual action before, e.g. when the door knob at home
runs clockwise. In fact, we can think of situations in which
an action that has been frequently done before is suddenly not
allowed anymore, for example smoking in bars after the UK
smoking ban in 2007. This raises the question whether a
norm-violating act that has been permissively performed
before is judged less causal than a repeated norm violation:
3.

How does a frequent norm violation compare to an
action that has been done frequently, but violated a
norm only once?

The two experiments in this paper aim to address these
questions.

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 examined the influence of the “frequency”
and “morality” of an action on causal judgments in a
conjunctive causal structure. Frequent and moral behavior
were varied across the actions of one agent (‘Agent 1’) and
held constant across actions of the other agent (‘Agent 2’). In
order to manipulate frequent behavior realistically, we used
the time frame of a week in which information about the
action of the agents is successively presented day by day.
Additionally, we varied whether the official norm indicating
which agent is allowed to perform the respective action is
either introduced right at the beginning of the scenario, or just
before the final outcome (“time point of moral norm”). By
varying the time point at which the moral norm was
introduced we could test actions that either frequently violate
a norm, or violate the norm for the first time but have been
frequently performed before.

Methods
Norm-incorporating theories predict increased causal
attribution to actions that violate moral norms, but make no
prediction as to whether the frequency of the norm violation
further accentuates its causal relevance. In terms of
counterfactual dependence, if the joint actions of a frequent
and a one-off moral norm violator lead to a negative outcome
in a conjunctive causal structure, they are both equally causal
– if either of them had not acted, the outcome would not have
occurred (Halpern & Pearl, 2010). Furthermore, they are both
also ‘equally abnormal’, because both of them violated the
norm in the situation of the final outcome. Current norm
incorporating theories leave open whether we mentally undo
only the final vs. all previous norm-violating actions in order
to assess the causal relevance of a norm-violating agent. This
motivated our second research question:
2.

Is a frequent vs. one-off norm violation assigned a
different amount of causality in a conjunctive causal
structure?

Gershman et al. (2016) show that if a certain action leads
to a negative outcome in a new context, e.g. the door at the
new office breaks when you turn the doorknob clockwise,
this action will be judged less blameworthy when it has been

Participants 103 participants were recruited via Amazon
Mechanical Turk ($0.80 for ca. 15 min). Participants who
answered more than four of the 32 manipulation check
questions wrong were removed from the analysis, leaving 81
participants (male = 45, female = 36; mean age=34.78;
SD=11.36, age range = 19-74).
Materials All conditions used variations of the same
vignette. The scenario describes a week in a startup company,
from Monday to Monday, with office days from Monday to
Thursday. The company printer breaks as soon as it receives
two printing orders at the same time [conjunctive causal
structure with two actions], while individual printing does not
make a causal difference. The participant acts as CEO with
two co-workers, Agent 1 and Agent 2, whose names and
gender are counterbalanced across scenarios.
Together with two former classmates from university, Agent 1 and Agent 2,
you have founded a small startup company of which you are the CEO. You
are in charge of the management and finances, while Agent 1 and Agent 2
manage the creative direction part. Your team works from Mondays to
Thursdays. The printer in your office works fine, only when it receives two
printing orders at the same time it crashes.

2421

Agent 1 either uses the printer frequently during the week
(“frequent behaviour”), or never prints during the week
(“infrequent behaviour”). Furthermore, there is a company
policy that determines that Agent 1 and Agent 2 are either
allowed to use the printer anytime they want, or only on
selected days.

have just read, did Agent X typically use the printer?”) with
the answer options (‘yes’, ‘no’) were given.

As the CEO of your startup, you officially rule that both Agent 1 and Agent 2
are allowed to use the printer whenever they want [Agent 1 is only allowed
to print on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Agent 2 only on Mondays and
Wednesdays.]

By printing on e.g. a Monday, Agent 1 conforms to the
company policy in case of the liberal printer policy (“moral
norm conformation”) or violates the company policy in case
of the selective policy (“moral norm violation”). Combined
with the frequency manipulation, Agent 1 therefore conforms
to or violates the policy, and does so frequently or
infrequently. In contrast, Agent 2 prints frequently during the
week, and always only on the days on which she is allowed
to print. Each day of the week is successively presented.
On Monday, X uses the printer for printing the new flyer design.
On Tuesday, X uses the printer for printing the program outline.
On Wednesday, X uses the printer for the printing of the new logo.
On Thursday, X uses the printer for printing out the schedule.

After the presentation of one week, i.e. the Monday after the
start of the scenario, both agents simultaneously send printing
orders to the printer and it crashes.
On the following Monday, you come into the office and the printer is broken.
Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 have sent printing orders to the office printer
today. This is bad because your start up currently does not have the budget
to afford a new high quality colour printer.

The company policy is either introduced at the beginning of
the scenario, as shown in the previous examples, or on
Thursday, i.e. just before the final outcome (“time point of
moral norm”)

Figure 1. Experimental design with the norm introduced on
beginning of the scenario (above) and on Thursday, i.e. at the end of
the scenario (below).

Design and Procedure The experiment was designed as 2
(Frequency) ×2 (Moral Norm) x 2 (Time point of moral
norm) within subject paradigm. Participants saw all eight
variations of the scenario in a randomized order, and each
office day was presented successively on a single slide. The
participants then had to judge the causal contribution of both
agents to the outcome on a 10-point causal rating scale (“To
what extent did Agent X cause the outcome?”: 0”- ‘None at
all’; “10”- ‘Fully). Recent studies have highlighted that the
term ‘cause’ in the test questions is ambiguous and can refer
to both the causal mechanism and the agent’s accountability
(Samland et al., 2015). Therefore, we added a 7-point
counterfactual relevance agreement scale (“If Agent X had
not printed, the problem would not have occurred.”; “1” ‘Strongly disagree’; “7” - ‘Strongly agree’) to directly test
counterfactual reasoning. In addition, four manipulations
check questions about the moral norm (“In the scenario you
have just read, was Agent X allowed to print on Monday?”)
and the frequency of the agents’ actions (“In the scenario you

when Agent 1 acted only once, they were judged as less

Counterfactual Relevance | Agent 1 The agreement ratings
for the counterfactual relevance of Agent 1 were affected by
both Agent 1’s moral behaviour, F(1, 80) = 21.60, p < .001,
𝛈𝟐𝒑 = .21, and frequency of action, F(1, 80) = 17.86, p < .001,
𝛈𝟐𝒑 =.18. The agreement for Agent 1 as relevant
counterfactual was higher when they violated a moral norm
(M=5.20, SD=1.47) than when they did not (M=4.75,
SD=1.44) and lower when they acted one-off (M=4.69,
SE=1.63) compared to when they acted frequently (M=5.26,
SD=1.32).

Discussion

Counterfactual Relevance | Agent 2 The violation of
morality by Agent 1 decreased agreement with Agent 2 as
counterfactually relevant (MD=-.45; SD=0.13), F(1, 80) =
12.67, p < .001, ηp2 = .14. Agent 2 was also seen less
counterfactually relevant when Agent 1 acted frequently
(MD=-.32; SD=0.13), F(1, 80) = 12.67, p=.006, 𝛈𝟐𝒑 = .14
Moral Norm Violation A 2 (Frequency) × 2 (Time point of
moral norm) ANOVA for norm violating actions revealed a
significant difference for the frequent norm violation
(M=7.09, SD=1.24), vs. infrequent norm violation (M=5.62,
SD=1.36) of Agent 1 on causal judgements, F(1, 80) = 24.60,
p < .001, η2𝑝 = .24. A corresponding reverse rating was found
for Agent 2 when Agent 1 violated the moral norm frequently
(M=3.24, SD=1.25) vs. once (M=3.99, SD=1.33), F(1, 80) =
8.43, p = .005, η2𝑝 = .09. Counterfactual relevance ratings for
Agent 1 were higher when Agent 1 frequently violated the
norm (M=5.49, SD=.15) vs. once once (M=4.92, SD=.20),
F(1, 80) = 16.17, p < .001, η2𝑝 = .17. Agent 2 was seen less
counterfactually relevant when Agent 1 frequently violates
the norm, compared to violating the norm once (MD=-.47,
SD=.18), F(1, 80) = 7.23, p = .009, η2𝑝 = .08.

Experiment 1 confirmed the effect of moral norms on
causal attribution (Knobe & Fraser, 2008), showing that an
agent who violates a moral norm is judged as more causal and
counterfactually relevant than a norm-conforming agent. We
also found a reversed norm influence for agent-level
statistical norms, with frequent behaviour being judged more
instead of less causal than one-off actions. We found the same
effects for counterfactual relevance ratings, showing that
moral norm violations and frequent behaviour increase the
extent to which an action is seen as counterfactually relevant
to the outcome. An increase in causal attribution to Agent 1
due to norm violating and/or frequent behaviour was
accompanied by a decrease in causal attribution to Agent 2,
known as “causal superseding” (Kominsky et al., 2015). We
did not find an interaction between the immoral norm
behaviour and the time point at which the norm was
introduced in the scenario. Hence, an action that has been
violating the norm from the beginning is judged as causal as
an action that has been frequently performed before, but only
violated a norm after the new introduction of a moral norm.
Our finding that frequent behaviour increased causal
attribution is consistent with Sytsma et al. (2012), but was
surprising insofar as the causal structure of our scenario was
designed to be causally insensitive to an individual action that
occurs frequently, i.e. using the printer often. However, it
might be argued that the influence of frequent vs. one-off
actions in a conjunctive causal structure depends on the
knowledge that both agents have about each other’s
behaviour. For example, when the agent who usually never
uses the printer suddenly prints in a conjunctive causal
structure, she might be seen as more causally responsible for
the outcome if she is aware that the other agent frequently

prints. In addition, despite our attempt to implement a
conjunctive causal structure, participants might have
interpreted frequent behaviour in our scenario as gradually
damaging the printer. In order to further investigate the role
of knowledge, and accentuate the difference between a
cumulative and conjunctive causal structure, we conducted a
second experiment.

Results

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 examined the influence of frequent behavior in
dependence of the underlying causal structure and state of
knowledge of the agents.

Methods
Participants 102 participants were recruited via Amazon
Mechanical Turk ($0.80 for ca. 15 min), and after removing
participants who had more than four of the 32 check
questions wrong, the data of 64 participants were analyzed
(male = 34, female = 30; mean age=33.56; SD=11.92, age
range = 21-74).
Materials The same design as in Experiment 1 was used,
except that the moral norm manipulation was removed by
setting the moral status of all actions to “moral norm
conforming” by a company policy that allowed the two
agents to use the printer anytime. The frequency of the
actions of Agent 1 was varied while holding the frequency of
Agent 2 constant. Hence, either both of them frequently used
the printer on different days during the week, or only Agent
2 used the printer. The underlying causal structure of the
scenario was also varied by either containing a conjunctive
causal structure (Experiment 1), or a cumulative causal
structure, i.e. every action gradually increases the likelihood
for the outcome to happen

Causal Rating | Agent 1 Causal ratings for Agent 1 were
generally higher when they acted frequently (M=5.31;
SD=1.30 than when they acted one-off (M=2.90; SD=1.89),
F(1, 63) = 103.78, p < .001, η2𝑝 = .62. However, the increase
in causal contribution when Agent 1 used the printer
frequently was greater in the cumulative causal structure than
in the conjunctive causal structure, F(1, 63) = 103.78, p=.001,
η2𝑝 = .16 . No significant effect for knowledge was found
(p=.48).
Causal Rating | Agent 2 Agent 2 was seen as less causal
when Agent 1 acted frequently, (M=5.32, SD=1.30), but
more causal when Agent 1 performed a one-off action
(M=6.93, SD=1.90), F(1, 63) = 69.15, p < .001, η2𝑝 = .52. The
increase in causal attribution to Agent 2 when Agent 1 did
not act frequently was greater in the cumulative than in the
conjunctive causal structure, F(1, 63) = 39.64, p < .001, η2𝑝 =
.37. There was no significant effect for knowledge (p=.90).

Discussion
Experiment 2 confirmed the effect of frequent behavior on
causal judgments. Frequent behavior was seen as more causal
than one-off behavior, independent of the underlying causal
structure. However, participants were aware that the change
from frequent behaviour to a one-off action led to a greater
reduction in causal contribution in the cumulative causal
structure than in a conjunctive structure. The effect of
frequent behaviour was independent of whether or not the
agents knew about each other’s behavior.

General Discussion
Our two experiments found evidence for an increase in the
causal attribution to an agent who acts in line with their
frequent behaviour, even when the frequency of this behavior
does not make a causal difference to the outcome. Our results
present a challenge to the norm account of causal judgment,
showing that a one-off action that deviates from frequent
behavior is judged less instead of more causal for a negative
outcome. Since the knowledge about the other agent’s
behavior did not make a difference to causal judgements,
despite being crucial for estimating the outcome in a
conjunctive causal structure, we rule out that people might
have inferred bad intentions or foreseeability of the outcome
from typical behavior (Lagnado & Channon, 2008). Hence,
we believe that the fact that people assign increased causality
to a frequent, typical action goes against predictions of norm
theories and shows the need for a new account of frequency
of actions in causal attribution. Current counterfactual and
structural equation models (Halpern & Pearl, 2005; Chockler
& Halpern, 2014) fail to account for the asymmetry of causal
attribution between a frequent vs. one-off actor in a
conjunctive causal structure, given that previous behavior
does not change the counterfactual dependency of the two
actions in the actual situation.
We draw two conclusions from this. First, we argue for the
need to include the previous history of actions of an agent

into counterfactual accounts of causal judgments. Second, we
argue that an extension of current counterfactual theories is
needed in order to capture the influence of frequency. One
such extension could be probabilistic (Fenton-Glynn, 2016).
While frequent behavior does not differ from one-off
behavior in terms of single counterfactual dependencies, it
does so probabilistically. If, in a counterfactual world, the
other agent acts at a random time point in a conjunctive
structure, the outcome is more likely to occur if I frequently
perform the other action needed for the outcome. In contrast,
it is less likely to occur if I act infrequently. The raised
probability of the outcome due to my frequent behavior can
even increase when we also vary whether the other agent acts
frequently vs. one-off. As a result, we argue that in addition
to counterfactually testing whether the undoing of an action
makes a difference, we also need to test whether the variation
of the frequency of the action would make difference to the
likelihood of the outcome to occur.
Our results show that a frequent norm violation is judged
more causal than a one-off moral norm violation. This is
despite the fact that in the actual situation of the outcome,
they are both equally counterfactually relevant, as well as
equally. Hence, we think that current norm theories need to
include the frequency of previous norm violations in order to
fully capture the influence of moral norms on causal
attributions. However, the time point at which the moral norm
is introduced into the scenario does not change the way we
assign causality to actions that violate this norm. To
conclude, the influence of the frequency of an action proves
to be a crucial factor in the attribution of causality, and calls
for new theoretical frameworks of causation. We argue that
this framework has to be probabilistic.
