Abstract
The study of the coordination of attention, a term called joint
attention (JA), has resulted in a better understanding of the
dynamics and development of communication. Despite the
important insights gained from studying JA, there is little
consensus regarding the specific components that are included in
operationalizing JA. The present work explored a parameter space
of JA during a dyadic naturalistic toy play task between 9-monthold infants and their parents. We systematically measured the
temporal properties of two components commonly used to
operationalize JA: the duration of continuous alignment of parent
and infant visual fixations and the flexibility of fluctuations of
attention. The results show that very brief bouts of JA are
important predictors for vocabulary development. The results from
this work provide new insights into the specific properties used to
operationalize JA and point to the importance of considering
multiple timescales of behavior that make up JA.

Introduction
Human interaction consists of behaviors that occur across
multiple timescales. When an infant interacts with a parent,
physiological rhythms are coordinated within a 1s timescale
(Feldman, Margoi-Cohen, Galli, Singer, & Louzoun, 2011),
vocalizations at a 3s timescale (van Egeren, Barratt, &
Roach, 2001; Harder et al., 2015), and leader-follower
dynamics of vocalizations fluctuate across a 10s-temporal
window (Abney, Warlaumont, Oller, Wallot, & Kello,
2016). Infants and their parents also coordinate their
attention onto objects, a coordinative behavior called joint
attention. The achievement of joint attention emerges early
in the first year of life (Scaife & Bruner, 1975), and has
been shown to be a fundamental component of
communicative skills ranging from the development of
language to social competencies (Mundy & Newell, 2007).
The main goal of the current paper is to determine the
relevant timescales for joint attention during infancy.
The empirical study of joint attention was initiated by the
seminal work of Scaife and Bruner (1975) observing that
infants could follow the direction of a partner’s gaze within
the first year, and that this behavior increased in frequency
with age. Since Scaife and Bruner’s original findings,
decades of research have led to important theoretical and
empirical contributions to areas of psychology ranging from

Although the overall consensus is that joint attention is an
important ability, there is less agreement and consistency
regarding how joint attention is defined and operationalized.
For example, in Scaife and Bruner’s (1975) original work, a
positive joint attention behavior was coded if an infant (a)
looked in the same direction as the experimenter without (b)
intervening looks elsewhere within (c) 7s of the
experimenter’s look. In another example, Bakeman and
Adamson (1984) coded behavior as a coordinated joint
engagement state if the infant (a) actively coordinates his or
her attention with another person and an object for (b) a
particular duration with (c) only brief attention shifts to
other objects for less than 3s. Finally, Tomasello and
colleagues (Tomasello & Todd, 1983; Tomasello & Farrar,
1986) defined joint attention as when (a) infant and parent
both visually attended to the same object for (b) at least 3s
with (c) only brief looks elsewhere. Table 1 provides an
abbreviated review of the timescales used to operationalize

1489

joint attention for studies focused on the relationship
between joint attention and language.
In free-flowing parent-infant everyday interaction, joint
attention is embedded in a stream of free-flowing activity in
which parents both react to and attempt to control toddlers’
behaviors and in which toddlers react to, direct, and
sometimes ignore parents as they pursue their own goals. In
those naturalistic contexts, we know that adults generate on
average 3 eye fixations per second (Hayhoe, Shrivastava,
Mruczek, & Pelz, 2003) and we also know, from our recent
head-mounted eye tracking studies, infants generate lots of
short looks in toy play (Yu & Smith, 2016). That means the
exquisite real-time “dance” of social interactions require
effective adjustments within the dyad and socially
coordinated shifts in attention have to be resolved in
fractions of a second. In this context, it is possible that joint
attention spans multiple timescales, displaying important
variability at short timescales and also at longer timescales.
The specific goal of the current paper is to investigate the
relevance of two key parameters used to operationalize joint
attention that have varied considerably across research
groups: the duration of continuous alignment of parent and
infant visual fixations and the flexibility of fluctuations of
attention. We refer to the former parameter as minimum
joint duration and the later parameter as minimum duration.
For minimum joint duration, we varied the duration to
estimate joint attention across micro-level (e.g., 500ms) and
macro-level (e.g., 10s) timescales. We focused on two
aspects of this manipulation. First, we investigated how
properties of joint attention, like mean duration, frequency,
and proportion, varied across the minimum joint attention
dimension. Importantly, we were also interested in how
minimum joint duration affected how many dyads in our
sample exhibited joint attention at a particular timescale. For
example, it is possible that some infant-parent dyads do not
exhibit any macro-level joint attention bouts, which would
require us to omit them from subsequent analyses. For
minimum duration, we first kept the parameter fixed at 0ms
to simulate coding schemes that only identified a JA bout as
continuous visual alignment on a target object with no looks
elsewhere (Study 1) and then manipulated the parameter to
allow for brief fluctuations of attention less than 300ms
(Study 2).
Second, we asked how different values of minimum joint
duration impacted the predictive value of joint attention.
Previous research has observed that joint attention correlates
with concurrent – and predicts future – vocabulary size
(Baldwin, 1995; Tomasello & Farrar, 1986; Tomasello &
Todd, 1983; Smith et al., 1988; Carpenter et al., 1998;
Morales et al., 2000; Mundy, Sigman, & Kasari, 1990).
Therefore, to determine how minimum joint duration affects
the predictive value of joint attention for vocabulary size, in
Study 3, we estimated joint attention for different values
along the minimum joint duration dimension for 9-month
infants and their parents, and tested whether joint attention
across various timescales predicted future vocabulary size.

Methods
Participants
26 parent-infant dyads participated (15 female and 11 male).
The mean age of infants was 9.21 months (SD=0.23). Parent
reports of vocabulary were collected three and six months
later when the infants were 12 months and 15 months.

Stimuli
Six toys (car, cup, and train; duck, plane, and boat),
organized into two sets of three were used. Each toy in the
two sets had a unique uniform color (red, blue, green).

Stimuli
Parents and their infants sat across from each other at a table
(61cm x 91cm x 64cm). The infants sat in a custom highchair and the parents sat on the floor. Both infants and
parents wore head-mounted eye trackers (positive science,
LLC). The head-mounted eye-tracking system includes two
cameras: (1) An infrared camera that is placed just below
and is pointed to the right eye that records eye images, and
(2) A scene camera that is placed low on the forehead and is
pointed outwards captures the user’s first-person view (90°
visual field). Each eye tracking system recorded egocentricview video and gaze direction (x-, y-coordinates) in that
view, sampled at 30Hz. Another camera (30Hz) was
mounted above the table and provided a bird’s eye view of
the dyadic interaction (see Yu & Smith (2013) for additional
technical details).

Procedure
Parents and infants were fitted with the eye-tracking gear
(see Figure 1). Once the eye-tracking gear was securely
affixed to the participants, a calibration phase was
completed. To collect calibration points for each eyetracker, an experimenter directed the infant’s attention
toward a toy that was only used for calibration while
another experimenter recorded the moment the child
attended to the location of the toy. This procedure was
repeated 15 times with the calibration toy played in various
locations on the tabletop. A similar procedure was used to
calibrate the parent’s eye tracker. The calibration procedure
took approximately five minutes.
Once the calibration phase was complete, an experimenter
placed one of the object sets on the table and the first play
trial began. During object play, parents were instructed to
engage with their infant as they naturally would. After
approximately 60 seconds of play, an experimenter swapped
out the objects with the second set of objects, and the
second trial began. This procedure was repeated and dyads
completed up to four trials for a total of six minutes of play.
Not all dyads completed the full play session. Twenty-four
dyads completed all four trials and two dyads completed
three trials, for a total average playtime of five minutes,
eight seconds.

elsewhere. In other words, all joint attention bouts estimated
for this study only included simultaneous and continuous
fixations from infant and parent. For example, in Figure 2,
Bout 1 (blue object) would not be considered a JA bout
because there is a brief look from the parent to the infant’s
face (pink). Bout 2 (red object) would be considered a JA
bout because (1) the infant’s and parent’s fixations were on
the same object (red object) for longer than a particular
duration set in our parameter exploration and (2) the
fixations were continuous with no brief fixations elsewhere.
In Study 2, we manipulated the minimum duration
parameter to equal either 0ms or 300ms. To return back to
the example in Figure 2, when minimum duration equals
300ms, Bout 1 (blue object) would now be considered a JA
bout because the brief look from the parent to the infant’s
face (pink) is shorter in duration than 300ms.

Data Processing

Exploration of Joint Attention Parameter Space
To explore the parameter space of minimum joint duration,
we created six different temporal durations for minimum
joint duration (500ms, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, and 10s). The other
parameter we manipulated was minimum duration, and
varied this parameter as either 0ms or 300ms. In Study 1, we
fixed the minimum duration parameter to 0ms, and explored
the minimum joint duration parameter across all six
duration. In Study 2, we explored a combination of a subset
of the minimum joint duration parameter (500ms and 1s)
and the minimum duration parameter (0ms and 300ms).

Eye-tracking software yielded scene camera footage with
crosshairs superimposed, this footage was then sampled at a
rate of 30 frames per second. Using an in-house coding
program, trained coders annotated frame-by-frame the target
of gaze. Three regions of interest (ROIs) were defined for
the three objects. ROIs were manually coded frame-byframe from a first-person view video. An ROI was
annotated when a cross-hair overlapped on any portion of an
object or face. To assess reliability, a second coder coded a
randomly-selected 10% of the frames with 95% agreement.

Properties of Joint Attention Bouts

Figure 2: Operationalizing joint attention bouts using
minimum duration and minimum joint duration.

Joint Attention Parameters
Two parameters were used to determine joint attention:
minimum joint duration and minimum duration (see Figure
2). Minimum joint duration is the temporal duration of
continuous alignment of parent and infant fixations on a
particular object ROI. Minimum duration is the temporal
duration of brief looks elsewhere other than the joint
attention ROI, e.g., another object, partner’s face. Previous
research has incorporated this component into various
coding schemes, sometimes allowing for brief looks
elsewhere, and for other coding schemes, not allowing the
flexibility of brief looks. For Study 1, we keep this
parameter fixed at 0ms to not allow for brief looks

In Study 1, we estimated joint attention bouts across the
minimum joint duration parameter space for each of the 26
infant-parent dyads. Thus, for each dyad, we had 6 joint
attention streams. In Study 2, we estimated joint attention
bouts across the limited minimum joint duration parameter
and the minimum duration parameter, equating to 4 joint
attention streams across the parameter space combinations.
For each joint attention bout stream, we estimated three
properties: proportion (% of time in joint attention),
frequency (rate/min), and average bout duration. To
determine how many dyads with at least one joint attention
bout in each parameter space value, we calculated a
parameter-level measure as the percentage of the sample (26
dyads) that yielded at least one joint attention bout in a
particular parameter value. In Study 3, we explored how
joint attention proportion estimates across the minimum
joint duration parameter space at 9-months of age predicted
vocabulary size at 12 and 15 months of age.

Vocabulary Size
Infants and parents returned to the laboratory at ages 12and 15-month to complete the MacArthur-Bates
Communicative Development Inventory (Fenson et al.,
1994). We used total receptive vocabulary as our measure of
vocabulary scores at each age.

Study 1

duration (β=-.0001, SE= 0.00002, p<.001), suggesting that
as minimum joint durations increased, proportion decreased.
When increasing the minimum joint duration parameter
from 500ms (Mproportion=.16, SEproportion=.02) to 3000ms
(Mproportion=.07, SEproportion=.01), we observed a 53% decrease
in JA proportion.
Calculating the percentage of dyads with at least one joint
attention bout for a particular parameter space value
provides a metric of how the sample size changes as a
function of parameter value choices. Considering that
investigations of joint attention utilize properties of joint
attention bouts, we interpret this value below 100% for a
particular combination to be suboptimal for the study of
joint attention. Inspection of these estimates yielded some
important observations. Estimates decreased as the duration
of the minimum joint duration parameter increased. At 2s,
the amount of dyads with at least one JA bout dropped
below 100% and at 5s, only approximately 50% of the
sample had at least one joint attention bout. This is an
important observation because it points to a particular
timescale, 2-3s, when the behavior of interest, joint
attention, does not occur for some dyads in a sample.
We have established that after a particular timescale, 2-3s,
the amount of dyads producing at least one bout of joint
attention drops considerably with increases in the minimum
joint duration parameter.

We first investigated the properties of joint attention bouts
across parameter space. We conducted a linear mixedeffects model (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008) to
examine the effects of minimum joint duration on the joint
attention bout properties (proportion, frequency, and
average bout duration). We included dyad membership as a
random slope with the maximally permitted random
intercept. Because only one dyad had at least one joint
attention bout longer than the minimum joint duration
parameter at 10s, we excluded the 10s duration from the
minimum joint duration parameter in subsequent analyses
(see Figure 3).

For joint attention rate, there was a significant effect of
minimum joint duration (β=-.0009, SE= 0.00007, p<.001),
suggesting that as minimum joint durations increased, the
rate of joint attention bouts (per minute) decreased. When
increasing the minimum joint duration parameter from the
shortest duration reflecting the micro-level timescale, 500ms
(Mrate=4.99, SErate=.39), to the frequently-used timescale in
previous literature, 3000ms (Mrate=1.07, SErate=.11) (see
Table 1; Bakeman & Adamson, 1994; Carpenter et al.,
1998; Tomasello & Todd, 1983; Tomasello & Farrar, 1986),
we observed a 78% decrease in JA bout rate.
As expected, for mean joint attention duration, there was
a significant effect of minimum joint duration (β=.001, SE=
0.00003, p<.001), suggesting that as minimum joint
durations increased, the mean duration of joint attention
bouts increased.
Similar to what was observed for rate, for joint attention
proportion, there was a significant effect of minimum joint

To investigate the potential combinatory effects of both
minimum joint duration and minimum duration, we
estimated JA bouts across the minimum duration parameter
(0ms and 300ms) and a subset of the minimum joint
duration parameter dimension (500ms and 1000ms). Our
parameter space therefore consisted of 4 possible
combinations of the two parameters. We chose these
parameters because (1) in Study 1, we observed 100% of the
dyads had at least one JA bout for the 500ms and 1000ms
minimum joint duration values and (2) 300ms as a value for
the minimum duration parameter has been used in previous
research to allow for flexibility in the fluctuations of
attention (Yu & Smith, 2013, 2016).
Consistent with Study 1, for joint attention rate, there was
a significant effect of minimum joint duration (β=-.0004,
SE= 0.00003, p<.001), suggesting that as minimum joint
durations increased, rate of joint attention bouts increased.
There was no significant effect of minimum duration
(β=.0001, SE= 0.0004, p=.76) nor was the interaction
significant (β=.0000001, SE= 0.0000006, p=.78),
suggesting, despite allowing for brief attentional flexibility
(minimum duration=300ms) compared to no flexibility
(minimum duration=0ms), joint attention rate remained the
same (see Figure 5).
Mean joint attention duration increased as minimum joint
duration increased (β=.002, SE= 0.0001, p<.001), but there
was no significant effect of minimum duration (β=-.0002,

1492

SE= 0.0004, p=.75) nor was the interaction significant
(β=.00000003, SE= 0.0000006, p=.56). Mean joint attention
proportion decreased as minimum joint duration increased
(b=-.0005, SE= 0.00004, p<.001), but there was no
significant effect of minimum duration (b=.00005, SE=
0.0001, p=.74) nor was the interaction significant (b=.00000005, SE= 0.0000002, p=.81).

finding because it strengthens the argument that the relevant
timescales for joint attention, and subsequent predictive
value for language development, include durations shorter
than 3 seconds. We will discuss the implications of this
result in the Discussion section.

Study 3
We analyzed the relationship between joint attention
proportion estimates across the minimum joint duration
parameter space at 9-months of age and vocabulary size at
12 and 15 months of age. From the previous analyses, we
know that increases in minimum joint duration lead to
decreases in the amount of joint attention bouts and also the
proportion of joint attention bouts. It is possible that even
though joint attention proportion decreases, the overall
variability still predicts vocabulary size. Alternatively, it is
also possible that decreases in joint attention proportion also
reduces the likelihood that the variability of joint attention
proportion covaries with later vocabulary size. Table 2
shows the correlation results across parameter space values
for joint attention proportion at 9 months and vocabulary
size at 12 and 15 months. As observed in previous analyses,
the amount of dyads with proportion estimates varies across
the parameter space. Therefore, it is important to note the
varying degrees of freedom of the correlations across the
parameter space values.
There are a few important observations from this analysis.
First, the pattern of correlations between joint attention
proportion and vocabulary size does not vary across 12
months to 15 months. This suggests that the predictive value
of joint attention at 9 months extends into the second year of
life. Second, the results suggest that after exceeding a
minimum joint duration of 3s, joint attention is no longer
predictive of language development. This is an important

The present study investigated the relevant timescales for
joint attention in infant-parent naturalistic free-play. To
answer this question, we explored a parameter space
consisting of two frequently used components implemented
to operationalize joint attention: minimum joint duration
and minimum duration. Across three studies, we observed a
collection of important results that provide insight into the
consequences of choosing specific parameters for
operationalizing joint attention. First, the observation of
joint attention behavior drops precipitously when the
duration of continuous alignment of parent and infant visual
fixations (minimum joint duration parameter) extends
longer than ~3s. Second, allowing for brief fluctuations of
attention away from the target object (minimum duration
parameter), does not appear to impact the overall properties
of joint attention. Third, the predictive value of joint
attention for language development reduces in strength
when joint attention bouts shorter than 3s are omitted from
analysis.
Perhaps the most important observation from this study
was that when we only included joint attention bouts
exceeding 3 seconds, the properties of joint attention
changed significantly: rate and proportion of joint attention
bouts were reduced by 50% or more. Furthermore, only
including joint attention bouts exceeding a 3-second
duration resulted in the loss of predictive value of joint
attention for vocabulary size. Taken together, these results
suggest that a purely macro-level approach to the study of
joint attention can lead to a loss of important variability that
captures the phenomenon of joint attention.
We also observed that the inclusion of a parameter that
affords brief fluctuations of attention to parts of the visual
environment other than the target object does not
significantly affect the properties of joint attention. It is

1493

important to point out that we limited this analysis to only a
subset of the minimum joint duration parameter in order to
include all joint attention bouts longer than 500ms and
1000ms. It is possible that the inclusion of macro-level
values of minimum joint attention (e.g., 500ms) and longer
values of minimum duration – extending the duration of
fluctuations of attention – would affect the joint attention
properties beyond nominal differences. We plan to attend to
this question in more detail in subsequent research.
Investigations of joint attention provide unique insights
into the development and dynamics of human
communication. The present study focused on an important
methodological and theoretical question: what are the
relevant timescales for joint attention? Our results,
generated from a deductive technique to explore different
areas of the parameter space of joint attention, suggest that
the inclusion of micro-level temporal specifications of joint
attention (e.g., <3s) is important for capturing a more
vibrant picture of joint attention.
