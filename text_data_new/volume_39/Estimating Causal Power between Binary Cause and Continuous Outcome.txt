causal relations (Hume, 1739/2000). For binary variables,
covariation is represented as patterns of presence and
absence. A measure of contingency is described by ΔP
(Jenkins & Ward, 1965):

Abstract
Previous studies of causal learning heavily focused on binary
outcomes; little is known about causal learning with
continuous outcomes. The present paper proposes a
qualitative extension of the causal power theory to the
situation where a binary cause influences a continuous effect,
and induces causal power under various ceiling situations
with the continuous outcomes. To test the predictions, we
systematically manipulated the type of outcome (continuous
vs. percentage vs. binary) and the contingency information.
The experiment shows that people estimate causal strength
based on the linear-sum rule for continuous outcomes and the
noisy-OR rule for binary outcomes. In the partial ceiling
situation where causal power is partially inferred but not
precisely estimated, the distribution of participants’
judgments was bimodal with one mode at the minimum value
and the other at the maximum value, suggesting some
participants made conservative estimates while others made
optimistic estimates. These results are generally consistent
with the predictions of the causal power theory. Theoretical
implications and future directions are discussed.

ΔP = P(E = 1|C = 1) − P(E = 1|C = 0)

where P(E = 1|C = 1) is the probability of effect E given the
presence of candidate cause C, and P(E = 1|C = 0) is the
probability of E given the absence of C. Values of ΔP range
from −1 to +1. Positive ΔP values indicate a generative
causal relation; negative ΔP values indicate a preventive
causal relation.
Because ΔP is a measure of associative strength, it does
not address issues in causation such as confounding and
ceiling effects. For example, although it is impossible to
judge the causal effect when the outcome always occurs
regardless of the presence or absence of the cause (i.e., P(E
= 1|C = 1) = P(E = 1|C = 0) = 1), the ΔP model indicates
that there is no causal relation (i.e., ΔP = 0). To model
causal strength, Cheng (1997) proposed the power PC
theory and derived generative causal power as an estimate:

Introduction

wc = ΔP / [1 − P(E = 1|C = 0)]

The ability to learn causal relations is essential for
explaining past events, controlling the present environment,
and predicting future outcomes. Decision making based on
causal knowledge enables us to achieve desired outcomes
and to avoid undesired consequences. When there are two
causes of a desired outcome, we should consider which
cause has a high causal strength for producing the outcome.
To estimate causal strength, we need to consider not only
the states of the effect in the presence of the cause but also
that in the absence of the cause (Rescorla, 1968). When a
teacher thinks about the effect of active encouragement on
students’ homework performance, for example, he or she
has to check whether the student finishes the homework
both in the presence and absence of encouragement. It has
been recognized that both children and adults readily form
representations of causal networks (see Holyoak & Cheng,
2011 for a review).
As causal relations are unobservable, they must be
induced from observable events, and covariation among
observable events serves as a fundamental cue to learn

(2)

Causal power wc is a function not only of contingency but
also of the base rates of the effect. When the effect is always
present, generative causal power is undefined, therefore
explaining the (generative) ceiling effect. Buehner, Cheng,
and Clifford (2003) systematically manipulated covariation
information and demonstrated that judgments were well
described by the causal power. Causal power is interpreted
in the framework of causal Bayes nets by Glymour (2001)
and of causal Bayesian models by Tenenbaum & Griffiths
(2001; Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005).
Lu, Rojas, Beckers, and Yuille (2016) proposed a
Bayesian theory of sequential causal learning. Their theory
assumes that people select a different integration rule
according to the type of outcome variable. On one hand, the
noisy-OR rule is appropriate for a binary outcome and is
consistent with Equation (2) in the causal power theory
(Cheng, 1997). The rule assumes that two causes influence
an outcome independently. It states that the effectiveness of
two causes, both present, is the sum of the causal power of
1

each minus their product (i.e., P(E = 1|A = 1, B = 1) = wA +
wB − wA × wB). On the other hand, the linear-sum rule is
appropriate for a continuous outcome and is widely used in
associative learning models such as the R-W model
(Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). This rule simply calculates the
sum of the influence of each cause (i.e., P(E = 1|A = 1, B =
1) = wA + wB ). Lu et al. (2016) presented a sequential
Bayesian model that explains previous findings on outcomeadditivity in variations of the blocking paradigm.
Several empirical studies have provided supporting
evidence for the use of the linear-sum rule for a continuous
outcome. Rashid and Buehner (2013) systematically
manipulated the quantity of continuous outcomes and tested
which integration rules people use. The results appear
inconsistent in that participants use the linear-sum rule for a
generative cause and noisy-OR rule for a preventive cause.
They suggested that the use of the linear-sum rule might be
due to the absence of an upper limit for the quantity of the
continuous outcome in their cover story. Prevention has a
natural lower limit, the outcome quantity equal to 0, sharing
that property with binary outcomes. Saito (2015)
manipulated means and standard deviations in causal
learning with continuous outcomes and found that
judgments are largely explained by difference in the means,
but not by difference in the standard deviations. White
(2015) examined causal judgments of interventions in
temporal sequences of a continuous outcome variable in
single individuals and reported that most of the results were
explained by the difference between the mean outcome
value for the pre-intervention time periods and that for the
post-intervention time periods. These results suggest that
people use the linear-sum rule for continuous outcomes.
However, these studies do not reveal whether people use a
different integration rule depending on the type of outcome
variable since they did not compare judgments for
continuous outcomes with those for the binary outcomes. In
addition, it remains unknown how people estimate causal
strength under various ceiling situation with the continuous
outcomes. Since integration rules are core parts of the
models of causal learning, it is important to investigate how
people choose an integration rule.
In this paper, we extend the causal power theory
qualitatively to address continuous outcomes and derive
predictions under various ceiling effects. For our purposes,
we treat cardinal outcomes as a special case of continuous
outcomes. We also report a study investigating whether
people choose the appropriate integration rules according to
the type of outcome variables and whether their judgments
correspond to causal-power predictions.

(1) B and C influence E independently,
(2) B could increase E but not reduce it,
(3) The causal powers of B and C are independent of
the frequency of occurrences of B and C, and
(4) E does not change unless it is influenced.
These assumptions are similar to those with binary cause
and effect (cf. Cheng, 1997; Pearl, 1998).
The joint influence of background cause B and candidate
cause C on the continuous outcome E is given by the linearsum rule (cf. Lu et al., 2016). According to this integration
rule, the influences of multiple causes are integrated by
simple addition. Since the outcome can take on different
values, expected value and conditional expected value are
used to describe its state. The expected value of the
continuous outcome is calculated as follows:
E[e] = P(b) ∙ wb + P(c) ∙ wc

(3)

In this equation, P(b) and P(c) denote the probabilities of
occurrences of the background cause and candidate cause.
Variables wb and wc are causal powers of the background
cause and candidate cause. Although two different
integration rules are used for a binary outcome (i.e., noisyOR rule for generative cause; noisy-AND-NOT rule for
preventive cause), there is no distinction between generative
and preventive causes in case of a continuous outcome.
When the cause is present (i.e., P(c) = 1), the conditional
expected value given the presence of the cause is
E[e|c] = P(b|c) ∙ wb + wc

(4)

Similarly, the conditional expected value given the absence
of the cause (i.e., P(c) = 0) is
E[e|¬c] = P(b|¬c) ∙ wb

(5)

Subtracting Equation 5 from Equation 4 yields the
difference in conditional expected values (i.e., ΔE = E[e|c]
− E[e|¬c]). The difference in conditional expected values is:
ΔE = P(b|c) ∙ wb + wc − P(b|¬c) ∙ wb

(6)

If we assume that the background cause and the candidate
cause occur independently, two conditional probabilities
equal to one another (i.e., P(b|c) = P(b|¬c) = P(b)).
Therefore, the causal power of the candidate cause wc is
represented as follows:
wc = ∆E − {P(b|c) − P(b|¬c)} wb = ∆E

Estimating causal power with continuous outcomes

(7)

Within the range of outcome values greater than the
minimum and less than the maximum, predicted values of
the causal power are simply the differences in conditional
expected values.
Predictions of the value of wc vary depending on the value
of the continuous outcome. To illustrate these predictions,

The reasoner’s goal is to induce the unobservable causal
power of a candidate cause from observable events (Cheng,
1997). Consider a situation where a continuous effect E may
be produced by a binary background cause B and/or a binary
candidate cause C. Assume that:

consider a situation where a teacher investigates the effect
of active encouragement on students’ homework
performance and gives 100 homework problems to each
student. For example, a student had finished 25 out of 100
previous homework problems assigned; after the
encouragement, the student finished 75 out of 100 new
homework problems assigned. The causal power wc is the
difference in performance before and after the
encouragement (i.e., ΔE = E[e|c] − E[e|¬c] = 75 – 25 = 50).
However, this is not the case where one of the outcome
values reaches the upper limit. We hypothesize that
depending on the reasoner’s assumption about the
counterfactual value of the outcome if there were no upper
limit, wc has a range of possible values. We replace E[e|c]
in Equation (4) with the assumed counterfactual value
E’[e|c]. Suppose a student had finished 50 out of 100
previous homework problems assigned and then finished
100 out of 100 new homework problems assigned. It is
inferred that the causal power is equal to or larger than 50,
but not precisely determined. Thus, the prediction of the
causal power theory is an interval. Whereas some cautious
reasoners might estimate the minimum value in the interval
(50 in this case, resulting from E’[e|c] = 100), other
reasoners might estimate a higher value in the interval (e.g.,
100, resulting from E’[e|c] = 150). When both outcomes are
at the maximum value (e.g., a student finished 100 out of
100 homework problems regardless of the encouragement),
the interval spans the entire range from 0 on and causal
power becomes undefined. We call the former the partial
ceiling situation and the latter the full ceiling situation. The
difference between the partial and full ceiling situations is a
unique feature in causal learning with continuous outcomes
that have maximum values. The predictions of the causal
power theory are shown in Table 1.
The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether
people use proper integration rules according to the type of
outcome variable and whether people differentiate between
the partial and full ceiling situations. In addition to the
conditions with continuous outcomes and binary outcomes,
we added a condition with percentage outcomes. This is

because the upper limit for percentage outcomes has a clear
maximum of 100, unlike that for continuous outcomes.

Method
Participants
A total of 136 participants were recruited from Amazon
Mechanical Turk (http://www.mturk.com/). An additional
35 participants were tested but excluded for failing to pass
the comprehension question (see below for details). All
were native English speakers and residing in the US.

Experimental design
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups
differing on the type of outcome (continuous, percentage, or
binary). For all groups, the candidate cause was a binary
variable (i.e., presence or absence of encouragement).
Exclusion by the comprehension question resulted in
unequal group sizes (56 participants in the continuous group,
43 in the percentage group, and 37 in the binary group). In
addition to manipulating type of outcome, contingency
information was manipulated within-subject (see Table 1).
In the continuous and percentage groups, there were 15
contingency conditions resulting from the combination of
five levels (100, 75, 50, 25, 0) of conditional expected
values in the presence and absence of the cause. The
difference between E[E|C = 1] and E[E|C = 0] for each
condition yielded five levels of nonnegative values in the
outcome magnitude (ΔE = E[E|C = 1] − E[E|C = 0] = 100,
75, 50, 25, 0). Similarly, the binary group had five levels of
nonnegative values in the difference (i.e., ΔP = P(E = 1|C =
1) − P(E = 1|C = 0) = 1.00, .75, .50, .25, .00). Participants in
each group completed the causal learning task for all
contingency conditions. The order of the contingency
conditions was randomized across participants.

A math teacher wants to investigate the effect of
active encouragement on students’ homework
performance. Students are given 100 math homework
problems of similar difficulty. The teacher randomly
assigns some students to receive encouragement and
assigns other students to receive no encouragement.
Imagine that you are a teaching assistant for the
class. You are responsible for checking whether or
not a student receives encouragement and how many
out of the 100 homework problems the student
finishes (0-100).
You will see several sets of student records. Each
set contains the records of students from a school
ordered in a random sequence. Each record describes

causal power theory predicts “≥100” for the continuous
group and “100” for the percentage group.

at that school.

encouragement were provided with the sentence (e.g., “The
student received encouragement” or “The student did not
receive encouragement”). The other two groups followed an
identical procedure, except that the outcomes were
expressed in percentage terms for the percentage group (e.g.,
“The student finished 75% of new homework problems”)
and as present or absent in the binary group (e.g., “The
student finished the new homework problems”). The interstimulus interval was 1000-ms, and the button to proceed to
next trial was presented 500-ms after the presentation of all
the information. Each trial was separated by a 500-ms blank
screen. Participants were required to learn causal strength of
the encouragement on homework performance through trials.
There were 16 trials for each contingency condition in
Table 1. Encouragement was present on 8 trials and was
absent on 8 trials. For the continuous group, the outcomes
were normally distributed with the variance set to be ten
times that in the binary group (see standard deviations in
parentheses in Table 1). The order of trials was randomized
within-subject. To familiarize participants with the
procedure, practice trials were presented prior to the
learning phase.
Test phase After the 16 learning trials, participants were
asked to estimate the causal strength of the candidate cause
in a counterfactual question. In the continuous group, the
question was “Suppose the next student (ID: 23456) at this
school finished 0 out of 100 previous homework problems
assigned. If the student now receives encouragement, how
many out of 100 new homework problems will the student
finish?” The responses were made on a rating scale ranging
from 0 to 100. Our scale limits the maximum strength to
100 so that responses can be compared across groups.
Similar questions were used in the percentage and binary
groups with modifications of the descriptions corresponding
to the outcome type (e.g., for the binary group, “If these 100
students now receive encouragement, how many of them
will finish their new homework problems?”). In addition,
participants were also asked to report confidence in their
judgment on a scale ranging from 0 (not confident at all) to
100 (extremely confident). After their judgments,
participants completed the next contingency condition. To
encourage the independence of judgments in each condition,
participants received the following instructions: “Recall that
the schools have students from very different socioeconomic
backgrounds, and encouragement may have different effects
on the students from school to school. Please evaluate each
school separately.”

For the continuous group, the effect was a continuous
variable (i.e., number of finished homework problems). The
same instructions were used in the percentage group with
one exception: the outcome observation was described as
“what percentage of the homework problems the student
finishes (0-100%).” In the binary group, both cause and
effect were binary variables. Specifically, the instructions
stated the outcome observation as “whether or not the
student finishes the homework problems.”
After reading the instructions, participants were asked to
answer the comprehension question that checks the
understanding of random assignment. The exact question
was (italicized sentences differed across groups):
Before you begin viewing the records of the students’
homework performance, consider the following
situation. Suppose we conduct a study, and find that:
the average number of the homework problems
students in the experimental group (those who
received encouragement) finish is 65. Likewise, the
average number of the homework problems students
in the control group (those who did not receive
encouragement) finish is 65 as well. Recall that the
students are were randomly assigned to one or the
other group. Can the homework performance in the
experimental group be attributed to encouragement?
Participants were required to provide a “yes” or “no” answer
and to justify their answer briefly. This question was
intended to exclude participants who did not read the
instructions properly and to encourage the assumption that
the influence of background causes (i.e., causes other than
encouragement) on homework performance was constant
across the two groups (cf. Buehner et al., 2003). Similar
questions were used in the percentage and binary groups
with the corresponding modifications of the descriptions in
terms of percentages. Participants received no feedback on
their answers to this question.
Learning phase The learning phase consisted of 16 trials
that presented information about the cause and effect in a
pre-post design. For the continuous group, participants were
requested to observe whether a student receives
encouragement (present or absent) and how many out of the
100 homework problems the student finishes (0-100) before
and after encouragement. On each trial, homework
performance before the encouragement for a student was
described with the illustration and text (e.g., “A student (ID:
12345) at this school finished 25 out of 100 previous
homework problems assigned”). Student ID was a five-digit
random number and designed to show that each trial
described a different student. The states of the

results. Since the causal power theory makes different
predictions for the non-ceiling and ceiling situations,
separate analyses were conducted. Figure 1 shows the mean

participants clearly differentiated between continuous and

percentage outcomes on one hand and binary outcomes on
the other. In the continuous group, judgments generally
corresponded to the difference between the conditional
expected values (i.e., ΔE = E[E|C = 1] − E[E|C = 0]).
Similar results were obtained in the percentage group, but
the trend was much more evident. In contrast, judgments in
the binary group were affected by both the difference
between conditional probabilities ΔP and the base rates of
the effect P(E = 1|C = 0). These descriptive analyses were
confirmed by statistical analyses.
A two-way mixed ANOVA with the type of outcome
(continuous vs. percentage vs. binary) as between-subjects
factor and the contingency condition (11 contingency
conditions except for the ceiling situations) as withinsubject factor resulted in a significant two-way interaction,
F(20, 1330) = 6.45, MSE = 210.3, p < .001, η G2 = .069. To
explore the results in greater detail, we analyzed the effect
of the type of outcome for each ΔE and ΔP condition. In the
ΔE = 50 and ΔP = .50 conditions, a two-way mixed
ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between the type
of outcome and contingency condition, F(2, 133) = 5.54,
MSE = 116.1, p = .005, η G2 = .036. As expected, judgments
varied as a function of the base rate of the effect in the
2
binary group, F(1, 36) = 10.95, MSE = 206.5, p = .002, η G
= .118, but not in the continuous and percentage groups, Fs
< 1. The interaction was also significant in the ΔE = 25 and
ΔP = .25 conditions, F(4, 266) = 7.76, MSE = 153.6, p
< .001, η G2 = .057, and in the ΔE = 0 and ΔP = .00
2
conditions, F(6, 399) = 2.33, MSE = 242.7, p = .032, η G
= .015. Although the incremental pattern of the results in the
binary group in the ΔP = .00 condition was inconsistent
with the predictions of the causal power theory, it may be
explained by misperception of contingency for sequential
trials due to working memory limitations. This outcomedensity effect is consistent with causal-power predictions
given the misperceptions (Cheng, 1997). It is worth noting
that a similar but smaller trend was found in the continuous
group, but not in the percentage group. This might be
because the continuous group needs an assumption of equal

upper limits to compare outcomes whereas the percentage
group does not.
Figure 2 depicts distributions of individual judgments in
the partial and full ceiling situations. In the partial ceiling
situation (i.e., 100-25, 100-50, 100-75 conditions), a range
of causal power is inferred (e.g., equal to or larger than 75 in
the 100-25 condition). The distribution of participants’
judgments appears bimodal with one mode at the minimum
value of the interval and the other at the maximum value of
the interval given our scale. These results indicate that some
participants made conservative estimates while others made
optimistic estimates. Dip tests confirmed the bimodality
both in the continuous group (D = 0.08, p = .013 in the 10025 condition, D = 0.13, p < .001 in the 100-50 condition, D
= 0.14, p < .001 in the 100-75 condition) and percentage
group (D = 0.13, p < .001 in the 100-25 condition, D = 0.16,
p < .001 in the 100-50 condition, D = 0.16, p < .001 in the
100-75 condition). In contrast, the bimodality was not
observed in the binary group, and the mode of the
distribution corresponded to the point estimate of causal
power (i.e., wc = 1).
In the full ceiling situation where the causal power cannot
be estimated (i.e., 100-100 condition), the distributions of
the continuous and percentage groups appear bimodal while
that of the binary group appear trimodal. This might be
because participants had no option to answer “I don’t know”
in our materials.

Discussion
The present study qualitatively extended the causal power
theory to deal with the continuous outcomes and tested
whether people differentiate between continuous and binary
outcomes. The results showed that people estimate causal
strength based on the linear-sum rule for continuous
outcomes and the noisy-OR rule for binary outcomes. In the
partial ceiling situation where the estimation of causal
power has a range, the distribution of participants’ ratings

other at the maximum value, suggesting some participants
made conservative estimates while others made optimistic

estimates. These results are generally consistent with the
predictions of the causal power theory.
The present study has theoretical implications for
understanding how people estimate causal power. Whereas
covariation models (e.g., ΔP model, Jenkins & Ward, 1965)
and associative models (e.g., R-W model, Rescorla &
Wagner, 1972) adopt one integration rule, Bayesian models
generally assume multiple integration rules (Griffiths &
Tenenbaum, 2005, 2009; Lu et al., 2008, 2016). Our results
demonstrate that people choose the proper integration rule
according to the type of outcome, supporting the Bayesian
models. Notably, this finding implies that people assume the
invariance of causal power as a default, consistent with the
proposal that causal invariance plays a key role in the
construction of generalizable causal knowledge (Cheng &
Lu, in press). The two integration rules respectively
represent the invariance of causal power for the two
outcome variable types. Another theoretically important
aspect is the bimodal distributions in the judgments in the
partial ceiling situations. Computational models generally
predict averaged results. The observed bimodality suggests
that models incorporating different conservatism values
and/or priors may explain individual differences in the
partial ceiling situations. Further investigations will shed
more light on the question of how people estimate causal
power.
