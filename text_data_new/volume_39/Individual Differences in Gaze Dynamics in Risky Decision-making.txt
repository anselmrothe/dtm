Abstract

while their eye movements were monitored. Gambles were
represented as a grid of colored pixels where the colors were
associated with monetary amounts and the proportion of
pixels with the probability of winning that amount. One
gamble was risky (higher possible monetary payout, but
lower probability) and one was safe (lower possible
monetary payout, but higher probability). We used a variant
of EU to model participants’ choice behavior and then
examined the relationship between model parameters and
eye movement characteristics. This experimental paradigm
enables us to bridge the gap between decision processes (as
modeled by EU) and attention and information search
patterns (as measured by eye movements).

In risky decision-making, expected utility (EU) theory is
widely used to examine people's risk attitude and choice
behavior. However, it is unknown how risk attitude relates to
attention and information search. In this paper, we explore the
relationship between risk attitude (as measured by a variant of
EU) and eye movement patterns (which serve as a proxy for
attention and information search). Participants made choices
between gambles presented perceptually as flickering grids in
which monetary values were indicated by colors and
probabilities by color proportions. To explore attention and
information search patterns, we investigated eye movement
patterns when faced with different gambles and correlated
these patterns with the parameters of EU. We observed that
people who are more risk-seeking (as determined by
modeling) tend to look at risky options more often. These
results bridge choice behaviors conceptualized by EU and
information search strategies under risky decision-making
revealed by eye movements.

Introduction
We face decision-making under risk every day in our lives,
from financial investment decisions, choosing a new job, to
voting for a presidential candidate. Lotteries, or gambles,
consisting of well-defined sets of options, are widely used in
psychological research to explore how people make
decisions under risk. Expected Utility (EU) theory
(Neumann & Morgenstern, 1947) has been widely used to
predict choices with well-defined sets of gambles in
different forms, but its connection to information search and
attention (e.g., as measured by eye movements) has not been
clearly revealed. For example, do people who are more riskseeking look more often at risky options?
Eye movements, which have been studied as a process
tracing methodology (Glaholt & Reingold, 2011), have been
shown to be related to decisions under different tasks
(Krajbich, Armel, & Rangel, 2010; Krajbich & Rangel,
2011; Shimojo et al., 2003; Stewart, Hermens, & Matthews,
2016) and tested by different models (Brandstätter &
Körner, 2014; Fiedler & Glökner, 2014). Nevertheless, the
link between risk attitude revealed by EU and attention and
information search strategy is still missing.
In the present study, participants were asked to make
risky decisions between two gambles presented perceptually

Methods
All stimuli were presented on a 23.5-inch ViewSonic
screen with a 60 Hz refresh rate at 1980  1020-pixel
resolution. The viewing distance was 68 cm and each
gamble had an overall size of 4.5°  4.5° of visual angle. In
this experiment, each trial began with a fixation cross
displayed for 0.5 second. Following the fixation cross, two
square grids were always presented diagonally at two of the
corners on the screen for maximal 2 seconds. These two
grids consisted of 20  20 10-pixel squares, which were
filled in with grey indicating a zero payout and one of three
colors (blue, rose, and yellow) indicating different positive
monetary payouts that participants learned from instructions
and practice. The proportion of color to grey (i.e., positive
payout to zero payout) was randomly selected from 15 pairs
of gambles (Table 1). Thus, participants were faced with a
choice between two nonnegative gambles that offered
different probabilities of winning different amounts of
money. The configuration of colored elements in the grids
was randomly rearranged every four frames to avoid
potential perceptual pattern biases (thus the grids

expected value. The feedback indicated whether their choice was correct or not. In practice block 3, participants were allowed to select
whichever gamble they preferred. They received feedback about their choices after every trial. In the main experiment, the participants
received feedback at the end of blocks. There was no trial-by-trial feedback during the main task.

the gamble that they wanted to play. The results of the
chosen gambles were provided to participants during block
breaks as their cumulative payouts.

The experiment had three practice blocks before the main
experiment, which consisted of 16 blocks (Figure 1). The
first practice had 20 trials. In the first practice block, we
asked participants to select the monetary value associated
with a particular color and provided feedback based on their
responses. In the second practice block, two grids were
presented that had two different colors (i.e., different
monetary amounts), but in the same proportions.
Participants needed to choose the grid with the greater
expected value (i.e., the grid with the color associated with
the higher value). The third practice block was similar to the
main experiment, except that feedback on the gambling
results was provided for each trial. Both the second and the

third practice had 15 trials. In the main experiment, each
block had 66 trials of which 10% are catch trials. During
block breaks, the payout for the current block and
cumulative payout were provided. Each gamble pair had one
risky gamble and one safe gamble. Risky gambles were
defined as gambles where positive payouts were greater
than that of safe gambles, but where probabilities of
winning were less than that of safe gambles. The difference
in expected values (ΔEV, defined as EV(risky gamble) –
EV(safe gamble)) of 15 gamble pairs ranged from about -1
to 1 (Table 1). We had three gamble pairs for each ΔEV
condition: $4.5 and $2, $7 and $2, and $7 and $4.5. Catch
trials were gamble pairs where the risky gamble had a
higher probability and greater monetary payout than the safe
gamble.

Eye movements were monitored by an EyeLink 1000
desk-mounted eye tracker (SR Research, Ontario, Canada).
We tracked participants’ dominant eye movement with both
pupil and corneal reflection settings at a sampling rate of
1000 Hz. Area of interest (AOI) was defined around the
centers of the grids and fixation cross with the size of 400 ×
400 pixels. We used these AOIs to determine when
participants were looking at each gamble and to explore the
gaze dynamics during their deliberation (Figure 2).
After the speeded risky gambling task, every participant
completed a set of surveys, which included the Cognitive
Reflection Test (CRT, Frederick, 2005), DOSPERT scale
(Blais & Weber, 2006), and Holt and Laury gambles (Holt
& Laury, 2002). In this paper, we did not include the results
from the CRT, DOSPERT scale, and Holt and Laury
gambles. Those results will be reported elsewhere.

and gamble pair and no interaction was preferred to all other
models (BFModel = 133.90) as well as the null model (BF10 =
5.32×105 ). The Bayes Factors for including ΔEV and
gamble pair were BFInclusion = 1.48×103 and BFInclusion =
286.17, respectively.

Dark, medium, and light green lines represent the three gamble
pairings.

Two participants, one of whom had less than 30% correct on
the catch trials, one who did not move his or her eyes at all
throughout the experiment, and another five participants’
data were not successfully recorded due to technical issues,
were excluded. We first analyzed the effect of ΔEV and
different gamble pairs on risky choices and response time.
We observed that the probability of risky choice increased
as the ΔEV increased (Figure 3A). The probabilities of risky
choice under the three gamble pairs were different, with the
probability of risky choice under the $7-$4.5 pair being the
highest and the $7-$2 pair being the lowest. When ΔEV is
greater than zero, which indicates that the risky gamble had
a greater EV compared to the safe gamble, the risky gamble
was more likely to be chosen. We used Bayesian methods to
analyze the data and report the resulting Bayes Factors (BF),
Based on a Bayesian two-way ANOVA, we found that the
model with ΔEV and gamble pair without their interaction
was preferred to all other models (BFModel = 636.06) as well
as to the null model (BF10 = 2.03×1037 ). The Bayes Factors
for including the variables ΔEV, gamble pairings, and their
interaction were BFInclusion ~ ∞, and BFInclusion = 731.74,
respectively. Regarding response time, risky decisions in
general took longer as the ΔEV increased. Response time
increased as ΔEV increased under the $7-$2 and $4.5-$2
pairs, but did not change much under the $7-$4.5 pair.
Based on a Bayesian two-way ANOVA, we found that a
model with both ΔEV and gamble pairings and no
interaction was preferred to all other models (BFModel =
580.70) as well as the null model (BF10 = 2.36×1013 ). The
Bayes Factors for including ΔEV and gamble pair were
BFInclusion =2.17×102 and BFInclusion=2.98×102 , respectively.
Next, we used number of fixations to investigate
information search patterns under the five ΔEV conditions
with the three gamble pairs (Figure4A). The number of
fixations is the average fixation count in non-catch trials
prior to the decision. We observed that the number of
fixations increased with increasing ΔEV, which was
consistent with response time patterns. Based on a Bayesian
two-way ANOVA, we found that the model with both ΔEV

We also observed the same gaze biases reported in
previous studies showing that eye movements made during
a choice have a strong relationship with the final choice
(Krajbich, Armel, & Rangel, 2010; Krajbich & Rangel,
2011; Stewart, Hermens, & Matthews, 2016). We compared
choice proportions when the last gaze was on the chosen
gamble with that of the unchosen gamble, and found that the
last seen gamble was more likely to be chosen as compared
to the other gamble for the three gamble pairs separately
($7-$4.5: BF10 = 37.93; $7-$2: BF10 = 4.58×104 ; $4.5-$2:
BF10 = 79.17) (Figure 4B). To investigate the influence of
different gamble pairs on the relationship of last gaze and
risky choices, we further examined the difference in
proportion of risky choice given the first or the last gaze was
in the AOI of the risky gambles. The first gaze had less
influence on final choice of the risky gambles compared to
the last gaze. For the three gamble pairs, the proportion of
choices for the risky gambles was greater when the last gaze

1396

was on the risky gamble than when the last gaze was on the
safe gamble (Table 2 and Figure 5).

(2) the perception of probabilities. The subjective utility
function is governed by alpha, which indicates an
individual's risk attitude. If alpha is less than 1, it indicates
that the person is risk-aversive. If alpha is greater than 1, it
indicates that the person is risk-seeking. If alpha is equal to
1, that person is risk-neutral.
In EU theory, the subjective value of a two-outcome
gamble G is determined by
𝐸𝑈(𝐺) = 𝑝1 𝑢(𝑥1 ) + 𝑝2 𝑢(𝑥2 ),

(1)

where 𝑢(∙) is the utility of the outcomes defined as
𝑢(𝑥𝑖 ) = 𝑥𝑖𝛼 ,

(2)

where 𝛼 is a free parameter that is greater than 0 and
quantifies the curvature of the utility function.
In EU theory, the objective probabilities are used to
compute the expected utilities of the gambles. In our
experiment, however, the probabilities of both safe and
risky gambles are presented as proportions of colors in the
flickering grids. It is possible that people’s perception or
estimation of the actual proportion does not match the exact
probabilities shown in the grids. That is, there may be
perceptual distortion of the probability estimation. In order
to capture this feature, we assume that perceived probability
is given by the following function:
𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑑 =

Hierarchical Bayesian Parameter Estimation
of “Perceptual” Expected Utility Theory
To account for choice behavior, we developed a
“perceptual” variant of EU theory. The parameters of this
model were estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian
parameter estimation approach. There are two components
of our variant of EU: (1) the subjective utility function and

𝑝𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝛽
𝜑 𝛽 + 𝑝𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝛽

(3)

where φ is the adaptation level for the proportion of color in
the grid and β is a shape parameter. The probability of
choosing option A over option B is modeled as:
𝑝(𝐴, 𝐵) =

𝐸𝑈(𝐴)
𝐸𝑈(𝐴)+𝐸𝑈(𝐵)

(4)

Hierarchical modeling serves as a compromise between a
no-individual-differences model and a full-individualdifferences model. In a hierarchical model, individual
parameters are drawn from group-level distributions, usually
normal distributions with estimated mean and standard
deviation. The estimated means quantify different cognitive
processes. The standard deviations quantify the similarity
among individual participants’ behavior.
We used the prior distributions for these three parameters
as following. Individual 𝛼𝑖 is drawn from the normal
distribution with two group-level parameters 𝜇𝛼 ~ 𝑈(0,5)
and 𝜎 𝛼 ~ 𝑈(0,10). Individual 𝜑𝑖 is drawn from the normal
distribution
with
two
group-level
parameters
𝜇 𝜑 ~ 𝑈(0,100) and 𝜎 𝜑 ~ 𝑈(0,10). Individual 𝛽𝑖 is from the
normal distribution with its group-level parameter
𝜇 𝛽 ~ 𝑈(0,100) and 𝜎 𝛽 ~ 𝑈(0,10). We implemented the
hierarchical EU model in JAGS. Posterior distributions were
approximated by 3 MCMC chains with 5000 samples from
each chain, after a burn-in of 1000 samples. Convergence of
chains was evaluated by computing the 𝑅̂ statistic. Figure 6
shows the posterior distributions of three group-level means.
The means of 𝜇𝛼 , 𝜇 𝜑 , and 𝜇 𝛽 are 0.92, 0.41, and 13.13,
respectively.

By comparing observed choices with the predicted
choices, we are able to assess how accurately the model
captures people’s choice behavior. We plot the observed
risky choice proportions from the data with the posterior
predictive of the model using the individual-level
parameters (Figure 7). The model predictions are reasonably
close to the actual proportion of risky choices indicating that
the model accounts for the group-level data.

and predicted by EU theory. Light grey bins represent risky choice
proportion from data, and dark grey bins represent risky choice

meaning that the performance of EU is reasonable at the
individual level as well.

Individual differences in gaze dynamics
To bridge the gap between the conceptualized EU model
and actual information search dynamics, we examined the
correlation of EU parameters and eye movement statistics.
We examined the correlations with four eye movement
measures: % of trials with first fixation on risky, % of trials
with last fixation on risky, proportion of gaze duration on
risk, proportion of gaze duration on chosen gambles, as well
as response time. See Table 3 for definitions of these five
measures.
In EU, the parameter α captures participants' risk
preferences. Note that EU assumes that the subjective utility
function is concave if 0 < α < 1, implying that people are
risk-averse, while the subjective utility function is convex if
α > 1, implying that people are risk-seeking. A larger value
of α implies less risk-aversion (or relatively greater riskseeking behavior). We found that α was positively
correlated with % of trials with last fixation on risky and
proportion of gaze duration on risky gamble (see Table 3).
For the two measures, the BF10 was greater than 100,
indicting extremely strong support for the correlations.
These correlations suggest that people who are more riskseeking tend to look more at risky options.

Figure 8. Comparison of risky choice proportion from the data and
that predicted by EU. The line is y = x.

To examine the performance of EU theory at the
individual level, we plot the individual data and predictions
from EU theory using the individual-level parameters
(Figure 8). Most of the data points fall on the diagonal,

- % of trials with first fixation on risky: proportion of trials in
which the first fixation after gambling presentation was on the
risky.
- % of trials with last fixation on risky: proportion of trials in
which the last fixation before decisions were made was on the
risky.
- proportion of gaze duration on risk: ratio of gaze duration on the
risky to the response time of each trial.
- proportion of gaze duration on chosen: ratio of gaze duration on
the chosen gamble to the response time of each trial.
- response time: from stimuli onset to responses by pressing keys.

The parameter 𝜑 determines the adaptation level of the
perceived probability transform function. When 𝜑 < 0.5,

1398

individuals are more adapted to small probabilities, which
also correspond to riskier options in our task (i.e., risky
gambles in our experiment have high values and small
probabilities). Thus, smaller values of 𝜑 indicate increased
adaptation for risky options. We found that the parameter 𝜑
was negatively correlated with % of trials with the last
fixation on risky and the proportion of gaze duration on
risky.
The 𝛽 parameter is the shape parameter for the
probability transform function. This parameter was not
correlated with any of the eye movement measures we
calculated.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the relationship between gaze
dynamics and “perceptual” EU parameters in risky decisionmaking. First, we corroborated previous findings that the
last fixation was closely related to actual choices (Krajbich,
Armel, & Rangel, 2010; Krajbich & Rangel, 2011; Shimojo
et al., 2003; Stewart, Hermens, & Matthews, 2016). Going
beyond this, we observed that people with different risk
attitudes have different patterns of eye movements, which
serve as a proxy for information search and attention. In
particular, we found that (i) the utility shape parameter of
EU was positively correlated with measures related to gaze
duration on the risky option and to the proportion of last
gaze on the risky option, and (ii) the adaptation level in
perceived probability was negatively correlated with the
proportion of the last gaze on the risky option and with the
gaze duration on the risky option. These results establish the
connection between risky choice behavior conceptualized
by EU and information search strategies under risky
decision-making revealed by gaze dynamics.
Given the fact that eye movements are only considered as
a proxy of internal processes of attention, we cannot rule out
the possibility that participants held the two gambles in a
mental comparison while moving their eyes. Thus, we
cannot conclude that the decision processes conceptualized
by the EU model caused specific information search
strategies or vice versa. Future studies are needed to explore
the causal relationship between gaze dynamics and choice.
For example, future studies could examine if changing
information search strategies by manipulating the salience
of risky gambles might influence people’s risky choices.
Also, manipulating exposure time of options might
influence choices.
We conclude by addressing some of the limitations of the
present study. First, all thirty-nine students were granted
course credit regardless of their performance. It is possible
that their behavior might change if there was actual
monetary reward rather than a hypothetical situation. The
three estimated parameters of EU might be different when
participants are more engaged to maximize their final
payouts (Holt & Laury, 2002). Second, in this study we did
not include gambles with pure losses or mixtures of both
gains and losses. People may adopt different strategies in

this speeded risky gambling task when losses are
introduced. Addressing these issues would be suitable for
future studies. Nevertheless, we did observe individual
differences in risk preferences as measured by EU and these
differences where related to differences in gaze dynamics.
This suggests that information search and attention is related
to underlying decision processes.
