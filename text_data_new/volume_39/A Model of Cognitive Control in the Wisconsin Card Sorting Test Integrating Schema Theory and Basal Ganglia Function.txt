Abstract

use a genetic algorithm to search the model’s parameter
space and obtain a good fit for the data. Further analysis of
correlations between error types, however, suggests the need
to model individual participant data. Yet for reasons of
computational efficiency this is impractical. We therefore
cluster participant performance into a small number of
distinct groups (5) and run separate genetic algorithms to fit
the groups individually. The results capture both group
performance and correlations between error types across
individuals.

We present a schema-based model of a classic
neuropsychological task, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task
(WCST), where competition between motor and cognitive
schemas is resolved using a variation of a neuroanatomically
detailed model of the basal ganglia (Gurney et al., 2001). We
show that the model achieves a good fit with existing data at
the group level, and correctly identifies two distinct cognitive
mechanisms held to underlie two distinct types of error.
However, at the individual level, the correlations amongst
other error types produced by the model differ from those
observed in the human data. To address this, we cluster
participant performance into distinct groups and show, by
fitting each group separately, how the model can account for
the empirically observed correlations between error types.
Methodologically, this demonstrates the importance of
modelling participant performance at the sub-group or
individual level, rather than modelling group performance.
We also discuss implications of the model for the WCST
performance of elderly participants and Parkinson’s patients.

The Task and the Model
In the WCST, participants are required to sort a series of
cards into four categories based on binary (i.e., correct /
incorrect) feedback. Each card shows one, two, three or four
shapes, printed in one of four colours, and there are four
shapes (triangle, star, cross, circle). It is therefore possible to
sort cards according to colour, number or shape. To
succeed, participants must match each successive card with
one of four target cards (One Red Triangle, Two Green
Stars, Three Yellow Crosses, Four Blue Circles), and use
the subsequent feedback to discover the appropriate rule, but
once they have discovered the rule (as indicated by a
succession of 10 correct sorts), the experiment changes the
rule without notice. The task yields a number of dependent
measures, including the number of rules obtained (with a
deck of 64 cards), the number of cards correctly sorted, the
number of perseverative errors (where negative feedback is
ignored) and the number of set-loss errors (where the
participant fails to stick with a successful rule).
The model comprises three cognitive schemas and four
motor schemas (see Fig. 1).1 Cognitive schemas represent
the selection rules (Sort by Colour, Sort by Number, Sort by
Shape) while the four motor schemas represent the acts of
putting the stimulus card below each of the four target cards.
Each schema has an activation level that varies over time as
a function of input from various sources. Cognitive schemas
are fed by an external channel that changes by a fixed
amount according to external positive/negative feedback.
Motor schemas are fed by cognitive schemas, and this signal
is rule-dependent. If, for instance, the stimulus card displays

Introduction
Schema theory is a framework based on the idea that
behaviour in many areas depends on abstractions over
instances, i.e., schemas. In these abstract terms, schema
theory is very general. It has been applied in domains
ranging, for example, from event memory (Bartlett, 1932) to
motor control (Schmidt, 1976). Norman and Shallice (1980)
applied the theory in the domain of routine sequential
action. Their theory proposes that action schemas work in a
cooperative or sequential fashion, but also compete with
each other for activation. While schema theory is helpful in
representing functional interactions in the action-perception
cycle, it is not committed to a specific neural
implementation. However, at the neural level the basal
ganglia have been proposed as a good candidate for
resolving competition between schemas in order to carry out
action selection (Redgrave et al., 2001). In part this is
because of their recurrent connections with the cortex.
In this paper we present a model of the Wisconsin Card
Sorting Task (WCST) where competition between motor
and cognitive schemas is resolved using a variation of a
neuroanatomically detailed model of the basal ganglia. We

(Gurney et al., 2001). Corticobasal loops are mostly
segregated (Alexander et al., 1986) and this is reflected in
the model through the independence of information
processed in the basal ganglia units at the two levels
(cognitive and motor).
The model also implements a rudimental learning
mechanism. This consists in a fixed change in signal to the
cognitive schemas following a reward. Its purpose is to
analyse how baseline levels of signal influence schema
selection and ultimately, performance on the WCST.
Manipulation of the thresholds of saturation functions in
cortical units and associated basal ganglia units represent
dopamine signalling in the cortex and in the basal ganglia,
respectively. Therefore, the mechanism underlying
cognitive control is a feedback-driven signal to the cognitive
schemas.

Figure 1: Schematic of the model, not showing
competition between schemas. Cognitive schemas (top
row) send signals to the motor schemas (bottom row)

Computation in Individual Units
The model consists of 7 cortical units, 3 of which control
cognitive operations and 4 of which control motor
operations (see Fig. 1). These units correspond to schemas.
Cognitive and motor units send their signal to their
respective striatal units (see Fig. 3). Subthalamic units
connect all units at the same hierarchical level (cognitive or
motor), ensuring that the basal ganglia units act as a
competitive suppressor of schemas as a function of the other
schemas’ outputs.
Individual units are connected as shown in Fig. 3. Their
computations are shown below. In all cases, ui represents
the entry signal to the unit, ai is the result of integration
along the time domain, and oi represents the output of the
individual units. The function σ computes the sigmoid
function of the input, ensuring output values are bounded
between 0 and 1. Sigmoid functions have a fixed slope and
threshold. Varying the threshold of cortical or striatal units
alters the way competition between units is carried out, and
can be considered a function of tonic dopamine present in
the circuit. (In a separate simulation it has been shown that
the level of external dopamine from the substantia nigra pars
compacta (SNpc) unit can be simulated by varying the
threshold of the saturation curve in the striatum (βctx),
without making use of an additional unit.)

schemas. The basal ganglia units compute the amount of
inhibition that each schema receives given the activation
of the others.
three red circles, the colour schema will excite the fourth
motor schema (Four Blue Circles), the shape schema will
excite the third motor schema (Three Yellow Crosses), and
the colour schema will excite the first motor schema (One
Red Triangle). Motor schemas are also fed by
environmental cues depending on the stimulus card feature.
Thus, when cognitive schemas are not strong enough to
influence motor schemas, action selection may be driven by
stimulus features only.
This simple model is complemented by a mechanism that
implements and resolves competition between schemas
within each hierarchical level: cognitive and motor schemas
feed into two parallel computational mechanisms that each
return a signal in the form of inhibition to the individual
channels at each level (see Fig. 2 for an illustration at the
cognitive level). In the brain, this competition between
schemas is thought to be carried out by the basal ganglia

sorting criterion. Feedback alone is not sufficient, as the
selected card may match more than one feature. Basal
ganglia units intervene by supressing the inappropriate
cognitive schemas, enabling the correct schema to be
permanently selected. When the sorting criterion changes
(after 10 correct responses) the system tends to perseverate
for a short period of time, before selecting the correct
criterion again. Feedback-dependent external activation and
resolution of competition both play a role in activating the
correct cognitive schemas. Whereas the activation of
cognitive schemas is regulated by feedback, the activation
of motor schemas is regulated by cognitive schemas and
environmental cues.

Feedback
Feedback takes place after each trial. If the selected
response is correct, the external signals oext,i to the cognitive
units2 that correspond to the matched features are increased
by a fixed amount bl. If the selected response is incorrect,
inputs to those units that correspond to the matched features
are decreased by a fixed amount bl.

Parameters
The model has a number of parameters. One important
parameter is the threshold of the saturation curve of the
striatum, represented by the threshold of the sigma function
applied to the striatal output (βstr). Extreme values of this
parameter (substantially greater than or less than 0.5) disrupt
the competition between schemas. When the threshold is too
high schemas are driven by their input values and they
undergo increasingly homogenous inhibition from the basal
ganglia. This phenomenon is analogous to the Parkinson's
disease dopamine depletion in the SNpc (Cooper & Shallice,
2000).

Simulation of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
Simulation of an Individual Task
To simulate the WCST, a virtual deck of 64 cards is
produced, shuffled and presented to the model. All the units
perform the computation outlined in the previous section.
The first motor unit to reach a fixed activation value
(measured as the area under the time-curve, rather than
simply as a threshold) is selected. After the selection and
feedback, a new card is presented. The resulting plot for
activation of the cognitive units is shown in Fig. 4.
As can be seen in Fig. 4, when the first card is presented
the system must work out that ‘colour’ is the first correct

Dependent Measures
Performance was scored according to a range of measures as
indicated in Heaton (1981). Completed Categories (CC) and
Total Errors (TE) measure the overall performance. A Set

neurologically healthy young participants. Z values
indicate the z score of the difference between human and
simulated data for each dependent measure.
Loss Error (SL) is counted whenever an incorrect response
is selected after 5 or more correct responses, where at least
one is unambiguous (i.e., the card matches only one
feature). A Perseverative response (PR) is counted
whenever a response would have been correct under the
previous rule. (A subject can score a perseverative response
even before completing the first category: if three
consecutive responses are made selecting the same sorting
rule, that rule will be the criterion that the subject can
perseverate to.) Those perseverative responses that are also
incorrect responses are counted as Perseverative Errors
(PE). Non-perseverative errors (NPE) are calculated as the
Total Errors (TE) minus Perseverative Errors (PE).

correlation matrices for these variables in both the human
data and the simulation.
The correlation matrices show that the simulation
correctly identifies that the mechanism that produces set
loss error can be dissociated from the process that causes
other types or errors. However, the simulation fails to
reproduce the high correlation (r = .91, p < .01) between
Total Errors and Perseverative Errors. In addition, it
displays a weak but significant negative correlation (r = .31, p < .01) that is not present in the empirical data.

Results
Results for two sets of 48 participants (48 healthy young
adults and 48 simulated participants) are depicted in Fig. 5.
The figure compares the aggregate results from the
simulation (Sim) with the aggregate data from the human
participants (Data).
A genetic algorithm attempted to find the best parameters
that produce low t statistics and low z statistics between data
and simulation. Given the presence of a multitude of
parameters that influence each other in a non-linear fashion,
a perfect fit is unattainable. However, the model appears to
do a good job in reproducing group mean and standard
errors, as shown by the figure.

Discussion
The model yields an adequate fit for young participants on
the WCST. Computation in the model appears to be stable,
in that minimal parameter variations do not disrupt
functioning. The model also correctly reflects the
independence between Set Loss Errors (SL) and Total
Errors (TE) found in the human data, suggesting a
dissociation in the cognitive processes that produce those
errors.
However, the model is subject to several limitations. The
lack of positive correlation between PE and TE in the
simulation is both puzzling and concerning. One possibility,

Correlational Analysis
Analysing aggregate data is not sufficient to assess model
performance, since a model should also aim to dissociate
between psychological constructs (Cassimatis et al., 2008).
Therefore, correlational analysis between the most
informative variables (TE, PE, SL) was also performed,
using bootstrapping and sampling the mean value to obtain
1000 points. Multiple runs of the sampling algorithm
produce very similar results. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show the

however, is that this apparent failing reflects the implicit
assumption that performance of the human participants can
be modelled by a single set of parameter values (i.e., by a
group of 48 virtual participants with identical cognitive
characteristics). We explore this possibility in the following
section.

Grouping Data
Introduction
In the light of the failure of the model to reproduce the
empirically observed correlations between TE and PE, we
analyse how data from young participants can be clustered
into a small number of groups based on the three critical
dependent variables reflecting errors (TE, PE, SL).
These three types of errors have been specifically chosen
because they are most representative of performance
failures. Data clustering was calculated using a k-means
algorithm with k = 5 (purely for reasons of computational
efficiency). Two points were excluded because they were
outliers. The algorithm was initialised based on the
observation of the spatial 3D distribution of points. The
most distinctive features are the accumulation of points
around the origin, the sparseness of points as total and
perseverative errors increase, and an isolated cluster of
points with SL equal to 1.
Fig. 8 shows how the clustering of the groups and Table 1
shows mean and standard deviation of the dependent
variables in the individual groups.

Discussion
Results from the simulation are shown in Table 2. In total, 4
outliers have been excluded from the analysis (2, 1 and 1
from categories 3, 4 and 5, respectively). These outliers may
conceivably have been produced by the model’s unstable
response to increasingly higher parameter values. Clustering
the participant data into a small number of more
homogenous groups greatly increases the correlation
between TE and PE (r increases from .04 to .50, compared
with the observed value of .92) and decreases the correlation
between SL and TE/PE, improving the fit of the model in
both respects. Fig. 10 displays the new correlation plots
worked out combining all of the five simulations together.

Simulation
After clustering the groups, as outlined in Table 1, we run
five genetic algorithms separately to determine best-fitting
parameter values for each group. In each case, seven model
parameters were initially randomised to values within their
reasonable ranges, and model errors recorded. A t-value
between the simulation’s and the original experimental data
was computed and its mean used as the inverse of the GA’s
fitness value. Table 1 shows performance errors of the
simulation with the highest fitness and Fig. 9 shows a 3D
representation of the individual values.

General Discussion
The model we presented combines a variation of the Cooper
and Shallice (2000) model of action selection and a
variation of the Gurney et al. (2001) model of the basal
ganglia. One of the strengths of this combined model is the
possibility to generalise it to other cognitive control tasks
(e.g. Stroop task, Probabilistic Reversal Learning, Eriksen
Flanker Task, etc.) and to accommodate the presence of

performance in the elderly and PD patients3.
These two joint findings suggest that the cognitive
mechanisms producing perseverative and set loss errors
might be independent only for a small number of errors. As
that number increases, these two mechanisms might be
correlated and possibly causally related. New experimental
data to confirm this hypothesis is warranted.

computation is performed (e.g., amygdala, cerebellum),
enabling the simulation of cognitive tasks in broader
contexts (e.g. Emotional Stroop Task, WCST in cerebellar
patients). In principle, this enhances the contention
scheduling theory with neuroanatomical detail, allowing a
more precise localisation of processes in a particular task,
and integration with functional neuroimaging data. In
addition, this implementation allows for the inclusion of two
distinct learning mechanisms in the cortex and the basal
ganglia: the current model can potentially be updated to a
learning-based model by developing these mechanisms.
With respect to cortical learning, in the model as it stands,
the supervisory system that controls how subjects respond to
positive and negative feedback is fixed and consequently
performance tends to be too robust to basal unit
dysfunctions. This might be addressed by incorporating
dynamic learning that allows supervisory control to vary
according to the schemas’ activations, resulting in low or
high baseline levels of dopamine in the striatum having a
greater impact on cognitive performance.
The present paper makes the case for modelling subgroup data (or, whenever possible, individual data), instead
of aggregate results, and presents evidence of how data
clustering improves the model overall fit. Clustering is
especially advisable for models of higher-order cognition,
where subjects tend to have variable attention and may use
qualitatively different cognitive strategies.
A final conclusion emerges from two joint observations:
First, fitting clusters with increasingly extreme error values
becomes increasingly more problematic. Second, another set
of simulations (not reproduced here) shows that damaging
the cortical and subcortical units threshold does not seem to
produce the level of decline in performance found in
Parkinson's disease patients without dementia (Paolo et al.,
1996). Since healthy older controls have a different
performance profile than the younger controls against which
the current model was assessed, the loss of dopaminergic
