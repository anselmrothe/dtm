Abstract
We contrast two views of how contextual influence on sentence meaning
composition can be explained. The Semantic Similarity View maintains
that discourse context affects sentence meaning mainly because of the
semantic similarity between the words in the discourse context and the
words in the sentence (as measured by Latent Semantic Analysis). The Free
Pragmatic View, in contrast, defends the claim that also pragmatic aspects
of the discourse context can affect sentence meaning composition. This
effect can be quantitatively modelled by Bayesian Pragmatics. We
introduce a Predictive Completion Task in which the hearer at every
moment in a communicative situation has to generate a probabilistic
prediction about how a discourse being uttered by the speaker is continued.
We test the predictions of the two views in EEG using the well-established
observation that the conditional probability of a word given a context is
negatively correlated with the amplitude of its N400 component.

a sentence given a preceding discourse. Quantitatively, the
semantic similarity can be determined by Latent Semantic
Analysis (Landauer & Dumais, 1997), whereas we will use
the framework of Bayesian Pragmatics (Frank & Goodman,
2012) to calculate the pragmatic influence – in particular,
concerning the rationality of the speaker’s intentions in a
narrative. As a model of lexical structure we apply the
Generative Lexicon approach (Pustejovsky, 1995). In our
experimental design we will use the established observation
that the conditional probability of a word given a preceding
context is negatively correlated with the amplitude of its
N400 component measured in EEG.

Introduction
It has been widely acknowledged that a preceding
discourse can influence the way sentence meaning is
composed from lexical meaning. In this paper we want to
adjudicate between two competing views of how discourse
context affects sentence meaning. A prominent view is that
the contextual influence is mainly due to the semantic
similarity between parts of the discourse context and the
words in the target sentence (e.g., as in semantic priming;
Otten & Van Berkum, 2008). It is however highly
controversial whether also pragmatic aspects of the
discourse context other than the mere resolution of
indexicals and anaphors can immediately affect sentence
meaning composition. Nieuwland and Van Berkum (2006)
have argued that discourse contexts can overturn violations
of animacy. For a noun denoting an object that would
normally be regarded as inanimate (e.g. peanut) the feature
of animacy can be introduced if the preceding discourse
context specifies a suitable situation (e.g., a romantic story
whose protagonist is a peanut). Here predicates that would
normally conflict with the noun because they require
animacy (the peanut was in love) were actually more easily
predictable than canonical predicates (the peanut was
salted), as revealed by an enhanced N400 for canonical
predicates as compared to animacy-violating predicates.
To investigate the contrast between a Semantic Similarity
account of contextual influence and a Free Pragmatic
account that allows for free pragmatic enrichment in
sentence meaning composition, we will look into the way
subjects make probabilistic predictions on the completion of

The general idea of Bayesian Pragmatics is to account
for the rational cooperation between speaker and hearer in
an act of communication by modelling the hearer’s
probabilistic
expectations
about
the
speaker’s
communicative intentions by Bayes’s Theorem. Bayesian
pragmatics has been successfully used e.g. to explain results
in a number of behavioral experiments (e.g., Frank &
Goodman, 2012). It has so far not been validated in EEG
studies.
Bayesian pragmatics offers itself as a model also in what
one might call the Predictive Completion Task (PCT) of
communication. Predictive coding is widely acknowledged
in cognitive science as a general mechanism by which the
subject at every point in time generates the most probable
prediction of the next event on the basis of ongoing
perceptual input and learned statistical regularities (Hohwy,
2013). In a PCT the hearer at every moment in a
communicative situation has to generate a probabilistic
prediction about how a sentence/discourse being uttered by
the speaker will be continued. To get a quantitative grasp of
this task, we define 𝑃𝑇 (𝑎|𝑐) as the conditional probability of
a sentence/discourse being continued with the word 𝑎 given
that the word is preceded by a context 𝑐 under the
assumption that the complete sentence/discourse is true. We
will call 𝑃𝑇 the truth-guided predictive probability function
of the hearer. The problem of the hearer is to estimate the
truth-guided predictive probability.
The Semantic Similarity and the Free Pragmatic views
provide competing theories of how the hearer accomplishes
the Predictive Completion Task. To be able to discern
between the two theories and given that the overall
frequency of the word 𝑎 in language use and the syntactic
congruency of the word 𝑎 relative to the preceding context

3504

is known to have a major influence on 𝑃𝑇 (𝑎|𝑐), we will in
the course of this paper (and in the experiment) presuppose
that the frequency of 𝑎 is held invariant and that the
syntactic congruency between 𝑎 and its context is granted.
According to the first view, 𝑃𝑇 (𝑎|𝑐) should be estimated
solely on the basis of the semantic similarities between the
lexical meaning of the word 𝑎 and the semantic properties
of the preceding context 𝑐. The semantic similarity can be
quantified by Latent Semantic Analysis, LSA (Landauer &
Dumais, 1997).
The Free Pragmatic View in contrast maintains that
pragmatic aspects of the discourse directly interact with
meaning components retrieved from the lexicon as well as
with any further node in the sentence meaning composition
tree. It thus challenges a rigorous notion of
compositionality, according to which the meaning of a
complex expression is determined by the meanings of its
syntactic parts and the way the parts are combined
(Werning, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2012). Pragmatic
enrichment is supposed to be “free” because not only lateral
modulations of a word or phrase are allowed, e.g. when the
meaning of a word is modulated by the meaning of its
argument – cut the cake (vertical cutting) vs. cut the grass
(horizontal cutting) – but any, however remote information
can in principle modulate the meaning of a linguistic
expression at any stage in semantic composition. For
example, cut the grass, given a lawn-seller situation, might
be interpreted as vertical cutting. Accordingly, a situation
introduced in a discourse preceding the sentence may result
in the modulation of the meanings of words or phrases in
the sentence and of the sentence itself (Cosentino,
Adornetti, & Ferretti, 2013). These modulations will then
influence the intuitive truth-conditions of the sentence. This
view, as developed for example by Recanati (2012) amounts
to a weakening of the rigorous notion of compositionality
by introducing context-dependent semantic flexibility by
means of modulation. In the Predictive Completion task
Bayesian Pragmatics can be used to quantitatively model the
Free Pragmatic account (see Predictions).

Design
The contrasting quantitative predictions of the Semantic
Similarity and the Free Pragmatic views can be applied to a
previous EEG experiment of ours (Cosentino, Baggio,
Kontinen, Garwels, & Werning, 2014; Cosentino, Baggio,
Kontinen, & Werning, 2017). To design the experiment we
combined a particular idea of Pustejovsky’s (1995)
Generative Lexicon approach with Gibson’s (1979) notion
of affordances. According to the Generative Lexicon
approach, the lexical entry of concrete nouns (e.g. banana)
contain a “Qualia Structure” which, among others, specifies
a so-called Telic component (e.g. eat) that is retrieved in
sentence meaning composition. This retrieval is typically
triggered by verbs like use and enjoy that take the respective
noun as argument. This explains why sentences such as (a)
and (c) are typically understood as having the meaning of
(b) and, respectively, (d):

(a) The child enjoyed the banana.
(b) The child enjoyed eating the banana.
(c) The man used his jackknife for the cake.
(d) The man used his jackknife for cutting the cake.
In turn, Gibson proposed that many objects come with
subject- and situation-dependent affordances. These are
dispositional properties (e.g., sit-ability) that relate to
actions to be potentially performed on that object (Werning,
2010). We distinguish between ad-hoc affordances and
generic affordances. Generic affordances are affordances of
a class of objects that are represented as part of the mental
concept of the class (e.g., chair – sit). Ad-hoc affordances
are affordances that a particular object has for a particular
agent in a particular situation (e.g., this chair – hide under,
for a child in a peekaboo game). In line with Pustejovsky,
generic affordances are often stored as telic components in
the lexicon of nouns and thus in semantic long-term
memory.

Table 1. Sample stimuli for EEG experiment on context effects on Telic
lexical component. The table illustrates a 2x2 design, in which two
categories of noun-verb combinations, +TLex and −TLex, are combined
with two categories of discourse contexts, Telic Standard Context
(TStdCtx) and Telic New Context (TNewCtx). The cue verb is underlined
while the corresponding noun preceding the cue verb is in bold. The
original stimuli were Italian and here are translated to English.

In our 2x2 experimental design (see Tab. 1) the first
variable – TelicLexicalMatch - refers back to Pustejovsky’s
notion of a Telic component. The Telic component of the
lexical entry specifies the function or the purpose of an
object. With regard to the variable TelicLexicalMatch the
two conditions, +TLex vs. −TLex varied in whether the cue
verb (e.g., pour or, respectively, hang) expresses the telic
component in the lexical entry of a given noun 𝑛 (e.g.,
funnel). With regard to the second variable – TContext – we
varied the discourse context such that in the first condition
TStdCtx a standard context preceded the target sentence,
whereas in the second condition TNewCtx the preceding
discourse context introduced a new telic role as an ad-hoc
affordance for the object denoted by the noun, facilitating an
action expressible by the −TLex verb (hang).

Predictions
Semantic Similarity View: With word frequency held
constant and syntactic congruency granted, the Semantic
Similarity view now entails that the only predictor for a verb
given its preceding context is the semantic similarity of the
former to the latter. Given that we leave the corresponding
noun 𝑛 (funnel), which precedes the cue verb 𝑣𝑖
(pour/hang), the same in all four conditions, the semantic
similarity is a cumulative (i.e. in both arguments strictly
monotonously increasing) function 𝑓 + of the semantic
similarity 𝑆(𝑣𝑖 , 𝑛) between the verb and the noun and the
semantic similarity 𝑆(𝑣𝑖 , 𝑐𝑗 ) between the verb and the
preceding context 𝑐𝑗 excluding the noun. According to this
view the truth-guided predictive probability 𝑃𝑇,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) of
the verb 𝑣𝑖 following the noun 𝑛 given the context 𝑐𝑗 should
hence be estimated by the hearer as follows (see Eqn. (4) in
Table 2).
Semantic Similarity view:
𝑃𝑇,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) = 𝑓 + (𝑆(𝑣𝑖 , 𝑛), 𝑆(𝑣𝑖 , 𝑐𝑗 )).
The experimental settings were chosen such that the
semantic similarity – determined by LSA –between the cue
verb and the context excluding the noun was invariant
across all four conditions (see Eqn. (6) in Table 2).
Therefore, 𝑃𝑇,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) should depend solely on whether the
verb expresses the telic lexical component of the noun, i.e.
belongs to +TLex, and correspondingly has a high semantic
similarity to the noun – determined again by LSA – as
opposed to a verb belonging to –TLex with a low semantic
similarity to the noun (see (5)). We can now immediately
mathematically derive the four comparative predictions
regarding 𝑃𝑇,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) for 𝑖 ∈ {+𝑇𝐿𝑒𝑥, −𝑇𝐿𝑒𝑥} and
𝑗 ∈ { 𝑇𝑆𝑡𝑑𝐶𝑡𝑥, 𝑇𝑁𝑒𝑤𝐶𝑡𝑥}. These predictions are captured
by the formulae (11), (15), (16) and (17) shown in Table 2
together with their derivations.
Bayesian Pragmatics: If the Free Pragmatic as opposed
to the Similarity View is true the hearer will use a different
strategy to estimate 𝑃𝑇 (𝑎|𝑐). From a pragmatic point of
view, narratives are goal-directed discourses. In our
examples the speaker has the goal to attribute an action to
the narrative’s protagonist which s/he performs on a given
object: In the above examples, performing the action of
pouring or, respectively, hanging on the funnel. In the
narrative, the speaker embeds this action in a situation
which he may introduce by a discourse context that precedes
the description of the action. The speaker in other words has
to choose a preceding context to let this action appear
rational. To describe this choice situation quantitatively we
can define the rationality-guided conditional probability
𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑐𝑗 |𝑣𝑖 ) as the probability of the speaker to choose –
under the assumption of narrative rationality – a context 𝑐𝑗
given that he aims at attributing to the protagonist the action
denoted by 𝑣𝑖 to be performed on the object denoted by 𝑛.
Using Bayes’s Theorem 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑐𝑗 |𝑣𝑖 ) can be transformed to
allow the hearer, in the PCT, to estimate the truth-guided

predictive probability by equating it to the rationality-guided
probability of the speaker (see Eqns. (1) and (3) in Table 2):
Free Pragmatic view:
𝑃𝑇,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) = 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ),
where, according to Bayes’s Theorem,
𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) = 𝐾(𝑐𝑗 ) ∙ 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑐𝑗 |𝑣𝑖 )𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 ).
−1

Here
𝐾(𝑐𝑗 ) = (∑𝑣∈𝑉 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑐𝑗 |𝑣)𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣))
is
a
normalizing factor and 𝑉 is the set all (syntactically
congruent) verbs. We may assume that the rationalityguided prior probability 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 ) of an action expressed by
the verb 𝑣𝑖 being performed on the object denoted by the
noun 𝑛 is fully determined by the semantic similarity
between the verb and the noun as computed by LSA (see
Eqn. (2)):
𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 ) = 𝑆(𝑣𝑖 , 𝑛).
For, the lexical entry of a concrete noun can be assumed
to reflect the semantic memory of the learned statistical
regularities between objects denoted by the noun and
actions rationally performed on them. This assumption is
part and parcel also of the idea that concrete nouns have
telic lexical components in the sense of Pustejovsky’s
(Pustejovsky, 1995) Generative Lexicon. If the verb
corresponds to the telic lexical entry of the nouns, the
semantic similarity between them should hence be high. In
the experimental settings we can implement a comparative
variation of the rationality-guided probability 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑐𝑗 |𝑣𝑖 ) of
the speaker to choose a context 𝑐𝑗 given that he aims at
attributing to the protagonist the action denoted by 𝑣𝑖 to be
performed on the object denoted by 𝑛 as captured by the
inequalities (7)-(10) in Table 2. This immediately allows us
to generate comparative predictions about the conditional
predictive probability of the hearer as a consequence of the
Bayesian interpretation of the Free Pragmatic view. Making
the idealizing assumption that the normalizing factor, which
is unknown not only to us, but also to the hearer, is the same
for all contexts and in particular, 𝐾(𝑐1 ) = 𝐾(𝑐2 ) = 𝐾, we
can generate predictions not only for comparisons within the
same context, but also across contexts. The so attained
predictions of the Free Pragmatic view are captured in
formulae (11), (12), (13) and (14) in Table 2, shown
together with their mathematical derivation history.
Correlation with N400 amplitude: To test the
predictions, we exploited an empirically already well
established relationship between the probability of a word
given a preceding context and the amplitude of the N400
component of the event-related potential measured on the
onset of the word in EEG. Granted that the cue word is
syntactically congruent with its context (i.e., no syntactic
violation) and that the frequency as well as length of the
word are invariant, the truth-guided predictive probability
𝑃𝑇 (𝑎|𝑐) of the word 𝑎 given the preceding context 𝑐 is
negatively correlated with the amplitude of the word’s
N400. Support for the negative correlation between the
truth-guided predictive probability of a word given a

3506

preceding context and the word’s N400 comes from
multiple sources of evidence. Most importantly, Cloze
probability is a strong predictor of the amplitude of the
N400 component. Cloze probability values are obtained by
asking participants in a Cloze task to complete an
incomplete sentence with the word they consider to be the
most likely completion. Kutas & Hillyard (1984) found that
the amplitude of the N400 component measured on the
target word has a nearly inverse linear relationship with its
Cloze probability, that is, relative to more expected words,
the N400 amplitude increases as the expectancy of a word in
context decreases. DeLong, Urbach, & Kutas, 2005
confirmed that the preceding words in a sentence are used
by readers to estimate relative likelihoods for upcoming
words and the differences in the likelihood of the target
word are reflected in differences regarding the N400
component. This effect has been observed not only in single
sentences (Van Petten, Coulson, Rubin, Plante, & Parks,
1999), but also for short texts (Otten & Van Berkum, 2007;
Van Berkum, Brown, Zwitserlood, Kooijman, & Hagoort,
2005). Even more subtle differences in the semantic
relatedness between the words in a sentence are found to
influence the conditional probability of an upcoming word
and affect the amplitude of the N400 measured on that
word. For instance, in the sentence The girl was writing
letters when her friend spilled coffee on the
tablecloth/paper” the semantically unrelated word
tablecloth elicits a larger N400 than the semantically related
word paper (Baggio, van Lambalgen, & Hagoort, 2008).
The integration of world knowledge during the
interpretation of sentences such as The Dutch trains are
yellow/white/sour and very crowded (the target words are
underlined) also modulates the amplitude of the N400
component. This reflects the role of the (Dutch) subjects’
knowledge that Dutch trains are typically yellow for
establishing the conditional probability of the target word
(Hagoort, Hald, Bastiaansen, & Petersson, 2004). This
stresses the point that the predictive conditional probability,
in fact, is guided by expectations regarding the truth of the
continuing sentence. Additional evidence of a negative
correlation between the predictive conditional probability of
a word and the amplitude of its N400 component is
provided by a study previously conducted in our laboratory.
In a sentence-picture verification study on scalar
implicatures, logical and pragmatic responders provide
different truth-value judgements to under-informative
sentences (e.g., Some As are B, when it is known that all As
are B). Whereas logical responders evaluate these sentences
as true, pragmatic responders reject them as false. These
divergent responses correlate with significant differences
regarding the N400 and can be explained on the basis of
expected probabilities of words relative to truth presumed
by the subject (Spychalska, Kontinen, & Werning, 2016).
Similar findings have been reported in a study about bare
numerals (Spychalska, Kontinen, Noveck, Roesch, &
Werning, 2015).

Experiment
Method: Twenty-two right-handed native speakers of
Italian (13 males; mean age = 29.2 years) were presented
with a total of 160 stories in a 2x2 design (see Table 1). The
ERPs recording was time-locked to the onset of the cue
words, which were always verbs occurring in the midst of
the sentence and matched on word length, number of
syllables and mean word frequency. The preceding contexts
were pair-wise matched for number of words. The
experimental stimuli were translated into English and
underwent Latent Semantic Analysis to check for the
semantic similarity values between the cue verbs and the
preceding nouns or, respectively, between the cue verbs and
the preceding contexts. Whereas the difference
between 𝑆(+𝑇𝐿𝑒𝑥, 𝑛) and 𝑆(−𝑇𝐿𝑒𝑥, 𝑛) was significant
(t(39)=5,449, p<.001), there was no significant difference
between the cue verbs and the preceding contexts across all
experimental conditions. Using average amplitude per
condition across all EEG electrodes, a 2(Context: TStdCtx
vs. TNewCtx) × 2(TelicLexicalMatch: +TLex vs. −TLex)
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed in the time window between 400 and 500 ms
after critical word onset. A follow-up ANOVA was
performed which involved specifically a predetermined
region over centro-parietal sites at which the N400 is
maximal. In this case, a 2(Context: TStdCtx vs. TNewCtx)
× 2(TelicLexicalMatch: +TLex vs. −TLex) × 7 (Electrodes:
CP1, CP2, CPz, Pz, P1, P2, POz) ANOVA was conducted.
Bonferroni-adjusted planned comparisons were performed
to decompose the effect of trial type in this region.

Figure 1. Crossing over regarding the N400 component. Bars show the
average amplitude of the N400 for the four conditions. The numbers in
brackets correspond to the inequalities as predicted by the Free Pragmatic
View (see Table 2, (11), (12) and (13)). Note that the fact that the
difference between the +TLex and the −TLex verb in TNewCtx is not
significant is also consistent with Free Pragmatic View (14).

Results: Given the standard context TStdCtx, the N400
for –TLex (M(TStdCtx, –TLex) = -1.67 µV) is significantly
enhanced compared to +TLex (M(TStdCtx, +TLex) = -.64
µV, t(20)=3.069, p=.006, CI 1.03 ± .70). Relative to the
standard context TStdCtx, the TNewCtx significantly
enhances the N400 component for +TLex (M(TStdCtx,
+TLex) = -1.15 µV, t(20)=2.276, p=.034, CI .51 ± .47),
whereas it significantly reduces the N400 component for –
TLex (M(TStdCtx, –TLex) = -.88 µV, t(20) = -2.745,

3507

p=.012, CI -.79 ± .60. Finally, given a preceding context
TNewCtx, the mean amplitude of the N400 component
measured on +TLex was not significantly different
compared to that measured on –TLex (t(20)=.964, p=.34)

Discussion
In order to test the predictions made by the Free
Pragmatic View and the Semantic Similarity View, we rely
on the empirically well-founded observation that the truthguided conditional probability 𝑃𝑇 (𝑎|𝑐) of the word 𝑎 given
the preceding context 𝑐 (granted that no syntactic violation
is involved and that features such as the frequency and
length of the word are constant) is negatively correlated
with the amplitude of the N400 component measured on that
word succeeding the context.
In our experimental settings, we determined the
semantic similarity 𝑆𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 ) between the meaning of the verb
𝑣𝑖 and the preceding noun 𝑛 using LSA. This value gives us
the prior probability of 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (+𝑇𝐿𝑒𝑥) and, respectively,
𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (−𝑇𝐿𝑒𝑥) with the former (pour corresponds to the telic
lexical component of funnel) being higher than the latter
(hang does not correspond to the lexical component of
funnel), as reported in equation (5). We also determined the
semantic similarity values between the verb 𝑣𝑖 and the
discourse context 𝑐𝑗 excluding the noun and kept these
values constant across all experimental conditions (see (6)).
With regard to what is relevant for the Semantic Similarity
View, the experimental conditions differ only in the
semantic similarity values between the verb 𝑣𝑖 and the
preceding noun 𝑛. The Semantic Similarity view entails that
these values are the only predictor of differences in the
truth-guided conditional probability of the verb given the
preceding context and the noun (see (11), (15), (16) and
(17)) and, hence, they are the only predictor of differences
regarding the amplitude of the N400 component.
The Free Pragmatic view focuses instead on the
differences in the rationality-guided probability of the
speaker choosing a certain context given that he attributes to
the narrative subject the aim of performing a certain action
with an object. In the Free Pragmatic framework, the
rationality-guided probability that the speaker chooses a
standard context TStdCtx (e.g., funnel in a chemistry
experiment) given that he attributes to the narrative subject
the aim of performing the action denoted by the +TLex verb
(pour) with the object denoted by the noun 𝑛 (funnel) is
higher than that of choosing this context given the attributed
aim of performing with that object the action denoted by the
–TLex verb (hang) (see inequality (7)). Furthermore, it is
more rational for the speaker to choose a context TNewCtx,
which introduces a new ad-hoc affordance for the object
(funnel glued to the wall), compared to choose the standard
context TStdCtx, given that he attributes to the narrative
subject the aim of performing the action denoted by the –

TLex verb (hang) with the object denoted by 𝑛 (see (8)). As
captured by inequality (9), the rationality-guided probability
of the speaker choosing the standard context TStdCtx
compared to TNewCtx is higher given that he attributes to
the narrative subject the aim of performing the action
denoted by the +TLex verb with the object denoted by 𝑛.
Finally, as expressed by (10), the rationality-guided
probability that the speaker chooses TNewCtx given that he
attributes to the narrative subject the aim of performing the
action denoted by the −TLex verb with the object denoted
by 𝑛 is higher than the rationality-guided probability of
choosing this context given the attribution to the narrative
subject of the aim of performing the action denoted by the
+TLex verb with the object denoted by 𝑛.
Given that the Free Pragmatic view estimates the truthguided predictive probability of a word by equating it with
its rationality-guided probability (see (1)), the Free
Pragmatic view not only predicts (11), in line with the
Semantic Similarity View, but, in contrast to the Semantic
Similarity View, predicts a crossing-over regarding the
N400 component, as expressed by the inequalities (12),
(13). With regard to the comparison expressed in (14) the
Free Pragmatic View does not make an unambiguous
prediction. For, a greater/smaller comparison of the values
of the product 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) = 𝐾(𝑐𝑗 ) ∙ 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑐𝑗 |𝑣𝑖 )𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 )
depends not only on the numerical value of the prior
probability 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 ) , which is given through the equation
𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 ) = 𝑆(𝑣𝑖 , 𝑛), but also on the unknown numerical
value of and not just the inequalities between the likelihoods
𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑐𝑗 |𝑣𝑖 ).
Given the negative correlation between the truth-guided
conditional probability of a word given a preceding context
and the amplitude of its N400 component, the results of our
EEG study can be used to directly evaluate the different
predictions of the two views. In our experiment, we found
that, if preceded by a standard discourse context TStdCtx, a
–TLex verb incongruent with the noun’s telic component
(funnel-hang) elicited an enhanced N400 compared to a
+TLex verb congruent with the telic component (funnelpour) (confirming (11)). However, given a discourse context
TNewCtx, in which a new function for the object is
introduced as an ad-hoc affordance, we observed a crossingover regarding the direction of the N400 effect: Comparing
TNewCtx with TStdCtx, first, the N400 for the –TLex verb
was significantly smaller in TNewCtx than in TStdCtx
(disconfirming (15) and confirming (12)). Second, the N400
for the +TLex verb was significantly greater in TNewCtx
than in TStdCtx (disconfirming (16) and confirming (13)).
Finally, given a preceding context TNewCtx, the N400
measured on the +TLex verb was not significantly different
compared to that measured on the –TLex verb (see Fig. 1).
This result is not decisive between the two views (neither
confirming nor disconfirming (17) and being consistent with
(14)).
The reported differences regarding the N400 component
are best explained by the assumption that hearer
accomplishes the Predictive Completion Task as envisaged

by the Free Pragmatic View, namely by estimating
𝑃𝑇,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) through equating it with 𝑃𝑅,𝑛 (𝑣𝑖 |𝑐𝑗 ) and
applying Bayes’s Theorem to it. Indeed, the crossing-over
regarding the N400 cannot be explained solely in terms of

the differences in the semantic similarity values between the
target verb and the preceding noun, as assumed by the
Semantic Similarity account.
