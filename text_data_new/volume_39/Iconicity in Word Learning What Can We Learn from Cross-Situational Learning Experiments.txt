Abstract

Perry, Perlman, and Lupyan (2015), analysing English
and Spanish, found a negative correlation between iconicity
and age of acquisition: even in Indo-European languages, it
may play a role in acquisition.
However, substantial questions remain about what
advantage iconicity confers on word learning. Does
iconicity kick in after the problem of identifying a word’s
meaning has already been solved, with iconic words being
encoded in memory more quickly or efficiently? Or does
iconicity help by facilitating referential disambiguation?
Experiment 1 will begin to address this question.

Iconicity, i.e. resemblance between form and meaning, is a
widespread feature of natural language vocabulary (Perniss,
Thompson, & Vigliocco, 2010), and has been shown to
facilitate vocabulary acquisition (Imai, Kita, Nagumo, &
Okada). But what kind of advantage does iconicity actually
give? Here we use cross-situational learning (Yu & Smith,
2007), to address the question for sound-shape iconicity (the
so-called kiki-bouba effect, Ramachandran & Hubbard,
2001). In contrast to Monaghan, Mattock, and Walker (2012),
Experiment 1 suggests that the iconicity advantage comes
from referential disambiguation rather than more efficient
memory encoding. Experiments 2 and 3 replicate this result,
and moreover show that the kiki-bouba effect is roughly
equally strong for sharp and rounded shapes, a property that
classic experiments were unable to confirm, and which has
implication for the effect’s mechanism

Introduction
Iconicity as Widespread in Natural Language
The meaning of a word does not determine its form, but
wordforms are often motivated by iconic relationships with
meaning. In English, iconicity can be found in
onomatopoeia, (e.g. bang, miaow). Outside the IndoEuropean family, iconicity is more pervasive. Large iconic
lexica are reported for many unrelated languages, signed
and spoken (see Perniss et al., 2010).
Such iconicity is not limited to sounds. In Japanese
reduplication of syllables indicates repetition of an event,
and voicing of an initial consonant indicates object size (e.g.
gorogoro – heavy object rolling repeatedly; korokoro – light
object rolling repeatedly; Perniss et al., 2010).

Iconicity and Word Learning
Experimental work shows that Japanese sound-symbolic
words are easier for 3-year-olds to learn than non-iconic
words, whether the children are Japanese or English
speakers (Imai et al., 2008; Kantartzis, Imai, & Kita, 2011;
Yoshida, 2012).
Observational research suggests a role for iconicity in
vocabulary acquisition outside the lab. Japanese children
acquire iconic words early (Maeda and Maeda, 1983), and
in keeping with this Saji and Imai (2013) find that Japanese
caregivers use more sound-symbolic and onomatopoeic
words speaking to their toddlers than to adults.

A near-universal form of iconicity is the association
between certain sounds (e.g. back vowels and high sonority
consonants) with heavy, slow, rounded objects; and others
(e.g. front vowels and low sonority consonants) with small,
quick, jagged objects (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001). In
standard demonstrations, participants are given images of
two 2-dimensional shapes, one round, the other spiky. The
majority pairs ‘kiki’ with a spiky shape, and ‘bouba’ with a
rounded shape. (Dingemanse & Lockwood, 2015).
The mechanism of sound-shape iconicity is, however,
uncertain. The effect could arise from correlated input from
different sensory modalities. Alternatively, Ramachandran
and Hubbard (2001) suggest it is a reflection of cross-modal
analogy between the articulatory gestures required to
produce the labels and the visual properties of the shapes (p.
19). They also suggest that ‘cross-wiring’ (p. 21) of auditory
and visual brain maps may create an unmediated link.
Another possible explanation is more literal
correspondences between speech sounds and lip shape.
‘Bouba’ involves literal rounding of the lips – visual or
motoric representations of lip rounding could mediate
between ‘round’ sounds and objects. This account predicts
an asymmetry: round sound-shape associations should be
stronger than spiky ones, because round sounds involve
literal rounding of an articulator, whereas spiky sounds do
not involve any comparable spikiness. Some prior ERP
evidence suggests that the round association may be
stronger than the spiky one in processing (Kovic, Plunkett,
& Westermann, 2010 – though their paradigm could not
separate the associations behaviourally). This dissociation is
not something that the classic kiki-bouba experiment is able
to test: with two words and two shapes, one (hypothetically
stronger) sound-shape pairing would automatically
determine the other (weaker or absent) pairing. However our

2321

Experiments 2 and 3 will represent some of the first work
ever to address this question.

Cross-Situational Learning
Monaghan, Mattock, and Walker (2012) established that the
classic kiki-bouba effect is found using the cross-situational
learning (CSL) paradigm. CSL takes the form of a series of
trials where a word is appears along with a number of
possible referents (Yu & Smith, 2007). Any single trial is
ambiguous, and initially participants must guess, but
information can be integrated across trials to solve this triallevel referential ambiguity.
Monaghan et al.’s referents were round and spiky shapes,
and their names were iconically round or iconically spiky
nonwords. Half of shapes received iconically congruent
names (e.g. rounded shape-round name), and the other half
iconically incongruent (e.g. rounded shape-spiky name). In
each trial the participant saw two shapes, heard one name,
and indicated which shape the name belonged to. Would
accuracy in choosing the correct referent would be higher
for congruently named items?
Monaghan et al. found that congruence was no advantage
in the first block, but became advantageous in later blocks.
Moreover the advantage was only present in trials where the
unnamed shape (the foil) was from the opposite category to
the target. From the first result they concluded that iconicity
indeed supports word learning (perhaps e.g. in the sense of
facilitating more rapid or robust memory encoding of iconic
names); from the second they that the advantage pertains to
category level information, and not to information
distinguishing individual words within categories.
These results are somewhat surprising. The classic kikibouba experiment involves guessing names. If iconicity is
expressed there, then why wouldn’t it be expressed in the
first block, when participants are forced to guess namereferent pairings? If that bias were expressed from the start,
then iconicity might support referential disambiguation.
Experiment 1 takes up this question. Experiments 2 and 3
attempt to tease apart effects of round vs. spiky iconicity.

Experiment 1
Methods
Participants 24 adult native English monolinguals (13
women, M = 29.7 ± 10.0).
Visual Stimuli (Shapes) Sixteen shapes were created using
the GNU Image Manipulation Program. Eight ‘spiky’
shapes were created using randomised parameters. Eight
‘rounded’ shapes were created by taking each spiky shape
and using its corners as fixed points for Bezier curves, then
scaled by eye to match for perceived size (see Figure 1).
Stimuli were 600*600 pixel images comprising the shape in
black on a white background.

orthography that feature consonants with only one canonical
pronunciation (N = 85; c, g, q, and x were excluded) were
rated by monolingual Anglophones who did not participate
in other studies (N = 28, 12 women, 28.5 ± 12.0 years old)
on a ten-point scale anchored by a circle (1) and a star (10).
Eight of the names were constructed using syllables that
received the spikiest ratings (example: tikiza), eight using
the syllables that received the roundest ratings (example:
mujo). For each category of name, two were one syllable
long, four were two, and two were three. Recordings were
made by a female native speaker of North American
English, pronouncing the words as she considered natural.
Subsequently, word recordings were normed as part of a
wider norming study. 101 native English speakers (M = 32.4
± 9.7, 41 women) were each given 118 speech tokens to rate
(largely from another study), meaning that each speech
token was rated about ten times. The study was performed
using Qualtrics (2015). In each trial, the participant saw a
seven-point ratings scale. ‘1’ represented the roundest
rating, and ‘7’ the spikiest (counterbalanced for half of
participants). The mean of each token’s ratings was then
taken. This was its WordScore. Names for Experiments 2
and 3 were also rated for WordScore (see below). T-tests
confirm that spiky names (M = 4.71 ± 0.53) were rated as
significantly spikier by WordScore than round names (M =
2.90 ± 0.43) (p < .001, t(13.4) = 7.54, difference = 1.81,
95% CI [1.29 ,2.33]; Cohen’s d = 3.77).
Apparatus and Procedure The study was run using Matlab
7.4.0 on an IBM compatible PC equipped with a 15”
monitor (resolution: 1024×768). For each participant, half
the shapes in each category received congruent names (e.g.
round names for round shapes). The other half received
incongruent names (e.g. spiky names for round shapes).
Assignment of names to shapes was counterbalanced
between participants.
The experiment took the form of a series of 256 trials,
each featuring two shapes on screen (one to the left and one
to the right – see Figure 1) and one name (played through
headphones). The name belonged to one of the two shapes
(this shape was the target, the unnamed shape being the
foil). The participants stated which shape the name belonged
to (by pressing the left or right arrow). Participants received
no feedback and had to guess at first, but in time could infer
which name belonged to which shape by noting that each
name only consistently appears with one shape.

names were presented aurally, not in text)

Auditory Stimuli (Names) Names were constructed on the
basis of LetterScore, a text-based index of sound-shape
iconicity: All consonant-vowel pairings in English

2322

Trials were grouped into four blocks of 64 trials, as in
Monaghan et al.. Within each block each name appeared
four times, and each shape appeared four times as a target
and four times as a foil. The number of times each shape
appeared on each side of the screen in each role was
counterbalanced, as was the number of appearances by each
shape as a foil for a target from its own category vs. the
opposite category. The same name was not permitted two
trials in a row. Otherwise trials were randomised.

Results
Trials with reaction times of less than 0.5 seconds or more
than 25 seconds were removed.
Statistical Methods Data was analysed using the LMEM
package lme4, version 1.1-12 (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, &
Walker, 2015) running in R version 3.2.1 (R Core Team,
2015). In addition to random intercepts for names and
participants, we also included random slopes. We aimed for
a design-driven maximal random effects structure (see Barr,
Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013), but were limited in the
number of random effects we could fit. For participants we
included random slopes for linear block, congruence,
category of foil (coded as same or different to category of
target), and the congruence-category of foil interaction. For
names, we were limited to random effects slopes for
congruence, category of foil, and their interaction. Block
was coded linearly (1 = -1.5, 2 = -0.5, 3 = 0.5, 4 = 1.5), and
both other variables were contrast coded (incongruent = 0.5, congruent = 0.5; same category foil = -0.5, different
category foil = 0.5). Our predictor was accuracy: i.e.
whether participants answered correctly on given trials.
Overall Analysis The omnibus model showed reliable
effects only of linear block (β = 0.84, 95% CI [0.658,
1.022], z = 9.066): participants learned; and congruence (β =
0.417, 95% CI [0.128, 0.706], z = 2.826): participants
performed better with congruent names (see Figure 2). The
congruence-category of foil interaction was also significant
(β = 0.702, 95% CI [0.203, 1.201], z = 2.759): congruence
represents more of an advantage when the foil shape is from
the opposite category to the target.

Block 1 Monaghan et al. found that congruence interacted
with block. Crucially, there was no congruence advantage in
the first block, implying that the benefit of congruence was
to memory encoding rather than kiki-bouba style response
bias. By contrast, we found no interaction between
congruence and block (z < 0.7), suggesting an advantage
from the first block. To test this, we fitted a model for the
first block only. There were reliable effects of congruence
(β = 0.328, 95% CI [0.047, 0.609], z = 2.288): performance
was better in congruent trials; and of the interaction between
congruence and category of foil (β = 0.842, 95% CI [0.368,
1.316], z = 3.484): the benefit of congruence was stronger in
different-category-foil trials. Note that this cannot be
attributed to differences in design, as the number and
structure of our trials was identical.
To exclude the possibility that this is the result of learning
within the first block, we took the 187 trials with a different
category foil where a participant encountered a name for the
first time, and fitted a LMEM featuring only a fixed
intercept, and random intercepts by participant. On 56.1% of
trials participants chose the iconically congruent referent for
the name. The model’s intercept was not reliably different
from zero under two-tailed interpretation (β = 0.247, 95%
CI [-0.048, 0.549], z = 1.678), but under a one-tailed
interpretation, the intercept was significantly different from
zero at p = .047. Thus though this analysis has low power, it
suggests a sizable bias towards iconic matches before
learning has taken place, which can only be explained by the
bias/referential disambiguation account.
In conclusion, we largely replicated Monaghan, Mattock,
and Walker’s (2012) findings, but found an advantage of
iconicity from the first block. This difference with
Monaghan et al. – and the fact that iconic congruence is
only an advantage when the foil is from the opposite
category – is consistent with the possibility that iconicity
biased participants towards the right answer in trials where
they were forced to guess, effectively assisting with
referential disambiguation. The discrepancy with Monaghan
et al. may be due to name stimuli: while we tailored ours to
maximize iconicity, they created theirs on the basis of
phonetic features, which do not correlate perfectly with
iconicity (e.g. Monaghan et al. used plosives as spiky
sounds, but [b] – a plosive – is widely deemed to sound
round, cf. bouba). Next we move on to two further
experiments aimed at testing the relative contribution of
roundness and spikiness to sound-shape iconicity.

Experiments 2 and 3
Experiment 2 and 3 aim to clarify the mechanism of soundshape iconicity by modifying Experiment 1 in order to test

2323

the effect of round-to-round and spiky-to-spiky iconicity
separately, something previous experiments have been
unable to do. This is achieved by using iconically neutral
names as well as round and spiky names. Experiment 2
yielded marginally significant results, so Experiment 3 was
a replication to attempt to verify whether the effect was real.
Both were then submitted to omnibus Bayesian statistics.
We opted for a two-condition design. Each condition is of
the same format as Experiment 1, and each features both
round and spiky shapes, but one condition features round
and neutral names only, the other features spiky and neutral
names only, thus avoiding problems related to tasks that
involve discrimination between a round and spiky
alternative. If one class of name is less iconic then we
would expect minimal benefit of one class of shape being
paired with that class of name vs. a neutral name.

Experiment 2: Methods
Participants were 32 adult native English monolinguals (17
women, M = 23.3 ± 4.4).
Visual Stimuli (Shapes) The eight round and eight spiky
shapes used in Experiment 1 were combined with an
additional eight of each, created in the same manner.
Auditory Stimuli (Names) 32 names were generated using
previously normed syllables (see Experiment 1) - eight from
round syllables, eight from spiky, and 16 from neutral; and
recorded as in Experiment 1. T-tests confirm that the spiky
names (M = 4.71 ± 0.53) were rated as spikier than the
round names (M = 2.90 ± 0.43) (p < .001, t(13.4) = 7.54,
difference = 1.81, 95% CI [1.29, 2.33]; Cohen’s d = 3.77).
Moreover, neutral names (M = 3.77 ± 0.80) were rated as
less spiky than spiky names (p = .002, t(20.0) = 3.46,
difference = 0.94, 95% CI [0.37, 1.51]; Cohen’s d = 1.31),
and less round than round names (p = .002, t(21.8) = 3.46,
difference = 1.04, 95% CI [0.35, 1.39]; Cohen’s d = 1.24).
Apparatus and Procedure Every participant took part in a
round and a spiky condition. Each condition was of identical
form to Experiment 1. One of the two conditions was the
‘round’ condition. In this condition half of the shapes were
round and half spiky (eight of each), and, crucially, half of
the names were round and half neutral. The other condition
was the ‘spiky’ condition – which again had eight round and
eight spiky shapes, but by contrast had eight neutral names
and eight spiky names (fresh shapes and neutral names were
used in the second condition). Shapes, neutral names, and
condition order were counterbalanced across participants.
Here congruence is defined within whichever half of the
putative round-spiky spectrum of sounds the condition in
question covers. E.g. in the round condition, round nameround shape pairings were considered congruent and round
name-spiky shape pairings were considered incongruent.
However, neutral name-spiky shape pairings were
considered congruent for the purposes of the following
analysis. The reverse was done for the opposite condition.

This format was so that we could apply the same kinds of
analysis as for Experiment 1 to keep results comparable.

Experiment 2: Results
Data were analysed as in Experiment 1. The additional
variable of condition was coded Round = -0.5, Spiky = +0.5.
In the omnibus model, both linear (β = 0.722, 95% CI
[0.619, 0.824], z = 13.835) and quadratic block (β = -0.11,
95% CI [-0.179, -0.041], z = -3.116) were reliable
predictors: performance improved over the blocks, with
improvement being faster between early than late blocks.
Category of foil was also a reliable predictor (β = 0.162,
95% CI [0.015, 0.309], z = 2.163): performance was better
on trials with foils from the opposite category to the target.
Finally, the interaction between congruence and category of
foil was reliable (β = 0.286, 95% CI [0.013, 0.56], z = 2.05):
performance was better on congruent trials as long as the
target and foil were from different categories (the main
effect of congruence was not reliable: β = 0.027, 95% CI [0.14, 0.194], z = 0.317; perhaps because iconic contrast was
less pronounced than in Experiment 1).
The crucial interaction between condition and congruence
was marginally reliable in the expected direction, implying
that congruence was more of an advantage in the round
condition (β = -0.208, 95% CI [-0.482, 0.066], z = -1.486):
an inconclusive result (though the same was not true for the
three way interaction adding category of foil: β = -0.047,
95% CI [-0.377, 0.283], z = -0.277).
As with Experiment 1, we analysed Block 1 in isolation.
There was a reliable effect of condition (β = 0.177, 95% CI
[0.001, 0.354], z = 1.967): performance was better in the
spiky condition. Though there was no overall effect of
congruence (z < 1.3), there was a reliable effect of category
of foil (β = 0.173, 95% CI [0.022, 0.325], z = 2.246):
performance was better when the foil and target were from
different categories, and a reliable interaction between
congruence and category of foil (β = 0.39, 95% CI [0.105,
0.675], z = 2.679): that congruence was advantageous when
foil and target were from different categories. Given that
previous results suggest that the congruence advantage is in
different-category-foil trials, this means that as in
Experiment 1, and in contrast to the results of Monaghan et
al., iconic congruence was an advantage from the outset.
Finally, there was a reliable interaction between congruence
and condition: for Block 1 (as was marginally the case for
the omnibus model), the effect of congruence was stronger
in the round condition (β = -0.315, 95% CI [-0.628, -0.002],
z = -1.975).
To summarise, Experiment 2 largely replicated the results
of Experiment 1. Additionally, we did not find an
unambiguously reliable difference between round and spiky
conditions in terms of iconicity advantage. However, the
marginally reliable interaction is possible evidence for
round iconicity being stronger. Experiment 3 is a nearreplication aimed at clarifying this.

Experiment 3: Methods

2324

Participants were 32 adult native English monolinguals (21
women, M = 21.8 ± 3.2).
Visual Stimuli (Shapes) Were as Experiment 2.
Auditory Stimuli (Names) A fresh set of 32 names (eight
round, eight spiky, and 16 neutral) were generated as in
Experiment 2. An additional factor was controlled: number
and distribution of phonemes in each category of name.
Names were recorded as in Experiments 1 and 2.
T-tests confirm that the spiky names (M = 4.80 ± 0.39)
were rated for WordScore as spikier than the round names
(M = 2.90 ± 0.63) (p < .001, t(11.7) = 7.19, difference =
1.90, 95% CI [1.32, 2.47]; Cohen’s d = 3.60). Moreover,
neutral names (M = 3.80 ± 0.86) were rated as less spiky
than spiky names (p < .001, t(22.0) = 3.91, difference =
1.00, 95% CI [0.47, 1.53]; Cohen’s d = 1.35), and less round
than round names (p = .01, t(18.5) = 2.89, difference = 0.90,
95% CI [0.25, 1.55]; Cohen’s d = 1.24).
Apparatus and Procedure Were as in Experiment 2.

Experiment 3: Results
Data were analysed as in Experiment 2. The omnibus model
featured reliable effect of linear block (β = 0.739, 95% CI
[0.589, 0.889], z = 9.641): participants learned. However, it
featured no other significant predictors (|z| < 2.0). In this
respect, it was different from Experiments 1 and 2, both of
which showed some advantage of congruence. However, the
coefficients for both congruence (β = 0.177, 95% CI [0.003, 0.357], z = 1.929) and the congruence-category of
foil interaction (β = 0.178, 95% CI [-0.081, 0.437], z =
1.346) were in the expected direction, with congruence
qualifying as marginally reliable. Crucially, the congruencecondition interaction did not approach reliability (β = 0.047, 95% CI [-0.326, 0.233], z = -0.327), and neither did
the interaction between congruence, category of foil, and
condition (β = -0.147, 95% CI [-0.464, 0.17], z = -0.908)
suggesting that if there was an effect of congruence, it was
no stronger in the round condition.
Again we analysed Block 1 in isolation. This time there
were no reliable predictors (z < 1.3 in each case). However
note that this parallels the omnibus model, which featured
no reliable predictors except block. Thus these results are
silent on the question of the nature of the iconic advantage
as the advantage failed to show up overall (probably due to
a smaller iconic differences between words than in
Experiment 1 leading to a weaker effect and Type II error).
Thus Experiments 2 and 3 gave somewhat contradictory
results, with Experiment 2 showing a marginally reliable
interaction between condition and congruence in the
expected direction, and Experiment 3 showing no such
thing. To attempt to resolve this, we submitted both sets of
results to Bayesian statistics, which have the capability to
confirm the null, and make it unproblematic to add more
data to an analysis as one goes along (Kruschke, 2011).

Models Not having a clear prior for the alternative
hypothesis, we opted for Bayesian parameter analysis
(Kruschke, 2011). We use the R package rstanarm (Gabry &
Goodrich, 2016). We examined 95% Highest Density
Intervals for parameter estimates (HDIs): the highest
average density continuous interval containing 95% of
posterior probability distribution. If this region excludes
zero we can treat a predictor as reliable.
We based our priors on Gelman, Jakulin, Pittau, and Su’s
(2008) recommendations. All variables were centred at zero
and scaled so as to have a standard deviation of 0.5. Priors
(which were defined for the log odds ratios used as the
models’ parameters rather than for raw probabilities) took
the form of Cauchy distributions.
Models were similar to the models used for Experiments
2 and 3, but a predictor and a by-subjects random slope
were added for condition order. All two- and three-way
interactions were included.
Results There were credible effects of linear (β = 1.638,
95% HDI [1.45, 1.835]) and quadratic (β = -0.155, 95%
HDI [-0.255, -0.06]) block, condition order (β = 0.472, 95%
HDI [0.322, 0.620]), and category of foil (β = 0.091, 95%
HDI [0.019, 0.164]): participants performed better on trials
where the target and foil shapes came from different
categories. The HDIs for the main effect of congruence
encompass zero (β = 0.087, 95% HDI [-0.022, 0.198]),
albeit narrowly. However, there is a credible interaction
between congruence and category of foil (β = 0.242, 95%
HDI [0.114, 0.369]), indicating that an advantage for
congruence is present when the target and foil are from
different categories. There were interactions between
condition order and both linear (β = 0.329, 95% HDI [0.196,
0.462]) and quadratic (β = -0.213, 95% HDI [-0.333, 0.094]) block, indicating that initial learning was faster in
the second condition. There was also a difficult-to-interpret
interaction between quadratic block, condition order, and
congruence (β = -0.253, 95% HDI [-0.498, -0.009]).
However, overall, the Bayesian analyses confirm the earlier
inferential statistics.
Turning to the crucial interaction of congruence with
condition type: the posterior distribution for the interaction
between congruence and condition type is narrow compared
to the prior, and centred close to zero (β = -0.022, 95% HDI
[-0.165, 0.125]). If we assume the largest absolute value in
the HDI, and take the intercept as our baseline, the
difference between the levels of the interaction is 84.2%
versus 85.3%. This is the same as the difference when the
main effect of congruence is examined in the same way,
assuming the mean of the posterior.
Even if we assume that the extreme values of the HDI are
correct, the effect of the congruence-condition interaction is
no bigger than that of congruence tout court (which applies
to both conditions). Thus there is clearly less support for the
interaction between congruence and condition type than for
the effect of congruence across conditions, and given the

Experiments 2 and 3: Bayesian Analysis

2325

HDIs encompass zero, our results are consistent with their
being no congruence-condition interaction.

Discussion
We presented evidence that iconicity enhances performance
in a statistical learning paradigm. Experiment 1 was a
replication of Monaghan et al. (2012), and thus in a sense
not novel, but (as small but theoretically interesting
differences in our respective results underscore) the value of
replication is increasingly recognised in cognitive science.
Close analysis of the beginning of Experiment 1 (supported
by the results of Experiment 2), and the consistent tendency
for iconicity to be a greater advantage when the foil
presented during the trial does not also match the name,
suggest that the benefit of iconicity in these experiments is
to do with picking out the right referent during a particular
trial rather than in to do with learning in some other sense
(contra Monaghan et al.). Thus one role of iconicity in
vocabulary learning may be in referential disambiguation, in
line with evidence that people guess iconic word meanings
in unfamiliar languages above chance (Imai et al., 2008).
The second set of findings relate to the relative
importance of rounded-rounded and spiky-spiky mappings
in sound-shape iconicity. One hypothesis is that rounded
sounds are associated with rounded lip shape, and that the
iconicity arises from sound-shape correspondences during
speech production and comprehension (Ramachandran and
Hubbard, 2001). If this is indeed the mechanism for soundshape iconicity, we would expect rounded associations to be
primary, and spiky associations to arise later through
something like a principle of contrast. If this were the case
then rounded associations should be stronger than spiky
associations (as suggested in Kovic. et al., 2010).
Experiment 2 and 3 tested this possibility by separating
round and spiky iconicity into two separate conditions, and
seeing whether iconic congruence exerted a stronger effect
in one or the other. Experiment 2 appeared to suggest (with
marginal reliability) that iconicity improved performance in
the round condition, but not the spiky. However, this
asymmetry failed to replicate in Experiment 3. We therefore
submitted data from both experiments to a Bayesian
analysis. Though the results were somewhat inconclusive,
they suggest that any asymmetry between the conditions is a
smaller effect than the overall influence of iconic
congruence, and indeed they are consistent with there being
no asymmetry at all. However, this may be different in the
case of production, which would force motoric and
perceptual engagement with lip shape (Jones et al., in prep.).
Our results advance our understanding of iconicity’s role,
suggesting it supports referential disambiguation.
