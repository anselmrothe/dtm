Abstract
People rely on various frames of reference (FORs), such as
egocentric (EFOR) and intrinsic (IFOR), to represent spatial
information.
The
present
study
examined
electroencephalogram profiles on a two-cannon task, which
could regulate the conflict of IFOR-IFOR (red cannon, blue
cannon) and IFOR-EFOR (target cannon, observer), to
elucidate the brain mechanisms of FOR conflict processing by
using event-related potentials (ERPs). Results showed that
both of the conflicts occurred in the reaction time (RT) and
there was an interaction between them. ERP results showed
more negative amplitudes on N2 (276-326 ms) and P3 (396726 ms) for IFOR-IFOR conflict of the 180° cannon angle
condition and EFOR-IFOR conflict of the target cannon
point-down condition. What’s more, there was also an
interaction between these two conflicts on the P3 amplitudes
(561-726 ms). In summary, our findings shed new light on the
domain-specific conflict monitoring and domain-general
executive control for the IFOR-IFOR and EFOR-IFOR
conflicts.

Introduction
People adopt multiple frames of reference (FORs) to
represent the spatial relationship of objects in a complex
environment (Sun & Wang, 2014). Based on the
relationship with the observer, FORs can be classified into
three types, egocentric FOR (EFOR), intrinsic FOR (IFOR)
and allocentric FOR (AFOR) (Mou & McNamara, 2002;
Tamborello, Sun, & Wang, 2012). An EFOR-based
representation is anchored to the observer, which needs to
be updated following the movement of the observer’s eye,
head, body coordinates (Wang, Johnson, & Zhang, 2001). In
an IFOR-based representation, an object or an object group
in the viewing environment but exogenous to the observer is
used as the reference point. For example, a car is used as an
IFOR anchor in the description “the cat is in front of the
car”. IFORs remain stable with the observer’s movement
but have to be updated when the reference object moves. In
an AFOR-based representation, the entire environment, such
as a room or a city, is taken as the reference point. For a
comprehensive review, see (Mou, Fan, McNamara, & Owen,
2008; Mou & McNamara, 2002; Sun & Wang, 2010, 2014;
Tamborello et al., 2012; Yamamoto & Philbeck, 2013).

“Frame of Reference-based Map of Salience” theory
(FORMS) states the human brain represents spatial
information simultaneously using multiple FORs, all FORs
consist of a FOR map of different salience, and human
performance is determined by the interaction of all relevant
FOR-based representations (Itti & Koch, 2000; Sun &
Wang, 2010, 2014; Tamborello et al., 2012; Wang et al.,
2001; Wang, Sun, Johnson, & Yuan, 2005).
If different FORs generate different responses for one
target, conflict may occur which requires cognitive control
to solve it (Chen, Weidner, Weiss, Marshall, & Fink, 2012;
Nan, Li, Sun, Wang, & Liu, in press; Sun & Wang, 2014;
Tamborello et al., 2012). According to the different kinds of
FORs in the map (one EFOR, one AFOR, multiple IFORs),
we could categorize the conflict of FORs as four types:
EFOR-AFOR, EFOR-IFOR, AFOR-IFOR, and IFOR-IFOR.
Plenty of studies has demonstrated that there exists the
conflict of EFOR-AFOR (Chen et al., 2012; Conson,
Mazzarella, Donnarumma, & Trojano, 2012; Zhang et al.,
2014), EFOR-IFOR (Wang et al., 2005). In addition,
previous studies also showed the process of EFOR and
AFOR were in parallel. EFOR has high salience and is
almost processed automatically that needs little cognitive
resource; EFOR is represented and processed in the dorsal
visual stream subserving goal-directed actions. AFOR has
low salience and needs more cognitive resource to process.
AFOR is represented and processed in the ventral visual
stream subserving the conscious perception of objects or
spatial memory function (Goodale & Milner, 1992; Zhang
et al., 2014).
However, does it also exist a conflict of IFOR-IFOR and
AFOR-IFOR? There were rare studies focusing on this
question. If yes, how does our brain process and solve all
these conflicts of different FORs (IFOR-IFOR, EFOR-IFOR,
EFOR-AFOR, AFOR-IFOR)? What’s more, in view of the
limit cognitive resource, is the process of the multiple
IFORs also in parallel as same as the process of EFOR and
AFOR, or just in serial? If the process is in serial, only one
IFOR could be represented and processed, so we could only
observe the EFOR-IFOR conflict. Mou et al.(2002, 2008)
found that people got higher accuracy for recalling spatial
objects’ locations represented by IFOR than that represented
by EFOR, this means that people might prefer to use IFOR

2790

to represent the environment, so IFOR might not need much
cognitive resource. According to this, the process of
multiple IFORs might be in parallel, different IFORs could
be represented and processed, so we could observe the
IFOR-IFOR conflict and the interaction among IFOR-IFOR
conflict and the EFOR-IFOR conflict.
Following these questions and hypothesis, we developed a
two-cannon task (see Figure 1) which could manipulate the
EFOR-IFOR and IFOR-IFOR conflicts (Nan et al., in press;
Tamborello et al., 2012). The EFOR-IFOR conflict was
examined by the target cannon orientation (congruent
condition: target cannon pointed-up, incongruent condition:
target cannon pointed-down). The IFOR-IFOR conflict was
examined by the cannon angle (congruent condition: 0°
cannon angle, incongruent condition: 180° cannon angle).
The behavioral studies’ results showed that the IFOR-IFOR
and EFOR-IFOR conflicts (RTs of the incongruent
conditions were longer than that of the congruent
conditions), and there was an interaction between these two
conflicts. The cannon angle effect supported the hypothesis

Figure 1. A schematic illustration of the two-cannon task.
At the beginning of each trial, a stimulus with two cannons
(one blue and one red) and eight pellets (in either blue or red)
was presented on the computer screen for 1000 ms, then the
target would flash a yellow ring for 1000 ms, participants
were asked to press two buttons in the keyboard to rotate the
target cannon (with the same color of the target) to the target
in the least distance, as quickly as possible. Cannon angle
(0°,180°) was designed to test the conflict of IFOR-IFOR,
target cannon orientation (target cannon point-up: the
combination of target cannon points up-left, up, and up-right
conditions; target cannon point-down: the combination of
target cannon points down-left, down, and down-right
conditions) was designed to test the conflict of EFOR-IFOR.

that there existed the IFOR-IFOR conflict. The target
cannon orientation effect supported the hypothesis that there
existed the EFOR-IFOR conflict. The interaction between
two conflicts supported the hypothesis that the process of
different IFORs was in parallel which the two conflicts
would be interactive at the late response-selection stage. In
summary, the behavioral results suggested that our brain
might use a shared conflict processing mechanism for the
IFOR-IFOR and EFOR-IFOR conflicts.
However, how does the conflict processing mechanism
work at the neural level? Are they just process by the same
conflict processing mechanism or by distinct conflict
processing mechanisms? The event-related potential (ERP)
has a high temporal resolution at the millisecond scale and
could more directly reveal the brain activities of the
cognitive process, so it is an excellent index to examine the
neural mechanism of the FORs conflict processing (Luck,
2014). For the conflict processing, increasing
electroencephalogram (EEG) evidence has demonstrated
that the conflict-related N2 component which occurs
approximately 250–350 ms after stimulus presentation is an
effective indicator (Folstein & Van Petten, 2008). The N2
amplitude is thought to index the degree of conflict, with its
amplitude increasing as a function of conflict levels (Li et
al., 2015). P3 was also typically reported to reflect ERP
modulation of conflict process (Frühholz, Godde, Finke, &
Herrmann, 2011; Wang, Li, Zheng, Wang, & Liu, 2014).
By applied the ERP to the two-cannon task, we expected
to find the neural evidence of the conflict processing among
different FORs (EFOR-IFOR, IFOR-IFOR), the parallel
process of multiple IFORs and clarified the conflict
processing among multiple FORs. Our expectation was that,
for the behavioral results, we could replicate our previous
behavioral studies’ results (Nan et al., in press; Tamborello
et al., 2012), which was that RT and error rates (ERR) were
larger in the incongruent conditions of the EFOR-IFOR and
IFOR-IFOR conflicts and there was also an interaction
between them. For the ERP results, the N2 and P3 results
could help to reveal the shared or distinct conflict
processing mechanism of multiple FORs more clearly. We
expected that the amplitude of N2 and P3 would be more
negative in the incongruent conditions of the two conflicts
and there was also an interaction between them.

Method
Participants
Twenty undergraduate students (18–29 years old, average
22.8 years old, 6 women) participated in the present EEG
experiment. All participants reported that they had no
neurological or psychiatric history. All participants were
right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Each participant voluntarily enrolled and signed an
informed consent form prior to the experiments. This study
was approved by the Institute of Psychology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences.

Procedures
Participants were seated comfortably in a dimly lit and
sound-attenuating chamber approximately 80 cm away from
a computer screen (resolution, 1024×768 pixels, vertical
refresh rate, 75 Hz). Stimulus presentation and manual
response measurement were controlled by E-Prime 2.0
(Psychological Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Each trial began with two cannons surrounding eight
colored dots for 1000 ms. Then, the target pellet was
marked by a yellow ring for 1000 ms. Participants were
instructed to press a button on the keyboard (left-“z” for
counter-clockwise or right-“/” for clockwise), as quickly
and accurately as possible, to rotate the target cannon (the
one with the same color as the target pellet) to shoot the
target in the least distance. After the target disappeared, a
fixation cross was presented at the center of the screen for
1000-1300 ms.

EEG Recordings and Offline Processing
The EEG was recorded from 64 scalp sites using Ag/AgCl
electrodes arranged in an elastic cap according to an
extension of the International 10-20 system (NeuroScan
Inc., Herndon, VA). Vertical eye movements were recorded
by two positioned above and below the left eye. The
horizontal electrooculogram was recorded using lateral
electrodes from both eyes. Impedances were below 5 kΩ for
all recording sites. EEG signals were amplified using a
NeuroScan SymAmps2 amplifier with a band-pass of 0.05 –
100 Hz and sampled with 500 Hz.
All scalp electrodes were referenced to the left mastoid
online and were referenced to the average of the left and
right mastoids offline. Each epoch started from 200 ms
before the onset of the stimulus and lasted 800 ms, with the
first 200 ms as the baseline. Trials with errors or trials that
were contaminated with artifacts exceeding ± 100 μV were
excluded from the analysis. The data were averaged for each
condition and then digitally low-pass filtered at 30 Hz (24
dB/octave) with zero phase shift.

Statistical Analysis
Behavioral Data Analysis
Repeated-measures ANOVA and paired-sample t-test were
performed on reaction times (RTs) of correct responses and
error rates (ERs) and evaluated at p < .05. Trials with errors
or with RT beyond three standard deviations were excluded
from the RT analysis. A repeated-measures ANOVA was
conducted for cannon angle effect and target cannon
orientation effect (Figure. 2 B and Table 2), in which the 2 ×
2 factors tested were cannon angle (0°, 180°) and target
cannon orientation (up, down). Bonferroni correction was
used for pair-wise comparisons.

ERP Data Analysis
The ERPs of correct responses were averaged for each
condition. The time window for N2 and P3 was identified

using the following protocol. First, we detected the peak
latencies of all conditions at the midline electrodes (Fz, FCz,
Cz, CPz, and Pz) and calculated the mean of these latencies
for N2 (301 ms) and P3 (561 ms). For the N2 and P3
components, 50-ms and 330-ms time windows were
centered on the mean peak latency, respectively. Therefore,
the cannon angle effect and target cannon orientation effect
were analyzed within 276-326 ms on N2 mean amplitude
and within 396-561 and 561-726 ms on P3 mean amplitude
after stimulus onset.
Separated repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed
on the mean N2 and the two time windows of mean P3,
respectively. The factors cannon angle (0° and 180°), target
cannon orientation (up and down) and electrode (Fz, FCz,
Cz, CPz, and Pz) were used to search for cannon angle
effect and target cannon orientation effect. The significance
level was set at α < .05 for all ANOVAs. The mean number
of trials retained for each condition are listed in the trial
number of Table 1. A two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was calculated for the trial numbers of cannon
angle and target cannon orientation, results showed there
were no significant differences among them. The main
effect of cannon angle: F(1, 19) = 1.19, p > .05, the main
effect of target cannon orientation: F(1, 19) = 1.17, p > .05,
the interaction between them: F(1, 19) = 0.18, p > .05.
These analysis results eliminated the potential influence of
different signal-noise ratios to statistical comparison.

Regarding RTs (Figure 2 and Table 1), there was a
significant main effect of target cannon orientation, F(1, 19)
= 256.74, p < .001, ηp2 = .93, indicating that the RT in the
target cannon point-down condition (697 ± 24 ms) was

cannon angle condition (558 ± 24 ms) was shorter than that
in the 180° cannon angle condition (756 ± 22 ms). The
interaction of the two factors was also significant, F(1, 19) =
6.48, p < .05, ηp2 = .25. Post-hoc analysis showed that target
cannon orientation effect in the 180° condition (89 ± 13 ms)
was larger than target cannon orientation effect in the 0°
condition (68 ± 11 ms), t (1, 19) = 2.55, p < .05.

orientation, F(1, 19) = 22.54, p < .001, ηp2 = .54, indicating
that the ER in the target cannon point-down condition (7.7 ±
1.1%) was larger than that in the target cannon point-up
condition (3.0 ± 0.7%). The main effect of cannon angle and
the interaction of the two factors were not significant.

Figure 4. Three kinds of FOR conflict processing models. The three kinds of models are all parallel models. All of them
showed the IFORs could be represented and processed in parallel that generates two conflicts of IFOR-IFOR and EFORIFOR. The difference is whether there are specific or shared conflict monitoring module and executive control module. The
parallel model (1CM1EC) showed that there was only one conflict monitoring module (CM) and one executive control
module (EC) for both conflicts. The parallel model (2CM1EC) showed that there were two conflict monitoring modules for
each conflict and only one executive control module for both conflicts. The parallel model (2CM2EC) showed that there
were two conflict monitoring modules and two executive control modules for each conflict.
cannon angle and electrode, F(4, 76) =5.96, p < .05, ηp2
= .24, post-hoc analysis showed that the cannon angle effect
was significant at five electrodes, ps < .01, and the largest
difference was at FCz (3.04 ± 0.74 µV). There was a
significant interaction between target cannon orientation and

orientation effect in the 180º cannon angle condition (1.93 ±
0.40 µV) increased and was significant compared to that in
the 0º cannon angle condition (0.67 ± 0.36 µV). No other
significant interactions were obtained.

Discussion
Overall, the findings of the present study suggested that
EFOR-IFOR and IFOR-IFOR conflicts had specific neural
correlates and the process of IFORs was in parallel.
First, behavioral data showed the conflicts of EFORIFOR and IFOR-IFOR, the interaction between them.
Second, the ERP results showed that the independent
cannon angle effect and target cannon orientation effect on
the N2 amplitudes, from 276 to 326 ms, which indicated the
independent conflict monitoring modules for the conflicts of
EFOR-IFOR and IFOR-IFOR. What’s more, the two effects
interacted on the P3 amplitudes, from 561 to 726 ms, which
indicated the shared executive control module for the two
conflicts.
Yang, Nan, Li, and Liu (2015) used stimulus-response
compatible tasks to collect behavioral and ERP data to
support the 2CM1EC model (two domain-specific conflict
monitoring modules and one domain-general executive
control module for the conflicts of stimulus-stimulus and
stimulus-response) of cognitive control for conflict
processing, compared to the 1CM1EC model and 2CM2EC

model. For a comprehensive review, see (Li, Nan, Wang, &
Liu, 2014; Li et al., 2015; Liu, Nan, Wang, & Li, 2013; Liu,
Park, Gu, & Fan, 2010; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al.,
2015).
On the spatial cognition area, we also could hypothesize
three kinds of model for the conflict processing among
different FORs (1CM1EC, 2CM1EC, and 2CM2EC, see
Figure 4). 1CM1EC model shows there is only one general
conflict monitoring module and one executive control for
conflicts of EFOR-IFOR and IFOR-IFOR. The 2CM1EC
model shows there are two specific conflict monitoring
modules for conflicts of EFOR-IFOR and IFOR-IFOR, and
one general executive control module for the two conflicts.
The 2CM2EC model shows there are two specific conflict
monitoring modules and two specific executive control
modules for the two conflicts.
In our task, the behavioral results showed the cannon
angle effect (conflict of IFOR-IFOR), target cannon
orientation effect (conflict of EFOR-IFOR) and the
interaction between them, which supported that the parallel
process of the IFORs and the shared conflict process
mechanism at the behavioral level. The ERP results showed
the independent cannon angle effect and target cannon
orientation effect on the N2 amplitudes, which further
suggests there might be two specific conflict monitoring
modules for the conflicts of EFOR-IFOR and IFOR-IFOR at
the neural level. What’s more, we also found the two
effects , and the interaction between them on the P3
amplitudes. This suggests there might be only one shared
executive control module for these conflicts at the neural
level. In summary, our results supported the 2CM1EC
model for the cognitive control of spatial conflict processing.
In the current two-cannon task, the AFOR is anchored on
the computer screen which has the same direction (point-up)
with the EFOR, so we could not separate the conflict of
AFOR-IFOR and EFOR-IFOR. In the future, we could try
to manipulate the AFOR and observe the interaction of all
kinds of conflict which could be more comprehensive
understand the spatial conflicts processing of FORs.

2794

Conclusion
Our task replicated the previous behavioral results well.
What’s more, the ERP results showed that common and
distinct electrophysiological correlates for EFOR-IFOR and
IFOR-IFOR conflict processing. On the one hand, EFORIFOR and IFOR-IFOR have domain-specific conflict
monitoring modules, as revealed by the independent N2
component. On the other hand, both of them share a
domain-general executive control module, as revealed by
the interaction of P3 component. The conflict of IFORIFOR and the interaction of EFOR-IFOR and IFOR-IFOR
also suggest that the process of different IFORs is in
parallel.`
