Abstract

Time Perception

This study investigates the effects of the social setting on
prospective time estimation, how time is perceived when a task
is performed (i) alone, (ii) with a collaborative, or (iii) with a
competitive partner. N=90 participants were tested (30 in each
condition). Participants performed a concurrent Simon task for
three different durations (15, 30 and 45 seconds) which was
followed by a time reproduction phase. Results revealed a main
effect of social condition. Reproduction ratios in dual
conditions were smaller than in the single condition and also
smaller in the competitive condition compared to the
cooperative condition. The results provide first evidence that
social condition affects time estimation: time “flies” when we
work together, in particular when we compete with a partner,
showing that cognitive and social processes are heavily
intertwined.

Introduction
The passage of time has always captured the curiosity of
humans. As archaeological studies revealed sundials were in
use some 3500 years ago (Vodolazshkaya, 2014). However,
measuring the passage of time with clocks is not the same as
the “feeling” of how much time has passed. Therefore, it has
been suggested that humans have internal and possibly innate
mechanisms for keeping track of time and these mechanisms
have been studied and explained with internal clock models
which facilitate the understanding of how cognitive factors
can affect time estimation (Droit-Volet, 2013).
This study brings together two lines of study in cognitive
science: time perception and joint action. Time perception is
a basic cognitive ability implied in a wide variety of
experimental tasks and daily activities (Grondin, 2010).
Forming joint attention and performing joint action is another
cognitive ability which has recently been the focus of several
studies showing that people’s performance in any task is
heavily affected by joint attention and joint action (Sebanz,
Bekkering, & Knoblich, 2006; Sebanz, Knoblich, & Prinz,
2003; Vesper et al., 2011). Also, studies in the literature
suggest that time perception might be under the influence of
a person’s mood at that time (Droit-Volet & Meck, 2007).
The purpose of this study is to provide an experimental
research paradigm linking the social aspect of the task setting
to participants’ prospective time estimation during that task,
in order to investigate the effects of the social setting of the
task on time perception.

There are dedicated and intrinsic models for time processing
(Ivry & Schlerf, 2008). The dedicated models are modular,
such as the Attentional Gate Model (Block & Zakay, 2006)
or the cerebellar timing hypothesis (Ivry et al., 2002). On the
other hand, intrinsic models suggest that time perception is
distributed in various neural networks instead of a certain part
of the brain (Reutimann et al., 2004).
The Attentional Gate Model contains a pacemaker which
emits pulses continuously on a certain rate, and it can only be
affected by arousal on a small scale. These pulses flow
through an attentional gate, which is regulated by an
executive function that determines whether attentional
resources should be directed to the task at hand or to the
keeping of time, which might be affected by diverting
attentional resources to another task. A switch between the
attentional gate and the counter starts or stops the connection,
and the counter system keeps track of how many pulses have
passed since the beginning of the event and stores that
information in memory. Later, the number of pulses are
retrieved from memory to represent how much time has
passed during the given event. Then the decision on the
amount of time that has passed is based on the latest
information from the counter and the beginning of the
counting of the pulses. The additional attentional mechanism
for the explanation of mistakes in time estimation seen in
humans, especially when there are other attention-demanding
tasks in parallel with time estimation (Block & Zakay, 2006).
The temporal paradigm used in this study is prospective
duration judgment, also called “experienced duration”
(Block, 2014). In this paradigm, participants are aware that
they will perform a time reproduction after some experienced
duration (Zakay & Block, 2004). Participants use their
attentional resources to keep track of time while they are
performing a secondary task during that interval.
In accordance with the Attentional Gate Model (Block &
Zakay, 2006), the amount of attention devoted to keeping
track of time decreases in more demanding secondary tasks,
e.g., executive tasks, compared to easier tasks, which results
in an underestimation of the actual duration of the interval
(Duzcu & Hohenberger, 2014). As the amount of cognitive
load increases, the ratio of reproduced duration to actual
duration decreases, which means that participants tend to
underestimate time (Block, Hancock, & Zakay, 2010). This
finding is explained by the Attentional Gate Model as
follows: the attentional gate is down, because the participant
is focusing on the difficult task at hand, and therefore more
pulses of the pacemaker are missed.

demanding they may perceive time as proceeding even faster
during a competitive joint action task than a cooperative one.

The Simon Task
The Simon task is a spatial compatibility task first described
in a paper by Simon & Rudell (1967). The Simon task is a
two-choice reaction task and stimulus has relevant (e.g.
color) and irrelevant (e.g. location) dimensions. Participants
are instructed to respond according to the relevant dimension
of the stimulus and not to the irrelevant dimension. The
Simon task consists of congruent trials in which the irrelevant
dimension is spatially compatible and incongruent trials in
which the irrelevant dimension is not spatially compatible.
The first true Simon effect was shown in another study by
Simon & Small (1969). The Simon effect is based on the
universal tendency to respond faster when stimulus and
response location overlap, i.e. the congruent condition
(Hommel, 2011).

Method
Participants

Joint Action
People frequently perform an action together, which is called
joint action. The social Simon task is a joint action paradigm
in which participants share a Simon task and respond only to
half of the stimuli, e.g., blue or red stimuli, occurring on
either side of the monitor, respectively. Interestingly, it has
been shown that an individual’s actions in the social Simon
task are represented in the other person’s mind and have an
impact on their actions. Therefore, the social Simon task
results in the same findings as the individual Simon task, i.e.,
people respond faster to a stimulus on their side (“congruent”
condition) as compared to a stimulus on the opposite side
(“incongruent” condition) even if the social Simon task does
not necessitate a spatial reference as in the individual Simon
task. This construction of a mental representation of each
other results in an increase in the amount of cognitive load
(Sebanz, Knoblich & Prinz, 2003).
Previous studies have shown that the increase in the
amount of cognitive load results in underestimation of time
(Block, Hancock & Zakay, 2010) which is in accordance with
the Attentional Gate Model.
The present study brings together time perception and the
social Simon task in a single study. It will broaden our
understanding of how human time perception is affected by
the social setting and the nature of this setting.

Hypotheses
Our hypothesis is that subjects’ time perception during a task
is affected by the social setting of the task. In line with the
Attentional Gate Model (Block & Zakay, 2006), we argue
that joint settings require more attentional resources than the
single setting, since participants co-represent their partners’
task, thus leaving less resources for time estimation. Due to
social facilitation and attention demands, we expect that
subjects will perceive time as proceeding faster during a
joint-action task than in a single person task. Furthermore, the
nature of the social setting – whether cooperative or
competitive – may affect time perception. If subjects
experience competitive settings as even more attention-

A total of 90 participants (42 males, mean age: 25.90,
SD=5.234) were tested in three different groups. The Single
Task group (n=30, 14 males, mean age: 26.03, SD=6.206)
were tested alone whereas the Cooperative Task group (n=30,
14 males, mean age: 25.03, SD=5.442) and the Competitive
Task group (n=30, 14 males, mean age: 26.63, SD=3.819)
were tested in dyads. Dyads always consisted of participants
from the same gender. Participants were recruited through email invitation. They were undergraduate or graduate
students from various METU departments. All participants
were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal
vision. Before the study, ethics approval has been obtained
from METU Human Studies Ethical Committee. All
participants volunteered to join the study and no monetary
reward was offered for participation or performance, since it
might affect time perception (Failing & Theeuwes, 2016).

The Simon Task
A Simon task was performed for three different duration
lengths (15, 30 and 45 seconds) which was followed by a time
reproduction phase. In the single condition, participants were
tested alone and they did all Simon tasks and following time
reproductions themselves. In the joint conditions
(Cooperative and Competitive) participants performed a
social Simon task in which each participant was assigned to
a specific stimulus color and response button. The participant
on the left side was instructed to use only the ‘z’ button and
respond only to red stimuli whereas the participant on the
right side was instructed to use only the ‘.’ button and respond
only to blue stimuli. These buttons were chosen because on a
Turkish Q-style keyboard they are the furthest apart
horizontally. All participants used their right hand index
finger to respond in order to achieve the same setting between
dyads, since literature in the field suggests that the position
of hands during a social Simon task might affect performance
(Liepelt, 2014; Welsh, 2009). Stimuli occurred on the left and
right side of the screen, randomly.
Participants in all conditions were told that they would
receive points for their correct responses in the Simon task.
In the single condition they were told that their points would
be compared with other participants individually, in the
cooperative condition they were told that their points would
be calculated as a team and compared with other teams, and
in the competitive condition they were told that each
participant’s points would be compared with the other
participant in the dyad.

Time Reproduction Task
Before the reproduction phase begun, participants were
informed through a message on the screen that they were
going to see a big square in the middle of the screen,

3424

indicating the time reproduction phase has begun.
Participants used the same button for the time reproduction
phase, depending on the color of the big square, i.e. ‘z’ for
red and ‘.’ for blue.
They were instructed to wait as long as they thought the
previous trial has lasted and then press the button to indicate
the end of the duration. A message on the screen warned the
participants before each time reproduction phase, which
stayed on the screen for 2 seconds and the time reproduction
has begun automatically afterwards. In the cooperative and
competitive conditions, participants were instructed that if
the big square was in the color they were responsible for, they
were assigned to do the time reproduction. In other words, if
it was red, the left participant did time reproduction and if it
was blue, the right participant did time reproduction. The
order of the color was random and balanced between
subjects. Participants in all conditions performed a total of 18
time reproductions (6 of each duration length).

The Questionnaire
After the test, participants were presented with a short
questionnaire. The first 5 questions were presented to
participants in all social conditions and they were regarding
their mood and self-assessment during the trials. The second
part of the questionnaire, which consisted of questions 6 to 9,
were only presented to participants in the joint conditions and
were regarding partner-assessment and social warmth. There
was also a 10th question which was different amongst the two
social conditions. The participants in the cooperative
condition were asked to evaluate the quality of their
cooperation whereas the participants in the competitive
condition were asked the quality of their competition.

Results
Time Reproduction
The first analysis was performed on Duration Ratios
(Reproduced Duration/Objective Duration). The main effect
of duration was statistically significant (F(2,174)=174.64,
p<.001, ηp2=.67). Simple contrasts revealed that reproduction
ratios were smaller for long durations (M=.48, SE=.014) as
compared to moderate (M=.53, SE=.015) (F(1,87)=49.93,
p<.001, ηp2=.37) and short durations (M=.65, SE=.015)
(F(1,87)=225.26, p<.001, ηp2=.72), indicating that long
durations were underestimated more than moderate and short
durations. There was a main effect of task setting
(F(2,87)=14.59, p<.001, ηp2=.25). Helmert contrasts revealed
a significant difference when the single task setting was
compared to both dual task settings (F(1,88)=18.30, p<.001,
ηp2=.17). The reproduction ratios in the dual task settings
were smaller (M=.51, SE=.022) than in the single task setting
(M=.64, SE=.027), indicating that duration was
underestimated more by the participants in the dual task
settings as compared to the single task setting. Also, the
difference between the cooperative task setting compared to
the competitive task setting was significant (F(1,58)=11.42,
p=.001, ηp2=.16). Reproduction ratios were smaller, hence
durations were more underestimated in the competitive task
setting (M=.46, SE=.023) compared to the cooperative task
setting (M=.56, SE=.019) (see Figure 1).

Statistical Analysis
Collected data was analyzed in three different sections: Time
Reproduction, the Simon Task and the Questionnaire. For the
time reproduction, 3x3 mixed ANOVAs with social task
setting (individual, cooperative, competitive) as a betweensubjects variable and duration (short, medium, long) as a
within-subjects variable were conducted on three dependent
measures: Duration Ratio (Reproduced Duration/Objective
Duration), Absolute Error/Actual Duration and Coefficient of
Variation (SD/Mean).
For the Simon task, response times for compatible vs
incompatible trials were analyzed as a dependent measure.
For the analysis of the questionnaire, presented options
were given values from 1 to 5, with the most negative option
being 1 and the most positive option being 5. The first 5
questions, which were presented to all participants, were
analyzed with a One-way ANOVA for the 3 task settings
(Single, Cooperative, Competitive). The second part, which
consisted of questions 6-10, were only presented to the
participants in dual task settings. A One-way ANOVA for the
2 task settings (Cooperative, Competitive) was carried out for
each question.

across duration lengths for all task settings. (Error bars
represent SE and the numbers above the bars show the values
of absolute time durations)
The analysis of the absolute errors showed that the main
effect of duration was significant (F(2,174)=157.77, p<.001,
ηp2=.64). Error ratios were higher, indicating that the
inaccuracy of participants time estimation was higher in the
long duration (M=.52, SE=.13) than the short (M=.36,
SE=.12) and the medium duration (M=.47, SE=.14). The
setting of the task had a significant effect on accuracy
(F(2,87)=15.38, p<.001, ηp2=.26). The first Helmert contrast
revealed that participants in both dual task settings showed
higher error ratios (F(1,88)=18.56, p<.001, ηp2=.17), hence

3425

were less accurate (M=.49, SE=.018) compared to the single
task setting (M=.38, SE=.022). Moreover, as the second
Helmert contrast revealed (F(1,58)=11.42, p=.001, ηp2=.16),
error ratios were higher, hence accuracy was lower in the
competitive task setting (M=.54, SE=.016) than the
cooperative task setting (M=.44, SE=.021). The effect of the
interaction between duration and task setting was not
significant (F(2,87)=1.45, p>.05, ηp2=.03) (see Figure 2).

and incongruent trials across task settings. (Error bars
represent SE and the numbers above the bars show mean
response times)

Figure 2: Mean Values of Absolute Error/Objective
Duration across duration lengths for all task settings. (Error
bars represent SE and the numbers above the bars show the
values of absolute errors)
The third analysis was carried out on the Coefficient of
Variation, which is calculated by dividing the standard
deviation of reproduced durations by the mean reproduced
durations. The CV is regarded as a very important variable in
Scalar Expectancy Theory because a stable CV is a sign of
the scalar invariance of subjective estimation of time across
different duration lengths (Church & Meck, 2003). The
effects of duration (F(2,174)=1.58, p>.05, ηp2=.02) as well as
task setting on the CV were not significant (F(2,87)=2.7,
p>.05, ηp2=.06), indicating scalar invariance, as expected.

In order to assess whether the side at which the participant
was seated had any effect on the Simon task, a 2
(Congruency: Congruent, Incongruent) x 2 (Participant’s
Side: Left, Right) Mixed ANOVA was conducted on
response times. Participant’s side was a between-subject
factor and congruency a within-subject factor. This analysis
revealed that congruency had a significant effect
(F(1,58)=62.47, p<.001, ηp2=.52). Participants’ response
times were significantly lower in the congruent condition
(M=522.32, SE=3.58) in comparison to the incongruent
condition (M=530.59, SE=3.60). Participant’s side did not
have a significant effect on overall response times
(F(1,58)=0.27, p=.869, ηp2=.00), i.e., participants’ reaction
speed was similar on both the left (M=527.05, SE=5.17) and
the right side (M=525.87, SE=4.99). The interaction effect
between congruency and side was also not significant
(F(1,58)=1.00, p=.321, ηp2=.02). Participants on both sides
were faster in the congruent condition than in the incongruent
condition, which shows that the Simon Effect was observed
in participants on both sides (see Figure 4).

The Simon Task
The analysis of the Simon task revealed that congruency had
a significant effect (F(1,87)=101.03, p<.001, ηp2=.54).
Response times were significantly shorter in the congruent
condition (M=525.66, SE=2.77) in comparison to the
incongruent condition (M=533.21, SE=2.79) (see Figure 3).
This difference amounts to the “Simon effect”. Task setting
did not have a significant effect on overall response times
(F(2,87)=1.53, p>.05, ηp2=.03): participants’ reaction speed
was similar in single (M=535.39, SE=4.29), cooperative
(M=529.35, SE=5.79) and competitive (M=523.57, SE=4.18)
task settings. The interaction effect between congruency and
task setting was not significant (F(2,87)=2.24, p>.05,
ηp2=.05). Participants in all task settings were faster in the
congruent condition than in the incongruent condition.
Overall, these results revealed that the Simon effect was not
affected by the various task settings, indicating that the
primary time estimation task did not interfere with the
secondary, concurrent task.

The Questionnaire
The analysis of the first five questions revealed that main
effects were not significant for enjoyment/boredom during
the trial (F(2,87)=.242, p=.785), excitement (F(2,87)=.079,
p=.925), pressure (F(2,87)=.706, p=.496), self-assessment
for the Simon task (F(2,87)=1.375, p=.258) and selfassessment for the time reproduction task (F(2,87)=1.457,
p=.239).
The analysis of the second part of the questionnaire
revealed that main effects were not significant for questions
6 to 9: partner-assessment for the Simon task (F(1,58)=0,
p=1), partner-assessment for the time reproduction task
(F(1,58)=.887, p=.350), friendliness towards partner
(F(1,58)=.267, p=.526) and social warmth (F(1,58)=0, p=1).
The results of the 10th question on the quality of their
cooperation/competition, revealed a significant main effect
(F(1,58)=10.401, p=.002). Participants in the Cooperative
task setting assessed their cooperation with a higher value
(M=3.83, SD=.87) than participants in the Competitive task
setting assessed their competition (M=2.90, SD=1.32). This
means that cooperative dyads reported to feel more as a team,
compared to competitive dyads which reported to feel more
as rivals.

Discussion
The results of this study show that there is a strong relation
between the social setting of a concurrent executive task and
the subjectively perceived duration. Participants estimated
the actual duration of the task to be shorter in the joint task
settings compared to the single task setting. Also, the nature
of the joint action had an impact on the amount of this
underestimation, as participants in the competitive task
setting underestimated time more in comparison to the
participants in the cooperative task setting. These findings are
in accordance with previous studies (Dolk et al., 2011; Ford
& Aberdein, 2015; Vesper et al., 2011; Vlainic et al., 2010)
showing that joint-action tasks affect cognitive performance.
In these studies, the effect concerned their behavior in the
Simon task, where a social Simon effect occurred. In our task,
however, the social Simon effect is not in the focus of our
attention. We were primarily interested in the effect of joint
action on the primary task, i.e., the time perception task.
The underestimation of the actual duration can be
explained with the Attentional Gate Model (Block & Zakay,
2006). Previous studies (Sebanz, Bekkering, & Knoblich,
2006; Sebanz, Knoblich & Prinz, 2003) have shown that
when two or more people are performing a task together, they
need to create a mental representation of their partner’s part
of the task, which requires attentional resources to be shifted
towards this demanding task. Additionally, participants in the
joint task settings had higher cognitive load due to inhibiting
their response when the stimulus on the screen was the color
of their partner and it was a no-go trial for them, whereas
participants in the individual task setting always had a gotrial since they responded to both colors, and only had to keep
track of which button to respond. This means that participants
in the joint task settings also had an increase in cognitive load

caused by task switching. Furthermore, participants in the
joint task settings had to monitor their partner’s responses as
well, since their score contributed to the outcome in dual
conditions.
Since cognitive load is high and attention is focused on
both the executive task and the mental representation of the
partner in dual task conditions, the Attentional Gate is low,
i.e., little attention is left to keep track of time, which results
in a shorter experienced duration. The attention-depleting
effect of executive tasks and the underestimation caused by it
is well documented in the literature (Block, Hancock &
Zakay, 2010; Duzcu & Hohenberger, 2014). Here, we have
shown that also the social task setting affects this attentional
mechanism.
Another possible explanation for the decrease in time
estimation observed in the social task settings in comparison
to the single task setting might be the effect of the “switch”
part of the Attentional Gate Model which determines when
attending to the passage of time starts and ends. It might be
that when the participant is not acting herself but the partner
is acting, these parts are “cut out” of her time experience by
the closing of the switch. The switch would only open again
when it’s the subject’s turn again. However, it is not possible
to explain the difference between cooperative and
competitive task groups with this explanation whereas the
difference in cognitive load can explain both results.
Previous studies in the field (Decety et al., 2004; Ruissen
& de Bruijn, 2016) showed that, although both cooperation
and competition result in self-other integration, participants
in the competitive condition also spend attentional resources
on keeping track of the differences between themselves and
the other participant in the dyad. Participants in our study had
to manage different cognitive loads according to the social
condition: Cooperative dyads only needed to follow their
cumulative scores, but participants in the competitive
condition needed to follow their performance and their
partner’s performance as separate information, in order to
predict who was more successful. This results in a higher
cognitive load and thus more severe underestimation of time.
The literature (Droit-Volet & Gil, 2016; Droit-Volet &
Meck, 2007) suggests that mood has a certain effect on time
estimation. However, our questionnaire did not reveal any
difference in participants’ mood during the experiment,
despite the significant contrast in their time estimation. This
result suggests that the underestimations were caused by the
depletion of attentional resources rather than by the effect of
mood on the pacemaker.
Our results have also revealed a significant congruency
effect in the Simon task, individual and social, which is in
line with the vast literature on the Simon task (Hommel,
2011). The results also indicated that there was no difference
in reaction times between participants who were seated on the
right side and the left side, which shows that seating did not
have any effect on participants’ performance.

Conclusion
The results of this study provide first evidence that social
condition affects time estimation: people perceive time to
flow faster when they are performing a task with someone in
comparison to when they are alone, and even faster when the
nature of the social condition is competitive rather than
cooperative. This finding can be applied to daily life in
education and at the workplace, by supporting joint action
over individual work. Our findings also add to the growing
literature on “joint action” (Sebanz, Bekkering, & Knoblich,
2006), showing that there is a strong link between cognitive
and social processes. This study has methodological
implications in terms of promoting the use of joint settings in
cognitive science.
For future studies, experiments that feature another task
with similar cognitive load but no social setting would
provide information in order to distinguish between the effect
of cognitive load and the effect of sociality on time
perception. Also, different social manipulations on the same
task can provide further explanation whether the difference
in time perception is the result of the attentional gate, the
switch or the arousal.
