Abstract

relatively fast time scale of word selection is nested within
and constrained by the slower time scale of idea generation.
Singular ideas are further nested within the subtopics and
global topic of the essay that change at even slower rates.
Beyond these examples, nesting can continue at both faster
and slower time scales. Rapidly changing physiological
processes influence and support the act of writing that
would not be possible without a lifetime of learning or the
evolution of a language within a culture. Thus, even the
seemingly simple act of typing one sentence of an essay
may entail complex interactions of any number of processes,
each with its own characteristic rate of evolution. The
implication is that language production involves the
coordination of numerous systems over many different time
scales. Our assumption is that the act of text production (i.e.,
typing an essay) provides a window into ongoing cognitive
processes (Pinet, Ziegler, & Alario, 2016). As such, we
expect that keystroke dynamics will reveal the multiplynested character of text production.

Language entails many nested time scales, ranging from the
relatively slow scale of cultural evolution to the rapid scale of
individual cognition. The nested, multiscale nature of
language implies that even simple acts of text production,
such as typing a sentence, entail complex interactions
involving multiple concurrent processes. As such, text
production may have much in common with other cognitive
phenomena thought to emerge from multiplicative
interactions across temporal scales, namely those that exhibit
fractal properties. We investigated the relationship between
fractal scaling and the quality of produced text. Participants
(N=131) wrote essays while their keystrokes were recorded.
Fractal analyses were then performed on time series of
interkeystroke intervals (IKIs). Results showed that fractal
properties characterizing IKIs positively predicted expert
ratings of essay quality, even after accounting for essay
length. The results support our hypotheses concerning
multiscale coordination and text production.

Multiscale Interactions in Human Behavior

Introduction
Recent theoretical and empirical work characterizes
language as a complex, dynamic system that involves the
coordination of multiple nested time scales (Dale, Kello, &
Schoenemann,
2016;
Rączaszek-Leonardi,
2010;
Rączaszek-Leonardi & Kelso, 2008). Consider three time
scales that have been highlighted extensively in the
literature. Language can evolve on a relatively slow scale
along with changes in cultures and significant historical
events. On a faster scale, language can be altered throughout
an individual’s life, based on their experiences and
knowledge. Lastly, language can change at more rapid
scales in response to cognitive events that can span days,
hours, or mere fractions of a second.
These time scales span several orders of magnitude and
paint a complex picture of language. The picture is further
complicated because each of the time scales implicates
different
systems
(e.g.,
cultural,
interpersonal,
physiological) and suggests that language processes should
be studied as complex, dynamical systems. The current
work explores this idea in the context of text-based language
production. We examine whether dynamic analyses of
typing behaviors during essay writing provide empirical
support for the notion of writing as a complex, dynamical
system.
The nested, multiscale character of text production is
apparent in the simple example of typing an essay. The

A wide range of cognitive phenomena have been described
as emerging from the interaction of multiply-nested time
scales (Ihlen & Vereijken, 2010). The principle evidence for
that claim is the observation of fractal scaling. Fractal
scaling typically refers to two qualities: long-range
autocorrelation and scale dependence. Long-range
autocorrelation implies that time series observations exhibit
significant correlations over large timespans (Beran, 1994).
That is, an observation made at one point in time is related
to subsequent observations that extend into the future. Scale
dependence suggests that measurements of time series (e.g.,
variance) depend on the temporal scale at which they are
measured (Mandelbrot & Van Ness, 1968).
There are numerous examples of behavioral time series
known to exhibit fractal scaling: reaction times (Gilden,
Thornton, & Mallon, 1995; Van Orden et al., 2003), time
estimation (Wagenmakers et al., 2004), eye movements
(Stephen & Anastas, 2011), hand movements (Anastas,
Stephen, & Dixon, 2011; Stephen, Arzamarksi, & Michaels,
2010), arm movements (Chen, Ding, & Kelso, 1997),
postural corrections (Collins & DeLuca, 1993), and various
forms of tool-use (Likens, Fine, Amazeen, & Amazeen,
2015; Nonaka & Bril, 2014).
Much of the work on fractal scaling in cognition has
emphasized interaction across scales as its primary
theoretical contribution (Ihlen & Vereijken, 2010; Kelty-

2573

Stephen & Wallot, in press). The basic idea is that the rich
structure observed in behavioral time series is the product of
many simultaneously occurring processes (e.g., physical,
cognitive). Each process exists on its own time scale, with
effects of slower time scales multiplicatively cascading to
faster and faster time scales. As such, fractal scaling reflects
on-the-fly cognitive organization during tasks (Van Orden et
al., 2003; Wallot, Hollis, & van Rooij, 2013). Further,
variability in fractal properties reflects the flexibility and
adaptability in typical cognitive tasks necessary for
coordination across those levels (Anastas et al., 2011).
If fractal scaling reflects the flexibility and adaptability
that stems from multiscale coordination, then reliable
relationships should exist between fractal scaling and other
meaningful aspects of behavior. The literature contains
several such examples. Visual search is faster when eye
movements exhibit fractal properties (Stephen & Anastas,
2011). Fractal variability in hand movements predicts better
perceptual estimates (Stephen et al., 2010). Moreover,
fractal patterns distinguish between various forms of skilled
and non-skilled behavior (e.g., Nonaka & Bril, 2014). These
examples are not exhaustive but hint at the large number of
skillful behaviors that exhibit fractal characteristics.
The current work explores the idea that fractal scaling
might also reflect the multiscale coordination involved in
the skilled production of text. Across domains, the evidence
implies being skilled means adapting to task demands, and
fractal scaling characterizes flexibility (Gorman et al., 2010;
Nonaka & Bril, 2014). The observation of flexibility in
skilled text production (Allen, Snow, & McNamara, 2016)
leads to the hypothesis that fractal scaling will reveal the
flexibility required from the nested, multiscale act of
composition. That is, we expect more skilled text production
will be characterized by fractal variability.
We are not aware of any studies that have examined the
time course of text production for evidence of fractal
scaling; however, work related to reading and skilled typing
provides some bases for exploration (e.g., Wallot &
Grabowski, 2013; Wallot et al., 2013; Wijnants et al., 2012).
For example, Wijnants and colleagues (2012) showed that
the presence of fractal scaling in word naming times
distinguished dyslexic and non-dyslexic readers. They also
found a positive relationship between fractal scaling and
reading fluency. Another study involving skilled typing
suggests that fractal properties may depend on task
complexity/difficulty (Wallot & Grabowski, 2013). The
relevant finding in that study was that there was greater
fractal variability over time when participants typed a set of
directions than when they typed simple lyrics from memory
or simply copied text.

Current Study
This study investigates how fractal properties in keystroke
logs are related to the quality of written text. Participants
wrote timed, prompt-based argumentative essays while their
keystrokes were recorded. Time series were constructed
from the latencies between keystrokes and analyzed by

fractal analysis. Essays were scored by experts on holistic
quality and analytical subscales. This study is exploratory
and the first of its kind; nonetheless, our general expectation
is that, like performance on other tasks, fractal properties
will serve as reliable predictors of essay quality.

Method
Participants Undergraduate students (N = 131, Female =
58, mean age = 19.8 years) were recruited from a large
university in the United States. Students participated in the
study in exchange for course credit.
Procedure Participants wrote a timed (25-minutes), promptbased, argumentative essay. Essay prompts were similar in
structure to Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) prompts in that
participants were asked to take either a supporting or
contrary position on a given topic. Keystrokes and their
respective time stamps were recorded while students
composed their essays. Unsurprisingly, participants varied
considerably in the number of keystrokes they produced (M
= 3,385.40, SD = 1,107.03). To prevent bias, only the first
999 keystrokes were retained for further analysis,
corresponding to lowest number of keystrokes in our
sample. No other keystrokes (e.g., backspaces) were
omitted. Keystroke timestamp series were then differenced
to obtain time series of interkeystroke intervals (IKIs).
Mouse movements were not recorded.
Text Analyses Pairs of raters evaluated the essays based on
holistic quality and analytic subscales. Raters received
extensive training before scoring and received compensation
for their time. Holistic scores ranged from one (minimum)
to six (maximum) and were based on a standardized rubric
used in the assessment of SAT essays. Interrater reliability
was good (r = 0.75). Raters were instructed to treat the
distance between points (e.g., 1-2, 3-4, 4-5) as equal. The
nine subscales, also based on a 6-point scales, were:
Introduction. (M = 3.97, SD = 0.96) Demonstrates
mastery in meeting the goals of an introduction (e.g.,
presenting a topic, providing a purpose, clearly stating a
thesis, previewing arguments).
Body. (M = 4.08, SD = 0.90) Demonstrates mastery in
meeting the goals of body arguments (e.g., transition
between arguments, using topic sentences, supporting
arguments with evidence, and maintaining a flow
throughout the arguments).
Conclusion. (M = 3.19, SD = 1.32) Demonstrates mastery
in meeting the goals of a conclusion (e.g., summarizing the
essay, re-establishing the significance of discussion,
capturing the reader’s attention, and effectively closing the
essay).
Organization. (M = 3.86, SD = 0.98) Follows a logical
structure, beginning with the introduction, through the
arguments and evidence presented in the body arguments,
and to the conclusion.
On-Topic/Global Cohesion. (M = 4.13, SD = 0.85)
Details presented throughout the essay support the thesis

and do not stray from the prompt and the main ideas and
organizing principles presented in the introduction.
Grammar, Syntax, & Mechanics. (M = 3.70, SD = 0.79)
Employs correct Standard American English, avoiding
errors in grammar, syntax, and mechanics; the essay
conveys strong control of the standard conventions of
writing.
Voice. (M = 4.09, SD = 0.76) The writer is expressive,
engaging, and sincere, with a strong sense of audience.
Word Choice. (M = 4.07, SD = 0.71) Word choice is
precise and effective.
Sentence Structure. (M = 4.06, SD = 0.75) Sentence
patterns are varied effectively, enhancing the quality of the
essay.
Fractal Analysis Fractal analysis comes in two forms,
monofractal analysis and multifractal analysis, both of
which were performed on the IKI time series. The goal of
monofractal analysis is to understand how variability
depends on scale (e.g., Eke, Herman, Kocsis, & Kozak,
2002). In general, evaluating monofractality means
estimation of scaling exponents from the relationship, F2(s)
~ sH where H is the Hurst exponent, and F2(s) is a measure
of fluctuation. Being a singular measure, the Hurst exponent
provides a measure of typical scaling behavior in a time
series. Moreover, H ranges from zero to one and has useful
interpretive ranges (Collins & DeLuca, 1993; Gorman et al.,
2010). When H = 0.5, the time series exhibits random
variation. When H > 0.5, the series contains long-range
autocorrelation, and when H < 0.5, the series exhibits longrange anticorrelation such that small values generally follow
large values and vice versa. Many series have been shown to
require not one but a spectrum of exponents to characterize
their variability (Ihlen & Vereijken, 2010; Kantelhardt et al.,
2002). Hence, the goal of multifractal analysis is to
determine whether fractal scaling is fixed across time; that
is, whether a time series exhibits multifractality
(Kantelhardt et al., 2002).
We used Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
(MFDFA; Kantelhardt et al., 2002) to evaluate both
monofractal and multifractal properties in IKIs. The
outcome of MFDFA is the multifractal spectrum. MFDFA
is the generalization of Detrended Fluctuation analysis
(DFA) and has been used in diverse literature to characterize
time-varying structure (Kantelhardt et al., 2002; Peng et al.,
1994). The MFDFA procedure consists of five steps. The
first step is to create the profile by integrating over a meancentered time series. In a second step, the time series of
length, N, is divided into Ns = int(N/s) non-overlapping bins,
such that each bin contains s observations. To compensate
for Ns often being a non-integer multiple of s, the binning
procedure is performed twice by starting from each end of
the time series. The result partitions the time series into 2Ns
bins. In a third step, data in each bin is fit with a least
squares regression line that is subtracted from the binned
data to obtain local residuals. The bin-wise residuals are
squared and averaged to obtain a measure of variance within

each segment, v. The fourth step averages over all the bins
to obtain the qth order fluctuation function as captured in

where F2(v,s) is the variance calculated in Step 3 and q takes
on both positive and negative values. Steps 2 through 4 are
repeated for several s, increasing s by a power. The current
work used a fractional power (11/10) for varying s which
allowed for a larger range of scales over which scaling
estimates were made. The maximum s was ≤ N/4. Step 5
evaluates scaling behavior by performing a log-log
regression of Fq(s) on s for each value of q. We used 101
values of q, ranging from -3 to 3. When scaling properties
are present, the result from Step 5 is a linear slope equal to
the q-order Hurst exponent, H(q). When q = 2, the
procedure is equivalent to standard DFA. H(q) can then be
used to estimate the width of the multifractal spectrum
dh(q). In contrast H, dh(q) provides a measure of the
variability in scaling over time.

Results
Hierarchical multiple regression was used to explore the
relations between the fractal properties in IKIs (i.e., H,
dh(q)) and holistic essay scores (M = 3.85, SD = 0.89)1.
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the predictor
variables used in constructing regression models.

In addition to fractal properties, we included the total
number of words (NW) in each essay as a predictor in the
regression model because of the known positive relationship
between essay length and essay quality (e.g., McNamara,
Crossley, & Roscoe, 2013; McNamara, Crossley, Roscoe,
Allen, & Dai, 2015). Predictors were checked for
multicollinearity and all variance inflation factors were less
than 2 (VIFNW =1.09; VIFH = 1.21; VIFdh(q) = 1.26),
indicating that multicollinearity was not a concern. Note
that, NW, H, and dh(q) were converted to z-scores to aid in
interpretation. This was especially crucial in the case of H as
its theoretical domain is (0, 1). NW was entered in the first
model step; H and dh(q) were both entered in the second
model step. As expected, the initial model was significant, β
= 0.47, R2 = 0.28, p < 0.001; however our interest was in
characterizing whether fractal properties predicted essay
quality over and above NW. The results showed that fractal
properties improved model fit, F(2,127) = 6.68, p < 0.01, R2
= 0.35. As expected NW was a significant predictor such
that a one standard deviation increase in essay length
predicted a 0.54 increase in holistic score, t(127) = 8.09, p <
1

We also estimated models that included polynomial terms.
However, none of the polynomial models improved model fit and
were not reported here.

0.001. After controlling for NW, the model also revealed
that a one standard deviation increase in H predicted a 0.21
increase in holistic score, t(127) = 2.92, p < 0.01.
Furthermore, a one standard deviation increase in dh(q)
predicted a 0.29 increase in holistic score, t(127) = 3.19, p <
0.01.
Following the analysis of holistic essay scores, nine
additional sets of regression models were fit predicting each
subscale from NW, H, and dh(q). The modeling strategy for
these additional models was the same as for overall essay
quality. A summary of those models appears in Table 2. The
table shows that fractal properties explain significant
variance for seven out of nine subscales, with Conclusion
and Organization being the exceptions. Of note is the fact
that, for several outcomes, the fractal properties explain
more than twice the variance explained by NW.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated how the multiscale
characteristics of text production relate to essay quality. In
general, we found that the Hurst exponent was a positive
predictor of holistic essay quality and analytical scores.
Similarly, we found that broader multifractal spectra
predicted better quality essays, overall, and on several
analytical subscales. The remainder of the discussion is
structured as follows: First, we give an overview and basic
interpretation of the scaling behavior observed for IKIs
during essay production. Second, we speculate on how those
interpretations inform patterns of prediction observed with
respect to essay quality. Lastly, we offer ideas for potential
applications and future research.
Scaling Properties in IKIs
We found that IKIs in this study were characterized by
global H close to the value typical of random variation (i.e.,
H = 0.50). The observed mean of H was surprising given the
prevalence with which Hs indicative of long-range
correlation (i.e., H > 0.5) have been observed in other tasks
(Kello et al., 2010). The result was further surprising

because keystrokes observed during typing tasks have been
previously characterized as being anti-correlated, where H <
0.5 (Wallot & Grabowski, 2013). One possible reason for
the difference in results is those authors’ use of power
spectral density to estimate H (labeled α in that study).
Simulation work has shown power spectral density
underestimates H (Delignières et al., 2006). The reason for
those differences may be the method used to estimate H.
A more likely and substantive reason relates to nature of
the tasks used in each study. In Wallot and Grabowski
(2013), participants performed one of three relatively simple
tasks: type a nursery rhyme from memory; copy text from a
page; and generate a novel set of directions from school to
home. The latter condition was the closest to essay writing
but still differs substantially in complexity and difficulty,
factors known affect the scaling properties in basic motor
control tasks and complex tasks like steering (e.g., Chen et
al., 2001; Likens et al., 2015). Writing a timed essay is
arguably more difficult and more complex than giving
familiar directions. Perhaps, then, the Hurst exponents we
observed in this study reflect those differences in task
difficulty. The results concerning dh(q) lends further, albeit
tentative, support for that conclusion.
The trend across tasks observed in Wallot and Grabowski
(2013) permits cautious speculation about the meaning of
spectral widths within the current context. Note that a direct
comparison between the widths we observed and those in
Wallot and Grabowski is not possible because they used a
wavelet form of multifractal analysis, and different methods
are known to produce different widths (Ihlen & Vereijken,
2013). In Wallot and Grabowski, the multifractal spectrum
width increased as a function of task complexity, with the
generative task producing the broadest spectrum. Similar
results have also been reported in the motor control and
social coordination literatures where an increase in task
difficulty has been associated with widening dh(q) (e.g.,
Davis, Brooks, & Dixon, 2016; Romero, Coey, Beach, &
Richardson, 2013). A reasonable conclusion is that the
relatively broad spectra we observed reflect the difficulty
inherent in writing a timed essay.
Unlike H, the multifractal spectrum does not have the
same useful interpretive indices concerning long range
correlation and randomness. However, a few words are
possible concerning why task complexity or task difficulty
would affect the width of the multifractal spectrum. The
multifractal spectrum provides a summary of scaling
behaviors that evolve over time (Ihlen & Vereijken, 2013;
Kantelhardt et al., 2002). If the Hurst exponent were
sufficient to describe the scaling behavior present in the IKI
time series, then one would expect a narrow spectrum – a
time-invariant monofractal process. Instead, we observed
broad multifractal spectra that are more consistent with
interpretation of a time-varying multifractal process. Timevarying scaling behavior is thought to reflect the ongoing
dynamics in complex, dynamical systems that range from
individual physiological processes to entire human teams
(Likens et al., 2014). Time-varying scaling behavior in the

2576

IKIs might reflect changes in cognitive state or changes in
strategy that accompany the multiscale coordination
involved in writing an essay (e.g., Stephen et al., 2009).
That idea is elaborated in the following section in the
context of essay quality.
Scaling Properties as Predictors of Essay Quality
We have suggested that changes in scaling behavior may
reflect changes in cognitive state or strategy. If so, then a
broader multifractal spectrum could reflect flexibility in
writing. Multifractal scaling is synonymous with flexibility
and adaptability in other contexts (e.g., Collins & De Luca,
1993), and flexibility in the use of cohesive devices (i.e.,
flexibility in writing) predicts higher quality essays (e.g.,
Allen et al., 2016; Snow et al., 2015). The implication is: if
multifractal scaling reflects flexibility in writing, then wider
multifractal spectra may also indicate higher quality essays.
The current findings seem to support such reasoning.
Results from regression analyses suggest fractal properties
positively predict overall essay quality as well as quality on
analytical subscales.
Another notable feature of the regression analyses was
that dh(q) did not predict the quality of either the Body or
Conclusion. As a potential explanation of those results, we
refer to our data preparation steps. The time series in our
sample were truncated to accommodate participants with
short essays. Given the average length of intact series was
over three times the length of the truncated series we
analyzed, there is a strong possibility the fractal analyses did
not equally represent Body and Conclusion aspects of text.
If true, then perhaps dh(q) did not adequately capture
variability with respect to Body and Conclusion sections. In
addition, neither H nor dh(q) predicted the organization
subscale. A similar interpretation could be made concerning
the length of the time series analyzed with respect to the
length of a typical essay in our sample.
Applications and Future Directions
In this study, we have shown for the first time that fractal
properties measured while writing an essay predict essay
quality. Being the first of its kind, we have interpreted the
results cautiously. However, the results are promising and
suggest opportunities for future research and applications.
One promising area of research pertains to flexibility and
adaptability in writing. As already discussed, multifractal
scaling may suggest flexibility and adaptability in writing. If
so, then it should be possible to link multifractal
characteristics with other aspects of writing flexibility
(Allen et al., 2016; Snow et al., 2015). In those studies,
flexibility was characterized over several essays; however,
if flexibility is important on the timescales of days and
weeks, then flexibility should also be important within the
context of a single essay. If so, then the fractal properties of
keystrokes may also relate to the flexibility at those slower
time scales.
Another related area of investigation involves the use of
fractal properties in applied settings. The results of the

current study, if replicable, could inform applied educational
settings such as those involving learning analytics and
automated writing evaluation systems. The analyses we
have presented here are algorithmically efficient enough to
be implemented in real time. Real-time assessment of fractal
properties is promising on several fronts. Real-time fractal
properties could be monitored by instructors for early signs
of writing difficulty and provide faster, targeted feedback.
The same notion could apply within automated writing
evaluation systems to augment automated feedback systems.
Lastly, the methods we have presented are not limited to
the analysis of keystrokes. The use of physiological
measurements and various movement registration devices is
becoming more common in applied literature on intelligent
tutoring systems (D’Mello, Picard, & Graesser, 2007).
Fractal analyses have proven beneficial in other settings
involving physiological data, primarily because of
relationship between fractality and flexibility (e.g., Chen et
al., 2001; Ivanov et al., 2001). An open, empirical question
is whether fractal analysis of physiological data may reveal
flexibility in intentional forms of behavior. In conclusion,
we have demonstrated that text production exhibits scaling
properties like those observed in other cognitive
phenomena. In doing so, we have also supported the idea
that language is a complex, dynamical system involving
coordination across many nested time scales. Going
forward, our goal will be to further articulate time scales
relevant to text production.
