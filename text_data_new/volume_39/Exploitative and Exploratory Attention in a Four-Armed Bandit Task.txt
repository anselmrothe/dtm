Abstract
structure is generally stochastic, with the value of each arm
changing gradually over time (e.g., Daw et al., 2006;
Laureiro-Martinez et al., 2015). The key measurement of
this task is how often participants choose the arm which
gives the highest observed pay-off. Generally, a participant
is considered to be “exploiting” an arm if they choose the
arm with the highest observed pay-off, while they are
considered to be “exploring” when making any other choice
(Knox et al., 2012).

When making decisions, we are often forced to choose
between something safe we have chosen before, and
something unknown to us that is inherently risky, but may
provide a better long-term outcome. This problem is known as
the Exploitation-Exploration (EE) Trade-Off. Most previous
studies on the EE Trade-Off have relied on response data,
leading to some ambiguity over whether uncertainty leads to
true exploratory behavior, or whether the pattern of
responding simply reflects a simpler ratio choice rule (such as
the Generalized Matching Law (Baum, 1974; Herrnstein,
1961)). Here, we argue that the study of this issue can be
enriched by measuring changes in attention (via eye-gaze),
with the potential to disambiguate these two accounts. We
find that when moving from certainty into uncertainty, the
overall level of attention to stimuli in the task increases; a
finding we argue is outside of the scope of ratio choice rules.

Introduction
In everyday decision-making, we often have to choose
between trying something new, or sticking with what we
know. For example, when deciding what to eat at a
restaurant, we can choose to order our regular “safe” meal
(e.g., spaghetti bolognese), or try a new “risky” meal (e.g.,
steak tartare). By ordering the risky meal, we learn about
how tasty it is. If it is tastier than our regular meal, we may
become more likely to order it on subsequent visits.
However, if it is worse than the regular meal, we wasted an
opportunity to sample our regular meal. This problem is
known as the Exploitation/Exploration Trade-Off (or “EE
Trade-Off”) (Cohen, McClure, & Yu, 2007; Knox et al.,
2012; Mehlhorn et al., 2015).
One common method used to study the EE Trade-Off is
the Multi-Armed Bandit Task (e.g., Daw et al., 2006; Gittins,
1979; Knox et al., 2012; Speekenbrink & Konstantinidis,
2015). On each trial, participants are presented several
“arms” and are asked to pick one arm to receive some
reward (e.g., points). Each arm provides a different amount
of reward, with the goal of the participant being to
maximize the amount of reward they receive. Participants
are not told the value of each arm at the outset, and must
learn these values through sampling each arm. The reward

Work by Daw et al. (2006) found evidence that exploitation
is the “default” for human behavior, while exploration is a
high-level decision not to exploit on a given trial.
Subsequent research with the multi-armed bandit task has
primarily focused on determining what parameters induce
exploratory responding over exploitative responding.
Two major accounts have been proposed for what causes
people to switch from exploitation to exploration. One
influential account that has emerged argues that
environmental uncertainty is key in motivating exploration
(Beesley, Nguyen, Pearson, & Le Pelley, 2015; Gold &
Shadlen, 2007; Knox et al., 2012; Speekenbrink &
Konstantinidis, 2015). That is, the less certain a participant
is about the dynamics of their environment, the more likely
they are to spend time exploring it (Mehlhorn et al., 2015).
For example, if the quality of food at a restaurant is highly
variable, you may explore many different meals before
settling on a preferred one. By contrast, if the quality of
meals is fairly consistent, you may quickly settle on a
preferred meal. The key implication of this account is that
exploration is an intentional attempt to reduce the amount of
uncertainty in the environment (and thus aid informed
decision making).
The other major account argues that in most cases,
exploration can be explained by ratio choice rules (Sakai &
Fukai, 2008). In their review, Gold and Shadlen (2007)
suggested that most exploratory behavior might adequately
be explained by a form of Herrnstein’s (1961) Matching
Law (See also Baum, 1974). The Matching Law states that
the ratio of responding on each arm is equivalent to the ratio
of reinforcement for each of those arms. That is, participants
“match” how often they select each arm, based on the

3484

perceived average reward for the selected arm compared to
others. For example, in a two-armed bandit task, where arm
A is reinforced 3 times as often as arm B, the Matching Law
states that people will select arm A 3 times as often as arm
B. Importantly, while participants still preferentially select
the optimal arm (A), they will also switch to the other, suboptimal arm (B) on 25% of trials. In this case, switching
away from the optimal arm does not represent an intentional
attempt to lessen uncertainty in the environment, but instead
represents participants employing a (somewhat crude) ratio
choice rule.
Baum (1974) provided an extension to Herrnstein’s
(1961) “Simple” Matching Law to account for a wider array
of choice behavior. This “Generalized Matching Law”
included two additional parameters: bias and sensitivity,
where bias reflects a tendency for selecting a given option
over other available options (irrespective of the
reinforcement rate for each option), and sensitivity
determines how strictly a participant conforms to the choice
ratio for their selections. The Generalized Matching Law
has been shown to account for a wider variety of choice
behavior than the Simple Matching Law (Baum, 1974;
Schneider & Lickliter, 2010), and is the version applied in
this paper.
It is important to note that, even when employing a ratio
choice rule like the Matching Law, participants can still
update their knowledge of the environment by picking suboptimal responses (as determined by the choice rule).
However, the crucial distinction is that exploratory choices
occur on the basis of a ratio determined by the choice rule,
and are not an intentional attempt to lessen uncertainty. For
the purpose of the current paper, this type of behavior may
be considered synonymous with the phenomenon known as
probability matching (Sakai & Fukai, 2008; Shanks, Tunney,
& McCarthy, 2002 – though strictly these two phenomena
are slightly different, see Shanks et al., 2002).
The main difference between the uncertainty account and
the ratio choice rule account of exploration is that, in the
former, uncertainty is a catalyst for participants to explore
(and thus lessen the total uncertainty in the task); while in
the latter, exploration occurs as a product of some choice
function. One key issue in attempting to differentiate these
two accounts is that it is difficult to increase uncertainty
without changing the reward value of the different arms. For
example, in the commonly used “walking bandit task” (Daw
et al. 2006; Laureiro-Martinez et al., 2015; Speekenbrink &
Konstantinidis, 2015), uncertainty is implemented by
stochastically walking (slowly changing) the mean reward
for each arm every trial. While this does serve to make the
value of each arm uncertain, it also necessarily causes
changes to the probability of picking each arm as given by
ratio choice rules. Therefore, it is hard to determine whether
an attempt to reduce the uncertainty in the task, or a
predetermined ratio choice rule, is responsible for
motivating exploration under these circumstances.
While it is possible to use cognitive modeling techniques
to examine whether uncertainty motivates exploration (e.g.,

Daw et al., 2006; Knox et al., 2012; Speekenbrink &
Konstantinidis, 2015; Stevyers, Lee, & Wagenmakers,
2009), the conclusions of these methods have been mixed. A
recent study by Beesley et al. (2015) argued that attention
may be another viable metric for assessing the EE Trade-Off.
Beesley et al. conducted a study in which participants were
presented with two cues and were asked to make a choice
between two responses. One cue was informative about
what the optimal response was on that trial, while the other
cue was task-irrelevant. Beesley et al. measured participants’
attention by tracking eye-gaze on the two cues. They
showed that when cues were perfect predictors of the
optimal response, participants attended to the informative
cue over the task-irrelevant cue. However, when cues were
imperfect predictors of the optimal response (i.e., predicted
the optimal response on only two-thirds of trials),
participants increased their attention to both the informative
and task-irrelevant cue, indicating greater exploration of the
cues. Beesley et al. argued that these findings were
synonymous with the EE trade-off. The implication,
therefore, is that exploration can be exhibited in behavioral
domains outside of participant choice, and that exploration
cannot be solely explained by ratio choice rules (the
predictions of which are restricted to the response domain
alone).
One limitation to the Beesley et al. task was that the
experimenters provided participants with feedback about
which response was optimal on each trial. Therefore, while
participants appeared to explore the information in the task
by altering their attentional processing, they had no
incentive to explore different responses to find the one that
was most optimal (as they were told which response was
optimal regardless of their choice). Thus, the current paper
aims to assess whether uncertainty can induce exploratory
behavior in both participants’ attention and responses, and
hence provide wider support for the idea that uncertainty
drives exploration. This would imply that exploration itself
is perhaps a more complex, intentional process, which
would place it outside the scope of ratio choice rules alone.
Furthermore, it would suggest that exploration can manifest
itself across more than one aspect of behavior (choice and
attention). We used a four-armed bandit task where we
manipulated uncertainty both within and between subjects.
We measured responding and gaze-time to the different
arms during the task. In line with our hypotheses, we found
that participants made fewer optimal responses and spent
longer fixating on task elements when the task had an
element of uncertainty, suggesting that uncertainty acts as a
catalyst for exploration.

Method
This experiment aimed to examine the effect of uncertainty
on attention and responding in a four-armed bandit task.
Participants completed a variant of the bandit task, where on
every trial they were presented four arms and asked to pick
two. Two of the arms conferred 30 points (the High Value
[HV] arms) and the remaining two arms conferred 15 points

3485

(the Low Value [LV] arms). After making their choice,
participants were rewarded with the cumulative score
associated with each arm. For example, if the participant
selected an HV arm worth 30 points and an LV arm worth
15 points, they received a reward of 45 points for that trial.
The experiment was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 of
the task had a deterministic reward structure, in which each
arm always yielded the same amount. Stage 1 was designed
to be simple, such that participants could quickly learn the
structure of the task and engage in what might be considered
an exploitative pattern of behavior. In Stage 2 of the task,
rewards were drawn stochastically from a uniform
distribution for each combination of arms, with the mean
reward value set at the same value as in the first stage.
Stages 1 and 2 were coined the Certain and Uncertain
stages respectively. In terms of participants’ responding, we
hypothesized that when rewards became uncertain,
participants would make more exploratory, non-optimal
responses, and this exploration would be greater for
participants who experienced greater uncertainty (consistent
with Knox et al., 2012; Speekenbrink & Konstantinidis,
2015). In terms of gaze-time, we hypothesized that when
rewards became uncertain in Stage 2, participants would
increase their gaze-time to all arms in the task. Furthermore,
we hypothesized that the greater the level of uncertainty in
those rewards in Stage 2, the more gaze time that would be
allocated to the arms in the task, with more gaze time to HV
arms over LV arms (consistent with Beesley et al., 2015).

Design
The design of the experiment is shown in Table 1. The key
manipulation of the amount of uncertainty present in Stage 2
was manipulated between-subjects. Uncertainty was
operationalized as the range of possible scores around the
mean reward value that could be received following a trial
(in Stage 2). For example, a reward distribution of ±3 (Low
Uncertainty) meant that after the participant made their
selections, they received the cumulative score of those arms
(e.g., 45 points if they picked one HV arm and one LV arm),
±3 points (uniformly distributed across trials). Therefore, in
this case, the participant could receive a score from 42 to 48.
The Low Uncertainty condition had a reward distribution of
±3, and the High Uncertainty condition had a reward
distribution of ±18. The crucial difference between these
two conditions was that in the High Uncertainty condition,
the two score distributions overlapped, such that
participants could sometimes earn more points after a choice
of an HV arm and an LV arm than after a choice of two HV
arms. By comparison, for participants in the Low
Uncertainty condition, the optimal response was always
picking two HV arms. The dependent variables were
proportion of HV arms picked, and gaze-time on HV and
LV arms as a proportion of trial time.

Participants
Sixty-five UNSW Sydney undergraduate students were
recruited in exchange for course credit. The two highest
scoring participants received a $20 prize.

Apparatus and Materials
Participants were tested individually in a quiet room. During
the task, participants’ eye-gaze was tracked using a 58.4cm
widescreen Tobii eye-tracking monitor (TX-300).
Participants were seated approximately 60cm from the
monitor, and had their heads steadied by a chin rest. The
eye-tracker was calibrated at the start of the task. The
experiment was run in MATLAB using the Psychophysics
Toolbox extension (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner, Brainard, &
Pelli, 2007; Pelli, 1997). Participants mades all responses
via a standard keyboard and mouse.
The four arms in the experiment were represented as four
colored squares of 200 by 200 pixels (visual angle of
approximately 5°). The four colors were always red, green,
blue, and yellow (Figure 1). Color assignment to design
elements (i.e., HV and LV arms) was counterbalanced
between participants (24 permutations).

Procedure
At the start of the experiment, participants were instructed
that they would be playing a simple guessing game, where
the objective of the game was to maximize the number of
points they received. On each trial, the four colored arms
were presented in the four quadrants of the screen. The
location of each arm was counterbalanced between trials,
with a full counterbalance of positions taking 24 trials.
Participants used the mouse to select two arms. Participants
were allowed to deselect arms they had selected by clicking
on the arm a second time. Once the participant had selected
two arms, a small “Submit” (120 by 60 pixels) button
appeared in the center of the screen. If the participant
selected more than two arms, or deselected an arm, the
button disappeared.

Once the submit button was clicked, the four arms and the
cursor disappeared, and the participant was told how many
points they had earned on that trial, as well as the total
points accumulated so far. Points were calculated by
aggregating the value of the two arms the participant had
selected, with the addition of the reward uncertainty in
Stage 2 (see Design). Participants then pressed the spacebar
to start the next trial. The location of the cursor was reset to
the center of the screen on each trial.
Stage 1 consisted of 96 trials and Stage 2 144 trials. The
start of Stage 2 was not signaled to participants in any way.
The only difference between Stage 1 and 2 was the addition
of the variability (stochastic noise) for rewards (see Design
and Table 1).

Results
Data were collapsed into blocks of 24 trials for analysis. If a
participant had less than 50% of trials with valid eyetracking data recorded, they were excluded from analysis (n
= 10). In addition, participants who selected the HV arms
less than 70% of the time in the final block of Stage 1 were
inferred to have not learnt the associations adequately, and
were also excluded (n = 7). For each exclusion, we ensured
a complete counterbalancing of design elements by
recruiting a new participant with the same counterbalancing
conditions. Trials in which the participant took two standard
deviations longer than their mean trial time were excluded
from all analyses.
Response data are shown in Figure 2 and were analyzed
in three parts, Stage 1 (blocks 1 to 4), the between-stage
transition period (blocks 4 and 5), and Stage 2 (blocks 5 to
10), using a repeated measures ANOVA with a withinsubjects factor of block and a between-subjects factor of
condition. Effect sizes are reported as generalized etasquared, η2G (see Bakeman, 2005). In Stage 1, a significant
effect of block was observed, F(3, 138) = 98.84, p < .001,
η2G = .447, with participants in both conditions increasing
selections of HV arms as they progressed through Stage 1.
During the transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2, a significant
effect of block was observed, F(1, 46) = 80.4, p < .001, η2G
= .465, with participants decreasing their selections of HV
arms from Stage 1 to Stage 2. A significant effect of
condition was also observed, F(1, 46) = 18.06, p < .001, η2G
= .165, with participants less likely to choose the HV arms
in the High Uncertainty group. Finally, there was a
significant interaction between block and condition, F(1, 46)
= 22.56, p < .001, η2G = .197, with the proportion of HV arm
choices showing a greater decrease in the high uncertainty
conditions than the low uncertainty condition during the
transition period.
In Stage 2, a significant effect of block was observed, F(5,
230) = 22.68, p < .001, η2G = .165, with participants
increasing their selections of HV arms over the course of
Stage 2. A significant effect of condition, F(1, 46) = 24.71,
p < .001, η2G = .243, and a significant interaction between
condition and block, F(5, 230) = 5.02, p < .001, η2G = .042,
were observed, with participants picking HV arms less

frequently in the High Uncertainty condition, but also
showing a greater increase in their selection of HV arms
over the course of Stage 2, compared to participants in the
Low Uncertainty condition.
Gaze-time data are shown in Figure 3. Gaze-time was
calculated as the summed time of all fixations on the
different arms in the task. A fixation was determined to have
occurred if a participant’s gaze did not deviate more than 75
pixels vertically or horizontally for at least 150ms. Total
fixation time was calculated by extending this time until the
participant’s gaze exited the 75 pixel limit (in accordance
with Beesley et al., 2015; Salvucci & Goldberg, 2000).
Proportion of gaze-time was calculated as the total fixation
on each arm divided by the total trial time. Again, these data
were analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA, with a
within-subjects factor of block, a within-subjects factor of
arm value (high and low), and a between-subjects factor of
condition. A significant effect of block was observed in
Stage 1, F(3, 138) = 18.85, p < .001, η2G = .062, with
participants decreasing their total gaze-time to arms
throughout Stage 1. A significant effect of arm value was
also observed, F(1, 138) = 276.77, p < .001, η2G = 0.675,
along with a significant interaction between block and arm
value, F(3, 138) = 17.86, p < .001, η2G = .066, with
participants gazing more at HV arms than LV arms, and this
difference increasing over the course of Stage 1.

In the transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2, there was a
significant effect of block, F(1, 46) = 15.80, p < .001, η2G
= .039, with participants increasing their total gaze-time at
the onset of uncertainty. The significant effect of arm value
was maintained, F(1, 46) = 282.29, p < .001, η2G = .713.
There was no effect of condition observed on gaze-time, F(1,
46) = 2.21, p = .144, and there was no interaction between
block and condition, F < 1. In Stage 2, the significant effect
of arm value was maintained, F(1, 46) = 362.42, p < .001,
η2G = .721, and no effect of condition was observed, F < 1.
No effect interaction between block and condition was
observed in Stage 2, F(5, 230) = 1.19, p = .3161.

Discussion
In a reinforcement learning task, participants earned points
for combinations of responses. In Stage 1, one combination
of responses was optimal and participants readily learnt this
relationship. In Stage 2, we introduced variation in the
number of points received, while keeping the mean number
of points per response constant. When moving from the
certainty of Stage 1 to the uncertainty of Stage 2,
participants in both conditions reduced their rate of optimal
responding, and this reduction was greater for participants
who experienced greater uncertainty. Following this change
in behavior at the outset of Stage 2, participants in both
conditions increased their rate of optimal responding over
the course of Stage 2.
In the High Uncertainty condition, the choice behavior of
participants is well predicted by the Matching Law.
However, crucially in the Low Uncertainty condition the
Matching Law fails to predict the drop in optimal
responding at the onset of. If a participant in the Low
Uncertainty condition were following the Matching Law,
they should not show a decrease in optimal responding at
the onset of uncertainty. This finding suggests that
exploratory choice cannot be solely explained by the
Matching Law, and provides support to the idea that
uncertainty can drive exploration. The reason why
participants in the Low Uncertainty condition chose to
switch away from the optimal response at the onset of
uncertainty is not immediately clear. However, one possible
explanation is that when participants perceived that the
nature of the task had changed (i.e., rewards were no longer
confined to three set values), they felt compelled to explore
the other previously discounted responses to ensure they had
not changed in any significant way.
In terms of the attentional data, we found support for two
of our three hypotheses. Unsurprisingly, participants began
to pay more attention to HV arms over LV arms over the
course of the experiment. This is compatible with a host of
research from the associative learning literature (See Le

Framework at osf.io/y6hqp.

Pelley et al., 2016, for a review), showing that participants
are likely to direct their attention to the most valuable
predictors in a task (also see Le Pelley et al., 2015).
Furthermore, there is evidence that participants will attend
more to arms they are intending to select prior to making
their response (e.g., Manohar & Husain, 2013). As
participants selected more HV arms, this likely contributed
to participants preferentially attending to them over LV
arms.
Crucially, we have shown evidence that an onset of
uncertainty is associated with an increase in attention. Once
rewards became uncertain at the onset of Stage 2,
participants in all conditions increased their gaze-time to all
arms in the task. Our data are in line with the findings of
Beesley et al. (2015), and provide support to the idea that
uncertainty can instigate exploratory behavior in both the
choice responses and attentional bias. We argue that these
data are beyond the scope of ratio choice rules, which do not
provide a natural account of attentional changes under
conditions of uncertainty and would not predict changes in
response rate across the course of Stage 2. While the notion
that uncertainty increases attentional processing of stimuli is
not novel (Pearce & Hall, 1980), very little is known about
attentional processing in multi-armed bandit tasks like the
one used in the current experiment. The current findings
suggest that pursuing this line of research may be important
to gaining a more complete understanding of human
decision-making.
However, we did not find evidence for gaze-time
interacting with the level of uncertainty. If the uncertainty
account of exploration is correct, we should have observed
greater exploration under greater uncertainty. Instead, the
amount of gaze-time participants paid to the arms was
comparable under both levels of uncertainty. One possible
reason for this is that moving from a completely certain
environment to an environment with any level of
uncertainty may cause attention to increase. Yu and Dayan
(2005) showed that participants behave differently when
uncertainty is expected (i.e., present for the entire task)
compared to when uncertainty is unexpected (i.e., a period
of uncertainty occurs suddenly, following a period of
certainty). It may be the case that when unexpected
uncertainty occurred, attention increased by a set amount in
response (regardless of the degree of that uncertainty). Also,
while gaze-time does appear to be affected by uncertainty,
the effect-size in our study was much smaller in comparison
to the effect of uncertainty on responding (η2G = .039
compared to η2G = .465). This may suggest that while
changes in response rate and changes in overt attention are
signals of exploration under uncertain conditions, that
uncertainty affects these behavioral markers by distinct
mechanisms. Alternatively, these data might suggest that
gaze-time was less sensitive to uncertainty than was

3488

participants’ responding, which made it harder to detect any
effect of the different levels of uncertainty and gaze-time.
In summary, we have shown that the introduction of
uncertainty into a four-armed bandit task caused a general
increase in attending, and a decrease in optimal responding.
This provides support for the idea that environmental
uncertainty causes an increase in exploratory behavior, and
challenges the idea that exploration can be explained purely
by ratio choice rules.
