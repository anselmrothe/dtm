Abstract
Theories about the role of emotions in moral cognition make
different predictions about the relative speed of moral and
affective judgments: those that argue that felt emotions are
causal inputs to moral judgments predict that recognition of
affective states should precede moral judgments; theories
that posit emotional states as the output of moral judgment
predict the opposite. Across four studies, using a speeded
reaction time task, we found that self-reports of felt emotion
were delayed relative to reports of event-directed moral
judgments (e.g. badness) and were no faster than persondirected moral judgments (e.g. blame). These results pose a
challenge to prominent theories arguing that moral
judgments are made on the basis of reflecting on affective
states.
Keywords: affect, emotion, moral judgment, reaction time

Introduction
There is broad agreement that affective phenomena play an
important role in moral cognition; there is widespread
disagreement, however, over the particular role that affect
plays. Many theories suggest that emotion acts as an input
to moral judgment: that affective states help distinguish
moral from non-moral events (Nichols, 2002), indicate the
severity of the transgression (Haidt, 2001), or bias
downstream cognitive processes (Alicke, 2000). In contrast
to these “emotion-as-input” (em-in) models, “emotion-asoutput” (em-out) models argue that, very often,
considerations of rules, norms, risk or caused harm, and
causal and mental information, guide moral judgments
without any necessary causal precedence of affect (Huebner,
Dwyer, & Hauser, 2009; Mikhail, 2011). According to these
models, emotions are typically connected to moral
judgments because as they motivate and scale our social
responses.
The focus of our paper is on a prominent subset of the emin theories, which claim that emotions precede and influence
moral judgment through felt affect. For example, Schnall
Haidt, Clore, and Jordan (2008) claim, “When making
evaluative judgments, people attend to their own feelings, as
if asking themselves: How do I feel about it?” (p. 1097,
emphasis added). Similarly, Miller et al (2012) argue that
“the likelihood of judging an action wrong is determined…
by how upsetting you consider the action itself to be” (p

574). That is, moral judgments of some event are formed by
recognizing and reporting one’s emotional response to that
event. This is why, according to these theories, the
experience of negative affect on its own (i.e. absent
appraisals of harm or risk) can yield negative moral
evaluations (e.g. Haidt, 2001). The primary source of
evidence for this comes from affect misattribution
experiments in which inducing feelings of disgust (unrelated
to the stimulus) both amplified the perceived wrongness of
target behaviors (Schnall, et al., 2008; Cheng, Ottati, &
Price, 2013) and appeared to cause ordinarily permissible
behaviors to be judged as wrong (Wheatley & Haidt, 2005).
Though initially promising, many of the findings in favor
of the em-in model of moral judgment have been called into
question. First, it appears as though many moral judgments
can be made absent any affective experience (Niedenthal,
Rohmann, & Dalle, 2003) and, conversely, many strong
emotional reactions occur without any corresponding moral
judgment (Royzman, Goodwin, & Leeman, 2011).
Additionally, the primary source of evidence for the causal
role of felt affect has been called into question: a recent
meta-analysis reports that, across dozens of experiments,
there is not reliable effect of incidental disgust on moral
judgment (Landy & Goodwin, 2015).
However, even though these findings are consistent with
em-out models, a major challenge in assessing any of the
theories regarding the role of emotion in moral judgment is
the dearth of experimental paradigms that get at the heart of
the causal primacy question—whether the routine causal
sequence is, according to one set of theories, event →
emotion → moral judgment or, according to the other set of
theories, event → moral judgment → emotion. What is
needed are independent and time-locked measurements of
the relevant moral and affective processes as they emerge in
response to a range of different moral violations.
Because causality implies temporal precedence, we
reasoned that if attended emotions cause moral evaluations,
then participants ought to experience (and be able to report)
certain emotions (such as feeling angry or upset) before
being able to judge the moral status of that behavior. In
contrast, if moral judgments guide affect or emotions based
on perceived norm violations, causal and mental
information, and so on, then felt emotions should follow
moral judgments.

Experimental Paradigm

Study 1

To examine questions of causal primary, we conducted a
series of reaction time experiments to test the relative speed
of moral, non-moral, and affective reactions to value-laden
events. We relied on a variant of the simultaneous inference
paradigm (SIP, Smith & Miller, 1983; Malle & Holbrook,
2012) to measure the speed at which people make different
judgments in response to short descriptions of moral
transgressions. In the SIP, participants learn to associate a
question with a short cue (or, hereafter, “probe”) which is
then used to elicit responses in a speeded-judgment task.
These probes minimize the latency between the presented
question and the participant’s comprehension, as well as
differences in the length and complexity of full questions.
Prior research using the SIP trained participants on
dichotomous Yes-No judgments (e.g. “Did the behavior
reveal a certain goal the actor has?”), which required
modification for two reasons: First, many moral and
affective reactions are graded: stabbing someone is worse
than keying their car, which is worse than stealing their
pencil. A simple Yes-No judgment does not indicate that
someone is sensitive to these differences. Second, and
relatedly, a prediction of em-in models is that the extremity
of the affective reaction predicts the perceived severity of
the transgression (e.g. Miller et al, 2012), which makes the
best test of these models one in which both moral and
affective judgments require reporting this more specific,
nuanced information. To do this, we presented each probe
along with a 7-point rating scale from which participants
selected their response as quickly as they could.
We also varied the type of moral scenario participants
would react to. Different kinds of events reliably lead to
different moral and affective reactions (e.g. people blame
transgressors more for intentional harms relative to
unintentional ones), and these different outputs are thought
to reflect different underlying cognitive processes
(Cushman, 2013; Malle et al, 2014). Furthermore, variation
in encountered behavior better reflects the experience of
encountering random morally relevant behaviors in the real
world and generates variation that requires participants’
attention. To this end, studies 1-2 mixed intentional and
unintentional violations, while studies 3 and 4 mixed
intentional, unintentional, and non-agent caused events.
Across four experiments, we measured reaction times for
four response types: (1) non-moral judgments (e.g
“Intentional?”), (2) moral evaluations of the event (e.g.,
“Bad?” or “Good?”), (3) moral judgments of the person
(e.g., “Blame?”), and (4) reports of one’s own affective state
(e.g., “Angry?”). As argued above, the em-in models predict
that people’s responses to the affective probes should be
faster than the responses to the moral probes, whereas the
em-out models predict the opposite. For the purpose of the
current report, we will focus on these a priori contrasts of
response times, setting aside the speed of other probes and
the specific ratings people provided.

Methods
Participants. 241 people (130 self-reported as female, mean
age = 35) recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
(AMT) participated in this experiment.
Stimuli. We constructed 24 short descriptions of an agent
causing harm either intentionally or unintentionally (e.g.
“When she walked by a homeless man asking for money,
Lisa spit on the ground in front of him”). Intentionality was
verified through pretesting (mean intentionality ratings for
intentional and unintentional descriptions were 8.17 and
2.35 respectively on a 1-9 scale). The 12 intentional and
unintentional sentences were matched on length (15.3 and
15.8 words for intentional and unintentional conditions,
respectively) and varied in moral severity (valence ratings 1.1 to -4.0, M = -2.45, for intentional transgressions, and 0.65 to -3.88, M = -2.00 for unintentional transgressions on
a -4 to +4 scale).
Judgments. Our non-moral, social judgment probed
intentionality (Cue: INTENTIONAL? Full: Was the main
character's behavior INTENTIONAL?) on a [1] definitely
not intentional to [7] definitely intentional scale. Our eventdirected moral evaluation probed “badness” (Cue: BAD?
Full: How BAD was the thing that happened? Scale: [1] not
at all bad – [7] the most bad possible), while our persondirected moral judgment probed judgments of
blameworthiness (How much BLAME does the main
character deserve? Scale: [1] no blame at all – [7] the most
blame possible). Finally, to assess participants’ affective
states, we used a general feeling probe (Cue: FEEL? Full:
How much did the story make you FEEL something? Scale:
[1] no feeling at all – [7] the most feeling possible).
Design. The study crossed two within-subject factors:
behavior type (intentional vs unintentional) and judgment
type (INTENTIONAL, BAD, BLAME, FEEL). The 24
experimental stimuli and four judgments types were
distributed over participants such that they were probed for
each judgment type 6 times, (three for intentional behaviors,
three for unintentional behaviors). We used a Latin-square
design to pair each of the four judgments with each of the
24 stories across four lists. The order of stimuli and probes
was randomized for each participant within each list.
Procedure. The entire experiment was conducted through
the participant’s web browser. At the beginning of the
experiment, participants received instructions, including a
description of the cues and their associated meanings, as
well as the fact that they would be doing a speededjudgment task and so would have limited time to read and
respond to the vignettes. They then completed a training
session in which they were taught the single-word cues for
the associated judgments (e.g. “BAD?” for “How bad was
the thing that happened?”).
During the experiment, for each trial, a one-sentence
description of a transgression was displayed in the center of

1849

the screen. It remained for 4.5s and was replaced by the
probe and a seven-point rating scale (participants did not
know which probe would be displayed for any trial).
Participants were instructed to place their fingers on the
number row of the keyboard and press the corresponding
number to respond. Once they indicated their response, the
cue and scale disappeared and the next trial automatically
started. At the end of the experiment, participants filled out
a brief demographics questionnaire indicating their gender,
age, and language background.

Results
We removed all trials with reaction times greater than 10
seconds (0.7% data loss). Otherwise, no other trials or
participants were removed from data analysis.
Following previous studies (Malle & Holbrook, 2012), we
conducted simple effects tests comparing RTs for the affect
probe with RTs for other judgment types separately within
intentional and within unintentional behaviors. Our primary
question was whether reaction times to the affective
judgment probe were slower than to other judgment probes.
We used linear mixed-effect models (LMEM) to regress
RTs on judgment type, which was dummy coded with
affective judgment (here, FEEL) as the baseline. Finally, due
to the within-subject design, each model included random
intercepts and slopes for each participant as well as a
random intercept for each scenario.
When judging intentional behaviors, reaction times for
FEEL judgments (M = 2563, SD = 1246) were significantly
slower compared to INTENTIONAL (M = 2113, SD = 985, b =
-452.52, SE = 62.9, t = -7.19, p < 0.001), BAD (M = 2332,
SD = 1204, b = -233.04, SE = 57.49, t = -4.054, p < 0.001),
and BLAME (M = 2355, SD = 1211, b = -214.44, SE =
55.964, t = -3.832, p < 0.001). However, when judging
unintentional transgressions, we observed no significant
difference between FEEL (M = 2640, SD = 1267) and
INTENTIONAL (M = 2540, SD = 1240, b = -98.71, SE =
59.936, t = -1.647, p = 0.1), BAD (M = 2545, SD = 1244, b =
-96.17, SE = 59.09, t = -1.63, p = 0.104), or BLAME (M =
2647, SD = 1339, b = 13.88, SE = 60.93, t = 0.23, p = 0.82).

Discussion
Study 1 provides preliminary support against em-in models
in favor of em-out models. Reaction times for the emotion
probe FEEL were slower than those for judgments of
INTENTIONALITY, BAD, and BLAME, at least when
considering intentional norm violations. There were no
comparable RT differences between the affect probe and the
remaining probes in response to unintentional violations,
perhaps because relevant moral rules are more difficult to
access, harm more difficult to calculate, or responsibility
more complicated to assess (e.g. Malle, et al., 2014).
One possible reason for the slow unfolding of affective
reactions is that participants found it difficult to respond to a
vague probe such as “feel”. To address this possibility, we
conducted another experiment using a more concrete easily
identifiable and morally relevant emotion probe: angry.

Study 2
Methods
Participants, Materials, & Procedure. 237 people (134
self-reported as female, mean age = 35) recruited from
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) participated in this
experiment. Study 2 was identical to Study 1 except that the
affective judgment probe assessed anger (Cue: ANGRY?
Full: How ANGRY are you at the main character? Scale:
[1] not at all angry to [7] the most angry possible).

Results
Reaction times from Study 2 were analyzed identically to
Study 1. Before conducting analyses, we removed all trials
with RTs greater than 10s (2.8% data loss). No other data
were removed.
Replicating Study 1, we found that, in the intentional
condition, INTENTIONAL (M = 2111, SD = 1119) and BAD (M
= 2133, SD = 1091) judgments were both significantly faster
than ANGER judgments (M = 2313, SD = 1150;
INTENTIONAL: b = -203.90, SE = 52.32, t = -3.90, p < 0.001;
BAD: -183.18, SE = 52.90, t = -3.46, p = 0.001). We did not
observe significant differences between ANGER (M = 2448,
SD = 1300) and other judgments for unintentional violations

(INTENTIONAL: M = 2358, SD = 1189, -88.43, SE = 56.65, t
= -1.561, p = 0.119; BAD: M = 2382, SD = 1291, b = -61.22,
SE = 59.91, t = -1.02, p = 0.307). Finally, we detected no
significant difference between ANGER and BLAME for either
intentional (M = 2231, SD = 1214, b = -80.41, SE = 52.94, t
= -1.52, p = 0.129) or unintentional (M = 2426, SD = 1229,
b = -18.10, SE = 55.28, t = -0.33, p = 0.743) behaviors (see
Figure 1).

Discussion
Study 2 largely replicated the findings from Study 1.
However, both studies are limited in several respects. First,
the behaviors were always negative, and the agent in every
description always a causer of harm. It is possible under
these conditions that moral norms become more salient and
accessible or that expectations of high causal agency sped
up moral evaluations. Additionally, anger is typically
directed at persons, and a different emotion term may be
more appropriate for affective reactions to events. Finally,
the studies did not limit participants’ response time. While
most responses occurred within several seconds, it is
nevertheless possible that judgments are consciously
accessible before then without an incentive to reveal these
judgments as soon as they are accessible. The next two
studies were designed to address these shortcomings.

Studies 3 and 4
Methods
Participants. 111 people (58 self-reported as female, mean
age = 37.4) in Study 3 and 193 people (90 self-reported as
female, mean age = 33.4) in Study 4, recruited from AMT
participated in this experiment.
Stimuli. We constructed 28 single-sentence descriptions, 14
featuring a good event and 14 featuring a bad event. For
each valence condition, we constructed four stimuli that had
an agent with no causal role (Non-causal) in the good or bad
event, four in which an agent unintentionally did a good or
bad thing (Unintentional), and a final six in which an agent
intentionally did something good or bad (Intentional).
Pretesting ensured that these items were matched on
intentionality and length across valence, and that all agency
conditions were comparable (see Table 1).
Judgments. We modified the full questions associated with

each cue to accommodate the greater variety of stimulus
events. Similar to Studies 1-2, we included measures of (1)
intentionality (Cue: INTENTIONAL? Full: “Was it
intentional (what the character did)?” Scale: [1] definitely
not intentional - [7] definitely intentional), and (2) the
badness of the event (Cue: BAD? Full: “How bad was it
(what happened)?” Scale: [1] not at all bad - [7] extremely
bad). We also included a measure of (3) the goodness of the
event in order to accommodate the positive valence items
(Cue: GOOD? Full: “How good was it (what happened)?”
Scale: [1] not good at all - [7] extremely good).
Studies 3 and 4 were identical except for the affective
judgment probe. Study 3 measured anger (Cue: ANGRY?
Full: "How angry were you (about what happened)?" Scale:
[1] not at all angry – [7] extremely angry), whereas Study 4
measured “upset” (Cue: UPSET? Full: "How upset were
you (about what happened)?" Scale: [1] not upset at all – [7]
extremely angry).
Design. Studies 3 and 4 crossed two within-subject factors:
event type (non-causal, intentional, and unintentional) and
judgment type (INTENTIONAL, BAD, GOOD, and UPSET or
ANGRY). The 28 experimental stimuli and four judgment
types were distributed over participants in the following
pattern: across the 28 items, participants responded to eight
INTENTIONAL probes, four for intentional behavior
conditions, two for unintentional behavior conditions, and
two in the non-caused behavior conditions. This distribution
meant that roughly half the probes would results in low
intentionality ratings and the other half would result in high
intentionality ratings. Affect probes were also distributed
this way: four for intentional behavior stimuli, two for
unintentional behavior stimuli, and two for non-caused.
These probes were evenly divided between valence
conditions. Finally, participants saw six BAD probes and six
GOOD probes, which were matched to valence. That is,
participants made BAD judgments only following
negatively-valenced stimuli and GOOD judgments only
following positively-valenced stimuli. The twelve moral
evaluation probes (6 BAD and 6 GOOD) were evenly divided
between event type conditions.
Probes were distributed across four stimulus lists
according to a Latin-square design. At the beginning of the
experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of
the four lists and, during the experiment, the order of the
stimulus sentences and probes was randomized.
Procedure. The training and overall experiment procedures
were the same as in Studies 1 and 2, with one exceptions:
For each trial, the judgment screen containing the cue (e.g.
“BAD?”) and the rating scale disappeared after five seconds
after being displayed. If no response was offered before
then, no response was recorded for that trial. Participants
were informed of the time restriction in the instructions.
Prior to the experiment, participants conducted five practice
trials to get accustomed to the procedure.

1851

Results
We removed all trials in which the participant did not
provide an answer within the time constraint (1.6% data loss
in Study 3, 3% data loss in Study 4). No other data were
removed. Similar to Studies 1 and 2, we conducted separate
analyses on the Intentional, Unintentional, and Non-Causal
behaviors, using the same mixed-effect regression models
and adding the Valence (positive vs. negative) term, which
predicted changes in the dummy variable (affect) as a
function of positive or negative behaviors. Across all
models in both studies, valence was not significant and did
not improve model fit, and so was removed as a predictor.

SD = 723, b = 292.20, SE = 50.56, t = 5.78, p < 0.001).

Discussion
Results from Studies 3 and 4 replicated our previous
findings (see Figure 2): Moral evaluations of intentional
violations were reliably faster than reports of felt anger and
upsetness. For unintentional violations, reporting feeling
upset was not significantly slower than negative moral
evaluations, but anger was. Perhaps upset feelings are more
globally sensitive to any unfortunate outcome and therefore
converge with (but on average do not precede) badness
judgments. Lastly, intentionality judgments were slowed in
response to unintentional and uncaused events—which is
not entirely surprising given that those events are clearly not
intentional; the detection of negation may take time.

General Discussion
Across four experiments, participants were reliably slower
at reporting their emotional states in response to norm
violations compared to reporting their moral judgments.
More specifically, the results from these studies showed a
clear speed advantage for event-directed judgments of
badness and, often, intentionality judgments. These results
fit both with theoretical models of moral judgment arguing
that moral appraisals precede emotion, as well as prior work
showing that intentionality and norm violation detection can
occur extremely quickly (Malle & Holbrook, 2012; Van
Berkum et al, 2009). These findings did not extend to
person-directed moral judgments (blame), consistent with
theories that blame is more complex than event-directed
evaluations (e.g. Cushman, 2013; Malle et al, 2014).
One important limitation of these studies comes from the
observation that, while we are interested in characterizing

1852

the cognitive processes underlying moral judgment when
people are exposed to a morally relevant stimulus, we
measured people’s reaction times to probes that were
displayed after the stimulus had been shown. It is possible
that participants attended to their affective reactions when
they were first exposed to the stimulus, which resulted in a
moral judgment, which they later more quickly retrieved
during the post-stimulus probe. However, while we cannot
rule this out, it is not clear why affect would be more
difficult to retrieve post-stimulus as opposed to duringstimulus (when one’s attention is presumably directed
outward toward reading the stimulus). Additionally, this
account does not explain why the speed of retrieving
affective information would change as a function of the
behavior (Study 4). Finally, prior work using a simultaneous
inference paradigm found that post-stimulus reaction times
directly recapitulated online measures (Malle & Holbrook,
2012).
Second, affect may have been slower relative to moral
and social judgments because of an attention switching cost:
the non-affect judgments targeted the stimulus while the
affect judgment targeted oneself. Because em-in models
explicitly predict a shift in attention from the behavior to
one’s affective state, a delay in reporting due to switching
attention is not, in principle, a confound for our test. That
said, this cost may have been exacerbated by the relative
balance of event-directed (75%) versus self-directed (25%)
probes, and future studies should use an even balance of
affect and moral judgments.
Finally, even if we accept that felt emotions do occur after
explicit moral judgment, our data do not rule out the
possibility that pre-conscious affective processes play a role
in moral judgment formation (say, by interfering with
cognitive processes, Alicke, 2000). It is also possible that
conscious affect may play a causal role when judging more
ambiguous situations, in which relevant harm or rule
information is difficult to access. Consistent with this,
badness and blame judgments were not reliably faster than
emotion reports when judging accidental bad behavior.
Thus, our results may only hold for relatively common or
extreme, but not unusual or novel situations.
In summary, we found that people could report moral
evaluations of norm-violating events more quickly than their
emotional reactions to these events. These results pose a
challenge to models claiming that felt affect plays a
necessary role in forming moral judgment.
