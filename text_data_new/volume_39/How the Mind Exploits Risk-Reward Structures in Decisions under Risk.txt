Abstract
In many natural domains, risks and rewards are inversely related (Pleskac & Hertwig, 2014). We sought to understand
how people might use this relationship in choosing among
risky gambles. To do so we, manipulated risk-reward structures of monetary gambles to be either negatively or positively
correlated, or uncorrelated. After substantial exposure to these
environments, participants completed a speeded choice task
among non-dominated gambles. Eye-tracking data from this
task suggests that participants often shifted their attention to
mainly one attribute in the correlated conditions, in which the
risk-reward relationship was present. This was an adaptive
strategy that resulted in a similar proportion of expected-value
maximizing choices, compared to a more compensatory processing strategy.

Introduction
How likely is it to win the jackpot in the state lottery? Although many people play this game for a small pay-to-play
fee, most of them also know that they are unlikely to win it.
In fact, the larger rewards that we desire are usually unlikely
to occur. While such a negative relationship between risks
and rewards or probabilities and payoffs exists across gambles in many monetary and nonmonetary domains in the environment, this relationship is hardly every present in empirical studies of risky choice (Pleskac & Hertwig, 2014). In this
study, we investigated how people’s experience with different risk-reward relationships impact how they process explicitly stated payoffs and probabilities in decisions under risk.
In particular, we studied how an environment in which risks
and rewards are correlated would be conducive for the use
of noncompensatory processing strategies, that ignore part of
the attributes, in a situation where time was limited.

Adaptive Decision Making
According to an adaptive view of cognition, people exploit statistical regularities in the environment (Simon, 1956).
As Payne, Bettman and Johnson (1993) found, the extent
to which people exploit structures in the environment can
largely depend on “the structure of the available alternatives,
and [...] the presence of time pressure” (p. 534). For instance, people can decide to rely on a subset of cues in the
environment because cues are often interrelated (Brunswik,
1952). Despite using a reduced amount of information, this
can lead to good choices (Gigerenzer, Todd, & the ABC Research Group, 1999). Here, we propose that the risk-reward
relationship is a key structure that people capitalize on to
make fast, adaptive (or value-maximizing) decisions.

Choice in Risk-Reward Environments
When should and do people rely on risk-reward structures
to inform their decisions? One case is when information is
missing, such as in decisions under uncertainty, where the
probabilities of obtaining a reward are unknown. In this case,
Pleskac and Hertwig (2014) showed that people use a riskreward heuristic, inferring the probability of a payoff from
the magnitude of the payoff itself. In a new set of studies, we
have also found that in using the risk-reward heuristic people
appear to adapt to different risk-reward structures (Leuker,
Pleskac, Pachur, & Hertwig, in prep.). In particular, we exposed participants to different risk-reward environments by
asking them to price gambles from different risk-reward environments. Then we asked participants to choose between
an uncertain prospect (where the probabilities were unstated)
and a certain payoff. Participants’ preferences were again
consistent with them using a risk-reward heuristic, inferring
probabilities from payoff magnitudes. Moreover, their preferences depended on the environment they had been exposed
to previously. For example, participants in the negative condition chose the lower payoff, uncertain options more often
compared to the positive condition. Based on these results,
we sought to examine if and how people adapt their decisionmaking processes to risk-reward structures in decisions under
risk, when payoffs and probabilities of the option are known.

The Current Study
Processing strategies. One way to distinguish between
processing strategies is to consider the amount of attributes
they rely on. Compensatory strategies process and trade off
of all available and relevant information. Noncompensatory
strategies “typically reduce processing demands by ignoring
potentially relevant information” (Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1988). Thus, one important reason to consider noncompensatory processing strategies (despite information being, in
principle, available, as in risky choice) is when time or cognitive resources are limited.
Strategy-environment dependence. Early research on
these two classes of strategies demonstrated that their success largely depends on the environment in which they are
recruited. Specifically, in environments with nondominated
options (e.g., gamble A offers a higher payoff x, but gamble
B offers a higher probability p: xA > xB and pA < pB ), people
should rely on compensatory strategies (see Table 2, Payne et
al., 1988). A decision maker who processes the dimensions

in a noncompensatory fashion in these environments—for instance by relying on a simplifying heuristic that attends to
outcomes only—will suffer “a substantial loss in accuracy”
(Payne et al., 1993, p. 539). In contrast, such noncompensatory processing strategies have been shown to perform well
when dominance is possible (that is, one gamble is better on
all dimensions: if xA > xB and pA > pB ).
Local vs. global environment. By definition, nondominated options create an inverse risk-reward relationship in a
given set of alternatives, because the gamble offering a higher
payoff will always be associated with a lower probability relative to the other gamble (xA > xB and pA < pB ). However,
this “local” risk-reward relationship (within a pair of gambles) can differ from a “global” risk-reward structure (across
a larger reference class of gambles). That is, nondominated
alternatives can be drawn from globally structured or unstructured environments. We propose that both the use and performance of either type of strategy is also highly dependent on
these global risk-reward structures. Global correlations between risks and rewards make one of the cues redundant (payoffs predict probabilities and vice versa). Therefore, we hypothesized that, when options are drawn from correlated riskreward environments, noncompensatory strategies can lead to
accurate, expected-value maximizing choices even if neither
option is dominated. For choices between nondominated options from globally uncorrelated environments, results may
resemble those of Payne, Bettman and Johnson (1988).
To test these ideas, we employed a between-subjects design
manipulating the global risk-reward relationship between the
possible options participants experienced (Figure 1). In a first
pricing phase, we showed participants individual gambles and
asked them to state their willingness to sell each gamble. We
used this phase to expose people to different risk-reward environments. Detailed data from this phase will be reported else-

where. Our focus in this paper is the second phase, where participants chose between pairs of risky options under moderate time pressure (Figure 2). The gambles in the choice phase
were drawn from the same, condition-dependent risk-reward
environments, and paired such that neither option was dominated. We tracked participants’ eye movements to dissociate
between processing strategies across the different risk-reward
environments, as choice patterns alone may not be sufficient
to do so. As an independent test of whether participants had
picked up the different risk-reward relationships, we asked
them to estimate probabilities from payoffs at the end of the
experiment.

Method
Participants
Ninety-three (55 female) participants (mean age = 25.6 yrs,
SD = 3.7; N = 31 per condition) from the participant pool
at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin,
completed the experiment (duration ∼75 min). All participants were paid a fixed rate of e 12 plus a bonus based on
their performance in a random subset of trials from the pricing phase and choice task (e 3.53-11.67).

Design
The experiment consisted of three phases. In the pricing
phase, participants were presented with single gambles and
asked to indicate their willingness to sell for each of them.
Between subjects, we manipulated the types of gambles people were presented with such that payoffs and probabilities
were positively or negatively correlated, or uncorrelated. In
the subsequent choice task, these different risk-reward structures were maintained. People were asked to choose between
gamble pairs within 3s. All gambles were in the gain domain
(”p1 chance of winning x1 , otherwise nothing”). We used an
experimental currency, the E$ (conversion rate 2500E$ = e 1,

2544

disclosed in the instructions). We collected eye-tracking data
during the exposure phase and the choice task. As people
are merely exposed to different risk-reward structures, participants picking up risk-reward structures despite not being told
about the presence of any relationship in the data would constitute a form of unsupervised learning. Finally, in the third
phase we asked participants to estimate the probabilities they
thought were associated with various payoff levels. We did
this to test whether participants had picked up the different
risk-reward structures from the gambles they were exposed
to throughout the study. Participants were not informed about
the estimation task beforehand.
Gamble environments. The gambles from the pricing and
choice phases were constructed such that across gambles,
there was a negative, a positive, or no relationship between
risks and rewards. For the negative condition, we drew
random payoffs from a uniform distribution (range 1.01 −
2500E$). The probabilities for each payoff were inversely
x
. We added
related to the payoff x such that, p = 1 − 2500
normally distributed noise to logit-transformed payoffs and
probabilities. For the positive condition, we reversed the order of probabilities such that the highest probabilities were
now associated with the highest rewards (and vice versa). For
the uncorrelated condition, we re-linked payoffs and probabilities randomly.
Pricing task. The pricing task served to expose participants
to different risk-reward environments. Briefly, participants
were shown each of the 90 gambles from one of the environments and asked to state a price they would be willing to
sell the gamble for. In addition to 90 condition-dependent
gambles based on the aforementioned construction rule, participants were also asked to price 30 gambles that were common to each of the three conditions (triangles in Figure 1),
yielding 120 gamble stimuli per condition. To motivate participants to report their true valuations of the gambles, we
implemented a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auction (Becker,
Degroot, & Marschak, 1964). In particular, ten gambles were
selected at the end of the experiment and participants either
played out the gamble or received their stated selling price.
Choice task. Gambles were created using the same construction rule as above. An initial set of 100 gambles yields
4950 possible gamble pairs. We randomly drew 60 nondominated gamble pairs per condition (see circles in Figure 1). By design of the study, expected value differences
were largest in the uncorrelated and smallest in the positive
condition (uncorrelated: Md = 173E$, .53 - 1374E$; negative condition: Md = 134E$, .49 - 511E$; positive condition: Md = 23E$, .43 - 146E$). In addition, we interspersed
15 gamble pairs that were common to each of the conditions
in the second half of the choice task (triangles in Figure 1),
and 5 choices with dominated options as catch trials, yielding
80 choices in total. Common gambles allowed us to examine condition-dependent processing differences on precisely
the same stimuli. Participants were instructed to choose their

from the same population of gambles they had experienced
in the previous pricing task. Five randomly selected choices
were played out at the end of the experiment.
Estimation task. We drew 20 payoffs (range 1.01 −
2500E$) and asked participants to estimate the probabilities
that had been associated with these payoffs in the main experiment.

Eye-tracking
During the pricing and choice tasks, we collected binocular
eye position data with an EyeTribe tracker, sampled at 60Hz.
The experiment was implemented in PsychoPy 1.83.01 and
the eye-tracking interface PyTribe (Dalmaijer, Mathôt, & Van
der Stigchel, 2013). Each participant’s eye movements were
calibrated using the Eyetribe UI with a 9-point grid before
each task (< 0.7). Participants were seated approximately
60 cm from the screen using a chinrest affixated to the table,
in a room with negligible ambient light. We preprocessed
raw samples by parsing eye-tracking data into fixations and
saccades using the saccades package in R (Saccades Version
0.1-1, 2015), based on a velocity-based algorithm (Engbert &
Kliegl, 2003). Eye-tracking analyses in this paper are based
on fixation data.

Analysis
The data were analyzed using Bayesian General Linear Models using Stan in R for regression analyses (RStanArm Version
2.9.0-4, 2016). We ran 3 chains (2500 samples each, burn-in
of 500), and investigated (convergence of) our posteriors visually and with the Gelman-Rubin statistic (Gelman & Rubin,
1992). We report the mean of the posterior distribution of the
parameter of interest and two-sided 95% equal tail credible
intervals (CI) around each value.

Pricing task. For all participants, prices were strongly related to the expected values of the gambles (credible payoff
× probability interaction, b = .70, CI = [.66, .74]).
Choice task. Participants across all three conditions chose
the expected-value-maximizing options above chance level
(M = .71, CI = [.56, .85]). As expected, in the positive
condition (in which the EV differences between the options
were rather small) participants made fewer EV-maximizing
choices (M = .59, CI = [.51, .67]) than in the uncorrelated
condition (in which the EV differences were larger; M =
.70, b = .11, CI = [.00, .22]), and the negative condition
(M = .74, b = .25, CI = [.14, .37]). Controlling for EV
differences and individual variation, participants in the negative condition achieved a higher proportion of expectedvalue maximizing choices (M = .70, CI = [.52, .88]) compared to the uncorrelated condition (M = .31, b = −.39, CI =
[−.63, −.16]), and the positive condition (M = .39, b = −.32,
CI = [−.54, −.09]). In both models, the highest accuracy was
achieved in the negative condition. In the subset of gambles
that were common across all conditions, there were no differences in accuracy between the conditions (M = .53, CI =
[.35, .72]).
Response times were comparable across all conditions and
gamble types. In addition, small proportions of timed-out trials (negative: .006, positive: .016, uncorrelated: .013) indicate that participants were well-adjusted to the speed instruction of 3s (Md = 1.63s even suggest that people could have
taken more time on many trials).
Estimation task. Participants’ probability estimates reflected the risk-reward structure they had been exposed to
previously. That is, participants in the negative condition
provided lower probability estimates for gambles with higher
payoffs (b = −.64, CI = [−.68, −.60], % per 100 E$), and
in the positive condition participants provided higher probability estimates for gambles with higher payoffs (b = .16,
CI = [.10, .14]). In the uncorrelated condition, participants
provided lower probability estimates for gambles with higher
payoffs (weaker slope compared to the negative condition:
b = −.32, CI = [−.37, −.26]).

Eye-tracking
We defined four areas-of-interest (AOIs), one for each payoff
and probability. We visually inspected the quality of every
participant’s eye-tracking data by plotting their fixations over
time. Seven participants whose fixations did not map onto the
screen correctly were excluded, a possible result of the eyetracker being moved during the experiment. We excluded one
further participant who was blind in one eye, leaving N = 84
for the eye-tracking analyses (27, 29, and 28 in the negative,

positive, and uncorrelated conditions, respectively).
Number of AOIs viewed. To test whether the presence of
a risk-reward relationship led to more noncompensatory processing, we averaged the number of AOIs each participant
viewed (max. 4). Participants in the uncorrelated condition inspected the largest number of AOIs (M = 3.46, CI =
[3.45, 3.48]). Participants in the positive condition inspected
a credibly lower number of AOIs (M = 3.20, b = −.20, CI
= [−.23, −.18]). The negative condition also inspected credibly fewer AOIs, but the difference was smaller (M = 3.40,
b = −.06, CI = [−.08, −.03], model on the trial level). Using the average number of fixations as an alternative indicator
resulted in the same pattern of results, and only a marginally
higher count (uncorrelated condition M = 3.71, negative condition M = 3.51, positive condition M = 3.39), likely because the time limit imposed in the experiment did not allow for many re-acquisitions (i.e., fixations back to a previously acquired AOI). Note that the mean number of fixations
is rather low (i.e. < 4). We ran the same AOI model using
only common gamble data (see triangles in Figure 1). Again,
the uncorrelated condition inspected most AOIs (M = 3.21,
CI = [3.09, 3.34]). This number was lower in the positive condition (M = 2.83, b = −.38, CI = [−.57, −.20], difference credible), and in the negative condition (M = 3.07,

Attention to attributes. Which attributes did participants
attend to, especially when choosing to ignore some of the
information? All participants fixated most on payoff information (.57 of fixations, CI = [.53, .61]). This proportion decreased for participants who inspected more AOIs (b = −.98,
CI = [−1.56, −.38]; no credible effect of condition). At the
extreme end, participants who, on average, inspected roughly
two AOIs fixated on the payoff 80% of the time. An alternative viable noncompensatory strategy would have been to
focus more on the information presented at the top or the bottom of the screen. We counterbalanced the location of attributes (between-participants). However, top/bottom fixation
proportions were unrelated to the number of AOIs inspected
(b = .03, CI = [−.60, .66]), suggesting that participants considered payoff information as more relevant when using noncompensatory strategies.
EV choices by strategy. Do compensatory or noncompensatory strategies differ in performance within the three environments? Figure 4 shows that users of a noncompensatory
strategy (triangles) achieved similar levels of EV-maximizing
choices compared to users of a compensatory strategy (circles), overall (M = −.10, CI = [−.39, .18]). Unexpectedly,
this held irrespective of condition (no credible strategy × condition interaction). This result also held when controlling for
differences between the condition in EV difference between
the options. We expected that in the uncorrelated condition,
decision performance would be compromised for users of a

1.0

p (choose higher EV)

b = −.14, CI = [−.34, .04], difference however not credible). Because these gambles were identical across conditions, this suggests condition-dependent processing strategies
are not merely a by-product of specific risk-reward environments that vary on crucial dimensions such as EV differences
between gambles. Figure 3 suggests substantial individual differences among participants in the conditions (indeed,
differences in numbers of AOIs inspected can be accounted
for by including participant as a grouping factor). More
importantly, however, visual inspection of the data suggests
two subgroups that can roughly be split by the mean number of AOIs inspected across participants (M = 3.11, dashed
line in Figure 3): Participants who tend to inspect all four
AOIs (“compensatory”) and participants who ignore some of
the AOIs (“non-compensatory”). Thus, differences between
conditions may be driven by the composition of compensatory/noncompensatory strategies (proportion compensatory
in uncorrelated: .61, positive: .34, negative: .44). That is, participants in the uncorrelated condition were 2.85 times more
likely to rely on a compensatory strategy than participants in
the positive condition (b = 1.05, CI = [.07, 2.04]). The difference between the negative and positive risk-reward environments was not credible (b = .68, CI = [−.29, 1.73], OR
= 1.97). A majority of participants in the correlated environments thus seemed to rely on a noncompensatory strategy
(note that here such a strategy could also mean attending to
three out of four AOIs per trial, see Figure 3).

noncompensatory strategy—who should lack critical information to determine the EV maximizing option.
At the same time, across conditions, the proportion of
EV-maximizing choices was higher for participants who inspected more AOIs (main effect of AOIs inspected on EV
choice irrespective of processing strategy, b = .044, CI =
[.001, .089]). Within each subgroup, the increase in EV
choices with increasing numbers of AOIs inspected is more
pronounced for participants in the uncorrelated condition (see
black regression line, Figure 4). Yet, this interaction effect is
not credible, potentially due to the small number of participants in each subgroup (AOI × condition interaction with the
positive condition as a reference; compensatory: b = .02, CI
= [-.04, .09]), noncompensatory: b = .05, CI = [-.01, .11]). In
general, one would indeed expect that the increase in the proportion of EV choices with higher number of AOIs inspected
is more pronounced for the uncorrelated condition because
this condition allows for least simplification.

Discussion
Risk-reward relationships allow people to make fast, valuemaximizing decisions. A majority of people exposed to
correlated risk-reward structures used noncompensatory processing strategies, likely as a result of time pressure. With
fewer AOIs inspected, participants focused more on payoff

2547

information. In turn, most people who experienced an uncorrelated risk-reward environment attempted to take into account all attributes, speaking in favor of a more compensatory
processing strategy. This strategy use is adaptive given the
affordances of the different environments. While correlated
risk-reward environments made one of the attributes redundant, such a relationship did not exist for gamble problems in
uncorrelated risk-reward environment. Condition-dependent
processing differences (i.e., numbers of AOIs visited) persisted when restricting the analysis to a common set of gambles interspersed in each of the conditions. Surprisingly, these
differences only had a minor impact on EV choice.
Earlier research suggested that noncompensatory strategies
fare well when dominance is possible, but not when neither
option is clearly dominated (Payne et al., 1988). We identify
one qualification of this prediction, showing that noncompensatory processing strategies can also perform well for nondominated option pairs; namely when a risk-reward relationship is present in the global set that gamble pairs are drawn
from. Researchers have studied the influence such contextual factors before. Birnbaum (1992) found that participants’
certainty equivalents for gambles were larger when a set of
certainty equivalents to choose from was positively skewed
(vs. negatively skewed). In addition, the marginal distributions of payoffs, probabilities and delays can account for
psycho-economic functions that are often described in the literature (Stewart, Chater, & Brown, 2006). Here, we extend
such considerations by manipulating the joint distribution of
payoffs and probabilities.
Several limitations of the current study should be mentioned. First, it is currently unclear what underlies the strong
individual differences in noncompensatory/compensatory
strategy use in each condition. Potentially, some participants
did not perceive a time limit of 3s as pressing enough to opt
for noncompensatory strategies, or turned to different simplification strategies. Overall, the dichotomous distinction between compensatory and noncompensatory processors may
be too simplistic: For instance, some individuals attended to
three attributes on average (i.e., more than one class of attributes such as two payoffs, one probability). Another possibility is that users of a noncompensatory strategy fixated
on some but glanced the other attributes (covert attention),
or changed strategies across trials. Lastly, more research is
needed to study the process by which people learn about different risk-reward structures (Klayman, 1988).

Conclusion
People’s choices and processing strategies are impacted by
the risk-reward structure in a given environment. Specifically,
correlated risk-reward environments allow decision makers
to use noncompensatory strategies when they need to reduce
processing demands. This strategy use is adaptive, given that
it does not need to compromise accuracy if it matches the environment. Many natural environments exhibit an inverse relationship between payoffs and probabilities that can thus be

exploited in a similar way, when time or cognitive resources
are limited. These findings challenge theories of decision
making under risk, that often treat payoffs and probabilities
as independent attributes determining the value of an option.
In comparison, an adaptive decision maker may often have
good ecological reasons to process payoffs and probabilities
dependently.
