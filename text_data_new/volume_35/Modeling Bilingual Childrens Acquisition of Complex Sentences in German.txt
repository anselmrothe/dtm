Abstract
Although Bilingual First Language Acquisition research has
increased considerably over the past few decades, there is still
much controversy regarding the rate of development, i.e. the
question whether bilinguals lag behind their monolingual
peers in various aspects of language. Some studies have found
similar rates of development, whereas others have found that
bilingual children lag behind their monolingual peers. The
current study contributes to this discussion of (dis)similar
rates of development by investigating bilingual children’s
acquisition of German complex sentence constructions
involving adverbial clauses (ACs). Our findings are consistent
with usage-based approaches to language acquisition, which
predict that bilingual acquisition should proceed slower due to
learners having less exposure, on average, to each language.

Introduction
Bilingual First Language Acquisition (BFLA)
There has been an increasing interest in early bilingual
language acquisition. Commonly, this interest involves the
question of whether the cognitive and developmental path
(course of development) and time course (rate of
development) of language learning by bilingual children is
the same as that of their monolingual peers. Although
prevailing theoretical models of language acquisition have
different views regarding the influence of endogenous and
exogenous factors on the acquisition of abstract linguistic
structures and patterns, they agree upon the idea that
monolingual and bilingual language learning is qualitatively
equivalent in that children go through the same series of
developmental phases, starting off with single word
productions, followed by two and multi-word utterances
before they finally develop the capacity to produce complex
sentences (de Houwer, 1995, 2009; Meisel, 1986). Prior
research comparing the rate of development in monolingual
and bilingual learners has produced somewhat mixed

Usage-based (UB) theories belong to a family of
emergentist models, which assume that the development of
language competence is contingent on the experience with
language (O’Grady, 2008; Tomasello, 2003; Lieven, &
Tomasello, 2008). A conservative assumption about BFLA
is that bilingual children, on average, receive less language
input per language than their monolingual peers. UBtheories thus predict that reduction in overall exposure to a
language should negatively affect children’s rate of
acquisition (Gathercole, & Hoff, 2007; Paradis, Nicoladis,
Crago, Genesee, 2011).

Usage-based theory and the acquisition of complex
sentences
Complex sentences are grammatical assemblies consisting
of multiple clauses. Two types of clauses are distinguished:
(i) sentences including coordinate clauses and (ii) sentences
including a matrix clause and a subordinate clause. Complex
sentences containing subordinate clauses can be further
subdivided into three basic sub-types: constructions with
complement clauses, relative clauses and adverbial clauses.
The most comprehensive study on the acquisition of
complex sentences framed within UB-theory is Diessel
(2004). Diessel proposes that complex sentences develop
through two different types of processes: Complex

3753

sentences involving complement and relative clause
constructions develop through a process termed clause
expansion. Complex sentences containing adverbial clauses
develop through a process termed clause integration, in
which two independent sentences are merged into a single
bi-clausal unit. The earliest adverbial clauses produced by
children are thus free-standing (isolated) clauses introduced
by an adverbial subordinator, which are only pragmatically
linked to a previous utterance. Over time, children learn to
elaborate these structures and integrate them with a matrix
clause. The last step in mastering complex sentences
involves developing the capacity to produce sentence initial
subordinate clauses, which impose greater demands on
(verbal) working memory as initial clauses require that the
producer has planned the entire complex structure at the
onset of the utterance (Gibson, 1998; Hawkins, 2004;
Temperley, 2007). Initial adverbial clauses thus develop
later and their frequency, at first, is limited to specific
subordinators. Another finding of Diessel’s (2004) study is
that children’s early productions of complex sentences are
tied to specific lexical expressions. The emergence of more
schematic representations of such constructions takes place
only after children have been exposed to a sufficient number
of types to generalize over. This is reflected in the fact that
children only gradually elaborate their repertoire of
adverbial subordinators and overextend already learned
types to situations where those types are semantically
inadequate (e.g. use of a causal subordinator to express
concessive or other adverbial relations). Two additional,
more general indicators of language proficiency are the
mastery of syntactic differences in German main and
subordinate clause (verb second in main clauses vs. verbfinal positioning in subordinate clauses) (cf. Clahsen &
Muyskens, 1986; Miller, 1976; Park, 1981; Roeper, 1973)
and mean length of utterance (MLU). MLU has been shown
to be an important measurement of a child’s gross language
development and was found to correlate with the
development of morphological and syntactic skills in young
children (Brown, 1973; Parker, & Brorson, 2005). Building
on this research, the present study sets out to derive
statements about differences in the rate of development of
complex sentence constructions from measurements of five
indicators of language proficiency:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Proportion of isolated/integrated adverbial clauses
Proportion of sentence-initial adverbial clauses
Proportion of misused subordinators
Proportion of correct verb position in sub clause
(Log) length of adverbial construction (MLU)

Method
All relevant data were elicited by having children watch a
6.5 minutes episode of a popular stop-motion animated
children’s television series. The children were then given a
visual cue to a particular scene and asked to describe what
happened in that scene. The children’s’ responses were
audio-recorded and transcribed.

Participants
A total of 50 children from 4 to 6 years old participated in
the study: 25 bilingual child participants (German in
combination with another language) and a control group
consisting of 25 monolingual children. 1 All bilingual
children have started learning both languages before the age
of three (McLaughlin, 1984). The children participating in
the study were selected from several kindergartens with
families from different socioeconomic backgrounds (SES;
low SES (~5%), middle SES (~75%), high SES (~20%).
The final proportional distributions of monolingual and
bilingual children across these three categories exhibit
minor, statistically insignificant asymmetries (the proportion
of bilinguals was a little greater than expected assuming
statistical independence in high and low SES categories).
All parents and kindergartens, agreed to participate in the
study.

Data
The elicitation procedure resulted in 27,301 word tokens
produced by monolingual learners and 21,023 word tokens
produced by bilingual learners. From these corpora, all
instances of the target constructions were extracted by way
of manual inspection of the corpus data, yielding a total of
1,023 data points (601 from monolinguals, 422 from
bilinguals). The extracted data were annotated with
information pertaining to the indicators of language
competency listed in the preceding section. Table 1 presents
relevant descriptive statistics of the sample.

The language proficiency levels of the monolingual and
bilingual children were compared with respect to five
indicators of language proficiency. To test whether and to
what extent the proficiency levels of mono- and bilingual
learners differ, we asked: Does competence indicator x
differ significantly between bilingual and monolingual
children after controlling for age? The data were analyzed
using linear and logit mixed effects models in which each of

the five indicators of language proficiency was modeled as a
function of the Boolean predictor BILINGUAL (monolingual
vs. bilingual), a control variable AGE (measured in months)
and SUBJECT as a random effect.2. We checked for normality
and homogeneity by visual inspections of plots of residuals
against fitted values. For all models, the significance of the
predictor BILINGUAL was assessed through model
comparison: For each model, we conducted likelihood ratio
tests to see if a model including BILINGUAL is significantly
better than the corresponding model containing only AGE
and the random effect (SUBJECT).

Discussion
Prior research into the rate of bilingual and monolingual
development has produced somewhat inconclusive results.
While some studies have found similar rates of
development, other studies found that bilingual children lag
behind their monolingual peers in various aspects of
language. Furthermore, the majority of research on the
accuracy of bilingual production has been devoted to earlier
phases of grammatical development such as the acquisition
of the past tense (e.g. Paradis et al., 2011), the acquisition of
mass/count nouns (Gathercole, 2000a) or the acquisition of
grammatical gender (Gathercole, 2000b). Our findings
contribute to this area of research by providing additional
evidence from later stages of grammatical development,
namely complex sentences, which constitute the last
milestone in the acquisition of grammar (cf. Clahsen, 1986).

The research question guiding our analysis was as follows:
Are bilingual children less proficient than their monolingual
peers in the production of German complex sentences with
adverbial clauses? Experience-driven or usage-based
theories of language predict that bilingual children’s
acquisition of complex sentences should proceed slower due
to them having less exposure, on average, to each language.
We tested this general prediction across multiple
dimensions. The five dimensions that served as responses in
our models jointly define the space in which we measured
language proficiency of monolingual and bilingual learners.
We observed that bilinguals in fact lag behind in four out of
five dimensions: their adverbial constructions are shorter,
less often integrated into a complex sentential structure and
when they are integrated, they are less often placed in
sentence-initial position. Furthermore, bilingual productions
exhibited a greater amount of violations of the semantic
usage conditions of adverbial subordinators. This suggests
that bilingual children have not yet developed a very
nuanced set of words to link verbalizations of two events.
Overall, the present work clearly indicates that
bilinguals around age five have not caught up on their
monolinguals peers in the domain of complex sentences.
The only dimension where performance was equivalent
across the two groups concerns the positioning of the finite
verb in German subordinate clauses. However, as both
groups are still quite removed from adult-level performance
(< 80% correct usages in both groups), this finding cannot
be attributed to the children’s having mastered this
grammatical domain. Our results also display a considerable
amount of inter-individual differences as evidenced by
rather pronounced intercept adjustments in the models.
Some bilingual children even outperform some monolingual
children across all dimensions. While some variation is
expected to result from inter-individual differences in
learning performance, prior research suggests that a large
portion of the observed differences may also relate to
various types of group-level differences (cf. Werker, &
Byers-Heinlein, 2008, for an overview). These include
variation due to specific language pairs (Döpke, 2000;
Holm, & Dodd, 1999; Müller, 1999; Müller & Hulk, 2001;
Nicoladis, 2003; Paradis, & Navarro, 2003; Yip &
Matthews, 2000), contexts of exposure (Kazuya, 1998),
social status of the languages (De Houwer, 2007; Pearson,
2007), socioeconomic status (Morton, & Harper 2007), and
language dominance (Cutler, Mehler, Norris, Segui, 1989;
Flege, MacKay, & Piske, 2002; Gathercole, & Môn
Thomas, 2009). Disentangling the effects of these variables
from the effects of an individual’s learning performance is
subject to further investigation.
