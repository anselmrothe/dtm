Abstract
Secondary-level students encounter many difficulties in
learning complex systems with hierarchical levels. Scaffolding
is very critical in teaching complex systems. We have two
complementary research questions on scaffolding: 1. How can
we chunk and sequence the learning activities in teaching
complex systems? 2. How can we help students make
connections across system levels? A simulation-based
environment teaching a chemical system was used as the
research instrument, and the study was conducted at a middle
school setting. The results showed that the sequencing method
following the “from concrete to abstract” principle produced
better recall and comprehension of the system concepts
(knowledge integration), while the sequencing method aligned
with the casual structure of the system facilitated the
construction of a better causal model for transfer. The results
also demonstrated that explicit level-bridging scaffolding had
positive effects on both knowledge integration and learning the
deep causal structure.

Research Background
Complex systems have become an important topic in today’s
science education. It is usually difficult for students to learn
complex systems with hierarchical levels and abstract system
dynamics (Jacobson & Wilensky, 2006). Complex systems
can be difficult from different perspectives. 1). Spatialtemporal extension of a system, e.g., there are many system
levels with complex formation and interactivity 2). Abstract
system levels and causal structures in a system, e.g., higherlevel patterns emerging from lower-level dynamics (Baryam, 1997). Although two types of difficulties always coexist
in various complex systems, one may define the complexity
more than the other in a specific context or at a certain
learning stage. Biological and natural systems often have
many system levels, diversified local behaviors and
interactivity (Hmelo-silver & Azevedo, 2006). For example,
the human circulatory system has a “downward tree”
structure with a large number of elements, and varied local
element interactivity. Effective knowledge integration is a
learning difficulty students have to conquer before learning
the emergent processes involved in this type of system.
Abstract levels and causal structures are often found in

chemical and physics systems (Stieff, 2011). For example, it
is difficult to visualize “voltage in an electric circuit”
emerging from electrons’ behaviors and “gas pressure” from
gas molecular activities.
Agent-based modeling and visualizing tools can create
visual acuity of system levels and demonstrate cross-level
dynamics (Levy & Wilensky, 2009). However, given the
complex nature of the learning content, mere perceptual
grounding is not sufficient for effective learning. Scaffolding
is a critical factor in learning complex systems (Jacobson et
al., 2011). The first research question of this study: How can
we chunk and sequence the learning activities in teaching
complex systems? There have been contradictory findings to
this question. However, analyzing the learning difficulties
from different perspectives may address the debate over the
sequencing methods.
Knowledge integration refers to students connecting
scientific concepts and normative ideas, and providing
coherent explanations to scientific phenomena (Linn, 2006).
From the perspective of knowledge integration, the “topdown” approach starting from the concrete macro-level
function of a system is effective. In Liu & Hmelo-Silver
(2009)’s study, participants learned the respiratory system
with either the “top-down” or the “bottom-up” sequencing
method, and the results showed that starting from the systemwide function (“how do we breathe”) was better than starting
from the lower-level substructures and entities. As can be
seen, in this type of biological system, a higher-level function
is concrete and easy to understand. And a function is often
realized by the interactivity of a large number of diverse
lower-level substructures. “Making science accessible” as a
knowledge integration guideline informs us that concrete
levels of a topic should come before abstract ones (Linn,
2006). Additionally, a top-down function-oriented
sequencing method provides a good conceptual structure for
knowledge integration (Liu & Hmelo-silver, 2009).
Many studies demonstrate that the “bottom-up” approach
is effective in teaching the implicit and abstract causal
structure (e.g., emergence) of a complex system (Wilenky &
Stroup, 2002). This sequencing method allows students to
experience the causal process of how the small effects of the
micro-level elements can lead to the macro-level patterns.
For example, in the Connected Chemistry Curriculum (Levy
& Wilensky, 2009), the approach is to let students manipulate
and articulate the micro-level entity behaviors (e.g., how a

888

single gas molecule collide with the walls), and then
gradually expand to the emergent processes and phenomena.
It is claimed that the “bottom-up” approach help students
conceptually understand the implicit linkages between the
micro and macro level of the gas phenomena (Levy &
Wilensky, 2009).
While we are chunking and sequencing the tasks, we need
to provide extra scaffolding for students to make connections
across learning activities. Inter-level experience is critical in
learning complex systems (Levy & Wilensky, 2009). Thus
the second research question of this study is: How can we
help students make connections across system levels?
Scaffolding that elicits self-explanation could significantly
improve learning (Chi et al, 1994). Explicit level-bridging
scaffolding such as inter-level questions facilitates selfexplanation, and is an effective strategy in teaching complex
systems (Stieff, 2011). In this study, the effect of explicit
level-bridging scaffolding was tested.

Learning Materials and Instrument
Ideal gas law is a complex chemical system. A concrete
phenomenon such as “an aerosol can explodes when it is
thrown into the fire” can be defined as the “system-wide” or
“pattern-level” function. This level is concrete, observable,
and without complex dynamics. Temperature-pressurevolume relationship is an abstract macro level, which is
analogous to and explains the observable pattern-level
function, thus we define this level as the “mechanism level.”
This level depicts the mechanism of the “can explosion
phenomenon”; meanwhile, this level emerges from the
lower-level molecular activity defined as the “entity level”.
A simulation-based environment with two simulations was
used as the research instrument. The first simulation
visualized the pattern-level function. Students could drag the
fire icon towards the can and observe the can explodes (see
Figure 1). The second simulation (see Figure 2) visualized
the
mechanism
level
(Temperature-pressure-volume
relationship) and the entity level (molecular activity). The
two simulations could be displayed separately on two pages.
Students could switch to either simulation by clicking an
arrow button, or they could be displayed on the same page
and dynamically linked (see Figure 3). The dynamic link
technique can facilitate information integration from multiple
representations (van der Meji & de Jong, 2006), and in this
study, it was a part of the manipulation of the explicit levelbridging scaffolding condition.

Variables & Hypotheses
Two variables were tested in this study: 1. Sequencing
methods; 2. Level-bridging scaffolding.

Sequencing Methods
Three sequencing methods were compared in this study. The
sequencing methods variable was manipulated by changing
the delivery order of the three levels of the chemical system.
F-M-E sequencing method Starting from the function level
to the mechanism level, and then to the entity level (F-M-E).
This sequencing method followed the “from concrete to
abstract” principle. It was function-oriented thus provided a
good conceptual framework for knowledge integration.
E-M-F sequencing method Starting from the entity level to
the mechanism level, and then to the function level (E-M-F).
This sequencing method followed the “from cause to effect”
principle because it was aligned with the causal structure of
the ideal gas law system
M-E-F sequencing method Starting from the mechanism
level to the entity level, and then to the function level (M-EF). This sequencing method did not follow the “from
concrete to abstract” or the “from cause to effect” principle,
thus it was hypothesized to be less effective than the other
two methods.

Hypotheses on Sequencing Methods
Hypothesis 1 the F-M-E sequencing method produces better
knowledge integration when compared to the E-M-F and the
M-E-F sequencing method.

Procedure
Within each classroom, participants were randomly assigned.
The data collection within each class was operated on two
consecutive days. The total length of the two sessions was
around 100 minutes.
Day 1 All participants took a pretest. Within the same
classroom, participants were randomly paired up and
randomly assigned to a condition. Each pair was assigned a
laptop with the simulations; and each participant was
assigned a booklet with 6 learning activities. Participants
were asked to read the guidance and questions on the
worksheets and write down their answers without any group
discussion (for better control of extraneous factors). Three
research assistants and the science teacher were present to
monitor the learning progress, help change the simulation
interfaces and solve technical problems. Participants
completed 3-4 learning activities on Day 1.

Measures

Posttest Scores

Pretest The pretest included two open-ended questions
asking the participants to explain two ideal gas law problems:
“using an ice pack to reduce tooth pain” and “car tires are
more likely to explode in the summer than in the winter”. No
extra system information about ideal gas law was provided,
as priming the participants with any level of the system might
disrupt the manipulation of the sequencing methods.

Knowledge integration was measured through recall and
comprehension tasks (Part I, II, III), and understanding of the
deep causal structure was measured through transfer tasks
(Part IV). ANCOVA and helmert contrasts were conducted
as inferential tests.

Posttest. The posttest included four parts. Part I. short
answer questions and labeling questions measuring recall of
system knowledge. Part II. Two snapshots of the virtual
experiment simulation were provided, participants were
asked to describe what happened from Time A to time B.
This open-ended question measured recall of simulation
events; Part III. Four open-ended questions measured
comprehension of the system knowledge, e.g., participants
were asked to explain their understanding of “gas pressure”,
and “why the aerosol can explodes”. Part IV. The same two
ideal gas law problems as in the pretest were used as transfer
questions. This part measured understanding of the deep
causal structure of the system.
Most of the questions in the pre and posttest were openended questions. Participants’ answers were coded on the
absence or presence of important system knowledge units.
All possible knowledge units were included in the coding
scheme (possible maximum scores were high), but
participants’ actual scores were relatively low.
Two raters blind to the conditions coded the answers
independently, and the inter-rater reliability was above 95%
for all parts of the pre and posttest. Disagreement was
resolved via discussion between the two raters.

Part I. Recall of system knowledge (possible maximum
score= 8) Two statistical outliers were converted to the 98percentile value of the sample distribution. Descriptive data
of this part please see Table 4 and Figure 4. Pretest scores as
a covariate was marginally significant, F(1, 116)=3.36,
p=0.069. No interaction between sequencing methods and
level-bridging scaffolding was found, F(2, 116)=0.212,
p=0.847, indicating the F-M-E sequencing method and
explicit level-bridging scaffolding had additive effects on the
recall of system knowledge. The Helmert contrasts results
showed that the F-M-E sequencing method produced
significantly better recall when compared to the average of
the other two sequencing methods, t(116)=2.56, p=0.012; no
significant difference was found between the E-M-F and the
M-E-F sequencing method, t(116)=0.13, p=0.894. This
demonstrated that the “top-down” function-oriented
sequencing method following the “concrete to abstract”
principle (F-M-E) provided a desirable conceptual
framework for knowledge integration. Explicit level-bridging
scaffolding had significant positive effects on the recall of
system knowledge, F(1, 116)=7.24, p=0.008. The results
supported Hypothesis 1 and 3.

Results
Pretest Scores
The possible maximum score of the pretest was 10. Pretest
scores did not significantly differ across sequencing methods,
F(2, 117)=0.674, p=0,512; or across level-bridging
scaffolding conditions, F(1, 117)=0.238, p=0.789. The pretest
scores were used to establish equivalency and used as a
covariate in further analysis.

Different from the comprehension questions in Part III, these
two transfer questions required participants to recognize the
problems as ideal gas law phenomena, and transfer the causal
structure of the system to explain the problems. Two
statistical outliers were converted to the 98-percentile value
of the sample distribution. Descriptive data of this part please

the same as the pretest questions. The mean pre-post gain
was 0.68, SD=1.33, which was significantly different from 0,
t (122)=5.66, p<.001. However, the low pre-post gain
indicated that transfer was inherently difficult.
The E-M-F sequencing method with explicit level-bridging

Conclusion
Scaffolding is critical in teaching complex systems. Different
sequencing methods as procedural scaffolding were
compared in this study. The F-M-E sequencing method
which followed the “concrete to abstract” sequencing
principle produced better knowledge integration. The E-M-F
sequencing method which followed the “cause to effect”
principle produced better understanding of the deep causal
structure only when explicit level-bridging scaffolding was
provided. The M-E-F sequencing which did not follow either
principle was not very effective for either knowledge
integration or understanding of the deep causal structure.
These findings are valuable as they address the “top-down”
vs. “bottom-up” debate in teaching complex systems. When
teaching systems with many levels and detailed system
dynamics, effective knowledge integration is very essential at
an early stage, thus the “top-down” approach starting from
concrete macro-level functions may produce better
performance. While in teaching complex systems with
abstract and implicit causal structures, a sequencing method
aligned with the causal structure of the system may help
learners construct better mental models for transfer. Different
sequencing methods can be used in different contexts or at
different learning stages.
