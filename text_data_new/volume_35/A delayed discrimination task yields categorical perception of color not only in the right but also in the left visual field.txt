Abstract
Whether categorical perception of color is lateralized in the
left cerebral hemisphere (e.g., Gilbert, Regier, Kay, & Ivry,
2006) or not (e.g., Witzel & Gegenfurtner, 2011) is still
controversial. This ongoing debate, however, has been studied
with visual search tasks, which seemed to produce residual
laterality effects. The present study assessed whether a
delayed discrimination task with divided visual field method,
rather than visual search tasks, yields lateralized or bilateral
categorical perception of color. The results showed an
advantage for between-category discrimination relative to
within-category discrimination. Such an advantage,
importantly, was obtained in the left visual field as well as in
the right visual field. These results suggest categorical
perception of color is bilateral and not lateralized. Combining
recent studies with visual search tasks (e.g., Witzel &
Gegenfurtner, 2011), our results would provide further
evidence for bilateral categorical perception, and thus throw
doubt on the laterality effects of categorical perception.
Keywords: categorical perception; color perception; delayed
discrimination task

Introduction
A growing number of studies have shown that categorical
perception (better discrimination of the stimuli from
adjacent categories than those from the same category) of
color (e.g., Roberson & Davidoff, 2000; Suegami &
Michimata, 2010; Wiggett & Davis, 2008; Winawer et al.,
2007). In a seminal study, Gilbert, Regier, Kay, and Ivry
(2006) employed a visual search task, where a colored target
was detected faster when the target and distracters belonged
to different color categories than when the target was in the
same color category as the distracters (i.e., categorical
perception). However, such a categorical perception of color
was observed only when the target appeared in the right
visual field (RVF) but not in the left visual field (LVF).
Some successive studies, either behavioral studies (e.g.,
Drivonikou, et al., 2007) or imaging study with fMRI (Siok
et al., 2009), obtained a stronger categorical perception in
the RVF relative to LVF. Since the RVF is projected to the
left cerebral hemisphere (LH), which is thought to be a
center of verbal processing, the results would apparently

reflect the fact that categorical perception is verbally
mediated.
Meanwhile, some other studies suggested that lateralized
categorical perception in the RVF could be interpreted in
terms of other general cognitive mechanisms supported by
the LH, rather than simply verbal or language-related
processing. Holmes and Wolff (2012), for instance, showed
that not only labeled objects but also unlabeled objects
produced categorical perception in the RVF on a visual
search task. They attributed such a categorical perception in
the RVF to an LH’s advantage in qualitative or “categorical”
processing (cf, Hellige & Michimata, 1989; Kosslyn et al.,
1989; Laeng, Chabris, & Kosslyn, 2003).
The debate about the origin of the LH-lateralized
categorical perception is ongoing and resolving such a
debate may be of importance for the understanding of the
nature of categorical perception. It should be noted,
however, that such laterality effects could also result from
some other residual factors. Some recent studies (Brown,
Lindsey, & Guckes, 2011; Witzel & Gegenfurtner, 2011),
for instance, showed that when using the same visual color
search tasks as the previous studies but correcting some
methodological weakness of previous studies, such as color
production or eye movements, yielded categorical
perception of color in the LVF as well as RVF.
Another concern could be brought in regard to the tasks;
the LH-lateralized categorical perception was predominantly
obtained with visual search tasks (e.g., Brown et al., 2011;
Drivonikou et al., 2007; Gilbert et al., 2006; Gilbert et al.,
2008; Holmes & Wolff, 2012; Roberson, Pak, & Hanley,
2008; Siok et al., 2009; Witzel & Gegenfurtner, 2011).
Visual search tasks seem to be suitable for examining
categorical “perception,” since this kind of tasks would have
little memory demands. In the visual search tasks, however,
one can also find some factors that might confound the
results. In all of the visual search tasks we reviewed,
participants were asked to judge which side (i.e., left or
right) did the target appear in, and made their responses by
hitting the keys associated with target’s position (i.e., left or
right key). Since judging left or right side is in the nature of

3480

the “categorical” spatial relation processing, which is better
processed in the LH (Hellige & Michimata, 1989; Hellige,
Laeng, & Michimata, 2010; Jager & Postma, 2003; Kosslyn
et al., 1989; Laeng, Chabris, & Kosslyn, 2003), this kind of
tasks would produce residual laterality effects. The visual
search tasks, moreover, seem to consist of detection of the
target among distractors. Kitterle, Christman, and Hellige
(1990) argued that laterality for the spatial frequency
processing could be obtained in an identification task (or a
delayed discrimination task) but not in a detection task.
Although it is not clear whether laterality for categorical
perception and these other types of “categorical” processing
share the same mechanisms (c.f., Franklin, Drivonikou,
Bevis, Davies, Kay, & Regier, 2008; Holmes & Wolff,
2012; Suegami & Laeng, 2013), employing the visual
search task, which seems to be another variation of a
detection task, might diminish or cancel the lateralization of
categorical perception. Thus, one could argue that some
recent studies (Brown et al., 2011; Witzel & Gegenfurtner,
2011) failed to replicate LH-lateralized categorical
perception since laterality effects were cancelled out by
residual factors.
Thus, the present study aimed to provide further evidence
for either LH-lateralized or bilateral categorical perception
of color by means of a delayed discrimination task with
divided visual field method, rather than the visual search
tasks (e.g., Drivonikou et al., 2007; Gilbert et al., 2006). The
delayed discrimination task employed here was the classical
method for exploring an LH’s advantage in categorical
processing of spatial relations and patterns (e.g., Hellige &
Michimata, 1989; Kosslyn et al, 1989; Saneyoshi &
Michimata, 2009; Suegami & Laeng, 2013). Following
previous studies (e.g., Siok et al., 2009), four colors with a
constant color difference in CIE L* u* v* perceptually
uniform color space were emulated. The experiment
consisted of an initial training for eye-fixation (GuzmanMartinez, Leung, Franconeri, Grabowecky, & Suzuki, 2009)
and two main tasks: a delayed discrimination task and a
color categorization task.
In the delayed discrimination task, moreover, two
different lengths of delays (500 ms or 5000 ms) were
employed since both theories for the LH-lateralized
categorical perception expected that such a LH-lateralized
pattern should be enhanced by longer delays. A 5000 ms or
longer delay in the delayed discrimination task would
enhance using verbal codes rather than visual codes (Posner
& Keele, 1967), and also enhance an LH’s advantage in
“categorical” spatial relation processing (Postma, Huntjens,
Meuwissen, & Laeng, 2006).
After the delayed discrimination task, the participants also
took part in a color categorization task to validate the
categories of the four colors. The color categorization task
was conducted after the delayed discrimination task in order
to avoid any biases to the discrimination task.

Method
Participants
Thirty participants were recruited as volunteers for an
experiment on color perception. Each participant received a
gift card for 200 Norwegian Crowns (i.e., about 35 U.S.
dollars). Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971)
and Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test were conducted for
screening out left-handers and individuals with abnormal
color vision.

Apparatus
All the stimuli were presented on a 21-in. CRT monitor with
75 Hz refreshing rate (EIZO Flex Scan T961), connecting
with Apple MacBook Pro (2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo). The
distance between the CRT monitor and participant’s eyes
was fixed in 85.5 cm. The experiment was operated by
MATLAB 2008b with Psychophysics Toolbox 3 (Brainard,
1997). A 10-key pad was connected to the computer and
served as a response console. Both the training and two
main tasks were conducted in a dark room.

Stimuli
Eye-fixation training The stimuli in the original training
task (Guzman-Martinez et al., 2009) were closely duplicated.
Two circles of 17.27° (visual angle) diameter, filled with
black and white random-dot pattern or its contrast-reversed
pattern, were created. Each of the two circle had 1.00° by
1.00° of a black fixation cross at its center.
Delayed discrimination task Four colors used in the
previous studies (e.g., Siok et al., 2009) were emulated.
Each adjacent pair had approximately constant distance in
the CIE L* u* v* color space. Two of them ought to belong
to blue category and other two to green (hereafter, the four
colors were termed as Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 2, and Green 1
respectively). The CIE L* u* v* coordinates for each color
were measured by means of Datacolor Spyder 4 ELITE
(CIE L* u* v* coordinates for each color were listed on
Table 1). The mean color difference (ΔE in CIE L* u* v*
space) of within-category pairs was 17.76, and slightly
larger than the ΔE for the between-category pair (17.10).
Four color patches of 2.00° by 2.00° and a hairline
fixation cross of 1.00° by 1.00° were created as the stimuli.
Each color patch had one of the 4 colors, and the fixation
cross was depicted by the neutral orange color which had
approximately constant distance from all of the 4 colors in
terms of CIE L* u* v* coordinates.
Color categorization task The same color patches as the
delayed discrimination task were employed as the stimuli.

Procedure
Eye-fixation training The procedure was based on the
original work by Guzman-Martinez et al. (2009). Each

3481

participant was seated in front of the CRT monitor, and
fixed her/his eyes into the fixation cross. Participant’s
hitting the appropriate key led to 5000 ms of 37.5 Hz
flickering presentation of the two random-dots circles. The
participant was instructed that random-dots circles would
turn into an uniform gray circle if her/his eyes were fixed
into the fixation cross. After 5000 ms of flickering
presentation, the participant could take a short break, and
was allowed to start next trial by her/his own pace. The
training had 30 trials and took approximately 5 min.
Delayed discrimination task After the eye-fixation training,
the participant took part in the delayed discrimination task.
The apparatus was identical to those for the eye-fixation
training.
Typical trial sequence was shown in the Figure 1. Each
trial began with 200 ms of a fixation cross against black
background. Then two identical color patches filled with
one of the 4 colors appeared 3.9° left and right from the
center as probes1, and a blank screen followed for 300 ms or
4800 ms. After the blank, a fixation cross appeared again for
200 ms (therefore, the ISI was 500 ms or 5000 ms), and then
target color patch was presented 3.9° left or right from the
center for 200 ms. The target could have an adjacent color
or the same color as the probes. The participant judged if the
color of the target was identical to that of the probes by
hitting the left or right key as quickly as s/he could. A half
of the participants hit the left key if the target and probes
had the same color, and the other half hit the right key
instead. Response times (RTs) were recorded from the onset
of the target. If no response occurred until 2000 ms had
elapsed from the onset, the trial was classified as an error.
After a response had been made or 2000 ms had elapsed, the
next trial started through a 1500 ms of inter trial interval.
Twenty trials constituted an experimental block. The length
of the ISI was manipulated between the experimental blocks.
Half of the participants performed 10 blocks with 500 ms of
ISI first, and then another 10 blocks with 5000 ms of ISI
second. Another half of the participants performed each 10
blocks in reversed order.
For both ISI conditions, a practice block was held before
starting each task. In the practice block, each trial had
instant feedback, and another block was repeated if the
accuracy rate of the block had not reached 65.0%.
Color categorization task After the delayed discrimination
task, a color categorization task took place. In each trial, a
color patch filled with one of the 4 colors appeared in the
center. The participant judged if the color was blue or green
by manual response. The color patch was presented until the
response had been made (with no time limitation). The
participant could take a short break after each 20 trials, and
the whole task consisted in a total of 100 trials.

The probes were presented left and right from the center of the
screen simultaneously, ensuring that the probes and the target had
identical retinal eccentricity.

discrimination task.

Results
Eight participants were excluded from the analysis. One of
them did not get a score above +50 on the Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory and therefore was ruled out for
excluding potential left-handed or mix-handed (see
Dragovik, 2004). Another showed significant positive
correlation between accuracies and RTs ( 𝒓   =    +. 𝟗𝟏 ),
suggesting a speed-accuracy trade-off. Three participants
were screened out due to their abnormal scores on the
Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test. Other three showed
atypical categories of color; the boundary between blue and
green category did locate at between blue 1 and blue 2,
instead of between blue 2 and green 2 (see Gilbert et al.,
2006). Thus, the data from the remaining 22 participants
were employed for the statistical analysis. Six of them were
native Norwegian speakers, five were Lithuanian speakers,
two were Chinese and two were English, and each of the
other participants spoke, respectively, Bosnian, French,
Italian, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish as a
native language. Fifteen of them were female, and the mean
age of the participants was 27.76 years (SD = 5.32). The
mean score on the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was
91.57 (SD = 9.06).

Color categorization task
The rates of the trials in which the color was categorized
“blue” were calculated for all of the four colors (Table 1).
One-sample t-tests for each rate revealed that all the rates
were significantly different form the chance level of 50.0%,
ps < .001. That is, both of blue 1 and blue 2 were
categorized as “blue” robustly, and likewise both of green 2
and green 1 were categorized as “green.” These results
confirmed that blue 1 and blue 2 indeed belonged to “blue”
category, and likewise green 2 and green 1 were belonged
to “green” category.

Delayed discrimination task
Accuracy As indices of accuracies, A´s (Aaronson & Watts,
1987; Pollack & Norman, 1964) were employed instead of
error rates, so as to exclude possible participants’ response
bias (see also Pilling et al., 2003). A´s for within- and
between-category pairs with two ISI conditions were
calculated for each visual field (panel a and b in Figure 2).
The A´s were analyzed by a three-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with category (within-category or
between-category), visual field (LVF or RVF), and ISI (500
ms of ISI or 5000 ms of ISI) as within-participants factors.
As the most important result, a significant effect of category
was obtained, 𝐹(1, 21)    =   28.40, 𝑀𝑆𝐸   =    0.06!! , 𝑝   <
  .001, 𝜂!! =    .58, reflecting that the A´ for the betweencategory discrimination was larger than that for the withincategory discrimination (i.e., categorical perception of
color). A main effect of visual field was also significant,
𝐹 1, 21 =   11.12, 𝑀𝑆𝐸   =    0.03!! , 𝑝 =    .003, 𝜂!! =    .35 ,
revealing that the A´ in the LVF was larger than that in the
RVF. An interaction between category and visual field,
moreover, was significant. Post hoc t-tests revealed the A´
for the between-category discrimination was larger than that
for the within-category discrimination in the RVF,
𝑡 21 =   3.75, 𝑝 =    .001, 𝑑   =   0.60, and also in the LVF as
well, 𝑡 21 =   5.53, 𝑝 <    .001, 𝑑   =   1.06. The A´ for the
between-category discrimination was larger in the LVF than
that in the RVF, 𝑡 21 =   3.90, 𝑝 =    .001, 𝑑   =   0.63 ,
whereas no significant difference was found between in the
A´ for the within-category discrimination in the LVF and
RVF, 𝑡 21 =   1.01, 𝑝 =    .326, 𝑑   =   0.12 . These results
suggest that the categorical perception of color was obtained
not only in the RVF but also in the LVF, and, unexpectedly,
such a category perception was observed stronger in the

LVF instead of the RVF. Neither any other main effects nor
interactions was significant, 𝑝   >    .175, 𝜂!! <    .09.
Response Time Median RTs for correct responses were
also calculated for within- and between-category pairs with
two ISI conditions in both visual fields (panel c and d in
Figure 2).
The RTs were also analyzed by the same three-way
ANOVA as the accuracies. In line with the results in the
accuracies, a main effect of category was again significant,
𝐹 1, 21 =   12.78, 𝑀𝑆𝐸   =   9104.76, 𝑝 =    .002, 𝜂!! =    .38 .
This main effect reflects that the RTs for the betweencategory discrimination were shorter than that for the
within-category discrimination. Post hoc t-tests revealed the
RTs for the between-category discrimination were
significantly shorter than that for the within-category
discrimination in the RVF, 𝑡 21 =   2.80, 𝑝 =    .011, 𝑑   =
  0.28, and also in the LVF, 𝑡 21 =   2.43, 𝑝 =    .024, 𝑑   =
  0.32. These results, in accordance with the results in the
accuracies, suggest that categorical perception of color was
found in the LH as well as in the RH. A significant main
effect of ISI was also found, not surprisingly, 𝐹 1, 21 =
  36.45, 𝑀𝑆𝐸   =   25739.96, 𝑝 <    .001, 𝜂!! =    .63 , revealing
that the RTs with 500 ms of ISI were shorter than those with
5000 ms of ISI. Any other effects or interactions failed to be
significant, 𝑝   >    .203, 𝜂!! <    .08.

panels on lower line) for within- and between-category pairs.
The left panels show A´s and RTs with 500 ms of ISI (panel

with 5000 ms of ISI (panel b and d, respectively). Each error
bar shows ±1 standard error.

Discussion
The present study aimed to assess whether, by means of a
delayed discrimination task, one would observe a LH-

3483

lateralized categorical perception of color (e.g., Drivonikou
et al., 2007; Gilbert et al., 2006; Siok et al., 2009) or
bilateral categorical perception (Brown et al., 2011; Witzel
& Gegenfurtner, 2011). In such a delayed discrimination
task, we found evidence for bilateral but not LH-lateralized
categorical perception. We employed the same color set as
some of the previous studies that had found a LH-lateralized
categorical perception (e.g., Siok et al., 2009). The results
from the categorization task confirmed that both of blue and
green categories in the present study were well established.
Thus, such bilateral categorical perceptions could not be
attributed to the color difference itself, and they confirm
recent studies also showing bilateral categorical perception
of color (Brown et al., 2011; Witzel & Gegenfurtner, 2011).
Interestingly, an unexpected RH-lateralized categorical
perception was obtained in terms of accuracies. A possible
account for this “reversed” laterality effects could be the
RH’s advantage in color processing (e.g., Levy &
Trevarthen, 1981; Pennal, 1977). Importantly, this result
presents another example of counter evidence for the
hypothesis of a LH-lateralized categorical perception.
One could argue that the present study failed to replicate
the LH-lateralized categorical perception merely due to
employing a different task than the typical visual search.
This is plausible, but this reasoning contradicts the idea that
either an LH’s advantage in verbal processing or a
hemispheric specialization in “categorical” processing
underlies the LH-lateralized categorical perception effect. In
fact, an LH’s advantage in both verbal (Posner & Keele,
1967) and categorical spatial processing (Postma, et al.,
2006) is typically enhanced with longer time intervals, as in
a delayed discrimination task. Moreover, a delayed
discrimination task would seem more suitable for obtaining
laterality effects than the tasks with no memory demands,
like the visual search tasks (Kitterle et al., 1990). Therefore
it could be argued that the present task should have been
more likely to yield laterality effects on categorical
perception than the previous visual search tasks. However,
we failed to observe any sign of a LH-lateralized categorical
perception in the current study. Thus, the present results are
best interpreted as supporting the conclusion that categorical
perception of color is represented bilaterally in the brain.
One possible weakness of the present study may be due to
the large variety of participants’ mother languages in our
sample. Several studies have reported that people may
possess different color categories in their native languages
and consequently this could yield different patterns of
categorical perception of color (e.g., Winawer et al., 2007)
or its lateralization (e.g., Roberson et al., 2008). However,
we took care to confirm that all of our participants shared
the same color categories, and we found evidence that only
three participants showed atypical categorical structures.
Moreover, the native languages of all participants (except
excluded three participants) distinguish between green and
blue at the lexical level. According to the previous studies
(e.g., Roberson, Davies, & Davidoff, 2000), it is when the
native languages do not distinguish, for example, blue from

green that these individuals would also show different
patterns of category effects. As mentioned in the Results
section, moreover, three participants were excluded since
their categorical boundary located at between blue 1 and
blue 2, instead of blue 2 and green 2. For these participants,
two of them were Russian and the other was Turkish.
Previous studies showed that Russian (Winawer et al., 2007)
and Turkish (Özgen & Davies, 1997) have different
structures of blue category relative to native English
speakers. The fact that those participants with different color
structures in their native languages indeed showed different
categorical structures in the categorization task indicates
that the results of the categorization task adequately reflect
participants’ categorical structures. Thus, these results could
provide another moderate support for that the participants
employed in current analysis shared the same category
structures to a satisfactory extent.
In conclusion, the present study revealed bilateral
categorical perception with a delayed discrimination task.
Although the delayed discrimination task has memory
components and therefore could be less appropriate for
examining “perception,” such a task has the advantage to
exclude residual laterality effects caused by previous visual
search tasks (e.g., residual categorical spatial processing
caused by left/right judgments). Combining recent studies
employed visual search tasks with correcting some other
methodological flaws (Brown et al., 2011; Witzel &
Gegenfurtner, 2011), our results provide further evidence
for bilateral categorical perception, and thus throw doubt on
the laterality effects of categorical perception.
