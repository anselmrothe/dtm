Klatzy, Wu, & Stetten (2008) suggest that more
perceptually mediated interfaces allow for better
performance over cognitively mediated interfaces.
Perceptually mediated interfaces decrease demand on spatial
working memory, thereby freeing up cognitive resources to
allocate to performance or learning. If stereo and colocation
increase perceptual mediation, decrease spatial cognitive
load, and allow for additional cognitive recourses to be
devoted to performance, then participants should show
faster and more accurate performance when these cues are
provided.

Abstract
Virtual models are a common instructional tool used in
chemistry education to help students learn about the 3D
structure of molecules. The present study examined effects of
two interface design features on participant performance
during a molecule orientation task. The features examined
were 1) colocation of the visual and haptic workspace and 2)
stereoscopic viewing. The results indicate that colocating the
interface increased participant accuracy, while providing
stereo did not. Neither factor affected response time. The
effects of colocation were also reflected in subjective ratings
of task demand measured by the NASA-TLX. Spatial ability
was predictive of task performance but did not interact with
interface effects. The findings are discussed in the context of
spatial cognition and interface design for manipulating virtual
objects.

Stereo and Colocation Technology
Both stereo and colocation technologies have been shown to
increase speed and accuracy in virtual object manipulation
tasks (Ware & Rose, 1999, Arsenault & Ware, 2004,
Klatzky et al., 2008), however some studies have shown no
significant effect of stereo (Khooshabeh & Hegarty, 2010)
or colocation (Liere, 2005). It is important to note that the
majority of studies investigating performance with these
technologies have used object translation tasks, rather than a
rotation task as in the current study. In general, we should
be cautious in generalizing specific interface design effects
across various tasks, as different perceptual cues may be
important for supporting rotation and translation.
To our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects
of varying both stereo and colocation during a virtual object
rotation task in the same experiment. The results of the
present study will help to elucidate the importance of these
cues for increasing perceptual mediation and decreasing
cognitive load in a task that involves virtual object rotation.

Computer-based virtual models are becoming an
increasingly common instructional medium in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
education (Trindade, Fiolhais & Almeida, 2002). Virtual
learning environments have shown promise in fostering
meaningful learning, but virtual models vary considerably in
the perceptual cues and interfaces that they provide so there
is still much to be understood regarding how to best design
and implement these technologies. For example, current
stereoscopic displays are more expensive and less available,
so it is important to know whether they provide a benefit to
performance and learning outcomes, or whether monoscopic
displays are as effective.
The present study aims to understand the relative value
of two factors on which virtual displays vary, (1) colocating
the hand-held interface and the displayed virtual image
(colocation), and (2) providing stereoscopic 3D viewing
(stereo) for a representation matching task in organic
chemistry. Stull, Barrett, & Hegarty (2012), found
participants performed this task with greater efficiency
using a virtual model system (with stereoscopic display and
colocation of visual and haptic workspaces) than when
using standard concrete models. Given this efficiency
advantage, a goal of this study is to investigate the relative
importance of providing stereo and colocation during a
virtual object manipulation task.

Organic Chemistry as a Test-bed
Organic chemistry is a domain rich in spatial representation;
diagrams and models of 3D molecular structures are
ubiquitous in instruction as well as in cutting edge research
environments. Understanding molecular structure is an
essential skill all organic chemists must have in order to
learn, research, and communicate their science. Diagrams
and models serve as a language of spatial connections and
structures and therefore are vital in developing
understanding of structures and making advancements in the
field (Kozma & Russell, 2005).

Organic chemistry representations serve as an excellent
test-bed for studying spatial cognition in virtual
environments for these reasons. Virtual models are
commonly employed in chemistry education (Barnea &
Dori, 2000, Limniou, Roberts & Papadopoulos, 2008) to
teach students about the 3D structure of molecules and to
introduce them to other representations (diagrams, equations
etc.). However, little work has investigated interface design
for virtual models in chemistry. One aim of the present
study is to inform the design of virtual models for chemistry
education, by identifying which visual cues and interface
functionality best support usability and learning with these
models.
The task used in the present study requires that the
participant understand the spatial structure of a 3D
molecular model, then manipulate the model in order to
match to the orientation of a simultaneously displayed
diagram of the same molecule. This task is relevant as it is a
commonly employed activity for teaching about molecular
structure, and also shares similarities with the virtual object
orientation matching tasks used in the human-computer
interaction literature. Grounding the study in the real-world
domain of organic chemistry allows for simultaneous
investigation of applied interface design issues as well as
theories of small scale spatial cognition and virtual object
manipulation.
In addition to performance measures, we assessed selfreports of usability of the virtual models. We predicted that
participants who received stereo and colocation would rate
the interfaces as more usable. Given the spatial nature of
the task and known sex differences in spatial ability (Voyer,
Voyer & Bryden, 1995), we also investigated possible
interactions between aspects of the virtual models, spatial
ability, and sex. If colocation and stereo displays increase
perceptual mediation, we might expect an interaction with
spatial ability such that lower spatial ability participants
should receive a greater benefit from the additional cues
than higher spatial ability participants, who can presumably
better handle more cognitively mediated interfaces. We
might also expect females to benefit more from the
perceptually mediated interface, because they tend to have
lower spatial ability (Voyer et al, 1995) and less experience
with computers (Waller, 2000).

computer mouse location (15” total displacement).
Stereoscopic viewing was provided by Nvidia 3D Vision
Wireless Glasses Kit.
The interface was composed of a cylinder that was
roughly the same dimensions as the virtual models, and
consisted of two halves that freely rotated about the long
axis of the interface. One half contained a 3-degree of
freedom motion sensor to track yaw, pitch, and roll of the
interface, and was used to control global rotations of the
virtual models. The opposite half was attached via an optical
encoder that tracked twisting rotations of the interface
halves, and was used to control local rotations of a bond
within the molecule itself (as was necessary on some of the
experimental trials). Please refer to Stull, Barrett & Hegarty
(2012) for a more detailed description of the system design.

Method
Design
The study had a two (colocation vs. displaced) by two
(stereo vs. mono) between subjects design. Dependent
variables include accuracy as measured by angular error and
response time. Subjective experience ratings, spatial ability,
and computer use were also measured.

Virtual Model System
A ‘fishtank’ virtual reality system was constructed to allow
for colocated naturalistic manipulation of a virtual
molecular model in stereoscopic 3D (Earnst & Banks,
2002). The display was mounted horizontally above the user
and faced downward onto a mirror mounted at 45°, which
projected the virtual image to the viewer. This configuration
allowed the participant to manipulate the input device in the
same location as the perceived virtual image of the model,
giving an experience similar to direct manipulation of a
concrete model. In the displaced condition, the input device

Participants
One hundred twenty college students (65 Female) (age: M =
18.7, SD = 1.8) from the psychology subject pool at a
research university participated in the study in return for
course credit. None of the participants had studied organic
chemistry. All participants had normal, or corrected to
normal vision. Participants were randomly assigned to each
condition.

of these criteria on a scale from 0 to 100 with 0 being the
lowest and 100 being the highest rating.
Participants were administered two tests of spatial ability,
a mental rotation test (MRT) (Vandenburg & Kuse, 1978),
and a three dimensional perspective taking test,
Visualization of Viewpoints (VoV) (Guay & McDaniels,
1976).
Items from Waller’s (2000) computer use questionnaire
were administered to assess participants’ attitudes and
experience with computers. Participants rated 10 statements
on a scale of 1 (completely disagree) through 7 (completely
agree).

The study materials included an informed consent sheet, a
video tutorial, a sheet with descriptions of the task and
diagrams, a set of diagram orientation matching task
problems, a measure of task load, a measure of computer
beliefs and attitudes, two measures of spatial ability, and a
post-task questionnaire.
A 10-minute instructional video explained the
conventions of the models and diagrams, how to find and
understand important features of the model (e.g., central
carbon-carbon bond), how to write the chemical formula for
each molecular subgroup (e.g., CH3 for a methyl group
made up of a carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms), the
color conventions for the different atoms (e.g., black for
carbon, red for oxygen etc.), and how to structurally align
the models to each of the three diagram types.
The diagram problems required rotation of the virtual
model to match one of two commonly used target diagram
types, dash-wedge (side-view) and Newman (end-view).
There were 24 problems total, half with dash-wedge target
diagrams and half with Newman target diagrams. The
starting orientation of the model was such that it maximized
the global angular distance to each of the target diagrams.
Half of the trials involved a conformation change (local
rotation) of the molecular model (i.e., changing the spatial
configuration of substituents by rotating the bond between
the molecule’s two chiral carbons). Six different molecules
were used in the 24 trial problems; and were systematically
varied with the target diagram type, and local rotation trials.
All participants received the trials in the same order, in
which two consecutive trials never showed the same target
diagram or molecule.

Results
The following results include 108 participants (56 female).
Data from 12 students were excluded from the analyses as
they had much lower accuracy (angular errors of >30°)
suggesting they did not understand the task or were
unmotivated. The four interface condition groups had
approximately equal numbers of males and females.
Response times that were greater than 2.5 standard
deviations from a participant’s mean response time were
replaced with their mean response time. The groups did not
significantly differ on the MRT, F(3, 104) = 0.8, p = .56,
VoV, F(3, 104) = 1.7, p = .17, computer experience, F(3,
104) = 0.43, p = .73, or attitudes toward computers, F(3,
104) = 1.0, p = .42.
The mean angular error for the different experimental
groups is shown in Figure 3. Overall, participants had an
average angular error of 13.7° (SD = 6.6). A significant
effect of colocation was found on error, F(1, 104) = 6.6, p
= .01, ηp² = .06. Marginal means showed that participants
provided with the colocated interface had a lower average
angular error (i.e., greater accuracy) of 12.1° (SD = 5.7),
than those using the displaced interface 15.4° (SD = 7.1).
No significant effect of stereo was observed, F(1, 104) =
0.6, p = .46. There was no observed interaction between
colocation and stereo F(1, 104) = 2.5, p = .12.

NASA-TLX ratings are shown in Table 1. On average,
participants provided with a colocated interface rated their
experience as having significantly less physical demand and
frustration than those with the displaced interface. Further,
participants with colocated interfaces rated their own
performance to be significantly greater than those with
displaced interfaces. No main effects of stereo were found
on any of the six task demand ratings.
Significant interactions between stereo and colocation
were observed on ratings of effort, F(1, 104) = 4.3, p = .04,
ηp² = .04, and frustration, F(1, 104) = 8.3, p = .005 ηp² =
.06. When colocation was provided, participants using
stereoscopic displays reported less task effort (M = 58.1, SE
= 4.6) than participants using monoscopic displays (M =
72.3, SE = 4.8). Further, when provided stereo, participants
using colocated interfaces reported less frustration (M =
19.4, SE = 5.1) than those using displaced interfaces (M =
45.6, SE = 5.3).

As shown in Table 2, MRT scores showed small but
significant correlations, while VoV scores showed
somewhat higher correlations with response time and
accuracy. In order to investigate possible interactions
between spatial ability and aspects of the interface and
display, scores from the MRT and VoV were standardized
and averaged to produce a combined spatial ability score. A
median split was used to separate high and low spatial
ability participants, and was then used as a factor in the
analysis. As expected, high spatial ability participants
completed the task faster and had greater accuracy than low
spatial ability participants F(1, 100) = 7.9, p = .006, ηp² =
.07. High spatial ability participants had an average
response time of 29.3s (SD = 12.2) and low spatial ability
participants 38.1s (SD = 16.6). For accuracy, high spatial
ability participants had a lower average angular error of
11.2º (SD = 5.6) than low spatial ability participants 16.2º
(SD = 6.5), this finding was also significant F(1, 100) =
13.2, p = <.001, ηp² = .12. Interactions of spatial ability with
stereo and / or colocation did not reach significance.
Participants’ level of experience with computers showed a
small significant correlation with accuracy, but no
significant correlation with response time. As shown in
Table 2, there were moderate correlations between computer
attitude and experience with both the MRT and VoV scores.
A median-split was used to separate participants into high
and low groups for computer attitude and computer
experience. When used as a factor in the analysis, there was
no main effect of either attitude or experience on
performance. Further, there were no significant interactions
of computer attitude or experience with stereo and / or
colocation.
Overall, males were significantly more accurate than
females, F(1, 106) = 5.1, p = .025, ηp² = .05. Males had an
average angular error of 12.3° (SD = 6.6) and females 15.1°
(SD = 6.3). Males and females did not significantly differ in
response time, F(1, 106) = 0.5, p = .50. However, a
significant interaction of gender with colocation is evident
in response time, F(1, 104) = 5.0, p = .028, ηp² = .05.

Pairwise analysis revealed that female participants
performed significantly faster with a colocated interface (M
= 29.9s, SE = 2.8) than with a displaced interface (M =
39.8s, SE = 2.8), F(1, 104) = 6.2, p = .014, ηp² = .06.
Response times for males were not affected by colocation,
F(1, 104) = 0.4, p = .49. There were no other significant
interactions with gender.

Numerous studies have demonstrated performance
advantages from providing stereoscopic 3D viewing in
virtual object manipulation tasks (Ware & Franck, 1996;
Hu, Hellen, 2000; Arsenault & Ware, 2004; Liere, Kok,
Martens, 2005). However, many of these studies involve
virtual object translation tasks, rather than rotation tasks, as
in the present study. One must use caution in generalizing
effects of interface design on translation tasks to rotation
tasks, as the two processes are independent (Wang,
MacKenzie, Summers, & Booth, 1998; Ware & Rose,
1999). Other studies comparing stereo and mono displays
that involved tasks other than translation often find no
beneficial effect of stereoscopic viewing (Hoffmeister,
Frank, Cuschieri, & Wade 2001, Kooshabeh & Hegarty,
2010).
Another possible explanation for the null result of
providing stereo is that the task had low demand on depth
perception. The task used in the present study was purely an
object rotation task, the models manipulated were regular
structures that rotated around a fixed origin in space, and the
task did not require making difficult judgments about
relative distances in depth. The tetrahedron structure of the
molecules may have allowed for necessary judgments of
depth to be made via monocular depth cues such as
occlusion, motion, linear perspective, and shadowing. It is
possible that the depth perception demands of the task could
be supported by monocular cues alone. Despite the growing
excitement surrounding 3D stereoscopic displays,
performance on certain tasks and applications may not
benefit from providing the latest display technology. Future
research is needed to elucidate the specific task qualities and
learning situations under which providing stereo actually
benefits the user.
Results from the NASA-TLX measure of participants’
subjective experience were consistent with the performance
data, and further demonstrated the importance of providing
colocated visual and haptic workspaces and the null effect
of viewing the display in stereo. Participants with the
colocated interface reported the task to be significantly less
physically demanding, less frustrating, and rated their
perceived performance higher than participants who used
the displaced interface. Participants were more comfortable
and confident when the interface was colocated; this
provides further evidence that although the performance
effects were small, they were meaningful in that they were
associated with the perceived task demands of the users.
Stereo did not affect ratings of subjective experience, further
demonstrating its unimportance for this task.
Males performed the task more accurately than females.
An interesting result is that females performed trials about
10 seconds faster when provided with colocation. This result
suggests that females have a more difficult time dealing
with visual and haptic mismatches, which might be
attributed to differences in spatial ability, experience with
computers, or both.

Discussion
The main purpose of this study was to examine the
importance of providing stereoscopic 3D viewing and
colocation of the haptic interface and virtual image during a
virtual object orientation task using molecular models. The
results demonstrate that providing colocation had a small
but significant impact on accuracy. The experiment failed to
demonstrate an effect of stereo on accuracy. The results
failed to show an effect of colocation or stereo on task
completion speed. Overall, these findings suggest that
colocation of haptic and visual information enabled
perceptual mediation of the task to some degree, whereas
stereo did not significantly increase perceptual mediation or
decrease cognitive load for this particular task.
Our results can be compared with previous studies
investigating the effect of colocation on virtual object
rotation. Ware and Rose (1999) found that colocation led to
35% faster performance during an object rotation task,
however no effect on accuracy was found. In a later study,
Ware and Arsenault (2006) found that colocation led to
faster response times, however they did not have a measure
of accuracy because trials were automatically terminated
when the manipulated object was within 5º of the target
orientation. Other studies investigating effects of colocation
are difficult to compare with the present study; the majority
of tasks used involve object translation rather than pure
object rotation, as in our task.
The findings of the present study demonstrate an accuracy
advantage, rather than the speed advantages demonstrated in
the previous studies. In regard to the Ware and Rose (1999)
result, it is important to note the authors’ task involved
repeatedly rotating a single simple shape and did not require
any local manipulation of the object, as in our task. It is
possible that when task demands are greater, providing
colocation benefits accuracy more than response time. In
regard to Ware and Arsenault (2006), the accuracy
advantage from colocation found in the present study would
translate into a response time benefit had the trials required
a minimum angular error for completion; thus it is likely
that the findings are complementary. Despite the relatively
small effect on accuracy, this study adds to the body of
literature demonstrating a performance benefit from
colocating visual and haptic workspaces for virtual object
rotation tasks. Further, this study shows that when rotating
different complex structures to match a given orientation,
providing colocation of haptic and visual information may
benefit precision more than speed.

This study demonstrated that providing colocated haptic
and visual workspaces had a small beneficial impact on
accuracy during a virtual object orientation matching task,
while providing stereo had no significant effect on accuracy.
Further, neither factor affected overall response time. It will
be important to examine whether results found on
representation matching performance generalize to
meaningful learning of the spatial structures. Future studies
will investigate how specific interface design features relate
to students’ ability to understand concepts regarding 3D
molecular structure and whether this learning can be
maintained and utilized during novel situations in which
models are no longer available. In addition to providing
basic information regarding the perceptual cues that
facilitate virtual object manipulation, this research will
inform the design of virtual models for science learning.
