interpersonal coordination.

rowing may afford interacting agents to synchronize their
individual behaviours to reach high levels of joint
performance, other types of joint activity – like playing a
game of baseball – rather afford complementary actions: i.e.
tightly coupled, reciprocal activity derived from different
behaviours performed across an extended temporal
sequence. Shared construction tasks as well as task-oriented
dialogues, for instance, have been shown to require smooth
turn-taking, and the development of interactional routines
which might involve complementary roles (Dale, Fusaroli,
Duran, & Richardson, in press; Fusaroli, RaczaszekLeonardi, & Tylén, accepted). Cultural practices dwell upon
and stabilize complementary distribution of work, to make
challenging task as the sailing of a warship or the
construction of huge buildings possible (Hutchins, 1995;
Perry, 2010).
The session will address the implications and respective
roles of synchrony, complementarity and asynchrony as
components of coordination. Different methods and
perspectives for quantifying and assessing coordinative
dynamics in language, behaviour and physiology will be
presented conceptually and in their empirical application.

Summary of Topic
Recent advances in social cognition and joint action reveal
the social and the mutual, rather than the individual and the
dichotomous aspects of cognition (Hasson, Ghazanfar,
Galantucci, Garrod, & Keysers, 2012). A widespread and
powerful model of socially interactive behavior is
‘synchrony’ (Jirsa & Kelso, 2004): Numerous studies have
thus recently indicated how individuals through social
interaction become increasingly entrained on multiple levels
from physiology to syntax: through interaction people
synchronize their heart rates, their subtle postural sways,
their gestures and gaze behaviors, align their lexicon and
their syntax (Fusaroli & Tylén, 2012; Louwerse, Dale, Bard,
& Jeuniaux, 2012; Pickering & Garrod, 2004). However,
emerging scholarship is increasingly attending to many
instances in which patterns of complementary and
asynchronous actions rather than synchronous ones seem to
predict high levels of interpersonal coordination and joint
performance. While some activities such as expertly timed

Rick Dale (moderator) is a cognitive scientist at UC
Merced. He has worked and published extensively on
language and social interaction developing and applying a
range of novel non-linear statistical methods to assess
dynamical properties of multimodal social coordination
(Dale, et al., in press; Dale & Spivey, 2006; Louwerse, et
al., 2012; Tollefsen & Dale, 2012).
Patrick Healey is a professor of human interaction and
head of the Interaction Media and Communication research
group at University of London. His research concerns
experimental work on technology-mediated dialogical
communication and – in particular – miscommunication
(Healey, Howes, & Purver, 2010; Healey & Mills, 2006;
Mills & Healey, 2008).
John J. McGraw, cognitive anthropologist (TESIS, a
Marie Curie Initial Training Network), and Panagiotis
Mitkidis, cognitive psychologist (Interacting Minds Centre
at Aarhus University and Center for Advanced Hindsight at
Duke University) investigate the role of objects and material
structures in the coordination of behavior, cognition, and the
enhancement of cooperation (Xygalatas et al., accepted).
Dorthe Døjbak Håkonsson is an associate professor at the
Aarhus School of Business. As an organization scientist, her
research focuses on how team shared emotions influence
organizational decision-making (Håkonsson, Burton, Obel,
& Laurdisen, 2012). Dan Mønster is a physicist and
assistant professor in the Department of Economics and
Business at Aarhus University. His current research interest
is investigating interactions among team members and the
effects of these interactions on team decisions and team
performance.
Kristian Tylén and Riccardo Fusaroli are both post
doctoral fellows at the Center for Semiotics and the
Interacting Minds Center, Aarhus University, with a
background in semiotics and cognitive science. They have
published on experimental and dynamical systems
approaches to social coordination – in particular taskoriented dialogue (Fusaroli et al., 2012; Fusaroli, et al.,
accepted; Fusaroli & Tylén, 2012).
