Abstract
By 8 months of age, infants use statistical regularities and
perceptual cues to orient attention (e.g. Kirkham et al., 2007;
Wu & Kirkham, 2010). However, it is unclear whether infants
are sensitive to the reliability of individual attentional cues. In
this eye-tracking study, 8-month-olds were familiarized with
a reliable face, which always looked to a box where an
animation appeared, and an unreliable face, which looked
only 25% of the time to the box containing the animation. At
test, when the animations did not appear, infants searched
longer in the corner cued by the reliable face, but did not
search longer in the corner cued by the unreliable face. These
results suggest that even young infants can track the the
reliability of potential informants and use this information to
distribute attention in support of early learning.

Introduction
For young infants, the natural world is a constant stream of
dynamic, multi-modal sensory experiences. In a short time,
they are able to parse this sensory overload into discrete and
recognizable objects, faces, and events. Selective attention
plays a critical role in this early learning, as infants must
focus on items that contain useful information while
ignoring random variation and meaningless noise. A number
of studies have demonstrated that infants can allocate
attention selectively in support of task-relevant learning
(Mareschal & Johnson, 2003; Richardson & Kirkham, 2004;
Tummeltshammer & Kirkham, in press; Wu & Kirkham,
2010). However, the selection process by which they are
able to filter relevant information from noise is less well
understood.
Given that the natural world contains a high degree of
statistical redundancy, showing considerable consistency
across space and time (Field, 1994), and there is evidence
that the developing response properties of some visual
neurons exploit the statistical nature of the input (Olshausen
& Field, 1996), it would be advantageous for the system to
selectively attend to statistically reliable and coherent
events. Research with young infants robustly shows that
they are sophisticated statistical learners, tracking

probabilistic events across multiple instances and updating
their representations of the world based on incoming data
(Fiser & Aslin, 2002; Kirkham et al., 2002; Kirkham et al.,
2007; Saffran, Aslin & Newport, 1996; Smith & Yu, 2008;
Wu, Gopnik, Richardson, & Kirkham, 2011).
Recent studies have demonstrated that infants distribute
attention selectively based on statistical information (Kidd,
Piantadosi, & Aslin, 2012; Tummeltshammer & Kirkham,
in press), which may guide early learning of events and
features that are reliably linked. For example, new evidence
from Kirkham and colleagues (2012) shows that young
infants prefer to look at objects with correlated rather than
uncorrelated parts and are surprised when statistically
coherent parts split apart (Wu, et al., 2011). Infants also
deploy attention with the influence of external cues,
including bottom-up perceptual salience and even abstract
cue-target associations (Cohen, 1972; Colombo, 2001;
Johnson, Posner, & Rothbart, 1991; 1994; McMurray &
Aslin, 2004). If these cues contain reliable information, then
they may guide the infant toward learnable content;
however, a mismatch between external cues and statistical
coherence may drive infants to distraction and prevent them
from encoding the critical stimulus events. A few studies
have shown that young infants will use central cues to orient
attention to peripheral locations when individual cues and
targets are perfectly correlated (Johnson, Posner & Rothbart,
1991; McMurray & Aslin, 2004). At present, however, there
is little evidence to address whether infants use statistical
information to evaluate the reliability of salient attentional
cues.
Faces offer a good opportunity to test whether attention to
salient cues is mediated by statistical reliability. From birth,
infants are drawn to faces, particularly those expressing eye
contact (Senju & Johnson, 2009), and very young infants
will orient faster to visible targets in the direction of an
adult’s gaze (Farroni, Massaccesi, Pividori, & Johnson,
2004; Hood, Willen, & Driver, 1998). Infants follow faces
from 4 months of age, and are sensitive to the relationship
between an adult’s gaze and the locations of objects
(D’Entremont, 2003; Senju, Csibra, & Johnson, 2008).
Indeed, there is recent evidence that infants learn better

1420

from faces than other attention-directing cues (e.g., flashing
lights; Wu & Kirkham, 2010). It is unclear whether infants
follow faces as a category of salient attentional cues or
perhaps have a general expectation that faces will provide
information. It remains an empirical question whether
infants track the statistical coherence of associations
between cues and their targets, and further, whether they can
update their expectations of individual face cues to guide
attention optimally.
Research on ‘selective trust’/‘source monitoring’ with
young children has demonstrated that they take an
informant’s knowledge into account when soliciting or
accepting new information. Preschoolers prefer to engage
with informants who are knowledgeable rather than ignorant
(Koenig & Harris, 2005), and will extend labels to novel
objects when they were provided by a reliable rather than an
unreliable adult (Clement, Koenig, & Harris, 2004; Koenig,
Clement, & Harris, 2004). This work has recently been
extended down to older infants: In a recent study, Begus and
Southgate (2012) found that 16-month-olds point more to
solicit information from adults who had previously labeled
objects correctly than from those who had mislabeled
objects. In addition, across two studies, Poulin-Dubois and
colleagues found that 14-month-olds were sensitive to an
adult’s reliability in a search task, and were more likely to
follow a reliable adult’s gaze behind an occluder (Chow,
Poulin-Dubois, & Lewis, 2008) and to imitate a reliable
adult’s actions (Poulin-Dubois, Brooker, & Polonia, 2011).
These studies suggest that infants as young as 14 months
can make an association between an informant’s actions and
the true state of the world and use it to guide their own
responses.
There are, however, some reasons to suspect that young
infants may have difficulty tracking the reliability of face
cues and allocating attention accordingly. First, while young
children may be sensitive to the reliability of an informant,
young infants may not attend to the relationship between a
salient cue and its target outcome. This could be due to a
general bias to follow faces, or the inability to
simultaneously attend to the face cue and keep track of its
reliability over trials. Second, young infants may have
difficulty making within-category distinctions; even if they
could successfully track the reliability of a category of
attentional cues (e.g. ‘Faces offer reliable information’),
infants may fail to make separate inferences for individual
instances of the same category (e.g. ‘Face A is reliable, but
Face B is not’). Third, young infants may form initial
associations between cues and targets that are difficult to
update in light of noisy data. In all of the studies described
with young children, the unreliable or ignorant adults
always provided false or incongruent information, so
children may have simply represented those adults as
‘wrong’ or ‘unsuccessful’ without having to update their
inferences.
The present eye-tracking study aimed to investigate
whether 8-month-old infants are sensitive to the statistical

reliability of attentional cues. Infants were familiarized with
four audio-visual animations of animals that appeared
within four boxes in each corner of the screen. On separate
trials, the locations of the animals were cued by either a
reliable or an unreliable face. The reliable face always
looked in the box where an animal would then appear, while
the unreliable face looked in the box containing an animal
only 25% of the time (and rather, looked in an empty box
75% of the time). Following familiarization, infants viewed
test trials in which the faces looked in the previously-cued
boxes and the animal sounds played, but the animations did
not appear. If infants had learned to expect an animation in
the cued box, then we hypothesized that they should search
longer in the cued box than in the uncued boxes. In addition,
infants viewed generalization trials in which the faces
looked to boxes that were never cued before and novel
animal sounds played, but again no animations appeared. If
8-month-old infants were able to track the reliability of the
individual faces across trials, then we hypothesized that they
should follow the reliable face to a new box, but abstain
from following the unreliable face.

Methods
Participants
Twenty-four 8-month-old infants (11 females, M = 8
months 13.4 days, range: 7m12d – 9m7d) participated in the
experiment, with an additional four infants tested but not
included due to fussiness, inattention and/or failure to
calibrate. Infants were recruited on a voluntary basis via
local advertisements. Informed consent was received from
all caregivers, and babies received a small gift.

Apparatus and Stimuli
Infants were eye-tracked using a Tobii TX300 eye-tracker
(www.tobii.com) with a 23” built-in monitor. Stimuli were
presented using Tobii Studio presentation software, and
sounds were played through stereo external speakers.
Throughout testing, infants were monitored via a built-in
video camera and their eye movements through the Tobii
Studio Live Viewer display. Two female actors were filmed
in controlled settings and their footage was edited into face
cue stimuli in Final Cut Express HD3 (Apple Inc., CA). The
animated clips were created using Macromedia Director MX
2004 and combined with the face cues in Final Cut Express.
Infants saw a full-screen display (1920 X1080 pixels)
comprised of four white boxes in the four corners of a black
screen. Within each box, an animated animal appeared: a
barking dog in Box 1, a croaking frog in Box 2, a gurgling
fish in Box 3, and a chirping bird in Box 4. The animations
were preceded by centrally presented face cues. On each
trial, one of two female faces appeared in the center, smiled
at the infant and said “Wow, look!”. She then turned to one
of the boxes and froze. An animal sound played and after a
500 ms delay, the corresponding animal appeared in its box.
The animated animal moved within the box for 3.5 seconds,
while the face remained frozen, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Examples of four familiarization trials with a reliable face cue (left) and four familiarization trials with an
unreliable face cue (right). While the reliable face always looked to the correct box, where an animal would appear, the
unreliable face only looked to the correct box on one out of four trials.

Design and Procedure
All infants were tested individually in a quiet room, seated
on their caregiver’s lap approximately 60 cm away from the
monitor. A 5-point calibration sequence (the four corners
and center of the screen; for details, please refer to von
Hofsten, Dahlström, & Fredricksson, 2005) was used to
obtain a reliable signal. Infant needed to fixate each point
before the experimenter manually advanced the calibration
sequence; if fewer than four points were accurately
calibrated, the sequence was repeated.
Following successful calibration, infants were
familiarized with a reliable face and an unreliable face on
separate blocks (order counter-balanced across infants). The
reliable face always looked at the box in which an animal
animation would appear, reliably cueing two different boxes
on separate trials. The unreliable face also cued two
different boxes on separate trials, but only looked 25% of
the time at the box containing an animation; that is, for the
unreliable face, the animals often appeared in boxes that did
not correspond to where the face had looked. For example,
if the reliable face looked in Boxes 1 and 2 on four separate
trials, either the dog (Box 1) or the frog (Box 2) would
appear to match where the face had cued (see Figure 1A).
However, if unreliable face looked in Boxes 1 and 3 on four
separate trials, either the frog (Box 2) or the fish (Box 3)
would appear, so that the cue and animation only matched
on one of the four trials (see Figure 1B). Critically, one box
was only cued by the reliable face, a second box was cued
by both faces on separate trials, a third box was only cued
by the unreliable face, and the last box was never cued.
Following familiarization, infants viewed test trials and
generalization trials. On a test trial, the face looked to the
box it had previously cued (whether reliably or unreliably)
and the animal sound played; however, the animation did
not appear. Instead, all four white boxes flashed briefly (200
ms) to encourage infants to make a saccade. On a

generalization trial, the face looked to the box it had never
looked at before and a new animal sound played. Again, no
animation appeared, but all four white boxes flashed briefly
to encourage saccades.
Infants viewed four blocks of four familiarization trials,
with the reliable and unreliable faces on alternating blocks,
followed by the two test blocks. This sequence was then
repeated, for a total of 40 familiarization (20 reliable, 20
unreliable), 4 test, and 4 generalization trials1.

Data Analysis
Eye movements were recorded and filtered into discrete
fixations using a spatial filter of 30 pixels and a temporal
filter of 100 ms. On test and generalization trials, when all
four boxes flashed but no animations appeared, accumulated
looking times (i.e. the summed durations of all fixations) to
each of the four boxes were measured as a proportion of
total looking time.

Results
Familiarization Trials
There were no differences in infants’ attention to the faces
(i.e. proportion of total accumulated looking time spent on
the face) across familiarization trials, suggesting that infants
looked equally to the reliable face (M=0.609, SE=0.017) and
the unreliable face (M=0.621, SE=0.016), paired t(23)=1.02,
p=ns.

Infants also viewed preferential looking pre- and post-tests of
the two faces side by side; however, as no differences in looking to
the faces emerged, perhaps due to their novel ‘out of context’
presentation, this data is not reported.

Test Trials

at the new box than at any other box, p<0.024 (Bonferronicorrected). However, on unreliably cued trials, no effect of
Box was apparent, F(3,63)=0.40, p=0.754, indicating that
infants did not follow the cue to the new box, nor did they
look longer at any other single box. Finally, a planned
comparison across reliably and unreliably cued
generalization trials confirmed that infants followed the cue
to the new box more when it was a reliable face cue than an
unreliable face cue, t(21)=4.20, p<0.001.

Proportions of looking time to the four boxes during test
trials, displayed in Figure 2, were analyzed with a 2
(Reliability) x 4 (Box) repeated measures ANOVA2. Results
show a significant main effect of Box, F(3,66)=3.64,
p=0.017, !p2=0.142, as well as a significant Reliability x
Box interaction, F(3,66)=3.55, p=0.019, !p2=0.139. This
interaction was unpacked using separate univariate
ANOVAs for test trials with reliable and unreliable face
cues. On reliably cued trials, a significant main effect of
Box was apparent, F(3,66)=8.32, p<0.001, !p2=0.274, and
post-hoc comparisons indicated that infants looked longer at
the cued box than at any other box, p<0.040 (Bonferronicorrected). However, on unreliably cued trials, no effect of
Box emerged, F(3,66)=0.21, p =0.888, indicating that
infants did not look longer at the cued box, nor at any other
single box. Finally, a planned comparison across reliably
and unreliably cued test trials confirmed that infants looked
more to the cued box when it was cued by a reliable face
than by an unreliable face, t(22)=2.66, p=0.014.

Generalization Trials
Similarly, proportions of looking time to the four boxes
during generalization trials, shown in Figure 3, were
analyzed with a 2(Reliability) x 4(Box) repeated measures
ANOVA3. Results show a slight main effect of Box,
F(3,63)=2.70, p=0.053, !p2=0.114, as well as a significant
Reliability x Box interaction, F(3,63)=9.83, p<0.001,
!p2=0.319. This interaction was explored using separate
univariate ANOVAs for generalization trials with reliable
and unreliable face cues. On reliably cued trials, a
significant main effect of Box emerged, F(3,63)=12.39,
p<0.001, !p2=0.379, and post-hoc comparisons indicated
that infants followed the cue to the new box, looking longer

Previous research has demonstrated that young infants are
sensitive to statistical and perceptual cues and can use them
to allocate attention in their busy, multisensory world. The
present study suggests that infants can also integrate these
sources of information to infer the reliability of individual
cues and modify their responses. In the current study,
infants searched consistently in the box cued by the reliable
face, and even followed it to search in a box where no
animation had appeared before. At the same time, infants
did not follow the unreliable face, and rather searched at
chance among all four boxes. These differences in looking
behavior could not be accounted for by mere differences in
global attention, as infants looked equally long at both
reliable and unreliable face cues during familiarization
trials.
Cue reliability also appeared to have important
consequences for infants’ audio-visual learning. Infants
correctly predicted where a reliably cued animal would
appear, but did not learn to localize the animal that had been
unreliably cued. This study adds to a growing body of
research suggesting that appropriate cues can enhance
infants’ processing and learning of cued events (Reid,
Striano, Kaufman, & Johnson, 2004; Senju, Csibra, &
Johnson, 2008; Yoon, Johnson, & Csibra, 2008; Wu &
Kirkham, 2010). For example, Wu and Kirkham (2010)
found that 8-month-olds were better able to remember the
spatial locations of audio-visual targets preceded by social
cues compared to uncued targets. It is possible that infants’
sensitivity to reliable cues may act as a driving force for

1423

early learning, with cued attention helping the learner gather
information and integrate it over time (Smith, Colunga, &
Yoshida, 2010). Indeed, enhanced detection and processing
of cued stimulus events are well-documented in studies of
selective attention with adults and children (Goldberg,
Mauer, & Lewis, 2001; Mackintosh, 1975; Posner, 1980).
While the present results suggest that infants are sensitive
to the reliability of attentional cues, it remains unknown
whether this sensitivity is face-specific or would extend to
other types of cues. A few studies have shown that infants
struggle to direct attention with a non-social central cue
(Varga et al, 2009), though they seem to succeed in learning
the cue-target relationship when the cue is perceived as
social (Corkum & Moore, 1998; Deligianni, Senju, Gergely,
& Csibra 2011; Johnson, Slaughter, & Carey, 1998; Wu &
Kirkham, 2010). However, in these studies, cues have been
used to direct infants’ attention to one of multiple objects,
with the result that infants look equally to both cued and
uncued objects. Perhaps, then, infants need to learn the
function of an abstract, non-social cue with a singular target
(as in McMurray & Aslin, 2004) before it can be used to
disambiguate multiple targets. Future experiments will aim
to evaluate whether infants consider the statistical reliability
of attentional cues more broadly.
The mechanisms driving statistically cued attention are
also unclear and worth investigating in future research. A
modelling approach, using infants’ own trial-by-trial data as
input (cf. Piantadosi, Kidd, & Aslin, in press; Yurovsky,
Hidaka, & Wu, 2012), may help to characterize the multiple
processes involved in statistical learning of cued events,
such as selective attending to cues and targets, tracking the
correspondence between them, and deciding which cues to
follow. Further, it would be interesting to distinguish
whether infants’ selective attention to cued events is
motivated by the prospect of an exciting reward, or if there
may be something intrinsically motivating about the
predictive information itself. Bromberg-Martin and
Hikosaka (2009) found that macaque monkeys prefer to
have predictive cues rather than unpredictive cues, even
when the ensuing rewards were identical. In the present
study, infants received audio-visual animations on both
reliably cued and unreliably cued trials, but did not develop
a preference for the reliable (or unreliable) face. This may
be due, in part, to the salience of the faces, or perhaps
because infants were not trained to make a choice between
cues as the monkeys were in Bromberg-Martin and
Hikosaka (2009). Nevertheless, future research will aim to
explore interactions in cued attention between the reliability
of the cue and the salience of the reward.

Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that 8-month-olds can
distinguish reliable and unreliable faces and use this
inference to modify attention to cued targets. These results
extend the existing literature on ‘selective trust’/‘source
monitoring’ to young infants, suggesting that a sensitivity to
the reliability of potential informants may be present early

in development. Selective trust, like selective attention, is
influenced by statistical regularity, external cues, and the
extent to which these factors are weighted in a particular
context. This study has provided evidence that 8-month-old
infants can track the reliability of individual cues to deploy
attention optimally in support of early learning.
