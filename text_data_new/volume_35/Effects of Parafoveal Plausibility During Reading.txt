Abstract
There is controversy concerning the question of whether
meaning can be extracted from a parafoveal word during
reading and whether this might occur in an overlapping
fashion with the lexical processing of the currently-fixated
word. We suggest that previous attempts to investigate this
have been bedevilled by problems associated with the use of
priming methodology. Instead, we used an eye movement
contingent change technique and manipulated the plausibility
of the parafoveal preview, resulting in it being either valid, a
plausible alternative, anomalous, or an illegal letter string.
The results showed (a) a meaning-based parafoveal-on-foveal
effect, (b) preview benefits driven by both orthographic and
semantic influences, and (c) continuing disruption associated
with orthographically dissimilar previews. We suggest that
this pattern is most consistent with models of eye movement
control that allow for distributed attention during reading.
Keywords: Eye movements; preview benefit; plausibility;
parafoveal-on-foveal effects; boundary technique; reading.

Introduction
The nature of Preview Benefit (PB) – the advantage
accruing to the reader from an accurate parafoveal preview
of the following word – critically informs our understanding
of the reading process, indicating those features which are,
and are not, extracted from an as yet unfixated word. Using
the boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975), many studies have
shown that both orthographic and phonological features
appear to be extracted from parafoveal words (see Schotter,
Angele & Rayner, 2012, for a review); however, evidence
for a semantic PB remains controversial (see Radach &
Kennedy, 2013; Rayner, White, Kambe, Miller &
Liversedge, 2003).
While both serial (e.g., E-Z Reader; Reichle, Warren, &
McConnell, 2009) and parallel (e.g., SWIFT; Engbert,
Nuthmann, Richter & Kliegl, 2005) models of eye
movement control during reading provide accounts of
orthographic and phonological PB, only parallel models
appear capable of accounting for semantic PB. In serial
models, lexical processing is restricted to one word at a
time, with attention moving to the parafoveal word only
when the currently fixated word has been fully identified.
Serial models therefore typically only accommodate very
early stages of word recognition occurring on parafoveal
words before a saccade remarries fixation location with
attention. In contrast, in parallel models, all words within

the perceptual span can be processed simultaneously, up to
and including the level of semantic processing.
Studies investigating semantic PB have typically
manipulated the sematic relatedness of the preview and the
target word, on the basis that responses to semantically
related word pairs are facilitated compared to unrelated
pairs (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971). By extension, it is
suggested that semantically related previews should
facilitate target viewing compared to unrelated previews.
Using the boundary paradigm, Rayner Balota and Pollatsek
(1986) asked participants to read sentences such as “My
younger brother has brilliantly composed a new song for
the school play”, in which the pre-fixation preview of
“song” was either “song” (valid), “tune” (related), “door”
(unrelated), or “sorp” (a visually similar nonword). Only
once the eye passed an invisible boundary, located before
the critical word, did the target word “song” appear. Despite
showing that their critical words produced facilitation in a
classic priming experiment, Rayner et al found no evidence
for a semantic PB during reading. However, in this example
sentence, we see that the word to the left of the target
contains only three letters, and as short words are frequently
skipped (Rayner & McConkie, 1976), the prior fixation may
in fact have fallen two words to the left of the target,
seriously reducing the chance of it eliciting a semantic PB.
A more general problem with experiments investigating
semantic PB using associative previews is that while there
may be semantic facilitation, there is also a word change
that might be expected to give rise to some form of
inhibition. Semantically related word pairs, such as north–
south, rattle-bottle and arms–legs, (from Rayner et al, 1986),
have very different meanings, and this could exert an
inhibitory effect on on-going sentence interpretation. Rayner
et al (1986) attempted to test this possibility by asking
participants to rate their sentence pairs for similarity of
meaning and reanalysing the results from only the 20
sentence pairs rated as most similar in meaning. Since this
analysis again failed to show a semantic PB, they dismissed
this as an explanation for their null result. However, a
measure of overall sentence meaning does not necessarily
capture the extent to which a local change in word meaning
might have disrupted the reading process at the point at
which it occurred. We conclude, therefore, that interference
resulting from word change remains a possibility.

Altarriba, Kambe, Pollatsek and Rayner (2001) used a
variant of this technique with fluent English-Spanish
bilinguals. They employed semantically related previews
which were translations with virtually the same meaning as
the targets, thereby reducing the possibility of interference.
All changes involved a word preview from the other
language that was either: cognate (orthographically and
semantically similar), noncognate (semantically similar but
orthographically dissimilar), pseudocognate (semantically
unrelated but orthographically similar), or control (unrelated
orthographically and semantically). They found no evidence
for a semantic PB in the absence of orthographic similarity.
However, it remains possible that facilitation might not
cross over between the lexica of the two languages, and as
Hohenstein, Laubrock and Kliegl (2010) point out, since the
previews and targets were in different languages, switching
costs (Meuter & Allort, 1999) might mask any semantic PB.
Hohenstein et al (2010) suggest that the elusive nature of
semantic PB may result from a lack of control over the
preview duration of masked words. To test this possibility,
they used fast priming (Sereno & Rayner, 1992) and the
boundary paradigm in a novel way. Prior to landing on the
pretarget word, the target was masked with an illegal letter
string. Once the eye landed on the pre-target word, this
illegal nonword preview changed to either a semantically
related or unrelated prime for durations of 35ms, 80ms or
125ms, after which point, the target was displayed.
Hohenstein et al report a significant semantic PB only when
the prime duration was 125ms (Experiments 1 & 2). When
primes were presented in bold typeface, a significant effect
was observed with 80ms primes, although, the 125ms effect
was no longer significant (Experiment 3). Given the
transient nature of the effects and variability across
experiments, these results would benefit from replication.
An alternative way to explore when the meaning of a
word becomes available is to investigate plausibility effects.
For example, Murray and colleagues (Kennedy, Murray &
Boissiere, 2004; Murray, 2006; Murray, 1998; Murray &
Rowan, 1998) recorded eye movements in a series of
experiments where plausibility was manipulated.
Participants read a sentence and then pressed a button,
triggering another sentence to be displayed; the task being to
indicate whether the two sentences were the same or
different. These studies showed effects of the plausibility of
the combination of the initial noun phrase with the verb, for
example, “The hunters stacked….” vs “The bishops
stacked…”, and in a number of the studies, this was
reflected not only in fixations falling on the verb, but also in
some eye movement measures before the verb was directly
fixated, suggesting the extraction of meaning from words in
the parafovea. However, Rayner et al (2003) report being
unable to replicate one of Murray et al’s findings in a
reading study and suggest that their results may have been
task specific.
Starr and Inhoff (2004; Experiment 1) also investigated
the consequences of providing a contextually inappropriate
word to the right of fixation. They masked a critical word

with itself, a contextually inappropriate word, or a legal or
illegal nonword. In addition to finding clear orthographic
parafoveal-on-foveal effects, a trend also emerged in which
a contextually inconsistent word in the parafovea reduced
gaze duration by 22ms on the pre-target word compared to
an accurate preview. However, a subsequent analysis
excluding the 45% of cases where fixations fell near the
ends of the pre-target words (possibly as a result of
oculomotor error) showed no reliable effect. The
contextually inconsistent preview also gave rise to inflated
fixation times when the target was fixated, but this effect
could be attributed to a lack of orthographic overlap, rather
than any extraction of parafoveal meaning.
While plausibility related parafoveal-on-foveal effects
remain controversial, it is widely accepted that the
plausibility of words within a sentence can have an
immediate impact on fixation durations falling on the word.
For example, Rayner, Warren, Juhasz and Liversedge
(2004) presented participants with a series of sentences in
which a critical noun was either plausible (likely),
implausible (unlikely) or anomalous (inappropriate), given
the preceding sentence context. They found that anomalous
words had an immediate impact on gaze duration, while
effects of implausibility were reflected only in later
measures. Interestingly, they also discovered a plausibilityrelated parafoveal-on-foveal effect, with gaze duration on
the word preceding the anomalous one being 17ms and
14ms longer than in the control and implausible conditions,
respectively. The authors, however, attribute this effect to
oculomotor error.
Whether or not one questions the interpretation of
apparent semantic parafoveal-on-foveal effects, it is clear
that manipulating the plausibility of a word can produce
robust effects on the reading pattern when that word is
fixated. This study capitalised on that finding and presented
participants with sentences in which a critical word (n+1)
was masked prior to receiving a direct fixation by either a
(a) valid (identical), (b) plausible but different, or, (c)
anomalous word, or (d) an illegal nonword. Once the eye
passed an invisible boundary located before wordn+1, all
previews were replaced with the valid preview. If meaning
is extracted from the parafovea, it would be expected that an
anomalous preview should exert an immediate impact on
wordn+1 fixations compared to the plausible preview
condition. Conversely, if the meaning of the parafoveal
word is not extracted while fixating wordn, then plausible
and anomalous previews should both produce the same cost,
as a result of their lack of orthographic overlap with the
target. The illegal nonword served as a baseline against
which the magnitude of PB could be judged.

Materials and Design
Ninety-six experimental sentences were constructed. As can
be seen in the example below, each contained a critical word
pair, comprising a 6 letter verb (wordn) followed by a 6 or 7
letter noun (wordn+1). To facilitate processing, wordn was
always high frequency (mean 135 occurrences per million,
by Kucera & Francis, 1967). Wordn+1 was assigned one of
four pre-fixation previews, all chosen to be very low in
predictability: valid (e.g. “dinner” - identical), plausible
(e.g., “coffee” – an alternative that fitted the preceding
context), anomalous (e.g. “caught” - a word that produced a
semantic or grammatical violation), or an illegal nonword
(e.g., “fumeio” – a letter string containing combinations not
found in the English dictionary, in this case “eio”). The
frequency of these three preview words did not differ
(means 132, 144 and 140 per million respectively, all ts<1).
Previews were displayed until the eye passed an invisible
boundary located prior to the space before word n+1, shown
below with a “|”. When the eye crossed this boundary, the
target word was then displayed.

two children and her husband.
Plausibility ratings were provided by 12 participants, who
did not take part in the eye tracking experiment. Participants
rated all three versions of each sentence up to and including
wordn+1 (illegal letter strings were not included). They used
a rating scale from 1 (low) to 7 (high) plausibility.
Additionally, they could use “U” instead of providing a
numerical rating if they felt the sentences were
ungrammatical; “U” scores were coded as 0 for purposes of
analysis. The valid and plausible fragments were both rated
as highly plausible (means = 6.3 and 6.2, respectively), with
no significant difference between these conditions
(t(95)=.85, p=.40). The mean rating for the anomalous
condition was 1.0 which differed significantly from both the
valid (t(95)=44.63, p<.001), and plausible conditions
(t(95)=45.90, p<.001).
Four counterbalanced item lists were created, each
containing the 96 experimental sentences together with 19
filler and 8 practice items and 20 comprehension questions.
Wordn+1 previews initially masked the target, with each item
list containing an equal number of valid, plausible,
anomalous and illegal nonword previews. Each participant
was presented with the items in a different randomised
order.

Apparatus
A dental composition bite bar and chin rest were used to
minimise head movements. Sentences were displayed on a
VDU screen in white monopitch font on a black
background. At a viewing distance of 50cm, each character
subtended approximately 0.3 degrees of a visual angle.
Reading was binocular, but only eye movements from the
right eye were recorded using a “Dr. Bouis” infrared pupil-

centered computation device sampled with a 12-bit A-D at
2ms intervals. The apparatus was calibrated after every
fourth sentence. In order to answer questions, right-hand
(“yes”) and left-hand (“no”) button boxes were provided.

Procedure
Verbal and written instructions were provided. Calibration
consisted of looking at a series of horizontally aligned
numbers. Once optically set up and calibrated, participants
fixated a cross, which after receiving a 100ms stable
fixation, triggered display of a sentence. Participants were
asked to read for comprehension, but not to adjust their
usual reading style. If presented with a question, they were
asked to respond using the button boxes.

Results and Discussion
Data were analysed treating both participants (F1) and items
(F2) as random variables. In all analyses item file was
treated as a between-groups dummy factor. Analysis
focused on the pretarget word (n), the target word (n+1) and
a spillover region comprising the following three words. A
number of eye movement measures are reported for each
region: the duration of the first and last fixations, gaze
duration (summed duration of all fixations until the eye
exits the region in either direction), go-past time (summed
duration of all fixations, including regressions until the
following region is first fixated) and first pass skipping
probability. Participants clearly read carefully, with 86%
overall accuracy on the comprehension questions.
Effects of Wordn+1 Preview on Wordn
The probability of fixating wordn did not vary across
conditions (both Fs<1) and first fixation duration, gaze and
go-past time showed no reliable effect of preview type (all
Fs<1.3). A trend did however emerge in last fixation
duration (F1 (3,72) = 2.81, p<.05; F2 (3,276) = 2.05, p=.11)
with shorter fixations when the preview was either an illegal
nonword or an anomalous word. While first and last fixation
durations constitute overlapping sets, the two measures
potentially tap into differing processes. It is not surprising,
therefore, to find a trend emerging statistically only for
those fixations which were the last to fall on the word. For
this measure, pairwise comparisons showed no significant
difference between the valid and plausible conditions (F1
(1,24) = 2.07, p=.16, F2 (1,92) = 2.21, p=.14), however,
when these two conditions were combined and compared to
the anomalous condition, durations were reliably shorter in
the anomalous condition (F1 (1,24) = 5.30, p<.05, F2 (1,92)
= 4.29, p<.05), suggesting that this preview attracted
attention from wordn. The same trend emerged when an
illegal nonword fell to the right of fixation, although the
difference between the combined valid and plausible
conditions and the illegal nonword preview was only
reliable over subjects (F1 (1,24) = 4.54, p<.05, F2 (1,92) =
1.10, p=.30). The pattern overall, however, suggests that
readers respond similarly to both orthographic illegality and

3725

anomaly to the right of fixation. This speed-up seems
similar to the finding by Starr and Inhoff (2004) of a trend
towards shorter gaze durations on the pre-target word when
the target preview was contextually inconsistent.

Interestingly Rayner et al (2004) reported an effect of
parafoveal anomaly on wordn in the opposite direction, with
longer fixations when there was an anomalous word to the
right of fixation. They concluded this must result from
mislocated fixations, with the reader staying and processing
wordn+1 from a sub-optimal parafoveal location. But a
reduction in fixation duration does not permit the same
interpretation. These results and the pattern apparent in
Starr and Inhoff’s contextually inconsistent condition appear
more consistent with Kennedy’s (1998, 2000) attractor
hypothesis, in which something unexpected in the periphery
attracts attention, resulting in shorter fixation durations on
the preceding word. Parafoveal-on-foveal effects have
frequently been reported as a consequence of orthographic
peculiarities to the right of fixation; however, here we see it,
to an equivalent extent, as a consequence of meaning.
Wordn+1 Preview Effects on Wordn+1
There was no reliable effect of preview on the skipping of
wordn+1 (F1 (3,72) = 1.50, p=.22; F2 (3,276) = 1.70, p=.16).
There was, however, a consistent effect of prior preview in
all durational measures: first (F1 (3,72) = 7.43, p<.001; F2
(3,276) = 5.81, p<.01), and last fixation durations (F1 (3,72)
= 4.69, p<.01; F2 (3,276) = 3.5, p<.05), gaze duration (F1
(3,72) = 8.87, p<.001; F2 (3,276) = 8.71, p<.001), and gopast time (F1 (3,72) = 7.65, p<.001; F2 (3,276) = 9.29,
p<.001). As can be seen from Table 2, the longest durations
were associated with words previously masked by an illegal
nonword, followed by anomalous then plausible previews,
with valid previews associated with the shortest durations.

Pairwise comparisons revealed that a preview of an illegal
nonword increased fixation durations across all measures:
first (F1 (1,24) = 47.02, p<.001; F2 (1,92) = 18.06, p<.001);

and last fixation durations (F1 (1,24) = 21.87, p<.001; F2
(1,92) = 14.97, p<.001); gaze duration (F1 (1,24) = 23.00,
p<.001; F2 (1,92) = 23.68, p<.001) and go-past time (F1
(1,24) = 15.69, p<.001; F2 (1,92) = 26.67, p<.001).
Readers also appear to have noticed the change from the
plausible preview to the valid target, reflected in a reliable
increase in first fixation duration (F1 (1,24) = 5.66, p<.05;
F2 (1,92) = 5.00, p<.05). However, the similar trends in last
fixation duration and go-past time failed to achieve
statistical significance (F1 (1,24) = 3.22, p=.08; F2 (1,92) =
2.62, p=.11 and F1 (1,24) = 3.70, p=.06; F2 (1,92) = 1.73,
p=.19, respectively) and there was no effect in gaze duration
(both Fs<1). Overall, this pattern suggests that the change
from a different, though plausible, word was noticed
immediately and resulted in an increased probability of
regressing, as reflected in go-past time, but not in gaze
duration, since this is terminated by the regressive
movement. It is not clear, however, whether this is an effect
of meaning change, since it could equally be a consequence
of the lack of orthographic overlap between the plausible
preview and target.
A test of the effect of meaning can, however, be found in
the contrast between plausible and anomalous previews,
since both involve a change in orthography. The results
here suggest that the meaning of wordn+1 was indeed
extracted while fixating wordn. While both first and last
fixation duration showed no evidence of an increased cost of
anomaly (all Fs<1), the 14ms increase in gaze duration was
significant by-subjects and approached significance byitems (F1 (1,24) = 4.78, p<.05; F2 (1,92) = 2.99, p=.08) and
with regressions taken into account, the 25ms increase in
go-past time was significant by-subjects and very close to
significant by-items (F1 (1,24) = 5.88, p<.05; F2 (1,92) =
3.51, p=.06).
As can be seen in Table 3, an increase in go-past time
following anomalous previews also arose in the spillover
region (see below). Combining wordn+1 and the spillover
regions, the difference in go-past between the plausible
(898ms) and anomalous (946ms) conditions was significant
by both subjects and items (F1 (1,24) = 7.29, p<.05; F2
(1,92) = 6.17, p<.05). This effect – an immediate and robust
slowing in the anomalous condition - is in the expected
direction based on, for example, the findings of Rayner et al
(2004), who suggest that anomalous words “hit the reader
over the head” (p. 1297). It seems from these results
however, that the genesis of this effect can be parafoveal,
with the reader detecting anomaly far earlier than previously
thought.
It could be suggested that these results stem from wordn
receiving full lexical access, allowing an attention shift to
wordn+1 which also received full lexical access and semantic
interpretation, all prior to wordn+1 being fixated. While
possible, this seems extremely unlikely with both the low
predictability and length of wordn+1 conspiring against such
rapid parafoveal identification.
These results strongly suggest that parafoveal preview
effects are not restricted to the extraction of orthographic

3726

General Discussion

and phonological features, but rather, that higher level
linguistic processing can be engaged when previewing
words to the right of fixation, and when the input changes,
as happened here, this interferes with later comprehension.
Wordn+1 Preview Effects in the Spillover Region:
As shown in Table 3, the spillover region was rarely
skipped, with little difference between the preview
conditions (both Fs<1). Both first and last fixation durations
were unaffected by wordn+1 preview type (all Fs<1), as was
gaze duration (F1 (3,72) = 1.56, p=.21; F2 (3,276) = 1.62,
p=.18). There was, however, a highly significant effect of
wordn+1 preview on go-past time (F1 (3,72) = 6.98, p<.001;
F2 (3,276) = 10.48, p<.001), with higher durations when
wordn+1 had been changed.

Pairwise comparisons show go-past time significantly
higher following an illegal nonword compared to a valid
preview (F1 (1,24) = 7.65, p<.05; F2 (1,92) = 5.99, p<.05).
This finding is difficult to reconcile with models such as EZ Reader in which orthographic extraction occurs during the
first stage of lexical processing on a word (L1). L1 can
commence on wordn+1 if the word is parafoveally available
while fixating wordn. However, if preview is denied, L1 is
delayed until wordn+1 is fixated, resulting in the standard
wordn+1 PB. But as soon as L1 is complete, a saccade is
programmed to wordn+2, at which point the second stage of
lexical processing (L2) commences. Since it is postulated
that this stage follows orthographic extraction, the time for
attention to shift to wordn+2 should only ever be a function of
later linguistic processing and not delayed by difficulties
with orthographic extraction. According to the E-Z Reader
model, therefore, it should never be the case that fixation
durations are inflated after wordn+1 has been passed – unless
of course they are ‘mislocated’, but in that case the response
should be to stay and process, rather than to regress, as seen
here.
While the 48ms increase following a plausible compared
to a valid preview was significant (F1 (1,24) = 20.68,
p<.001; F2 (1,92) = 17.53, p<.001, the 23ms increase
following an anomalous compared to a plausible preview
was not (F1 (1,24) = 1.70, p=.21; F2 (1,92) = 2.47, p=.12).
Somewhat surprisingly, spillover effects relating to a lack of
orthographic overlap between preview and target appear to
show a longer time course than effects of parafoveal
meaning, with the latter exerting a more immediate impact,
mostly reflected in the cumulative duration measures on
wordn+1.

This study set out to investigate whether PB is restricted to
the orthographic and phonological properties of a parafoveal
word or whether meaning can also be extracted before a
word is directly fixated. Prior research has failed to show
much evidence for a semantic PB, but we suggest this may
be due to the use of semantically related previews, with the
word change interfering with target processing, rather than
facilitating the recognition process. By varying the
plausibility of previews, we have found two important
semantic effects.
First, we found evidence that an anomaly in the parafovea
can attract attention, resulting in shorter fixation durations
on pre-target words. While others have reported anomalyrelated parafoveal-on-foveal effects (Kennedy, Murray &
Boissiere, 2004; Murray, 1998; Murray & Rowan, 1998;
Rayner et al, 2004; Starr & Inhoff, 2004), this appears to be
the first study to find a reliable effect that cannot be
attributed to a potentially mislocated fixation. As
Liversedge, Paterson and Pickering (1998) point out, when
faced with difficulty the reader has three options: (a) stay
and resolve the problem, (b) make a regression, or (c)
proceed, in anticipation that later words will help resolve the
difficulty. It seems that here readers have had a tendency to
opt for the latter option, which as Liversedge et al point out,
can result in reduced fixation durations.
Second, wordn+1 PB was influenced by the plausibility of
the preview. This effect cannot be explained in terms of
orthographic overlap since both the plausible and anomalous
word previews differed from the target. The nature of the
effect was distinctly different depending on whether a
plausible or anomalous preview was employed; with
anomalous previews exerting a more immediate and robust
effect on wordn+1 viewing times. Since these previews were
only available prior to wordn+1 receiving a direct fixation,
the results clearly provide evidence for the extraction of
meaning from a word in the parafovea.
A proponent of serial word processing might attempt to
explain these findings with the suggestion that the meaning
effects arose when attention moved to wordn+1 following
foveal identification of wordn, but before the eye movement
was executed. However, this would necessitate that there is
enough of a lag between the shift of attention and the eye
movement not only to enable the L1 stage of processing of
wordn+1 to be completed, resulting in a potential skip, but
that there was enough time for L2 also to be completed,
allowing meaning extraction to occur. However, word n+1
was skipped rarely and no more often when it had been
anomalous, and in any case, it seems rather unlikely that all
this processing could somehow be shoehorned into the time
between the termination of lexical processing of word n and
the execution of the saccade out of it.
Given the form of the wordn+1 effects found here, it seems
that the approach of looking for meaning effects using
semantic associates is likely flawed. Even if there is some
semantic facilitation from the associated word preview, the
magnitude of this would appear to be more than outweighed

by the interference generated by a word change. This sort
of combination of facilitation and inhibition might possibly
explain why Hohenstein et al (2010) only found a semantic
PB with a fast prime duration of 125ms on the pre-target
word (unless the prime’s saliency was enhanced). Shorter
prime durations might not allow time for semantic
processing to occur, while longer durations might strengthen
the interference.
A final important finding relates to the continued effect of
masking wordn+1 with an orthographically dissimilar
preview, shown in longer fixation durations in the spillover
region. While serial models can account for shorter fixation
durations in the spillover region - since longer fixation
durations on wordn+1 following an invalid preview would
allow more wordn+2 preview to accrue – the finding of a
continuing increase in fixation duration cannot be afforded
the same interpretation.
Overall, the results of this study are difficult to reconcile
with models of eye movement control that allow only
strictly serial sequential lexical processing. Rather, they
seem more compatible with a perspective in which multiple
words may be lexically processed in an overlapping fashion.
