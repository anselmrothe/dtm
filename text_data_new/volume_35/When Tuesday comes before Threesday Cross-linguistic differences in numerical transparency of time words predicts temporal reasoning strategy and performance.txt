relevantly, acquisition studies (Miura et al., 1993, 1994;
Miller et al., 1995; Paik & Mix, 2003) have found that
preschool-aged children whose native languages employ
more systematic naming systems for their numbers
outperform their counterparts who speak languages that use
less transparent number naming systems, on both number
matching and number identification tasks. When asked to
demonstrate numbers using combinations of individual unit
cubes representing the quantity one and long blocks
representing ten, Asian children whose languages use
numerical names that are congruent with base 10
numeration systems (Fuson, 1990) were much more likely
to use the blocks of ten in constructing multi-digit numbers
than their counterparts, whose native naming systems were
not similarly transparent. This led the authors of that study
to argue that ―numerical language characteristics may have
a significant effect on cognitive representation of numbers‖
(Miura et al., 1994, p. 410), which in turn may enhance the
performance of Asian-language-speaking children on tasks
involving the concept of place value.
The types of names given to various symbolic systems,
such as numbers, have also been shown to affect the
problem solving abilities of competent symbol users. Seron
and Fayol (1994) noticed that the number naming system in
French-speaking Belgium is simpler than the one used in
France (in Belgium, 98 is roughly "ninety-eight" but in
France, it's "four-twenty-eighteen"). They reported that
second-graders in France made more errors in number
production than their Belgian counterparts. The effects of
naming system also extend into adulthood and mathematical
performance. For instance, adult English speakers have
more difficulty reversing two-digit numbers ending in 1
(e.g., saying ―14‖ when shown ―41‖) than Chinese speakers
do, presumably a result of English‘s idiosyncratic rules for
naming numbers between 11 and 19 (Miller & Zhu, 1991).
In sum, differences in number naming systems affect the
acquisition and use of number concepts. The current study
investigated whether the same is true for the naming of time
concepts (in this case, DOW and MOY). In particular, we
asked whether the mathematically transparent naming of
time concepts confers advantages on acquisition of time
concepts and reasoning about time. There has been limited
work on this question. Kelly et al. (1999) is the only
systematic experimental investigation. They asked college

Abstract
Time concepts are named differently across the world's
languages. In English, the names for days of the week and
months of the year are opaque—to people learning and using
English, there's no obvious reason why Friday or September
have the names they do. But in other languages, like Chinese,
time concepts have numerically transparent names—the days
of the week and months of the year are named using
sequential numbers. We investigated whether having opaque
versus mathematically transparent time concepts affects how
people reason about time. Results show that Chinese speakers
are more likely to spontaneously employ arithmetic when
doing temporal calculations, which in turn improves the speed
and accuracy of some time calculations. English speakers
appear to use other strategies, such as sequential recitation.
Keywords: time concepts; temporal reasoning, mathematical
ability; linguistic relativity.

Introduction
The world‘s languages encode time terms in different ways.
In English, names of days of the week (DOW) or months of
the year (MOY) are derived from planetary or mythical
terms (Zerubavel, 1985), and as a result are largely opaque
to contemporary users of the language—why for instance do
Wednesday or April have the names they have? By contrast,
many other languages exhibit more numerically transparent
naming systems. Chinese Mandarin is exemplary of this
pattern. It uses numbers in the names of months and days.
For DOW, this system begins with Monday as the first day
of the week. Thus, xingqi yi, ―weekday one‖, is Monday,
xingqi er, ―weekday two‖, is Tuesday, etc. The only
exception is Sunday, the last day of the week, xingqi ri,
which translates to ―weekday of sun‖. Similarly, months in
Chinese are numbered from one to 12, with ―month one‖
denoting January, ―month two‖ February, and so on.
Do differences in how languages name time concepts
cause differences in how speakers of those languages reason
about time? For instance, does the numerical transparency
of DOW and MOY terms affect the kinds of cognitive
mechanisms people use to make temporal calculations?
There has been little work on this issue. The most relevant
line of work has focused on cross-linguistic effects of
transparency of number systems themselves, showing that
differences in number naming systems can affect cognitive
development and non-linguistic performance. Most

students in China and the United States to name the day or
month that occurs a specified length of time before or after
another given day or month. Chinese college students
performed these calculations faster than American college
students. Kelly and colleagues argued that the difference
resulted from the use of different strategies as a
consequence of the naming systems used in Chinese and
English. However, this argument about the mechanisms
used was based on participants‘ self-reports. Moreover, the
calculation distance in Kelly et al.‘s (1999) experiment was
held constant—4 for the DOW task and 7 for the MOY task.
The use of the constant distance caused some participants to
predict the answers; one of the strategies participants
reported was memorizing specific pairs of items. The
experiment described below, in which distances vary,
indirectly assesses the mechanisms adults use to perform
temporal reasoning tasks, and whether these mechanisms
vary with native language.

A second prediction of the hypothesis that Chinese
speakers use arithmetic more than English speakers is that
the calculation of distances from Sunday (which is called
―weekday sun‖ in Chinese) should be more difficult for
Chinese speakers than from any other day in a week, since
number is not used in naming this day. This irregularity may
cause trouble in applying the arithmetic strategy, thus
slowing down Chinese speakers' calculations, compared to
calculation involving other days of the week. Again, by
contrast, English speakers should show no increased
difficulty when making calculations relative to Sunday.
A third prediction is that the Chinese speakers‘ speed of
calendar calculating should not vary much with longer
temporal distance if they primarily use an arithmetic method
in the calculation, while the English speakers‘ performance
may be negatively affected by increases in temporal
distance to be calculated if they are reciting sequences.

Method

Testing mechanisms indirectly
Participants

Kelly et al., (1999) reported that adult Chinese speakers
outperform their English-speaking counterparts in time
calculation tasks. This could be due to the differences in the
numerical transparency of time words in the languages they
speak. That is, the transparent numerical structure of
Chinese time words might facilitate time calculation, by
allowing Chinese speakers to employ arithmetic strategies
made possible by the use of numerical names. For example,
―Four days after Monday is what day?‖ translates to ―Four
days after Weekday one is what day?‖ To the Chinese
speaker, this directly evokes arithmetic, 4+1, and as a result,
they might be able to use arithmetic quickly to produce the
answer: ―Weekday five‖ (Friday). The same should be true
of making calculations about months. By contrast, English
speakers do not have the arithmetic laid out for them in
tasks like this, so they might rely on alternate strategies, like
reciting a sequence of days or months.
But Kelly et al.'s (1999) results could alternatively be the
result of other cultural differences, for instance, in the depth,
length, and nature of the math education each group
receives. It might be that the Chinese population that was
sampled simply was better at performing mental
calculations than their English-speaking counterparts.
Our experiment teases apart these two possibilities with a
nuanced design, based on three predictions. First, if the use
of different arithmetic strategies by Chinese and English
speakers is responsible for the performance difference, then
the Chinese advantage should disappear in cross-week or
cross-year calculations. Chinese speakers may encounter
difficulties in calculating distances across boundaries since
they have to convert the answers into modulo-7 or modulo12 systems; 3 days after ―weekday 5‖ is not ―weekday 8‖,
but rather 8 modulo 7, thus ―weekday 1‖; 3 months after
―month 11‖ is not ―month 14‖, but 14 modulo 12, thus
―month 2‖. If English speakers use a non-arithmetic strategy
by default, then they should exhibit less increase in
difficulty when calculating across boundaries.

Thirty-two (22 female and 10 male) native Chinese
speakers, college students from Beijing United College,
ranging in age from 18 to 31 (M = 21, SD = 4.9), and 40
native English speakers (19 female and 21 male),
undergraduate students at the University of Hawai‗i, aged
18 to 29 (M = 21, SD = 2.5), participated in the experiment
either for extra credit in an introductory linguistics class or
for five dollars or the equivalent.

Materials and design
Each participant completed two temporal reasoning tasks,
pertaining to DOW and MOY respectively. For each, we
manipulated two factors—Boundary Type (Within/Across
boundary) and Direction (Forward/Backward), which
produced four question types, as below (showing only
DOW). Both factors were manipulated within participants.
Language was a between-participants factor. An additional
factor, Sunday, applied only to the DOW blocks. Half of the
DOW questions involved Sunday, to reveal eventual effects
of this non-numerically-named day in Chinese.
(1a) If today is Monday, three days from now is what day?
(Within/Forward)
(1b) If today is Thursday, two days ago was what day?
(Within/Backward)
(2a) If today is Saturday, three days from now is what day?
(Across/Forward)
(2b) If today is Tuesday, five days ago was what day?
(Across/Backward)
Calculation distance differed across conditions; distance
ranged from 1 to 7 for DOW questions (1–4 for Within and
2–7 for Across) and 2 to 12 for MOY questions (2–10 for
Within and 2–12 for Across) in order to match the cyclical
nature of the weeks and months. There were 32 questions in
the DOW block and 48 in the MOY block.

= 18.537, p < 0.001; F2(1,28) = 24.596, p < 0.001. Once
again, Chinese speakers produced more errors in cross-week
calculations
compared
to
their
English-speaking
counterparts.

Procedure
Participants were seated in front of a computer. Each trial
began with a fixation cross in the center of the screen.
Participants initiated the trial by pressing the SPACE bar
when they were ready. They heard a recorded voice read a
question to them over headphones. They were instructed to
speak the answer as quickly and accurately as possible after
hearing the question into a microphone, which was used as a
voice key, connected to an E-Prime SR-BOX. A digital
recorder was also used to record the answers.
Four practice items preceded the experiment, which was
divided into two blocks, one for DOW and one for MOY.
Block order was counterbalanced across participants. The
questions were randomized within each block. There was a
short break between blocks.

(lower) task for Chinese and English speakers.

All filler syllables, tongue clicks, partial responses, and
repeated responses (due to failure to trigger the voice key)
were manually excluded. No participants were excluded
because of outlying RTs or low accuracy.

Questions involving Sunday As discussed in the Method
section, half of the DOW questions were Sunday-related
questions. These questions could have been the cause of the
Chinese speakers‘ low DOW accuracy if the irregular
Sunday term (―weekday sun‖ instead of ―weekday seven‖)
affected the use of an calculation strategy. Statistical
analysis confirms this. Chinese speakers were significantly
less accurate on Sunday questions than non-Sunday
questions, F1(1, 29) = 2.38, p = 0.024; F2(1, 30) = 2.83, p =
0.031, while English speakers were not sensitive to Sunday
and showed no difference in accuracy on Sunday questions
(see Figure 2).

Error analysis
Figure 1 shows mean accuracy for each Boundary Type and
Direction by language in the MOY and DOW tasks. We
performed separate repeated-measures ANOVAs with
participants (F1) and items (F2) as random factors. In the
participants analysis, Language (Chinese/English) was
between participants but Direction (Forward/Backward),
and Boundary Type (Within/Across) were within subjects.
For items, Language was a within-items factor and the other
factors (Boundary Type and Direction) were between-items.
As predicted, Chinese speakers made fewer errors than
English speakers on the MOY task—a main effect of
Language: F1(1,68) = 26.846, p < 0.001, F2(1, 44) = 54.265,
p < 0.001. However, as Figure 1 shows, this advantage was
carried by the Within Boundary questions, confirmed by an
interaction between Language and Boundary Type, F1 (1,
68) = 34.842, p < 0.001; F2 (1, 44) = 44.876, p < 0.001.
As the second part of Figure 1 shows, Language was a
less robust factor in the DOW task. The main effect of
Language did not reach significance by participants
analysis, but it did by items, F2(1, 28) = 5.177, p = 0.031.
This indicates that Chinese speakers did not have a global
accuracy advantage over English speakers. The lack of
Language effect was probably driven by the Chinese
speakers‘ relatively poor performance in the AcrossBoundary condition. As with MOY, an interaction effect

Reaction time analysis
All trials with incorrect responses were removed (16.7% of
the data). We also removed all responses that were greater

926

than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean of all responses
in each of the four conditions (Boundary Type x Direction)
for each language group. This excluded another 2.72% of
the data. No participants or items were removed for reasons
of accuracy or outlying SD. The reaction time data
approximate normal distribution after this cleaning.
Reaction times for correct responses were analyzed using a
repeated-measures ANOVA with Boundary Type
(Across/Within) and Direction (Forward/Backward) as
within-subject factors and Language (Chinese/English) as a
between-subject factor. An Item analysis took Language as
a within-items factor and Boundary Type and Direction as
between-items factors. The results in the MOY and DOW
tasks, seen in Figure 3, show mean reaction time for each
Boundary Type and Direction by language.
The results from MOY block mirrored the error analysis.
A large main effect of Language, F1(1, 68) = 36.155, p <
0.001, F2(1, 44) = 134.986, p < 0.001, confirmed that
Chinese speakers were faster than English speakers. There
were also significant interactions between Language and
Boundary Type, F1(1, 68) = 35.809, p < 0.001, F2(1, 44) =
9.613, p < 0.001, and between Language and Direction,
F1(1, 68) = 13. 423, p < 0.001, F2(1, 44) = 8.407, p = 0.006.
These effects showed that Chinese speakers gained more of
a speed advantage from Within month questions than
English speakers did, but that English speakers gained more
of an advantage from Forward calculations.

F2(1,28) = 27.446, p < 0.001, and the Forward questions
faster than the Backward ones, F1(1,68) = 42.243, p < 0.001,
F2(1,28) = 11.496, p = 0.002. There was also an interaction
between Language and Direction, F1(1,68) = 15.407, p <
0.001, F2(1,28) = 9.244, p = 0.005. English speakers were
much faster with Forward questions, F1(1,39) = 86.977, p <
0.001, F2(1,28) = 13.090, p = 0.001. Chinese speakers were
also faster in answering Forward questions than Backward
questions, but the difference was much smaller, F1(1,29) =
13.460, p = 0.001, F2(1,28) = 4.933, p = 0.035.
Questions involving Sunday The analysis of the accuracy
data above showed that Chinese speakers made more errors
on questions involving Sunday. But their reaction times
were unaffected, as Figure 4 shows. A two-way ANOVA
showed a main effect of Language, F1(1,68) = 15.681, p <
0.001, F2(1, 30) = 34.942, p < 0.001; Chinese speakers were
faster than English speakers. But there was no interaction.

Calculation Distance analysis
Because the mean distance varied across conditions, we also
did exploratory analyses by calculation distance, to see if
different calculation difficulty revealed strategy differences.
Reaction times by distance are presented in Figure 5.
As shown in Figure 5, the two language groups showed
different level of sensitivity to the distance calculated. The
Chinese speakers‘ reaction times were far less sensitive to
either distance or direction, especially in the within-week
condition. This is consistent with the hypothesis that they
were using addition and subtraction of small numbers. The
across-week condition is more complicated, as an extra step
of modulo calculation could have been involved for the
Chinese speakers.
The English speakers‘ reaction times were more strongly
affected by the length of temporal distances. As can be seen
on the right side of Figure 5, questions that required
backwards calculations took much longer than Forward
questions, presumably because counting backwards is less
familiar. Moreover, reaction times increase steadily as the
distances increase. The rise and drop of reaction times with
longer distances suggests that the English speakers were
applying different approaches when encountering calendar
questions with different distances. When the distances grew
longer, which makes verbal list counting a less efficient
strategy, they may have flexibly and strategically switched
to methods such as using numerical equivalents as a
shortcut to reciting the list, such as ―counting forward by the

Reaction time results from the DOW task are more
complicated because of the presence of Sunday. The
Chinese speakers were consistently faster than their Englishspeaking counterparts, as shown by a main effect of

et al., 1999). The partial use of an arithmetic strategy was
self-reported by some of the English participants in Kelly et
al.‘s work, and is consistent with the reaction time evidence
we find here.

Chinese Within-week

The year cycle has longer distances and so can provide
more information about strategies used in response to
possible calculation difficulties. The two language groups‘
reaction time data were categorized by distance for the
Within task and for the Across task, as shown in Figure 6.
Again, the Chinese speakers‘ reaction times were not
affected nearly as much as the English speakers' were by
calculation distance or direction, especially in the Within
Year tasks, again consistent with the possibility that they are
calculating arithmetically. On the other hand, the English
speakers present a more complicated picture of responding
to different distances. They were generally faster with
Forward than Backward questions, and they spent more time
when the distances got longer, except for the longest
distances (10 through 12), with which they might be using
strategies other than reciting due to the difficulty of
counting all the way through the month list.

Languages differ in how numerically transparent their time
words are, and we hypothesized that these differences would
affect the temporal cognition of adult speakers of languages
with distinct systems. Our results provide several types of
experimental evidence that Chinese and English speakers
use different strategies in temporal calculation tasks. As a
result, Chinese speakers determine temporal distance
calculations faster and more accurately. These findings are
not consistent with the hypothesis that other factors, such as
general mathematics ability, cause differences in overall
accuracy or speed.
There are three pieces of relevant evidence. First,
Chinese speakers were consistently more accurate in the
Within Week and Within Year tasks, but their accuracy
dropped significantly and their advantage disappeared with
calculations across week or year boundaries. In contrast, the
English speakers‘ answers were not particularly sensitive to
boundary crossings. For the reaction time results, although
the Chinese speakers were still faster than the English
speakers in the Across Boundary calculations, they were
slower compared to their own Within Week calculations. So
although arithmetic strategies for time may be advantageous
for some local calculations, the Chinese speakers‘ advantage
in accuracy and speed diminishes when answering questions
that involve temporal boundary crossings.
Second, the results confirmed that the irregularity of
Sunday‘s Chinese name causes trouble in applying the
arithmetic strategy, resulting in more mistakes by Chinese
speakers in answering questions involving Sunday
compared to calculations involving other days of the week.
By contrast, English speakers showed no increased
difficulty when making calculations relative to Sunday, and
their accuracy rates were not affected by questions
involving Sunday.
Finally, Chinese speakers‘ reactions seem not to
systematically relate to distance or directions of calculation,
whereas the English speakers' reaction times for Forward
calculations increase steadily and substantially, implying an

increase in time spent reciting day or month lists, and their
pattern on Backward questions were more complicated. We
hypothesized that versatile/mixed strategies might be used
due to the difficulty of reciting lists backwards.
In sum, these results suggest that differences in
calendar terms between the two languages lead to dominant
arithmetic or list-reciting strategies for speakers of those
languages. The verbal list strategy is substantially slower
than the number-transferring one, yet the latter results in
more possible errors across boundaries because of required
modulo 7 and modulo 12 calculations.
Previous cross-linguistic studies have shown that there is
at least some causal influence from language to non-verbal
cognition and unconscious habitual thought (Kay &
Kempton, 1984; Lucy, 1992; Gumperz & Levinson, 1996,
etc.). More specifically, the way time is described in a
language can affect its speakers‘ conceptualization of time
(Boroditsky, 2001) and can even shape low-level mental
processes in psychophysical tasks (Casasanto et al., in
revision). The current study adds to this line of study by
showing that transparent numerical structure of the calendar
might facilitate calendar calculation, causing Chinesespeaking adults to outperform their English-speaking
counterparts in time calculation tasks, by exhibiting shorter
reaction times and making fewer errors. We conclude that
adults' temporal reasoning abilities differ, depending on the
transparency of the naming systems that their languages
employ for time sequences. In general, such a finding
supports the hypothesis that linguistic differences can
produce non-linguistic consequences, in this case in
affecting people‘s reasoning about time (Boroditsky, 2000,
2003; Boroditsky & Ramscar, 2002, Matlock et al., 2005;
