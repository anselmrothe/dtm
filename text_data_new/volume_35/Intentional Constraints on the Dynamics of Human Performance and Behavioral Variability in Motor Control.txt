Abstract
Manipulation of environmental constraints has been shown to
influence the relative amounts of voluntary and involuntary
control employed by a person to complete a task, as well as
the resulting structure of performance variability. Generally,
the voluntary control required when no constraints are present
leads to self-similar changes in performance, some constraint
provides involuntary control that leads to random fluctuations
in performance, and constraint which provides feedback about
performance accuracy can result in anti-persistent variability.
The current study investigated whether providing two groups
of individuals with different intentions for the same task
would produce changes in voluntary and involuntary control
similar to that observed following the manipulation of task
constraints. Results indicated that a difference in intention
does result in divergent uses of voluntary and involuntary
control and distinctly different structures in performance
variability.
Key words: intention; fractal structure; voluntary and
involuntary control; motor control

Over the past decade, a substantial amount of research has
focused on determining what information can be gained
about human cognitive and motor processes by assuming
that they are inextricably linked through what is often
referred to as the ‘interaction-dominant dynamics’ of human
behavior (Holden, Van Orden, & Turvey, 2009; Ingber,
2003; Turvey, & Moreno, 2006; Van Orden, & Holden,
2002; Van Orden, Holden, & Turvey, 2003; Van Orden,
Holden, & Turvey, 2005). As noted by Van Orden (2010),
absolute independence of these processes would allow for
random variability in performance within each process,
while dominance by one process over all others would cause
highly regular fluctuations across processes. Standard, linear
statistical methods for assessing performance are based on
an assumption of random variability, or noise, in
performance and, necessarily, the belief that whatever
process is being evaluated can be thought of as independent
from all other contemporaneous processes. However,
methods for assessing potential structure within variability
over time reveal that while fluctuation in performance is

sometimes strictly random, more often variability is
characterized by patterns occurring at a variety of different
timescales (Ferrer-i-Cancho & Elvevag, 2010; Kiefer, Riley,
Shockley, Villard, & Van Orden, 2009; Eke, Herman,
Kocsis, & Kozak, 2002; Eke, Herman, Bassingthwaighte,
Raymond, Percival, Cannon, Balla, Ikrenyi, 2000; Gilden,
2001; Holden et al., 2009; Kuznetsov & Wallot, 2011;
Phillipe, 2000; Rhodes & Turvey, 2007; Wallot & Van
Orden, 2011a, b; Warren, Carciun, & Anderson--Butcher,
2005). This type of variability is neither strictly random, nor
strictly regular, but is rather somewhere in between the two,
and therefore suggestive of both competitive and
cooperative interactions between the different cognitive and
motor aspects of the behavior under observation (Van
Orden, 2010).
The patterned variability in performance described above
is defined by a fractal structure, in that self-similarity in
fluctuations is apparent at multiple timescales (Mandelbrot,
1982; Brown & Liebovitch, 2010; West & Deering, 1995).
This type of variability is typically referred to as ‘pink’
noise, in contrast to the ‘white’ noise of random fluctuation
(Van Orden, 2010). In order to determine what kind of
variability is occurring for a given task, it is important to
repeatedly measure some aspect of that task as performance
unfolds over time. The resulting series can then be broken
down into several composite, sinusoidal series each with a
different amplitude and frequency. A Power-Spectral
Density (PSD) analysis can then be used to give an
assessment of variability (Delignieres, Ramdani, Lemoine,
Torre, Fortes, & Ninot, 2006; Holden, 2005; Marmelat &
Delignieres, 2011). The slope of a regression line fit to a
plot of the logarithm of the power (amplitude squared) of
changes with the logarithm of their corresponding
frequencies provides a unique scaling relation between the
size and frequency of changes in the performance time
series. This scaling relation (S) is related to a characteristic
scaling exponent (α), where α = -S (Holden, 2005). It is this
scaling exponent which is used to give a qualitative
assessment of the type of variability being observed. Since
there will be no systematic relationship between the size and

3741

frequency of change with random variability, or ‘white
noise’, α ≈ 0. In contrast, the scaling relation for pink noise
reflects an inversely proportional relationship between the
power and frequency of variation such that the scaling
exponent associated with fractal variability is α ≈ 1. It is
also possible to obtain negative values for the scaling
exponent. This indicates a directly proportional relationship
between the size and frequency of changes in performance,
and occurs as a result of anti-persistent variation
(Delignieres & Torre, 2009; Hausdorff, Peng, Ladin, Wei,
& Goldberger, 1995; Schmidt, Beek, Treffner, & Turvey,
1991).
Strong support for interaction-dominant dynamics is
provided by the fact that the kind of variability observed in a
given task appears to be sensitive to a variety of task
characteristics (Chen, Ding, & Kelso, 2001; Delignières,
Torre, & Lemoine, 2009; Hausdorff, Purdon, Peng, Ladin,
Wei, & Goldberger, 1996; Holden, Choi, Amazeen, & Van
Orden, 2011; Jordan, Challis, & Newell, 2007a; Jordan,
Challis, & Newell, 2007b). Specifically, the level of task
constraint imposed by an experimental setup appears to be
directly predictive of variability structure, with greater
constraint resulting in white noise (α ≈ 0), and less
constraint leading to pink noise (α ≈ 1) (Chen et al., 2001;
Delignières et al., 2009; Hausdorff et al., 1996). This
phenomenon has led to the suggestion that environmental
constraint in the context of a specific task demand provides
some external control, while the absence of constraint given
the same task requires additional voluntary control on the
part of the actor (Van Orden, 2010).
One way to summarize the effects of voluntary and
involuntary control on variability is to examine different
conditions within rhythmic motor tasks. Previous studies
have demonstrated that by providing some sort of rhythmic
stimulus (e.g. metronome) while participants are required to
maintain a consistent movement pattern, spontaneous
entrainment between participant and stimulus will constrain
behavior and thus reduce the need for voluntary control of
movements, ultimately resulting in the random variations in
performance characterized by white noise (α ≈ 0) (Chen et
al., 2001). However, it appears that when participants are
explicitly instructed to coordinate with a rhythmic stimulus,
an altogether different pattern of variability emerges
(Delignières et al., 2009; Hausdorff et al., 1996). One might
imagine that the requirement to synchronize would
introduce the need for additional voluntary control but, more
importantly, it also appears to provide the participant with
feedback about the accuracy of their movements with
respect to the goal of the task (Van Orden, 2010). Accuracy
feedback has been considered a unique form of involuntary
control, and the constraint emerging from corrective
processes results in performance characterized by antipersistent, dependent fluctuations (α ≈ -1) (Delignieres &
Torre, 2009). An equivalent task to the two previous, but
requiring voluntary control, can be constructed through the
use of a continuation paradigm. Here the participant has the

opportunity to match their movement to an experimental
stimulus for several seconds at the beginning of a trial, and
then must maintain that movement pattern for the duration
of the trial without any involuntary control provided gained
through task constraint. Several studies have demonstrated
that the use of a continuation paradigm in this manner leads
to the self-similar variability of pink noise (α ≈ 1) (Chen et
al., 2001; Gilden, Thornton, & Mallon, 1995; Lemoine,
Torre, & Delignieres, 2006; Torre, & Delignières, 2008).
While previous findings have demonstrated an association
between voluntary or involuntary control and performance
variability, the potential influence of intending to control a
specific task dimension has yet to be examined. The current
study was designed to determine the effect of being asked to
control one of two task dimensions on performance
variability. In order to achieve this, a simple arm-swinging
task was employed during which participants were
instructed to control either the frequency or amplitude of
their movements, while being provided with flashing dots to
help control their performance. This ultimately created the
single underlying task of maintaining a comfortable,
consistent movement, allowing for an isolated evaluation of
the effects of intention on constraint and performance.

Method
Participants
Seventeen University of Cincinnati undergraduate students
participated in this experiment, eight in the amplitude
intention condition and nine in the frequency intention
condition. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 28 years.

Procedure and Design
At the beginning of the experiment, participants were
instructed to stand at a distance 3.5 feet in front of a flat
screen television, facing toward the screen. The
experimental task consisted of holding one’s upper right
arm flush with the side of the body and swinging the
forearm in an arc about the elbow, while keeping the
forearm parallel to the floor. The right hand was to be held
in a fist with the first two fingers extended to point toward
the screen and with the knuckles facing toward the right,
away from the participant’s body. Initially, two red dots (5.5
cm in diameter) appeared on the screen, centered vertically
and separated by a distance of 57 cm (see Varlet, Coey,
Schmidt, & Richardson, 2011 for information on
determining the ideal stimulus amplitude for visuomotor
entrainment).
Eight participants were asked to control the amplitude of
their movements by traveling the same distance with every
arm swing. The other nine participants were asked to control
the frequency of their movements by maintaining a constant
speed while swinging. All participants participated in two
trials, each six minutes in length. The first trial involved a
continuation paradigm, with the red dots appearing for the
first 10-12 seconds (timed manually), followed by a blank

3742

screen for the duration. This trial was collected as a
baseline. The red dots were set to flash in an alternating
pattern at a frequency of 1 Hz, (with a dot appearing on one
or the other side of the screen every 500 ms) throughout the
time they were visible. Participants were instructed to use
the dots to help control their designated task dimension, and
to do their best to maintain the same movement for the
duration of the trial once the dots had disappeared. In the
second trial, the flashing dots were displayed for the full six
minutes and participants were instructed to use them over
the entire trial to help achieve consistency in their
designated task dimension. This was the test trial.
By using a comfortable movement frequency for the
flashing dots, we expected participants in the frequency
intention condition to use the dots to gain feedback about
the consistency of their speed in order to engage in
corrective processes. For those participants in the amplitude
intention condition we expected the stimulus to provide the
opportunity for spontaneous entrainment, but not enough
feedback about the size of their movements to allow for
corrective processes.
The display was generated by an application written using
C/C++ and displayed using OpenGL. Data was collected
using a magnetic tracking system (Polhemus Fastrak,
Polhemus Corporation, Colchester, VT), with the sensor
attached to the outside of the extended first two fingers of
the right hand. The OpenGL program was also used to
record the movement data collected by the tracking system,
with a sampling rate of 60 Hz.

Data Analysis
All participant movement time-series were low-pass filtered
using a 10 Hz Butterworth filter and the first and last 5 s of
each trial were discarded to remove transients.
For the PSD analysis, the peak to valley intervals and
valley to peak intervals were extracted from the movement
time-series for each trial. The PSD analysis was then used to
assess fractal characteristics of the resultant interval timeseries. As the preliminary step to this process each timeseries was submitted to a Fourier transform, during which it
was broken down into several composite sinusoidal series
with varying amplitudes and frequencies. The slope of a
regression line fitted to the spectral plot of the logarithm of
the power vs. the logarithm of the frequency for each
sinusoidal series yielded a unique value S, for which the
characteristic scaling exponent of the series, α, is equal to –S
(Holden, 2005).
In order to assess possible entrainment of participants’
movement to the frequency of the flashing stimulus we
found, for each trial, the distribution of relative phase angles
occurring between the participant and stimulus time-series.
This distribution was based on the proportion of discrete
relative phase (DRP) angles between the two time-series
which fell into each of nine bins (0°-20°, 20°-40°, 40°-60°,
60°-80°, 80°-100°, 100°-120°, 120°-140°, 140°-160°, and
160°-180°). DRP values were calculated at each oscillatory

peak of the movement time-series. Perfect, inphase
coordination between participant and stimulus would result
in a relative phase of 0°, while antiphase coordination, in
which participants exactly matching the frequency of
stimulus movement but pointed at the side of the screen
opposite the dot each time, would lead to a relative phase of
180°.
The stability of any unintentional coordination was
established by calculating the circular variance of the
relative phase angles found between the participant and
stimulus time-series for each trial. This measure provides an
index of synchronization on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0
reflecting a situation in which there is no coordination
between participant and stimulus movements, and 1
indicating absolute synchronization between the two
(Batschelet, 1981; Oullier, de Guzman, Jantzen, Lagarde, &
Kelso, 2008).

Results
A 2 (intention) x 2 (trial) mixed model ANOVA on circular
variance values revealed a significant main effect for trial, F
(1, 15) = 39.93, p = .001, ηp2 = .73, and a significant
interaction between intention and trial, F (1, 15) = 6.21, p =
.03, ηp2 = .29. This interaction appears to be driven by the
fact that the effects of intention are different for the baseline
and test conditions (see Figure 1). While there did not
appear to be a significant change in coordination stability
for those with the intention to contol amplitude, the
difference for those in the frequency intention condition
between baseline and test was significant, t (8) = -10.13, p
= .001.
A 2 (intention) x 2 (trial) x 9 (relative phase bin) mixed
model ANOVA on the DRP between participant and
stimulus movements revealed a main effect for relative
phase bin, F (8, 15) = 81.86, p = .001, ηp2 = .85, significant
two-way interactions between intention and relative phase
bin, F (8, 15) = 4.62, p = .001, ηp2 = .24, and trial and
relative phase bin, F (8, 15) = 105.76, p = .001, ηp2 = .88,
and a significant three-way interaction between intention,
trial and relative phase bin, F (8, 15) = 2.06, p = .045, ηp2 =
.12. Follow-up analyses revealed a significant interaction
between intention and relative phase bin for the test trials, F
(8, 120) = 4.64, p = .001, ηp2 = .24, but not for the baseline
trials (see Figure 2). A comparison of the proportion of time
spent in the DRP bin associated with inphase coordination
(0°-20°) during the test trial between the two intention
conditions revealed that significantly more in-phase
entrainment occurred for those participants instructed to
control movement frequency, F (1, 15) = 6.96, p = .02, ηp2 =
32. There was no significant difference in the proportion of
time spent in the DRP bin associated with antiphase
coordination (160°-180°) between the two intention
conditions.
The results of a 2 (intention) x 2 (trial) mixed model
ANOVA on scaling relations (S) from the PSD analysis
were similar to those of the ANOVA on circular variance.

There was a significant main effect for trial, F (1, 15) =
46.83, p = .001, ηp2 = .76, and a significant interaction
between intention and trial, F (1, 15) = 5.12, p = .04, ηp2 =
.25. As seen in Figure 3, this interaction appears to be
driven by the difference in the effects of intention between
the baseline and test conditions, with a much larger increase
in α occurring in the frequency intention than the amplitude
intention. The α values for both intention conditions during
the baseline trials were closest to the region associated with
pink noise (S ≈ -1, α ≈ 1). The α values for those intending
to control amplitude during the test condition were
characteristic of white noise (S ≈ 0, α ≈ 0), while those for
participants asked to control movement frequency were
closer to the region associated with anti-persistent,
dependent behavior (S ≈ 1, α ≈ -1).
Given evidence that the effects of intention condition
were most apparent during the test trials for both
coordination strength and scaling relation, we chose to
conduct a regression to determine whether circular variance
could account for variation in scaling relation above and
beyond that accounted for by intentional condition. A
forward regression indicated that intention explained a
significant proportion of variation in scaling relation, R2 =
.42, F (1, 15) = 10.86, p = .005, and was significantly
predictive of scaling relation, b = .65, t (15) = 3.30, p =
.005, for the test trials. However, the predictive contribution
of circular variance was not significant, as it only accounted
for an additional 2.8% of the variance in scaling relation
above and beyond that accounted for by intention.

Discussion
The task in the current study was constructed to
demonstrate the effects of assigning participants different
intentions for a simple motor task, as examined in
performance variability and the employment of voluntary
and involuntary control.

which are referred to be the lowest and highest possible
DRP values, respectively.
The two different intention conditions introduced are
essentially equivalent with respect to a participant’s
resulting movement; maintaining a consistent speed will
result in relatively consistent spacing between movements,
and vice versa. As such, one might predict that providing
participants with the instruction to control speed versus
distance would have no effect on the amount of voluntary or
involuntary control required to complete the task, and
therefore no effect on the structure of performance
variability. This does appear to be the case for the baseline
trials. Consistent with previous use of continuation
paradigms, measures of performance variability structure for

3744

both intentions during the baseline trials fell within the
region associated with self-similar, pink noise thought to
indicate the use of voluntary control (Chen et al., 2001;

Delignières, 2008).
The equivalency in performance variability structure
between the intention conditions was not, however,
maintained during the test trials. In this case, past research
universally predicts that the presence of a rhythmic stimulus
will provide a source of involuntary control for the
movement task (Chen et al., 2001; Delignieres & Torre,
2009). As previously described, the difference in participant
instructions with respect to the use of a rhythmic stimulus
can result in two distinct kinds of structure in performance
variability. While the mere presence of a rhythmic stimulus
results in entrainment and random variability (Chen et al.,
2001), the instruction to synchronize with the stimulus and
the resulting opportunity to gain accuracy feedback about
one’s performance leads to anti-persistent changes
(Delignieres & Torre, 2009). In the current study, the
instructions about use of the stimulus were the same for all
participants; they were simply told to use the stimulus to
help control their movement, following an explanation
about what their intention for the task should be. The
difference in intention alone appears to have affected the
influence, and constraint, of the rhythmic stimulus on the
structure of performance variability.
For those participants who were asked to control the
amplitude of their movements, changes in performance
during the test trial were found to be random, corresponding
to white noise. This suggests that for someone intending to
control the amplitude of their movements, the rhythmic
stimulus provided involuntary control, but did not allow for
sufficient accuracy feedback for corrective anti-persistent
movement modulation. In contrast, for the participants

intending to control the frequency of their movements,
measurements of variability structure were in the range
associated with anti-persistent behavior. It therefore appears
that the stimulus did allow for enough accuracy feedback
about the timing of movements to support corrective
processes by the participant. It is worth noting that the
difference in intention conditions during the test trials was
associated with differences in coordination, as well as the
structure of performance variability. While there was
significantly more inphase coordination between participant
and stimulus movements for those intending to control
frequency, any variation in performance associated with
changes in coordination stability appears to be accounted for
by intention.
In conclusion, our study has shown that the manipulation
of intention alone appears to affect the use of voluntary and
involuntary control for an environmentally constrained
motor task, as reflected by differences in performance
variability. These results also demonstrate that intending to
control one specific task dimension over another can
substantially alter the influence of any present
environmental constraints. Therefore, in addition to
identifying the role of intention in performance variability
as an area worth further exploration, this study also sounds a
cautionary note for research that aims to better understand
the recruitment of voluntary and involuntary control and
performance variability.
