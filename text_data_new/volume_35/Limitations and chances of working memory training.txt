Abstract
Recent studies show controversial results on the trainability
of working memory (WM) capacity being a limiting factor of
human cognition. In order to contribute to this open question
we investigated if participants improve in trained tasks and
whether gains generalize to untrained WM tasks,
mathematical problem solving and intelligence tests.
83 adults trained over a three week period (7.5 hours total) in
one of the following conditions: A high, a medium or a low
WM load group. The present findings show that task specific
characteristics could be learned but that there was no transfer
between trained and untrained tasks which had no common
elements. Positive transfer occurred between two tasks
focusing on inhibitory processes. It might be possible to
enhance this specific component of WM but not WM capacity
as such. A possible enhancement in a learning test is of high
educational interest and worthwhile to be investigated further.

Theoretical Background
The concept of WM has received much attention lately by
various psychological disciplines for its importance as a
basis of human intelligence and as a limiting factor of
human cognition. WM can be seen as a cognitive system for
simultaneously storing and manipulating information, and
hence strongly relates to reasoning abilities and the handling
of novel information (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). Also the
attention to goal-relevant information and inhibition of
irrelevant information are important functions of WM.
High correlations between WM capacity and intelligence
(Oberauer, Süss, Wilhelm, & Wittmann, 2008), notably
when measured by Matrices Tests (e.g. Advanced
Progressive Matrices Test; Raven, 1990) as well as high
correlations between WM capacity and applied fields, e.g.
mathematical problem solving tasks leave the following
open question: What happens to intelligence and

mathematical problem solving skills when WM capacity
potentially gets enhanced? One possibility could be a
likewise enhancement of WM and intelligence (and
mathematical problem solving skills). The similarity of the
two concepts would make far transfer plausible. But as
stated earlier, results are controversial and more evidence is
needed.
Early studies were positive in judging the possibility of a
WM training being able to enhance WM capacity and
performance in related fields. These early studies were also
more explorative in nature. Later studies took criticism
(Moody, 2009; Sternberg, 2008) into consideration and the
complexity of study designs has been raised (for example by
Redick et al. (2012) a non-replication of the study by Jaeggi,
Buschkuehl, Jonides, & Perrig, (2008)). In the current study
the following criticisms of the past studies are taken into
consideration and examined: a) inclusion of an active
control group, b) administering a wide variety of transfer
tasks and c) examining long term effects.
The trainability of WM capacity would mean that we are
able to broaden an important limiting factor of human
cognition and this would be of highly practical as well as of
seminal educational relevance. There is a growing body of
WM training literature (Chein & Morrison, 2010;
Klingberg, 2010; Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, 2012).
Melby-Lervåg and Hulme (2012) conducted a meta-analytic
study and compared effects: Across training studies, effects
vary in whether WM training paradigms are effective in
improving cognitive abilities.
We included three training groups: a high, a medium and
a high WM load group. Their training differed in the
amount as well as in the type of WM load included. The
first two groups focused on resolution of proactive
interference – an ability tapping the WM subcomponent of
inhibition, which is regarded as critical subcomponent of
WM (Friedman & Miyake, 2004). The third group was an
active control group (low to zero WM load) solving a
control reaction time task. The further manipulations

3175

referred to whether the task was adaptive and whether the
task was dual. If WM load during training is the crucial
factor for transfer effects to occur there should of course be
no training gains for control groups and gains should be
more pronounced for a high than for a medium WM load
group. The advantage of a graded design lies in being able
to differentiate whether a transfer gain can be attributed to
enhanced WM capacity or not.
The inclusion of a wide variety of transfer tasks is
necessary to decide whether changes can be attributed to an
enhancement of WM capacity or merely to task specific
learning because an enhancement of WM capacity can only
be demonstrated if transfer occurs generally and is not
limited to single tasks (Shipstead et al., 2012). In the present
study transfer to an untrained WM task is referred to as near
transfer and transfer to tasks with another cognitive demand
than WM is categorized as far transfer. Far transfer is
typically measured using intelligence tests as well as other
reasoning tests. In addition to intelligence tests, in the
present study mathematical tasks are administered to assess
possible far transfer to school-related abilities. According to
a literature review by Raghubar, Barnes, and Hecht (2010),
WM and skills in mathematical problem solving are highly
correlated, in particular mental arithmetic, and are therefore
suitable as transfer tasks.
In sum, the main goal of the current study is to test a)
whether a WM training yields near transfer, an enhancement
of performance in untrained WM tasks, and b) to
systematically test whether such a potential WM
enhancement can provoke far transfer in the domain of
intelligence and mathematical problem solving and whether
such an enhancement is depending on the amount of WM
load during training. Further we investigate to what extent
training gains are found in an active control group, to what
extent enhancement of performance is dependent on to the
level of WM load during training and how stable these
effects are.

Method
Participants
A total of 83 healthy students of science- and humanitiesrelated fields from three Swiss universities completed the
study (Mage = 23.7, SD = 3.3).Eight participants dropped out
due to installation problems of the training software on their
home computer (5 participants) or due to non-adherence to
the training paradigms or sessions at the institute (3
participants).

Procedure
Participants were randomly designed to one of three
groups: A high, a medium or a low WM load group. All
groups trained during a three week period five days a week
for half an hour on their home computer, resulting in a total
training time of 7.5 hours. The first and the last training
session were completed at the institute in order to ensure
understanding of the tasks and to control for the correct

handling of the training software. Solution rates and times
as well as other parameters were logged by the training
software for all sessions. Before and after training, two
assessment sessions took place at the first author’s institute:
An individual and a group session where participants had to
solve WM tasks and a mental arithmetic task, mathematical
problem solving tasks and intelligence tests. The sessions
before training served to assess baseline performance and
the sessions after training aimed to assess possible transfer
from the WM training. In order to make an intervention and
a possible enhancement meaningful it should show an
impact over a certain time. Long term training effects were
assessed by a follow-up testing session after a three months
period. Participants again solved trained tasks as well as
paralleled versions of untrained tasks.
The three groups did not differ significantly in their initial
intelligence level, in demographical factors (age, sex, field
of study) and in personality factors (measured by the NEOFFI (Costa & McCrae 1992)). Their initial performance of
training and transfer tasks was also in the same range and
didn’t differ significantly between groups.

Material
Training
A high WM load group trained a dual version of the nback task, similar to Jaeggi et al. (2008). Simultaneously,
letters were presented orally and squares visually at
different positions on the screen. Participants had to indicate
whether the letter and the position n trials back was the
same or not. This adaptive and dual version of the n-back
task placed high WM load because a large amount of
interference trials was incorporated. Also the duality of the
task adds to the high WM load level. Through the dual
nature of the task participants trained the visual and oral
domain simultaneously. Participants worked on the task for
30 minutes per day with the size of n adapted to the actual
level of performance. In this group the average n-back level
was assessed.
The medium WM load group trained with three nonadaptive WM tasks: A three-back task with letters and the
following two recognition tasks. In the face recognition task
participants had to decide whether a single face was part of
a previously presented set of four faces or not. In the letter
recognition task participants had to decide whether a letter
was part of the previously presented set of four letters or
not. The tasks were characterized by moderate WM load
with a focus on resolution of proactive interference in WM.
Solution times and rates were measured and each task was
performed for 10 minutes. In all three tasks, a high level of
interference was produced by incorporating a large amount
of lure trials, i.e., trials in which the objects were shown in
another trial than the one actually referred to.
The low WM load group trained similar tasks as the
medium WM load group, but with a very low WM load.
Participants had to solve a 1-back task and for the
recognition tasks participants had to compare one face/letter

3176

with a previously presented single face/letter. Solution time
and rates were measured.
The amount of WM load is not the only variation between
the three groups but all other differences as for example
duality vs. singularity of the task can also be seen as a
variation of the level of WM load.
Tasks to assess near transfer
The four WM transfer tasks each represented a different
subcomponent of WM and showed varying similarities to
the trained tasks. In the complex span task participants
solved simple equations while keeping single letters in
mind. At task switching participants had to either decide
whether the value of a three digit number was below or
above 500, or whether the number was even or odd. In a
monitoring task participants had to detect changes in a grid
of nine three-digit-numbers and react on certain
constellations of same final digits. A forth WM transfer task
was kept very similar to a trained task of the medium WM
load group. In this so called ‘pseudowords’-task,
participants of the medium WM load group had to
accomplish the same task requirements as in their trained
letter recognition task and also the trained face recognition
task was very similar. The mentioned transfer and training
tasks showed the same surface structure but other content
material than the trained task: Recognition of pseudowords,
nonsense syllables obeying phonetic rules, in the transfer
situation instead of the trained recognition of single letters
or faces. For the control group the same was true except that
they trained task versions with minimal WM load. The high
WM load group on contrary had no correspondent training.
Tasks to assess far transfer
As fluid intelligence tests the Advanced Progressive
Matrices Test (APM, Set II) by Raven (1990) and the
‘Intelligenz-Struktur-Test’ (I-S-T 2000 R) by Amthauer,
Brocke, Liepmann, and Beauducel (2001) were
administered.
The three transfer tasks of the mathematical domain
consisted of different levels of reasoning requirements and
complexity. A mental arithmetic task with subtractions of
two digit numbers with carries was conducted without
participants taking any notes. A so-called mathematics test
(Mathematik-Test, Ibrahimovic & Bulheller, 2005) was
exhibited to test participants’ ability to solve mathematical
word problems. In a last mathematical task with high WM
load participants had to keep in mind three simple but
interlinked equations as well as the value of the three
unknowns.
Learning of novel material
We further investigated whether WM training can
enhance the learning of novel material. In this task
participants learned to calculate in the septimal system (base
7 system) while inhibiting their usual counting routines of
the decimal system. This learning task was presented
immediately after the last training session and in order to
assess the learning of new principles and the establishing of
new routines while overcoming well-trained ones the task
comprised of a 40 min problem solving period with a total

of 150 trials of additions in the septimal system. This design
enables us to investigate the possibility of not only having
WM training enhance certain untrained WM tasks, but also
enhance the chance of grasping and administering new
principles and rules. This would be new and very tempting
for educational purposes.

Results
In the medium and high WM load groups the
implementation check was positive in that through training
participants enhanced their performance significantly in
trained tasks. The medium WM load group showed
significant increases in solution time and solution rate in the
three trained tasks. The high WM load group showed
significant increase in the average n-back-level. Participants
of the low WM load group also significantly increased their
solution times, but not solution rates (see Appendix, Table
1).
Enhancements specific to groups occurred in two of nine
untrained tasks. First, group specific enhancements occurred
in the ‘pseudowords’ task. An ANOVA for reaction time
measures with the between subject factor group and the
within subject factor time was conducted. A significant
interaction between time and group (F(2.99, 118.09) =
22.92, p <.001, η2p = .37; see also Figure 1 and Appendix
Table 2) and pairwise comparisons revealed that the
medium and low WM load groups likewise accelerated
more than the high WM load group, which showed only
slight enhancement. This analysis also showed a significant
main effect time as all participants got faster (F(1.50,
118.09) = 136.18, p <.001, η2p = .63).

groups.
The second differential transfer gain occurred in the one
learning task. In the ‘Base7’ task groups varied in their

3177

amount of gain manifesting in a significant interaction
between groups and beginning versus end of the test
(F(11.19, 447.74) = 2.15, p <.05, η2p =.05). Post hoc tests
showed that the high WM load group showed a higher
degree of progress than the low WM load group over the
course of the 150 trials (see Figure 2). In this task all groups
enhanced their performance significantly over the 150 trials
(F(5.60, 447.74) = 32.67, p <.001, η2p =.29).
No differential transfer occurred in any of the
mathematical problem solving tasks or in the intelligence
tests, therefore in none of the untrained WM tasks such
interactions were found. However, there was a significant
temporary enhancement of solution times and rates for all
transfer tasks, but with no difference between the three
groups, as no interaction was detected (see table 2 for
changes from pre- to post-measure).
Long term gains over a three month period were found in
some tasks, but no differences between the three groups
were found. The only exception is the aforementioned
recognition task ‘pseudowords’, where differential changes
between pre- and post-tests could be held throughout the
three months.

of the test, 10 trials are summarized into one part. Please
note, that there is a significant interaction between part (115) and group (low, medium and high WM load).

Discussion
The actual focus of the present study are the questions to
what extent training gains are found in an active control
group, to what extent enhancement of performance is
dependent on to the level of WM load during training, what
near and far transfer effects can be observed and how stable
these effects are. Only in two out of nine cases were such
differential enhancements found. In all other untrained WM
tasks no such interactions were found so that no positive
transfer specific to medium or high WM load during
training occurred in any of the mathematical problem

solving tasks or in any intelligence tests. According to
Shipstead et al. (2012) it is crucial to compare a wide
variety of tasks to decide where the reason of changes may
lie. Generally occurring transfer effects could be attributed
to an enhancement of WM capacity whereas rare transfer
should be explained by only task specific learning. For the
present study it can therefore be concluded that no
enhancement of WM capacity as such is found.
The two cases of group specific enhancement are
discussed separately. First, differential enhancement
occurred in one untrained task with a similar surface
structure but different content material than in the trained
tasks of the medium WM load group (recognition of
‘pseudowords’ instead of recognition of letters). Also the
low WM load group trained a recognition task with the
same surface structure but minimal WM load. Both the
medium and low WM load group developed similarly, this
suggests that high WM load was not essential for the
development, but rather the similarity of the trained and
untrained task. This explains why the development of the
low WM load group was likewise the one of the medium
WM load group and why the high WM load group –
training with a very different paradigm but being exposed to
high WM load during training – developed in a different
way. In conclusion, training gains can transfer to very
similar tasks only. The similarity of the tasks or in other
words the common elements of trained and untrained tasks
are crucial for transfer.
Second, in the ‘Base7’ learning task all groups enhanced
their performance significantly over the 150 trials, but the
high WM load group showed a higher progress than the low
WM load group. The trained dual n-back task of the high
WM load group and the ‘Base7’ task at their surface show
no similarity but both tasks particularly focused on
inhibitory processes. It can therefore be concluded, that
inhibitory processes could possibly be enhanced through a
specific training focusing on inhibition. In order to
exclusively answer this assumption more evidence would be
needed to exclude the possibility of just task specific
characteristics being responsible for this result. Moreover,
this gain was measured in a novel task type: A learning task
– to our knowledge not administered in any other WM
training study and the only learning task included in the
present WM training study. The possible enhancement in a
learning test is of high educational interest and also has to
be verified by further testing.
There was significant general enhancement of solution
times and solution rates for all transfer tasks, but no
difference between the three groups for seven of nine tasks.
As also the low WM load group with virtually zero WM
load during training got significantly better from pre- to
post-test, enhancement cannot be explained by expanded
WM capacity. It can therefore be stated that participants
perform significantly better after WM training but not due
the characteristics of the training and not due to an
enhancement of WM capacity.

Numerous authors (Chein & Morrison, 2010; Moody,
2009; Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, 2010; Shipstead et al.,
2012; Sternberg, 2008) judge the selection of an appropriate
control group as essential in interpreting data. In the present
study the low WM load group served as an active control
group and also increased their performance. Through an
active control group effects due to a different degree of
study involvement can be ruled out.
Long term gains over a three month period were found in
some tasks, but no differences between the three groups
were found. The only exception is the aforementioned
recognition task where the differential changes between pre
and post testing could be held throughout the three months.
In summary, the theoretical and educational significance
of the present results are threefold. First, our results suggest
that WM training is of limited use to enhance human
cognition in general. The present findings show that task
specific characteristics could be learned but that there was
no transfer between trained and untrained tasks which had
no common elements. Second, as positive transfer occurred
between two tasks focusing on inhibitory processes, it might
be possible to enhance this specific component of WM.
Third, the possible enhancement in a learning test is of high
educational interest and is worthwhile to be further
investigated.
