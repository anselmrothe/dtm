Abstract
This article reports on an experiment in which artificial languages with whistle words for novel objects are culturally
transmitted in the laboratory. The aim of this study is to investigate the origins and evolution of combinatorial structure
in speech. Participants learned the whistled language and reproduced the sounds with the use of a slide whistle. Their
reproductions were used as input for the next participant. Cultural transmission caused the whistled systems to become more
learnable and more structured. In addition, two conditions
were studied: one in which the use of iconic form-meaning
mappings was possible and one in which the use of iconic mappings was experimentally made impossible, so that we could
investigate the influence of iconicity on the emergence of structure.

the hypothesis that Hockett (1960) introduced when he linked
the emergence of structure to vocabulary expansion and signal dispersal. Even in the case where only a small set of
sounds is transmitted and the signal space is not maximally
used, combinatorial structure emerges (Verhoef et al., 2011;
Verhoef, 2012). In that experiment the influence of semantics
was controlled for and the signals did not refer to any concrete
meanings. Obviously, in natural human languages meanings
are important and the role of semantics in the evolution of
linguistic structure should not be ignored (Schouwstra, 2012;
Dingemanse, 2012). Would the introduction of semantics influence the emergence of combinatorial structure at the level
of phonology? In this article a new experiment is presented in
which artificial whistled languages are culturally transmitted
and the whistled signals refer to meanings.

Introduction
Duality of patterning, one of Hockett’s (1960) basic design
features of language, has recently received increased attention (de Boer, Sandler, & Kirby, 2012). This feature describes how, in speech, a limited number of meaningless
sounds are combined into meaningful words and those meaningful words are combined into larger constructs. How this
feature emerged in language is currently still a matter of debate, but it is increasingly being studied with the use of a
variety of different techniques such as computer simulations
and laboratory experiments. In one of these laboratory experiments, the emergence of combinatorial structure was studied
through transmission of artificial whistled languages in the
laboratory (Verhoef, Kirby, & Padden, 2011). For this study
the experimental iterated learning paradigm (Kirby, Cornish,
& Smith, 2008) was used. Iterated learning refers to the process of cultural transmission, in which individuals acquire a
social behavior by observing the performance of others who
also acquired it from observation (Kirby et al., 2008). The
results demonstrated that sound systems, when passed on in
a transmission chain, adapt to cognitive biases and become
easier to learn (Verhoef et al., 2011). Combinatorial structure emerged and the whistled systems became more efficiently coded over generations (Verhoef, 2012). These results demonstrated a possible route towards the emergence
of structure in the sounds of speech. The findings challenge

Combinatorial structure versus iconicity
Arbitrariness was another design feature Hockett (1960)
listed for language. This feature refers to the arbitrary mapping between words and their meaning. Hockett uses the
words ‘whale’ and ‘microorganism’ as an example: ‘whale’
is a short word for a large animal, while ‘microorganism’ is
the reverse. It has been argued that non-arbitrariness is rare
in modern languages and that it is irrelevant for understanding linguistic structure (Newmeyer, 1992). More recently,
however, researchers began to realize that non-arbitrary formmeaning mappings may be more widespread than initially
thought. When exploring beyond Indo-European languages,
non-arbitrariness seems to play a role in many languages
(Imai, Kita, Nagumo, & Okada, 2008; Dingemanse, 2012).
This involves classes of words where for instance the shape,
complexity, sound or some other characteristic of the meaning expressed is mimicked or iconically represented in the
word. Examples have been identified as ‘ideophones’,
‘mimetics’ or ‘expressives’ and the phenomenon is often
called sound symbolism.
Sound symbolic mappings in language have been connected to cross-modal mappings in the human brain (Simner,
Cuskley, & Kirby, 2010; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001).
There appear to be many cognitive biases in cross-modal perception that are shared by most people. The bouba/kiki ef-

3669

fect is one famous example that shows a strong preference
to relate sharp shapes to the name ‘kiki’ and round shapes to
the name ‘bouba’ (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001). Such
shared biases have been argued to play an important role in
the evolution of language, by forming a starting point for
the initial emergence of grounded speech (Ramachandran &
Hubbard, 2001).
A newly emerging sign language, Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign
Language (ABSL), has recently been described, in which
the evolution of duality of patterning can still be observed
(Sandler, Aronoff, Meir, & Padden, 2011). Even though
ABSL is a fully functional and expressive sign language, its
combinatorial structure appears to be less discrete (Sandler
et al., 2011). Could it be the case that this young sign language was able to survive up to now without duality of patterning because the manual modality allows for much iconicity and the language is learnable and transmissible enough
without phonological structure? When most mappings are
transparent, they may be more intuitive and easier to remember as holistic entities. On the other hand, it has been shown
that there is actually an advantage for arbitrary mappings
in acquiring word meanings in context (Monaghan, Christiansen, & Fitneva, 2011). A secondary objective of the experiment described below is to investigate how iconic formmeaning mappings influence the emergence of combinatorial sub-lexical structure. The experiment is similar to the
experiment described by Verhoef et al. (2011) and Verhoef
(2012), but with meanings attached to the whistled signals.
Two conditions were studied: one in which the use of iconic
form-meaning mappings is possible and one in which the
use of iconic mappings is experimentally made impossible.
This was expected to provide insight into the possible role
of iconicity in the emergence of duality of patterning since it
could reveal whether a situation that allows for more iconicity, can ‘survive’ without the emergence of combinatorial
structure longer.
In summary, the objective of this study is as follows. First
and foremost, we investigate whether the addition of meanings leads to a result that is similar to what was found in the
whistle experiment without meanings, to see if combinatorial
structure also emerges in the presence of semantics. Second,
we search for any differences between the two conditions to
see whether iconicity could cause a delay in the emergence of
structure.

Method
In this experiment participants were asked to learn and reproduce whistled signals with a slide whistle (see figure 1) as
names for objects they saw on a computer screen. There were
twelve whistled signals in the training set in total.
The meanings were unusual objects that look like possible mechanical parts, but they are novel objects for which
we do not have words in existing languages. The objects
were a subset from those created by Smith, Smith, and Blythe
(2011) that were slightly modified. To reduce the structure in

Figure 1: Slide whistle
the meaning space, all objects were transformed to blue tone
and could therefore not be grouped by their color. They also
did not share shapes or parts and were not structured in any
other obvious way. This was needed to limit the emergence
of semantics-related compositional structure. A few examples of objects that were used are shown in figure 2.

Figure 2: Examples of novel objects used in the experiment
Following the paradigm of experimental iterated learning
(Kirby et al., 2008), the last whistle sounds that a participant
produced for each object were used as the input given to the
next participant. However, this is the point where the two conditions differ from each other. In one condition, the ‘intact’
transmission, the next participant was exposed to the output
of the previous participant exactly as it was produced. The
mapping from whistled signals to objects was kept intact. In
the other condition, the ‘scrambled’ transmission, the output
of the previous participant was altered before it was given to
the next person. The produced form-meaning mappings were
broken down by scrambling the mappings at each change of
generation and by using a different set of objects between
consecutive generations. In this way, if there were any iconic
relations to emerge in the sets, it would only be helpful for the
participants in the first condition and any semantics-related
structure is broken down in between the transmission steps.
Only the signal sets themselves stay intact.

Procedure
During the experiment participants completed three rounds
of learning and recall, which were alternated by ‘guessing
game’ rounds. In the learning phase the objects and their corresponding whistle were presented one by one in a random
order, and participants recorded an imitation of the whistle. In
the recall phase a panel was shown with a button for each object and the participant had to choose each of the objects once
to record the right whistle for it from memory. The guessing
phases were introduced to encourage people to keep paying
attention to the mapping between whistle sounds to objects.
In this phase the whistles were played one by one in a random order and for each whistle the participant had to choose

In total 64 participants took part in the experiment. They were
divided over eight transmission chains, four in each condition. Participants were recruited from the University of Amsterdam community through posters and e-mail invitations.
All participants were between the ages of 19 and 41 years
old, 43 were female and 21 male. In each chain either two
or three men participated. They were compensated for their
time with a cash payment of 10 euros.

Qualitative results

On the level of the signals, independent of the objects they refer to, it can be observed that structure develops in a manner
that is very similar to what could be observed in the experiment without meanings. Like in that experiment, whistles
were introduced that were clearly related in some way to the
form of some whistles that already existed in the set. Mirrored versions, combinations of existing whistles, repetitions
of the same pattern within a whistle or whistles with similar
shapes but different whistle manners for instance appeared.
Figure 3 shows an example from one of the chains in the
scrambled condition. Here, at generation four, two whistles
were in the set that followed approximately the same shape in
pitch contour (down and up), but were whistled in a different
manner. One of them was whistled in a smooth and unbroken
fashion and the other was more staccato-like and broken into
pieces. In generation five, one half of each of these whistles
is borrowed and reused to form a new whistle. The left part

Initial input sets
Two separate initial whistle sets were constructed. Each set
was used as the starting point for half of the chains in each
condition. The whistles were taken from a database of whistles that were collected during a pilot study. During this pilot,
people were asked to freely record a number of whistles. The
two initial sets were constructed so as not to exhibit combinatorial structure. To achieve this, the entropy measure for
quantifying combinatorial structure from Verhoef (2012) was
used. Sets of twelve whistles were generated randomly from
the database until two sets were found with no overlap, that
had a comparable and relatively high measured entropy.

whistle-object pairs after the first learning phase and with the
other half after the second. The whistles from the last recall phase were used as training input for the next participant,
depending on the condition either with intact or scrambled
whistle-object mappings. Transmission was continued from
person to person until there were eight generations in each
chain and four chains per condition.

Figure 4: Development of structure in a chain from the intact
condition. See main text for an explanation.
Figure 4 shows an example from one of the chains in the
intact condition. In this example one whistle from generation three seems to be the inspiration for two new whistles in
the next generation: one with one ‘bump’ and another with
two. In generation five the ‘two bump’ whistle is started to
be reused and combined with another pattern and in generation six both the one bump and two bump whistles are being
reused, mirrored and recombined more widely. An existing
whistle with several up and down movements is even segmented into two parts, where the first part is again the two
bump whistle.
To examine the final result of these gradual changes in the
chains, we can look at the set of whistles produced by the
eighth and last participant in a chain. Figure 5 shows a frag-

ment of such a set from the scrambled condition and here we
can identify a clear combinatorial structure. There is a set of
building blocks (short level notes, falling-rising slides, risingfalling slides, etc) and these are reused and combined in a systematic way to create the whistles in the set. For some of the
whistles, there is another version that is mirrored vertically
and a pattern of short notes of alternating pitch height seems
to be a recurring theme. The set has become constrained as
well, for instance in terms of the complexity of the fallingrising patterns and the overall variation in the type of building
blocks that are left.

When talking about mappings between whistle sounds and
objects one may wonder how a whistle sound can iconically
depict a visual object. This is difficult to identify as an outside observer, since iconicity is subjective and depends on
experience and individual history. However, some examples
could be found in the form-meaning pairs in the current data
and iconicity could take several different forms in these examples. Most often, the shape of the whistle, or the pitch
contour, would mimic certain features in the object. This
could for instance be the overall shape of the object, the orientation of the object or the amount of visually distinctive
parts on the object. It needs to be noted though that these
are subjective observations and that it is not necessarily the
case that the participants would be aware of these structural
similarities. Judging from the observations, iconic mappings
were not found to be widespread throughout the whole experiment. Figure 7 shows a few examples of clearly iconic
form-meaning mappings that were encountered.

As compared to the whistle experiment described in Verhoef
(2012), the emergence of discretization is not always the same
in the current study. In the previous experiment, the silences
(or pauses in the air stream) in the whistles were used as indicators for where one segment ended and another one began.
In the current study this appears not to be the only obvious
manner in which discretization can be observed. Here, we
also find structures that are combinatorial, but non-sequential
or sequential without silences. Figure 6 shows an example,
where the same whistle shape, or movement, is reused several times, but each time with some parts realized in a different whistle manner (broken or smooth). This observation
is taken into account in the quantitative analysis described in
the next section.

Figure 7: Examples of iconic whistle-object pairs in the data.
Participants filled out a post-participation questionnaire in
which they were asked to describe their specific strategy (if
any) for recall and whether they thought the whistles and objects fit well together. Often participants reported strategies
in line with the observations described in the previous paragraph. Other strategies that were reported involved: imagining how the object would sound and linking this with the
whistle, imagining how the object would move and linking
the pitch contour with that, or linking the object with some
real object they know and linking the whistle with the sound
that object would make. These reports further illustrate the
subjectivity of form-meaning resemblance.
In summary, the structures that emerged in the sets of whistled signals resemble the discrete and combinatorial structure
that emerged in the experiment without meanings (Verhoef et
al., 2011; Verhoef, 2012). Qualitatively, no difference could
be observed between the structures in the two conditions and
iconicity did not seem to play a large role.

Figure 6: A structure where recombination is not solely sequential.

This section describes a quantitative analysis to assess
whether the observed patterns are consistent across the data.
First, the learnability is investigated by computing how well
participants were able to recall the set of whistle-object pairs.

3672

Then, the development of combinatorial structure is measured.

Recall error
To find out whether the sets of whistle-object pairs became
easier to learn and reproduce, we measured how well participants were able to recall the right whistle for each of the objects. The recall error was measured by comparing each whistle that a participant produced for an object with the whistle
linked to that specific object in the input. To determine the
distance between two whistles, the same distance measure
was used as the one used by Verhoef (2012). This measure
compares plunger movement tracks (pitch tracks converted
to plunger displacement) with the use of derivative Dynamic
Time Warping (Keogh & Pazzani, 2001).
Figure 8 shows the data for this measure of recall error for
the four chains in both conditions, with increasing generations on the horizontal axis. The mean over the four chains
for each condition and standard error are plotted.
A linear mixed effects analysis was performed (with lme4
in R) to explore the effect of generation on the recall error, with an intercept for chain as random effect. Likelihood ratio tests of this model against a null model excluding the effect of generation revealed a significant trend affecting error (χ2 (7) = 14.08, p = 0.0498), decreasing it by about
0.18 ± 0.056 (standard errors) from generation to generation
for the intact condition, as well as for the scrambled condition (χ2 (7) = 27.25, p = 0.0003) with a decrease of about
0.1 ± 0.025 (standard errors). This suggests that there is an
increase in the reproducibility of the form-meaning pairs over
generations in both conditions.

blocks that are more widely reused and combined. One adjustment had to be made to the measure as it was described
in Verhoef (2012). Based on the qualitative observation that
there was clearly no one ‘right’ segmentation that could be
used to describe the discretization of the signal space, three
different types of segmentation were defined. The whistles
were segmented in all three ways and the entropy was computed for each of the three sets of basic building blocks that
resulted from the segmentations. The lowest entropy value
that was measured was then considered to be the best minimal description length approximation and was used as the
measure for (dis)order. The first type of segmentation used
silences as segment boundaries. The second type used the
minima and maxima in the plunger movement track as segment boundaries and the third used the points of minimal and
maximal velocity.
Figure 9 shows the development of entropy for the four
chains in both conditions, where 0 refers to the initial whistle
set. Again, the mean over the four chains and standard error
for each condition is plotted.
A linear mixed effects model was constructed in the same
way as for recall error, but with entropy as the test variable. A
significant trend (χ2 (7) = 19.73, p = 0.006) of decreasing entropy by about 0.69 ± 0.20 (standard errors) from generation
to generation for the intact condition was found, as well as
for the scrambled condition (χ2 (7) = 17.22, p = 0.016) with
a decrease of about 0.52 ± 0.19 (standard errors). These findings imply that the process of iterated learning in both conditions caused structure to emerge in the sets of whistles that
refer to meanings.

Combinatorial structure

Transparency

To investigate whether the sets of whistles gradually become
more structured over generations, the entropy measure that
was used by Verhoef (2012) was applied to the current data.
This measure makes use of the notion of entropy from information theory and is based on the idea that a set with more
combinatorial structure is composed of less basic building

Although it is difficult to assess the actual role iconicity
played in the two conditions, the results of the guessing game
phases could indirectly reveal a potential influence. If the
mappings were more transparent in the intact condition, we
would expect participants in that condition to score higher on
the identification task after only very little exposure to the

3673

data. A linear mixed effects analysis was performed to explore the effect of condition on the scores, with round number
(half of the items appeared in a guessing game round after the
first exposure to the data and the other half after the second
exposure) as fixed effect and intercepts for chain and generation as random effects. Likelihood ratio tests of this model
against a null model excluding the effect of condition showed
that condition does not affect performance in the guessing
game (χ2 (1) = 0.210, p = 0.647). This could suggest the role
of iconicity was minimal in both conditions, or at least did
not play a large enough role in the intact condition to boost
identification scores. However it needs mentioning that the
participants had been exposed to the data before the guessing
game phases, which is expected to have influenced the scores.

Discussion
The experiment presented in this article shows that cultural
evolution in the laboratory causes a system of whistled words
for novel objects to become more learnable and more structured over time. This work expands a previous finding that
showed the same result for whistled systems without meanings (Verhoef et al., 2011; Verhoef, 2012). For two different situations, one with transmission of intact form-meaning
pairs and one with scrambled pairs, we showed that the transmitted whistled systems develop from holistic towards having
discrete and combinatorial structure. Sets of building blocks
are efficiently reused and combined, similar to the structures
of speech. In addition to the data presented by Verhoef et
al. (2011), the current data forms another example to show
that the emergence of combinatorial structure is not necessarily driven by vocabulary expansion and dispersal as was
proposed by Hockett (1960).
As a secondary objective we explored the tension between
combinatorial structure and possible iconic mappings. It appeared that the potential for iconic mappings did not prevent the emergence of structure in this experiment. However,
when looking at the development of entropy in the two conditions, we can see that the main ‘drop’ in entropy in the intact
condition took place approximately from generation four to
eight, while in the scrambled condition, this was sooner, approximately from generation one to five. This could hint at
a slight delay in the emergence of combinatorial structure in
the intact condition, which would follow the expectation, but
the current data from the guessing game phase does not suggest a large influence of iconicity. A more detailed analysis is
needed. When we have a better picture of the actual development of iconicity, the development of structure can be linked
to it more directly. Finding an objective measure for quantifying iconicity in the data is not trivial however and this will
be part of our future continuation of this research.
To conclude, this article provides additional evidence to
show that combinatorial structure in language can emerge
through cultural evolution. The influence of iconicity in this
evolutionary process still needs to be investigated in more
depth, but with this study we provide an experimental plat-

form that can be used to tackle this issue. In the future, additional experiments are expected to lead to more insights.
