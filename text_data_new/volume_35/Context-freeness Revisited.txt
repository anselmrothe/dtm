Problems with the experimental record

Abstract
A series of papers have appeared investigating the ability of
various species to learn context-free languages. From a computational point of view, the experiments in this tradition suffer
from a number of problems concerning the stimuli used in the
training phase of the experiments, the controls presented in the
test phase of the experiments, and the motivation for and the
conclusions drawn from the experiments. This paper discusses
in some detail the problems with the existing work in this domain before presenting a new design for this type of experiments that avoids the problems identified in existing studies.
Finally, the paper presents results from a small study demonstrating the benefits of the new design.
Keywords: Context-free languages, formal language theory,
artificial language learning, animal experiments

Introduction
Since the publication of (Fitch & Hauser, 2004), a small but
highly visible literature has emerged investigating the ability of various species to learn and process a context-free
language (e.g., Friederici, 2004; Perruchet & Rey, 2004;
Gentner, Fenn, Margoliash, & Nusbaum, 2006; Hochmann,
Azadpour, & Mehler, 2008; van Heijningen, de Visser,
Zuidema, & ten Cate, 2009; Abe & Watanabe, 2011; ten Cate
& Okanoya, 2012). It is not difficult to see why the questions
addressed in this literature appeal to a wide audience: the
grammars generating context-free languages are context-free
by virtue of their ability to generate hierarchical structures
and to implement center-embedding. Hierarchy and centerembedding are, since (Chomsky, 1957), widely recognized
to be hallmark features of human language. Hence, experimentally establishing whether non-human animals can handle
a context-free language1 seems to address a prime candidate
in the search for uniquely human, and perhaps uniquely linguistic, cognitive skills.
However, on a closer look, there are many problems with
this literature, and almost a decade of investigation and debates have not brought the clarity about this issue that we
might have hoped for. In this paper I will first discuss in
some detail the problems with the existing work in this domain before presenting a new design for this type of experiments. I will present results of a small experiment with
this design, that show it is workable. For lack of space, I
will not review elementary formal language theory here; see
(O’Donnell, Hauser, & Fitch, 2005) for an introductory and
(Jäger & Rogers, 2012) for a more advanced discussion of the
formal background of the experiments discussed here.
1 Throughout this paper I will use the phrase “a context-free language” as denoting a member of the subset of the context-free languages that is not also in the set of regular languages.

From a computational point of view, the experimental record
suffers from a number of problems concerning the stimuli
used in the training phase of the experiments, the controls
presented in the test phase of the experiments, and the motivation for and the conclusions drawn from the experiments.
The first major problem is a lack of clarity about which
ability is really investigated: the ability to implement a
context-free language, the ability to learn a context-free language, or a preference for selecting a context-free strategy
from the set of strategies adequate for solving the task. Much
of the rhetoric seems to be about the ability to implement, but
all existing experiments that I am aware of really at best address the weaker hypothesis that non-human animals lack the
human preference.
This problem is exacerbated as all existing studies allow
a great deal of ambiguity in the training phase about which
strategies are adequate. Some ambiguity is unavoidable: all
real-world experiments can only present a subset of the infinite stringsets that make up context-free languages, leaving the learner fundamentally uncertain about whether or not
sub- or supersets of the intended context-free language are
the target (see figure 4). Moreover, studies using familiarization/habituation paradigms can only present positive stimuli
in the training phase. However, in a reinforcement paradigm
some ambiguity is avoidable, but existing studies using such
a paradigm fail to provide learners with the information that
some plausible alternatives are not intended. For instance,
(Gentner et al., 2006) presented their starlings with in the
order of 300000 stimuli with positive and negative feedback
to learn to distinguish An Bn from (AB)n , but not with a single stimulus that would help the birds exclude An Bm . If the
question we want to ask is whether these birds can learn the
context-free language at all, it would be better to avoid unnecessary ambiguity about the task (desideratum 1).
A second unclarity in existing work comes from unnecessary variation in the syllables of (song) elements used to
compose the stimuli. Thus, when testing whether subjects
can learn An Bn , all studies I am aware off use multiple instances of A’s and B’s. This means the subjects are really confronted with two tasks at the same time: the task to categorize
a1 , a2 , . . . as instances of class A, and the task to learn sequencing rules. While the interaction between categorization
and sequence learning is certainly interesting, this interaction
has in fact not been explicitly addressed in this paradigm. In
most studies the categorization task is made rather trivial because A’s and B’s are carefully selected to be acoustically very
similar within one category and very dissimilar between categories. In these studies the variation in stimuli probably has

1664

little impact on the results and just makes describing the experiments unnecessarily complicated; in other cases, it introduces confounds. It would be better, therefore, to avoid these
complications and start with experiments using an alphabet
with just 2 items: a and b (desideratum 2).
A third major problem with the existing literature concerns
inadequate controls (see also Beckers, Bolhuis, Okanoya, &
Berwick, 2012). (Fitch & Hauser, 2004) present no data on
controls for alternative strategies (although the supplementary material states – without presenting details – that various alternative explanations have been controlled for). Unlike many other experiments, (Gentner et al., 2006) did test
a number of these alternative strategies, and presented results
that seemed to exclude all except for the most “heavily contrived” finite-state grammar hypotheses. It turns out that even
their quite elaborate efforts to control for various alternative
strategies are insufficient, as I will discuss below. It would
seem necessary, therefore, to work out better ways to evaluate the plausibility of alternative explanations for the results
(desideratum 3).

itself is not enough to prove context-freeness, as Gentner et
al note. For instance, the two groups of birds could have internalized + FINITE - STATE -0 and - FINITE - STATE -0 instead3 .
I.e., they could do with a model for the finite-state stimuli
set, and only accept/reject stimuli that do not/do conform to
it. Or, because the string length is set to 4, An Bn is indistinguishable from A2 B2 (which, again, doesn’t need context-free
power to be recognized). Worse even: there are many other
alternative strategies to distinguish the training stimuli-sets,
the simplest of which are based on detecting specific elementto-element transitions, or memorizing the beginning or end of
strings. For instance, the BA transition, and the AB beginning,
are diagnostic, because they both only occur in the + FINITE STATE -0 set.
If one could show, in the test phase, that the birds have
learned a context-free language, this ambiguity in the training phase is not a problem. However, if the birds turn out to
choose one of the simpler strategies that also suffice to distinguish the two classes, we are left almost empty-handed. We
cannot make plausible, then, that birds cannot learn contextfree language, because we haven’t tried very hard to force
them to.

A case-study: Gentner et al. 2006
To make these problems concrete, I will here discuss them
in the context of (Gentner et al., 2006). This is not because
this paper has more methodological problems than others; on
the contrary, in fact, this paper probably represents one of
the most serious efforts to control for alternative explanations
among the experimental papers in this domain. As I will show
below, however, the results from this study have nevertheless
little to say about the ability or inability of song birds to learn
a context-free language.
Training Gentner et al. studied whether starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are able to learn a context-free language. As
in many other studies, the stimuli in this experiment were
strings of elements that fall into two easily distinguishable
categories, A and B, each with a small number of members,
i.e. A = {a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . , a8 } and B = {b1 , b2 , b3 , . . . , b8 }. Gentner et al. extracted these stimuli from the starling’s own
song, where the A’s were “rattle” motifs and the B’s were
“warble” motifs. Stimuli in the training phase consisted of
strings of length 4 from two patterns2 : (i) (AB)n and (ii)
An Bn . I will refer to string sets defined by these patterns as the
FINITE - STATE -0 and the CONTEXT- FREE language (the 0 indicating that this is just the first of many finite-state languages
that I will consider).
The birds were trained in a go-nogo operant conditioning
procedure to respond selectively to stimuli from one or the
other pattern. In the experiment, birds did indeed learn to distinguish the stimuli sets, at levels far exceeding chance, also
when new A- and B-category elements were used. This in
2I

use a conventional shorthand notation for sets of strings of a
given pattern, where A’s and B’s indicate any elements from these
classes, X n indicates n repetitions of X, and brackets are used to
disambiguate the scope.

Testing In the test phase, Gentner et al did consider a relevant set of alternative strategies.
The first test is whether subjects generalize from A2 B2 to
a larger subset of An Bn . Of course, in formal language theory the language An Bn contains an infinite number of strings,
where n can be any integer. Gentner et al. argue, quite reasonably, that in an experimental setting we should be concerned
about whether subjects generalize to unseen n. (This is completely analogous to the use of formal language theory in the
study of natural language: if we can demonstrate the right
generalization mechanisms on necessarily finite data, we can
reason about an infinite competence under a hypothetical lifting of performance constraints.) Gentner et al. report, for
birds trained with A2 B2 , a strong preference for A3 B3 and
A4 B4 strings over (AB)3 and (AB)4 respectively (and an inverse preference for birds trained on (AB)2 ). This rules out
the - FINITE - STATE -0 (or + FINITE - STATE -0) strategy.
There remain, however, still many alternative hypotheses that predict successful discrimination of An Bn and (AB)n
strings. It is useful to define the following simple, but effective strategies for positively responding to the + CONTEXTFREE stimuli4 :
+A N B N: An Bn , with n ≥ 1
+A N B M: A+ B+ , the set of strings that consist of 1 or more
A’s followed by 1 or more B’s;
- BIGRAM -BA: ·∗ BA·∗ , strings containing transition BA;
3 A strategy is defined by a PATTERN , written in smallcaps, and a
+ or a − in front of it; the + indicates that strings that conform to
the pattern are treated as positive stimuli; the − indicates that strings
that conform to the pattern are treated a negative stimuli.
4 I will use more or less standard regular expression notation,
where a dot · means any symbol, ∗ means repeated any number (≥ 0)
of times, and + means repeated any number (≥ 1) of times.

Table 1: Predicted response of various hypothesized pure strategies to probe stimuli. See the main text for descriptions of the
top 9 strategies; the bottom two strategies check the length of a string, and accept strings up to length 4 and 6 respectively.
+ BIGRAM -AA: ·∗ AA·∗ , strings containing transition AA;
+ BIGRAM -BB: ·∗ BB·∗ , strings containing transition BB;
- PRIMACY-AB: AB·∗ , the set of strings that start with AB;
+ PRIMACY-AA: AA·∗ , the set of strings that start with AA;
- RECENCY-AB: ·∗ AB, the set of strings that end with AB;
+ RECENCY-BB: ·∗ BB, the set of strings that end with BB;
Any of these strategies (together with their complements
when considering the birds that should NOT respond to An Bn )
suffices to distinguish positive from negative samples in the
experimental set-up (and all listed alternative strategies are
in the finite-state class). But these nine hypotheses do make
different predictions on the behavior of the subjects for previously unseen patterns. For instance, the + PRIMACY-AA
strategy classifies all of the + CONTEXT- FREE stimuli as positive, but in addition, for string length 4, also includes AAAA,
AAAB, AABA. Table 1 gives for (the + variety of) each of
these strategies the predicted response (1 is a GO-response, 0
is a NOGO-response).
There are, in fact, still many other alternative strategies
that we could consider, such as memorizing non-adjacent
pairs (e.g., A · B·∗ ), or requiring a specific number of a particular transition (e.g., requiring two AB transitions, as in
B∗ A+ B+ A+ B+ , or exactly one, as in A+ B+ A∗ ). Gentner et
al. appeal, quite reasonably again, to considerations of parsimony to ignore such alternatives.
To rule out the 9 remaining alternative explanations, Gentner et al. presented birds with a number of diagnostic strings.
For instance:
• AAAB, which is incorrectly predicted to give a positive
response by - FINITE - STATE -0, - BIGRAM -BA, + BIGRAM AA, and + PRIMACY-AA;
• BBBB, which is incorrectly predicted to give a positive
response by - FINITE - STATE -0, - BIGRAM -BA, + BIGRAM BB, - PRIMACY-AB, - RECENCY-AB and + RECENCY-BB.
In an experimental setup, however, checking these predictions needs to be buffered to unavoidable noise in the data.
(It would be unreasonable to reject an hypothesis based on a
single unexpected classification by a bird.) Hence, we need

to use statistics, but how statistical methods for data analysis are combined with formal language theory is a non-trivial
issue that both theoreticians and experimentalists have so far
largely ignored. (Even the review by (Jäger & Rogers, 2012),
which presents a major effort to bridge formal language theory and artificial language learning experiments, ignores this
issue).
Gentner et al. chose to use the d’-statistic, which is a measure for discrimination between stimuli classes that corrects
for response bias (the tendency to prefer a GO or a NOGOresponse regardless of the stimulus). They show that the d’
between AAAA and ABBA is significantly lower than the d’
between A2B2 and AB2, and argue this rules out the +AAPRIMACY strategy. Similarly, they find lower d’ for BBBB
vs BAAB, and for BAAB/ABBA vs. AAAA/BBBB, and argue this rules out +BB- RECENCY and -BA- BIGRAM. Similar analyses can be given for the remaining alternative strategies.
However, it turns out that this approach for ruling out alternatives is only valid if the population is homogeneous –
all members follow the same strategy – and if each individual
follows a pure strategy. If individuals or populations can mix
multiple strategies , Gentner et al.’s method leads to invalid
conclusions. The data of Gentner et al., reproduced as the
blue bars in figure 2, clearly show that the assumption of pure
strategies is false: the d’-statistic for the An Bn vs. ABn constrast decreases with increasing n, and the d 0 ’s for the primacy
and recency strategies differ significantly. A study on zebra
finches, by (van Heijningen et al., 2009), reported major individual differences between birds, further strengthening the
case against the pure strategy assumption.
Simulated Data To show how the d’-statistic can lead to
wrong conclusions, I will now present some artificial data
that shows a qualitatively similar pattern of d’-scores for both
a model that involves an underlying context-free grammar
(model I: CFG) and a model that is just a mix of finite-state
strategies (model II: MIX).
To generate the CFG data, I assume a population where
70% of the individuals have internalized the +ANBNstrategy, 10% follow a strategy to reject long strings

are the result of a single run of the model).
I subsequently calculate the d’-statistic in the same way as
(Gentner et al., 2006). This statistic is simply the difference
between the z-transform of the counts: d 0 (x, y) = z(x) − z(y)
where the z-transform in turn is a way to express the magnitude of the score in terms of how many standard deviations
it is away from the mean: z(x) = (d¯ − x)/σd where d is the
complete data vector from which x is one value (or the average of several values), and σd is the standard deviation over
that vector.
Applying these formulas to the contrasts between An Bn and
(AB)n for n ∈ {2, 3, 4} we obtain, in figure 2(left) qualitatively
similar results to Gentner et al: significant discrimination for
all, but a decrease in discriminability with increasing n. Although unsurprising, this result points to a problem with existing studies that fail to show generalization: this could be
due to length effects. It would be better if tests for generalization do not only test on longer strings in the test phase than
were offered in the training phase (desideratum 4).
Applying these formulas to the contrasts between AAAA
and ABBA (labeled “primacy” in (Gentner et al., 2006)),
BBBB vs BAAB (labeled “recency”), and BAAB/ABBA vs.
AAAA/BBBB (labeled “bigram B/A”) we observe, in figure 2(right) the exact same pattern of results as Gentner et al
reported: overall much lower d 0 -values than for the baseline,
with primacy receiving the second highest score and recency
the lowest.
Hence, for both the context-free (CFG) and mix of finitestate strategies (MIX) we see the same pattern of d 0 -values,
showing that when mixed strategies are possible, these values
are uninformative about whether or not a context-free language is learned by any individual in the population. Hence,
we need better tools to assess which strategies individuals are
using and whether there is significant individual variation in
a population (desideratum 5).

(+.{1, 6}), 10% reject medium and long strings (+.{1, 4}),
and 10% randomly choose GO or NOGO. This is equivalent
to assuming a mixed strategy with the same proportion, or a
combination of intra- and interindividual variation.
To generate the MIX data, I assume a mix of finite-state
strategies in the following proportions (roughly based on
the findings of (van Heijningen et al., 2009)): 25% +AAPRIMACY , 15% +BB- RECENCY , and 10% for each of the
other strategies in table 1 + RANDOM.
A given mix of strategies defines for each stimulus a specific number f of GO-responses, from a fixed number of 100
presentations. To generate some randomness, I assume each
of the f stimuli that should be classified as a GO-response
has a fixed probability p = 0.03 to receive a NOGO-response,
and similarly, that each of the 100 − f remaining stimuli have
a probability p of receiving a GO-response.
Hence, the final number of GO-responses is g = x + y,
where both x and y are sampled from a binomial distribution:

A new design
The problems I discussed with the Gentner et al. study are
symptomatic for many studies in this domain. Confusion

1667

about exact goals and methodology are of course typical for
the early phase of a new research field. It is now time,
however, for an experimental design to emerge that is both
methodologically sound and capable of generating useful results. In the following I will present an attempt to give such
a design and a first experiment to assess its usefulness. The
design follows desiderata 1-4 discussed above:
1. The goal of the design is to test whether or not the subjects
can learn the context-free language An Bn from the type of
data that can be used with animals as well as human infants
and adults; i.e., not too long strings, possibly with positive
and negative feedback. Some strings are reserved for the
test phase only, to assess generalization, but otherwise any
training regime is allowed within these constraints. In practice, I choose for a two-stage training phase: a familiarization phase where only positive stimuli are presented, and
a feedback phase where positive and negative stimuli are
presented with positive and negative feedback. The negative stimuli are not just from (AB)n , but also from other
plausible, but incorrect, alternative languages.
2. To make the task as simple and unambiguous as possible,
I define the patterns over an alphabet of just two different sounds: a and b, selected to be short and acoustically
clearly distinct.
3. To be able to test for generalization, I reserve 2 values of
n for strings from An Bn and An Bn for the test phase only.
I further reserve a number of n, m combinations for strings
in An Bm6=n for the test phase, to be able to exclude primacy,
recency and ANBM-strategies.
4. To make sure the test strings are not much longer than the
strings seen at training, I use n ∈ {2, 3, 5, 6} for An Bn and
(AB)n strings at training, and n ∈ {3, 4, 6, 7} at test.
The stimuli presented to subjects in the various phases are
thus as follows:
Phase
Familiarization
Feedback
Test

Stimuli
a2b2, a3b3, a5b5, a6b6
Positive: a2b2, a3b3, a5b5, a6b6
Negative: ab2, ab3, ab5, ab6, a3b2, a5b4
Positive: a3b3, a4b4, a6b6, a7b7
Negative: ab3, ab4, ab7, a3b2, a4b3, a2b3

Experimental data Ultimately we need a lot of data and
new analysis tools to meet desideratum 5 and exclude mixed
strategies between and within individuals. However, a first
important check on the design is to evaluate whether we can
replicate the findings (Hochmann et al., 2008) that humans
adults can, at the population level, (i) learn to distinguish
strings from An Bn from several finite-state alternatives, and
(ii) generalize to unseen n. We therefore carried out a small
experiment with the design above, to test whether its new features 1-4 stand in the way of successful learning.

The experiment was implemented as a simple internetbased applet. Subjects were instructed that they were going to do an experiment that looked a bit like a computer
game, where they would have learn an alien language. At
the computer screen, subjects were presented with written instructions, and, once they started the game, presented with a
space background and UFO’s moving over the screen. Subjects were asked to click on disks and listen to the sounds produced. After hearing the sounds they would decide to either
shoot the UFO or save the aliens inside. In the familiarization phase (4 exposures to each stimulus), they were told all
aliens were ’good aliens’ and shooting was disabled. In the
feedback phase (1 exposure to each stimulus) feedback was
provided in the form of happy or sad face on the screen. In
the test phase (2 exposures to each stimulus) no feedback was
given.
54 subjects were recruited in the Amsterdam Science Museum (Nemo) in August 2012, and volunteered for the experiment without payment. The experiment last only about 5
minutes per subject. Subject ages ranged from around 10 to
around 80; native languages included several major European
languages. We thus worked with a very heterogeneous group
of subjects and obtained very little data per person. Hence,
the experiment was not useful (nor intended) for settling the
question of whether human adults can learn a context-free
language in such a setup, but to assess whether the experimental design defined above is able to generate useful data.
Figure 3 (left) gives the overall response rates for each of
the stimuli presented in the test phase. As can be seen, the
response rates for the An Bn stimuli on the left are higher
than for the An Bn stimuli on the right, which in turn are
higher than the ABn stimuli in the middle. All three pairwise
between-group difference are highly significant (p < 0.01,
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Crucially, responses to a4b4 are
indistiguishable from other positive stimuli, indicating subjects have, at the population level, generalized to unseen n.
These data thus, roughly, replicate earlier results. But can
we check for all relevant alternative explanations, including
a mix of finite-state strategies, as I argued above would be
necessary? Unfortunately, with so little data per subject, we
cannot sensibly estimate individual strategies. To get some
idea about individual variation I split the data in two based
on performance during the feedback phase. 20 subjects were
classified as low-performers, with an accuracy in the feedback phase of less than 70% (similar to the criterion used in
van Heijningen et al., 2009). The other 34 subjects were classified as high-performers. Figure 3 (right) shows the d 0 statistic for the three pairwise contrasts. One striking value is a d 0
of approximately zero for the low performers on the An Bn vs.
An Bm contrast, showing that they did not distinguish between
the two classes and clearly had not learned a context-free language.
These data thus suggest that the experimental design presented above is very workable and can be used to obtain
useful data to address the question of whether subjects can

data per subject, we can apply the model selection approach
of (van Heijningen et al., 2009) to estimate the most likely
strategy for each individual subject.

Conclusions
I have discussed some major problems with existing studies attempting to show that nonhuman animals can or cannot
learn a context-free language. In that discussion, I identified
four desiderata for a new design of an experiment, and a fifth
desideratum for data analysis, to properly address that question. I have shown that these desiderata for the design can be
satisfied, and presented some experimental results that suggest there are no major obstacles to apply the new design in
animal experiments. I hope the interdisciplinary community
that tries to bring formal language theory, artificial language
learning and animal cognition experiments together will apply this new design in future experiments, such that the search
for uniquely human cognitive skills can be based on a more
sound foundation. I have not, in this paper, discussed the difficult question of whether context-freeness is really the most
important property to investigate in the search for a biological
basis for language (Zuidema, 2013). Even if it is not – and I
suspect it isn’t – it is essential that the methodological errors
in the experimental record on context-freeness get corrected.
Acknowledgments I thank Vanessa Ferdinand, Richard
Kunert and Sander Latour for their help in designing the experiment and creating the software for stimulus presentation
and data gathering, and the team at Nemo for running the experiment.
