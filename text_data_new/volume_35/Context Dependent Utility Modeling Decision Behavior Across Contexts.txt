Abstract
One significant challenge in creating accurate models of human decision behavior is accounting for the effect of context. Research shows that seemingly minor changes in the
presentation of a decision can lead to drastic shifts in behavior; phenomena collectively referred to as framing effects. Previous work has developed Context Dependent Utility (CDU), a framework integrating Appraisal Theory with
decision-theoretic principles. This work extends existing research by presenting a study exploring the behavioral predictions offered by CDU regarding the multidimensional effect of
context on decision behavior.
The present study finds support for the predictions of CDU regarding the impact of context on decisions: 1) as perceptions
of pleasantness increase, decision behavior tends towards riskaversion; 2) as perceptions of goal-congruence increase, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 3) as perceptions of
controllability increase, i.e., perceptions that outcomes would
have been primarily caused by the decision maker, behavior
tends towards risk-seeking.

Introduction
Descriptive models of human decision behavior seek to accurately describe and predict the decisions people actually
make. Creating these models is vital for advancing a more
complete understanding of the human decision process and
requires addressing the factors that systematically bias the
perception and evaluation of decisions.
One significant challenge in creating accurate models of
human behavior is accounting for the effect of context on decision behavior. Research has shown that seemingly minor
changes in the presentation, or framing, of a decision problem can lead to drastic shifts in behavior; phenomena collectively referred to as framing effects. In a seminal study, now
referred to as the Asian Disease Study, Tversky and Kahneman (1981) showed that when outcomes were described, or
framed, as gains participants tended to be risk-averse; however, when the same outcomes were framed as losses participants tended to be risk-seeking. Subsequent studies involving domains as diverse as financial planning (Schoorman,
Mayer, Douglas, & Hetrick, 1994), Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (Levin & Chapman, 1990), Breast
Self Examinations (Meyerowitz & Chaiken, 1987), taxpayer
compliance (Liu, Xia, & Xu, 2011), and judgments of website
quality (Hartmann, De Angeli, & Sutcliffe, 2008) have also
demonstrated framing effects to varying degrees. In addition to gain-loss framing, framing can also involve the role of
the decision maker (Wagenaar, Keren, & Lichtenstein, 1988),
the salience of outcomes (Van Schie & Van Der Pligt, 1995),

decision domain (Vartanian, Mandel, & Duncan, 2011), and
perceived need (Mishra & Fiddick, 2012).
Despite the highly multidimensional nature of context, the
prevalence of framing effects in numerous domains, and the
profound impact they can have on the decision process, very
few decision models explicitly address the multidimensional
impact of context on decisions. Existing decision-theoretic
approaches which do address framing and context are generally limited by a narrow, one-dimensional view of context. For instance, Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky,
1979) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) model the effect of context only to the extent
that it applies to outcomes perceived as either gains or losses.
Therefore, to address the multidimensional effect of context
on decision behavior, previous work has developed Context
Dependent Utility (CDU), a framework which seeks to explicitly model the multidimensional impact of context on decision behavior through the integration of Appraisal Theory
and decision-theoretic models (Ito & Marsella, 2011). This
work extends previous research by presenting an experimental study exploring the behavioral predictions offered by CDU
regarding the multidimensional effect of context on decision
behavior. In particular, the results support the behavioral predictions of CDU and suggest that it can dramatically improve
the modeling of human decision behavior across distinct contexts.

Context Dependent Utility
In previous work, Context Dependent Utility (CDU) was developed to explicitly model the multidimensional impact of
context on decision behavior (Ito & Marsella, 2011). The
CDU process consists of two primary components: the computational appraisal of the decision situation and an evaluation function aggregating the appraisal information into a
real-valued utility.
Appraisal Theory (Lazarus, 1991) is a psychological theory which addresses the process by which emotions arise
given the subjective evaluation and interpretation of a situation. Because appraisal theory provides a well-defined framework for the interpretation of features of a situation in terms
of their significance, we argue that it provides the means to
identify, encode, and integrate contextual information into the
decision process. Appraisal as implemented by CDU consists of three distinct evaluations: pleasantness, goal congruence, and control. Each appraisal is defined over individual
outcomes as a function of diminishing sensitivity evaluated
with respect to some reference point. This follows from the

2620

principle that emotions and appraisals arise primarily from
the changes, relative to some reference point, associated with
them rather than from any inherent properties of the outcomes
themselves (Frijda, 2007). The general appraisal function is
shown in (1), in which 0 ≤ k ≤ 1, controls the sensitivity of
the appraisal.
Pleasantness is implemented as an evaluation of value
made with respect to the value of the status quo, vsq , as in (2).
Goal congruence is implemented as an evaluation of value
made with respect to the value of the aspiration outcome, vao ,
as in (3). Control is a measure of the degree to which an outcome will be perceived to have been primarily caused by the
decision maker and is implemented as an evaluation of decumulative probability, i.e., the total probability of obtaining
an outcome at least as preferred as it, made with respect to
the probability of the control threshold, pct , as in (4). Note
that the decumulative probability representation given in (5)
requires that outcomes are in ascending order of value, i.e.,
vi ≤ vi+1 .

(x − re f )k if x − re f ≥ 0

Hypothesis 2 As outcomes are perceived as increasingly
goal-congruent, behavior will tend towards risk-aversion
Hypothesis 3 As outcomes are perceived as increasingly
controllable, behavior will tend towards risk-seeking
This work presents the results of an experimental framing
study designed to test the hypotheses offered by the CDU
framework. The study presents participants with a scenario
in which they are asked to decide between two competing
plans to prevent school dropouts.

The decision evaluation component of CDU is implemented using rank-dependent utility (Quiggin, 1982) as seen
in (6). Rank-dependent utility models allow for nonlinear decision weights while maintaining stochastic dominance. The
utility function consists of a linearly weighted combination
of pleasantness and goal congruence as seen in (7). Outcome
weight, πi , is defined in the standard rank-dependent manner
as seen in (8) and (9) in which a and b serve to normalize the
weighting function such that w (0) = 0 and w (1) = 1.

cording to the principles of the rank-dependent utility formalization employed in CDU, a concave utility function is
associated with risk-aversion whereas a concave weighting
function is associated with risk-seeking. Therefore, CDU offers the following set of behavioral predictions regarding the
effects of pleasantness, goal congruence, and control on the
decision process:

For the study, 525 participants from the United States were
recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Each participant received a payment of $0.40 for participation. The sample had a self-reported gender distribution
of 319 male (61%) and 206 female (39%). The median age
range was 22 to 34 years with 85% of participants below 45
years of age. The majority of participants self-identified as
white (78%). Approximately half of participants (50%) have
also completed a 2 year college degree or higher.
Risk propensity, measured using the Subjective Risk Assessment instrument (Dohmen et al., 2005), uses a 7-point
scale in which 1 represents being very prepared to take risks,
4 represents being risk-neutral, and 7 represents very unwilling to take risks. The mean of the subjective risk assessment
measure for all participants was 3.46 with a median value of
3 and a standard deviation of 1.4 representing a slight overall
self-reported tendency towards risk taking.
Additionally, only 42 participants (8%) self-identified as
possessing some real-life expertise involving the prevention
of school dropouts.

Procedure and Design
(8)
(9)

Since appraisals are implemented as functions of diminishing sensitivity with respect to reference points, the underlying
utility function becomes increasingly concave as perceptions
of pleasantness and goal-congruence increase. Similarly, the
underlying weighting function becomes increasingly concave
as perceptions of controllability increase. Furthermore, ac-

The study was administered as an anonymous online questionnaire implemented via Qualtrics (Qualtrics Labs Inc.,
Provo, UT). Before presentation of the decision scenario, demographic information including gender, age, race/ethnicity,
and highest level of education was collected along with a
measure of subjective risk propensity. Instructions adapted
from previous studies administered by Schneider (1992) were
then presented to participants regarding the upcoming decision task. In addition, an embedded Instructional Manipulation Check originally developed by Oppenheimer, Meyvis,

2621

and Davidenko (2009) was adapted and employed in the
present study to ensure that the instructions were read and
to encourage participant attentiveness.
The decision scenario was then presented to the participants. The scenario was based on one originally designed
by Fagley, Miller, and Jones (1999) to test standard gainloss framing, but subsequently expanded in the present study
to include additional considerations of context. It presented participants with two possible plans to prevent school
dropouts: one plan always results in some students dropping
out whereas the other plan results in either all students dropping out or no students dropping out. According to decisiontheoretic formalizations of risk, a preference for the plan
which always results in the same outcome (some students
dropping out) is characterized as a preference towards riskaversion whereas preference for the plan which results in one
of two potential outcomes (one good and one bad) is characterized as a preference towards risk-seeking. As in most framing studies, regardless of frame, the underlying values, i.e.,
numbers of students dropping out or staying in school and
outcome occurrence probabilities, associated with the scenario remain unchanged.
The framing of each scenario involved the explicit manipulation of the context associated with the appraisal dimensions
of pleasantness, goal congruence, and control. The manipulation of pleasantness was associated with the description of
outcomes as gains or losses such that outcomes described as
losses were presumed to be relatively unpleasant whereas outcomes described as gains were relatively pleasant. Therefore,
in the loss condition, outcomes were described by the number of students that drop out of school; for the gain condition,
outcomes were described by the number of students that stay
in school; for the neutral condition, outcomes were described
using both the number of students that drop out and stay in
school.
The manipulation of goal congruence was based on a previous study conducted by Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum (1981)
and involved specifying different evaluation criteria to establish what constitutes a successful, or goal-congruent, outcome. In particular, participants were informed that their
performance would be evaluated in comparison to the average retention rate, i.e., the percentage of students that stay in
school, of other schools in the district. Therefore, in the low
retention condition the expected retention rate was 5% (50
students stay in school or 950 drop out); in the neutral retention condition the retention rate was 40% (400 students stay
in school or 600 drop out); and in the high retention condition
the expected rate was 75% (750 students stay in school or 250
drop out).
The manipulation of control, derived from research on loci
of control (Rotter, 1966), involved depicting the source of uncertainty as either arising from chance events or from the ability of the decision maker. Uncertainty arising from chance
events suggests that outcomes are uncontrollable and therefore not caused by the decision maker whereas uncertainty

regarding the ability of the decision maker suggests that outcomes are controllable and will be perceived as having been
caused by the decision maker. Therefore, in the chance condition, uncertainty was depicted as arising from the random
selection, i.e., lottery, of funding applications; In the ability
condition, the source of uncertainty was described as arising from the hypothetical ability of the participant to write a
persuasive funding application; and the neutral condition involved a mixture of the two. A full listing of a school dropout
scenario in which outcomes are described as gains, retention
rate is low, and the source of uncertainty is depicted as arising
from one’s ability is given in Appendix .
The primary dependent variables in the decision task consisted of both a dichotomous choice between plans, as found
in most standard framing studies, and a continuous strengthof-preference response, which included an option indicating
indifference, as advocated by Levin, Gaeth, Schreiber, and
Lauriola (2002).
After completion of the decision task, participants were
asked to directly evaluate the pleasantness, goal congruence,
and control of the three potential outcomes, i.e., the sure outcome of the risk-averse alternative and the two potential outcomes of the risky alternative. This served as a manipulation
check to ensure that the contextual manipulations employed
in the scenario were effective. Participants were then offered
the opportunity to express any additional factors that may
have influenced their decisions. Finally, participants were
asked to indicate whether or not they perceived themselves as
possessing any type of expertise relating to school dropouts.
The study was conducted as a 3x3x3 between-subjects factorial in which both the presentation order of the two dropout
prevention plans and the ordering of the two potential outcomes of the risky alternative were balanced. Table 1 illustrates the various factors and the number of participants
that were assigned to each combination of factors. To ensure the integrity of the data, responses deemed inconsistent
by an automated consistency-verification program were ignored. An inconsistent response was defined as one in which
the dichotomous response regarding participant preference
between plans does not agree with the associated continuous strength-of-preference measure. For example, a stated
dichotomous preference for the sure alternative coupled with
a strength-of-preference score favoring the risky alternative
was deemed inconsistent.

Results
As discussed earlier, two distinct but related dependent measures were assessed: a dichotomous choice between alternatives and a continuous strength-of-preference measure. According to the dichotomous measure, 327 participants (62%)
preferred the sure alternative while 198 participants preferred the risky alternative (38%). Similarly, according to
the strength-of-preference measure, in which 1 indicates very
strong preference for the sure alternative, 4 indicates indifference, and 7 indicates very strong preference for the risky
alternative, mean choice preference was 3.61 with a median

The goals of the study were to examine how different aspects
of context affect decision behavior and whether shifts in preference in response to contextual changes, i.e., framing effects,
are consistent with the predictions offered by CDU.
The experimental results support both the multidimensional effect of context on decision behavior and the predictions offered by CDU with respect to the effects of context. In
particular, the present study finds strong support that the contextual dimensions associated with pleasantness, goal congruence, and control do affect decision behavior in the direction
predicted by CDU. CDU predicts that when outcomes are described as gains opposed to losses, decision makers will tend
to act in a more risk-averse manner to maintain pleasantness.
CDU also predicts that when the standards for success, i.e.,

retention rates, are low, decision makers tend to act in a more
risk-averse manner to maintain goal congruency compared to
when standards of success are high. Finally, CDU predicts
that when the source of outcome uncertainty is depicted as
arising from ability, e.g., persuasive writing ability, decision
makers tend to act in a more risk-seeking fashion to capitalize on the perceived controllability of the situation compared
to when the source of uncertainty is depicted as arising from
chance events.

Conclusion
One significant challenge in creating accurate, descriptive
models of human behavior is accounting for the effect of
context on decision behavior. Existing approaches at modeling context and its effects on decision behavior, i.e, framing
effects, are generally limited by a one-dimensional view of
contextual influence and therefore lack the descriptive flexibility to account for a broad range of behavior. Therefore,
this work extends previous research (Ito & Marsella, 2011)
on Context Dependent Utility (CDU), a decision framework
which seeks to explicitly model the multidimensional impact
of context on decision behavior, by presenting experimental
data supporting the need for accurate, multidimensional models of contextual influence on decision behavior. In particular,
this work presents the results of a study in which participants
are asked to choose between two alternative plans (one risky
and one risk-averse) to prevent school dropouts. Additionally,
to examine the effect of context on overall decision behavior,
the context of the decision task is varied between subjects
along the following dimensions: whether outcomes are described in terms of gains or losses; the retention rate used to
determine the degree to which an outcome is considered successful; and the portrayal of the source of uncertainty in the
scenario, i.e., whether outcome variability depends on chance

or ability-based factors.
The present study shows strong support for all of the behavioral predictions offered by CDU regarding the impact of
context on decision behavior: 1) as the overall perception of
pleasantness increases, which is associated with the description of outcomes as gains rather than losses, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 2) as the overall perception
of goal-congruence increases, which is associated with lower
retention rates implying lower standards of success, decision
behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 3) as the overall perception of controllability, i.e., the perception that outcomes
would have been primarily caused by the decision maker, increases, which is associated with depicting the source of uncertainty as arising from one’s ability, behavior tends towards
risk-seeking. In sum, the present study illustrates the need
for models which explicitly represent the multidimensional
affect of context on behavior, such as CDU, especially when
modeling decision behavior across contextually distinct situations.

School Dropout Scenario

is projected that 1000 students in your district will drop out
of school during the next year if nothing is done.

Action Description
Two plans exist to address the student dropout problem. Both
plans require similar investments of money, time, and effort
from your district. However, only one can be implemented.
Based on other districts’ experiences with these plans, estimates of the outcomes that can be expected from each plan
can be made. Assume for purposes of this decision that these
estimates of are accurate and are as follows:
Dropout Prevention Plan A Invest currently available
funding in a smaller, relatively affordable dropout prevention program. This plan results in the following
outcome:
• 400 of the 1000 students stay in school
Dropout Prevention Plan B Invest currently available funding in a larger dropout prevention program. However, the
school district’s current funding is insufficient to cover the
full cost of this program. Therefore, its success is dependent on obtaining additional funding from the government.
Funding approval for your dropout plan depends primarily
on your ability to write a persuasive funding application.
Historically, 2/5 of your previous applications have been
persuasive enough to receive funding. This plan results in
one of two possible outcomes:
• 2/5 chance that you are able to write a persuasive funding application. This results in sufficient funding and
1000 of the 1000 students staying in school
• 3/5 chance that you are not able to write a persuasive
funding application. This results in insufficient funding
and 0 of the 1000 students staying in school

Evaluation Criteria
The standard used to evaluate your performance will be the
average student retention rate (the percentage of students that
stay in school) obtained by other school districts in the state.
Last year, the average retention rate for the other districts in
the state was 5%. The same rate is expected this year.
If you select a dropout prevention program that ultimately
leads to a higher retention rate than those obtained by other
districts in the state, you will be evaluated as being successful. Of course, the higher the retention rate is in your district,
the more successful you will be evaluated. On the other hand,
if you select a dropout prevention plan that ultimately leads to
a lower retention rate than the average rate of other districts,
your own evaluation will be diminished. Again, the more retention rates are below the average level, the more diminished
will be your own evaluation.
Which plan would you adopt?

Initial Scenario Presentation
Imagine that you have been hired by the school district of a
major city to combat the high number of student dropouts. It
