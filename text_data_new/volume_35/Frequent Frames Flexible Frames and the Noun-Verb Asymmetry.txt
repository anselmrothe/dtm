Abstract

terms of the grammatical category of the items that occur
in the central position. The notion of a frequent frame is
therefore thought to provide a powerful cue that children
might employ in the acquisition of syntactic categories.
More recent work has confirmed the utility of frequent
frames for French (Chemla et al. 2009), but results have
been less promising for languages with relatively free
word order such as Dutch (Erkelens, 2009) and German
(Stumper et al. 2011).
A major difference between the approaches of
Redington et al. and Mintz is that the approach described
by Redington is inherently graded and frequency sensitive
in nature. Thus, in this approach, co-occurrence statistics
are collected across all uses of a particular word.
Depending on the exact implementation, the approach can
also show varying degrees of frequency sensitivity with
context vectors containing (rank orders of) word counts.
Similarity is then expressed as a correlation-like measure
across context vectors, which can be interpreted as a
probability of two items being of the same class. This
graded context-sensitivity is absent from Mintz’s
approach. Thus, while Mintz’s analysis is restricted to the
45 most frequent frames, it clusters together all items that
co-occur in one of these frames. The approach therefore
ignores many contexts in which a word may occur, and
instead clusters items on the basis of (potentially one)
occurrence in specific high frequency contexts.
Typically, mechanisms for extracting grammatical
categories are evaluated in terms of accuracy (the extent
to which items that are clustered together belong to the
same syntactic category) and completeness (the extent to
all items within one syntactic category are clustered
together). St. Clair et al. (2010), as well as Monaghan
(2004), compared frames and independent contexts as
used by Redington et al. in the context of connectionist
simulations, and found that frames were accurate but
resulted in low completeness while independent contexts
performed similarly in terms of accuracy but
outperformed frames in terms of completeness.
However, while high accuracy is clearly a desirable
property of a mechanism that derives syntactic categories
(children for instance make very few word class errors), it
is less clear if high completeness is desirable, particularly
if one is interested in modeling children’s early linguistic
abilities. Thus, while children ultimately develop

In this paper we compare several mechanisms for using
distributional statistics to derive word class information.
We contrast three different ways of computing statistics for
independent left and right neighbours with the notion of a
frequent frame. We also investigate the role of utterance
boundaries as context items and weighting of frequency
information in terms of the successful simulation of the
noun-verb asymmetry. It is argued that independent
contexts can classify items with a higher degree of
accuracy than frequent frames, a finding that is more
pronounced for larger input sets. Frequent frames classify a
larger number of items, but do so with lower accuracy.
Utterance boundaries are useful for the development of a
noun category, particularly at intermediate levels of
frequency sensitivity.

Introduction
Several authors have shown that distributional statistics
can provide powerful cues for acquiring syntactic
categories; words that belong to the same syntactic
category tend to be preceded and followed by the same
words. Thus, nouns tend to be preceded by determiners
and adjectives and followed by verbs. Redington, Chater
and Finch (1998), building on work by Chater and Finch
(1992), investigate several variants of the same basic
principle: for any of a set of target words, a context vector
was derived that contained (rank orders of) counts of the
150 most frequent words in the corpus, in positions
preceding and following the target words. Redington et al.
computed correlations between the context vectors of the
target words, which were then used as input to a
Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, and concluded that the
resulting classes mapped closely onto broad syntactic
classes. Redington et al. explore a number of variants of
the basic mechanism, but get their best results by using a
context of one preceding and one following word, and
using a rank order correlation as their distance measure.
An alternative mechanism for acquiring syntactic
categories has been proposed by Mintz (2003). Mintz
introduces the notion of a frequent ‘frame’: two lexical
items with one word intervening (e.g. He X to). Mintz
argues that the (45) most frequent frames in the (English)
corpora he analyses show high internal consistency in

2327

linguistic abilities that suggest the presence of relatively
abstract linguistic categories, their early multi-word
speech has been characterized as lexically specific.
Moreover, completeness is often measured across word
classes, when there appear to be developmental
discontinuities in children’s productive use of
grammatical categories. Thus, children appear to be more
prepared to produce novel nouns than novel verbs in
familiar contexts (Akhtar & Tomasello, 1997), a finding
which has led to the suggestion that children may develop
a productive noun category earlier than a productive verb
category (Tomasello, 2000).
On the basis of these considerations, it would seem that
a mechanism that is plausibly employed by language
learning children is one that favours accuracy over
completeness and favours the linking of high numbers of
nouns over the linking of high numbers of verbs. One
factor that might impact on the relative likelihood of
linking nouns and verbs is the weighting of frequency
information. Nouns for instance have a relatively high
likelihood of being preceded by one of a small set of
determiners. A second factor that is likely to affect the
relative linking of nouns and verbs is the availability of
utterance boundaries as framing elements. Nouns have a
relatively high likelihood of occurring in utterance final
position, and the utterance boundary is thus a potentially
powerful cue for a noun category. Freudenthal et al.
(2008), in the context of connectionist simulations,
provide some evidence in support of this suggestion.
The main aims of this paper then are as follows: 1. To
compare frequent frames and measures similar to those
used by Redington et al. (1998) in terms of their ability to
simulate the word classes apparent in children’s early
speech, 2. To investigate how different levels of
frequency sensitivity as well as the availability of
utterance boundaries may impact on these mechanisms.

and 3. Cosine similarity based on the square root of
frequency counts. These three different measures differ
with respect to the weighting of frequency information,
which is highest for cosine similarity based on raw counts
and lowest for rank orders. Weighting of frequency
information is even lower for frequent frames: this
measure only considers whether or not target words cooccur within a given frame, not how often they co-occur.

Corpora
The analyses were performed on the child-directed speech
of the 12 children in the Manchester corpus (Theakston et
al., 2001). The child-directed speech in the Manchester
corpus is typically in the range of 25,000 to 30,000
utterances per child. Corpora were cleaned up minimally,
and only multi-word utterances were analysed. For all
corpora the following statistics were collected: for every
word in the corpus, counts were collected for the items
that preceded and followed it, as well as the frames (A X
B) that surrounded them. Frame counts were then tallied
across words to determine overall counts for (frequent)
frames.
One additional manipulation involved the merging of
the corpora for the 12 individual children into one large
corpus. This manipulation was included to determine
whether the mechanisms under investigation are
differentially affected by changes in corpus size.
For the purpose of determining accuracy of derived
word pairings, words were assigned their respective Part
of Speech (POS) tag as employed on the %mor coding
tier of the corpus. POS tags in the Manchester corpus are
relatively detailed and distinguish between main verbs
and auxiliaries, as well as nouns, pronouns and proper
nouns. The categories employed here are therefore similar
to what Mintz terms ‘expanded’ labelling. Where multiple
POS tags were used for one word form (e.g. forms that
can be used as either noun or verb) the most frequently
used POS tag was assigned. That is: words forms were
assigned to the grammatical category in which they were
used most frequently.

Similarity measures used
In the current paper we compare 4 different measures of
similarity. We consider the frequent frames approach
described by Mintz (2003), as well as 3 different
implementations of the independent contexts approach
described by Redington et al. (1998). In line with
Redington et al., we considered as target words (i.e.
words to be classified) the 1000 most frequent words in
the corpus. The frequent frames approach closely
followed the implementation by Mintz: we considered the
target words that co-occurred in the 45 most frequent
lexical frames within a corpus. The implementations of
independent contexts closely followed the implementation
of Redington et al. The context for a given word was
encoded as a vector of length 300 consisting of counts of
the 150 most frequent words in the corpus in the position
directly preceding and following the target word. The
actual similarity measures based on these vectors were: 1.
Spearman rank order correlation (as used by Redington et
al); 2. Cosine similarity based on raw frequency counts;

Results
There are several ways in which one can evaluate the
success of different similarity measures. Redington et al.
(1998) performed a cluster analysis, and plotted accuracy
and completeness as a function of the similarity level (or
number of clusters extracted). While this is informative, it
does raise a number of problems in interpreting the
outcome. First, it is not immediately obvious at what
similarity level one should compare different
mechanisms, and second, the clustering process itself can
be performed in different ways which have the potential
to influence the results in terms of accuracy and
completeness. For these reasons we opted to sidestep the
clustering process, and perform a more direct evaluation
of the similarity scores. This was done by extracting all
possible word pairs, and computing the relevant similarity

metrics for every word pair. Where a similarity metric
exceeded a certain threshold the word pair was considered
to belong to the same category.
This procedure obviously raises the question of what
threshold should be chosen for the different similarity
metrics. Generally, higher values for the threshold will
result in higher levels of accuracy and lower numbers of
classified items, but these numbers may differ across
metrics for a specific value of the threshold. For this
reason, we decided to choose a different value for the
threshold across metrics such that the resulting accuracy
was always relatively high (~ 90%) and comparable
across the metrics1, thus allowing for a meaningful
interpretation of differences in completeness. Table 1
shows percentage accuracy as well as number of
classified items for the 12 individual children in the
Manchester corpus, the average for these children as well
as scores for the merged Manchester corpus.
The concept of a threshold for classification is
irrelevant for frequent frames (thus making it impossible
to peg accuracy at 90%), as the notion of a frame entails
that two items that co-occur in one of the frequent frames
are of the same word class. Table 1 therefore lists
accuracy and number of classified items for all word pairs
that co-occurred in one of the 45 most frequent frames in

the relevant corpus. Word pairs that co-occurred in
multiple frames were counted only once.
Looking at the individual children and their average in
Table 1, it is obvious that there are substantial differences
between the different metrics. Frequent frames classify a
large number of pairs, but do so at relatively low
accuracy. Accuracy levels for frequent frames are lower
than reported by Mintz (who reports a type accuracy of
.91). This lower accuracy is at least partly caused by the
fact that, for the current analyses, words were assigned to
their most common category. While such a procedure
makes sense for graded measures that collate statistics
over different contexts, it may be less appropriate for the
frame style analysis. Thus several words can be used as
either a noun or a verb (e.g. pull, paint). In the corpora
employed here, pull is overwhelmingly used as a verb,
while paint is used as a noun more often than a verb (and
as a consequence, is considered to belong to the noun
class for the current analyses). The frequent frames
analysis will classify these items together (resulting in a
false alarm) because they co-occur in the frame you X
your.
For this reason we performed a second, contextual
accuracy analysis on the frames analysis: for every word
pair that co-occurred in one of the frequent frames, we
considered the actual category of the word within the
(most frequent) frame. This analysis resulted in accuracy
scores (.76 on average) that were higher than in the
standard analysis, but still lower than those attained by the
probabilistic measures.
A comparison of the probabilistic measures also reveals
differences. Spearman rank-order and square root cosine
similarity classify a similar number of items at similar
levels of accuracy. Raw cosine similarity on the other

The actual threshold levels were chosen to result in accuracy
levels close to 90% on the basis of a pilot study and were set at
.95 for raw cosine similarity, .70 for sqrt cosine similarity, and
.50 for rank order correlation. The same thresholds were used
throughout the analyses reported in this paper. Pilot work
furthermore suggested that the accuracy of the different
measures was similarly affected by proportional threshold
variations.

hand only classifies around a third of the number of items
that the other probabilistic measures classify.
Looking at the results for the merged corpus, it
becomes apparent that all four measures classify a larger
number of items. The three probabilistic measures
however, do so with slightly higher accuracy than for the
individual children, while the frequent frames measure
shows a decrease in accuracy (66% vs. 55%, and 76% vs.
69% for the contextual score). Thus, it appears that the
merged corpus contains additional information that can be
successfully employed by the probabilistic measures but
not the frequent frames measure. The increased
information in the merged corpus is actually detrimental
to the accuracy score for frequent frames. This latter
finding appears to be caused by the fact that the frequent
frames approach is overly sensitive to the occurrence of
‘stray’ words within the frequent frames. The fact that a
word needs to occur only once within a specific frame to
be clustered with all other words within that frame means
that infrequent words that are atypical of a particular
frame can potentially exert undue influence on overall
accuracy scores. This problem becomes more pronounced
in larger corpora. Such effects are less of a problem for
the probabilistic measures.

The noun-verb asymmetry
It was argued earlier that children are more willing to use
novel nouns in known contexts than they are to use verbs.
This finding has been taken as evidence that children
develop a productive noun category earlier than they
develop a verb category. In this section, we examine to
what extent the different metrics show a preference for
the clustering of nouns and verbs. This was done by
examining the ‘hits’ from the data in Table 1, and
counting the number of noun-noun and verb-verb pairs.
The resulting data (proportion of noun-noun pairs relative
to noun-noun + verb-verb pairs) are displayed in Table 2.
It is clear from Table 2 that the measures that are most
frequency sensitive cluster the highest proportion of
nouns. Thus, cosine similarity based on raw frequencies
clusters a relatively low number of items but these items
consist almost exclusively of nouns. Square Root Cosine
similarity and rank order correlation are equally
productive in terms of the number of items they classify,
with the more frequency sensitive Cosine Similarity
linking more nouns. Frequent frames on the other hand
overwhelmingly link verbs. It is also apparent from Table
2 that, for frames, there is considerable variation in the
proportion of noun-noun pairings: Aran’s proportion is
highest at 55%, but half the children show a proportion of
noun-noun pairings under 5%.

The role of utterance boundaries
The analyses reported in Table 1 and 2 only considered
‘lexical contexts’. That is, only words were considered as
context items. The following set of analyses included the
beginnings and ends of utterances as context items.
Redington et al. (1998) do consider utterance boundaries
as context items in one of their analyses (and conclude
that they are potentially useful), but the non-parametric
nature of their distance metric (rank order correlations)
may underestimate the potential utility of utterance
boundaries.
Mintz (2003) does not consider utterance boundaries,
and it could be argued that there is little reason to
consider them. Intuitively, the appealing feature of frames
is that (because of their lexical nature) they are highly
constraining and hence likely to result in relatively high
accuracy. Allowing utterance boundaries in frames limits
their constraining nature and may thus reduce accuracy
levels. At the same time, however, frames including

2330

utterance boundaries have the potential to capture large
numbers of nouns (e.g. The X end$) and thus might serve
to counteract the verb bias apparent in Table 2. Table 3
shows the accuracy scores and number of word pairings
for the analysis that include the utterance boundary as a
framing element. The proportion of noun-noun pairings
relative to noun-noun plus verb-verb pairings are shown
in Table 4. For reasons of brevity, Tables 3 and 4 do not
present data for the individual children in the Manchester
corpus, but only the average and merged data across the
12 children.

The analyses presented here suggest that independent
contexts result in better predictions than frequent frames.
Frequent frames classify a larger number of words, but do
so with lower overall accuracy.
Apart from being more accurate, the mechanisms based
on independent contexts also cluster more nouns than
verbs. This appears to be consistent with the suggestion
that children form a productive noun category earlier than
they form a verb category. The reverse is true of frequent
frames:
across
the
corpora
frequent
frames
overwhelmingly cluster verbs rather than nouns, with
noun-noun pairings making up under 5% of pairings for
half the corpora.
When considering large input sets (i.e. the merged
Manchester corpus), it becomes obvious that the
mechanisms employing independent contexts are able to
utilize the additional information contained in larger data
sets to classify a larger number of items with similar
levels of accuracy. The frequent frames mechanism also
classifies a larger number of items when employed on a
larger data set, but does so with lower accuracy. This
result suggests that one of the strengths of frequent frames
— its ability to quickly categorize a relatively large
number of items on the basis of limited data — becomes a
weakness when faced with larger datasets. Thus, the fact
that the approach does not consider the frequency with
which items occur in the target frames, results in it being
relatively brittle and sensitive to noise and infrequent
items in the input.
As an illustration, consider the frame You X to, which is
the most frequent frame for the corpus of Carl as well as
the merged Manchester corpus. Within Carl’s corpus this
frame contains 22 unique words, of which 20 (or 91%)
are verbs. Across the Manchester corpus, the same frame
contains a total of 89 unique words of which 67 (or 75%)
are verbs. This increase in non-verbs has a marked impact
on the accuracy for the frame which drops from .74 to .49.
Many of the non-verbs occurring in the frame are
legitimate (but infrequent) fillers for the frame (e.g. back,
off, down, happy, ready, anything, something, just, how,
over, not, one), while others are slightly more exotic: that
(from we brought you that to help you), tomorrow (from
who’s taking you tomorrow to playgroup) to somewhat
bizarre: card (from a thank you card to give you).
Since noisiness is an inherent property of the speech
signal, which contains frequent repetitions, retracings and
restarts, this finding suggests that frequent frames may
not be a suitable source of information for category
extraction unless combined with some sort of ‘clean-up
mechanism’ or probabilistic element. Such an addition,
however, would considerably weaken the great strength of
this approach: its ability to rapidly classify items on the
basis of little information.
All three mechanisms that computed statistics over
independent contexts were able to attain higher accuracy
levels, though they classified fewer items. It was argued
that the probabilistic nature of these mechanisms allows

It is evident from Table 3 that the probabilistic measures
deal well with the addition of the utterance boundary as a
framing element. Accuracy levels are comparable to those
shown in Table 1, while the number of word pairings has
increased by a factor 2 to 3. Inspection of Table 4
furthermore indicates that the increase in completeness is
largely the result of increased linking of noun pairs. This
is particularly noticeable in the square root cosine
similarity model, which links twice as many words as the
rank order model. Thus, the average square root cosine
similarity model links over 4700 noun-noun pairs,
compared to ~1900 for the rank order model. This
difference reflects the greater frequency sensitivity of the
cosine model, and suggests that square root of raw
frequency represents an optimum level of frequency
sensitivity.

Conclusions
The main aim of this paper was to compare a mechanism
for extracting syntactic categories based on independent
contexts with Mintz style frequent frames in terms of their
accuracy and ability to cluster nouns and verbs. A
secondary aim was to investigate the role of frequency
sensitivity and availability of utterance boundaries as
framing elements.

them to utilize the additional information in larger corpora
without suffering from the brittleness associated with
frequent frames.
A similar pattern emerges when including utterance
boundaries as context items. For independent contexts,
the inclusion of utterance boundaries results in
comparable levels of accuracy, coupled with greater
levels of completeness. The inclusion of utterance
boundaries in frequent frames results in a drop in
performance, in particular when considering the merged
corpus. Such a finding may not be surprising (and indeed
may not be in the ‘spirit’ of frequent frames), since the
inclusion of utterance boundaries leads to the measure
being less constrained than the lexical frequent frames
that were originally proposed by Mintz. It does, however,
provide an additional indication that independent contexts
are less brittle and better able to incorporate additional,
potentially noisy information.
The increased flexibility of independent contexts is
further underscored by the analyses relating to the nounverb asymmetry. Empirical work has suggested that
children are more likely to substitute novel nouns in
familiar contexts than they are to substitute novel verbs.
(Akhtar & Tomasello, 1997; Tomasello, 2000). If the
number of classified nouns versus verbs is an indication
of such a tendency, frequent frames would appear to
result in levels of verb-richness that are overly high. Thus,
when excluding utterance boundaries, noun pairs make up
on average only 28% of noun and verb pairs for frequent
frames, compared to approximately 80% for independent
contexts. While the inclusion of utterance boundaries
leads to higher levels of noun pairs in the frequent frames
approach, the results from Table 2 suggest that this is
achieved at the expense of accuracy. For independent
contexts, accuracy and noun richness remain high, whilst
completeness is improved relative to the condition
without utterance boundaries.
Some differences were also apparent within the
different implementations of independent contexts. The
present paper compared three different measures that
differed primarily in terms of the weighting of frequency
information. Within the constraints employed (which
included a threshold value that results in an average
accuracy level of approximately 90%), it was apparent
that a similarity measure based on raw frequency counts
results in relatively low completeness, while
completeness for square root cosine similarity and rank
order correlations perform at similar levels of
completeness, with the square root cosine similarity
measure showing more of a noun advantage than the less
frequency sensitive rank order correlation. Overall, the
inclusion of utterance boundaries leads to higher levels of
noun-richness, suggesting it is a useful source of
information. The size of this effect of noun-richness
however was dependent upon frequency sensitivity: while
noun-richness increased for all probabilistic measures,
this was most pronounced for the square root cosine

similarity, suggesting that this represents an optimum
level of frequency sensitivity.
