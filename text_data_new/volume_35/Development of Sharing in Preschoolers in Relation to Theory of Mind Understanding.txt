Abstract
This study aimed to explore the relationship between
children’s sharing behavior and Theory of Mind (ToM)
understanding. Seventy-four 2 to 4 years old Chinese children
participated in 3 tasks using toys that could be shared with a
puppet that was animated by a female experimenter. On each
task, the puppet expressed her desire for the items using a
series of cues that progressively became more
communicative. Children’s ToM understanding was assessed
with the scale of ToM tasks (Wellman, Fang, Liu, Zhu, &
Liu, 2006). There were two main findings: (1) younger
children relied on more explicit communicative cues to share
resources with the puppet, while older children shared more
spontaneously and (2) children’s sharing behavior was
positively correlated to their ToM scores, independent of age.
Findings suggest that preschoolers’ sharing behavior is
enhanced by their ToM understanding and explicit
communicative cues provided by a social partner.
Keywords: preschoolers; sharing behavior; Theory of Mind
understanding.

Introduction
Sharing is an important aspect of human cooperative
activities with roots very early in life. Studies have shown
that infants as young as 8 months old show spontaneous
offering of food and other objects to parents (e.g., Hay &
Murray, 1982; Hay, 1979; Rheingold, Hay, & West, 1976).
Though sharing emerges early, it appears to be a unique
challenge for young children. Sharing resources is a much
less frequent activity compared to other cooperative
activities in young children, such as empathy-related
responding, helping and instrument collaboration
(Eisenberg, 2005; Grusec, 1991; Warneken & Tomasello,
2007, 2009). Toddlers share toys with others rarely, though
the rate of sharing increases from 12 to 30 months of age
(e.g., Brownell, Svetlova, & Nichols, 2009; Hay, Castle,
Davies, Demetriou, & Stimson, 1999; Levitt, Weber, Clark,
& McDonnell, 1985). Other work has shown that
preschoolers also share little. For example, three- to fiveyear-old children reserved 10 pieces of food for themselves
while sharing only one piece of food with their peers (Birch
& Billman, 1986). Sharing is difficult for children probably
because it results in a sacrifice of something valued for the

welfare of someone else. There is evidence suggesting that
children share more if there is no sacrifice compared to
identical circumstances with sacrifices (Svetlova, Nichols,
& Brownell, 2010; Thompson, Barresi, & Moore, 1997).
Though numerous studies have been conducted on
sharing behavior, it remains difficult to depict the
development of sharing, partially because many studies do
not control the circumstances under which sharing was
observed. For example, we do not know whether early
social acts of offering items to others are primarily otheroriented unless we control for the social partner’s behavior.
In these cases, infants may just be seeking attention or
reaction from the social partner, or may be complying with
the request of others. Previous studies have shown that 2year-old children shared food with an adult only when the
adult actively communicated directly about what she wanted
(Brownell et al., 2009), or reached toward the child with
palm up while alternating gaze between the child and the
food (Dunfield, Kuhlmeier, O’Connell, & Kelley, 2011).
Therefore, it is unclear to what extend children’s “sharing”
acts are truly sharing behavior with the intention to benefit
others if the recipient’s behavior is not controlled. By
systematically manipulating the social partner’s behavior,
we might get a comprehensive understanding of the
development of other-oriented resource sharing (see also
Brownell, Iesue, Nichols, & Svetlova, 2012). Therefore, the
first goal of the present study was to examine how the social
partner’s communication supports young children’s sharing.
To do this, we systematically manipulated the expressive
cues provided by the partner in the sharing task such that the
partner made her needs progressively more explicit with a
ﬁxed sequence of cues. We then aimed to see at what point
children would share.
Another unaddressed question is how we explain the
development of sharing in children. Current theories have
proposed various underlying mechanisms of sharing, such
as the basic imitative tendencies toward people (Grusec,
2006; Hay & Cook, 2007; Rheingold, 1982), the ability to
differentiate self’s and other’s internal states (e.g., Moore,
2007), the sympathetic ability to relate self’s emotions and
feelings to other’s (e.g., Eisenberg, 2007; Zahn-Waxler &
Radke-Yarrow, 1990), the understanding of ownership

3811

(Brownell et al., 2012), and an innate biological preposition
for empathy and altruism in infants (Tomasello, 2008;
Warneken & Tomasello, 2009b; Zahn-Waxler, Robinson, &
Emde, 1992). These different theoretical perspectives
emphasize
the
social-cognitive
and
motivational
components of early pro-social responding at different
levels. Yet they agree, to different extents, that the origins of
altruistic pro-social behavior are based on universal norms
of fairness and reciprocity in combination with our
understanding of other people’s needs or wants (e.g., Fehr &
Fischbacher, 2004). This ‘understanding of others’ needs
and wants’ can be manifested in the Theory of Mind (ToM)
understanding, which refers to the ability to attribute mental
states - beliefs, intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, etc.
- to oneself and others and to understand that others have
beliefs, desires and intentions that are different from one's
own (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). From this perspective, is
it possible that ToM understanding has an impact on prosocial behavior?
ToM understanding and pro-social behavior are both
undergoing significant developmental changes during the
preschool years (Benenson, Pascoe, & Radmore, 2007;
Blake & Rand, 2010; Fehr, Bernhard, & Rockenbach, 2008;
Rochat et al., 2009; Wellman et al., 2006; Wellman & Liu,
2004). Evidence suggests that these two abilities may share
the same underlying neural processes (McCabe, Houser,
Ryan, Smith, & Trouard, 2001). That is, studies using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) found that as
adult participants behaved cooperatively in a trust game,
brain areas related to ToM (medial prefrontal cortex) were
activated (McCabe et al., 2001). Moreover, previous studies
have shown that preschoolers’ ToM negatively predicted
aggressive or disruptive behavior for boys and positively
predicted pro-social behavior for girls after controlling for
age (Walker, 2005). In addition, ToM has been suggested to
be a facilitator of fairness-related behavior (Sally & Hill,
2006), such as higher proposed offers in the Ultimatum
Game (Takagishi, Kameshima, Schug, Koizumi, &
Yamagishi, 2010). These studies suggest that children with
more advanced ability of understanding others’ mental
states may need less explicit supports from the social partner
in interpreting his/her desires or needs, thus may be more
likely to perform pro-social behavior. The second aim of the
present study is to test this hypothesis in preschoolers.

Methods
Participants
Seventy-four Chinese children from two kindergartens in
Beijing, China participated in the study. Both kindergartens
largely served children of university staff and faculty in
urban Beijing. There were twenty-five 2-year-olds (M =
28.86 months, SD = 3.16, range: 24.46 – 34.43 months; 14
girls), twenty-five 3-year-olds (M = 39.49 months, SD =
2.21, range: 34.92 – 42.69 months; 12 girls), and twentyfour 4-year-olds (M = 47.30 months, SD = 2.51, range:

43.02 – 51.08 months; 14 girls). An additional 3-year-old
boy was excluded from the study due to experimenter error.

Materials and Procedure
Each child participated in both the sharing task and the
Theory of Mind task in a quiet separate room adjacent to the
child’s classroom. Testing was conducted by a female
experimenter (E) performing a hand puppet (a brown bear)
named “Maomao” along with the help of a female assistant
(AE). The session began with a warm-up and familiarization
period during which Maomao (animated by E) and AE
played with the child for several minutes to ensure that the
child was comfortable approaching and interacting with
both of them. The order of the sharing tasks and the theory
of mind tasks were counterbalanced. All the sessions were
video recorded.
Sharing Tasks. Three sharing tasks were administered with
order counterbalanced across participants. Each task
featured different items to be shared: there were 2 stickers in
the ‘sticker’ task, 2 toy watermelons and 2 knives in the
‘watermelon’ task, 4 colorful beads and 2 strings in the
‘bead’ task. Therefore, there were 12 items in total across
these three sharing tasks. These items were shown to be
equally liked by children in a pilot study. Children thus had
multiple opportunities to share different types of toys. This
aimed to provide a relatively comprehensive measurement
of sharing behavior. During the test, Maomao sat across a
child-sized table from the child, and AE sat to one side of
the table, at a 90-degree angle to the child and the puppet.
After a short familiarization, AE brought out toys, and
showed the child and the puppet how to play with these
toys. AE then left the room, asking the child, “Could you
please take care of these toys when I am gone? I’ll be back
soon. You can play with them by yourself, or with your new
friend Maomao. Thanks, bye!” She then left the room. After
AE left, Maomao provided three progressively more explicit
cues about her needs and desires. The cues were presented
in three phases: (1) Commenting phase: when the child was
exploring toys, Maomao positively commented on the toys,
such as “these are so beautiful!” She then repeated this 2
times, pausing for about 10 seconds between each. (2)
Desiring phase: Maomao expressed her desires for these
toys, such as “I like these toys! I want to play with them” in
the same manner as the first phase. (3) Requesting phase:
Maomao made an explicit request by asking the child for
these toys, such as “would you please give me some to play
with” in the same manner as the other phases. If the child
shared at any point, Maomao discontinued the cues, thanked
the child, and played with the toy(s) for about 10 seconds,
and then signaled AE that the task ended by knocking the
table. If the child did not share in the final phase, E signaled
AE in the same way. AE then came back and moved on to a
second sharing task with new toys.
Scale of Theory of Mind Tasks. These tasks were modeled
after the Chinese version of the five core ToM

3812

understanding tasks (Wellman et al., 2006; Wellman & Liu,
2004). A small toy figure with Chinese visages and dark
hair, whose name was Feifei, served as the target
protagonist for the tasks. Although formats and general
ideas were not different from the tasks used by Wellman
and his colleagues (2006), task materials were modified in
several places so that they were familiar and appropriate for
our sample.
Diverse Desires: The participant was presented with
pictures of an apple and a pear, and was asked to pick one
that s/he liked better. Then s/he was told that Feifei likes X
better where X was always the opposite of the child’s
answer. The subsequent question for the child was which
one Feifei would choose if she was hungry.
Diverse Beliefs: The participant was presented with
pictures of a schoolbag and a drawer along with a picture of
a car, and was told that Feifei was looking for her car. Then
the child was asked to choose where (schoolbag vs. drawer)
s/he believed the car was. The experimenter (E) then stated
that Feifei thinks the car is in X, where again X was always
the opposite of the child’s answer. The subsequent target
question asked of the child was where Feifei was going to
search for her car.
Knowledge Access: the participant saw a box with a fork
inside. E then told the child that Feifei had never opened
this box before. The target question was whether Feifei
knew what was inside the box.
Contents False Belief: E presented the participant with a
box with pictures of cookies on it. E then asked the child
what s/he thought was inside the box. She then showed the
child that it was actually a small pencil inside. After
showing the child the real contents of the box, she told the
child that Feifei had never opened this box. The target
question was what Feifei thought was inside the box.
Real-Apparent Emotion: the participant saw a sheet of
paper with three faces on it – a happy, a neutral, and a sad
face. After ensuring that the child understands these
emotional expressions, E told the child a story about a boy
expecting a toy gun as his birthday gift, but actually getting
a boring book. But he did not want to behave impolitely, so
he decided to hide his feelings. The child was then asked
how this boy really felt and how he tried to appear to others
by pointing to the pictures with faces.

Coding and Scoring
Each child received a score of sharing from 0-3 for each
task, corresponding to the phase during which sharing
occurred: 0 = did not share at all; 1 = shared in the
requesting phase; 2 = shared in the desiring phase; 3 =
shared in the commenting phase. Higher scores thus
indicated quicker sharing with less explicit cues from the
recipient. Scores were averaged over the three tasks to
create an average sharing score for each child. In addition,
the number of items shared by each child in all three sharing
tasks (0-12 items in total) was also coded.
Children got a score of 1 for each ToM understanding
task they passed. Thus, the range for ToM scores was 0-5.

The first author coded all of the videos, and another coder
blind to the research goal rated 25% of these videos.
Cohen’s kappa was computed to measure inter-rater
reliability. Values for Cohen’s kappa were 1.00 for the
number of items shared in the sharing tasks as well as scores
in the TOM task, and were 0.98 for the sharing score.

Results
Preliminary analysis using the sharing score and the number
of items shared by children showed that there were no
significant main effects of task order or sex, nor was there
an interaction between task order and sex. Therefore, the
following analyses were conducted by collapsing the data
across these factors.

Age Differences in Sharing and ToM
An ANOVA test was conducted with the average sharing
score as the dependent variable and age as the independent
variable. Results showed that older children shared more
spontaneously than did younger children, F (2, 71) = 6.38, p
= .003, partial η2 = .15 (see Table 1 for means and standard
deviations). Bonferroni corrected post-hoc tests showed that
4-year-old children had significantly higher sharing scores
than 2- and 3-year-olds, p = .006, .011, respectively, yet
there was no significant difference between children of the
two younger groups, p = 1.00.
Another ANOVA test was conducted with the total
number of items shared as the dependent variable.
Interestingly, no significant age effect was found, F (2, 71)
= 1.36, p = .26, partial η2 = .04 (see Table 1).

In addition, children’s total ToM score also increased
significantly with age, F (2, 71) = 14.73, p < .001, partial η2
= .29. More specifically, the age effect was significant in
children’s score on the task of Diverse Beliefs [F (2, 71) =
3.33, p = .04, partial η2 = .09], the task of Knowledge
Access [F (2, 71) = 11.41, p < .001, partial η2 = .24], the

= .06], as shown in Table 1.

analyses indicate that preschoolers’ performance on the
ToM tasks, rather than age, was responsible for both the
average sharing score and the number of items shared over
three sharing tasks.

Discussion
Associations between Sharing and ToM
Since significant age effects were found in both scores of
sharing and ToM understanding tasks, Pearson partial
correlational analyses were conducted to investigate
whether sharing was associated with ToM understanding
after controlling for age. Results showed that the total score
of ToM, Diverse Beliefs and Knowledge Access were both
positively correlated to children’s sharing scores and the
number of items shared with age being controlled for, r’s
ranged .26 - .36, p’s < .05 (for details, see Table 2).
However, the scores of Diverse Desires and Real-Apparent
Emotion did not correlate significantly to sharing.
To further examine the effect of ToM understanding on
children’s sharing behavior, we conducted a series of
multiple regression analyses. We first regressed age on the
sharing score and found that age had a significant effect on
the sharing score (β = .30, p = .01), but the model only
explained 8.7% of the variance in the sharing score, F (1, 72)
= 6.87, p = .01. This age effect became non-significant (β
= .06, p = .65) as the total ToM score was added as another
independent variable. The effect of ToM was significant (β
= .42, p = .002), and increased the variance accounted by
11.8%, Fchange (1, 71) = 10.55, p = .002. After adding ToM
as the predictor, the full model explained 20.5% of the
variance in sharing score, F (2, 71) = 9.17, p < .001.

Similarly, we conducted another regression analysis with
the total number of items shared as the dependent variable.
Results showed that age alone had no significant effect on
the number of items shared (β = .07, p = .54), and the model
only explained 0.5% of the variance in the number of shared
items, F (1, 72) = .38, p = .54. After adding ToM as the
independent variable, the full model explained 12.3% of the
variance in the number of items shared, F (2, 71) = 4.98, p
= .01. The effect of ToM was significant (β = .42, p = .003),
and increased the variance accounted by 11.8%, Fchange (1,
71) = 9.54, p = .003. The results of the above regression

First, consistent with our hypothesis, we found that 4year-old children needed less communicative cues to share
than 2- and 3-year-old children did. Four-year-old children
generally shared when the partner was just commenting on
the toys, whereas the majority of the other two younger
groups of children shared when the partner verbally
requested the items. This result suggests that older children
might need less scaffolding from a social partner to perform
sharing behavior (Brownell, Iesue, et al., 2012; Brownell et
al., 2009; Svetlova et al., 2010). It also implies that older
children might have a more robust intention to benefit others
as they shared spontaneously and quickly with a partner
who had no toys, while younger children might only share
under pressure or to comply with another’s request (e.g.,
Hay, Caplan, Castle, & Stimson, 1991). Our results thus add
new evidence to previous findings that toddlers need more
explicit cues to perform sharing and helping behavior
(Brownell et al., 2009, 2012; Svetlova et al., 2010).
Interestingly, we found that even though 2- and 3-yearold children needed more communicative support in order to
perform sharing behavior (their sharing scores were lower),
once they shared, they shared as many objects with the
social partner as older children did. Blake and Rand (2010)
also found that even though 6-year-old children were more
likely to donate stickers than 3-year-old children did, once
they shared, they gave the same amount of stickers at all
ages. These results imply that children may engage in two
separate decisions when interacting with a social partner: (a)
whether to share and (b) how much to share. As proposed
by Blake and Rand (2010), the different developmental
trajectories of these two choices may imply different
processes involved in those two different phases of sharing
behavior. More studies are required to identify these
differential underlying processes.
More importantly, we found that children’s Theory of
Mind understanding correlated to their sharing behavior,
independent of age. The regression analyses showed that
ToM was a significant predictor of how spontaneously and
quickly children shared, as well as how many items children
shared, whereas age did not predict these sharing measures.
These results suggest that ToM understanding might be a
potential underlying mechanism of children’s age-related
increase in sharing.
This finding is consistent with and extends previous
research demonstrating associations between theory of mind
ability and pro-social behavior. For example, prior studies
have shown that theory of mind ability correlates to prosocial behavior (e.g., Sally & Hill, 2006; Walker, 2005), and
there is evidence suggesting that these two abilities may
share the same underlying neural processes (McCabe et al.,
2001). Furthermore, studies of nonhuman primates have

3814

found that chimpanzees, which do not have as well of a
developed theory of mind as compared to humans, are
rational maximizers in that they make unfair offers and
accept unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game (Jensen, Call, &
Tomasello, 2007). Likewise, children who had more
advanced theory of mind abilities proposed more fair offers
in the Ultimatum Game than children with less advanced
theory of mind (Takagishi et al., 2010). These results
suggest that fairness-related behavior is related to the ability
to infer the mental states and intentions of others. Our
findings thus further support this hypothesis by showing that
more advanced theory of mind ability was positively
associated with children’s spontaneous sharing and the
amount of items shared with others.
In sum, the present study showed that sharing behavior
may be more likely to occur when the partner makes his/her
needs, desires and emotions more apparent, thus reducing
the need for complex inferences about others’ internal states,
especially for young children whose ability to infer others’
psychological states are immature. For older children who
have more advanced ToM understanding, the requirement of
the provision of ostensive cues from the recipient may not
be necessary, thus they shared more spontaneously, more
quickly and shared more items.
