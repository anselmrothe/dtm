Abstract
Previous research indicates learning words facilitates
categorization. In the current study, we investigated whether
learning about a category facilitates word learning (retention)
by presenting 2-year-old children with multiple referent
selection trials to the same object category. Children either
encountered the same exemplar repeatedly or encountered
multiple exemplars across trials. All children did very well on
the initial task. However, only children who encountered
multiple exemplars retained these mappings after a short
delay. Overall, these data provide strong evidence that
providing children with the opportunity to compare across
exemplars during referent selection facilitates retention.
Keywords: word learning; fast mapping; categorization;
multiple exemplars

Learning the names for object categories is necessary for
children to make sense of their world and to communicate
about it effectively. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that
children’s early vocabularies are dominated by names for
object categories (Samuelson & Smith, 1999; Waxman,
2003). Previous research has demonstrated a close
relationship
between
vocabulary
acquisition
and
categorization (e.g., Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1992; Thom &
Sandhofer, 2009). However, although several studies have
demonstrated
knowing
more
words
facilitates
categorization, it remains unclear how experience with
object categories may facilitate word learning.
Word learning is a complicated process, involving both
fast and slow mapping (McMurray, Horst, & Samuelson,
2012). The first time a novel name is encountered, the child
quickly forms an initial, rough hypothesis of the word’s
meaning—hence the term fast mapping (Carey, 1978). For
example, when presented with a boat, a cup and a novel
black-and-white stuffed animal and asked for the penguin, a
2-year-old child can reliably determine that penguin refers
to the animal (PENGUIN). However, simply forming this
initial mapping does not mean that the child has really
learned the word—that is, that the child could recall the
name-object association after a delay or in a new context,
for example with other novel toys (Horst & Samuelson,
2008; Riches, Tomasello, & Conti-Ramsden, 2005,
Waxman & Booth, 2000). Indeed, processing demands

might prevent young children from learning the correct
name-object association after only a single exposure
(Mather & Plunkett, 2009).
In contrast to fast mapping, full word learning emerges
gradually during a period of slow mapping (Capone &
McGregor, 2005; Carey, 1978; Horst & Samuelson, 2008).
During this phase repeated encounters allow the child to
strengthen the name-object association such that it can be
recalled after a delay. Importantly, the penguin-PENGUIN
association will be strengthened each time the child hears
the word penguin and sees the animal in a new situation. For
example, a child might see a stuffed penguin at daycare and
then later play with a penguin and other animals during bath
time at home. Across such situations children learn about
the statistical regularity with which the names and their
referents co-occur (cross-situational word learning; Munro,
Baker, McGregor, Docking & Arculi, 2012; Smith & Yu,
2008). Clearly, then, repeated exposures are critical for
word learning.
However, children do not only learn names for
individual items, but also learn names for object categories.
Categories are collections of items which share common
features (e.g., Quinn, Eimas & Rosenkrantz, 1993; Rosch,
1975), but which are still discriminable from each other. In
the PENGUIN category, for instance, the majority of members
share the common features of black-and-white coloring, two
legs and the ability to swim, but the individual members are
discriminable. For example, a child can discriminate
between a stuffed penguin and a plastic penguin bath toy.
Importantly, during early word learning, children not only
encounter the same category exemplar repeatedly but may
encounter multiple, different exemplars over time.
When children are presented with multiple exemplars
across situations, they may compare across items, which
induces categorization by helping children to detect both the
commonalities and differences between the category
members, both of which are critical for categorization (e.g.,
Kovack-Lesh & Oakes, 2007; Oakes & Ribar, 2005).
Kovack-Lesh and Oakes (2007) have reported that simply
providing the opportunity to compare across exemplars
during the transition between trials is enough to help infants
form a category they otherwise do not form when presented

2566

with the same items in the same sequence. This is especially
important because it demonstrates that young children are
able to compare between exemplars across trials.
Namy and Gentner (2002) as well as others (e.g.,
Casasola, Bhagwat, & Burke, 2009; Waxman, 2003) have
previously argued that applying a common name to multiple
exemplars invites children to compare across items and
draws their attention to shared commonalities. For example,
when two objects are given the same name, children will
extend this common name to new objects that share the
same perceptual features with the named exemplars (e.g.,
Samuelson & Smith, 1999). Importantly, these findings
demonstrate that exposing children to multiple, variable
exemplars labeled with a common, novel name allows
children to detect the similarities between objects and
therefore facilitates categorization.
However, it remains unclear whether comparison
facilitates children’s ability to retain category names
because the existing studies on the effect of presenting
multiple category exemplars on word learning have focused
largely on generalization. For example, in a longitudinal
category training study, toddlers who encountered multiple
perceptually variable exemplars experienced a significant
acceleration in vocabulary growth and were able to
generalize novel names to novel exemplars from the same
categories, in contrast to children who encountered
perceptually similar exemplars (Perry, Samuelson, Malloy,
& Schiffer, 2010).
The current study examines whether providing children
with the opportunity to compare across exemplars facilitates
their ability to learn and retain names for novel object
categories. We tested 2-year-old children because they can
complete multiple trials without becoming overly tired and
enjoy this particular task. We provided children with
multiple fast mapping by mutual exclusivity trials to better
understand how encountering multiple exemplars facilitates
cross-situational word learning. Further, while previous
studies have investigated how encountering multiple
exemplars effects children’s generalization of novel names,
the current study explores the effect on retention.
Specifically, children encountered each novel object
category across three referent selection trials. Half of the
children were repeatedly presented with the same exemplar
across trials and half of the children were presented with
multiple exemplars across trials. If providing the
opportunity to compare across exemplars facilitates crosssituational word learning, then children who fast-mapped
multiple exemplars should demonstrate better retention.

Method
Participants
Twenty-four children aged 2;6 (13 girls, M = 2;6 SD = 43.19
days; range = 2;4 – 2;8) with a mean productive vocabulary
of 563.75 words (SD = 81.91 words, range = 391 - 668
words) and no family history of colorblindness participated.
Children were from predominantly middle class homes.
Half of the children were randomly assigned to the single

exemplars condition and the other half were randomly
assigned to the multiple exemplars condition. Children’s
ages and productive vocabularies did not differ between
conditions. Data from two additional children were
excluded from analyses due to fussiness and experimenter
error. Parents were reimbursed for travel expenses and
children received a small gift for participating.

Figure 1: Novel stimuli
Stimuli
Eighteen known objects, chosen because they are highly
familiar to 2-year-old children, served as familiar objects:
bird, chicken, elephant, fish, giraffe, lion, boat, bus, car,
motorcycle, plane, train, block, chair, comb, cup, toy mobile
phone and spoon.
Nine novel objects from three categories, chosen because
they are not easily named by 2-year-old children, served as
the target objects (see Figure 1). Consistent with other
studies (e.g., Vlach, Sandhofer, & Kornell, 2008), the
objects in these categories varied in color and texture, but
shared the same shape.
The doff category consisted of slightly transparent, plussign shaped tops in yellow, green and red. The cheem
category consisted of plastic rods with small balls on one
end in blue/orange, orange/blue and yellow/green. The hux
category consisted of rubber balloons with elastic strings
hanging down in blue/orange, yellow/blue and green. The
balloons kept their shape because they had foam balls inside
them. All objects were similar in size (5cm x 8cm x 10cm).
Stimuli were presented on a white tray divided into three
even sections. A digital kitchen timer was used to time the
5-minute break.
Procedure and Design
Before the experiment began, the experimenter showed the
parent color photographs of the known and novel objects to
ensure they were known and novel to the child, respectively
(which they were for all children). During the experiment,
children were seated in a booster seat at a white table across
from the experimenter. Parents sat next to their children and
completed a vocabulary checklist and were instructed to

2567

avoid interacting with their children, but to encourage them
to respond during the warm-up trials if necessary. None of
the children needed parental encouragement after the warmup trials.
Warm-up trials Each session began with three warm-up
trials to introduce children to the task. On each trial,
children were presented with three randomly selected
known objects. First, the experimenter set the tray of objects
on the table and silently counted for three seconds to give
the child an opportunity to look at the objects (see also,
Horst, Scott, & Pollard, 2010). Then, the experimenter
asked the child to select an object by naming it twice (e.g.,
“Can you find the block? Can you get the block?”) before
sliding the tray forward. Children were praised heavily for
correct responses and corrected if necessary. Between trials
the experimenter replaced the tray on her lap and arranged
the objects for the next trial out of the child’s view.
The same objects were presented on each warm-up trial,
but object positions (left, middle, right) were pseudorandomized across trials. Thus, children were asked for a
different object in a different position on each trial. These
stimuli were later used as known objects during the referent
selection trials (see also, Horst & Samuelson, 2008).
Referent Selection Task. Referent selection trials immediately followed the warm-up trials and proceeded in the same
manner except that children were neither praised nor
corrected.
Each child was presented with nine sets and saw each set
once on a known name referent selection trial and once on a
novel name trial for a total of 18 referent selection trials (see
Figure 2 for examples). Known name trials were included to
ensure that children were mapping the names to the
requested targets and not simply mapping novelty to novelty
(Horst, Samuelson, Kucker & McMurray, 2011).

Figure 2: Trials on which a doff exemplar was present

Each set included two familiar objects (e.g., boat and cup)
and one novel object (e.g., top). Children in the multiple
exemplars condition saw a different novel exemplar in each
set. For example, a child might see the green top with the
block and lion, the red top with the chair and train and the
yellow top with the bus and fish (see Figure 2). Children in
the single exemplars condition saw the same exemplar in
each set. For example, a child might see the green top with
the block and lion, and again the chair and train and once
more with the bus and fish. Thus, the only difference
between conditions was whether children saw one or three
exemplars from each category.
Referent selection trials were presented in three blocks.
For example, one child completed all trials with the doff
category, then all trials with the cheem category and finally
all trials with the hux category. Block order was
counterbalanced across participants using a Latin Square
design. The order of known and novel trials was pseudorandomized in each block such that the same set (e.g., green
top, lion, block) was never presented on two consecutive
trials and no more than two trials of either type (i.e., known
or novel) were presented sequentially. Object position (left,
middle, right) was randomly determined on each trial.
Between the referent selection task and the retention task the
child remained at the table and colored pictures during a 5minute delay period, which was included to ensure that
children’s retention was based on long-term memory
representations for the novel name-object associations
formed during the referent selection phase rather than shortterm maintenance (for a similar argument see, Horst &
Samuelson, 2008).
Retention Task The retention task was the same in both
conditions. First, to re-engage children in the task, a new
warm-up trial with three different known objects was
presented. This was immediately followed by three retention
trials, during which children saw three novel exemplars: one
from each novel category (top, rod, balloon). The same
exemplars were presented on all trials for a given child. In
the single exemplars condition, children were presented
with the same exemplars encountered earlier. In the multiple
exemplars condition, children were presented with one of
the three exemplars encountered earlier, with each exemplar
(e.g., green top) being presented equally often across
children. Object positions were randomized across trials and
children were asked for a different novel object in a
different position on each trial.
Coding. Children’s responses were coded offline from
DVD. Responses included touching and picking up objects
(see Horst et al., 2011, for a deeper discussion of possible
responses on this type of task). A naïve coder coded 20% of
the sessions for reliability. Inter-coder agreement was high,
M = 98.08%, SD = 3.44% (range = 92.31% – 100.00%).
Overall, 90% of the target words were included in the
analyses of children’s retention as, like prior studies, only
the words that a child correctly fast-mapped at least once

2568

during the referent selection trials were included in
subsequent analyses. There was no evidence of group
differences in interest/attention during the experiment.

Results
We first compare children’s performance to chance levels
and then compare children’s performance between
conditions. As can be clearly seen in the left panel of Figure
3, children in both conditions were very accurate at
choosing the target object during the initial referent
selection task. On known name referent selection trials, 11
children in each condition chose the target on every trial,
and one child in each condition chose the target on 8/9 trials.
Thus, children’s proportion of target choices was the same
for both conditions and greater than would be expected by
chance (.33), t(11) = 71.73, p < .0001, d = 20.60 (all ps are
two-tailed). On novel name referent selection trials,
children’s proportion of target choices was also greater than
expected by chance (.33) both for children in the multiple
exemplars condition, t(11) = 6.57, p < .0001, d = 2.38 and
for children in the single exemplars condition, t(11) = 4.59,
p < .001, d = .84. Again, there was no difference between
conditions, t(22) = .345, ns. Thus, whether children
encountered multiple exemplars or the same exemplars
repeatedly during referent selection did not influence
children’s performance on either known or novel name
referent selection trials.
Our main question in this experiment was whether
encountering multiple exemplars or the same exemplars
repeatedly during referent selection influenced retention. As
can be seen in the right panel of Figure 3, only children in
the multiple exemplars condition retained more names than
expected by chance (.33), t(11) = 5.00, p < .001, d = 1.46.
Children in the single exemplars condition failed to retain
more words than expected by chance, t(11) = 1.47, ns, d =
.44. An unpaired t-test confirmed that children who
encountered multiple exemplars retained more words than
children who encountered the same exemplars repeatedly,
t(22) = 2.06, p ≤ .05, d = .16.

To further understand how multiple exemplars influence
children’s ability to retain newly fast-mapped names we
also explored retention as a function of number of
successful referent selection trials. As can be seen in Table
1, when children only successfully fast-mapped on one of
the three trials, they were unable to retain that name over a
5-minute delay, regardless of whether they saw the same or
different exemplars on their two unsuccessful trials. When
children successfully fast-mapped twice, they were able to
retain that category name if they encountered multiple
exemplars but not if they encountered the same exemplar
repeatedly. Finally, when children successfully fast-mapped
three times, they were able to retain that name whether they
had mapped the name to multiple exemplars or to the same
exemplar repeatedly. Taken together, these data confirm that
multiple exemplars facilitate word learning via fast mapping
and that sufficient encounters with the same exemplar can
also lead to retention.

Discussion
The current study explored how providing the opportunity to
compare across multiple category exemplars facilitates
children’s ability to learn and retain names for novel object
categories. We presented 2-year-old children with multiple
referent selection trials with the same object category.
Children either encountered the same exemplar repeatedly
or multiple exemplars across trials. Overall, all children did
very well on the initial referent selection task. However,
only children who encountered multiple exemplars retained
the previously fast-mapped novel names after a delay.
Further, these children demonstrated significantly better
retention than children who only encountered the same
exemplar repeatedly.
Overall, these data demonstrate that experience with
multiple exemplars facilitates word learning, specifically
retention of fast-mapped names for object categories. Other
studies that have explored the relationship between
vocabulary and categorization have typically tested children
over a long time scale, such as several weeks (Ellis &
Oakes, 2006; Perry et al., 2010). However, the current study
reveals that exposing children to an object category, rather
than a single category member, facilitates children’s ability
to learn the name for that category within minutes (see also
Kemler Nelson, O'Neil, & Asher, 2008).

2569

These findings also add to the literature demonstrating
that comparison facilitates categorization (e.g., Gentner &
Namy, 1999; Kovack-Lesh & Oakes, 2007) and that
applying a common name to multiple exemplars invites
children to compare across items, drawing their attention to
shared commonalities (Casasola et al., 2009; Gentner &
Namy, 1999; Namy & Gentner, 2002; Plunkett, Hu &
Cohen, 2008). It is likely that children also learned from
encountering the same exemplars repeatedly, but that this
learning was not robust enough to withstand a short delay.
The current study also demonstrates that behavior is the
product of nested timescales, consistent with dynamic
systems theory (Thelen & Smith, 1994). Specifically, in the
current study, children’s ability to retain words emerged as a
product of their present (what they were currently seeing),
their just previous past (how many exemplars they had just
fast-mapped) and their past (their developmental history of
learning about names and categories).
Importantly, these data clearly indicate that encountering
multiple exemplars led to better novel name retention. We
believe that children who encountered multiple exemplars
retained words at greater rates because each encounter with
a new exemplar invited them to compare the new exemplar
to their stored memory representations for that object
category, thus enabling them to encode additional
information. That is, as each exemplar was encountered
children’s stored memory representations were updated and
elaborated. This explanation is consistent with exemplar
theories of categorization (e.g., Murphy, 2002; Medin &
Schaffer, 1978; Nosofsky, 1984), which argue that
individual representations are formed each time an exemplar
is encountered.
Previous research that has investigated how multiple
exemplars influence children’s word learning has done so
by presenting multiple exemplars at test. After encountering
a single exemplar from the target category, children are
typically presented with one of two types of test trials.
Using referent selection tasks, children are tested with
another exemplar from the same category, a completely
novel foil and known foils (e.g., Mervis & Bertrand, 1994;
Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, Bailey & Wenger, 1992). Children
are very good at selecting the target as opposed to a
completely novel object. However, any delay is minimal
(e.g., 1-2 trials later), thus we cannot be sure that we are
testing children’s long-term memory for new words rather
than short-term maintaince.
Using naturalistic play situations, children are tested after
a short delay, but they are tested with the same previouslyencountered exemplar, another exemplar from the same
category and a novel foil (e.g., Jaswal & Markman, 2003;
Waxman & Booth, 2000). Children are very good at
selecting the previously-encountered exemplar, however, it
is not clear that we are testing generalization if the same
exemplar is presented again. In addition, these tasks do not
control for novelty differences between the test alternatives,
which can have a profound effect on children’s responses
(Horst, et al., 2011).

The current study is different. Specifically, we presented
multiple exemplars during referent selection to provide an
opportunity to compare across exemplars during fast
mapping to investigate the effect of comparison on full
word learning. Note, other studies that have tested
children’s retention for name-object associations learned via
referent selection have only included one exemplar for each
category (e.g., Horst & Samuelson, 2008; Kucker &
Samuelson, 2011), although, recently Ankowski, Vlach and
Sandhofer (2012) presented multiple exemplars to
demonstrate that simultaneous presentation facilitates
abstraction and generalization for new category members
better than spaced presentation. In addition, the relative
novelty of the test alternatives was controlled as each had
previously served as a target and each had been encountered
the same number of times. Thus, although previous research
has tested the strength of children’s newly formed nameobject category associations by presenting different
exemplars at test, the current study is the first fast mapping
study to explore the role of comparison in word learning by
manipulating the strength of children’s name-object
category associations formed during referent selection
across encounters with multiple exemplars.
Overall, then, the current study adds to a growing body of
evidence that experience with multiple exemplars and
within-category variability influences young children’s
word learning. Importantly, this study demonstrates that
categorization can have a profound effect on children’s
word learning over a short time scale. Thus, the current
study is among the first to systematically investigate the
interplay between category variability and cross-situational
word learning, and as such provides important groundwork
for further research in the area, as well as informs our
understanding of category learning and cognitive development, more generally.
