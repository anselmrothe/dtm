Abstract

There is evidence that, even outside of experimental manipulations to that effect, the nature of the evidence for recognition may vary over time. Information about the “oldness” of
individual items is available quite early in processing, while
associative information (e.g., whether a word pair was studied in intact or rearranged order) requires approximately an
additional 200 ms to become available (Gronlund & Ratcliff, 1989). And Hintzman and Curran (1994, Experiment 3)
found that, when tested with a foil that was a plural or singular
form of a word that had been studied in the opposite plurality
(e.g., “apple” was studied and “apples” was tested), subjects’
tendency to endorse the foil initially increased but then reversed at longer response lags. These results are consistent
with a recognition process that accumulates information over
time, but at different rates for different kinds of information
(e.g., Brockdorff & Lamberts, 2000).
In an attempt to better understand the dynamics of the
recognition process, we first present results from an experiment in which stimuli were constructed from a set of components which varied in diagnosticity as to whether the stimulus
is old or new. In some conditions, components became visible
at different times, allowing us to assess the effect of presenting diagnostic information later or earlier. These results are
explained in the context of a dynamic model of recognition
(Cox & Shiffrin, 2012). The mechanisms employed can also
be used to explain the “fluency” results of Jacoby and Whitehouse (1989).

Inspired by a dynamic approach to recognition memory (Cox
& Shiffrin, 2012), we present results from a recognition memory experiment in which the time at which diagnostic information arrives is unconsciously varied. Contrary to the predictions of most models, performance improves when diagnostic
information is available later, rather than earlier. These results
are accounted for by a dynamic model of recognition, where
the time at which information starts to be accumulated for a
recognition decision can vary independently of when features
are available to be sampled from the test display. The same
model is shown to be able to reproduce the priming results
of Jacoby and Whitehouse (1989), originally attributed to a
fluency heuristic. The ability to account for such seemingly
disparate results with a single model illustrates the utility of a
dynamic approach to recognition.
Keywords: Episodic memory; recognition memory; memory
models.

Introduction
Recognition continues to be a rich source of evidence regarding the processes and mechanisms that underly episodic
memory performance. Throughout its long history in psychology and cognitive science, recognition memory experiments have collected measures of reaction time. Despite this,
most theories in recognition memory have been concerned
only with accuracy. Most of the few models of recognition
that also make predictions about response time (Hockley &
Murdock, 1987; Mewhort & Johns, 2005; Malmberg, 2008;
Nosofsky & Stanton, 2006) assume nonetheless that the evidence is stationary over time (an exception is Brockdorff &
Lamberts, 2000). Thus, it would appear that much work remains to be done to better understand the fine-grained temporal aspects of the recognition process.
As a step in that direction, Cox and Shiffrin (2012) introduced a model of recognition that was based on the gradual
accumulation of features over time. As features are sampled,
they are added to a memory probe which is then compared
to all the traces in memory (or at least those above a certain threshold level of activation), resulting in a “familiarity”
value. Familiarity will move up and down over time in a noisy
fashion as features get sampled; positive changes in familiarity are evidence in favor of an “old” decision, while negative
changes favor a “new” decision. However, because only a finite number of features can be sampled, familiarity will eventually reach a (noisy) asymptote. Thus, the evidence for the
recognition process in this model is inherently nonstationary.
Furthermore, its predictions will vary greatly with experimental manipulations that affect the timing with which different
information becomes available.

Experiment 1: Dynamic Presentation
In this experiment, the diagnosticity of information arriving
at different times was varied unconsciously.

Participants
55 undergraduate students from Indiana University participated in the experiment for course credit.

Stimuli
All stimuli for a given list were generated from two prototypes consisting of random consonant triads, displayed in
a triangular manner to minimize the effect of a left-to-right
reading preference, e.g., X L K and Z D J . An old item was made
from a prototype by replacing one of its letters with another
consonant. This resulted in 6 old items for each prototype (2
replacements each for the three letters) and a total of 12 old
items for study. The prototypes were not studied. New items
were generated in a similar manner by replacing a single prototype consonant with a new randomly selected consonant
that did not appear at study. This structure allows the sin-

Events—for example, the study of a memory list item—result
in the formation of a memory trace in long-term memory
(LTM). Both a memory trace and a memory probe consists
of a finite number of features, the number being determined
by short-term memory capacity limitations. Nx features arise
from the context in which the event occurs, for example, the
time, location, and internal state of the participant. These features are stable across all study and test trials. There are also
Nc content features which contain information about the event
itself. For example, the memory trace formed from studying
a word would include content features related to the word’s
spelling, phonology, and semantics. For the moment, we do
not specify the exact nature of each feature, nor do we assume
that the memory system “knows” whether a given feature is
a content or context feature. For simplicity, we assume that
all features are binary, e.g., “0” or “1”, with an equal prior
probability for each value.
In the full model, different kinds of events can be encoded with different kinds of features. For example, the
trace formed from studying a word will contain orthographic,
phonological, and semantic features while the trace formed
from studying a picture of a face will contain features relating to the shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, etc., and their relative positions. The low degree of featural overlap between
traces of different types means that probing with, for example, a word will not tend to activate traces of faces. In this
paper, all items in a given experiment are of the same type, so
this aspect of the model does not come into play.

gle unique consonant to be diagnostic as to whether an item
is old and new.

Procedure
The stimuli were presented centrally on a computer screen.
During the study phase, participants were instructed to study
the triads as they appeared on the screen and to remember
them for a later test of memory. Individual triads were presented in random order for 1 s each with a 1 s blank screen
between triads. During the test phase, the participants were
instructed to respond whether the presented triad came from
the previously studied list. Old and new responses were randomly mapped to the “A” or “L” key for each participant.
In the static condition, all letters became visible at the same
time. In the dynamic conditions, letters appeared sequentially
at a rate of 30 ms (below the threshold for conscious detection) and stayed on until the end of the trial. For new triads,
the unique consonant could appear as the first (diagnosticearly) or last (diagnostic-late) letter in the sequence. For
old triads, the non-prototype consonant could appear second
(diagnostic-early) or last (diagnostic-late). After a recognition judgment was made, the screen was cleared and the next
test trial began after 1 s.

Feature Sampling
Prior to the presentation of a test item, the only features
present in the probe are context features since those are persistent in the environment. Once a test item (or prime) is presented, content features may also enter the probe. We assume
that content features are sampled as a Poisson process, with
sampling events occurring at exponentially distributed intervals according to f (τ) = ρ1T exp(− ρτT ) at test with rate ρT
and rate ρS at study. On each sampling event, all the available
content features have an equal probability of being selected
for sampling. Whichever is selected, the correct value of the
feature is stored in the probe with probability c, otherwise a
random value is stored (in this case, either 0 or 1 with equal
probability).1 Note that, because all content features have an
equal probability of being sampled on each sampling event,
it is possible to sample a value for a feature that already has
a value in the probe. In that case, the most recently sampled
value replaces any previously stored value.
We assume that the same feature sampling process occurs
at study. The probability that an available content feature will
have a value stored, given limited study time Ts and sampling
rate ρS features per second, is 1 − (1 − 1/Nc )ρS Ts , which in-

Results
Observed hit rate (HR) and false alarm rate (FAR) are shown
in Figure 1A. FAR for dynamic-late is significantly lower
than for dynamic-early (t(54) = 2.73, p = 0.008) or static
presentation (t(54) = 3.42, p = 0.001), which are not significantly different from one another. HR does not differ significantly between conditions. RT for both hits and correct
rejections (CR; Figure 1B) is marginally slower in the dynamic conditions than static (for hits, t(51) = 2.04, p = 0.05;
for CR, t(53) = 2.06, p = 0.04), but otherwise does not differ
between conditions.

A Dynamic Model for Recognition
We now provide a technical description of a model that can
account for these effects of dynamic presentation. The model
given here is a further development of the one described by
Cox and Shiffrin (2012), although the present version is conceptually quite similar and is able to account for the same
effects as the original version.

1 The same noise process applies to context features; we simply
assume that all context features are sampled at once at the beginning
of the trial, rather than over time.

Making a Recognition Decision

creases with both ρS and Ts . While not all Nc content features
may end up being stored in a trace, we assume that all context
features have a stored value.

The raw familiarity φ(t) is not used directly to make a recognition decision, as its absolute value can fluctuate with a variety of factors that would preclude the setting of consistent
decision criteria (Cox & Shiffrin, 2012). Rather, changes
in log φ(t) are used to make a recognition decision2 . Positive changes in log φ(t) are evidence that the test item is old
while negative changes are evidence that the item is new.
The evidence state at time t, denoted B(t), is the accumulated change in log φ(t) since a given start time. If accumulation starts at t = 0, then B(t) = ∑tτ=1 log φ(τ) − log φ(τ − 1) =
log φ(t) − log φ(0).
When B(t) reaches criterion βO , an “old” response is made
and if it reaches βN , a “new” response is made. However, because at most Nc content features are available for sampling,
log φ(t) will reach a noisy asymptote. As a result, criteria
cannot be constant over time because, for some trajectories
of B(t), there is a non-zero probability that they will never
reach either criterion. Thus, we allow the decision bounds to
start at initial values β0O and β0N and gradually collapse ac

Comparison of Probe to Memory
At a given time t, the probe consists of a set of context features as well as whatever features of the test item have been
sampled by that time. The probe is compared to each trace in
LTM. These comparisons result in a set of likelihood ratios,
λi (t) for each trace i in LTM, reflecting the likelihood that the
probe and trace encode the same item versus the likelihood
that they encode different items (c.f., Shiffrin & Steyvers,
1997; McClelland & Chappell, 1998).
Likelihood The features of the probe and a memory trace
are aligned and compared individually. In the current restricted version of the model, the only features that affect
the likelihood are those in which a value is stored in both
the probe and trace, and the values either match or mismatch. For simplicity, we assume the same value of c at
study and test, so there are four ways a feature value might
match if the probe and trace encode the same item: the value
was correctly copied at both study and test (with probability
c2 ); a value was copied correctly at either study or test but
not the other and matches by chance (with total probability
c(1 − c)); or the value was copied incorrectly at both study
2

and test but still matches by chance (2 12 (1 − c) ). Summing these probabilities yields the probability of a feature
value match given that the probe and trace encode the same
item: Pr (M|Same) = c2 + c(1 − c) + 21 (1 − c)2 . Similarly, if
the probe and trace encode the same item, the stored values
could mismatch if the value in either the probe or the trace or
both were sampled incorrectly and failed to match by chance:
Pr (N|Same) = c(1−c)+ 12 (1−c)2 . If the probe and trace encode different events, then regardless of whether either value
were sampled correctly, they could only match or mismatch
by chance: Pr (M|Diff.) = Pr (N|Diff.) = 12 .
Since features are encoded independently of one another,
the likelihood ratio across all features is the product of the
likelihood ratios for the individual features. Letting NM (t)
and NN (t) be the number of feature value matches and mismatches, respectively, the relative likelihood that a probe and
trace encode the same versus different events is

Response Time Predictions
As is standard in RT modeling, we assume that the observed
response time arises from a decision component and a residual component, i.e., Tobs = TD + TR . The number of samples
needed to reach criterion determines the decision component
of the RT. If Ns samples are taken to reach criterion, then
because sampling is a homogeneous Poisson process, the decision time is a sample from a Gamma distribution with rate
ρT and shape Ns and expected value T̄D = ρT Ns .
The residual component of the RT is due to a number of
factors, including the time needed to execute the motor actions needed to make a response. TR may also vary with factors that affect the ability to successfully recognize a stimulus.
We do not yet model this process in detail; instead, because
we only predict mean RT in the studies reported here, we only
assume that the residual process has some stationary mean
value such that the mean predicted RT is T̄obs = T̄R + T̄D .

Model fitting
To fit the model to each experiment reported here, we first selected by hand a set of reasonable values for the key memory
parameters (Nc , Nx , c, and ρS ) and any experiment-specific
parameters. The remaining parameters—principally the initial decision bounds β0O and β0N , sampling rate at test ρT , and
mean residual time T̄R —were fit by minimizing the sum of
squared error to each available group data point (hit and FA

Familiarity Because the number of event traces in memory
is likely to be quite large, we assume that there is a threshold
for activation and only those traces whose likelihood ratios
are greater than this threshold contribute to familiarity. For
simplicity, we set this threshold equal to 1. The familiarity at
time t, φ(t), is the average likelihood ratio among the active
traces: φ(t) = hλi (t) : λi (t) > 1i.

2 The effect of the logarithm is simply to put positive and negative
changes on the same scale.

the one outlined above—would incorrectly predict an increase in FAs for the dynamic-late condition due to the increased probability of reaching βO (t) early on. A critical feature of our model, however, is that it accumulates changes
in familiarity, not absolute familiarity. If instead of accumulating log φ(t) − log φ(t − 1) from t = 0, accumulation began
when all features were available (at t = 2δ), the resulting evidence state would be B(t) = log φ(t) − log φ(2δ), as shown
in Figure 2B. This delay leads to predictions that match the
data: overall greater RT in the dynamic conditions, relatively
little difference in HR, and a marked decrease in FAR for the
dynamic-late condition (see Figure 1). The FAR prediction
arises because the first 2δ samples for a foil in the dynamiclate condition all tend to match the studied items, so ignoring
those early matching samples means that the later nonmatching samples are emphasized.
Why wait to begin accumulating changes? Although the
dynamic presentation was fast enough that participants could
not know which letters came on in what order, they could perceive that the display was noisy or “flickery”. Rationally, one
would not want to risk accumulating noise and so it makes
sense that participants would wait until the display was sufficiently clear to begin accumulating evidence for recognition
(e.g., Smith, Ratcliff, & Wolfgang, 2004). This kind of waiting is also analogous to discounting in short-term recognition (Huber, Shiffrin, Lyle, & Ruys, 2001), in that evidence is
down-weighted when it is attributed—perhaps erroneously—
to noise.

rates and mean RTs for each response type in each condition)
using the SIMPLEX algorithm from several different random
start points. As a result, we cannot claim that the fits reported
here are the best possible, but our aim is to demonstrate the
qualitative behavior of the model, rather than a strict quantitative fit.

Accounting For Experiment 1
We assume that the stimuli in Experiment 1 are represented
by a set of Nc content features, where N p features represent
each of the three consonants and Nw features represent their
configuration/conjunction (Nc = 3N p + Nw ). Within the 2 categories defined by a prototype, items share 2N p features (i.e.,
2 letters) but differ in their “diagnostic” (unique) letter and
configural features. Foils also share 2N p features with one of
the categories of studied items, but contain a third letter and
configural features that differ from all studied items. In the
static conditions, all Nc features are available to be sampled
from the beginning of the trial (t = 0). In the dynamic conditions, when the first letter appears (t = 0), only the N p features representing it are available for sampling into the probe.
When the second letter appears (t = δ), its features become
available for sampling as well. When the final letter appears
(t = 2δ), all content features— including the Nw configural
features—become available for sampling.
Because our interest is in explaining the qualitative patterns
in Experiment 1, and because a wide variety of parameter values are capable of producing such patterns, we arbitrarily let
N p = 5, Nw = 15, and δ = 10. Study time was fixed at TS = 1
second. With these parameter values, along with others given
in Table 1, the resulting mean value of log φ(t) for each condition is shown in Figure 2. All conditions reach the same
asymptotes, but take very different routes to get there. In
the early diagnostic condition, foil and target profiles separate widely early on, as would be expected, while in the late
diagnostic condition, both foils and targets produce increasing mean familiarity before dividing.
A static model that only used the asymptotic value of familiarity would, incorrectly, make the same predictions for all
three conditions. However, most dynamic models—including

Experiment 2: Fluency
It turns out that essentially the same mechanism—missing the
first few samples before beginning accumulation—can explain an apparently unrelated result in the recognition literature: the so-called “fluency effect”. It is based on the idea
that the subjective feeling of familiarity, rather than the presence or absence of a memory trace, leads one to decide that
an item is old, and that this feeling can arise from multiple
sources (Jacoby & Dallas, 1981). One such source is a “fluency heuristic” in which people detect the relative ease of perceptual processing of a test item and use this as a sign of past
experience. Jacoby and Whitehouse (1989) demonstrated that
old and new words preceded by a subliminal matching prime
increased the probability of judging a word as old. In terms
of fluency, the subliminal flash provides a head start in processing thereby increasing fluency and giving the illusion of
familiarity regardless of whether the word was old or new. We

present a replication of these results and show how a dynamic
model of recognition can account for them without appealing
to a fluency heuristic.

The stimuli were presented in lowercase letters in the center
of a computer monitor. In the study phase, participants were
instructed to read words aloud as they appeared on the screen
and to remember them for a later test of memory. The study
phase was divided into two blocks, one with words presented
for 1 s, another with words presented for 3 s (the order of the
blocks was randomized).
During the test phase, participants were instructed to respond whether the presented test word came from the study
list (“old”) or from the set of new words. Old and new responses were randomly mapped to the “A” or “L” key for
each participant. Each recognition test word was preceded
by a nondiagnostic subliminal prime: on 1/3 of trials, the
prime was identical to the test word, on another 1/3 of trials, the prime was a different word that had not been previously seen, and on another 1/3, the prime was a neutral
string of characters (XOXOXO). On each trial, a pre-mask
(&&&&&&&) was presented for 500 ms followed by a prime
(same, different, or neutral) for 50 ms and a post-mask for an
additional 500 ms. The screen went blank for 300ms before
the test word was presented. After the participant made a response, the screen was cleared for 1865 ms until the next test
trial. Participants were not informed that the primes would be
present.

but have no significant effect on RT for hits (t(80) = 0.93,
p = 0.35).

The Dynamic Account of Fluency
The core of our account of the fluency effect lies in the assumption that the prime, if it is a word, contributes some features to the probe before features begin to be sampled from
the test item and accumulation begins. In the case of an identical prime, this is exactly like changing the start time of accumulation in Experiment 1, since it eliminates the effects
of the first few samples, as shown in Figure 4. Notice that,
for both targets and foils, the first few samples in the neutral
prime condition will, on average, produce negative changes
in familiarity. If the prime word is identical to the subsequent
test item, “pre-loading” the first few features eliminates some
of these negative changes, making it harder to reach βN (t)
and increasing the probability of responding “old” for both
targets and foils.
The initial negativity for targets is a consequence of how
the set of activated traces changes over time as features accumulate in the probe, as outlined in Figure 5. Before any
content features are sampled, the probe contains only context features and the active traces tend to be those from recent

Results
Prior to analysis, trials with RT that were too fast (less than
200 ms) or too slow (longer than 3 s) were excluded (273
out of 14580 total trials). The observed mean probability
of responding “old” in each condition is shown in Figure
3A. Replicating the original result of Jacoby and Whitehouse
(1989), participants are significantly more likely to endorse
an item that was preceded by an identity prime than a neutral prime (t(80) = 12.0, p < 0.001). Surprisingly, they are
also more likely to endorse an item that was preceded by a
different prime than a neutral one (t(80) = 2.91, p = 0.005),
an effect also remarked on, but unexplained, in the original
work of Jacoby and Whitehouse (1989). Observed mean
correct RT are shown in Figure 3B. Identity primes speed
hits (t(80) = −10.7, p < 0.001), but slow CR (t(80) = 2.68,
p = 0.009) relative to neutral primes. Different primes also

Discussion
We have shown how a dynamic model of recognition that allows the start time of accumulation to vary independently of
feature sampling can account not just for the novel results of
our dynamic presentation study, but for older findings previously attributed to a fluency heuristic. Further, this model is
able to predict the observed positive priming from novel, different primes, a prediction made by no other extant recognition model. These seeming disparate predictions fall directly
out of the core feature of the model, namely, that it is changes
in familiarity from a given start time, not absolute familiarity,
that drive recognition decisions.
The model and these results thus illustrate the importance
of knowing when information for recognition becomes available. Here, we have assumed that unconscious priming and
dynamic presentation result in features being sampled before
changes get accumulated for recognition, but other manipulations (e.g., manipulations of salience or contrast) might
also influence the start time of accumulation, which would
be fruitful questions for further study. We suggested that, to
account for results in the different-prime condition in Experiment 2, responses are slowed by an increased difficulty in
recognizing the test word. Although this suggestion remains
to be formalized in a model, it emphasizes the need to consider all the possible processes that contribute to recognition.
Creating this kind of unified model requires a dynamic approach, which not only suggests new answers to issues like
fluency, but new questions.

experience, i.e., the study list. If just a few content features
are sampled, most or all list traces will remain active, even
though most will not match on content features. As an example, say you had studied the list “table”, “moon”, “parent”
and were shown “table” at test. If you had only sampled features of the first letter (“t”), they would only match 1 out of 3
study items. It is only after many content features have been
sampled (e.g., another several letters) that list traces that do
not match the target drop below the threshold for activation
and the match to the target trace takes precedence, raising the
average likelihood.
This kind of priming effect also operates for different
primes. Because the first few sampled features will not match
most of the list traces in any case, the features that leak from
a different prime will also tend to eliminate some initial negative changes, leading to an increased probability to say old to
both targets and foils. However, if the test word differs from
a prime word, this also impairs word recognition by introducing competition between the prime word and the test word
(McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981; Segui & Grainger, 1990).
If we assume that, as in Experiment 1, participants wait until
they have a clear percept before beginning accumulation, it is
reasonable to suggest that participants wait until this competition is resolved (i.e., they have a clear percept of the word)
before beginning accumulation. This takes some time, during which some of the prime features—which are no longer
being actively sampled or maintained—have a chance of deactivating and losing their sampled values, thereby separating
the different and same prime predictions.
In sum, we assume that each of the prime’s features has
a probability π of being sampled into the probe by the time
accumulation begins. There is a constant mean duration T̄C
required to resolve the competition during word recognition
in the different-prime condition, during which there is a probability η that any sampled prime feature will deactivate. The
features of the study and test words are assigned randomly.
We also assume that, because participants have prior experience with words, there are K traces of each word from life
history that can be activated at test (their context features
are assigned randomly; values used for these parameters are
given in Table 1). As shown in Figure 3C-D, the model predicts the canonical “fluency” finding of increased p(“Old”)
with an identical prime, as well as decreased RT for hits and
increased RT for CR. It also exhibits the observed small positive priming effect for different primes.
