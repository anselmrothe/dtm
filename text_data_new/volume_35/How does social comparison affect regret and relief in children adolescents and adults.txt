Abstract
Apprehending the development of complex emotions is
crucial to understand the development of decision-making.
Regret and relief are complex counterfactual emotions, which
can arise in private or in social contexts. The aims of the
present study were (i) to uncover the development of regret
and relief and (ii) to explore the development of a social form
of regret and relief in a context of competition. The first
experiment provides evidence that the ability to experience
regret and relief continues to develop until adolescence,
consistent with the implication of the orbitofrontal cortex in
their experience. In a context of competition, we observed
that adolescents were less able to experience social regret
compared to children and adults, whereas their feeling of
social relief was reinforced. Besides, adolescents failed to
question the appropriateness of their initial decision. This
result could provide an explanation for adolescents’ enhanced
propensity to engage in risky behaviours.

Introduction
Psychology and neuroscience studies have provided
converging evidence that emotions play a crucial role in
adaptive decision-making (Loewenstein, Rick & Cohen,
2008). Thus apprehending the development of basic and
complex emotions is crucial to fully understand the
development of decision-making. Among these emotions,
counterfactually mediated emotions – like regret and relief –
are related to counterfactual thinking and rely on
comparison processes. In a private context, these processes

rely on a comparison between what has happened and what
could have happened if the subject had made another choice
(Ritov, 1996). The counterfactual comparison has an
informative function, as it enables to determine a reference
point according to which the obtained outcome will be
evaluated. This process can also be motivated by the social
context. It will then rely on a comparison between what has
happened to the subject and what has happened to another
person, like a competitor, who made a different choice
(Bault, Coricelli & Rustichini, 2008).
To date, developmental psychology has mainly focused
on the development of counterfactually mediated emotions
in young children (Weisberg & Beck, 2010) showing that
the experience of regret develops around 5 years of age,
whereas the experience of relief develops around 7 years of
age. Recently, the development of regret and relief in
adolescence has been investigated in a probabilistic
gambling task (Burnett, Bault, Coricelli & Blakemore,
2010). Participants’ emotional ratings revealed that relief,
but not regret, develops during adolescence. The lack of
development of regret in adolescence is surprising given
that increasing feelings of regret and relief are positively
correlated with enhanced activity in the orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) that continues to mature until late adolescence
(Camille et al., 2004; Gogtay et al., 2004).
A possible explanation of the lack of evidence for the
development of regret in adolescence might relate to the
nature of the variables used to study this emotion. Previous
studies have focused primarily on emotional ratings.
Knowing that counterfactually mediated emotions are
related to participants’ decision and in order to fully

2464

apprehend these emotions, it was necessary to consider the
degree to which participants are willing to reconsider their
initial choice after experiencing regret (Chua, Gonzalez,
Taylor, Welsh, & Liberzon, 2009).

between the outcomes was unfavourable to the participant)
or relief (in the opposite case).

Experiment 1 – Private context
Aims and Hypotheses. Thus, the aim of the first
experiment was to uncover the development of regret and
relief in late childhood, adolescence and adulthood.
In order to do so, participants performed a child friendly
gambling task adapted from Camille et al. (2004). We asked
participants to choose between two wheels of fortune that
differed in the amount of gain and loss expected and the
probability of winning. We manipulated the outcome of the
wheel of fortune that was not selected by the participants to
induce either regret or relief. For each trial, participants
rated how they felt about the outcome and their willingness
to modify their choice, on a classical likert-type scale.
As the OFC has a fundamental role in the experience of
regret, and given the late maturation of this brain area, we
expect to observe a progressive development of the
emotional experience of counterfactually mediated emotions
from childhood to adulthood, in the private context.
Besides, the choice rating could be a more sensitive measure
in order to study the developmental trajectories and
understand the complexity of regret and relief.

Figure 1: Experimental design of a trial inducing regret.
Two ‘wheels of fortune’ were displayed on the computer
screen (1.a.). After the participant’s choice (1.b.),
participants were informed of obtained outcome (partial
feedback – 1.c.). Then the participant must rate an
‘emotional’ scale (1.d.) and a ‘choice’ scale (1.e.). Finally,
participants were informed of the complete feedback (1.f.)
and had to rate again an ‘emotional’ scale (1.g.) and a
‘choice’ scale (1.h.).

Method
Participants. In this private context, we recruited 53
volunteers: 19 children (mean age = 11.2 years, SD = 0.66),
17 adolescents (mean age = 14.5 years, SD = 0.40) and 17
university psychology students (mean age = 20.2 years, SD
= 1.48).
Written parental consent was obtained for children and
adolescents prior to the assessment session. Participants
were tested in accordance with international norms
governing the use of human research participants.
Experimental Procedure. Participants performed 36 trials
of a child friendly gambling task (cf. fig. 1). For each trial,
participants chose between two wheels of fortune, an
advantageous wheel (with a positive expected value) and an
attractive but disadvantageous wheel (with a negative
expected value). Then, two feedbacks, partial and complete
feedbacks, were successively provided to participants.
For the partial feedback, the outcome obtained on the
selected wheel was displayed on the screen for 4 s (fig. 1.c.).
Thus, the partial feedback induced either disappointment (in
the case of losses) or elation (in the case of gains). For the
complete feedback, participants were informed of the
outcome of the alternative wheel for 4 s (fig. 1.f). They
could thus compare the obtained outcome to the
counterfactual outcome. The complete feedback was
designed to induce either regret (when the comparison

After each feedback, participants rated a 7-point
‘emotional’ scale (fig. 1.d. and 1.g.), ranging from 1 (I am
unhappy) to 7 (I am happy). Participants then rated a 7-point
‘choice’ scale (fig. 1.e. and 1.f.), ranging from 1 (I wish to
modify my choice) to 7 (I do not wish to modify my
choice), on which they indicated how much they wished to
reconsider their choice.

Results
Participants’ ratings were analysed in four outcome
conditions: (a) low loss vs. high loss condition, which
should induce minimal relief; (b) low win vs. high win
condition, inducing minimal regret; (c) low win vs. high
loss condition, inducing maximal relief; and (d) low loss vs.
high win condition, inducing maximal regret.
For the ‘emotional’ and ‘choice’ ratings analyses, we
computed difference scores (see Weisberg & Beck, 2010).
Ratings on the partial feedback were subtracted from ratings
on the complete feedback. Thus, the emotional and choice
scores ranged between -6 and +6. We carried out onesample t-tests to determine whether both scores differed
from zero. A negative emotional score would suggest that
participants experienced regret whereas a positive emotional
score would suggest that participants experienced relief. A

2465

negative choice score would suggest that participants
wanted to modify their initial choice whereas positive
choice score would suggest that participants want to
maintain their initial choice.
A 3 (age: children vs. adolescents vs. adults) x 4
(outcomes: maximal regret, minimal regret, maximal relief,
minimal relief) mixed-design ANOVA on the ‘emotional’
scores revealed that these scores differed between the three
groups of participants, F(2,50) = 3.24, p < .05, ηp2 = .12, and
between the type of outcomes, F(3,50) = 57.95, p < .001, ηp2
= .54. The age of the participants affected the emotional
scores differently in the four types of outcomes, F(6,150) =
2.73, p < .05, ηp2 = .10. In the minimal regret condition,
children and adolescents’ average emotional scores were
lower than adult scores, t(34) = -1.60, p = .056, d = .72 for
children and t(32) = -1.59, p = .052, d = .72 for adolescents.
Similarly, in the maximal regret condition, children and
adolescents’ emotional scores were lower than adult scores,
t(34) = -2.41, p < .01, d = .70 for children and t(32) = -3.47,
p < .001, d = 1.75 for adolescents (cf. fig. 2). No other
differences were significant.
To sum up, all participants experienced regret in the
conditions designed to induce this emotion, but children and
adolescents’ subjective experience of regret was reduced
compared to adults. Besides, although all groups reported
relief in the condition designed to induce maximal relief,
children and adolescents did not experience relief when they
lost a small amount of money but avoided losing a higher
amount, t(18) < 1 and t(16) = 2,39, p = .09 respectively.

Figure 2: ‘Emotional’ ratings for the private context –
mean scores (partial feedback ratings subtracted from
complete feedback ratings) for regret and relief trials.
Ratings were analysed according to four types of outcome
(minimal relief, minimal regret, maximal relief and maximal
regret). We compared regret and relief scores to zero (onesample t-tests with zero as the test value, Bonferronicorrected, *p < .05, ** p < .005, ***p < .001).
The 3 (age) x 4 (type of outcome) mixed-design ANOVA
on the ‘choice’ scores revealed a main effect of the type of
outcome, F (3,150) = 36.7, p < .001, ηp2 = .42, but no main
effect of age, F(2,50) = 2.87, p = .07. Interestingly, the
interaction between age and outcome was significant, F
(6,150) = 2.54, p < .05, ηp2 =.09. Planned comparisons of
the ‘choice scores’ revealed that children were less willing
to modify their initial choice than were adolescents, t(34) =

-2.41, p < .01, d = .66, and adults, t(34) = -3.00, p < .005, d
= 1.23, in the minimal regret (win-win) condition. Similarly,
in the maximal regret (loss-win) condition, children were
less willing to modify their initial choice than were adults,
t(34) = -1.70, p < .05, d = .61. No other differences were
significant.
As expected, adults wished to modify their initial choice
in the conditions inducing regret, t(16) = -5.43, p < .001 in
the minimal regret condition and, t(16) = -4.55, p < .001 in
the maximal regret condition. On the contrary, they wished
to maintain their initial choice in the conditions inducing
relief, t(16) = 4.23, p < .005 in the minimal relief condition
and, t(16) = 4.74 p < .001 in the maximal relief condition.
As opposed to adults, children did not wish to modify their
choice in the minimal regret condition, t(18) = 1.03, p > .1,
even if they experienced a significant feeling of regret.

Discussion
Analyses of the ‘emotional’ scores revealed developmental
differences for both types of counterfactually mediated
emotions (regret and relief). All participants experienced
regret in the two outcome conditions designed to induce this
emotion, but children and adolescents’ subjective
experience of regret was reduced compared to adults.
Our results are consistent with the ones reported in a
recent study (Rafetseder & Perner, 2012) showing that
regret develops progressively from childhood to adulthood
and reaches its maximum level in the adult group.
The fact that children experienced relief after a small gain
(maximal relief condition) but not after a small loss
(minimal relief condition) might suggest that this group has
difficulties distinguishing between two outcomes that both
lead to a loss and thus might focus more on the loss they
obtained rather than on the high loss they avoided (see
Weisberg & Beck, 2012 for similar results).
Moreover, analyses of the ‘choice’ scores demonstrate that
regret affects the participant’s willingness to reconsider their
initial choice in adults, whereas it does not systematically
lead to a reconsideration of the initial choice in children.
Adults wished to modify their initial choice in the
conditions inducing regret but wished to maintain their
initial choice in the conditions inducing relief. As opposed
to adults, children and adolescents expressed no preference
about modifying their choice in the condition inducing
minimised relief.
Finally, we identified a dissociation in children between
the experience of regret and the willingness to reconsider an
initial choice, in the minimal regret condition (low win vs.
high win condition) specifically. In this condition, the
salience of the counterfactual alternative might be reduced
as participants have already won on the selected wheel.
When the obtained outcome is already good for them, it
seems difficult for children to think counterfactually, to take
in account the alternative win and then expressing their wish
to modify their choice.

Experiment 2 – Social context
Our first experiment provided evidence that the ability to
experience regret and relief continues to develop during late
childhood and adolescence.
As little is known about adolescents’ sensibility to
complex negative emotions, we were particularly interested
in the emotional experience of regret in adolescents. It has
actually been demonstrated that the anticipation of complex
negative emotions – such as regret – can significantly
contribute to decrease risky behaviours in adolescents
(Conner, Sandberg, McMillan, & Higgins, 2006; Richard,
Van Der Pligt, & De Vries, 1996). Indeed, studies focusing
on the role of anticipated regret in risky decision making
have revealed that inciting adolescents to anticipate the
regret they could experience after a risky behaviour can
significantly decrease the intentions to engage in this
behaviour.
In order to apprehend risky decision making in
adolescence, neurobiological models have postulated the
existence of two distinct brain systems involved in decision
making: a cognitive control system - supporting goaldirected decisions through the ability to inhibit impulsive
behaviour - and a socio-emotional system - based on the
valuation and prediction of potential rewards, that can bias
decision (Chein, Albert, O’Brien, Uckert, & Steinberg,
2011; Sommerville, Jones & Casey, 2010). These models
posit an imbalance between the maturity of adolescents’
socio-emotional system and the relative immaturity of the
cognitive control system (Sommerville, et al., 2010). Due to
this imbalance, adolescents are hypersensitive to rewards,
particularly in salient socio-emotional contexts (Chein et al.,
2011; Ernst et al., 2005). This kind of context selectively
increases adolescents’ sensitivity to potential rewards,
which could explain why adolescence corresponds to a
period of greater risk seeking in everyday life (Chein et al.,
2011).
However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the
impact of a salient socio-emotional context on adolescents’
experience of regret and relief. Yet, in everyday life,
adolescents not only experience these emotions alone but
also in social contexts – e.g., in school, when they compare
their achievements with those of their schoolmates.
Aims and Hypotheses. Thus, the aim of this second
experiment was to explore the development of a social form
of regret and relief in adolescents, compared to children and
adults. Social regret was defined as the negative emotion
that one feels when he has missed an opportunity while
another person has seized it and social relief as the opposite
feeling.
In the socio-emotional context condition, participants were
additionally informed that they would be playing against a
schoolmate and that their results would be compared to
those of the other player throughout the game.
We hypothesized that adolescents should be more
influenced by the social context of competition than
children and adults (Chein et al., 2011). If adolescents are

hypersensitive to the emotional context, compared to adults
and children, they should demonstrate a heightened
sensitivity to the gains they obtain and their evaluation of
social relief should be biased. Therefore, adolescents should
experience an enhanced feeling of social relief. In addition,
if the social context also influences negative complex
emotions, they should experience a decreased feeling of
social regret compared to children and adults. Thus, their
willingness to reconsider an initial choice should be
attenuated compared to the other groups.

Method
Participants. In the social context, we recruited 54
volunteers: 18 children (mean age = 11.8 years, SD = 0.43),
18 adolescents (mean age = 14.5 years, SD = 0.40) and 18
university students (mean age = 20.2 years, SD = 1.48).
Written parental consent was obtained for children and
adolescents prior to the assessment session. Participants
were tested in accordance with international norms
governing the use of human research participants.
Experimental Procedure. Participants performed 36 trials
of the computerized child friendly gambling task used in
experiment 1. The procedure and the stimuli of the
gambling task were the same as in experiment 1.
However, in order to induce social regret and social relief,
children and adolescents were informed that that they would
be playing against a schoolmate and adults were told that
they will be playing against another student of the same age
and the same institute. We additionally informed
participants that all of their choices would be compared to
those of their competitor. Thus, the complete feedback
informed the participants about the outcome obtained by
their competitor, so that they could compare it to their own
outcome.

Results
Participants’ ratings were again analysed according to four
outcome conditions: (a) low loss vs. high loss condition,
which should induce minimal relief; (b) low win vs. high
win condition, inducing minimal regret; (c) low win vs.
high loss condition, inducing maximal relief; and (d) low
loss vs. high win condition, inducing maximal regret.
Besides, we computed difference scores for the ‘emotional’
and ‘choice’ ratings analyses (cf. experiment 1).
A 3 (age) x 4 (outcome conditions) mixed-design
ANOVA conducted on ‘emotional’ scores revealed a main
effect of age, F(2,51) = 12.64, p < .001, ηp2 = .33, a main
effect of outcome condition, F(3,153) = 51.01, p < .001, ηp2
= .50, and a significant interaction between age and
outcome condition, F(6,153) = 2.36, p < .05, ηp2 = .08.
Planned comparisons revealed that in the minimal social
relief condition, adolescents’ social relief was higher than
that expressed by children, F(1,51) = 12.98, p < .001, d =
1.19 (cf. fig. 3). No other differences were significant.

2467

Figure 3: ‘Emotional’ ratings for the social context –
mean scores on regret and relief conditions. Ratings were
analysed according to four types of outcome (minimal
relief, minimal regret, maximal relief and maximal regret).
We compared regret and relief scores to zero (one-sample ttests with zero as the test value, Bonferroni-corrected, * p <
.05, ** p < .005, *** p < .001).
Notably, adolescents expressed lower social relief in the
maximal relief condition compared to the minimal social
relief condition, F(1,51) = 6.18, p < .05, d = 0.71. In the
maximal social regret condition, adolescents expressed less
regret than children, t(51) = 2.60, p < .05, d = 0.82, and
adults, t(51) = 3.51, p < .001, d = 1.34. Beside, planned
comparisons in this condition also revealed a significant
quadratic trend between age and the expression of regret,
revealing a U-shaped developmental pattern, F(1,51) =
12.46, p < .001, and no significant linear trend, F < 1. These
results suggest that adolescents experience less social regret
than children and adults in the maximal social regret
condition.
A 3 (age) x 4 (outcomes) mixed-design ANOVA
conducted on ‘choice’ scores revealed that these scores
differed between the type of outcome, F(3,153) = 22.21, p <
.001, ηp2 = .30, but not between the three age groups,
F(2,51) = 1.13, p = .33. Interestingly, the age of the
participants affected the choice scores differently in the four
outcome conditions, F(6,153) = 2.67, p < .05, ηp2 = .09.
The willingness to maintain the initial choice was lower in
the maximal social relief condition compared to the minimal
social relief condition for adolescents and adults, t(51) =
2.12, p < .05, d = 0.63 and t(51) = 3.51, p < .005, d = 0.83,
respectively. Adolescents were less willing to modify their
choice in the maximal social regret condition than in the
minimal social regret condition, F(1,51) = 9.52, p < .01, d =
0.67, and than adults, F(1,51) = 5.33, p < .05, d = 0.83.

Discussion
The results of this experiment evidenced that a salient socioemotional context of competition impacts the feeling of
regret and relief, specifically in adolescents. Critically,
when adolescents obtained an initial negative outcome, their
feeling of social relief was reinforced, compared to children
and adults. Adolescents were actually far more relieved after
obtaining an initial loss (minimal social relief) than after
obtaining an initial win (maximal social relief). Given that
the only difference between the minimal and maximal social

relief conditions was the presence of an initial loss in the
minimal social relief condition, this result may suggest that
a salient context of social competition has a direct impact on
adolescents’ sensitivity to losses, increasing the feeling of
relief when the competitor obtained a greater loss.
On the other hand, adolescents’ feeling of social regret
was considerably attenuated compared to children and
adults. Theoretically, the condition of maximal social regret
should have the greatest effect on participants’ self-esteem.
However, even if adolescents are able to experience regret
(cf. experiment 1 and Burnett et al., 2010), they did not
express a significant feeling of regret in the maximal regret
condition. Thus, we argue that this specific lack of social
regret in adolescents may be a consequence of a heightened
sensitivity to negative outcomes in a social context.
Interestingly, this weaker tolerance to losses leads
adolescents to down-regulate their feeling of social regret
and their willingness to reconsider their choice. As such,
when adolescents obtain a negative outcome, they fail to
question the appropriateness of their initial decision. This
result is in line with studies that revealed a relative deficit in
adolescents’ ability to tolerate and to learn from negative
outcomes compared to adults (Aïte, et al., 2012; Cassotti,
Houdé & Moutier, 2011).
Our findings indicate that adolescents are not only
hypersensitive to rewards but also to losses in salient socioemotional contexts by demonstrating that the socioemotional context of competition significantly impacts their
feeling of social regret and of social relief after an initial
loss. These results are in line with the proposition of an
imbalance between the socio-emotional system and the
cognitive control system in adolescence (Chein et al., 2011;
Sommerville et al., 2010).

General Discussion
The aims of this paper were to (i) to examine the
development of regret and relief from childhood to
adulthood and (ii) to explore the development of the ability
to experience social regret and social relief in adolescents
compared to children and adults in a context of social
competition.
The results of the first experiment provide evidence that
the ability to experience counterfactually mediated emotions
– regret and relief – is attenuated in children and adolescents
compared to adults. This result is consistent with the
implication of the OFC in the experience of regret and relief
(Camille et al., 2004).
Moreover, we observed that regret affects the participant’s
willingness to reconsider their initial choice in adults,
whereas it does not systematically lead to the same
reconsideration in children. We actually identified that the
experience of regret and the willingness to reconsider an
initial choice can be dissociated in children. This result may
indicate a developmental dissociation between feeling and
doing that has previously been observed among participants
of the same age range (Cassotti et al., 2011).

The results from the choice scale reveal the importance of
using both ‘emotional’ and ‘choice’ ratings to study the
precise development of counterfactually mediated emotions
such as regret and relief.
The results of the second experiment is the first to
evidence that a salient socio-emotional context of
competition impacts the feeling of counterfactually
mediated emotions – regret and relief – specifically in
adolescents. Critically, when adolescents obtained an initial
negative outcome, their feeling of social regret was
considerably attenuated compared to children and adults,
whereas their feeling of social relief was reinforced. The
present results suggest that in a social comparison context,
adolescents are less able to experience social regret and fail
to question the appropriateness of their initial decision,
particularly when another person (a competitor) has
obtained a higher outcome by choosing differently.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present paper evidenced that the ability to
experience regret and relief continues to develop in late
childhood and adolescence.
This paper is also the first to evidence that a salient socioemotional context of competition can impact the feeling of
regret and relief, specifically in adolescents.
Finally, the present results suggest that in a social
comparison context, adolescents are less able to experience
social regret and fail to question the appropriateness of their
initial decision. Thus, this result could provide an
explanation for adolescents’ enhanced propensity to engage
in risky behaviours in everyday life.
