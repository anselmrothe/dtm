have to be done under uncertain circumstances. Often, the
decision makers express their beliefs using verbal
probabilities such as “probable” or “possible”. There is a
risk of miscommunication because of the considerable
variation of people’s interpretation of the meaning of
linguistic terms (LTs) (e.g., Karelitz & Budescu, 2004).
Further, misunderstandings may lead to wrong decisions
with undesirable consequences. Therefore, avoiding
misunderstandings
and
improving
interpersonal
communication is highly relevant in a globalized world.
The present paper highlights the questions (1) if LTs
(probability expressions) of different languages (Spanish vs.
German) are interpreted differently by native speakers and
(2) whether there exists a cultural influence on the LTs
interpretation, namely, concerning the dimension of
uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede, 1980). Methodologically,
we use fuzzy membership functions (MFs) to formalize and
compare the vague meaning of the LTs (e.g., Bocklisch,
Bocklisch & Krems, 2012).

Abstract
In times of globalization, differences between cultures and in
the interpretation of linguistic terms can lead to
misunderstanding in communication. The present study
focuses on the influence of cultural dimensions, especially
uncertainty avoidance, on the interpretation of verbal
probability expressions. It is hypothesized that uncertainty
avoidance has an effect on the interpretation of uncertainty
expressions. Therefore, Spanish and German participants
were asked (1) for uncertainty avoidance and (2) to estimate
numerical equivalents for 12 verbal probability expressions
(e.g., possible). The estimation data were modeled using
fuzzy membership functions. Results neither show differences
in uncertainty avoidance nor in the interpretation of the
probability expressions between these two languages.
Possible reasons and future research perspectives are
discussed.
Keywords: Uncertainty Avoidance, Linguistic Terms,
Probability Expressions, Fuzzy Membership Functions.

Culture and Language

Introduction
In times of the most severe economic crisis the European
Union ever experienced the following situation is likely to
happen: Imagine economic experts from Spain and
Germany discussing about the risk of a financial breakdown
of Spain’s banks in the near future: Expert 1 argues: “I am
sure that we will have a crash next year.” and expert 2
responds: “It’s possible but I am still optimistic. Probably
we can manage it.” In many social interactions between
persons or groups of different countries the language for
communication might not be the native language of the
speakers (e.g., Spanish or German) but a foreign one (such
as English). Nevertheless, one is likely to “think” in terms
of the own language, choose words that express the own
intention best and then “translate” them into the foreign
language. But given the vagueness of natural languages
(e.g., Teigen & Brun, 2003; Budescu, Karelitz & Wallsten,
2003; Bocklisch, Bocklisch & Krems, 2010; 2012) and
potential cultural differences (e.g., Hofstede, 1980; 2001;
Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov, 2010) we can not
necessarily be sure that the translation reflects the meaning
precisely and therefore, communication partners may
misunderstand each other. The example described above is
prototypical for situations in which forecasts and decisions

One influential paradigm in intercultural research is
Hofstedes model of cultural differences. In its original form
(Hofstede, 1980), he differentiated four cultural dimensions
on which cultures vary and, therefore, may be compared:
individualism/collectivism, power distance, uncertainty
avoidance and masculinity/femininity. Concerning the
investigation of probability expressions, we consider the
third dimension “uncertainty avoidance” (UA) as especially
interesting and, therefore, focus on UA in the following. In
short, UA is determined by the extent to which members of
a society become nervous or insecure about situations that
seem to be unpredictable, unstructured and uncertain.
There are already evidences that culture and language are
important concerning the interpretation of LTs, for instance,
Doupnik and Richter (2003) already found differences in the
interpretation of German and English uncertainty
expressions between native speaking auditors in two cultural
areas, namely, America and Germany. We will focus on two
languages, Spanish and German, which developed in the
same European cultural region. According to Hofestede
(2001), Spain and Germany are both countries with high UA
values and, at the same time, differ remarkably in UA
(UASpain > UAGermany). In our study we (1) expect to replicate
Hofstedes results and find high UA scores for both

1917

languages as well as significant differences. Furthermore,
we hypothesize that the probability expressions should be
interpreted differently. We expect that because the context
seems to influence the meaning of expressions (e.g., Weber
& Hilton, 1990). We think that culture may be determined
as a very global form of context. Therefore, if the scores of
UASpain ≠ UA Germany the LTs might also be interpreted
differently.

Such intuitive understanding is also advantageous when
an estimation method is used for participants not highly
trained in estimation tasks. For more details concerning the
theoretical justification or parameter estimation see
Bocklisch (1987) or Bocklisch, Groß, Bocklisch and Krems
(submitted).

Numerical Translation of Linguistic Terms

Participants

To determine the meaning of LTs researchers have
developed procedures for the numerical translation of verbal
expressions (e.g., Simpson, 1944; Beyth-Marom, 1982;
Budescu, Karelitz & Wallsten, 2003; Bocklisch, Bocklisch
& Krems, 2010; 2012). Generally, results of these studies
show (1) that mean estimates for linguistic expressions are
similar and that they have stable meaning (Simpson, 1944
and Hakel, 1968). At the same time there exists large interindividual variability in the interpretation of verbal
expressions (for reviews see Pepper, 1981; Teigen & Brun,
2003). Another important outcome is (2) that fuzzy set
theory (Zadeh, 1965) proved especially useful for describing
the vague meaning of LTs by modelling them using fuzzy
MFs (e.g., Zimmer, 1984; Budescu & Wallsten, 1995;
Budescu et al., 2003, Bocklisch et al., 2012).
We used the two-step translation procedure outlined in
Bocklisch et al. (2012) for the numerical translation of the
probability expressions. This procedure also uses fuzzy MFs
to model the empirical estimates of participants. MFs are
truth value functions. In this study, the membership value
(μ) represents the degree of truth that a numerical estimate
fulfils a specific criterion represented by a LT (e.g., the
numerical probability “in 70 of 100 cases” belongs to the
linguistic probability expression probable). We use a
standardized μ ranging from 0 (no membership) to 1 (full
membership). Furthermore, the procedure has been proven
useful for the translation of LTs (e.g., probability
expressions: Bocklisch et al., 2010; symptom intensities in
medical contexts: Bocklisch, Stephan, Wulfken, Bocklisch
& Krems, 2011; and frequency expressions: Bocklisch et al.,
2012), and as basis for evaluating and choosing verbal
response labels for questionnaire scales (e.g., for the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) see Bocklisch, Bocklisch
& Krems 2011). It includes (1) an empirical estimation
method in which participants assign typical, minimum and
maximum correspondence numbers to presented words, and
(2) a fuzzy approach for the analysis of data and the
generation of MFs – specifically, parametric MFs of the
potential type. This procedure is very efficient as only three
numerical values are estimated, and is easily understood
because the semantic meaning of estimation points is
implicitly clear to participants (e.g., minimum and
maximum correspondence values = borders of LTs
meanings). Semantic comprehensibility, as such, makes
participants’ estimates understandable even if they have no
theoretical knowledge of the concept of fuzzy membership.

We collected data of 147 German participants (51 males)
with an average age of 27.5 (SD = 9.9) and 21 Spanish
participants (12 males) with a mean age of 34.8 (SD =
12.9). All subjects were native speakers. Four (German
sample) vs. one (Spanish sample) persons were raised
bilingual. Most of the participants were students and the
German students received course credits for participation.

Method

Design, Material and Procedure
The study was quasi-experimental employing an online
questionnaire in two languages (Spanish vs. German). The
material was carefully constructed to make sure that both
questionnaire versions were equivalent in meaning,
especially concerning the 12 probability expressions (see
Table 1) that were presented in the questionnaire in a
random order. The 12 LTs were chosen from a pool of 47
probability expressions gained from a literature review and
dictionaries. These 12 words are rather unambiguous in
meaning and are frequently used in both languages. The
translation from German to Spanish was done independently
by two Spanish that also speak German very well
(international C1 and B2 level). The questionnaire had four
main parts: (1) a short introduction, (2) the estimation part
for the translation of the probability expressions (Bocklisch
et al., 2012), (3) the uncertainty avoidance scale including
ten items (e.g., “I would like to have more control about the
future.”) (Mealy, Stephan, Abalakina-Paap, 2006; see also
Fahmie, 2012) and (4) a few questions concerning
demographic data.

Results
Uncertainty Avoidance
We found UA scores of MGerman = 38.8 (SDGerman = 7.0) and
MSpanish= 39.5 (SDSpanish= 5.8) and, therefore, no significant
differences (t(166) = -.425, p = 0.67).

Meaning of Linguistic Terms
The results for the meanings of LTs are structured starting
with descriptive statistics of the data, and then the fuzzy
MFs and discriminatory power values (dp) indicating how
similar the MFs and, hence, the meaning of the LTs are. As
outlined in Bocklisch et al. (2012, p.148), we present
descriptive statistics and MFs for purposes of completeness
and comparison, even though we believe that MFs are more
suitable for describing the meaning of vague LTs. We have

to emphasize that statistical and fuzzy analyses are two
approaches that should be understood independently,
because fuzzy MFs, by definition, do not refer to probability
theory and statistics. Although some parameters of our MF
type can be interpreted statistically (e.g., representative
values (r) = the arithmetic mean), a MF is not a probability
density function and conventional requirements (i.e., the
integral of the variable’s density is equal to 1) are not valid.
Descriptive Statistics. Table 1 shows a comparison of the
descriptive statistics (i.e., means and standard deviations)
for the Spanish and German LTs. The minimal and maximal
estimates were used for modelling of the MFs and are not
reported here.
The order of the means of the typical estimates (equals r
of the MFs, see below) presented in Table 1 is the same for
the Spanish and German LTs and even the numerical values
are very similar. The largest difference is 12.5 for probable.

(MFs shapes) in both languages. For instance, the MFs for
possible (MF 7) are almost congruent.
Furthermore, we find the same pattern as reported in
Bocklisch et al. (2010 and 2012) that MFs of LTs at the
scales borders (e.g., impossible) are smaller in extent and,
therefore, more precise in meaning compared to mid-scale
LTs (e.g., possible). MFs 8 and 12 (probable and certain)
show the largest differences. This is also confirmed by the
dps (see Table 1). For MFs 12 (certain) dp = 0.71 reaches
the threshold of a remarkable difference while all other dps
are smaller than 0.5.

Discussion
Fuzzy Membership Functions. Figure 1 shows the
potential MF for both the German and Spanish probability
expressions. The MFs’ peaks (marked with a vertical line),
indicating the highest membership (r), are identical to the
means shown in Table 1. Dps of the MFs are shown in
Table 1. According to Bocklisch et al. (2012; p.149), dp
values are defined by the overlapping area of two MFs and
is standardized by taking values between 0 (MFs are
identical) and 1 (no overlap at all). By definition, the larger
the overlap, the smaller the dp, and the more similar the
meanings of the verbal expressions are. Concerning the
interpretation of dp, values ≥ 0.7 suggest that the MFs are
considerably different (because overlap is <30%).
For reasons of clarity and comprehensibility, the LTs with
odd numbers are shown in the upper part and even numbers
in the lower part of Figure 1. The MFs positions and shapes
show that the meaning of a certain LT is highly similar
regarding its typical meaning (rs) as well as vagueness

The results show that there is (1) no significant difference in
the UA between Spanish and German participants. Hence,
we could replicate only parts of Hofstedes results (Hofstede,
2001): Spain and Germany are both countries with high UA.
But our results do not show remarkable differences between
Spain and Germany in UA as we hypothesized according to
Hofstede (2001). Concerning (2) the interpretation of
probability expressions we did not find differences in the
MFs between the Spanish and German sample except for LT
certain and, by tendency, for probable. This is a surprise
because we did not expect that the MFs of the Spanish and
German LTs are so similar because the languages do not
origin from the same language family. But in regard to the
cultural background it seems reasonable and goes along
with the idea that UA and interpretation of probability LTs
may be connected. For future studies we suggest to collect
data from a more representative sample. Especially the
Spanish sample of this study was rather small.
