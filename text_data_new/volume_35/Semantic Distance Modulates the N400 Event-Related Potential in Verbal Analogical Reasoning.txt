Four-term verbal analogies have long been used as both a
standard measure of intelligence and vocabulary knowledge.
According to traditional accounts of analogical processing,
to solve this type of problem the reasoner needs to (1)
retrieve word meanings from semantic memory, (2) bind
words into explicit abstract relations in working memory,
and (3) perform a mapping in working memory between
corresponding sets of words in the source and target. For
instance, to verify the analogy:

Abstract
Computational accounts have traditionally focused on
mapping between structured representations as fundamental
to analogical processing. However, a recent connectionist
model has been used to argue that structured representations
may not be necessary to solve verbal analogies. Green and
colleagues (2010) have shown that brain areas associated with
analogical mapping become more engaged as semantic
distance increases between verbal analogy source and targets.
Herein, we had participants verify verbal analogies
characterized for semantic distance while we monitored their
brain waves using EEG. Our results suggest that the semantic
distance between the source and target of a verbal analogy
does influence early semantic processing as reflected in the
N400 Event-Related Potential. However, successfully
differentiating valid and invalid verbal analogies engages
areas of prefrontal cortex widely associated with inhibitory
processing and the integration of abstract relations in working
memory. Thus, it appears that traditional semantic priming
alone is likely insufficient to explain the full extent of
analogical processing.

animal : zoo :: person : house
participants may (1) retrieve the meanings of the words
animal, zoo, person, and house, (2) bind housed (animal),
lived-in (zoo), housed (person), and lived-in (house) (3) and
then map lives-in (animal, zoo) to lives-in (person, house)
specifically discovering that animal analogically maps to
person and zoo maps to house. Several researchers have
used this type of approach as embodied in the LISA model
(Hummel & Holyoak, 1997; 2003) to account for patterns of
verbal analogy performance (Morrison et al., 2004; Michael
Vendetti & Knowlton & Holyoak, 2012).
In contrast, recent connectionist models of analogy
(Leech, Mareschal & Cooper, 2008) have proposed that
four-term verbal analogies may be solved without the use of
structured relations via a mechanism utilizing guided pattern
completion in semantic memory. Contrary to previous
accounts of analogical priming (Spellman, Holyoak, &
Morrison, 2001), Leech and colleagues argue that this
mechanism of analogy could occur automatically without
the use of explicitly represented relations and analogical
mapping.
In addition to many experimental studies (see Holyoak &
Hummel, 2008) the former traditional relationally explicit
approach is supported by findings showing that solving
verbal analogies engages anterior regions of the PFC
(Bunge et al., 2005; Green et al., 2010) frequently
associated with processing abstract information (e.g.,
Christoff et al., 2009; Nikitin & Morrison, 2011; Volle et

Introduction
Analogical reasoning is fundamental to the way that
humans learn and reason in day-to-day life.. Likewise,
analogies have long been considered to be a core component
of analytic intelligence (Spearman, 1927) and of great
importance in learning and discovery (Holyoak & Thagard,
1995). For nearly a century, researchers in cognitive science
have developed theories and computational models to offer
potential mechanisms for analogical processing (French,
2002). More recently patient-based (Morrison et al., 2004;
Krawczyk et al., 2008) and functional neuroimaging studies
(e.g., Bunge et al. 2005; Bunge et al. 2009; Green et al.
2010; Krawczyk et al., 2010; Volle et al., 2010; Watson &
Chatterjee, 2012) have begun to identify a network of brain
areas, particularly the prefrontal cortex (PFC), essential for
analogical reasoning.

N400 is a negative ERP component that typically peaks
around 400ms after presentation of the stimulus. The N400
increases in negativity as a stimulus (usually a single word)
becomes more incongruous from its context (Kutas &
Federmeier, 2011). The N400 effect was first documented in
sentence processing. For example, the italicized word in the
sentence, “The cat will bake the food” will elicit a more
negative N400 relative to, “The cat will eat the food” (Kutas
& Hillyard, 1980). Many studies of language processing and
semantic processing have shown the N400 to be sensitive to
contextual semantic meaning (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011).
Subsequent work has shown that the N400 effect is elicited
in response to conceptual incongruities in other domains.
For example, incorrect answers to simple symbolic (e.g., “4
x 4 = 21”) and verbal (e.g., “Twelve plus three equals
sixteen.”) arithmetic problems elicit an N400 effect (e.g.,
Niedeggen & Rosler, 1999).
Importantly, this type of automatic semantic congruity
processing as measured by ERP methodology occurs earlier
in the time course of processing than structured comparisons
such as syntactic processing or analogical mapping. For
instance, a positive ERP component typically peaking
around 600ms after stimulus presentation (the P600) is
sensitive to violations of syntax within a sentence (e.g.,
“The student will studying the lecture the professor gave on
tuesday.”; Osterhout & Mobley, 1995). Likewise the P600
is also sensitive to violations in structure of music (Patel et
al., 1998). Likewise, Nikitin and Morrison (2011) found that
an ERP component linked to the comparison of relational
structures during visual analogical reasoning began
approximately 500 to 600ms post stimulus presentation,
once again after the N400.
To further explore the influence of semantic distance on
analogical reasoning, we recorded EEG while participants
solved sequentially presented four-term verbal analogy
problems (e.g. A:B::CD; see Figure 1) varying in the
semantic distance between the source (A:B) and target
(C:D) word pairs. Semantic distances between the first and
second word pairs were split into near (semantically similar)
and far (semantically less similar) analogies. We
hypothesized that near analogies would be more likely than
far analogies to be solved via automatic semantic priming
and thus the N400 ERP would be less negative for near than
far analogies.

Figure 1: (a) Trial timeline. Participants were instructed to
think of how the A:B were related and then decide whether
the C:D pair was related in the same way. Calculated ERPs
were time-locked to presentation of the C:D pair. (b) C:D
pairs were used for all four conditions across four blocks of
trials. Valid and invalid problems were matched for
semantic distance using LSA for both near and far
conditions.
al., 2010) and explicit relational integration (e.g., Bunge et
al., 2009; Nikitin & Morrison, 2011; Volle et al., 2010;
Watson & Chatterjee, 2012). However, a recent set of
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
suggest that verbal analogical reasoning may exist on a
continuum between the two approaches depending on the
nature of the analogies. Green et al. (2010) developed a
problem set of four-term verbal analogies that varied in the
semantic distance between the source and target as
measured using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer,
Foltz, & Laham, 1998). Green and colleagues found that the
anterior regions of PFC frequently associated with relational
integration and/or abstract information processing were
engaged to a greater extent when the source and target
domains of the analogy were more distant (“far” analogies).
This result suggests that “near” analogies may employ
processing less dependent on structured representations.
To further explore this distinction we employed Green
and colleagues’ method of differentiating near and far
analogies to develop a large set of verbal analogy problems
for use with scalp electroencephalography (EEG).
Researchers interested in the use of semantic memory
during language processing have frequently used EEG
analyzed with event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate
the time-course of semantic processing. Specifically, the

Participants
Seventeen Loyola University Chicago undergraduate
students (M= 21.4 years old) participated in the experiment.
Participants gave informed consent to take part in the study
and were paid according to procedures approved by the
Loyola University Chicago Institutional Review Board. One
participant was excluded from the analysis due to poor EEG
recording quality.

participants had fewer than 15% of trials rejected due to
EEG artifacts. A 20Hz low-pass filter was applied to ERPs
for visualization only.

Four-term verbal analogy problems were constructed from
pairs of words representing one of five possible relations:
kept in (e.g. animal:zoo), kind of (e.g. aluminum:metal),
made of (e.g. candle:wax), used to (e.g. train:travel), and
works for (e.g. curator:museum). To ensure that word pairs
were representative of the claimed relation we had an earlier
group of 10 participants perform a relation naming task with
a candidate list of word pairs. In the present study we only
included word pairs in which participants could quickly
name the stated relation from the five possibilities. Word
pairs with identical relations were paired to form valid
analogies and pairs representing different relations were
paired to form invalid analogies.
Following the methods of Green and colleagues (2010)
we further divided valid and invalid analogies based on 4term semantic distance using Latent Semantic Analysis
(LSA) into either near or far analogies. LSA performs
complex algorithms on large corpora of text (semantic
spaces) to produce semantic similarity ratings for pairs of
words (Landauer, Foltz & Laham, 1998). The Matrix
Comparison feature in LSA allows users to enter a list of n
terms or word pairs and produce similarity ratings between
all terms or pairs of words (n x n) entered in the list.
Similarity ratings within the source (A:B) and target (C:D)
of each analogy problem, as well as similarity ratings
between the source and target, were acquired. The source
word pairs and overall analogies were characterized for both
near and far semantic distance using the obtained similarity
ratings from LSA.
Two counterbalanced versions of 360 unique problems
were created with 90 of each type of trial. For each version
every C:D word pair was used in all four conditions. To
minimize the chance of confounding the N400 due to
repetition effects we divided each version into quarters so
that CD word pairs could be separated in time, one in each
quarter. Both valid and invalid problems differed with
respect to semantic distance in the same way, and this was
consistent across the quarters of the experiment.
Importantly, problems did not differ with respect to mean
word length or word frequency as measured using HAL
(Burgess & Lund, 1997; Balota et al., 2007) across problem
types.

Procedure
After being prepared for the EEG recording, participants
sat in a quiet room equipped with a 21-inch CRT monitor
and an electronic response box. Participants sat 100cm from
the monitor. Stimulus width was adjusted to 4 degrees of
visual angle. The task was run and data were collected using
e-Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA).
After task instructions the participant performed 20
practice trials with feedback. Each trial began with a
randomly jittered fixation screen that lasted 500 to 1000ms
(See Figure 1a). The first word pair was presented at the
center of the screen for 3.3s. Participants were instructed to
think of how the pair of words was related. Following an
equal sign presented for 750ms, a second pair of words was
presented for 3.5s during which participants were decide
whether the two pairs of words were related in the same way
(i.e., formed a valid analogy). Participants indicated their
choice by pressing one of two buttons with two fingers from
their right hand. The entire experiment consisted of 360
trials divided into twelve blocks separated by 20s rests.

Results
Behavioral Results
Participants were more accurate in judging near than far
analogies (see Figure 2a; F(1,15) = 28.6, p < .001, ηp2 =
.66). There was no difference in accuracy with respect to
validity (F(1,15) = .2, ns, ηp2 = .01); however, there was a
significant interaction between semantic distance and
validity (F(1,15) = 8.5, p = .01, ηp2 = .36). Further contrasts
suggested that this interaction was driven by participants
being more accurate for valid near than valid far problems
(F(1,15) = 24.9, p < .001, ηp2 = .62).
Participants were also faster in judging near than far
analogies (see Figure 2b; F(1,15) = 12.1, p = .003, ηp2 =
.45), faster in judging valid compared to invalid problems
(F(1,15) = 9.7, p = .007, ηp2 = .39), and the two factors also
interacted (F(1,15) = 15.9, p = .001, ηp2 = .51). The
interaction was driven by participants being faster for valid
near than valid far problems (F(1,15) = 22.6, p < .001, ηp2 =
.60) and faster for valid than invalid near problems (F(1,15)
= 18.5, p = .001, ηp2 = .55).

EEG Recording Procedure
EEG was recorded from each participant using a 72-channel
Biosemi Active2 EEG system. 64 electrodes were located at
equidistant locations in a nylon cap. To expand the coverage
of EEG monitoring we placed two electrodes on the inferior
edge of the orbit of each eye. Raw EEG was re-referenced
to an average of the two mastoid electrodes and then highpass filtered at 0.01 Hz. The signal was then band-stop
filtered from 59 to 61 Hz to remove any AC electrical
contamination. EEG signal was corrected for ocular artifacts
using a spatial PCA filter, a method available in EMSE
(Source Signal Imaging, San Diego CA). Signal was further
cleaned via a ±100µV rejection criterion. Included

EEG Results

the methods of McCarthy and Woods (1985) we normalized
the subtraction of near and far mean amplitudes for each
time window. A 2 (near vs. far) x 2 (early vs. late) repeated
measures ANOVA demonstrated that the normalized
near/far subtraction reversed from initially being greater in
central areas to later being greater in frontal areas yielding a
reliable interaction (see Figure 4b; F(1,15) = 9.6, p = .007,
ηp2 =.39). Normalized subtractions showed an increase in
frontal channels over time (F(1,15) = 5.9, p = .02, ηp2 =.28),
while central channels showed a trend towards a decrease
(F(1,15) = 3.6, p = .08, ηp2 =.19). Thus, we believe that
Green and colleagues (2010) result that frontopolar areas
were more active for far than near analogies may be driven
by later processing likely reflective of the greater reliance
on analogical mapping while solving far analogies.

We calculated grandaverage ERPs for correct trials for each
of the four conditions (see Figure 3a). Initially we divided
the first 1400ms of processing into seven 200ms epochs and
performed a 2 (near vs. far) x 2 (valid vs. invalid) x 7
(Time) repeated measures ANOVA on mean amplitudes
from a central electrode (i.e., Cz) frequently used in N400
analyses. There were reliable main effects of semantic
distance (F(1,15) = 20., p < .001, ηp2 =.57), and time
(F(6,90) = 11.8., p < .001, ηp2 =.44), and a trend towards a
difference based on the validity of the analogy (F(1,15) =
3.5., p = .08, ηp2 =.19). Importantly there was a three way
interaction of type, validity and time (F(6,90) = 5.1., p <
.001, ηp2 =.26). As can be seen in Figure 3a far problems
have more negative ERPs beginning around the N400;
however, near invalid problems later join far valid and
invalid problems as being more negative than near valid
problems. While topographies based on valid/invalid
subtractions (see Figure 3b) are broad they tend to suggest
that differences in the near valid vs. invalid conditions move
from more central to more right frontal distributions.
Second, we focused on the N400 and calculated mean
amplitude for an early 300-500ms time window typically
used for analyzing the N400 in studies of semantic priming.
We ran a 2 (near vs. far) x 2 (valid vs. invalid) repeated
measures ANOVA. The N400 as measured in this time
window was more negative for far than near problems
regardless of problem validity (F(1,15) = 19.5., p < .001, ηp2
=.57), with no interaction (F(1,15) = 1.5, p = .24, ηp2 =.09).
To compare our results to those of Green and colleagues
(2010) and to attempt to understand the time course of
neural activity with respect to semantic distance and
topography, we conducted an additional analysis on just
correct near and far valid problems (see Figure 4). In this
analysis we focused on the early 300-500ms time window
previously mentioned and a later 900-1100ms time window
closer to the response. Nikitin and Morrison (2011) have
previously shown this later time window to be associated
with analogical mapping in a visual analogy task. Adapting

Discussion
As hypothesized, we found that the semantic distance
between source and target word pairs in verbal analogy
problems modulated the mean amplitude of the N400 ERP
with near analogies eliciting less negative N400s compared
to far analogies. The N400 ERP is sensitive to word
repetition, semantic integration, and semantic expectancy
effects (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011). Controlling word
repetition effects by utilizing identical second word pairs
across all four conditions ensured semantic integration
processes were isolated when analyzing N400 modulation.
A more negative N400 for far analogies can be explained by
the ‘knowledge integration effort’ view, which suggests
negativity in N400 amplitude is directly proportional to the
integration effort required to extract lexical representations
for each target (Holcomb, 1993). Increases in semantic
integration effort in far analogies were reflected in more
negative N400 mean amplitude as semantic distance
between source and target analogs increased.
The knowledge integration effort view also explains the
less negative N400 mean amplitude observed in near
analogies. As semantic distance between source and target
analogs decreased, less semantic integration effort was

may have facilitated semantic integration particularly in the
near analogy condition.
However, while semantic priming may be sufficient to
explain near valid analogies it may not be sufficient to reject
false analogies or perform far analogies. Beginning at the
N400, valid and invalid ERPs for near analogies diverge.
Closer inspection of the topographies (see Figure 4)
suggests engagement of areas of the brain traditionally
associated with inhibitory processing during analogy (Cho
et al. 2010; Watson & Chatterjee, 2012). In fact, Morrison
and colleagues (2004) have previously demonstrated that
frontal patients have great difficulty rejecting lures in twochoice verbal analogy problems where semantic congruity
for the false item is greater than for the true item.
Likewise, while far analogies do show a more negative
N400 than near analogies, suggesting that automatic
semantic processing is indexing semantic distance in
analogy, there is no difference in the N400 between far
valid and invalid analogies demonstrating that semantics
alone are insufficient for complete analogical processing. In
fact, like invalid near condition analogies, far analogies
engage prefrontal cortex to a greater extent, consistent with
findings by Green and colleagues (2008).
Thus, our findings suggest approaches relying solely on
tranditional semantic priming, such as recent connectionist
approaches (e.g., Leech, Mareschal & Cooper, 2008),have
limited applicability when the distance between the source
and targets of analogies increases, or when the reasoner
must choose between alternative analogues where semantics
alone do not indicate the more relationally similar match.

required to derive lexical representations. In other words,
deriving the semantic information of the first word pair and
determining the source analog relation facilitated access to
the second word pair, resulting in a less negative N400 in
near analogies. A previous study demonstrated that
analogous source pairs facilitated lexical access to target
words when participants were instructed to attend to and use
relational information (Spellman, Holyoak & Morrison,
2001). Since participants were solving analogies and
attending to the relations between words, analogical priming
