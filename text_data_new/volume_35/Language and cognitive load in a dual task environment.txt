Abstract

Background and Related Work

We investigate the effect of linguistic complexity on cognitive load in a dual-task scenario, namely simultaneous driving and language use. To this end, we designed an experiment
where participants use a driving simulator while listening to
spoken stimuli and answering comprehension questions. Online physiological measures of cognitive load, including the recently established Index of Cognitive Activity, as well as measures of performance in both tasks have been collected with
high temporal resolution. The resulting aligned data streams
can be used to test a vast array of different hypotheses about
the relationship between performance, difficulty, and cognitive
load in dual tasks at various levels of temporal resolution and
linguistic structure. We present results of the data analysis, including evidence that different linguistic structures may cause
measurable changes in cognitive workload on a very fine temporal scale in cases of increased primary task difficulty.

There is a rich literature on language use while driving a car,
largely showing that speaking on the telephone has a negative
effect on driving performance (Just et al., 2008; Kubose et al.,
2006). Further studies found that this is specific to conversations with remote speakers (independent of whether one uses
a hand-held device or free speaking), but that conversations
with an in-car passenger are less problematic (Strayer, Drews,
& Johnston, 2003; Drews, Pasupathi, & Strayer, 2004). It
appears that passengers adapt their conversation to the traffic situation, leaving the driver more resources to deal with
demands of the driving task when driving becomes difficult
(Drews, Pasupathi, & Strayer, 2008; Crundall, Bains, Chapman, & Underwood, 2005; Villing, 2009). By contrast, remote conversational partners cannot adapt their speech, so
that the driver may reach the point of cognitive overload more
easily and thus commit driving errors. However, these lines
of research have not taken into account how the fine-grained
details of linguistic complexity affect cognitive load and driving task performance.
On the other hand, there is a very rich literature on linguistic processing difficulty in single tasks using brain imaging,
ERPs, and reading time studies, as well as a number of dual
task experiments generally showing that performance on the
linguistic task deteriorates with increased complexity of the
other task, see for example King and Just (1991). Finally,
multiple models explain the effect of cognitive load in one
task on performance in another (Baddeley, 2003; Wickens,
2008; Just, Carpenter, & Miyake, 2003).
We see, however, unbroken ground in relating the effect of
linguistic complexity on a realistic task (e.g., driving) and the
size of the interference of linguistic processing with driving
performance. This study takes a step in this direction in testing different methods for assessing cognitive load and the effect of one particular linguistic structure—incrementally ambiguous relative clauses—on driving performance in a simplified but controllable and continuous driving task.

Introduction
Is there a relationship between psycholinguistic measures of
language complexity and quantified cognitive workload in
dual-task environments? To answer this question, we experimentally evaluate these measures of language processing in
an environment where one task is language-related and the
other not. Such language complexity measures have been
shown in single-task studies to account for processing difficulty. This work represents a first step in which we investigate the effect of a grammatical structure (German locally
ambiguous subject vs. object relative clauses) on a simplified,
well-controlled non-linguistic task, a driving task.
Dual tasks are ubiquitous in everyday life, often in situations where attention and performance in the primary task is
critical. An example is driving while engaging in dialogue,
be it with a passenger, a dialogue-controlled interface, or remotely via mobile phone. Engaging in dialogue generally affects driving performance and safety (Just, Keller, & Cynkar,
2008; Young, Regan, & Hammer, 2007).
We manipulated the driving task difficulty and the structural complexity of the linguistic items. We also collected
measurements of performance in both tasks and fine-grained
physiological indicators of cognitive load, namely skin conductance levels and pupil sizes. We computed values from
pupil size for the recent Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA).
To our knowledge, this is the first study using the ICA measure in a setting with a language task.

The dual-task experiment
The ConTRe task
Our primary task was a tracking task (Jagacinski & Flach,
2003) presented as a car driving scenario and called the “Continuous Tracking and Reaction” (ConTRe) task (Mahr, Feld,

2148

some parents called] because of such a trivial issue, has
now called a parents’ meeting.”

Figure 1: A screenshot of the ConTRe steering task.

The sentence is locally ambiguous between ORC and SRC
until reaching the auxiliary; in previous experiments, increased reaction times in a speeded judgment task (Bader &
Meng, 1999) have been observed when subjects read “haben”
(ORC) compared to “hat” (SRC). This is evidence for an interpretive bias toward SRC. All items were synthesized prior
to the experiment using MARY TTS (Schröder, Charfuelan,
Pammi, & Türk, 2008) and pauses manipulated so that the
critical region duration (hat / haben) is always identical.

Experimental setup
Moniri, & Math, 2012). In this task, participants see a simulated 3-D road moving at a constant speed, intended to simulate a moving vehicle. Additionally, two bars of different
color appear approximately 20m in front of the simulated vehicle. The two bars represent the vehicle’s position and the
target (reference) position. They move laterally across the
screen. The reference bar’s movement is pseudo-randomly
generated by an algorithm, while the “vehicle” bar is controllable by the participant by means of a gaming steering wheel.
Participants were instructed to track the reference bar’s movements with the controllable bar as closely as possible. To reduce noise in our data, we removed all other elements of the
original ConTRe environment (e.g., buildings along the side
of the road, and traffic lights), except for the road and the
moving bars. A screenshot of the simulated environment can
be seen in fig. 1.
This task is a useful abstraction of driving, since it allows a
precise and continuous performance measure for steering, essential to driving. We manipulated the difficulty of the ConTRe task by changing the speed of the reference and vehicle
bars in order to create a “difficult driving” condition and an
“easy driving” condition1 .

Language comprehension task
The spoken comprehension task consists in listening to a sentence containing a relative clause followed by two thematically related ‘filler’ sentences and a yes/no comprehension
question. Questions were related to the relative clause (50%
of the stimuli) or to the filler sentences. All sentences and
questions are in German, inspired by Bader and Meng (1999).
The stimuli are designed in pairs in such a way that the items
in each pair are identical except for the form of the auxiliary
of the relative clause (RC), which determines whether it is an
object RC (ORC) or a subject RC (SRC). An example of such
a relative clause pair is the following:
Die Lehrerin, die einige Eltern wegen einer solchen
Kleinigkeit angerufen [haben / hat], hat nun eine Elternversammlung einberufen.
“The teacherFEM [who called some parents / whom
1 Easy: reference bar maximum speed = 1m/s, controllable bar =
2m/s. Difficult: reference bar = 2.5 m/s, controllable bar = 4m/s.

Each experiment is divided into 4 recording phases, each lasting about 6 minutes, with short pauses in-between. Each
phase is composed of a driving-only phase of 2 minutes followed by a driving-with-language phase of approximately 4
minutes, during which 10 blocks, consisting each of one relative clause, two fillers and one question. Participants answer
the question verbally and their response is coded by the experimenter. In the first and the third phase, the driving difficulty
is set to “easy”, while in the second and fourth phase it is set
to “difficult”. The order of presented items in the language
condition was randomized, and we ensured that each person
only saw one condition of each item.

Measures of cognitive workload
We have two principal sources of quantified cognitive workload data: physiological and task dependent. Our physiological measures are further divided into two subtypes: pupil
area-based (pupillometry) and skin conductance-based, both
of which have been widely used in cognitive workload studies, although principally on non-linguistic tasks. Our study is
an opportunity to evaluate the relative efficacy of these data
sources on linguistic tasks. We also take the opportunity to
evaluate a novel form of pupillometric data processing: the
Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to investigate the potential of the
ICA as a measure of linguistically-induced cognitive load in
a dual-task scenario.
Our task-dependent measure is driving performance in our
simulated environment, which serves to confirm the “realworld” effect of variations in cognitive workload.
The Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) Research in pupillometry (Just et al., 2003; Engelhardt, Ferreira, & Patsenko,
2010; Palinko, Kun, Shyrokov, & Heeman, 2010) has found
that cognition-related changes in pupil size typically amount
to a difference of 20% relative to the typical pupil size (Laeng,
Sirois, & Gredebäck, 2010). However, light conditions also
affect pupil sizes, with brightness-induced changes being
much larger than cognitively induced ones (up to 120% of
typical pupil size).
The Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA; Marshall (2002)) is a
patented measure which applies signal processing techniques
to filter out slow, large light-induced changes and identify

2149

the occurrence of short, abrupt changes in pupil size, held
to be caused by cognitive load. The ICA measure is argued to
be robust with respect to changes in light conditions and eye
movement. It relates the frequency of rapid small changes in
pupil size (also known as pupillary hippus) to cognitive load.
The ICA measure has been used for measuring cognitive
load in driving simulation tasks (Schwalm, Keinath, & Zimmer, 2008), simulated driving and visual search (Marshall,
2007), detecting different levels of surgical skill (Richstone
et al., 2010), and for measuring linguistically induced cognitive load (Demberg, Kiagia, & Sayeed, 2013) among other
uses. Demberg (2013) provides a more detailed analysis of
the ICA measure in the dual task setting presented here.
ICA measurements have been shown to be relatively stable
across several commonly used eye tracker models and sample
rates ranging from 60 to 300 Hz (Bartels & Marshall, 2012).
We used a head-mounted Eyelink II and sampled at 250Hz.
Skin conductance response Our second physiological
proxy for measuring cognitive load is skin conductance response (SCR), which we calculate from skin conductance
level (SCL). Changes in the electrical conductance of the skin
are due to activity of the sweat glands, which are in turn controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. Skin conductance
amplitude usually changes with respect to its “neutral” (tonic)
level in response to unexpected, significant, or aversive stimuli. SCL has been previously used as a measure of cognitive
load (Shi, Ruiz, Taib, Choi, & Chen, 2007). In a dual task
experiment with simulated driving and a secondary cognitive
task, B. Mehler, Reimer, Coughlin, and Dusek (2009) found
that skin conductance levels peaked in cases of mental overload caused by incrementally increasing secondary task difficulty, which was followed by a deterioration in the performance of the primary task. Son and Park (2011) found skin
conductance levels along with steering wheel reversals (used
as a measure of task performance) to be good input features
for an artificial neural network built to predict task difficulty.
We used the Ledalab software (Benedek & Kaernbach,
2010) to separate our raw skin conductance measurements
into an estimate of the tonic component and the phasic component. The software also allows to calculate the number
of skin conductance response events. SCR events are the
“peaks” of the phasic component of skin conductance; both
the number of such events per time unit and the amplitude of
the peaks are used in the analysis below.

ming up to about 12 hours. We performed our data analysis
in R using linear mixed effects (LME) modeling with lme4
(Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008) and mgcv (Wood, 2001).

Correlation between physiological measures
The first question we explored was whether our physiological
measures are correlated with one another. While there is no
significant correlation between the raw skin conductance levels and the ICA, we do find a significant positive correlation
between the number of skin conductance events and the ICA
(using Spearman’s ρ; left ICA: ρ = 0.06; p < 0.0001; right
ICA: ρ = 0.09; p < 0.0001). One important aspect to keep in
mind is also possibly different latencies of the two measures
in reaction to a stimulus.
We find a strong correlation between the ICA of the left and
right eye (cor = 0.74; p > 0.001, Pearson’s product-moment
correlation coefficient).

Response to experimental phases
Driving performance The next hypothesis we tested was
whether our task performance measure in the driving task,
i.e., the steering deviation, is sensitive not only to the driving
task difficulty, but also to the presence of language. In figure
2, we have plotted the mean deviation for each of the difficulty settings (easy and difficult driving), with and without
the secondary linguistic task. Using linear mixed effects models with a random intercept and random slopes by subject,
we found a large significant main effect of driving difficulty
(coe f = 0.3;t = 20.33; p < 0.001), showing that steering was
less accurate when driving was more difficult. We also found
a significant positive main effect of whether we are in a language phase (coe f = −0.05;t = −5.00; p < 0.001; steering is
worse when people are listening to language, see also figure
3), as well as a significant interaction between driving difficulty and the language phase, indicating that the effect of
language was more burdensome in the difficult driving condition (coe f = −0.024;t = −6.98; p < 0.001). To confirm
whether the effect of language is significant in both driving
conditions, we also split the data into two subsets, easy driving and difficult driving, and found that the effect of language
was significant in both linear mixed effects models.
This figure illustrates an obvious difference between steering deviation in the easy and difficult driving conditions.

Driving performance We use performance on the ConTRe
task as an additional measure of cognitive load. The task lets
us define several measures of task success, including the distance between the reference bar and the controllable bar at
each point in time and the speed and acceleration of the controllable bar.

Results
We ran our experiment with 24 German native speakers aged
20-34, with the total duration of the recorded samples sum-

Pupillometry For the ICA, we find a main effect of driving difficulty in the ICA of the right eye, but not in the left
eye (Table 1). Furthermore, we find significantly more blinks
during the phases when language was playing. In-depth analysis of the pupillometric data reveals that overall dilation
was larger when people were listening to language stimuli,
but the number of ICA events was lower (Figure 3). If we
look into the language phase, however, the ICA of both eyes
went down significantly whenever language wasn’t playing
(e.g., between stimuli; Table 1: we factored out the effect of
blinks or partial blinks on both the pupil area calculations and
the ICA). This effect can also be seen in Figure 3, where the
10 ICA spikes in the language region coincide with our 10
blocks of language stimuli.
Skin conductance For skin conductance, we cannot easily
compare the easy vs. difficult driving settings, as the skin conductance measuring device was removed between phases, and
comparison of absolute values between phases is thus impossible. A measure that can be compared between driving conditions is however the number of skin conductance events.
When running a linear mixed effects regression model with
this measure as a response variable, we find that more such
skin conductance events happened, as expected, in the difficult driving condition, see Table 2.
We do however not find any significant effect of the language vs. no language condition on this measure. Unexpectedly, we find that tonic skin conductance is lower in the driving plus language condition, see Figure 3.

Cognitive load and language processing difficulty
To this point, we find that the measures largely behave as expected. Thus we come to our main question: can they detect
the effect of fine-grained language complexity? To this end,
we analysed the data to see whether we can find a) a correlate for higher processing difficulty in the ambiguous region
or right after the disambiguation at hat/haben, and b) whether
ORCs lead to less cognitive load than SRCs.
Disambiguating region Detailed analysis of the ambiguous region of the relative clause shows that the Index of Cognitive Activity is high during the ambiguous region of the

relative clause (during the time span of -2000msec to 0msec),
and that the ICA sharply falls right after disambiguation (see
Table 4 which shows a significant reduction in ICA of both
eyes following disambiguation, encoded as time wrt. onset).
These effects hold over and above effects of the steering task,
which have been mathematically accounted for by including
the task difficulty as a factor in the model. These results indicate that subjects encounter processing difficulty due to the
ambiguity. (This is possibly also something they learn during
the experiment.)
For skin conductance, we know that effects can be expected 2-4 seconds after the stimulus. Figure 4 shows a significant rise in skin conductance during the five seconds after

A last link that we wanted to investigate was the one between
performance in the linguistic task (i.e., answer accuracy) and
the difficulty of the driving and language tasks. We built a binomial LME model with the answer accuracy as the response
factor and driving task difficulty, relative clause type, and the
voice (passive vs. active) of the question as fixed effects with
a random intercept per participant and subject and a random
slope for relative clause type by item2 . The resulting coefficients are presented in Table 5. While answer accuracy was
lower for object relative clauses (74%) than for subject relative clauses (78%), and lower in difficult driving (75%) than
in easy driving (77%), these differences did not reach significance. (NB: questions related to relative clauses were only
asked after half of the items; i.e., this analysis is based on relatively little data.) The only significant negative effect on answer accuracy was found for passive voice questions, which
means that there are significantly more wrong answers to passive voice questions than to active voice ones (this is not unexpected, as it has long been known that passives are more
difficult to process than actives (J. Mehler, 1963)).

the critical region, which would be consistent with an interpretation that the ambiguity causes higher cognitive load.
But can we see any effect of our linguistic stimuli on the
driving performance? We compared steering accuracy at the
time of the disambiguating region with steering accuracy during the two seconds before and after, and indeed found that
deviation of the controllable bar from the reference bar was
significantly larger during the disambiguating region than before or after; see the positive coefficient (Table 3) for the binary variable “critical region”.

Discussion and conclusions

Subject vs. object relative clauses Finally, we test whether
the ICA is sensitive to fine-grained linguistic complexity effects. We isolated the subset of the data which fell within
the 1800msec following the onset of the critical region hat
/ haben. The duration of this critical region at hat / haben
is 650 ms in both conditions, which we imposed by manipulating the duration of the phrase boundary pause during synthesis. On this subset of the data, we built two LME models
(one for each eye) with the ICA measure as the response variable and the relative clause type as the fixed effect, while also
introducing a random effect per participant.

We did not find any significant effects of relative clause
condition on skin conductance, overall pupil dilation or steering performance.

Performance in the language task

Table 4: Mixed effects regression analysis with left and right
ICA as response variable, 100–1800msec after critical region
onset. (Critical region duration: 0-600msec)

The results of this analysis are shown in Table 4. We can
see that there is a negative effect for the SRC type in both
cases, although only the result for the right eye is significant.
The interpretation of the coefficient is that SRCs tend to occur
with smaller values of ICA than ORCs.

We designed the tasks in our experiment to require continuous
attention. The language task clearly affects performance on
the primary steering task: we see the effect of the secondary
task in all of our measures. Furthermore, we find effects of
linguistic ambiguity and complexity in our measures of cognitive load: during the ambiguous region in our stimuli, we
see evidence for higher cognitive load in our pupillometric
measure, which is also reflected in a slightly later galvanic
skin response. During the disambiguating region, we observe
significantly higher steering deviation, which indicates that
people are allocating more mental resources to the linguistic
task, hence impeding steering performance. We also found
evidence for a measurable effect of linguistic complexity in
our pupillometric measure ICA: the ICA was significantly
higher during the disambiguating region and the following
second for the ORC condition compared to SRC. This experiment provides early support for the ICA as a useful measure
to assess language-induced cognitive load.
