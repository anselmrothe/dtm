studies are premised on using English speaking participants.
Therefore, insight tasks based on a wide variety of languages
are required to promote the development of research in this
field.
Thus, our research purpose is to develop a Japanese version
of the RAT for use in brain research using examples from
the standard RAT task widely used in current neuroscience
studies. In addition to developing the task, we tried to reveal
the relationship between brain activities and the process of
insight problem solving, including both processes of an impasse and evoking an emotional experience when solutions
are found.

Abstract
This study aims to develop a Japanese version of the remote
associates test required to decompose semantic chunks for use
not only in behavioral studies but also in brain researches. Further, this study attempted to reveal the relationship between the
process of solving insight problems and brain activities. Results of the behavioral data show that the solution time was significantly longer in the chunked than in the non-chunked condition. The imaging data identified the following brain activities. First, the right and left cingulate gyri, related to conflict
monitoring, were more activated during the process of searching for a target in the chunked than in the non-chunked condition. Second, the left posterior cingulate gyrus was more activated when the participants could find a target by overcoming
constraints as semantic chunks related to emotional process.

Japanese RAT Required to Decompose Semantic
Chunks

Introduction
Reproductive thinking is the application of previously acquired knowledge and efficiently solves typical problems.
However, in insight problems, such reproductive thinking
forms mental sets, preventing solution and leading problem
solvers to an impasse (Dominowski & Dallob, 1995; Ohlsson, 1992; Smith, 1995). Thus, problem solving is accomplished by overcoming such reproductive thinking. Problem
solvers often have an “aha!” experience when solving insight
problems (Davidson, 1995; Metcalfe, 1986a,b; Metcalfe &
Wiebe, 1987). Such characteristics of insight process, including an impasse and sudden attainment with the emotional
experience, have been studied through psychological experiments. Moreover, in recent years, many studies revealed
the mechanisms between characteristic insight processes and
brain functions (Dietrich & Kanso, 2010).
Insight problems generally used for related researches
(e.g., nine dots problem, candle problem, triangle of coins)
require at least several minutes to solve them. Further, once
they are solved, they cannot be reused as problem solving
tasks among the same participants. In contrast, when employing brain imaging studies, verbal problems including anagram tasks, riddles, and the remote associates test (RAT) have
been used. This is owing to the fact that these studies require
not only the use of problems that can be solved within several
tens of seconds but also can be used repeatedly for the same
participants. However, almost all tasks used in brain imaging

Insight problem solving characterized by an impasse and the
suddenness of solution with emotional experience represents
a radical representation change. Problem solvers have to reconstruct their erroneous mental representations constructed
at an early stage of insight problem solving, whereas they can
take step-by-step analytic approaches in non-insight problems. Such representation change in the insight process has
been interpreted based on the theories such as the transition of problem spaces and the chunk decomposition by conducting psychological experiments (Kaplan & Simon, 1990;
Knoblich et al., 1999; Ohlsson, 1992). Familiarity with a
class of objects and events leads to the creation of patterns
as chunks that capture recurring constellations of features or
components. Preserving the mental efforts by using chunked
knowledge contributes to efficient problem solving. However, if the available chunk does not work in a way that is
helpful vis-à-vis finding a solution, it might work to prevent
solving the problem. Moreover, once it is constructed, it is
difficult to decimate and an impasse might result (Knoblich
et al., 1999; Ohlsson, 1992).
RAT consists of sets of three words drawn from a mutually
remote associate cluster. Problem solvers are required to find
a fourth word which could serve as a specific kind of associative connective link between these disparate words (Mednick, 1962). One example might be a set of three problem
words: “arm,” “coal,” “peach.” The answer to the example
is the word “pit.” The answer word generate three words or

3516

phrases, “armpit,” “coalpit,” and “peach pit,” being connected
with each problem word. However, constraints have not been
controlled in the RAT used in cognitive neuroscience research
(e.g., Bowden & Jung-Beeman, 2003). Thus, in previous
studies using RAT-like problems, the definition of obtaining
insight was based on finding a solution, solution time, and/or
self-reported sudden, unforeseen flash of illumination. Alternatively, this study developed a Japanese RAT with controllable constraints based on chunk decomposition. The existence of chunks, which prevents finding association between
problem words, would lead problem solvers to search for a
target within incorrect problem spaces and arrive at an impasse. They might also get an “aha!” experience when an
impasse based on chunks is resolved, and subsequently the
problems are solved.

Hypotheses
As demonstrated in previous neuroscience studies, conflicts
attributed to constraints preventing problem solving were associated with activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
(Aziz-Zadeh et al., 2009; Kounios & Jung-Beeman, 2009;
Luo et al., 2004; Qiu et al., 2008). Moreover, in the process of insight problem solving, a solution seems to arise
suddenly, accompanied by an emotional experience generally
known as an “aha!” experience (Csikszentmihalyi & Sawyer,
1995; Davidson, 1995; Metcalfe, 1986a,b; Metcalfe & Wiebe,
1987). It is known that such emotional experiences in insight
problem solving are associated with activity in the posterior
cingulated cortex (PCC) (Qiu et al., 2008).
In this study, which involves the use of an fMRI while conducting psychological experiments, we propose the following
two hypotheses regarding brain activities both when struggling with an insight problem and then solving it.
Hypothesis 1 When problem solvers fail to find a solution,
the existence of chunks are associated with activity in the
ACC because in preventing solutions conflicts arise.
Hypothesis 2 When problem solvers find a solution, the solutions are associated with activity in the PCC related to
emotional experience, in addition to activation in the ACC.

Task
Figure 1 illustrates the structure of a Japanese RAT that requires decomposition of semantic chunk. Stimuli of the task
are presented on a computer screen containing six kanji characters. The purpose of the task was to find a common kanji
character (target) with which each of the three kanji characters presented on the upper row (problem characters) could
form a meaningful word. However, distracters presented below the problem characters prevent the finding of the target
because the distracters could form meaningful words with
each of the problem characters. Therefore, participants are required to decompose the semantic chunks between the problem characters and distracters to find the target through remote association. Moreover, the task can control the existence of the semantic chunks between problem characters and

Methods
Participants Eighteen healthy, right-handed undergraduate
students (aged 19 to 36 years) participated in this experiment. The participants were native Japanese speakers and
their handedness was assessed by a modified Oldfield questionnaire (Oldfield, 2004). The participants provided written
informed consent in accordance with the research ethics committee guidelines of Nagoya University’s Research Institute
of Environmental Medicine.
Design Participants were given a practice session using two
examples outside of the MRI scanner. Following the practice
session, they engaged in 60 problems while in the scanner.
The problems consisted of 30 chunked and 30 non-chunked
problems. The chunked and non-chunked problems were
counter-balanced between participants (the chunked problems presented to the half of the participants were treated as
non-chunked problem for the other half, and vice versa). The
sequences of problems were also randomized throughout the
experimental session.
Figure 2 illustrates the experimental sequence. Each problem was presented for 30 seconds to the participants. The
resting interval between trials was 12 seconds. They were
required to press the left button assigned to the index finger
of their right hand when finding a target immediately. After
pressing the left button, the target, the answer to the problem
was presented. Participants were required to press the left
button when their answer corresponded to the target, whereas
they were required to press the right button assigned to their
middle finger when their answers were incorrect. Taking a
10 minute break outside of the scanner, this sequence was repeated 60 times. The experiment consisted of two fMRI runs.
Imaging Data Acquisition All scanning whole-brain images were acquired by using a gradient echo planar image
acquisition on a 3T MRI Scanner (Siemens Verio, Siemens
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The functional imaging pa-

rameters were TR = 2.5s, TE = 30ms, FA = 70◦ , VoF = 20cm
× 20cm, and 39 slices. To avoid head movement, the participants wore a neck brace and were asked not to talk or
move during MRI scanning. High-resolution anatomical images (T1) were also acquired by using gradient echo planar
image acquisition. We acquired T1 images (TR = 2.5s, TE =
2.48ms, FA = 8◦ ) with 192 sagittal slices, each being 1mm in
thickness. Motion correction was also performed in a standard realign process in SPM8.
Imaging Data Analysis The image data were analyzed using SPM8. Each participants’s imaging data was individually preprocessed (realignment, slice time adjustment, coregistration, normalization, smoothing) and the spatially preprocessed data was then estimated to establish a random effects
model. Statistical threshold was set at p < .001, uncorrelated
with an extended threshold of 10 contiguous voxels.

Behavioral Results Results of the solution rates within
both 15 and 30 seconds, as shown in Figure 3 (the error

nificant difference was observed (t(17) = 1.90，n.s.).
Next, we compared the average solution time when the
participants could find a target between two conditions (Figure 4). The t-tests within both 15 and 30 seconds showed
significant differences between the two conditions (15 sec:
t(17) = −3.67， p < .01; 30 sec: t(17) = −3.39， p < .01).
These results demonstrate that the search for the targets
was prevented more in the chunked than in the non-chunked
condition owing to the existence of the semantic chunks.
Imaging Results Next, we compared the brain activations
in both the chunked and non-chunked conditions. In the following analyses, we focused on two different trials: participants failed to find a target (failed trials) and participants
could find a target (correct trials). In the correct trials, imaging data were analyzed for the entire 30 seconds while the

stimuli were presented. In the failed trials, imaging data were
analyzed until finding a target.
Chunked > Non-chunked (failed trials)
In the failed trials, this contrast examined the brain areas
that were more activated during searching for a target in the
chunked condition when compared with those in the nonchunked condition. Several peaks of activation were found,
including the right and left cingulate gyri (right BA 24, left
BA 24, left BA 32), the left medial frontal gyrus (left BA 32,
left BA 11, left BA 6), and the left paracentral lobule (left BA
31) (Table 1). Figure 5 depicts these areas of activation.
Chunked > Non-chunked (correct trials)
In the correct trials, this contrast examined the brain areas
that were more activated until a target was found in the chunked condition when compared with those in the non-chunked
condition. It was confirmed that the left posterior cingulate
(left BA 30) was activated (Table 2). Figure 6 depicts this
area of activation.
Non-chunked > Chunked (failed trials)
This contrast revealed no voxels that were significantly
more active in the non-chunked than in the chunked condition when the participants could not find targets.
Non-chunked > Chunked (correct trials)
Same as when the participants could not find a target, this
contrast revealed no voxels that were significantly more activated in the non-chunked than in the chunked condition when
participants found a target.

Discussion
Results of the behavioral data show that the solution time was
significantly longer in the chunked than in the non-chunked
condition. Knoblich et al. (1999) constructed an insight task
with chunks having different tightness, and displayed that the

3519

problem solving performance while solving problems with a
tight chunk declined from those with a loose chunk. Our behavioral results suggest that the semantic chunks, introduced
by the Japanese RAT, prevent finding solutions, which is consistent with the related work.
In the following, we will discuss in detail more activated
brain areas in the chunked than in the non-chunked condition,
both when the participants could find a target and when they
could not.
Failed Trials The right and left cingulate gyri (right BA
24, left BA 24, left BA 32) were more activated during the
process of searching for a target in the chunked than in the
non-chunked condition. The cingulate gyrus has been widely
believed to be related to insight problem solving (Aziz-Zadeh
et al., 2009; Kounios & Jung-Beeman, 2009; Luo et al., 2004;
Qiu et al., 2008). For example, Aziz-Zadeh et al. (2009) reported that the ACC is more activated in insight solutions
when compared with the search solution while solving anagram tasks. Luo et al. (2004) also showed that relative to the
non-“aha” event, the “aha” event was associated with activities in ACC. Botvinick et al. (1999) revealed that the ACC
might also be linked with conflict monitoring.
Previous results indicated that the ACC is related to preliminary process to evade impasse in which problem solvers
get fixated with incorrect problem spaces as conflict monitoring (Dietrich & Kanso, 2010). The activation on the cingulate
gyrus in our research appears to monitor the process among
the competing, an option aroused by semantic chunks and alternatives. This result supposes hypothesis 1.
Correct trials In addition, when the participants could find
a target, the left posterior cingulate gyrus (left BA 30) was
more activated until they found a target in the chunked than
in the non-chunked condition. Some researches indicated that
the retrosplenial cortex, in particular BA 30 and the neighboring posterior cingulate cortex including BA 23 and BA 31
might be associated with the cognitive processing of emotions
(Cato et al., 2004; Maddock, 1999; Maddock & Buonocore,
1997). For example, Cato et al. (2004) showed that activation
uniquely associated with word generation to categories with
positive or negative versus neutral emotional connotation occurred in the retrosplenial cortex.
One of the essential characteristics of insight problem solving is an impressive and surprising emotional experience
upon sudden and discontinuous solution. For example, Csikszentmihalyi & Sawyer (1995) conducted detailed interviews
with creative individuals who have made a creative contribution to the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, or business/politics, and were generally older than 60
years. The interviewees reported their exciting experiences
when receiving insight. Such emotional experience in insight
problem solving is known as the “aha!” experience (Davidson, 1995; Metcalfe, 1986a,b; Metcalfe & Wiebe, 1987). (Qiu
et al., 2008) also discussed in their ERP study that the “aha!”
feeling might increasingly activate the PCC when Chinese lo-

gogriphs were completed than when they were not solved. In
our experiment, the activation of the left posterior cingulate
(left BA 30) when the participants found a target suggests that
when finding a target, overcoming constraints correlates more
with emotional process than without such a constraint.
However, the activation of the cingulate cortex when the
participants could not find a target was not confirmed when
they could. This result was likely to be caused by the semantic chunks as constraints preventing to solve problems might
be decomposed in the early stage of the insight problem solving process when they found a target. Therefore, the activation of the cingulate cortex was not confirmed. These results
are partially supported by our hypothesis 2.

Conclusion
This study aims to develop a Japanese version of the RAT
required to decompose semantic chunks for use not only in
behavioral studies but also in brain researches. Moreover, we
tried to reveal the relationship between the brain activity and
both process of an impasse and evoking an emotional experience when solutions are found.
Results of the behavioral analysis showed that the Japanese
RAT constructed in our research worked well as expected.
The imaging data identified the following brain activities.
First, the right and left cingulate gyri related to conflict
monitoring were increasingly activated during the process of
searching for a target in the chunked than in the non-chunked
condition. Second, the left posterior cingulate gyrus was
more activated when the participants could find a target by
overcoming constraints as semantic chunks related to emotional process. These are important initial steps to be taken in
the study of the relationship between insight problem solving
process and brain activities using the Japanese version of the
RAT.
