Abstract

In the attraction effect (Fig. 1A), given two similarly
preferred options, A and B, the introduction of a third
option Z that is similar to B, but also clearly inferior to
B in one or both attribute dimensions, results in an increase in relative preference for B over A (Huber, Payne,
& Puto, 1982; Heath & Chatterjee, 1995). In the compromise effect (Fig. 1B), when B > A in one attribute
and B < A in another attribute, and Z has the same
tradeoff but is even more extreme than B, then B becomes the “compromise” option and becomes preferred
relative to A (Simonson, 1989). In the similarity effect
(Fig. 1C), the introduction of a third option Z, that is
very similar and comparable to B in both attribute dimensions, shifts the relative preference away from B to
A (Tversky, 1972).

Introduction
Everyday decision-making often involves choosing
among options that differ in multiple attribute dimensions. For example, should you buy a house that is more
spacious or one that is better located? Understanding
how humans make these multi-attribute decisions, and
how their choices depend on the context, is an important
problem in cognitive science.
Multi-attribute decision-making is particularly challenging because there is often no universal or intrinsic
way to assign relative values to the different attributes.
This is especially true in contexts where the decisionmaker has limited experience (and thus significant uncertainty about market conditions), such as with big-ticket
items like houses, or new technology like smart phones.
Human choice behavior in multi-attribute problems exhibits certain systematic shifts due to context changes,
such as when the relative preference between two options shift or even reverse when a third option, known
as a decoy, is added, leading to suggestions of underlying irrationality or suboptimality (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Tversky
& Simonson, 1993).

Humans exhibit certain systematic context-dependent
preference reversals when choosing among options that
vary along multiple attribute dimensions. For instance,
the attraction, similarity, and compromise effects each
involves a change in relative preference between two options when a third option is introduced. Previously,
such effects have been attributed to irrationality or suboptimality in decision-making, or to specific architectural or dynamical constraints on cognition. We use
a Bayesian model of multi-attribute choice to demonstrate that these effects naturally arise from three basic assumptions: (1) humans assess options relative to
“fair market value” as inferred from prior experience and
available options; (2) attributes are imperfectly substitutable, and scarce attributes are relatively more valuable; (3) uncertainty about market conditions and option values contributes to stochasticity in choice behavior. This work provides both a novel normative explanation for contextual modulation of choice behavior, and a
means to predict choice as a function of past experiences
and novel contexts.

effect, (C) similarity effect. A and B are two equally
preferable choices that differ in two attribute dimensions.
The introduction of a third option Z induces a preference shift between A and B (indicated by arrows). Solid
and dashed lines illustrate model-inferred “fair value”
indifference curve before and after introducing Z.
Two broad classes of models have previously been
proposed for contextual effects in multi-attribute choice
behavior: (1) normative models (Marr, 1982) that are
built on behavioral constraints/goals and delineated in
terms of internal beliefs and assumptions (Luce, 1959;
Thurstone, 1954; Luce, 1965; Tversky, 1972; Tversky &
Simonson, 1993); (2) algorithmic or implementational
models that explain behavioral phenomena as arising
from specific architectural and dynamical constraints on
neural processing (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993; Usher
& McClelland, 2004; J. S. Trueblood, 2012).
The first class of models are related to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955), but have so far been unable to
explain all three contextual effects, leading to sugges-

1300

tions that such preference shifts reflect biases or suboptimalities in human decision-making. For example,
the discovery of the similarity effect invalidated Luce’s
early ratio-of-strength model (Luce, 1959), and other related models that follow the simple scalability principle
(Tversky, 1972). Tversky proposed the elimination-byaspects model (Tversky, 1972) to explain the similarity
effect, but it was invalidated by the discovery of the attraction effect, which violates the regularity principle,
thus ruling out a large class of random utility models
(Luce, 1965), including Thurstone’s preferential choice
theory (Thurstone, 1954). The compromise effect presented further complication, as no previous model could
account for it, and a new context-dependent preference
model (Tversky & Simonson, 1993) was only able to account for it, along with the attraction effect, by letting
slip the similarity effect (Roe, Busemeyer, & Townsend,
2001).
The second class of models can account for all three
effects, but are based on rather detailed and specific assumptions about neural dynamic and architecture, which
have thus far not been verified experimentally, and whose
computational provenance and consequences are unclear.
Here, we propose a novel rational account of multiattribute decision-making that explains all three contextual effects. The model is grounded in three basic, empirically motivated assumptions: (1) humans make preferential choices based on relative values anchored with
respect to what is perceived “fair” in the marketplace
(Ariely, 2008), which is inferred from observed data, including the set of available options (Wernerfelt, 1995;
Sher & McKenzie, 2011); (2) different attributes are
imperfect substitutes for one another (Hicks, 1932), in
particular one unit of a scarce attribute is more valuable than an abundant one; (3) uncertainty in posterior belief about “market conditions” contributes to
stochasticity in preference on repeated presentations of
the same options (see e.g., Debreu, 1958). We formalize
these assumptions using a Bayesian generative model,
and demonstrate that all three contextual effects are
consequences of rational (Bayesian) inference of relative
value, conditioned on the available options. In contrast
to previous models, we view each decision as not only
an expression of choice, but also as an opportunity for
learning about the marketplace based on the set of options given. Thus, an individual’s preference can differ
in different contexts, not because of arbitrary contextdependent factors (Hsee, Zhang, Yu, & Xi, 2004; Srivastava & Schrater, 2012), but because of normative evolution of an individual’s internal beliefs about the option
landscape. Moreover, our model provides a means to predict individual and group preferences in novel contexts
given past choices. In the following, we first describe the
Bayesian model, followed by a comparison of simulated
model behavior and empirically observed contextual ef-

fects found in the literature, and finally conclude with a
discussion.

Bayesian model of relative value
inference
We begin with an intuitive explanation for contextual
effects before delving into the technical details of the
model. While we explain the phenomena primarily in
terms of consumer decision-making here, in the Discussion we will extend the model and explanation beyond
choices among consumer products.
We model presented options as being drawn from a
shared landscape of options, which implies that the options are representative of the market in some sense, and
are useful for inferring general market conditions. In
fact, humans often use available context to infer a reference point for valuation–for instance, in the framing
effect, humans evaluate the quality of an outcome differently based on whether it is described in terms of success rates or failure rates (Sher & McKenzie, 2006). In
the case of multi-attribute valuation, “fair market value”
could potentially be inferred by fitting an equi-preference
contour, or indifference curve (Pareto, 1927), through
the presented options, where points above the line would
be a “good deal”, while ones below would be a “bad
deal.” Given the formal relationship between regression
and inference (Bishop, 2006), this process is equivalent
to inferring mean market value and relative attribute importance based on the samples. We first use this general
intuition to explain the three effects, and subsequently
present a precise generative model and inference procedure for multi-attribute choice.
In the attraction effect, A and B both initially lie on
the inferred “fair value” indifference curve. Introducing Z, which is close to B but clearly inferior in one or
both attribute dimensions, drives down the inferred “fair
value” indifference line (dashed line) near B, making B
appear to be a good deal (while A is still fair, and Z is
worse than fair). The compromise effect arises from imperfect substitutability and diminishing marginal utility
(Hicks, 1932) – e.g. the value of a small house in a good
location would increase much more with a small increase
in size than it would with a slight improvement in location. Thus, the indifference curves, including the fair
value curve, should be strictly convex rather than linear. The compromise effect then naturally arises when
Z is introduced, because the convex line corresponding
to “fair” passes between B and Z, making B appear to
be better than fair (and A fair or worse than fair). To
account for the similarity effect, we adopt a stochastic
decision policy that reflects posterior uncertainty about
both market conditions and option values: the model
samples from the joint posterior distribution over option values and chooses the maximally valued option.
Because of the proximity of B and Z in the attribute

Figure 2: Bayesian generative model of relative value
inference. Each two-attribute option oi = (xi , yi ) has an
underlying scalar value vi , parameterized by γ, θi . The
value vi itself is generated from a prior distribution with
mean µ, which corresponds to “fair” value.
The critical assumptions in our model are that subjects use available options to infer about the utility function and “fair market value.” We assume subjects do
so by inverting a hierarchical Bayesian generative model
(Fig. 2), where: (1) values {vi } for the set of options {i}
are drawn from a prior distribution with mean µ, and (2)
2-d attribute values for each option, oi , is generated from
vi according to a common utility function and then corrupted by observation noise. For simplicity, we use the
classical Cobb-Douglas utility function (Douglas, 1976),
(1−γ)
parameterized by γ, vi = xγi yi
. While more complex utility functions can be used, for example to take
into account variability in the relative scaling of the two
attributes, the contextual effects are not dependent on
the choice of utility function, and thus not dealt with
further here. To model observation noise, we first map
value into an indifference curve in the attribute space by
inverting the utility function, then add Gaussian noise
along the indifference curve (parameterized by θi ) and
isotrophic 2-D Gaussian noise (parameterized by σ0 ).
We expect the main results to hold independent of the
specific choices of model parameterization.
Subsequent to doing posterior inference, we assume
humans choose an option by first sampling from the joint
posterior P (v|o), and then (always) choosing the option
with the highest sampled value. The computation of the
posterior requires marginalizing over unceratinty about
market conditions through a series of steps:

Simulation details
The parameter settings for our simulations were as follows: (kµ , tµ ) = (1, 100); (aγ , bγ ) = (2, 2); σθ = 20; kv =
20; σo = 2 (see Fig. 2). The Gamma distributions were
parametrized using parameters for shape (kµ ), and scale
(tµ ), and the mean of the corresponding distribution is
given by their product (e.g., kµ · tµ ). Accordingly, the
mean of the prior distribution over µ is 100, and the
shape parameter encodes a broad uncertainty about the
true value of µ (see Fig. 4).
We finely discretized each of the variables in our model
to calculate the relevant posterior distributions numerically (analytical solutions do not exist). The option values used (see Fig. 1) were as follows: A = (40, 60), B =
(60, 40); attraction: Z = (30, 50), compromise: Z =
(80, 20), similarity: Z = (65, 35).

As Fig. 3 shows, simulations of our model reproduces
all three contextual effects: attraction, compromise, and
similarity. In particular, the model reproduces violation
of regularity in attraction effect that is also seen in human data. In all three cases, although options A and B
are equally preferred when presented as a pair (Fig. 3A),

Discussion
We presented a normative Bayesian model for why human subjects exhibit apparently irrational choice behavior in multi-attribute decision-making. We showed that
violations of the simple scalability and regularity principles need not be reflections of an irrational or suboptimal decision or valuation process, but rather rational
consequences of a decision-maker who is trying to optimize choice in a relativistic system anchored to what
is perceived to be fair. We used a normative, hierarchical Bayesian generative model to demonstrate how
the set of options themselves can be used to infer about
the landscape of available options, such as how value
is distributed in the market, how the multi-dimensional
observed attribute space is mapped to the scalar value
representation, and the distribution of observation noise.

Our model makes a number of experimentally testable
predictions about multi-attribute choice behavior. Since
presented options not only influence the immediate
choice but also general beliefs about general market conditions, our model predicts systematic consequences in
future choice behavior based on experienced choice history. For instance, subjects exposed to a number of
choices between options generally higher in one attribute
may correspondingly learn a γ that discounts this attribute more – resulting in a smaller attraction effect
for a decoy that is inferior to B in this attribute dimension compared to the other. There is some evidence
that subjects show such “context-dependent utility functions” (Drolet, Simonson, & Tversky, 2000).
Another arena for experimental exploration suggested
by this work is the transition among the different effects due to the precise positioning of the options in the
attribute space: for instance, the “similarity” decoy in
Fig. 1C could well turn into a “compromise” decoy in
Fig. 1B, if it were far enough from B. Thus, one prediction of our model is that as the decoy Z is moved away
from the option B, while maintaining a rough tradeoff
between the two attributes, the contextual effect changes
from similarity effect to compromise effect. That is, if
the decoy were exactly the same as B, preference should
shift away from B, but as the decoy is moved further
apart, preference should shift toward B. In an analogous manner, we expect to see a smooth transition between the similarity and attraction effects as the decoy
is moved away in the orthogonal, dominated direction.
Fig. 8 shows that model simulations conform to these
expectations: as the decoy is moved further along nondominated (panel A) or dominated (panel B) directions,
the model predicts a gradual evolutation from a similarity effect to the compromise and attraction effects,
respectively.

consumer decision-making, the model can be extended to
a much broader range of multi-attribute choice behavior, whenever the observer has uncertainty about how
to combine two attributes in order to compare the options. In future work, we plan to extend the current
model to explore some non-consumer choice tasks known
to exhibit context effects (Choplin & Hummel, 2005;
J. S. Trueblood, 2012; J. Trueblood, Brown, Heathcote,
& Busemeyer, n.d.).
Our approach contrasts with the class of models that
explain contextual effects based on specific architectural
or dynamic constraints on neural processing. One example is the decision field theory (DFT) model (Busemeyer
& Townsend, 1993), which assumes that the strength
of preference for each option is driven by a noisy, accumulative input and dynamical switching of “attention”
among different attribute dimensions, as well as “lateral inhibition” between the different units. A related
model (J. S. Trueblood, 2012), an extension of the multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator model (Brown &
Heathcote, 2008), employs attentional switching, a contrast mechanism (related to lateral inhibition), and sensitivity to indifference/dominance. A third model, the
competing accumulator model (Usher & McClelland,
2004), assumes loss aversion in addition to attentional
switching and lateral inhibition. The various overlapping
and nonidentical assumptions of these process models
are difficult to verify experimentally, and their computational provenance/constraints are not well understood.
This is not to say that such mechanistic models are not
useful. Ultimately, to understand how the brain implements multi-attribute choice, we need multiple levels of
analysis (Marr, 1982) that integrate both normative and
mechanistic explanations. In this vein, our work comple-

mechanistic models.
Although the model presented here succinctly and rationally accounts for contextual effects in multi-attribute
choice behavior, it is clearly not a complete theory of human preference choice. In particular, the simple model
presented here has no means of accounting for individual differences according to taste. A natural way this
arises is when people bring in different previous experiences and thus prior beliefs about the market. However,
this cannot be the whole story, as any prior difference
would be overwhelmed by sufficient data, and yet people
who have repeated exposure to the same choices do not
always converge in their preferences (e.g. office workers
who eat out at the same set of neighborhood restaurants
day after day). An important line of future enquiry is
how individual differences in preference may arise and
persist in the face of mounting, common experiences.
