Abstract
An experiment examined the effect of ‘pure’ recognition —
in the absence of concomitant evaluation — on inferences. In
the first stage of the experiment, participants indicated whether
they recognized a number of Italian and US cities. In the second stage, they decided which of two cities had the larger
population. Crucially, names of the cities were not available
in the second stage, but participants could find out whether
they had recognized them (yes/no) in the first stage of the experiment (i.e., pure recognition). Additional predictive cues
(e.g., presence/absence of a university) were also available.
Participants used the recognition cue about 50% of the time,
rarely examined it first, and used it differently as a function
of whether recognition information was binary or continuous.
Furthermore, participants used the recognition cue more often
if they recognized more items, irrespective of its predictive validity. Implications for theoretical frameworks that view inference as driven by discrete heuristics or processes of evidence–
accumulation are briefly discussed.
Keywords: Inference, heuristics, recognition, decision making.

Humans are decision makers. Throughout our lifes, we are
constantly confronted with situations that force us to make a
choice. Whether it is a preference decision, “Do I take the car
or do I walk to work?”, or a knowledge decision, “Which soccer team scored more goals last season, Borussia Dortmund
or Bayern München?”, we are evaluating alternatives.
Gigerenzer and colleagues have proposed a number of relatively simple heuristics that could help us making such decisions. In this paper, we will focus on one of the most
prominent examples: the recognition heuristic (Goldstein &
Gigerenzer, 1999, 2002; Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 2011).
In the original conceptualisation of the recognition heuristic, called take–the–best (TTB; Gigerenzer & Goldstein,
1996), the first step in deciding which of two response options to choose was to use recognition. So, if a decision maker
knows the Bayern München soccer team, but has never heard
of Borussia Dortmund, then respond that Bayern München
scored more goals last season. When both teams are recognized (thus disabling the use of recognition) the heuristic
consults relevant information, or cues, in memory that are indicative of the number of goals scored (e.g., “What was the
team’s final standing in the national competition?”). These
cues should be consulted in descending order of informativeness, starting with the cue that will be most indicative of the

criterion of interest (i.e., number of goals scored). Cue search
stops when the decision maker examines a cue that points
in one direction (i.e., Borussia Dortmund was first last season, Bayern München was second, so respond Borussia Dortmund).
This proposal for a simple mechanism based on recognition sparked a wide ranging debate about the plausibility, empirical validity, and generality of the recognition heuristic (for
recent examples see the papers in the three special issues of
the Journal of Judgment and Decision Making — Vol 6 (1)
& (5), 2011; Vol 5 (4), 2010). Much of the debate revolves
around some key assumptions about the nature and operation
of recognition in inferential judgment.
In the paper that introduced the recognition heuristic as a
stand–alone ‘tool’ (i.e. not just the first step in Take–the–
Best), Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002) assume, firstly, that
recognition is binary. That is, we either recognize something,
or we do not, and there is no room within the heuristic for
the distinction between something being vaguely familiar and
something being very familiar. Secondly, recognition is assumed to be noncompensatory. That is, when we recognize
one option, but do not recognize the other, then we should
always go with the recognized option, regardless of any additional information. Lastly, Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002)
make a distinction between familiarity and recognition: “The
term familiarity is typically used in the literature to denote
the degree of knowledge (or amount of experience) a person
has of a task or object. The recognition heuristic, in contrast, treats recognition as a binary, all–or–none distinction;
further knowledge is irrelevant.” (pp. 77). Thus, according to
a strict interpretation of the (2002 version of the) recognition
heuristic, when deciding whether an Italian city you know
has a larger population than an Italian city you do not know,
it makes no difference whether the city you do know is Rome
or Pisa.
All three of these assumptions have been roundly challenged in the literature on both empirical (e.g., Pohl, 2006;
Newell & Shanks, 2004; Newell & Fernandez, 2006) and
theoretical grounds (e.g., Hilbig, 2010; Newell, 2011). Responding to some of these critiques, Gigerenzer and Goldstein (2011) recast the adaptive use of the recognition heuristic as involving a two–step process: first recognition (“Do I

3627

recognize one object but not the other?”) and second, evaluation ( “If so, is it reasonable to rely on the recognition heuristic in this situation?”). A view consistent with that is outlined
in Newell and Shanks (2004).
While such a conceptualisation is undoubtedly more plausible, it makes the claims about the way recognition aids inference that much more difficult to define and test empirically.
Perhaps the trickiest aspect of the problem is that recognition almost always entails further information about the recognized object. If you have heard of Pisa, it is highly likely
that you know something else about it (e.g., that it has a leaning tower) which may or may not be relevant to the criterion
of interest, in this case population (cf. Oppenheimer, 2003).
In other words, it is difficult to isolate the influence of ‘pure’
recognition — how useful is just knowing that I recognize an
object for drawing an inference?
Isolating this ‘pure’ recognition — recognition without
concomitant evaluation — is important because it can shed
new light on the distinction between recognition and familiarity, and the extent to which people will rely on recognition
even when they cannot directly evaluate their reason(s) for
recognising an object. In order to isolate pure recognition
we introduced a novel element to the standard task in which
participants decide which of two cities has the larger population (e.g., Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002). In our task we
created the distinction between recognition and familiarity alluded to by Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002) by first asking
participants to provide recognition data about a pool of response options (city names). We then presented participants
with a series of forced choice decisions between two cities
about which different pieces of information could be obtained
(e.g., presence/absence of a university), but for which the city
names were unavailable. Although participants could not discover the names they could — crucially — discover whether
or not they had recognized one, both or neither of the cities
when they had been presented in the first stage of the experiment. This information was available in the same manner
as all the other cues — that is via clicking on relevant buttons (“Did you recognize this city when you were shown its
name?”) to reveal a yes/no answer (see Figure 1).

An additional feature of the experiment was that we offered participants (between–subjects) the opportunity to use
recognition as a binary (yes/no) or a continuous (slider from
0 to 100) cue. If it is true that recognition operates in a binary
fashion, participants should only use the endpoints of a scale
when asked to give a continuous rating of their recognition.
Similarly, the usage of the recognition cue should not differ
between a condition in which it was indicated as binary and a
condition in which it was indicated as continuous.
In the next section, we will describe the experiment and
each of its conditions in greater detail. Then, we will present
some results and conclude on both the tenability of the recognition heuristic, and the use of recognition as an aid to inference more generally.

Method
Participants
All participants were first year undergraduate students at the
University of New South Wales who participated in return
for course credit. A total of 100 participants (62 females, 38
males), aged 17 to 39 (mean = 19.5, SD = 2.9) took part in
the experiment. They were randomly divided between four
between–subject conditions (n = 25 each).

Material
The tasks we used for this experiment are based on the German cities task (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996) in which over
the course of consecutive trials, a participant has to decide
which of two cities has the larger population. This decision
can be made by extracting information on different cues in
any order. An example of such a cue could be “Is this city
the national capital?”. Rather than using German cities, we
administered an Italian cities environment and a US cities environment to each participant (see Lee & Zhang, 2012), expecting to see higher recognition percentages for the US cities
than for the Italian cities.
Table 1: The nine cues as used in the Italian and US cities
environments. Env = Environment, Val = Cue Validity, Dis =
Cue Discriminability.

A key question here is: How often and when do participants examine the ‘pure’ recognition cue when drawing an
inference? Will recognition remain a primary driver of decisions (cf., Pachur & Hertwig, 2006) even in the absence
of evaluation? In a sense, the use of recognition in this task
allows us to gain insight into participants’ meta–cognitions
about the usefulness of recognition in different environments.
For example, do decision makers use recognition more often
as they recognize more items in a pool of response categories,
irrespective of the informativeness of recognition? To facilitate examining these questions we presented each participant
with two decision environments in which we assumed he or
she would know a different proportion of the items, thereby
allowing us to directly compare response strategies: a US
cities environment and an Italian cities environment.

In the first stage of the experiment, participants indicate

3628

whether or not they recognize each of the cities used in the
subsequent stage of the experiment. In a between participants
manipulation, recognition was either measured as a binary or
as a continuous variable. Taking the Italian environment as
an example, in the binary condition participants were asked
“Do you recognize this city in Italy” for a total of 66 Italian
cities with response options “yes” or “no”. In the continuous
condition, participants were asked “How well do you recognize this city in Italy”. Answers were indicated on a slider
going from 0 (“I am certain that I do not recognize this city”)
through 50 (“I am not sure whether or not I recognize this
city”) to 100 (“I am certain that I recognize this city”).
In the second stage of the experiment, participants were
asked “Which Italian city has a higher population?”. The participant could choose between A and B, both of which represented Italian cities the participant had provided recognition
data on in the first stage of the experiment. As noted in the introduction, our key focus is on investigating pure recognition
without associated knowledge of the response options and
thus we effectively disabled internal memory–based search
by concealing the names of each city. In order to aid the
decision making process, participants were presented with a
number of cues on screen for which they can retrieve information.1 Crucially, one of the cues the participant could access was the recognition cue of which data was provided in
the first stage of the experiment. A screenshot of the second
stage of the experiment is provided in Figure 1.
The final manipulation in our experiment consisted of the
availability of information on two key aspects of each cue.
These are each cues’ validity and discriminability. The validity of a cue quantifies the number of times a cue points you
to the right answer as a ratio of the times it discriminates between the two response options. For instance, in the Italian
cities Environment, the cue “Is the city the national capital?”
has a validity of 1, because whenever one alternative scores
positive on this cue, that will be because that alternative is
the city Rome and Rome is the largest Italian city. The discriminability of a cue quantifies the number of times a cue
discriminates between two response alternatives as a ratio of
all possible cue comparisons for each question. The national
capital cues does not discriminate very often and therefore
has a low discriminability, because this cue will only discriminate when one of the two response alternatives is Rome. In
the “+info” condition, cue validity and discriminability was
shown on screen, in the “-info” condition, this information
was not available to the participant. Note that for the continuous recognition cue, the cue discriminates if both scores
are different from eachother. Thus, if one cue scores 0, it
makes no difference whether the other scores 1 or 100. This
manipulation was included to examine whether provision of
information about the usefulness of recognition, in particular,
affected its use. The validity and discriminabilty information
can be seen as an aid to answering the meta–cognitive ques1 This is different from the original German cities task, in which
cues had to be retrieved from memory and city names were revealed.

tion facing the participant — i.e., how useful is knowing that
I recognize an object for drawing an inference?
All cues and their validities and discriminabilities for both
environments are shown in Table 1. These cue validity and
cue discriminability rates were calculated for the subset of
100 comparisons the participants had to make in the task,
rather than for the whole set of possible comparisons. The
reason for this was to ensure that participants in the “+info”
condition could relate the presented cue validity and cue discriminability rates as close as possible to their actual experience when performing the task. The presented information
could be used by participants to base their search order on
cue validity, cue discriminability or a combination of the two.
After each trial, participants received feedback with respect
to the accuracy of their response. The experiment was self–
paced.

Figure 1: Screenshot of a trial of the binary version of the US
cities task with cue information present (“+info”). See text
for details.
Cues were presented in a circular array on the screen in
random order. Participants examined cues by clicking on
them. The order in which buttons were clicked was self–
controlled. Deciding to stop examining additional cues was
self–controlled, but conditional on having encountered at
least one discriminating cue to dissuade guessing.

Procedure
Participants completed the Italian version and the US version
of the task in random order. Participants were given instructions that they would have to indicate whether or not they recognized a number of cities, after which they performed stage
1 of the experiment, the recognition phase. Participants were
subsequently instructed that they repeatedly had to make a
choice between pairs of two alternatives. The concepts cue
validity and cue discriminability were explained. Participants
then performed the second stage of the experiment. After
completing the experiment for the first environment, the second environment was administered.

Our experiment consists of eight conditions. The cities environment was a within–subject manipulation with two levels:
Italian and US. The recognition mode was a between–subject
manipulation with two levels: binary and continuous. Cue
information was a between–subject manipulation with two
levels: +info (info present on screen) and -info (no info on
screen).

For all statistical analyses, we report not only conventional p–
values but also Bayes factors (e.g., Jeffreys, 1961). In contrast
to p–values, Bayes factors allow researchers to quantify evidence in favor of the null hypothesis vis–a–vis the alternative
hypothesis. For instance, when the Bayes factor BF01 = 10
the observed data are 10 times more likely to have occurred
under H0 than under H1 . When BF01 = 1/5 = 0.20 the observed data are 5 times more likely to have occurred under
H1 than under H0 . In the following, Bayes factors for analysis of variance are based on the BIC approximation (e.g.,
Wagenmakers, 2007; Masson, 2011), and Bayes factors for
t–tests are based on the default Bayesian t–test proposed by
Rouder, Speckman, Sun, Morey, and Iverson (2009).
We ran a 2x2x2 ANOVA with mode and cue information
as between–subject independent variables and environment
as a within–subject independent variable. Response accuracy
was higher in the Italian environment (73.9%) than in the US
environment (69.2%; F(1, 96) = 78.5, p < .05, BF01 = 1.1 ·
10−12 ). The following subsections report on the recognition
proportion, the recognition validity and discriminabillity, and
the recognition usage respectively.

Figure 2 shows the proportion of cities that were recognized
for each environment. As expected, recognition was higher
for the US cities environment than for the Italian cities environment, as evidenced by a main effect for environment
(F(1, 96) = 298.9, p < .05, BF01 = 2.0 · 10−30 ; cf., Goldstein
& Gigerenzer, 2002). Continuous recognition led to some
parts of the scale being used besides the two extremes, suggesting that participants did not treat recognition as purely
binary. However, the extremes were still the most popular.

Recall that the validity and discriminability of the recognition cue was calculated for each participant separately based
on their answers in stage 1 of the experiment. Based on the
recognition proportion for each environment, we expected to
find that recognition was more valid, but less discriminating,
for the Italian environment than for the US environment (cf.,
Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002). We were interested to see
how cue mode would affect cue validity and discriminability.

We have established there are differences in the validity
and discriminability of the recognition cue that are a direct
consequence of the cue being binary or continuous: recognition discriminates between response alternatives more often,
but the extra information is, tentatively, less valid. Do decision makers use the recognition cue differently depending on
the mode of the cue?

Conclusion
The goal of our experiment was to isolate ‘pure’ recognition
and to examine participants’ use of recognition information
in the absence of concomitant evaluation. We argued that this
would give us insight into participants’ meta–cognition about
the usefulness of recognition in different environments. What
have we learned?
First we note that the accuracy of inferences about population size was higher for an environment about which participants, initially, knew less (Italian cities) than for one about

no recognition position data. Recognition position was divided by
the total number of cues for each environment to make both environments compatible.

The top panels of Figure 4 show the proportion of trials the
recognition cue was used for each environment. On average,
participants did not use the recognition cue on all trials. On
an individual basis, 9% of the participants used the recognition cue on all trials in the Italian environment and 8% of the
participants used the recognition cue on all trials in the US
environment.
For recognition use, there was a main effect of mode
(F(1, 96) = 9.4, p < .05, BF01 = 0.09); decision makers use
continuous recognition more than binary recognition. There
was also a main effect of environment (F(1, 96) = 22.8,
p < .05, BF01 = 2.4 · 10−4 ), decision makers use the recognition cue more in the US environment than in the Italian environment. Interestingly, there was a mode by environment
interaction (F(1, 96) = 4.0, BF01 = 1.33). In the Italian environment, recognition is used more often if it is continuous
than if it is binary (t(98) = −3.65, p < .05, BF01 = 0.02). In
the US environment, recognition usage does not depend on
the mode of the cue (t(98) = −1.52, p > .05, BF01 = 2.21;
note that the Bayesian test indicates the evidence is somewhat
ambiguous). It is likely then, that the benefits of continuous
recognition are highest when only a small portion of items are
recognized. Finally, there is little evidence for a main effect
of cue information (F(1, 96) = 3.3, p > .05, BF01 = 1.88; but
note that the Bayesian test indicates the evidence is somewhat
ambiguous).
The bottom panels of Figure 4 show the average position
in which the recognition cue was searched, given that it was
examined for each environment. On average, participants did
not search the recognition cue first. On an individual basis,
for both environments, the lowest mean position of examination for the recognition cue was exactly 2, suggesting that not
a single individual used the recognition heuristic in its most
stringent form.
For recognition position, there was a main effect of mode
(F(1, 95) = 4.5, p < .05, BF01 = 0.08)2 ; recognition was used
earlier when it was binary than when it was continuous. There
was no main effect of environment (F(1, 94) = 2.1, p > .05,
BF01 = 3.27)

which they knew more (US cities). But was the difference
driven by adaptive use of recognition information? Under
a strict interpretation, even in our novel task, recognition
should be consulted on every trial — unless a participant has
reason to believe that it will never discriminate (e.g., if they
know they recognized either all or none of the cities in the
environment). The results showed that was clearly not the
case, with only a small proportion of the participants using
the recognition cue on all trials. Moreover, even the participants that did examine recognition on every trial did not
exclusively examine this cue first, challenging the idea that
recognition information is somehow privileged in inference
tasks (e.g., Pachur & Hertwig, 2006).
Additionally, we examined whether we could increase usage of recognition by measuring recognition on a continuous
rather than a binary scale. We concluded that for the Italian
environment where only a small proportion of the items were
recognized, measuring recognition on a continuous scale led
to recognition being used more often, despite the fact that
recognition was less valid for the continuous scale than for the
binary scale. No such effect was found for the US environment, in which on average about half of the cities were recognized. Though it is possible that the intermediate datapoints
on the continuous recognition scale simply reflect perceived
task demands by the participants, this alternative explanation
does not seem to be in line with the fact that participants subsequently use continuous recognition more.
Our final question was whether participants would use
recognition more often when their recognition cue was more
valid. Surprisingly, we concluded the opposite: recognition was used more frequently in the US environment than
in the Italian environment, despite the fact that recognition
was more valid, on average, in the Italian environment. This
finding suggests that meta–cognition about the usefulness of
recognition is not particularly fine–tuned: adaptive use of
recognition would predict greater reliance in environments
where it is more useful (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 2011).

3631

Thus we conclude that ‘pure’ recognition can be compensated: knowing that we recognized one object and not another, but not knowing why is not enough for most participants to make a decision. Furthermore, it is not the first piece
of information participants search for. In addition, our results
show that recognition is more than a binary yes–or–no phenomenon. Allowing participants to indicate their recognition
on a continuous scale led to an average increase in usage.
These results provide a novel and intriguing set of empirical regularities concerning the use of pure recognition
information in a multi–attribute decision task. The next
stage of this project will draw on the considerable advances
that have been made in developing computational models of
recognition–based judgments (e.g., Marewski & Mehlhorn,
2011; Marewski & Schooler, 2011) in an attempt to describe
these data more fully. Our starting point will be to compare
models that assume recognition information is used as evidence that can be accumulated much like any other cue to
aid inference (e.g., van Ravenzwaaij, Moore, Lee, & Newell,
2013) with those that afford recognition an elevated status.
