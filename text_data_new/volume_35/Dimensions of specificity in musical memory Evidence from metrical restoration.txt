Abstract

On first glance, a simple answer to both questions is degree
of similarity: listeners generalize to similar musical patterns,
and maintain specific representations of less-similar
patterns. However, determining equivalent degrees of
similarity on varied dimensions is not trivial, as perceivers’
use of dimensions can change depending on task and
attentional factors (Nosofsky, 1986). That is, we do not
know what weights listeners assign to different dimensions
in musical memory. Further, some dimensions may be
processed integrally, such that their combined effect is not a
simple sum of their individual effects. The current study
aims to explore the relative strength of various auditorymusical properties on metrical restoration, providing
insights into similarity-based organization in musical
memory.

How is musical memory organized? While classic studies of
music perception appealed to schematic or symbolic
knowledge structures, recent work suggests that listeners form
highly-detailed auditory representations of music. Studies of
metrical restoration—memory fill-in of the “beat” of a
metrically-ambiguous melody—suggest some organizing
dimensions in musical memory. However, many potential
dimensions remain unexplored. The current study looked for
effects of mode (major vs. minor)—a substantial organizing
force in Western music—and timbre (what instrument is
playing) on metrical restoration. Both mode and timbre can
signify particular musical styles. In Experiment 1, listeners
showed timbre specificity in metrical restoration, but not
mode specificity. However, in Experiment 2, when timbres
were extremely unique (one per melody), restoration effects
were not observed, suggesting that too much variability leads
to diffuse representations which are too weak to support
metrical restoration. Implications for the nature of musical
memory are discussed.

Introduction
Recent research suggests that listeners form rich, detailed
representations of perceptual information. These details later
facilitate recognition (Creel, Aslin, & Tanenhaus, 2008;
Goldinger, 1998; Gjerdingen & Perrott, 2008; Krumhansl,
2010; Schellenberg et al., 1999) and allow fill-in of
ambiguous or absent information (Creel, 2011, 2012;
Samuel, 1981). In music particularly, Creel (2011, 2012)
has shown that listeners who hear particular metrical (or
harmonic) information with a melody will later, upon
hearing the melody alone, fill in the missing contextual
information (harmony or meter) previously heard with that
melody.
These findings are interesting in a number of respects.
First, meter is a property previously thought to be largely
signal-driven, with listeners extracting metrical regularities
via statistical analysis of the signal itself. Creel’s work
suggests that memory influences meter perception. Second,
these findings suggest that similarity-based organization of
detailed auditory-temporal memories can support
knowledge of distinct genres, such as different musical
styles or different languages.
Yet many questions remain. What factors allow listeners
to keep particular musical patterns distinct in memory—
what keeps them from bleeding together? Inversely, what
factors allow listeners to generalize metrical information?

Figure 1. First four measures of a melody, in (a) major key
with 6/8 metrical context; (b) minor key with 3/4 metrical
context. Metrical grids indicate perceived emphasis in each
meter: large X’s denote strong beats, small x’s weaker beats,
and .’s indicate the subdivision of each beat. Beat
subdivisions are identical in duration in both versions.

Known influences on metrical restoration
Previous work in my lab (Creel, 2011, 2012) has examined
some factors in memory restoration of meter. In those
experiments, as well as the new experiments described here,

2106

I exploit the 3/4 – 6/8 ambiguity, a musical “ambiguous
figure.” Certain musical passages with repeating series of 6
sub-beats can be interpreted as being in 3/4 meter (beats
alternating evenly with sub-beats, X . x . x .) or in 6/8 meter
(each beat is followed by two sub-beats: X . . x . . ). Figure 1
shows examples of each meter.
In my experiments, each listener heard a set of 8-12
melodies. Half were presented in a musical context
suggesting 3/4, and half in a context suggesting 6/8.
Melodies were constructed to fit either metrical pattern,
allowing a carefully counterbalanced design where, across
listeners, each melody was heard in each meter equally
often (Table 1). A listener heard each melody multiple times
during an exposure phase. Next, all listeners heard each
melody without its meter-implying context, followed by
probe drumbeats in either 3/4 or 6/8. They were asked to
rate how well the drumbeats fit with the preceding melody.
The question was whether listeners would provide higher
ratings for the drumbeats (meters) that matched the contexts
that they had previously heard.
Table 1: Example conditions in a metrical restoration
experiment. If listeners restore melodies’ metrical contexts,
then Listener 1 should provide higher probe ratings to the
shaded probe trials, and Listener 2 should provide higher
probe ratings to the unshaded probe trials.

In Creel (2011, Experiment 2), listeners heard a set of 8
melodies that were very distinct from each other in terms of
timbre, note rate (speed), mode (major, minor, other), and
rhythmic patterns. Listeners provided higher ratings for
drumbeat probes that matched the contexts they had heard
with those specific melodies during the exposure phase.
This suggests melody-specific memory for meter.
A second study (Creel, 2012) examined the role of crossmelody similarity on metrical restoration, and so presented
melodies with a stronger similarity structure: two timbres, a
single note rate, and similar rhythmic patterns across
melodies. Listeners associated metrical information with
timbre: they showed metrical restoration for a melody
played in its original timbre, but not when it was played in
the other timbre (as long as timbre and meter patterned
consistently across melodies). Further, when melodies were
constructed from two different sets of motifs (defined in that
study as brief rhythm+contour patterns), listeners showed

metrical restoration for new melodies with those motifs
(Experiment 5).
Interestingly, the magnitude of the metrical restoration
effects in the 2011 study was much larger than the effect in
Creel (2012). Though there were a number of differences
between the two sets of studies, one possibility is that the
denser similarity structure of the melodies in the second
paper led to greater generalization, but, conversely, less
individuation. However, it is not clear which one (or more)
of the unique properties of the melodies in the 2011 paper
generated such strong restoration effects: rate, timbre, mode,
rhythmic patterns. Do all dimensions of variation contribute
additively to specificity/individuation in memory, or is one
particular factor the “smoking gun”?

Unknown effects on metrical restoration
As seen in Creel (2011, 2012), timbre and motif content
seem to be integral to musical memory. That is, metrical
restoration shows timbre specificity and motif specificity.
However, numerous dimensions of substantial musictheoretical importance remain untested. First, is there mode
specificity? Mode, the particular pitch collection used in a
musical piece, may be a signature of musical style: in
Western music, the most common modes are major and
minor. Other musical styles and cultures are characterized
by yet other pitch collections (e.g. Castellano et al., 1984).
Mode also contributes to emotional processing: Western
listeners associate the major mode with happiness, and the
minor mode with sadness (e.g. Hunter et al., 2008).
A second factor not previously examined is rate—the
speed at which a musical piece is executed. Do listeners
store melodies rate-specifically?
Finally, the role of timbre bears further exploration. Is
timbre simply one of many cues that differentiate music in
memory? If hearing melodies in two timbres allows listeners
to keep metrical patterns distinct, then does hearing
melodies in even more timbres create even more distinct
metrical representations?

The current study
The current study examined influences of mode, rate, and
timbre on the metrical restoration effect. Experiment 1
asked whether differences in mode (major or minor), alone
or in combination with timbre cues, show specificity effects
in metrical restoration. Experiment 2 asked whether
maximal differences in timbre (1 vs. 12 timbres), and
differences in rate, allow even more specificity in memory.

Experiment 1
The first experiment compares metrical restoration as a
function of timbre-specificity (shown in Creel, 2012) and
mode-specificity (not yet explored). We know that listeners
show timbre-specific metrical restoration when timbre
patterns consistently with meter. Does mode serve a similar
function? That is, if mode patterns consistently with meter
(e.g. major melodies are always heard in 3/4, minor
melodies in 6/8), will listeners only restore the meter when a

2107

melody is heard in its original mode? Further, do timbre and
mode combine additively to provide even more distinct
musical memories, and even stronger restoration effects?

Method
Participants N=107 participants from the UCSD human
participant pool received course credit for participation.
Roughly equal numbers of participants took part in
Experiments 1a (n=36), 1b (n=35), and 1c (n=36).
Stimuli The 18 melodies used here were originally used in
Experiments 1-3 of Creel (2012). Melodies were edited
slightly to generate clearer metrical contexts. The originals
were all composed in major mode. Minor-mode versions
were created by lowering the pitch of scale degree 3, and 6
and 7 in certain contexts, by ½ step, or about 6%. Melodies
were exported from Finale software (MakeMusic, Inc.) in
the key of C, played both in a vibraphone timbre and a
muted-trumpet timbre. These two timbres were chosen to be
highly distinct, based on Iverson and Krumhansl’s (1993)
perceptual scaling study of timbres.
Design Each participant heard only 12 of the 18 melodies
during exposure. Test trials presented all 18 melodies, with
manipulations as described below (examples in Table 2). All
melodies were presented during the test phase followed by
metrical probe drumbeats in 6/8 and 3/4.
Experiment 1a: different timbres. There was a consistent
mapping of timbre to meter. For example, a participant
might hear six major-mode vibraphone melodies in 3/4, and
six major-mode muted-trumpet melodies in 6/8. A given
participant heard only one mode (major or minor). Test
trials presented each melody four times: two probe meters
(original meter, other meter) x two timbres (original timbre,
other timbre). Mode did not change from training to test.
Experiment 1b: different modes. There was a consistent
mapping of mode to meter. For example, a participant might
hear six major-mode vibraphone melodies in a 3/4 metrical
context, six minor-mode vibraphone melodies in a 6/8
metrical context. Thus, the roles of mode and timbre were
reversed relative to Experiment 1a. Test trials presented
each melody four times: two probe meters (original meter or
other meter) x two modes (original mode or other mode).
Timbre did not change from training to test.
Experiment 1c: different mode+timbre combinations.
There was a consistent mapping of timbre and mode to
meter. For example, a participant might hear six majormode vibraphone melodies in 3/4, and six minor-mode
muted-trumpet melodies in 6/8. Thus, 3/4 melodies all had
the same mode and timbre, while 6/8 melodies had the other
mode and timbre, giving listeners two attributes to link to
metrical information. Test trials presented each melody four
times: twice for each probe meter, with either the original
mode+timbre combination or the opposite mode+timbre
combination.

Procedure The experiment was run in Matlab using
Psychtoolbox3 (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997). Sounds were
presented via Sennheiser HD 280 headphones. Before the
experiment proper, listeners completed a questionnaire on
their academic and performing music experiences. They
then went on to an exposure phase, followed by a test phase.
The exposure phase presented each of 12 melodies 6
times each (72 trials total). On each trial, listeners were
asked to rate, by clicking in a 2-dimensional grid, the
melody’s affective quality (sad to happy, on the x-axis) and
their subjective judgment of it (like to dislike, on the yaxis). This cover task aimed to keep participants attentive
without alerting them to attend specifically to the meter.
They were not told that they would later be tested on their
knowledge of the melodies.
After exposure, participants were asked to rate drumbeats
following each melody. Before beginning the test, they were
presented with four example drumbeat probe trials, in order:
four bars of Happy Birthday (3/4 meter) followed by “good”
drumbeats (in 3/4); Happy Birthday followed by “bad”
drumbeats (in 6/8); four bars of Greensleeves (6/8 meter)
followed by “good” drumbeats (in 6/8); Greensleeves
followed by “bad” drumbeats (in 3/4). They were prompted
to consult the experimenter if they had any questions. After
this, they proceeded to the test phase.
The test phase presented all 12 melodies that the
participant had heard during learning, plus the 6 held-out
melodies. Each melody was presented four times: once in
the original mode and timbre followed by 3/4 probe
drumbeats (4 measures plus a downbeat, or 13 beats); once
in original mode and timbre with 6/8 drumbeats (4 measures
plus a downbeat, or 9 beats); once in the other mode and/or
timbre with 3/4 drumbeats; and once in the other mode
and/or timbre with 6/8 drumbeats. For each participant, the
mode/timbre and meter either matched or mismatched the
contexts they had heard at training.

Results
All ratings were converted from raw pixel values to a
scale ranging from -1 to +1 to allow easier interpretation.
Cover task Participants rated liking and affective content
during exposure. Participants rated major melodies happier
than minor melodies (1a: between-participants: t(33)=4.79,
p<.0001; 1b: t(35)=15.07, p<.0001; 1c: t(35)=11.30,
p<.0001). These ratings differences suggest that participants
were attentive during exposure, and further, that they readily
distinguished major and minor modes from each other.

2108

Experiment 1a. To determine whether probe ratings
differed as a function of prior exposure and instrument
match, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on probe ratings
was conducted with Exposure Meter (3/4 or 6/8), Probe
Meter (3/4 or 6/8), and Timbre (original, switched) as
within-participants factors. Bear in mind that, if there is a
metrical restoration effect, then the interaction of Exposure
Meter x Probe Meter should be significant. If restoration
was timbre-specific—that is, if restoration was stronger
when the melody was presented in the original timbre—then
there should be a three-way interaction. For ease of
interpretation, the restoration effect (Figures 2 and 3) is
plotted in this paper as the average difference between the
exposed probes (Exposure=3/4, Probe=3/4; 6/8, 6/8) and the
unexposed probes (Exposure=3/4, Probe=6/8; 6/8, 3/4).
An Exposure Meter x Probe Meter interaction (F(1,34)=
5.30, p=.03) verified an overall metrical restoration effect.
An interaction of Exposure Meter x Probe Meter x Timbre
(F(1,34)=4.57, p=.04) suggested differences in metrical
restoration as a function of timbre match. Considering each
timbre individually, the Exposure Meter x Probe Meter
interaction was only significant for original-timbre trials
(F(1,34)=9.29, p=.004), but not for switched-timbre trials
(F(1,34)=.06, p=.80). This replicates previous work (Creel,
2012) suggesting that, when meter and timbre covary,
listeners do not generalize metrical restoration across a
timbre change. Data from “new” melodies (heard for the
first time at test) are not discussed due to space restrictions.
Experiment 1b. An ANOVA was conducted on probe
ratings with Exposure Meter, Probe Meter, and Mode
(original or switched) as factors. The ANOVA showed an
Exposure Meter x Probe Meter interaction (F(1,35) = 6.84,
p = .01), consistent with metrical restoration. If restoration
was mode-specific, there should be a significant Exposure
Meter x Probe Meter x Mode interaction. However, this
interaction did not approach significance (F(1,35)=0.00,
p=.98), implying that there was no decrement in metrical
restoration when a melody was presented in the opposite
mode as in training. Bearing this out, the Exposure Meter x
Probe Meter interaction was significant for original-mode
(F(1,35)=4.76, p=.04) and switched-mode (F(1,35)=4.66,
p=.04) trials individually. This suggests that, in contrast to
timbre specificity, listeners do not show mode specificity,
but rather mode generality, in meter perception.
Experiment 1c. One might wonder if mode, while not
showing specificity effects alone, might augment a timbrespecificity effect. An ANOVA with Exposure Meter, Probe
Meter, and Mode+Timbre Combination (original, switched)
was conducted on probe ratings. An Exposure Meter x
Probe Meter interaction (F(1,35)=4.44, p=.04) suggested an
overall metrical restoration effect. The Exposure Meter x
Probe Meter x Mode+Timbre Combination interaction did
not approach significance (F(1,35)=0.68, p=.42). However,
considering each mode+timbre combination individually
suggested that the metrical restoration effect was carried by

original mode+timbre trials (significant Exposure Meter x
Probe Meter interaction, F(1,35)=4.65, p=.04), rather than
switched mode+timbre trials (not significant; F(1,35)=0.46,
p=.50). This is numerically consistent with timbre
specificity, as in Experiment 1a and Creel (2012). However,
it is not at all consistent with stronger specificity effects
when both mode and timbre pattern with meter.

Figure 2: Experiment 1, metrical restoration as a function
of whether the melody was presented in its original mode
and timbre, or in a different mode and/or timbre.

Discussion
Experiment 1 replicated previous findings of timbre-specific
metrical restoration (Creel, 2012). However, metrical
restoration seems to generalize readily across a change in
mode. Given the theoretical and affective importance of the
major/minor mode distinction, and listeners’ demonstrated
sensitivity to the affective connotations of mode in the
affect-rating cover task, this is somewhat surprising. One
possible explanation is that, while harmonic cues to mode in
the context were quite strong, cues to mode in the melody
alone were weaker. (Note that timbre cues were still
available in the melody alone.) If so, stronger harmonic
contexts might reveal evidence of mode-specific metrical
restoration. Another possibility is that in real musical styles,
other factors that covary with mode carry the weight of
mode’s apparent stylistic impact. For instance, minor-mode
melodies might use particular note sequences that are rare in
major-mode melodies, and vice versa. Because the melodies
used here were changed to minor mode simply by shifting
certain pitches down by a small amount, no such stylistic
differences were evident here.

Experiment 2
While Experiment 1 found no effects of mode on metrical
restoration, there were effects of timbre: listeners did not
generalize metrical restoration across a change in timbre.
One might take this to imply that timbre differences alone
could be used to keep different musical styles separate from
one another. If this were true, then even more diversity
should lead to highly-specific metrical storage. The current
experiment addressed this hypothesis.

2109

Listeners were exposed to 12 3/4 and 6/8 melodies either
in a single timbre, or in 12 different timbres (one per
melody). If more timbres yields more distinct melody
representations, then twelve-timbre listeners should show
stronger metrical restoration than one-timbre listeners.
Crossed with this was a rate-variability manipulation:
listeners heard melodies at a single presentation rate, or in
three different rates (consistent for a particular melody). If
listeners store melodies rate-specifically, then multiple rates
should yield more distinct representations, and hence,
stronger metrical restoration.

Method
Participants N=72 listeners from the UCSD human
participant pool took part in the experiment.

Discussion

Stimuli Stimuli were 12 major-mode melodies, a subset of
those in Experiment 1. The 12 timbres were selected to be
discriminable (Iverson & Krumhansl, 1993) and to span
multiple instrument families (percussion, strings, brass,
woodwinds) which have timbres similar to each other. For a
given participant, each melody had a single rate and timbre.
Design Participants were randomly assigned to one of four
combinations of timbre variability (1 timbre or 12) and rate
(1 rate or 3). Timbres and rates were counterbalanced such
that each timbre, rate, and timbre-rate combination occurred
roughly equally across participants and melodies.
Procedure The procedure was identical to that in
Experiment 1, except for differences in the stimuli heard.

However, none of the higher-level interactions—which
would indicate timbre diversity or rate diversity effects—
were significant: Exposure Meter x Probe Meter x Timbre
(F(1,68)=2.47, p=.12), Exposure Meter x Probe Meter x
Rate (F(1,68)=0.58, p=.45), or Exposure Meter x Probe
Meter x Timbre x Rate (F(1,68)=0.34, p=.56). Further, the
direction of the Timbre interaction effect was numerically
opposite that predicted: metrical restoration was more robust
for listeners who heard a single timbre than for those who
heard 12 different timbres. Individually, metrical restoration
was significant only in the two single-timbre conditions (novariability: F(1,17)=14.64, p=.001; rate-variability: F(1,17)
=7.25, p=.02). Thus, the strongest evidence for metrical
restoration was carried by the low-diversity conditions.

Figure 3: Experiment 2, metrical restoration effect as a
function of timbre and rate variability.

The results of Experiment 2 were counter to predictions
of timbre specificity and rate specificity. There was no
effect of rate diversity, which one might think would be
closely linked to meter as both properties emerge from
musical timing. Further, instead of stronger metrical
restoration when each melody had a unique timbre, metrical
restoration was numerically smaller—absent—when each
melody had a unique timbre. Why wouldn’t 12 moredistinct melodies (12 unique timbres) generate stronger
metrical restoration, due to specificity, than 12 less-distinct
(identical-timbre) melodies?
One possible answer is that listeners were not associating
timbres themselves with meter, but were associating timbrespecific motifs with meters. That is, listeners were
aggregating traces that grouped according to perceptual
similarity. Recall that Creel (2012) showed that motif
similarity influenced metrical restoration. Suppose that
listeners in the current experiment also associated meter
with motif-like rhythmic patterns. The melodies in the
current study were built from a small set of moderatelyambiguous rhythmic patterns, many of which occurred
across multiple melodies. If the same rhythmic patterns
were stored separately for separate timbres, then listeners
who heard few timbres (Experiment 1; one-timbre condition
of Experiment 2) might build up relatively strong motif
representations. On the other hand, listeners who heard
multiple timbres (the 12-timbre condition of Experiment 2)
would store a larger number of timbre-specific motif
representations, but these would be weaker because they had
been exposed too few times. Thus, the 12-timbre condition
may have yielded motif representations that were too weak
to generate significant metrical restoration.

Results
Metrical restoration (Figure 3) was assessed in an
ANOVA on probe ratings with Exposure Meter and Probe
Meter as within-participants factors, and Timbre (one or
twelve) and Rate (one or three) as between-subjects factors.
As in Experiment 1, an Exposure Meter x Probe Meter
interaction (F(1,68)=14.52, p=.0003) indicated a metrical
restoration effect overall.

General Discussion
I began by asking what factors influence metrical
restoration. Experiment 1 suggests that timbre may be a
stronger influence than mode (major vs. minor), at least in
listening situations with limited harmonic information.
Further, Experiment 2 suggests that similarity-based
grouping of musical memory by timbre may decrease
metrical restoration due to too little representational overlap.

2110

Listeners may need many repetitions of motifs in a given
timbre (and perhaps in a given rate) for metrical restoration
to occur. As shown in Creel (2012), too much motif overlap
between two meters blocks metrical restoration. The current
study suggests that too little timbre-specific motif overlap in
melodic patterns may also thwart metrical restoration.
However, I hypothesize that this occurs for two different
reasons: too much motif+timbre overlap between meters
causes interference, while too little timbre-specific motif
overlap within a meter yields representations too weak to
generate restoration.
Ongoing work explores the roles of pattern (motif)
overlap in metrical restoration. When Experiment 2
presented listeners with multiple rhythmic motifs in diverse
timbres—i.e., rhythmic motifs were scattered across
melodies and timbres—no metrical restoration was found. A
new experiment (N=96 participants) again uses multiple
timbres, but each rhythmic motif is in the same timbre,
which should boost representation strength by increasing
representational overlap. The magnitude of metrical
restoration is .23, far exceeding (nonsignificant) diversetimbre restoration observed in Experiment 2. This suggests
that timbre uniqueness does not inhibit metrical restoration
as long as timbres and motifs consistently cooccur. Whether
distinct timbres facilitate motif encoding is still unknown.

The nature of musical memory
These results speak not only to restoration of metrical
information, but also to the organization of musical memory
itself. I have argued previously (Creel, 2012) that fine
auditory detail in musical memory is not an
epiphenomenon, but an organizing force, where similaritybased grouping leads to emergent clusters in memory which
shape recognition and processing. Like the “phoneme
restoration effect” (Samuel, 1981), metrical restoration and
other varieties of musical restoration (harmonic; Creel,
2011) indicate the strength of memory in the processing of
auditory events. While the incoming signal itself certainly
shapes music processing, memory too is a sizable influence
on perception. My studies thus far suggest that musical
memory is organized along at least two dimensions: timbre
and motif. Future work should assess additional factors in
metrical restoration, and also whether metrical restoration
and other types of musical restoration—particularly,
harmonic restoration—are influenced by the same musical
dimensions. If they are not, this might suggest differing
attentional weights across dimensions (Nosofsky, 1986) for
processing of metrical vs. harmonic information.
An additional question concerns the nature of motifs.
Motif structure appears to be a strong organizing force in
musical memory, but it is unclear what, functionally, counts
as a motif. Creel (2012) defined it as a rhythmic pattern with
a particular pitch contour, but many other possibilities are
equally consistent with the data: a rhythmic pattern alone;
clusters of similar but not identical rhythmic patterns.
Finally, these investigations have implications for other
temporal perception phenomena. For instance, Brochard et

al. (2003) showed an ERP signature of listeners’ illusory
perception of strong-weak alternations in a series of tones of
equal amplitude. The research described here suggests that
this effect may arise from memory activation of duple
meters, the most common meter in Western music. Future
studies of restoration effects should continue to reveal how
temporal events are represented in the mind.
