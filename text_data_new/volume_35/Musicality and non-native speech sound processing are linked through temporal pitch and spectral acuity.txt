Abstract

native sound processing, especially because different types
of acoustic information may be important for distinguishing
different types of speech sounds. Specifically, the
perception of vowels, which differ in spectral information
associated with the first and second formants, should be
most strongly predicted by sensitivity to timbre. In contrast,
the perception of consonants, which are often distinguished
by temporal information such as Voice Onset Time or
formant transitions, should benefit from sensitivity to rapid
temporal changes. Finally, lexical tones require sensitivity
to pitch and, to the extent that they encompass differences in
pitch contour, also sensitivity to temporal information.
Thus, different aspects of auditory sensory acuity may be
important for the processing of different types of non-native
speech sounds. So far, the relationship between musicality
and non-native speech sounds processing has been quite
consistently established for tonal contrasts (Marie, Delogu,
Lampis, Belardinelli & Besson, 2011; Slevc & Miyake,
2006; Wong, Skoe, Russo, Dees & Kraus, 2007), but the
findings are less clear for phonological contrasts (Delogu,
Lampis & Belardinelli, 2006, 2010).
A primary aim of this study was therefore to examine the
specific contributions of temporal, pitch, and spectral acuity
to the processing of different non-native speech sounds, and
to determine whether general measures of musical aptitude
can explain additional variance in non-native speech sound
processing above what is explained by these basic sensory
processes. To this end, we examined both a tonal and a
vowel contrast that exist in Norwegian, a language
unfamiliar to our participants. Many dialects of Norwegian
have lexical tone such that rising and falling-rising pitch
accents distinguish minimal pairs of segmentally identical
bi-syllabic words. For example, ‘Hammer’, spoken with the
rising tone, is a Norwegian proper noun while ‘hammer’,
spoken with the falling-rising tone, denotes the tool. These
contrasts encompass temporal changes in fundamental
frequency in the range of several hundreds of milliseconds.
Norwegian also contains a vowel contrast not present in
English, the /i/ - /y/ contrast. The existence of these
Norwegian contrasts offers the possibility to use linguistic

Are observed links between musicality and non-native speech
sound processing due to superior sensory processing of
temporal, pitch, and spectral information, which benefits both
musical and linguistic processing? Native English speakers
discriminated Norwegian tonal contrasts, non-linguistic puretone analogues, Norwegian vowels, and short tones differing
in temporal, pitch and spectral characteristics. Musicality was
measured using Gordon’s (1989) Advanced Measures of
Musical Audiation (AMMA). After controlling for effects of
sex, non-verbal IQ and previous language learning
experience, the link between AMMA scores and tonal contour
discrimination was partially mediated by pitch acuity. In
addition, tonal contrast, pitch contour and vowel
discrimination were predicted by temporal and spectral
acuity. No independent effects of musical training were
found. Thus, links between musicality and non-native speech
sound processing appear to be mainly due to superior
temporal, pitch or spectral acuity, which, in turn, may play
somewhat different roles in processing different speech
sounds.

Introduction
A number of studies have documented links between
musicality and the ability to discriminate non-native speech
sounds (Delogu, Lampis, Belardinelli, 2006, 2010; Marie,
Delogu, Lampis, Belardinelli & Besson, 2011; Slevc &
Miyake 2006; Wong, Skoe, Russo, Dees & Kraus, 2007).
These studies typically use complex psychometric measures
of musical aptitude, which leaves open the question as to
which specific sub-components of musical aptitude are
associated with non-native speech sound processing. Tests
like the Wing test (Wing, 1968) or Gordon’s Advanced
Measures of Musical Audiation (AMMA) (Gordon, 1989)
rely on working memory for musical and rhythmic phrases
as well as on the ability to discriminate subtle differences in
pitch, timbre, intensity, and rhythm. It is not clear which of
these sub-components of musical aptitude are linked to non-

752

stimuli rather than isolated synthesized segments, which
may be processed in ways that differ from processing of
natural linguistic materials. Moreover, to control for
differences between linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli, we
also used the extracted pure-tone analogues of the
Norwegian tonal contrasts as stimuli.
Musicality is a complex construct encompassing musical
aptitude as well as musical expertise (Nardo & Reiterer,
2009). Studies comparing non-native speech sound
processing between musicians and non-musicians (Marie et
al., 2011; Wong et al., 2007) suggest that musical practice
hones abilities such as sensory acuity, working memory, or
attentional control, which may transfer to the linguistic
domain. However, it is also possible that certain sensory or
cognitive abilities benefit both musical and linguistic
processing. To see whether musical expertise incurs benefits
for non-native speech sound processing in addition to
benefits associated with superior auditory sensory acuity,
we also examined whether the duration of musical training
would explain variance in non-native speech sound
processing over and above measures of musical aptitude.

within-category instantiations obtained from repeated
recordings of the same word.
Temporal Acuity. We synthesized eight 250 Hz sinusoidal
carrier waves with an overall duration of 600 ms differing in
amplitude envelope onset rise times, and otherwise devoid
of segmental, spectral and pitch information. The onset of
the amplitude envelope was faded in with rise times to reach
maximum amplitude at 0 ms, 10 ms, 20 ms, 30 ms, 60 ms,
70 ms, 80 ms and 90 ms. ‘Different’ trials comprised pairs
of sounds differing in rise times by 60 ms (e.g. 0 ms vs. 60
ms or 10 ms vs. 70 ms etc.), centered around 45 ms, a value
which has been reported as the category boundary between
‘bowed’ and ‘plucked’ sounds (Cutting & Rosner, 1974).
Pitch Acuity. We created eight 500 ms pure tone
sinusoidal carrier waves ranging from 100 to 3000 Hz in
steps increasing by 100 Hz resulting in tones of 100 Hz, 200
Hz, 400 Hz, 700 Hz, 1100 Hz, 1600 Hz, 2200 Hz, and 3000
Hz, as well as contrasts with a frequency increased by 2%
resulting in tones of 102 Hz, 204 Hz, 408 Hz, 714 Hz, 1122
Hz, 2244 Hz, and 3060 Hz. The cumulative increase was
designed to create sound pairs that subjectively sampled the
pitch range at roughly similar intervals, taking into account
the non-linearity of pitch perception. For the ‘different’
trials, each sound was paired with its corresponding contrast
sound resulting in pairs of 100 Hz vs. 102 Hz, 200 Hz vs.
204 Hz, 400 Hz vs. 408 Hz etc.)
Spectral Acuity. To test spectral acuity, we incorporated
the pure tones created for the pitch acuity test into complex
tones comprising low (e.g. 100 Hz or 200 Hz), middle (e.g.
700 Hz or 1100 Hz) and high (e.g. 2200 Hz or 3000 Hz)
frequencies. These frequencies were chosen to broadly
mimic the fundamental frequency and the first two formants
of speech, which are crucial for vowel perception. For
‘different’ pairs, one of the component tones was increased
by 2%, and this change affected either the middle or the
high frequency. For example, a ‘different’ pair might
include a complex tone consisting of frequencies of 100 Hz,
1100 Hz and 3000 Hz and a complex tone consisting of
frequencies of 100 Hz, 1122 Hz and 3000 Hz.
Norwegian tonal contrast. Recordings by a male native
speaker of Norwegian of eight minimal pairs of Norwegian
words containing a contrast between rising and falling-rising
tonal contours were taken from Kempe, Thoresen, Kirk,
Schaeffler & Brooks (2012). Four pairs contained short
vowels in the first (stressed) syllable (mean length 64 ms);
the remaining four pairs contained long vowels (mean
length 187 ms). Crucially, words with rising and with
falling-rising tones did not differ in length of the first vowel
(118 vs. 133 ms, p = .5), overall word length (396 vs. 417
ms, p = .2), and metric stress; thus, duration and stress could
not be used as additional cues. Corresponding short and
long vowel pairs were matched for their initial phoneme.
To ensure that a male advantage in the discrimination
these tonal contrasts, as found in previous research (Kempe
et al., 2012), was not an artifact of the male voice presenting
the stimuli, we also created a female voice version of the
stimuli. To control for indexical features, we submitted the

Method
Native speakers of English completed AX discrimination
tasks for non-native tonal and vowel contrasts, as well as for
synthesized sounds differing in temporal, pitch, and spectral
characteristics. Musical aptitude was tested using Gordon’s
AMMA (Gordon, 1989). To control for non-verbal
intelligence we administered Cattell’s Culture Fair
Intelligence Test (Cattell & Cattell, 1973). Music and
language background questionnaires inquired about length
of musical training and number of languages learned at
home or at school, and elicited self-ratings of proficiency in
each language (L2 and L3).

Participants
One hundred and three native speakers of American English
(58 women, 45 men) aged 19-22 years participated in the
study. Three participants failed to provide L3 proficiency
self-ratings, and one participant failed to provide pitch
discrimination data. These participants are missing from
analyses including these variables.

Materials and Tasks
Advanced Measures of Musical Audiation (AMMA):
Gordon’s (1989) AMMA consists of 30 items, each of
which comprises a short musical ‘statement’ followed after
four seconds by a short ‘answer’ of the same length. These
items contain either one or more tonal changes, or one or
more rhythmic changes, but not both. Participants have to
decide whether the phrases are the same or different. For
‘different’ items, participants are asked to decide whether
the difference is a tonal or rhythm change. The test yields a
tonal and rhythm score, as well as a composite score.
AX (‘same-different’) – tasks: All AX tasks comprised
32 ‘same’ and 32 ‘different’ trials. For the Norwegian tonal
and vowel contrasts, ‘same’ trials comprised different

male voice stimuli to the voice gender change algorithm in
PRAAT (Boersma & Weenink, 2011) using a fundamental
frequency of 220 Hz and scaling the first formant up by 20
%. All results below are averaged over the male-voiced and
the female-voiced version of the AX-task.
Pitch contour (non-speech analogue of tonal contrast).
The non-speech equivalents of the Norwegian tonal contrast
comprised sine waves with pitch contours extracted from
the fundamental frequency modulation of both the malevoiced and the female-voice Norwegian tonal contrasts.
These stimuli contained no information other than the pitch
contour of the Norwegian tones. Again, results below are
averaged over the male-voiced and the female-voiced
version of the AX-task.
Norwegian vowel contrast. We used eight minimal pairs
of Norwegian mono-syllabic words containing the vowel /i:/
or /I/ vs. /y:/ or /Y/, a contrast between high front unrounded
and rounded vowels which does not exist in English.
Recordings of a male native speaker of Norwegian were
taken from Kempe et al. (2012). Four word pairs contained
the short vowels /I/ and /Y/ (mean length 67 ms), and the
remaining four word pairs contained the long vowels /i:/ and
/y:/ (mean length 150 ms). On average both members of a
minimal pair did not differ in vowel length (108 vs. 108 ms,
p = .9); thus, duration could not serve as additional cue.
Other measures: Participants also completed Cattell’s
Culture-Fair Test of Nonverbal Intelligence, Scale 3, Form
A (Cattell & Cattell, 1973), a music background
questionnaire on which they provided information about
duration of musical training, and a language background
questionnaire on which they indicated the number of
languages learned, and rated their reading, writing, speaking
and comprehension abilities in all languages on a scale from
1 (very poor) to 6 (native-like).

Participants’ performance on the AX-tasks was
converted into A’, a sensitivity measure that corrects for
differences in response bias, and ranges from 0 to 1, with
0.5 corresponding to chance. Table 1 shows performance
with tonal contrasts, non-speech contour analogues, and
vowels. As previous research had shown a male advantage
for the processing of some non-native speech sounds
(Kempe et al., 2012; Bowles, Silbert, Jackson & Doughy,
2011), results are given for male and female participants
separately. A 3 (Condition) x 2 (Sex) ANOVA yielded a
main effect of Condition, F(2,202) = 8.2, p < .001.
Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests indicated that
performance was superior for the vowels compared to both
tonal conditions, all t’s > 3.4, all p’s < .01, which did not
differ from each other, p = .7. The main effect of Sex,
F(1,101) = 2.3, p = .1, and the interaction, F(2,202) = 2.8, p
= .06, fell short of significance. This trend towards a male
advantage in processing tonal contours, but not vowels
confirms the previous findings (Kempe et al., 2012).

Zero-order correlations between the predictors of nonnative speech-sound processing are provided in Table 2.
Noteworthy findings involve a positive correlation between
non-verbal intelligence and both AMMA scores, indicating
that comparison of musical phrases relies to some extent on
mechanisms shared with psychometric intelligence, such as
working memory and cognitive control (Duncan, Emslie,
Williams, Johnson & Freer, 1996). Also, as expected, pitch
and spectral acuity were positively correlated with both
AMMA scores. In contrast, temporal acuity was not
correlated with the AMMA scores, which may reflect the
fact that the temporal processing relevant for music involves
a longer time scale than the rapid temporal changes in the
order of tens of milliseconds presented in our temporal
acuity test. Instead, temporal acuity was positively
correlated with non-verbal intelligence, confirming the
documented link between rapid temporal auditory
processing and psychometric intelligence (Rammsayer &
Brandler, 2007).
The results of multiple regression analyses of non-verbal
intelligence, language background, sex (dummy-coded) and
the musicality measures on performance with tonal
contrasts, pitch contours and vowels are presented in Table
3 (upper panel). We found that non-verbal intelligence
showed a trend towards a positive association with
discrimination of tonal contours and non-linguistic pitch
contours. As indicated above, there was also a statistically
marginal male advantage for these stimuli. Crucially, the

Procedure
AX discrimination tasks were presented in three blocks,
with the first block containing the temporal, pitch and
spectral AX tasks, the second block containing the malevoiced and female-voiced tonal AX tasks as well as the
vowel AX task, and the third block containing the two AX
tasks presenting the extracted pitch contours of the malevoiced and female-voiced Norwegian tonal stimuli. The
fixed block sequence ensured that variance due to order
effects was not confounded with participant variance,
although task order was counterbalanced within blocks.
AMMA and Culture Fair Intelligence Test were interspersed
between blocks with their order counterbalanced as well.
Informed consent was obtained and background
questionnaires were completed prior to any of the tasks.
In each of the AX-tasks, participants received eight
practice trials with feedback, followed by 64 test trials
without feedback. Within a trial, sound stimuli were
separated by an inter-stimulus interval of 200 ms; the intertrial interval was 500 ms. Participants were asked to press
the ‘s’ key if they perceived the sounds to be the same and
the ‘d’ key if they perceived them to be different.

AMMA rhythm score predicted performance with tonal
contrasts, even if they were extracted and presented without
linguistic information. For non-native vowels, only selfrated proficiency in L3 predicted performance. Thus, while
tonal performance was related to musicality, vowel
performance was not, confirming observations by Delogu et
al. (2006; 2010). Note that there was no effect of musical
training.
Next, we added temporal, pitch and spectral acuity to the
model (lower panel of Table 3) to see whether auditory
acuity explains the link between musicality and non-native
tonal processing. All Variance Inflation Factors were below
3.8, suggesting that multi-collinearity was not a problem in
this data set. For the tonal contrast, we found a significant
effect of pitch acuity; the effects of temporal and spectral
acuity fell short of significance. For the extracted pitch
contour, we found a significant effect of spectral acuity; the
effect of temporal acuity fell short of significance. For the
vowel contrast, we found significant effects of temporal and
spectral acuity. In other words, the data showed a tendency
for temporal and spectral acuity to predict discrimination of
all non-native speech contrasts while the predictive effect of
pitch acuity was confined to the tonal contrasts.

intervals do not include zero. This analysis revealed that the
effect of the AMMA rhythm score on the tonal contrast was
partially mediated by pitch acuity (the obtained lower and
upper boundaries of the confidence interval were .0001 and
.0048, respectively). For the extracted pitch contour, there
were no indirect effects.

Discussion

To test explicitly whether the association of the AMMA
rhythm score with the tonal and the extracted pitch contour
contrasts was mediated by auditory acuity, we performed
mediation analyses employing bootstrapping to estimate the
95% confidence intervals of the indirect effect using a
procedure introduced by Hayes and Preacher (2013) for
multiple predictor variables (SPSS-macro MEDIATE,
http://www.afhayes.com/spss-sas-and-mplus-macros-andcode.html). A relative indirect effect is deemed to be
statistically significant at p = .05 if these confidence

When different measures of auditory sensory acuity
relevant to non-native speech-sound processing were added
into a multiple regression model, they had an independent
effect beyond effects of musical aptitude. For Norwegian
tonal contrasts, the effect of musical aptitude was partially
mediated by pitch acuity. For non-linguistic pitch contours
and for vowels, performance was mainly predicted by
temporal and spectral acuity rather than musical aptitude.
This suggests that associations between musical aptitude
and non-native speech-sound processing predominantly

755

arise from superior sensory processing encompassing the
ability to make subtle distinctions in temporal, pitch, and
spectral properties of the sounds. This finding is
incompatible with claims that musical and linguistic
processing exploits different cues—with language mainly
relying on rapid temporal processing and music relying on
processing of pitch and spectral information (Zatorre, Belin
& Penhune, 2002). By showing that musical aptitude
contributes little to non-native speech sound processing
beyond effects of temporal, pitch and spectral acuity, our
findings underscore the importance of these basic sensory
processes for both music and speech sound processing, and
thereby support the idea of partially shared mechanisms
(Patel, 2003; Strait, Hornickel & Kraus, 2011). This is not to
say that musical aptitude does not encompass other
components that may or may not be shared with language;
rather, we suggest that the links between musical aptitude
tests and non-native speech sound processing reported in the
literature may be due to basic temporal, pitch and spectral
acuity to a significant degree.
Before sensory acuity measures were added to the
regression model, effects of musical ability were found only
for tonal contrasts and their non-linguistic analogues, but
not for the phonemic vowel contrast. This confirms reports
that the link between musicality and non-native speech
sound processing is strongest for tonal contrasts (Delogu et
al., 2006, 2010). Adding temporal, pitch and spectral acuity
to the model qualified this picture: We had hypothesized
that discrimination of tonal contrasts would be predicted by
temporal as well as pitch and spectral acuity, whereas
discrimination of vowel contrasts would be predicted
mainly by spectral acuity. Indeed, for tonal contrasts and
pitch contours this prediction bore out, although some
effects fell short of significance. This confirms the
previously observed role of temporal information, in
addition to pitch and spectral information, in the processing
of pitch contours, whether embedded in linguistic material
or presented on their own (Kempe et al., 2012)—an
important finding as researchers often conceive of lexical
tones as predominantly involving pitch processing, even
though lexical tones often entail changes of pitch and
spectral information over time.
Counter to our prediction, we found that, along with
spectral acuity, temporal acuity was also a significant
predictor for vowel processing. This is surprising because
we had carefully controlled for vowel length and metrical
stress to exclude temporal information as an additional cue.
Still, it is possible that participants were sensitive to subtle
durational differences in other segments when trying to
discriminate between the Norwegian words. Interestingly,
performance with the vowel contrast was also significantly
predicted by self-rating in an L3, which suggests that some
of the languages participants studied later in life might have
provided prior exposure to the /i/ - /y/ vowel contrast, and
this experience may have transferred to our stimuli. The
effects of prior language experience notwithstanding, our
findings suggest that both temporal and spectral acuity were

important predictors for the particular phonological contrast
used in this study; the lack of a significant correlation of
either AMMA scores with temporal acuity might explain
why musical aptitude did not predict performance for this
particular contrast.
More generally, our findings suggest that temporal,
spectral and, to some extent, pitch acuity, underlie
processing of a variety of non-native speech sounds. This
adds an important facet to our understanding of speechsound processing in light of approaches that focus on rapid
temporal auditory processing as the main sensory
component underlying language (Goswami et al., 2002;
Tallal, 1980). Moreover, subtle differences in the role of
spectral, pitch, and temporal acuity in the processing of
different phonemes might account for why links between
musicality and non-native phoneme processing sometimes
remain elusive (Delogu et al., 2006, 2010). For the tonal
contrasts, on the other hand, the residual effects of musical
aptitude may reflect shared working memory components
(Williamson, Baddeley & Hitch, 2010), in addition to
sensory components, due to the somewhat longer duration
of these stimuli. In addition, the finding that sensory acuity
played a similar role in the processing of tonal contrasts and
their non-linguistic analogues challenges the view that
linguistic stimuli enjoy a special status with respect to basic
sensory processing (Gandour et al., 2000)—a conclusion
that needs to be verified through neuro-imaging studies.
The finding that the AMMA rhythm score was a better
predictor of non-native tonal and pitch contour processing
than the tonal score confirms similar findings with respect
to non-native speech sound processing (Nardo & Reiterer,
2009), as well as auditory working memory and reading
performance in children (Strait et al., 2011). It appears that
information related to repetitiveness, predictability and the
sequential nature of sound sequences as measured by the
rhythm score has greater diagnostic validity for detecting
subtle changes in linguistic stimuli than information related
to pitch differences.
A number of studies have conceptualized musicality as
musical expertise and suggested that exposure to, and
regular practice of music may hone sensory and cognitive
abilities, which can subsequently benefit language
processing (Marie et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2007). If this
were correct one would expect experience with music,
measured as number of years of musical training, to exert an
independent effect on non-native speech sound processing.
Musical training in our sample ranged from 0 to 20 years.
Still, no independent effects of length of musical training on
non-native speech-sound processing were found. Thus, our
findings do not support the notion that musical expertise has
independent effects over and above musical aptitude; rather,
they suggest that auditory sensory acuity benefits
performance both in the musical and the linguistic domain.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that our findings partially
replicated the sex difference in non-native speech sound
processing observed in previous studies (Bowles et al.,
2011; Kempe et al., 2012). This sex difference was assumed

756

to be due to a general male advantage in rapid temporal
auditory processing (Wittman & Szelag, 2003) and temporal
discrimination tasks (Rammsayer & Troche, 2010), and,
thus, should be found for processing of speech sounds that
require rapid temporal auditory processing. Indeed, the
difference in sensitivity for tonal contrasts and extracted
pitch contours pointed towards a male advantage, although
the effect fell short of statistical significance in the multiple
regression analyses. In further support, a separate analysis
for just the tonal and pitch contour stimuli yielded a main
effect of sex, F(1, 101) = 4.7, p < .05. Surprisingly,
however, the predicted male advantage was not observed for
temporal acuity, p = .9; instead, we found a male advantage
in pitch acuity, t(101) = 2.06, p < .05. This suggests that
while a male advantage in processing of non-native tonal
contrasts seems to be a robust phenomenon, future research
may have to explore alternative explanations with respect to
the underlying mechanisms.
In sum, our findings further illuminate the link between
musical aptitude and non-native speech-sound processing by
demonstrating that this link is largely explained by sensory
acuity. Our results also suggest that temporal, pitch, and
