Abstract
A constructivist neural network is presented that models
impaired in ectional processing in German agrammatic
aphasia. The model is based on a single mechanism and
develops two types of representation through a constructivist learning process. The model accounts for data
that has been taken as evidence for a dual mechanism
theory of in ection, and it suggests an in ectional processing system that is based not on a distinction between
regular and irregular cases, but between in ections that
are easy and hard to learn. The model represents a succesful single-mechanism neural network account of verb
in ections.

Introduction

The debate between rule-based and association-based
theories of in ection has been continuing for many years
and has moved from the initial focus on the English past
tense to other languages such as the German participle
(e.g. Clahsen, 1999; Marcus et al., 1995). The reason
for this shift is that in English, the issues of \regularity" and \high frequency" are confounded which makes
it di√Ücult to distinguish between the di erent theories.
By contrast, in the German participle the regular case
does not apply to the majority of all verbs, making it a
so-called \minority default" (Marcus et al., 1995).
A popular recent theory of how in ections are formed
is the Dual Mechanism Theory (DMT) that postulates
two qualitatively distinct mechanisms for the production
of regular and irregular cases (e.g. Clahsen, 1999; Pinker,
1991, 1997; Marcus et al., 1995). According to the DMT,
regular in ections are produced by a mental symbolic
rule, whereas irregulars are stored in an associative lexicon. Based on these mechanisms, the DMT claims to
account for di erences in the processing of regular and
irregular in ections: whereas regular forms are applied
productively to novel forms independently of their similarity to existing forms (e.g., faxed ), irregular in ections
show similarity e ects both in existing \families" (read
read, lead
led, breed
bred ) and in the extension
to novel forms (cleed
cled ).
However, while considerable empirical research has established processing di erences between regular and irregular forms on many di erent levels from acquisition
over psycholinguistic and ERP studies to impaired adult
processing (see Clahsen, 1999, for an overview), little
progress has been made in the speci cation of the DMT.
Particularly problematic is the question in which way the

two mechanisms interact to produce the in ected form.
Marcus et al. (1995) proposed the Blocking Principle
which states that a lexical entry (indicating an irregular
verb) blocks the application of the rule, but an implementation of this principle (Nakisa et al., 1997) showed
that in practice it involves parameters for which a useful
setting cannot be found. Therefore, the DMT remains
highly underspeci ed and thus hard to falsify. However,
even in its underspeci ed form, the DMT is contradicted
by some empirical data, e.g., frequency e ects for regular
English past tense (Stemberger and MacWhinney, 1986)
and regular Dutch plural (Baayen et al., 1997) forms,
and similarity e ects for regular German participles in
agrammatic aphasia (Penke et al., 1999).
In this paper I present a neural network model of
in ectional processing in German agrammatic aphasia
that accounts for dissociations between regular and irregular forms without postulating two qualitatively distinct
mechanisms. Instead, the model develops two types of
representations in a constructivist process, driven by the
structure of the training data, and it displays emerging
areas of functional specialization that correspond largely,
but not completely, to the distinction between regular
and irregular forms. The trained model is lesioned in
di erent ways and it accounts for empirical data better
than the DMT. Based on these results I propose a new
theory of in ectional processing that is based on a distinction not between regular and irregular, but between
\easy to learn" and \hard to learn" forms.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: rst, the
structure of the German participle and the impairment
pro les observed in agrammatic aphaisa are reviewed.
Then, the network model, the data, and the training
regime are described, followed by a detailed analysis of
the performance of the model in comparison with agrammatic aphasics. Finally, the resulting new theory of
in ectional processing is presented and related to the
DMT.

The German Participle
German participles are comparable in usage to the English past tense in describing an event in the past. There
are three groups of participles: Weak participles are
formed by a (prosodically determined) pre x ge-, the
verb stem, and the ending -t, e.g., sagen (say) gesagt
(said). Strong participles take the ending -en, e.g., geben
(give) gegeben (given) and they may also change the

!

!

!

verb stem, e.g., gehen (go)
gegangen (gone). A few
strong verbs have idiosyncratic participle forms, e.g.,
sein (be) gewesen (been). The third group are mixed
verbs that take the weak ending -t but change their
stems like strong verbs, e.g., wissen (know)
gewusst
(known). It is generally claimed that the weak verbs
form the regular class, while strong verbs are irregular,
and the terms regular and irregular will here be used in
this sense.
In contrast to English, German does not have a majority of regular tokens (each verb counted according to
how often it occurs in a corpus), and the majority of
types (each verb counted just once) is less pronounced
than in English.
The CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1993) lists 3015
German participles. After cleaning out some obvious errors and homophones and choosing the more frequent of
di erent participle forms of one stem, 2992 participles
remain. However, German verbs are often formed by
modifying other existing verbs with a pre x or separable particle, e.g., the simplex verb fahren (drive) occurs
in CELEX in 28 composite forms such as hinausfahren,
losfahren, fortfahren etc. (drive out, drive o , continue).
Since a pre x or particle do not alter the way in which
the participle of a simplex verb is formed, all composite
forms were combined into one simplex form.
For the simulation experiments described below,
20,000 verb tokens were randomly extracted from this
corpus according to their frequency. To ensure that each
verb occurred at least once, all verb types which had not
been randomly selected were added onto the resulting
corpus with a token frequency of one (this applied to 18
verbs).
The structure of the resulting training corpus is shown
in table 1.

Agrammatic Aphasia

Agrammatic (Broca's) aphasia is a language disorder
that is generally caused by a stroke predominantly a ecting anterior parts of the left hemisphere. One of the characteristic symptoms of Broca's aphasia is the tendency
to omit or confuse in ections. Investigating the precise
nature of these de cits can therefore lead to insights into
the internal representation of in ectional morphology.
Penke et al. (1999) analyzed data from eleven aphasic
subjects who each produced 39 regular and 39 irregular
participles in a sentence completion task with respect
to regular and irregular errors, overregularizations and
irregularizations, frequency e ects, and e ects of ablautpatterns on error rates. They found irregular in ections
to be selectively imapaired in six of the subjects, and
three showed no signi cant di erence between regular

and irregular participles (the remaining two made more
irregular errors but their total number of errors was too
small to establish a signi cant di erence between regulars and irregulars). Penke et al. (1999) concluded that
irregular in ection can be selectively imapired in agrammatic aphasia.

The Network Model
For the simulations described in this paper, a constructivist neural network (CNN) model was developed that
builds the hidden layer of a radial basis function (RBF)
network. Each hidden unit has a Gaussian activation
function and thus acts as a receptive eld for an area
of the input space. The problem in building RBF networks is to decide on the number and positions of these
receptive elds. The CNN algorithm solves this problem
by constructing the hidden layer during learning, adding
units when and where they are needed. The network
starts with just two units in the hidden layer, each covering roughly half of the input space (see gure 1). The
network tries to learn the task with this architecture
(by adjusting the weights with quickprop), and when
learning no longer improves the performance, a new unit
is inserted. The place where the new unit is inserted
is determined by the classi cation error resulting from
treating inputs within one receptive eld as similar: the
receptive eld that previously caused the highest error is
shrunk and the new unit is inserted next to it. The idea
here is that a unit which produces a high output error is
inadequate, and therefore more structural resources are
needed in that area. A similar network has already been
successfully used to model the acquisition of the English
past tense (Westermann, 1998).

the beginning (left) and the end (right) of learning.
Figure 1 shows a hypothetical start and end state in
a two-dimensional input space. While initially only two
units cover the whole of the space, later hidden units
have been inserted with di erent densities across the
space to account for the speci c learning task.
Figure 2 shows the network architecture. The input
layer takes a phonological representation of the verb innitive, and the output layer has one unit for each possible output class (see below). The hidden layer initially
consists of only two units but is grown during learning.
There are direct connections from the input to the output layer, and each hidden unit is fully connected to the
output layer.

Localized Lesioning

The output in the CNN model is produced through two
sets of connections: the direct connections between the
input and the output layer that the network started out
with, and the connections from the growing hidden to
the output layer. A localized lesioning of these pathways in the CNN resulted in a double dissociation between regular and irregular verbs for four out of the ve
runs. The further analyses were conducted with these
four networks.

Data

Training
The task to be learned by the network was the mapping
from the phonological representation of the verb in nitive to the class of its participle. Viewing the learning
of the participle as a classi cation task avoids confounding it with phonological details such as di erent pronunciation of regular forms depending on the last stem
phoneme (e.g., holen
geholt vs. landen
gelandet ).
Five CNN models were trained on this corpus with
di erent random initial weight settings. The networks
were tested before the insertion of a new hidden unit.
An output class was counted as correct when the corresponding unit, but no other unit, had an activation value
over 0.7.

!

Results
In order to model agrammatic aphasia, the CNN was lesioned in di erent ways. It was assumed that the removal
of weights in the model corresponds to the destruction
of neural tissue in the brain by a stroke.

The 664 German verbs were classi ed according to the
way in which their participles are formed, resulting in a
total of 22 classes, one of which was the \stem+-t " (regular) class, 6 were for mixed verbs, and 15 for irregular
verbs.
The verbs were represented phonologically, and each
phoneme was encoded by a 7-bit feature vector with features such as fricative, plosive, voiced etc. for consonants,
and front, high, open etc. for vowels. Presence of a feature was encoded with 1 and absence with -1.
For the training of the network, the phonological
representation of the in nitive of each verb was then
inserted into a template consisting of three syllables:
XCCCVVCC-XCCCVVCC-XCCCVVCC; C stands for
consonant, V for vowel, and X for whether the syllable is stressed or not. Since the endings of verbs are
signi cant for the determination of the participle class,
the verbs were right-aligned in this template so that the
endings occurred in the same slots.
The resulting network had 150 input units (three syllables with seven phonemes each represented by seven
features, plus one stress-bit per syllable), and 22 output
units for the 22 in ection classes.

Figure 3: Double dissociation between regular and irregular (and mixed) verbs after lesioning the two pathways
in the networks.
Figure 3 shows the results of lesioning the hiddenoutput (HO) and the direct input-output (IO) connections. Lesioning the HO connections resulted in a
marked decrease of the performance of irregular and
mixed verbs, with regular in ections remaining nearly
fully intact. By contrast, lesioning the IO connections
resulted in the opposite pro le: performance of regulars
was signi cantly more impaired than that of irregular
and mixed verbs. It is important to note that this double dissociation emerged as a result of the structure of
the training data together with the constructivist development of the model and was in no way prespeci ed.
Removing the HO connections in the network thus
modeled the basic de cit in the in ection of agrammatic
aphasics, namely, the breakdown of irregular and selective sparing of regular participles. Based on this result,
the performance of the HO-lesioned CNN models was
investigated with respect to the more detailed results reported by Penke et al. (1999).
Penke et al. (1999) found that all subjects who made
more errors on irregulars than on regulars overgeneralized the regular ending -t to irregular verbs, but they
only rarely irregularized regular verbs (i.e., their regular errors consisted mainly in using a wrong su√Üx or
none at all). Testing the four corresponding CNN models for this behavior showed a good match of the aphasic
pro les: the networks over-applied the regular class to
73.7% of all wrong irregulars (aphasics: 63.3%), but only
6.5% of all regular errors were irregularizations (aphasics: 14.3%). The other errors that can be made by the
CNN models are no output, or ambiguous output when
two (or more) output units are simultaneously activated.

Global Lesioning

As shown in the previous section, the lesioning of the HO
pathway in the CNN model can account for a selective
impairment in the in ection of irregular verbs and thus
model the performance of agrammatic aphasic subjects.
This selective and total lesioning of one pathway might
suggest that the processing of regular and irregular verbs
is subserved by locally di erent brain structures that can
be selectively a ected by a stroke. To establish whether
the observed pro le could be modeled without this assumption, the e ects of globally lesioning the network to
di erent degrees was investigated, without making a distinction between the IO and the HO connections. Over
200 trials, the network was lesioned in 5%-steps by randomly removing weights from both sets of connections.

% irregulars correct

Based on the assumption of two qualitatively distinct
processing mechanisms for regular and irregular in ections, Penke et al. (1999) predicted and found a frequency e ect in the aphasic production of irregulars, but
not of regulars: there were signi cantly more errors for
infrequent irregulars than for frequent ones, but no such
e ect occurred for regulars. When tested on the same
verbs as the aphasic subjects, the CNN models equally
showed a small frequency e ect for irregulars but not
for regulars: the error rate for low frequency irregulars
(93.3%) was signi cantly higher than for high frequency
irregulars (89.0%) (Wilcoxon, p = 0:068), but error rates
for regulars did not di er statistically (1.7% for low frequency and 2.4% for high frequency regulars, p = 0:273).
Alternatively to a qualitative distinction, regulars and
irregulars might represent two ends of a continuum: a
regular verb can be said to be \very regular" if it is
similar to other regulars and dissimilar to irregulars. It
is \less regular" if it is dissimilar to other regulars but
similar to irregulars. The reverse is true for irregulars
(see also Daugherty and Seidenberg, 1992).
This assumption is attractive because it integrates
mixed verbs which fall between regulars and irregulars
in that they combine an irregular stem with the regular
ending. Mixed verbs are generally ignored in the DMT
because they are hard to consolidate with the proposed
qualitative distinction between regulars and irregulars.
A regularity continuum would predicted that \less regular" regulars, being more similar to irregulars, should
be more error prone than \very regular" regulars in
agrammatic aphasics. Penke et al. (1999) analyzed the
distribution of verbs with respect to stem vowels and
found that for the stem vowel <e>, irregulars outnumber regulars, making regulars with this stem vowel less
regular. Therefore, regular verbs with <e> should have
a higher error rate because they are similar to irregulars.
This prediction was con rmed in the analysis of the
aphasic data: all regular su√Üxation errors occurred with
<e>-stems. While Penke et al. (1999) interpreted their
results within the framework of a qualitative distinction
between regulars and irregulars (allowing grading e ects
for both mechanisms with the qualitatively distinct verb
groups in uencing each other), a more plausible interpretation is that of a regularity continuum where a single
mechanism underlies the production of both forms.
Testing the CNN model, which is based on such a
single mechanism, for this e ect yielded the same pattern
of results as in the aphasic subjects: when tested on the
same verbs, 4 out of 5 of the regular errors were for the
stem vowel <e>, indicating that these verbs are treated
more like irregulars.
In summary, by lesioning the HO connections in the
CNN model, detailed aspects of the performance of
agrammatic aphasics on German participle in ections
could be modeled. These results comprise both those
that have been claimed to be evidence for the dual
mechanism theory (double dissociations; frequency effects only for irregulars) and those that contradict the
predictions of the dual mechanism theory (regularity
continuum e ect).

lesioning trials at 20 lesioning steps each (in 5%-steps).
Greyscale indicates degree of lesioning (from dark to
light). Data for the aphasic subjects are marked by circles.
The result of this global lesioning is shown in gure 4.
The 4,000 lesioned networks showed some variety of regular vs. irregular errors, but, like with the aphasic subjects, there was never a selective sparing of irregulars
with a breakdown on regular participles (top left of the
plot). Instead, in most cases impairment of irregulars
was stronger than of regulars (below the diagonal).
The data for the eleven aphasic subjects from (Penke
et al., 1999) are also displayed in gure 4. All aphasic
data are within the range of performance predicted by
the simulations, showing that although there is variability in the performance of agrammatic aphasics, di erently lesioned CNNs can model the performance of each
of them. The model is not over-general, however: like in
aphasic subjects, a selective sparing of irregulars with a
breakdown of regular in ections did not occur in any of
the lesioning trials.
Why does global lesioning in the CNN lead to a prole in which irregular participles are more impaired than

regulars? An answer to this question can be found by
analyzing the connections in the model. Many of the IO
connections are inhibitory, suppressing the activation of
the wrong in ection class by other IO connections. This
pro le is due to the distributed representation of the input: overlapping representations between classes make
the inhibition of wrongly activated classes necessary, and
with increased lesioning this inhibition is lost, resulting
in the activation of wrong output classes for regular and
irregular verbs equally. By contrast, the HO connections
from one receptive eld usually contain only one strongly
excitatory weight to the correct output class. Therefore,
the HO weights do not tend to activate a wrong output
class. This di erent weight structure can be explained by
the localist nature of the receptive elds: due to the constructivist growth process, receptive elds tend to cover
only verbs from one class. Therefore, representations for
di erent classes do not overlap and inhibition is not required. An analysis of the distribution of the receptive
elds over the verbs showed that they had been preferentially allocated for the di√Ücult-to-learn irregular verbs.
Therefore, a partial lesioning of the HO connections affected predominantly irregulars. Taken together, irregulars were impaired by the removal of weights in both the
IO and the HO connections, while regulars were a ected
only by lesioned IO connections. Together, a global lesioning therefore led to a more pronounced breakdown
for irregulars than for regulars.
A global lesioning pro le in which regular in ections
are selectively impaired could only arise from a total lesioning of the IO connections together with no or weak
lesioning of the HO connections. Based on the CNN
model therefore the prediction is made that a selective
impairment of regular in ections in aphasics would be
evidence for a locally separate processing of regular and
irregular in ections in the brain, whereas the selective
impairment of irregulars cannot be taken as evidence for
such a separation.

A Dual-Representation Theory of Verb
In ection

The results described in this paper show that the CNN
can account for detailed empirical results from agrammatic aphasic in ectional processing. At the same time,
the CNN avoids the problems of the DMT, namely,
underspeci cation and contradiction to some empirical
data.
Whereas the DMT proposes two mechanisms operating on a single representation of a verb stem, the CNN
develops so that a single mechanism operates on two
representations of the verb. Initially, the direct phonological input is used in the IO pathway to produce the
output class. For verbs for which the output cannot
be learned based on this structural representation alone,
the CNN develops through a constructivist process additional representations in the hidden layer. In contrast
to the structure-based input representations, these new
representations are identity-based and localist: the activation of a hidden unit receptive eld only indicates the
presence of a certain input, without information about

its structure. The CNN is therefore a single mechanism,
but dual representation model. This dual representation
view sheds a di erent light on the dissociations between
regular and irregular forms. The DMT does not assume
that any regular verbs are produced by the irregular
mechanism, or vice versa. The common aphasic prole where both regular and irregular cases are partially
impaired (albeit to di erent degrees) is therefore often
attributed to performance errors or the unpredictability
of aphasic impairment.
A more compelling explanation is o ered by the CNN:
here, the dissociations that become visible in the lesioning trials do not run clearly along the lines of regulars
vs. irregulars. Instead, all verbs for which the in ection
class cannot be learned in the direct IO pathway are
shifted to the developing hidden layer and the HO pathway. This shift concerns regular, irregular, and mixed
verbs, to di erent degrees. The dissociation between
verbs is thus better described as easy to learn vs. difcult to learn, with the di√Ücult forms relying on the
hidden layer, whereas easy forms are produced in the IO
pathway alone. This distinction can account better for
the data such as mixed verbs, a regularity continuum, or
the di erent aphasic pro les.
But what factors determine whether a form is easy or
di√Ücult to learn? The degree of di√Üculty is determined
by several interacting distributional factors that can be
derived from the principles of associative learning:
1. Frequency: a frequent transformation is easier to learn
than an infrequent one. Therefore, in ection classes
with a high summed token frequency will be easier to
learn than those that only apply to rare verbs.
2. Class size: a transformation that applies to many different verbs is easier to learn than one that just applies
to one verb. Therefore, in ection classes with many
members (counted in types) are easier to learn than
those con ned to only a small group of verbs.
3. Similarity of class members to members of other
classes: the in ection class of a verb is easier to learn
if other similar verbs share the same class.
4. Ambiguity of in ectional morpheme: an in ection is
easier to learn if it applies uniquely to members of
its class, i.e., if it does not exist in other context as
well. For example, the -ed su√Üx in English is highly
indicative of the past tense: an analysis of the CELEX
corpus showed that 99.6% of all word types in English
that end in -ed are past tense forms. By contrast, the
German irregular participle ending -en is much more
ambiguous: it also occurs in verb in nitives (gehen, to
go), noun plurals (Wiesen, meadows), and as part of
noun singulars (Drachen, kite).
These factors in uence each other, and further research will be needed to establish in detail how they
interact. Nevertheless they show that the regular |
irregular distinction is a good rst approximation of
the easy |di√Ücult distinction: the regular in ection, although it does not apply to the most frequent individual

verbs, is the single most frequent in ection in both English and German: 57.2% of English past tense tokens
and 46.89% of German participle tokens are regular. At
the same time, these classes are also the biggest in type
size (88.4% and 64.7%, respectively). However, the third
point, similarity of class members to members of other
classes, does not separate along the lines of regular and
irregular verbs: many regular verbs are similar to irregulars which should make them harder to learn in this
view. And in fact the regularity continuum that has
been shown for aphasics indicates that regulars that are
similar to irregulars are more prone to impairment than
others, that is, they rely more on storage in the lexicon.
A similar analysis of factors in uencing errors in past
tense formation has been conducted with school children
(Marchman, 1997), where their errors on an elicited past
tense production task were determined by frequency, the
number of similar sounding stems in the same and in
di erent in ection classes, and the phonological characteristics of the stem and past tense forms.
Taken together, although the dissociations of verbs
into easy and di√Ücult corresponds largely to the regularirregular dissociation, it nevertheless suggests that the
regular case is a post-hoc extraction and idealization of
the developed structure of the in ectional processing system.

Discussion
The results presented in this paper suggest a novel account of in ection learning and processing: it is a single
mechanism system in which dual representations emerge
from a constructivist learning process together with the
structure of the environment. The system separates
verbs along the lines of easy vs. hard to learn and can
thus better explain empirical results that have so far
been taken as evidence for the Dual Mechanism Theory.
The qualitative distinction between regular and irregular
in ections that lies at the core of the DMT, is a projection of formal linguistic analysis onto the human data.
Because according to formal linguistics, human language
data does not correspond to the abstract \competence"
but is instead corrupted as \performance", any data that
does not correspond to the predictions of the formal theory (i.e., regulars that behave like irregulars and vice
versa) can therefore be attributed to performance. This
method makes the DMT hard to falsify based on such
data. By contrast, the CNN model is fully speci ed,
and it shows how the actual human data can be modeled without recourse to a competence-performance distinction. Whereas the abstract category of \regularity"
remains a good formal description of language structure,
the fallacy is in drafting it into service as a processing
category, as done in the DMT.
A way to test the validity of the CNN model empirically is to abandon the regular/irregular distinction in
favour of an easy/hard distinction, by identifying \hard"
regulars and \easy" irregulars. Such a distinction should
then better predict impairment pro les in agrammatic
aphasics and other aspects of dissociations in in ectional
systems. More research along these lines will be needed

to empirically verify the dual-representation model of
verb in ection.
While connectionist, single-mechanism models of inections have been rejected by proponents of the DMT
(e.g. Clahsen, 1999; Pinker, 1997; Marcus et al., 1995),
the CNN model presents evidence that such models can
account for in ectional processing more successfully than
theories that rely on qualitatively distinct processing
mechanisms.
