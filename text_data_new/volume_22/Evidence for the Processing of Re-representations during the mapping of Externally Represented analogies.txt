Abstract
High level descriptions of the analogical reasoning
process in cognitive science have now converged t o
present a relatively unified account (Hummel and
Holyoak, 1997). However, the broad, consensual
account of analogy is still far from complete: whilst it i s
possible to give a good explanation of the mapping of
larger, structured representations in analogy, accounts of
the mappings of individual sub-elements in these
representations are still under-specified. Here, we review
some possible approaches to this problem, describe an
experiment that provides some empirical support for the
‘re-representation’ approach to sub-mapping, and then
identify some shortcomings in the ‘re-representation’
approach as it is currently conceived.

Introduction
Cognitive science has made great strides towards
answering the important question of ‘How do humans
reason by analogy?’ If we take a familiar example, the
analogy between the solar system and Rutherford’s model
of the atom, then it is possible to explain – in broad
terms – exactly how it is that two seemingly disparate
objects can both remind us of one another in the first
place, and then how it is that we can make meaningful
correspondences between them.
Studies have shown that reminding (or retrieval) is
driven by a computationally inexpensive process that
initially matches surface (or semantic) elements in
representations (witness the frequency – and mundanity –
of most similarity based remindings, such as a lamp-shade
reminding a party joker of a hat; see Gentner, Ratterman
and Forbus, 1993).
Analogical mappings, on the other hand, are determined
by a relatively more computationally expensive process.
Global, systematic structural similarities between items to
be matched need to be detected in order to make the kind of
‘deeper’, inference supporting correspondences that
characterise analogy (Gentner, 1983; Goswami, 1992;
Holyoak and Thagard, 1995; Hummel and Holyak, 1997).
Whilst theories and models of analogy are very
compelling at one level of abstraction, there are certain
assumptions made by all analogical theories that beg
interesting questions if one seeks a more detailed
explanation. As one increases the resolution of the
question ‘How do humans reason by analogy?’ it appears
that there are important gaps in current theories and

process models. Here, we wish to consider just one aspect
of one of these gaps: the problem we focus on is that of
matching the ‘semantics’ of elements during the
analogical mapping process. This problem can be
summarised as follows: suppose that in your
representation of the atom, you describe the motion of an
electron in relation to the nucleus in terms of it
“revolving around” the nucleus (perhaps this is how you
ordinarily think about this motion). On the other hand,
suppose that in your representation of the solar system
you conceive the motion of the planets in terms of their
“orbiting” the sun.
At one level of abstraction, it may be sufficient to say
that similarities in the meanings – or usage – of these
words determine these mappings. However, in a more
detailed account – and model – of analogy we might wish
to do more than appeal to humanistic intuitions about
similarities of meaning. We might wish to account for the
way in which these sub-elements of our representations of
the atom and the solar-system are mapped onto one
another with the same level of detail with which we
account for the mappings between the representations
themselves.
If we are to fully explain high-level mapping in
analogy, we must also account for the way lexically
distinct but ‘semantically’ similar items in representations
are reconciled with each other in a way that allows highlevel mappings to be made. Here, we review some
possible approaches to this problem, and present some
evidence that offers some support to a popular proposal in
the literature: the re-representation hypothesis.

Semantic reconciliation and the re-representation
hypothesis
Perhaps the most straightforward way to explain the
mapping between “revolving around” and “orbiting”1
would be in conceptual terms. If “revolving around” and
“orbiting” could be shown to decompose into some
canonical
conceptual
representation
(say
“circumnavigating”), then the link between them could be
explained by reference to that concept, and the process by
which it is made. This proposal is put forward by
Gentner, Ratterman and Forbus (1993):
“[the...] constraint of matching identical predicates assumes
canonical conceptual representations, not lexical strings. Two
concepts that are similar but not identical (such as “bestow” and
“bequeath”) are assumed to be decomposed into a canonical
1
We shall refer to this as the problem of semantic reconciliation in
analogy.

representation language so that their similarity is expressed as a
partial identity (... “give”)” Gentner, Ratterman and Forbus
(1993, p 553)

The main drawback to this proposal is the lack of any
specification of what a canonical conceptual representation
(or a canonical representation language) is. Research into
the mental representation of concepts suggests that human
conceptual representations are anything but canonical; the
proposals for generalised theories of representation that
exist in the concepts literature fall well short of providing
the kind of ‘neat’ account of concepts that canonical
conceptual representation assumes (see Komatsu, 1992;
Ramscar and Hahn, 1998 for reviews).
This problem has not gone unrecognised. In
conjunction with other factors, such as evidence of the
important role that structural commonalities (the ‘what’ of
analogy) play in ‘ordinary’ conceptual tasks (e.g. Ahn,
1998), and the sheer difficulty of distinguishing analogy
from ‘ordinary’ conceptual tasks (Ramscar and Pain,
1996), a widespread view has emerged that suggests that
analogy itself may play an important role in semantic
reconciliation (Forbus, Gentner, Markman and Ferguson,
1997, Hummel and Holayoak, 1997).
The basic idea behind this is outlined by Forbus,
Gentner, Markman and Ferguson (1997) who propose that
semantic terms might be decomposed into sub-predicate
re-representations, with mapping between these being
determined using the same process as similarity based
transfer:

revolves around supplying an account of what happens
when two ‘semantically similar’ terms – “revolving
around” and “orbiting” – are encountered during the
mapping process. In ordinary usage, the representations
of human category information involved in these
processes are implicit; people know what – “revolving
around “and “orbiting” mean, and they reconcile (or map
between) the two terms accordingly. But the exact nature
of what they know, and how such knowledge is
represented appears to be inaccessible at the level of detail
required to specify and model the underlying cognitive
processes involved in the semantic reconciliation of the
two terms.
Participants were asked to make inferences with the aid
of two candidate bases (see figure 1). In both the target
and each of the two candidate bases, the term that was
crucial to determining the representation of higher order
structure in the scenarios was a novel, artificial term. By
supplying ‘definitions’ for that term, we hoped to be able
to control the representations participants used for
semantically reconciling particular terms during their
analogising. By doing this, we hoped to test the
prediction that participants would use the same process to
match semantic items in their representations as they
would in ultimately determining their analogies - i.e. that
in these externally represented analogies, at least,
participants would use and process re-representations to
facilitate semantic reconciliation.

“re-representation allows relational identicality to arise out of...
analogical alignment, rather than as a strict constraint on the input
descriptions” Forbus, Gentner,Markman and Ferguson (1997, p
246).

A similar re-representation proposal is advanced by
Hummel and Holyoak (1997):
“With the notion of chunked predicates and objects, LISA hints at
a kind of recursive representation for meaning that may
ultimately ground itself in basic perceptual primitives. In its
current implementation, LISA can represent and map
hierarchical propositions of arbitrary. Analogously, it is possible
to imagine structures for roles and objects that are, themselves,
deeply embedded recursive structures. The depth to which a role
or object would need to be decomposed for the puroses of
mapping would depend on the task at hand. For example, mapping
‘John lifted the hammer’ onto ‘Bill raised the book’ may require
little or no decomposition of the predicates ‘lift’ and ‘raise’,
which will have substantial overlap in their semantic features.2
On the other hand, mapping ‘John lifted the hammer’ onto ‘Bill
pushed the cart’ where the predicates have less feature overlap,
may be more likely to depend on decomposition of ‘lift’ into
‘caused to rise’ and ‘push’ into ‘cause to move laterally’, thereby
making explicit the parallelism of their internal structures.
Recursively ‘rise’ and ‘move laterally’ might be decomposed into
structures relating simpler predicates with basic perceptual
primitives representing motion and locations in space residing at
the very bottom.” Hummel and Holyoak (1997, p.457).

Whilst re-representation is a popular idea in the analogy
literature, its current status is largely hypothetical: rerepresentation proposals are usually couched in terms that
relate to computational models, and as yet no evidence has
been offered to support the psychological validity of the
proposal.
The following experiment was designed to formulate a
concrete re-representation proposal, and explore it
empirically. The problem of semantic reconciliation

The relations between the various scenarios in a given
scenario group can be summarised as follows (see also
figure 2): In a group in which re-representation supported
inference A, the target and one candidate base scenario (the
SSB, or structurally supported base) shared only structural
matches; mappings between the SSB’s dictionary entry
and the base dictionary entry also shared only structural
matches.
There was a structural correspondence between the target
structure supported by the target dictionary entry and the
SSB’s dictionary entry which in turn structurally
supported the transfer of candidate inference A in the base.
Mappings between the target and the other candidate
base scenario (the SMB, or surface match supported base)
were supported by shared surface features, and mappings
between the SMB’s dictionary entry and the target
dictionary entry also shared common object descriptions.
However, there was a structural correspondence between
the base structure supported by the base dictionary entry
and the SMB’s dictionary entry which supported candidate
inference B. This allowed participants to use shared surface
features to determine semantic reconciliation, but still use
structural correspondences (c.f. Gentner, 1983) to
determine their inferences (in this case, making a ‘literally
similar’ match at the analogy level; see figure 2).
In a group where re-representation supported inference
B, this pattern of correspondences was reversed.

Materials, Design and Hypotheses
The materials comprised 5 groups of specially constructed
scenarios (figure 1) with corresponding sets of novel
dictionary entries (figure 3) and candidate inferences for
each group (figure 4).
To control for biases towards particular inferences, each
scenario group was further sub-divided into two versions
of the scenario sets, and two versions of the dictionary
entry sets, so that each scenario / dictionary sub-set
supported one of the two different candidate inferences.
To classify the different structural / featural relation
amongst the scenarios, we used Gentner, Ratterman and
Forbus’s (1993) taxonomy of similarity relationships:
• Literal similarity matches include both common
relational structure and common object descriptions;
• Surface matches: based upon common object
descriptions, plus some first order relations;
• Structural similarity, matches based upon
common system of relations.

2 In the second control, participants were given
materials in which the novel terms were removed, and
the structural information in the dictionary entries was
added to the bases and target - in effect creating ‘normal’
analogy materials (see figure 5). In this control, where
no re-representation was required, we expected the
structural commonalities between the target and the
SSB to determine the choice of inference, overriding the
surface commonalities between the target and the SMB
(this would be consistent with previous findings such as
Gentner, 1983).

Figure 4: The target inferences for the stimulus group shown of the
following pages. In a type A set, structural commonalities would
support the A inference; surface similarities would support the B
inference. In a type B set, structural commonalities would support the
A inference; surface similarities would support the A inference.



To try and simplify the above: in each group of
stimuli, the target and candidate base scenario, and their
corresponding dictionary entries, shared surface features,
and a higher order structural correspondence that
corresponded with one candidate inference, whilst the
target and the other candidate base scenario, and their
corresponding dictionary entries, shared structural
correspondences, and a higher order structural
correspondence that corresponded with the alternative
candidate inference. Each stimulus set was divided into
two subsets: in one, structural features in the bases and
their novel term dictionary entries supported one set of
inferences (Type A), whilst in the second sub-set, the
same kind of matches supported the contrasting inference
(Type B), so that biases towards a given inference could be
eliminated (see figure 2).
Experimental Hypothesis
In keeping with the analysis presented above, we
expected that participants would use analogy to reconcile
semantic terms in order to perform analogical mappings
between the scenarios and generate support for one
candidate inference. We predicted that in order to be able
to carry out the top level analogy, participants would carry
out another analogy in parallel - mapping structures only
in the dictionary entries - reconciling semantic terms in a
way that supported the top-level ‘analogical’ structure
mapping over the top-level surface mapping, and favour
the inference that corresponded to the structurally similar
scenario over the scenario that shared only surface features.
Additional Controls and Control Hypotheses
In addition to the basic stimuli, 3 sets of control stimuli
were also created:
1 In the main control, the dictionary entries were
eliminated, and participants were given only the target
and the two candidate bases. In this control, in the
absence of any structural support from the dictionary
entries for the SSB inference, we expected participants
to use the surface commonalities between the target and
the SMB to determine their inference choice (i.e the
prediction was that when subjects were asked to make
an inference in a situation where neither of the base
inferences benefitted from any structural bias,
partcipants would prefer the inference which was
additionally supported at the object level over the
inference that received no such support; consistent with
the findings of previous studies, such as Gentner,
Ratterman and Forbus, 1993, we expected weak
similarity to provide more support than no similarity).

Figure 5: A control set in which the structural information in the
dictionary entries has been included in the bases and target to create an
‘ordinary’ analogical problem. Surface similarities are illustrated in
bold; structural similarities are italicised.

3 In the final control set the dictionary entries were
altered so that surface and structural commonalities all
supported the same mapping (the LSB, or literally
similar base). In this final control, both structural and
surface commonalities between the target and the LSB,
and their dictionary entries were aligned in support of
one inference. Since structure was predicted to be the
key factor in deciding inferences (in line with the
findings of previous studies), we did not expect the
results from this control to differ significantly from the
main experimental task.
In all of the controls, the inference supported by the
various similarities was again randomised to control for
any inherent biases towards particular inferences.

Procedure
Participants were presented with 2 x 6-page
questionnaires, each of which contained one scenario set,
with its dictionary and candidate inferences, a diversionary
task and a scenario set and pair of candidate inferences
without a dictionary (the main control). The order in
which the sets were presented (‘with-dictionary’ versus
‘without-dictionary’ control), was randomised, as was the
presentation order of the targets within the sets. A
second, smaller group of participants were given the other
two controls in similar fashion.
Participants were asked to infer one candidate inference,
and give a confidence rating (1=not at all confident; 5=very
confident). They were told that the dictionary entries
might be useful to them, but told explicitly that the use
of them was left to participants’ discretion.

Results
Consistent with the initial hypothesis, in the main
control condition where no dictionary entries were
provided, the inference that received common surfacefeature support was favoured by 67% of participants, with
only 33% preferring the inference that was not supported
by any commonalities, χ2 (1, N=140) = 17.1, p<.001.
However, in the main experimental condition, where
definitions – which offered the possibility of structural
mappings – were provided, participants reversed their
preferred inference for a given target / candidate bases set.
Again consistent with the initial hypothesis, in this
condition, if participants had preferred the A inference in
the first control, when provided with scenario sets where
structural commonalities in the dictionary supported the B
inference, then participants now chose the B inference.
Overall the inferences which received structural support
were favoured by 71.2% of participants, with only 28.8%
preferring the inference that was supported by surface
commonalities alone, χ2 (1, N=125) = 20.748, p<.001.
Also consistent with the initial hypothesis, in the
control condition with no novel terms, where structure in
the dictionary entries was included in the base and targets,
inferences which received common surface-feature support
were favoured by only 27.0% of participants, with 73.0%
preferring the inference that was supported by structural
commonalities, χ2 (1, N=26) = 3.869, p<.05.
There was no deviation from this pattern in the final
control condition, where the dictionary entries were altered
so that surface and structural commonalities all supported

the same base - target (the LSB) mapping, the inference
supported by the LSB was favoured by 75.0% of
participants, χ2 (1, N=28) = 5.17, p<.05
Analysis of participants’ confidence scores in the main
control show significantly greater confidence for inferences
based on surface commonalities when no structure was
present, t=8.72, p<0.001. However, this trend was
reversed in the other controls and the main experiment given the choice, participants seem to prefer structurally
supported inferences. In the second control condition
(analogies) inferences based upon structural commonalities
received a significantly higher confidence rating than those
based on surface features, t=3.982, p<0.001. Similarly,
in the main experimental condition, when definitions were
provided, inferences based upon structural support received
a significantly higher confidence rating than those based
only on surface commonalities, t=2.9, p<.005. This trend
was repeated in the third control, though mean differences
were not significant, t=1.02, p =0.33.

Discussion
This experiment seems to show, consistent with the rerepresentation hypothesis, that participants can use the
same process that they used to make analogical inferences
to reconcile the semantic discrepancies they encounter in
the representations of base and target analogs.
Participants made inferences with the aid of two targets.
By controlling the structure of the information
representing the ‘semantics’ of the term that was in turn
crucial to the determination of the representation of higher
order structure in the base and each of the targets, we were
able to control the representations participants used for
semantically reconciling particular terms during their
analogising. The re-representation processing prediction –
that participants would use the same mapping process to
match semantic items in their representations as they
would in ultimately determining their analogies – appears
to be supported by the results of this experiment.

General Discussion
Two very reasonable objections might be made to the
results of this experiment:
1. Firstly, the ‘dictionary entries’ in the main task were
artificial: there is a wealth of evidence that definitions are
an inadequate basis for conceptual semantics (see
Komatsu, 1992). Since the ‘dictionary entries’ are no
more than definitions, it seems reasonable to question
whether the use of definitions in exploring conceptual
reconciliation affects the validity of our results.
2. A second obvious objection to the findings of the
experiment is that participants were presented with the
tasks on paper, and had unlimited time in which to solve
the inferencing problems, and reconcile and map any
‘semantics’ in the various base and target specifications.
It might be said in objection that since structure mapping
is a computationally expensive process – especially in
comparison to mapping surface features – this experiment
has little relevance to the on-line demand characteristics of
analogical processing ‘in the wild’. Since participants in
this experiment had unlimited time, and external
representations of the problems, their behaviour is no
predictor of the kind of processes used in making

analogical mappings in memory, where working memory
limits will impose restrictions on processing.
Though we acknowledge our sympathy for these
objections, neither of them should militate against our
interpretation of these results: that the processing of rerepresentations is possible with externally represented
problems. Obviously the second objection – which relates
to internal representations – cannot apply to this
interpretation. In respect of the first, we note that even
though participants used what amounted to definitions in
reconciling semantics in the main inferencing task, it is
the processing that they used to map re-representations in
semantic reconciliation (and not the particulars of the
representations themselves) that is of interest here. To the
extent that participants’ processing matched our
predictions (and what empirical findings there are in
respect of natural representations in similar tasks, e.g.
Ahn, 1998), it seems reasonable to assume that this
processing was ecologically valid, even if the
representations it worked with were not.
These objections do, however, highlight aspects of the
re-representation hypothesis that are still seriously underspecified. In particular, the re-representation hypothesis
lacks detail concerning the representations it supposes, and
the processing demands it appears to make.
In the experiment above, we concentrated on the
semantic reconciliation of one set of similar-but-notidentical terms, and followed this reconciliation process
down through one level of recursion, where we saw –
consistent with the re-representation hypothesis – that the
same process was used to resolve semantic ambiguities as
was used to determine analogical mappings.
However, it is unlikely that realistic representations of
real-world analogies will contain such a small number of
similar yet non-identical predicate matches to reconcile.
These representations will contain many more such
predicates, and the re-representations of these predicates –
whose predicates will need to be matched during semantic
reconciliation of the original predicates – may contain
many more non-identical but semantically similar
predicates, potentially as a factorial of the original number
of predicates re-represented in semantic reconciliation.
Logically, at least, this seems to point to both a
combinatorial explosion – in terms of the number of
predicates to be reconciled, and hence individual semantic
reconciliation sub-processes to be run – and a potential
infinite regress: if an identical mapping process is to be
run recursively, and if re-representation doesn’t ultimately
uncover identical predicate-decomposition representations
at some level, then mapping may not terminate.
One solution to this problem might be the basic
perceptual primitives posited by Hummel and Holyoak
(1997; see above). We see two problems with this
account: firstly, quite what ‘perceptual primitives’ are is
unclear: at present, they offer no more explanatory clarity
than ‘concepts’ when it comes to explaining semantic
reconciliation; and secondly, and more worryingly, this
proposal – like all re-representation hypotheses – assumes
an almost unlimited capacity for structural mapping in
memory. However, recent research (Halford, Wilson and
Phillips, 1998) indicates that in reality this is far from the
case: human capacity for representing and processing

structured information appears to be seriously
constrained.3 In the light of these considerations, we are
cautious in inferring too much from the findings reported
here. We have shown that re-representation is possible in
externally represented tasks. Whether these results can be
replicated in ecological analogy tasks in memory – and the
extent to which re-representation is a viable psychological
account of semantic reconciliation – remain open
questions in need of further empirical investigation.

So far we have only been concerned with re-representation in
relation to the mapping process: these problems will multiply massively
in relation to the semantic reconciliations that must be made in order to
facilitate retrieval.
