Abstract
A Minority-default inflectional system is one in which a regular
affixational process (e.g., the plural morpheme ~s in English)
applies to fewer forms in the language than the irregular stem
modifying process (e.g. the umlauting in “foot-feet”-like pairs).
Following the work of McCarthy & Prince (1990), the plural
system of Modern Standard Arabic has been cited as an archetype of a minority-default system with the regular sound plural
involving fewer nominal forms than the irregular broken plural.
On the basis of linguistic, statistical and distributional evidence,
we argue that this assertion is wrong. We point out that while
both broken and sound plural have qualitatively limited productivity, the latter is quantitatively the more productive process.
Furthermore, the diversity of regularly inflected phonological
forms ensures that they will be treated as the default by a
connectionist model. In the light of these findings we argue that
a good model of morphological processing should motivate the
observation that so few of the world’s languages use minority
defaults.

Introduction
A major debate in psycholinguistics revolves around the
question of how human language users employ finite means
to produce large numbers of words and utterances. In order
to deal with this generic question, several more specific
questions need to be spelt out. One such specific question is
whether or not the structural properties of regularly and
irregularly inflected words correspond to their representational and processing properties. Focusing on the representational format would lead one to tackle the question of
whether morphologically complex words are represented as
full forms or as decomposed morphemes (Marslen-Wilson
et al., 1994). Focussing on the processing aspect of the
equation would lead one to raise the same question from a
different standpoint, namely whether morphologically complex words are formed via a symbolic rule-based mechanism operating on grammatical categories or via a memorybased associative network that extracts probabilistic contingencies between them (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986;
Pinker & Prince 1988; Marslen-Wilson & Tyler, 1998).
The acquisition of the English past tense has been extensively studied in an attempt to decide between the different
approaches to this problem. The literature on the subject
provides at least three different models. The first, and most
traditional assumes that the regular past forms in English
like “walk-walked” are formed by a rule, whereas irregular
past tenses like “eat-ate, give-gave” are learned individually

by rote (Berko, 1958). Because it fails to explain the subregularities among the irregular verbs and the expansion of
irregular inflection to phonologically similar nonce forms,
this view has largely been superseded by a second model
which claims that a rule-governed process inflects all the
regular forms while an associative memory takes care of all
the irregular forms. The associative memory identifies the
irregular forms and blocks the default process from applying to them (Pinker, 1991; Pinker & Prince, 1988). The
third model is a connectionist one, which dispenses with
explicit rules and assumes that language learning is better
accounted for using a single mechanism, namely a network
of interconnected units (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986).
Both regular and irregular forms are inflected by this network, with responses to novel forms depending on their
phonological similarity to familiar patterns (Plunkett &
Marchman, 1991).
Both dual-route models and connectionist networks are
able to handle an inflectional system like English because of
its distributional characteristics. The English system is one
in which about 95% of the forms are regularly inflected.
This is an unproblematic situation for a dual-route model,
which deals with the small number of irregulars via associative memory and the rest via a default rule. A
connectionist network would also exhibit relative ease handling such cases. The network would store information
about all forms and the preponderance of regular forms
would trigger a regularisation process, by virtue of the fact
that any novel form is more likely to resemble a regular
form than an irregular one. Proponents of the dual-route
model have argued that a dual mechanism can also deal
satisfactorily with linguistic systems where the default is a
minority, such as the inflection system in German (Clahsen,
1999). This is because rule-like behavior does not need to
be contingent on the default pattern applying to a majority
of the forms in the language. Rather, a default can be defined, the argument goes, even in terms of the least frequent
patterns, because this process depends on applying the same
procedure to different items bearing the same symbol
(Clahsen, 1999). Conversely, a connectionist network was
predicted to be unable to simulate people’s regularisation of
novel forms in a minority-default system like German.
The Arabic plural is perhaps the most widely cited example of a minority default system (McCarthy & Prince, 1990;
Hare, Daugherty & Seidenberg, 1992; Ravid & Farah,
1999). For this reason it was used as a litmus test by Plun-

kett and Nakisa (1997) who found that a connectionist network can model generalisation behaviour to both regular
and irregular patterns, despite the absence of a default rule.
One of our aims here is to take issue with the position that
Arabic has a minority default plural system, and show that it
hinges on an inaccurate description of the language. In order to come to grips with this claim we will begin by laying
out the morphological system of Modern Standard Arabic
and argue that this language does not exhibit a minoritydefault, using linguistic and corpus analyses. Second, we
will examine the phonological distribution of Arabic nominal forms using a more representative sample than the one
used by Plunkett and Nakisa (1997). All these sources of
evidence converge on the idea that the Arabic plural system
has a majority default of the type learnable by a
connectionist model. We conclude by considering why minority default systems seem scarce across world languages.

The Morphological System of Arabic
Traditionally Arabic surface forms are analysed as consist1
ing of two abstract morphemes a root and a word pattern .
The root usually comprises three consonants and carries
semantic meaning, while the word pattern contains vowels
and conveys syntactic information. According to this approach, the representation of a surface form such as [nuqil]
“be moved” will consist of the root {nql}, and the word
pattern {fuil} where the letters “f, , l” indicate the slots
into which the root consonants map.
The morphology of Arabic falls into two relatively distinct
parts (Bohas & Guillaume, 1984). The first consists of
primitive nouns that are thought to be unrelated to verbs,
although verbs can be derived from them. For example,
from the primitive noun [kalbun] “dog” the verb [kaliba]
“get infected with rabies” can be formed. The second part
relates to verb morphology and subsumes verbs proper and
deverbal nouns. Verb morphology can be further divided
into unaugmented and augmented verb forms. There are
three unaugmented forms and 14 augmented forms of which
only 9 are frequently used in Modern Arabic. As for deverbal nouns, there are about 10 types such as the active participle, passive participle, instance noun, manner noun, “assimilated noun”, and the “masdar” (Holes, 1995).

Verb Morphology
Verb morphology with its two components is the most productive part of the language in the sense of being the main
3
source of most of the transparent derivatives . For example,
combining the root {xr<} “go out” with the pattern {faal},
produces the form [xara<] “go out”. The same root can be
further combined with as many as 5 augmented patterns
yielding the following surface forms: [xarra<] “move out”
1

Within the framework of multilinear phonology the word pattern is further broken down into a vocalic morpheme and a skeletal
morpheme (McCarthy, 1981).
2
Some authors claim that “as many as 400 different surface word
forms can be derived from some triliteral verbs“ (Xasaara, 1994, p.
134)

[!axra<a] “take out”, [taxarra<] “graduate” [taxaara<] “disengage”, [!istaxra<] “extract”. From each of these forms a
host of deverbal nouns can be derived. For example, the
masculine active participle [xaari<un] can be derived from
the unaugmented surface form [xara<]. Also, the following
active participles can be derived respectively from each of
the augmented verb forms above: [muxarri<], [muxri<],
[mutaxarri<], [mutaxaari<], [mustaxri<]. Passive participles
can also be formed from these verb forms. In addition to
this, an “instance noun”, a noun denoting that the action
takes place only once, [xar<atun] “one departure” can be
obtained from the verb [xara<], the noun [taxaaru<] can be
derived from the verb [taxaara<], the noun [!istixraa<] can
be derived from the verb [!istaxra<] and so on. This pattern
of productivity holds even for verbs that are originally derived from primitives. Thus from the primitive noun [kalb]
“dog” the verb [takaalab] “to rave” is derived and from the
latter an active participle [mutakaalib] “someone who raves”
and a noun [takaalub] “raving” are formed. Similarly, loan
words like [talifuun] “telephone” can be used to derive
verbs such as [talfan] “to telephone”, and an active participle like [mutalfin] “phone-caller”.

Nominal Morphology
Arabic nouns undergo various morphological alterations of
which the most frequent is perhaps pluralization. This is
achieved either via suffixation or via pattern modification.
In the first case, known as sound pluralization, the suffix
~uun is added to masculine nouns (e.g. [naa<iÍunnaa<iÍuun] “successful” male) while ~aat is appended to
feminine nouns (e.g. [naa<iÍatun-naa<iÍaat] “successful”
female). In the second, often referred to as broken pluralization, the pattern of the singular noun is dramatically altered and in some cases some of its consonants are lost (e.g.
[unquud-anaqiid] “cluster” [andaliib-anaadil] “nightingale” (Murtonen, 1964; Xasaara, 1994; Holes, 1995). Sound
pluralization is considered as regular inflection because it
involves little or no allomorphy while broken pluralization
is irregular because it is rich with allomorphic variations.
McCarthy & Prince’s (1990) work on the broken plural in
Modern Standard Arabic has promulgated the idea of Arabic having a minority default system of pluralization. According to them the sound plural is “systematically found
only with the following short list: proper names; transparently derived nouns or adjectives such as participles, deverbals and diminutives; non-canonical or unassimilated
loans and the names of the letters of the alphabet”
(McCarthy & Prince, 1990: p. 212). Phrased as such, the
above claim is misleading because it fails to distinguish
between qualitative and quantitative productivity. The distinction between these two aspects of productivity rests on
the difference between the number and/or the strength of the
constraints weighing on a particular morphological process
(Aronoff & Anshen, 1998). Perhaps an English example
will help to bring our point home. The suffix ~ity is qualitatively productive but quantitatively unproductive. This is
because it tends to be appended preferentially to adjectives
ending in suffixes like ~ible, ~able, ~ic, ~id etc. Conversely
the suffix ~ness, is quantitatively productive because it is
subject to fewer constraints and is not restricted to follow a

limited set of suffixes (Aronoff & Anshen, 1998). Arabic
sound and broken pluralization processes lend themselves
readily to a description in terms of a distinction between
qualitative and quantitative productivity. Both are subject to
few constraints. Sound pluralization is restricted to a set of
nominal forms that must meet formal (e.g., length in syllables) and syntactic criteria (e.g. being preferably adjectives).
But broken pluralization is subject to even more rigid and
more numerous formal (e.g. length and syllabic structure)
and syntactic criteria (e.g. being preferably a substantive).
Quantitatively, however sound pluralization would not be a
minority case even if it were found only with transparent
derivatives. Transparent derivatives, as we will shortly
show, correspond to the most productive part of the language. Additionally, sound pluralization affects systematically all recent loan words comprising more than three letters like [dimuqraatiyyun] “democracy”, [talfazatun] “television”.

Type Frequency of Broken and Sound Plurals
A given triliteral root in Arabic can be productively
mounted on some combination of the 9 frequent augmented
word patterns to create new words. For instance, the triliteral unaugmented surface form [katab] “write” can be
combined with as many as 7 augmented forms. Conversely,
the unaugmented triliteral [aba6] “fool around” gives rise
only to one augmented form [aaba6] “banter”. Although
no systematic statistical work on the number of augmented
and unaugmented verb forms is available in Arabic, one
may safely hypothesise that triliteral roots can yield on average at least three surface forms. Confining our analysis to
active and passive participles in the masculine and feminine
forms, we can plausibly say that each of the augmented
forms gives rise to at least 4 deverbal forms. There are
11978 roots of which 7597 are triliterals, 4081 are quadriliterals and 300 are quinquiliterals (Moussa, 1996). Assuming that the derivation of four masculine and four feminine deverbal surface forms from each root is not an overestimate, the triliteral roots alone will yield as many as
91164 surface forms that take a sound plural. If we consider
the derivatives from quadriliteral and quinquiliterals, this
estimate will increase greatly.
It is true that some transparent derivatives like “assimilated nouns” and lexicalized active participles often pluralize in the broken way. This does not mean that nouns taking
a broken plural will outnumber those pluralizing regularly
because for almost every assimilated noun or indeed for any
other noun that has a broken plural, there is either a diminutive form, a feminine form or both, and these take a sound
plural. Thus the assimilated noun [aaqir] “barren” has the
broken plural [awaaqir], whereas its diminutive [uwaiqir]
has the sound feminine plural [uwaiqiraat]. Likewise, the
primitive noun [qird] “monkey” has a broken plural [quruud] but its feminine form [qirdatun] “female monkey” has
a sound plural form [qirdaatun].
The type of pluralization taken by a particular nominal
form may be driven by semantic considerations as well.
Many active participles, derived from roots mounted on the
unaugmented pattern, like [kaatib] may pluralize regularly

or irregularly depending on whether they function as a substantive or as an adjective. Used as a substantive to denote a
permanent activity or quality, they form a broken plural.
Thus when the token [kaatib] is used in the sense of
“author”, it has the broken plural [kuttaab]. By contrast,
when it is used in the sense of “someone who writes”, it
pluralizes regularly as [kaatibuuna].
In order to support our claim statistically, we analysed all
nouns listed in the “Basic Lexicon of Modern Standard
Arabic” (henceforth BLMSA), which consists of the 3000
most frequent words in the language (Khouloughli, 1992).
The BLMSA is based on a statistical analysis of more than
200,000 words drawn from newspapers and literary work
throughout the Arab world. The author reports a total of
4
1670 nominal forms (i.e. nouns and adjectives). Of these,
666 tokens are explicitly listed as taking a broken plural and
610 as taking a sound plural (215 masculine and 395 feminine). For the remaining 394 words, the author lists either
the plural form (sound or broken) with no mention of the
singular or vice versa. The 394 words divide into 357 singular forms for which the corresponding sound plural is not
listed, 11 sound plural forms without their relevant singular
forms, 20 singular forms without their corresponding broken plurals, and 6 broken plurals for which the corresponding singulars are not listed. Possibly the author lists only the
singular or the plural of these forms because the other is not
one of the 3000 most frequent words of the language. However, this does not mean that they would be hapax legomena
in a larger database if this were available. Indeed many of
the unlisted words like [murabbaaat] “squares” and
[!aaliha] “gods” the respective sound and broken plural
forms of the listed singular forms [murabba] “square” and
[!ilaah] “god” are part of the familiar repertoire of words
that can be encountered even in children’s books.
In sum, of the 1670 most frequent nominal forms of the
language almost two thirds, 978 nouns, pluralize via suffix
addition and the remaining forms take a broken plural. This
is important for two reasons. First, testing a few random
samples taken from the BLMSA shows that it has an average coverage of 75 to 95% of any Modern Arabic text. So if
the BLMSA is representative, we can infer that about 56%
of Arabic words are nouns (i.e. lexical nouns and adjectives) and most critically that about 59% of all nouns of the
language take a sound plural while only 41% take a broken
plural. Because BLMSA is a sample of the most frequent
words, it is likely that lower frequency nouns are even more
skewed towards the regular plural.
In view of this, it seems untenable to consider Modern
Standard Arabic as an example of a minority-default system. Just why this stance has come to be held is an offshoot
of Arabic lexicographers’ work that lists only the broken
plural forms because they are unpredictable.
In this section, we have laid out linguistic and corpusbased evidence that the Arabic plural system is not a minority-default. The affixational process involves far more
words than the templatic processes, although the proportion

4

The remaining 1330 items listed in the BLMSA comprise verbs
and the closed classes of particles, prepositions and conjunctions.

is still not as high as the English past tense system, with
95% regulars (Daugherty & Seidenberg, 1992).

The Phonological Distribution of Sound and
Broken Plurals
The supposed status of the Arabic plural as a minority default system has resulted in claims that it cannot be accommodated by a connectionist model. Plunkett and Nakisa
(1997) examined this claim using statistical analyses and
connectionist simulations. They noted that a minority default is not necessarily a problem for a connectionist account provided there is an even distribution of regulars and
relatively tight clustering of irregulars in the phonological
space spanned by the uninflected forms (cf. Hare, Elman &
Daugherty, 1995). In cases where irregulars share strong
phonological resemblances, but the minority of regulars
vary widely in their phonological form, a multi-layered
connectionist network can develop “distributional default”
behaviour. Although the irregulars may be dominant in
number, they are concentrated in relatively small pockets of
the network’s input space, and so are unlikely to be similar
to novel items. Instead, most novel inputs will be more
similar to a regular item, and so will be inflected in the same
way leading to default behaviour.
Plunkett and Nakisa (1997) examined the phonological
distribution of Arabic singulars in this respect using a set of
nouns drawn from the Wehr Arabic Dictionary (Wehr,
1976). On the basis of statistical analyses of the distribution
of singulars in phonological space, they argued that the
Arabic plural system does not provide a basis for developing a distributional default. Instead of evenly spanning the
phonological space, the sound plurals appeared to be even
more phonologically coherent than many of the broken plural sets. A connectionist network trained on the singular to
plural mapping for these items would therefore be unlikely
to develop behaviour resembling a default rule.
Plunkett and Nakisa (1997) also showed that despite the
absence of the conditions necessary for developing default
behaviour, a connectionist model was able to learn and generalise the pluralization task rather well. In fact generalisation (i.e., performance on untrained patterns) in the network
was superior to a dual-route model irrespective of the division of labour between the two routes. In effect, the network
was performing adequately with neither a majority nor a
minority default.
The work of Plunkett and Nakisa (1997) is important because it marks out the conditions necessary for default-like
behaviour in a connectionist model of morphological processing. The behaviour of a connectionist system does not
just depend on the numbers of regular and irregular items. It
also depends on the distribution of these items in
phonological space. However, with respect to the specific
case of Arabic, there are still many unanswered questions.
Since the data-source used by Plunkett and Nakisa (1997)
has, as we have argued, a bias in the proportions of sound
and broken plurals, the detailed predictions made in their
paper may be unfounded. We have already argued that
sound plurals are in the majority in Arabic, but this is not
enough to demonstrate that a connectionist system will learn

to treat them in a default-like way. The phonological properties of a representative sample of the language must also
be examined in order to assess the basis for a distributional
default. If it turns out that both sound and broken plural
classes are phonologically well defined and compact, then a
“no default” system would be predicted on the basis of
Plunkett and Nakisa (1997).
The 1670 nominal forms were classified by plural type,
and the 16 categories that contained 10 or more members
were used in the analyses and these amounted to 1491
items. Of these, 972 took the sound plural (273 masculine
forms and 699 feminine forms). The remaining 519 items
were members of 14 broken plural subtypes, containing
between 13 and 121 nouns). In order to examine the
phonological similarities between the members of these
groups, each singular form was translated into a featural
code based on a slight modification of the template system
of Plunkett and Nakisa (1997). First, the phonemic transcriptions for the singular forms were aligned to an 18-slot
template consisting of alternating consonants and vowels.
The slots were filled from left to right, with consonants
placed in consonant slots and vowels in vowel slots. When a
word contained two consonants or vowels in a row, this
procedure led to an empty slot between them, but it also
ensured that as far as possible the representations reflected
similarities between words by comparing like with like. For
example, the representation of /jurÍun/ “scar” in the template was jur-HUn-----------. The slot-based phoneme representations were then translated into featural representations in order to capture similarities between different phonemes. The outcome of this transformation was an
18 slot x 20 features (360 dimensional) vector for each singular form. Taking the dataset as a whole, the vectors span a
360 dimensional space, in which each word form is a point.
The issue we address is how the different plural classes are
distributed in this multidimensional space.
Principal components analysis takes a set of points in a
high dimensional space and determines a smaller set of orthogonal vectors within this space that captures the greatest
variation between the points. The original points can be
projected on to these principal components to extract a low
dimensional plot preserving the most important information
from the high dimensional space and eliminating redundant
dimensions. Figure 1 plots the positions of the different plural subtypes in the space defined by the first three principal
components. For the sample used by Plunkett and Nakisa
(1997), the sound plurals occupied relatively restricted positions in the space. For our sample, the sound plurals are
fairly ubiquitous. There are many completely empty regions
of the space, corresponding to phoneme combinations that
are in some way badly formed, but most of the occupied
regions are occupied by sound plurals, whereas the broken
plurals sets are generally more coherent. Plunkett and
Nakisa (1997) quantified their observations by calculating a
coherence measure for each plural subtype. However, this
measure is less valuable for our dataset (containing plural
types of greatly varying size) because it is confounded with
set size, such that larger sets will be rated as more coherent
purely because of their size.

Figure 1: Phonological distribution of Arabic singulars across
a plane through the first three principal component. Pluses mark
broken plurals, dots mark sound plurals.
Instead, we looked at the relative isolation of the regular
and irregular groups as a whole. Put simply, for the regulars
to act as the distributional default in a connectionist model
there should be a high chance that a randomly chosen nonword will be most similar to one of the existing regulars,
and therefore will be processed in the same way. Each word
in the language will have it’s own “sphere” of influence in
the phonological space—if any novel form falls in this area,
it will be closest to that point and will tend to be inflected in
the same way.
The most influential items in the language will be the
ones with the largest area of influence. We can analyse
these areas by calculating, for each word in the language,
the distance from the nearest neighbour (both of the same
class and of any class). The class that exerts the most influence will be the one that has the most isolated members,
because these words will have the greatest influence in
terms of generalisation to novel forms. This analysis shows
that not only are there more sound plurals in Arabic, but
they are more spread out in the phonological space, and so
have a greater sphere of influence. Sound plurals differ
from their nearest neighbour by 4.9 features on average,
whereas broken plural differ by 3.7. This advantage is independent of the number of items in each plural class. When
nearest neighbour distances are broken down by overall
class, the combined effect of numerical dominance and
greater area of influence becomes clear, sound plurals differ
from their nearest broken plural by 12.2 features on average, whereas broken plurals differ from their nearest sound
plural by 6.0 features on average. This statistic implies that
it is easy to find sound plurals that are unlike any broken
plural but difficult to find broken plurals that are unlike any
sound plural. This finding is confirmed in Figure 2, which
plots only the singular forms that are 8 or more features
different from their nearest neighbour of the opposite class
(68% of the sound plurals, and 25% of the broken plurals).
The broken plurals are quite closely packed in tight pockets
of the space, whereas the sound plurals are more spread out.
This is exactly the state of affairs required for distributional
default behaviour to develop in a connectionist model.

General Discussion
Much of the evidence relating to the debate between symbolic and connectionist accounts has stemmed from the
study of the English past tense, in which regulars are numerically dominant. Proponents of the symbolic account
have challenged the ability of connectionist models to deal
with inflectional systems in which the default inflection is a
minority. Modern Standard Arabic and German were taken
as instances of languages that do not depend on the regular
pattern involving the majority of forms. Connectionist
simulations of minority default behavior (Hare et al., 1995;
Plunkett & Nakisa, 1997) have refined the debate, by
showing that minority default systems are not necessarily
problematic for a connectionist model. If the distribution of
regulars is sufficiently broad, then a connectionist model
can develop default-like behavior (Hare et al., 1995). Even
in the case where regulars are more tightly clustered, a
connectionist model can learn the mapping, and perform
generalization, although the regular will not become a true
default (Plunkett & Nakisa, 1997). These studies emphasize
the importance of phonological distribution in the analysis
of linguistic systems, alongside the numerical information.
Our main point in this paper was to argue that the Arabic
plural system is not a minority default, with regular sound
plural applying to fewer forms than the idiosyncratic broken
plural. Three sets of arguments were brought to bear on our
claim. First, we have shown that while both broken and
sound plural are qualitatively productive, only the latter
reflects quantitative productivity. Second, the empirical
investigation of the most frequent nominal forms collected
from BLMSA demonstrates that sound pluralization involves almost twice as many word forms as broken pluralization. The sound plural does not have a low type frequency. Third, analyses of similarities in phonological space
showed that the distribution of Arabic nominal forms follow
much the same pattern as that of English verbs.
Our analysis raises a set of problems relative to current
models of human language productivity. Symbolic models
are perfectly compatible with languages exhibiting a minority default inflectional system, but do not provide a princi-

pled explanation for the scarcity of these cases. This follows
from the assumption that the human cognitive processor
manipulates symbols and does not need a majority of forms
to show a rule-based behavior. So far as we know only
German and Arabic are cited as current examples of such
systems. As it is demonstrated above Arabic is not and Bybee (1995) offered an account that questioned the claim that
German is a minority default. Note however, that from the
perspective of language change we do not exclude the possibility of a linguistic system passing through a minority
default inflectional system. Rather, our point is: if minority
default systems are as natural and as easy to handle as symbolic models would have it, then why do they seem to be
scarce?
Connectionist models, meanwhile, have responded to the
challenge of the minority default. These systems are less at
ease with a minority default system, since they require the
regulars to have sufficient variety in their phonological form
if they are to be treated as the default case. But more critically, they also offer an explanation for the lack of minority
defaults in most modern languages. Hare and Elman (1995)
used connectionist networks to model the diachronic
changes in the verb system of Old English, which at some
stage is likely to have been a minority default system. Developments in the structure of language were assumed to be
the product of imperfect learning from generation to generation, modeled by generations of connectionist networks.
In essence, the development of the language was one of
regularization, with regulars becoming more and more
dominant in each successive generation. Thus, minority
defaults can be learned by a connectionist network as long
as certain distributional conditions are met. Even when
those conditions are met, however, the state of the language
is somewhat unstable, with a diachronic movement towards
majority default likely in the long term. This fits in with the
observation that the vast majority of linguistic systems—
including the Arabic plural—do not employ a minority default.
