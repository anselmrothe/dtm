Abstract

A divergence in attribution styles can be observed not only
for self-caused events, but also for other-caused events.
Recent studies on attribution tendencies suggest that members of “individualistic” Western cultures are also more
prone to the fundamental attribution error than members of
“collectivistic” cultures such as the Chinese: The former typically tend to overestimate dispositional factors and therefore
ascribe higher personal responsibility than collectivistically
oriented people, who more readily take situational influences
into account (Choi & Nisbett, 1998; Morris, Nisbett, &
Peng, 1995; Morris, Menon & Ames, 2001).
Attribution styles are not only interesting in themselves,
but also have cognitive implications and affect emotional
responses. Attributing causation and ascribing responsibility
are crucial factors in differentiating between emotions such
as anger or shame (e.g., Lazarus, 1991; Smith & Ellsworth,
1985). In this case, cultural differences in attribution styles
should imply cultural differences in respective emotions. In
other words, discounting responsibility should calm anger.
In order to examine this hypothesis, we compared Germany with the Polynesian culture of Tonga. This island
Kingdom in the South Pacific, once named the “Friendly
Islands” by Captain Cook, is renowned for the amicability of
its inhabitants. As negative emotions are disapproved of, it is
difficult to decide whether Tongans only display or actually
feel anger less frequently. The latter could be the case if people tend to take situational factors into consideration when
ascribing responsibility for bad deeds to others. In that case,
however, the same process should also reduce gratitude for
good deeds. While a similar pattern may be expected in
cases of self-caused events – leading to lower shame or pride
in Tonga due to lower responsibility ascription – we rather
assume a pattern consistent with the self-serving bias in Germany and the reversed pattern in Tonga.
In our study, these assumed influences of self-concept on
attribution tendencies and emotional responses were experimentally tested. Before presenting this experiment and its
results, we will outline the relevant theoretical assumptions
and highlight essential aspects of Tongan culture.

Appraisal theories of emotion assume that similar evaluations
of an event result in similar emotions, whereas the evaluation
itself may depend on culturally defined concepts, experiences,
and values. In other words, cognitions are crucial for the elicitation and differentiation of emotions, and the impact that
culture has on emotions is enclosed in their cognitive determinants. Based on this approach, our interdisciplinary project
compares the cognitive elicitation of six emotions in Tonga
and Germany. It tests the hypothesis that – driven by different
self-concepts and corresponding attribution tendencies – members of both cultures ascribe responsibility to others and self in
diverging manners. Consequently, responses should differ
when it comes to emotions that hinge on these attributions.
Our experimental data supports this hypothesis.
Key words: Cognition, Emotion, Culture, Appraisal Theory,
Ascription of Responsibility, Attribution Biases.

Introduction
Imagine that you are taking part in a performance of your
local amateur theatre group. Everything is going like clockwork, and the audience is enthusiastic. You will most likely
be convinced that this is due to a great extent to your part in
the performance. However, if the performance turns out to be
clumsy, and the audience starts murmuring with dissatisfaction, you might focus more on your colleagues’ weaknesses
and failures, blame the bad acoustics or even the audience.
People easily take credit for positive outcomes while tending to blame others for failures. Such a self-serving bias
(Miller & Ross, 1975) can be observed in daily life, in the
public sphere and, most pronounced, among politicians. It is
nothing to feel ashamed of as it is reinforced by the individualistic values of Western cultures. Maintaining and enhancing one’s self-esteem is consistent with those values that also
emphasize an independent self-concept, the importance of
personal accomplishments for one’s identity, and the focus
on rights over duties. In more collectivistic cultures, on the
other hand, the self is seen as interdependent, as part of
larger social groups that bind and mutually obligate the person; duties are valued over rights, and social harmony is of
prime concern (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Oyserman,
Coon, & Kemmelmeier, 2002). As smooth interpersonal
relationships are more important than one’s self-esteem,
members of collectivistic cultures may apply a reversed selfserving attribution style in more readily taking the blame for
negative outcomes (e.g., Anderson, 1999).

Cognitive Determinants for Emotions
Despite a popular view of cognition and emotion as antagonists, emotions are, to a large extent, shaped by cognitions.
Imagine that you enter a public transport vehicle and a young
man offers you his seat. Will you feel gratitude? Or shame?

Probably even anger? It depends on how you appraise the situation. If you are of older age and your leg is hurting terribly
this morning, you may very well appreciate the boy’s consideration. If, on the other hand, this interaction makes you
aware of the fact that you are getting on in years, sadness or
shame may result. And if you like to think of yourself as
independent and spry, the kind offer might even come across
as an insult. Such cognitive determinants for emotions are
captured by appraisal theories of emotions.

Responsibility

Appraisal theories assume that emotions are elicited and differentiated by the cognitive appraisal of an event (e.g.,
Frijda, 1993; Lazarus, 1991; Ortony, Clore & Collins, 1988;
Roseman, Antoniou & Jose, 1996; Scherer, Schorr &
Johnstone, 2001; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985). Appraising situations in similar ways should lead to similar emotions, while
appraising them differently should lead to different emotions
– irrespective of culture. What should be prone to cultural
influences is the way in which a certain event or situation
will be appraised. If, for instance, a person regards a situation as an insult, a likely response will be anger. But whether
he or she regards the situation as insult will depend on a
whole range of factors, among them culture-specific concepts, values, and norms (e.g., Mesquita & Ellsworth, 2001;
Mesquita & Frijda, 1992; Scherer, 1997).
While all appraisal theories share the same assumption –
that the elicitation of a specific emotion is linked to a corresponding set of criteria perceived in an event – there is still
some debate with regard to the exact nature of these sets of
criteria or “cognitive determinants”. Most of them, however,
agree that valence (outcome of event) and causation (agency
and/or responsibility) are important at least for certain emotions (e.g., Ellsworth & Smith, 1988a; Lazarus, 1991; Nerb
& Spada, 2001; Roseman et al., 1996; Weiner, 1995).

cumstantial when personal responsibility is assessed as low
(cf. also Smith & Ellsworth, 1985).
For our scenarios, we therefore decided to distinguish only
between high responsibility (personal causation: agency
either by self or other) and low responsibility (circumstances). In negative events, the most appropriate emotions
corresponding to the corners of this triangle (Figure 1) are
anger, shame, and sadness (Smith & Ellsworth, 1985, p.828;
see also Roseman et al., 1996). In other words: If I ascribe
high responsibility to someone who caused some damage, a
likely response will be anger. If I find out that it was not his
fault but triggered by circumstances beyond his control, sadness may prevail; and if I have to take the blame myself, I
will feel shame.
Although positive emotions are typically less differentiated than negative ones (e.g., Ellsworth & Smith, 1988b), a
positive complement can be identified for all three negative
emotions: gratitude (for other-caused events), pride (for selfcaused events), and joy (for circumstances).

Agency, Responsibility, and Valence:
Six Emotions
The relevant dimensions for our study are the degree to
which people attribute causation to various sources and
ascribe responsibility. In principle, events can be caused by
oneself, another person, or circumstances, and responsibility
can be considered as rather high or low.
Causation and responsibility are logically, but not empirically independent dimensions. An event can be caused by a
person who might not be responsible for it in the strictest
sense. If somebody drops a glass because he slips on the
floor, we may still consider him as the cause, but not as
responsible. It is not entirely clear, though, whether low personal responsibility is much different from circumstantial
causation. Rather, the more we consider circumstances to be
“responsible”, the less likely we will focus on the person as
the source of causation. In addition, folk psychological theories and terminologies do not differentiate emotional
responses to all combinations of causation and responsibility. While self- and other-caused events elicit clearly different emotions when high responsibility is ascribed, causation
is less clearly attributed and may even be regarded as cir-

Cultural Differences and Consequences
If we assume that a cognitive determinant like the ascription
of responsibility is crucial for the elicitation and differentiation of specific emotions, then cultural differences in attribution style and in the tendency to ascribe responsibility should
lead to different emotional responses, at least in terms of
intensity (e.g., Mesquita & Ellsworth, 2001; Scherer, 1997).
With regard to events primarily caused by others, the fundamental attribution error, more pronounced in individualistic cultures, should result in ascribing higher responsibility
to others, thereby also enhancing anger and gratitude, while
in collectivistic cultures, personal responsibility – together
with the subsequent emotional responses – should be
reduced. With regard to events primarily caused by the self,
the self-serving bias, more pronounced in individualistic cultures, should favor taking the credit and feeling pride in positive events, but putting the blame (and shame) on somebody
else in negative events. In collectivistic cultures, this pattern
should be either less pronounced or even reversed: More

66

readily giving credit to others should reduce pride, while taking the blame should enhance shame.
Finding such a correspondence would provide not only
support for appraisal theoretical assumptions, but also a cognitive explanation for cultural differences that is more differentiated than usually available. Yet, the meta-analysis
conducted by Oyserman et al. (2002) gives no hint that this
line of argument has been experimentally tested so far. Our
study tries to fill this gap. It is based on the assumption that
the cognitive processes preceding emotions are universal, but
the conceptual content on which these processes operate are
culture-specific. It scrutinizes the tendencies of ascribing responsibility and its correspondence with emotional responses. Furthermore, it compares two cultures that diverge
with regard to self-concept, namely Germany and Tonga.

pile sorting tasks, and linguistic analyses (not reported here).
Materials. The experimental material consisted of two parts.
The first part included several context stories (vignettes),
each followed by a set of questions, and the second part
included different scales. All materials were presented in the
participants’ native language and used customary names for
the persons involved. Only those parts of the material and
results relevant to our current question are reported here.
Part 1: Six context stories crossed three sources of causation (Other / Self / Circumstances) with two outcomes of an
event (positive [+] / negative [–]). Two sources of causation
(i.e., O and S) corresponded to high personal responsibility,
while the third (i.e., C) corresponded to low personal responsibility. To vary the source of causation, three different stories were used, while the outcome of the event was varied by
modification (printed in Italics) of the respective story:

Values, Self-Concept, and Emotions in Tonga
Tongan society is hierarchically structured, with older people
having a higher rank than younger ones, and sisters higher
than brothers. Linked with these differences in rank are
social rules of respect and obedience, which are supposed to
reflect 'ofa (“love, concern, or generosity”). 'Ofa characterizes the ideal emotional relationship between people (Morton, 1996). Cooperation and sharing with others are core
values (e.g. Bender, 2002; Evans, 2001), social harmony is
particularly emphasized and, consequently, negative emotions and open conflicts are disapproved of. Accordingly, a
strong interdependent self-concept can be assumed to prevail
in Tonga. Previous studies supported this assumption, revealing a significantly stronger interdependent self-concept for
Tongans than Germans (and even Chinese), while the independent aspects of the self were rated rather similarly (Beller
& Bender, 2004; Beller, Bender, & Song, subm.). These
studies also suggest that in social relationships and interactions, situational factors are taken into account more readily
in Tonga than in Germany when ascribing responsibility.

Experiment: Self-Concept, Attributions,
and Emotions in Germany and Tonga

Each story was followed by several questions. The first asked
for ratings of emotional responses in the situation. A multiple-choice format was used with 19 emotions, among them
anger (German: Ärger, Tongan: 'ita), shame (Scham, ma),
sadness (Traurigkeit, loto-mamahi), gratitude (Dankbarkeit,
fakamalo), pride (Stolz, polepole), and joy (Freude, fiefia).
Although not all terms are entirely congruent across languages, congruence is high for the relevant notions. For each
emotion, participants had to indicate its intensity on a fivepoint scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“very strong”).
Subsequent questions asked for evaluations of how
responsible other, self, or circumstances were. Again, participants had to indicate their ratings on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“completely”).
Part 2: In addition to the questionnaire, we asked for
aspects of the self-concept (independent vs. interdependent
construal of the self). After pretesting the original scale of
Singelis (1994) in both cultures, two items on each subscale
were deleted. Both subscales therefore consisted of ten
items. People were instructed to rate the degree to which

The experiment is motivated by three hypotheses: The
respective cultural differences in self-concept should have an
impact on (1) the fundamental attribution error, (2) the selfserving bias, and (3) emotions related to high ascription of
responsibility, particularly anger. More precisely, we
expected that – corresponding to being more interdependent
– Tongans should more readily take situational factors into
consideration when ascribing responsibility to others and
should more readily take the blame in ambiguous situations.
Germans, on the other hand, should largely disregard situational factors, thus ascribing higher responsibility to others,
and avoid taking the blame in ambiguous situations. Consequently, Tongan participants should feel less anger and gratitude in other-caused events, and more shame but less pride in
self-caused events than German participants.

Method
In order to ensure a valid choice of terminology and scenarios, the construction of the experimental material was

67

each statement applied to them on a five-point scale ranging
from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“completely”).
Design. The study compared two countries in a correlational
design (Germany and Tonga). The six context stories were
presented within-subjects and in various different orders to
control for order effects. Each story started on a new page;
the questions were presented in the same order as described
above.
Participants. Both samples consisted of students from
higher classes of secondary schools, one in Lahr, Germany,
the other in Pangai, Tonga. The German sample consisted of
39 students, 20 of whom were male and 19 female. The Tongan sample consisted of 21 students, 9 of whom were male
and 12 female.
Procedure. The data collection took place in the classrooms.
Each participant received a booklet with general instructions,
the questionnaire, and the scales. They were instructed to
answer all questions in the given order, and were granted as
much time as they needed.

Across all scenarios, ascription of responsibility generally
followed the expected pattern for cultural differences: German ratings of other-responsibility were higher than Tongan
ratings in all scenarios except [S+], and Tongan ratings of
self-responsibility were higher than German ratings in all
scenarios except [S+] and [S–], although these were not significant. Attributions to circumstances were higher in Tonga
than in Germany in all scenarios (although only significantly
in two scenarios).
Comparing positive and negative scenarios suggests that
participants from both cultures were generally more ready to
take credit than blame. However, Tongan participants also
gave high credit to others when actually the self was to be
praised [S+].
Emotions in Positive Scenarios: From the emotions asked
for in the positive scenarios, three are reported here: gratitude, pride, and joy (Table 2).

Results and Discussion

Scenario

All data were analyzed by means of one-factor analyses of
variance, with the between-subjects factor country.
Self-Concept: In line with previous studies, we expected the
Tongan students to be more socially oriented than the German students. We found no differences between the two
samples on the independence scale (in fact, the low Cronbach α did not allow us to interpret this scale), but did find
differences on the interdependence scale. The mean interdependence value was 2.29 in Germany (SD = .499) and 3.27
in Tonga (SD = .692); F(1, 54) = 37.399, p < .001. As
expected, the Tongan students judged themselves to be more
interdependent than the German students.
Attribution Tendencies: In four out of six scenarios, the
highest ascriptions of responsibility followed the pattern
intended by scenario construction (Table 1): Responsibility
was ascribed to other in the scenarios caused by others ([O+]
and [O–]) and to self in the self-caused scenarios ([S+] and
[S–]). In the two events construed as caused by circumstances ([C+] and [C–]), Germans ascribed responsibility to
others, while Tongans predominantly ascribed responsibility
to self.

In all positive scenarios, the positive responses prevailed
in both samples, except for [O+]. Here, Tongan participants
rated shame (1.81) higher than pride (1.10) because they also
took the blame for the bad mark.
Apart from this, the responses followed the pattern
expected from the item construction in the German case:
gratitude in [O+], pride in [S+], and joy in [C+]. In Tonga,
this was not equally obvious, as here, all scenarios predominantly elicited joy. However, the emotions rated in second
place after joy reflect the predicted pattern.
Emotions in Negative Scenarios: From the emotions asked
for in the negative scenarios, three are reported here: anger,
shame, and sadness (Table 3).
In all negative scenarios, negative responses prevailed in
both samples, except for [C–]. Here, Tongan participants
rated joy (2.11) and pride (1.88) higher than shame (1.50)
because they appreciated that the visit had taken place at all.
Apart from this, the responses focused almost entirely on
sadness as the prevailing emotion in all scenarios and both

by anger. A remarkable divergence from the pattern predicted by appraisal theories appears in [S–], where shame
indeed prevailed in the Tongan sample, but was ranked last
in the German sample.

responsibility to self or to others. We found that the ratings
of self-responsibility did not differ at all across cultures.
They were generally higher for positive than for negative
events, thus indicating a self-serving bias in both cultures.
However, the emotions elicited differed significantly. We
therefore again have to take into account the ratings of otherresponsibility, and these do diverge in interesting ways (Figure 3): In the positive scenario, Tongans ascribe more
responsibility to others than Germans, while in the negative
scenario the opposite is true. This interaction corresponds to
the difference in emotional responses: the higher rating of
other-responsibility in [S+] with reduced pride among Tongan participants, and the higher rating of other-responsibility
in [S–] with reduced shame among German participants.
These findings are consistent with a self-serving attribution
style among Germans and a reduced or even reversed pattern
among Tongans.

General Discussion

2

Overall, the results indicate that Germans and Tongans
indeed apply diverging attribution styles corresponding to
cultural differences in self-concept. Germans tend to ascribe
high responsibilities to others for good and bad deeds
equally, responding with high gratitude or anger. Tongans
ascribe less responsibility to others, and accordingly their
respective emotions are less intensive.
In self-caused events, members of both cultures are more
ready to take responsibility for good deeds than for bad (selfserving bias), and their ratings do not differ cross-culturally.
What does differ, again, is the ascription of responsibility to
others: Germans do so to a greater degree for bad deeds,
while Tongans do so for good deeds. This corresponds to a
strong self-serving bias in Germany, eliciting relatively little
shame for bad deeds, but much pride for good ones. The
reversed attribution tendency in Tonga eclipses the self-serving bias and produces a high degree of shame for bad deeds
and a lower degree of pride for good ones.
With regard to scenarios caused by circumstances, we
obtained partly unexpected results. None of our samples
accepted circumstances as the prime explanation for the
event. This may be an artefact from the scenario chosen, but
in addition indicates a deeper conceptual problem: While in
our rather ambiguous scenarios [C+] and [C–] it is easy to
detect a personal causation for the event, people tend to persistently search for an agent even in scenarios with explicit
non-human causation. This tendency may not be restricted to
Western cultures, as a previous study on environmental attributions suggests (Nerb, Bender, & Spada, in press): When
asked to what extent an instance of damage (i.e., dying fish)
was caused by man, both Tongan and German participants
ascribed responsibility to human actors – even in those scenarios that elaborated on the natural causation.
Apart from the rather low ratings of circumstantial causation, ascription of responsibility in the scenarios [C+] and
[C–] followed the predictions insofar as Germans favored
other-responsibility and Tongans favored self-responsibility.
Emotional responses, on the other hand, followed from
appraisal theoretical predictions as though they were not
affected by diverging attribution tendencies. In other words:

Ascription of responsibility and emotional responses did not
correspond for joy or sadness, which may be an indication of
a more complex relationship between the two factors (cf.
Nerb & Spada, 2001).
Overall, the patterns for ascribing responsibility to others
and self and the corresponding emotions follow the cultural
differences in self-concept in the expected way. It is always
difficult, if not impossible, to prove causal links between cultural features and behavioral data in a semi-experimental
design. But as our data is consistent with previous studies on
Tongan emotions (Beller & Bender, 2004; Beller et al.,
subm.; Bender, 2002) and with research on other collectivistic cultures (e.g., Anderson, 1999; Morris et al., 1995), we
consider it safe to conclude that cultural preferences affect
not only attribution tendencies, but also – in emphasizing
personal responsibility differently – subsequent emotional
responses.
