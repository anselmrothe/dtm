Abstract

Adults’ Mental Number Line

Previous work has suggested that an important tool of adult
numeric competence is a “mental number line” that codes
increasing numeric magnitudes spatially and with a
directional bias. Partly because the direction of this bias (leftto-right versus right-to-left) is culture-specific, it has been
assumed that a directionally-biased mental number line is a
late development. Our results, in contrast, suggest that nearly
half of all preschoolers possess a directional magnitude bias
and that those who possess this bias demonstrate competence
in representing large numbers, a competence that is otherwise
lacking in same-aged peers. Further, this directional bias does
not appear to be related to pre-reading abilities, but instead
seems to build on already existing preferences in counting
direction.

Three types of evidence suggest that adults represent
knowledge about numeric values using mental number lines.
The first type of evidence comes from adults’ performance
when comparing numerical magnitude (e.g., Which is more,
5 or 6?), where minimizing the distance in value between
two symbols (5 or 6 vs. 7 or 4) or increasing the value of
the two symbols (8 or 9 vs. 1 or 2) reduces solution times
logarithmically (Göbel, Walsh, & Rushworth, 2001; Moyer
& Landauer, 1967). An important parallel exists in
psychophysics, where reducing the distance in length
between two lines or increasing their individual lengths also
reduces comparison times logarithmically (Johnson, 1939).
These parallel findings of logarithmic decrement in
comparison times suggest that when adults compare
numerals, they automatically simulate the numeric
quantities as linear magnitudes, which increase
logarithmically with numeric value (Banks & Hill, 1974;
Dehaene, 1997). In support of this interpretation, focal
transcranial magnetic stimulation of brain regions involved
in visuospatial search also disrupt performance in
comparing numerosity while sparing performance on other
tasks (Göbel, Walsh, & Rushworth, 2001).
A second type of evidence for adults’ use of mental
number lines is provided by their performance on a parity
task, where subjects are asked whether a given number is
odd or even (Dehaene et al., 1993; Fischer, 2001, 2003).
Although knowledge of numeric magnitude is unnecessary
to solve the task, if knowledge of parity is stored in
semantic memory with the mental number line, Dehaene
and colleagues (1993) reasoned, representation of numerals
on a mental number line might intrude on task performance.
Specifically, they found that when subjects were asked
whether large numbers (e.g., 8 or 9) were even, they
responded most quickly with their right hand, whereas when
they were asked about small numbers (e.g., 1 or 2), they
responded most quickly with their left hand. Interestingly,
the direction of this effect—the “Spatial-Numerical
Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect”—was not
affected by handedness or hemispheric dominance, but by
the direction of writing in the culture of the subjects. When

Development of the Mental Number Line
Numeric competence is a fundamental prerequisite of many
social, economic, and educational activities, and the
importance of its acquisition is reflected in the considerable
resources devoted to teaching children mathematics, to
understanding the mental disorders that inhibit mathematical
understanding, and to identifying the cognitive bases of
mathematical understanding. A number of studies have
indicated that an important tool of numeric competence is a
“mental number line” (Dehaene, et al., 2004). Mental
number lines are representations of numeric quantity in
which numerals (e.g., integers) are associated with physical
magnitudes and are ordered serially along the same
dimension as the increasing physical magnitude. By
mentally mapping a directionally-ordered list of integers
onto a series of increasing linear magnitudes, people appear
to gain proficiency in solving a number of quantitative
tasks, including: (1) determining which of two integers
denote greater magnitude (Göbel, Walsh, & Rushworth,
2001), (2) organizing semantic knowledge about the parity
of numerals (Dehaene et al., 1993; Fischer, 2001), and (3)
translating between numeric symbols and spatial
magnitudes (Siegler & Opfer, 2003).

639

Iranian subjects—who write right-to-left—were tested, the
direction of the association was reversed. These results
support the idea that the semantic representation of number
is associated with a mental number line that is oriented leftto-right in societies that write left-to-right.
A third type of evidence of adults’ use of mental
number lines is provided by their performance on numberline estimation tasks, where adults were given a numeral
and asked to estimate its value by marking its position on an
unmarked line that began with a 0 and ended with a 100 or
1000 (Siegler & Opfer, 2003). Hypothesizing that adults’
understanding of the decimal system would lead them to
represent numeric value in terms of linearly increasing
magnitudes, Siegler and Opfer tested whether adults’
estimates
increased
linearly,
logarithmically,
or
exponentially with increasing numeric value. On both the 0100 and 0-1000 number-line estimation tasks, there was a
linear relation between estimates and numeric value (R2s =
1), with 100% of adults providing more linear than
logarithmic or exponential series of estimates.

parity judgment task typically used to elicit the SNARC
effect presents an extraneous task demand on children who
do not yet know the odd-even distinction very well (Miller
& Gelman, 1983), leading researchers to underestimate how
early children possess directionally-biased representations
of increasing magnitude. Furthermore, whether the direction
of the mental number line runs rightward or leftward may
be influenced by the writing system of the society in which
children grow up, but the tendency to develop some
directional bias could emerge well before children show any
sensitivity to this aspect of their writing system.
To test these hypotheses, we presented children with
three numerical tasks: a counting task, in which children
were asked to serially tag the items in a linear array; an
adding task, in which children were asked to add an object
to a linear array; and a subtracting task, in which children
were asked to subtract an object from a linear array.
If participants represent increasing magnitudes as
following a left-to-right or right-to-left orientation, a
consistent pattern of behavior should be evident across all
three tasks. For example, in the counting task, participants
should begin counting from the leftmost end and count
sequentially to the rightmost end; in the adding task,
participants should add objects from left to right; in the
subtracting task, participants should remove objects from
right to left.

Children’s Mental Number Line
Some of the types of evidence indicating adult use of mental
number lines—size and distance effects on numeric
magnitude comparison tasks, the SNARC effect on parity
judgment tasks, and the linearity of estimates on a numberline estimation task—have also been seen in school-aged
children (Berch et al., 1999; Opfer & Siegler, 2005; Sekuler
& Mierkiewicz, 1977; Siegler & Opfer, 2003; Siegler &
Robinson, 1982); however, it is unclear whether still
younger children also possess a mental number line or how
it might develop.
In this paper, we addressed two questions about the
mental number line. First, what is its origin? That is, when
do children—who have not yet learned about numeric
parity—first begin to show evidence of a directional bias in
representing increasing numerical magnitudes? Second,
what numeric competences does it initially serve? To
address these questions, we first examined whether children
showed adult-like directional biases in their adding and
subtracting of elements to a set (Study One). We next
examined whether individual differences in these directional
biases predicted competence in translating the symbolic
code of numbers into numerical quantities (Study Two).

Method
Participants. Participants included 58 English-speaking,
American preschoolers drawn from 3 age groups: 2.5-3.5year-olds (N = 12; M = 3.21, SD = .32; 6 males, 6 females),
3.5-4.5-year-olds (N = 25, M = 3.98, SD = .29; 10 males; 15
females), and 4.5-5.5-year-olds (N = 21, M = 5.18, SD = .47;
13 males, 8 females). Additionally, 22 adults (M = 19.96,
SD = 2.56; 10 males, 12 females) participated as a
comparison group.
Stimuli and Procedure. Participants were presented with
three tasks—counting, adding, and subtracting. In the
counting task, participants were shown a linear array of 9
poker chips, centered on the participants’ midline, and were
asked to count the number of poker chips in the set aloud
and to touch each object that they counted. In the adding
task, participants were presented with a linear array of 3
objects, also centered on the participants’ midline, and
asked to add 1 poker chip to the set “to make it 4”. In the
subtracting task, participants were presented with a linear
array of 4 objects, similarly centered, and asked to take 1
object away from the set “to make it 3 again”. Performance
was videotaped for coding.

Study 1: When Are Representations of
Increasing Magnitude Directionally Biased?
Much of the behavioral evidence in favor of a mental
number line comes from the SNARC effect on the parity
task (Dehaene et al., 1993). Given the strong influence of
participants’ writing system (Dehaene et al., 1993) and the
late emergence of the effect (typically around 3rd grade;
Berch et al., 1999), it seems reasonable to suspect that
children associate large numbers with the right and small
numbers with the left rather late in development, well after
learning to read (Dehaene et al., 1993; Berch et al., 1999;
Fischer, 2001). Another possibility, however, is that the

Results and Discussion
We first analyzed directionality of counting. On our
counting task, 98% of all children and 100% of adults
counted from left to right. This finding is consistent with
previous findings that most 3- to 5-year-olds have a strong
preference for a left-to-right direction in counting, though
640

most realize that a set can be counted in any order (Briars &
Siegler, 1984) Interestingly, in the same research, the
proportion of children who erroneously stated that starting
from an end is an essential element of counting increased
from 10% (of 3-year-olds) to 50% (of 4- and 5-year-olds)
(Briars & Siegler, 1984), an intriguing trend that initially
suggested to us the beginnings of a mental number line.
To examine the issue more directly, we next examined
how children added/subtracted elements to a set (e.g., by
placing the new element above the set, below the set,
to/from the right of the set, or to/from the left of the set). We
were particularly interested in finding participants who both
added from left to right and subtracted from right to left
(“MNL Group” henceforth). As indicated in Figure 1, the
number of participants who fell in this group increased
substantially with age. The average age of all participants in
the MNL group (M = 11.9) was greater than that in the No
MNL group (M = 6.36), t(50) = 3.36, p < .01, even with
adults excluded (MNL, M = 4.64; No MNL, M = 4.1; t(30)
= 2.27, p < .05). This finding is remarkable in that the
spatial-numeric association appeared much earlier than in
other studies (e.g., Berch et al., 1999) with the majority of
change appearing long before children had any experience
reading, which had been the presumed source of this
association.

No MNL group. This difference in performance was
expected to increase with increasing numeric value (e.g., to
be greatest for numerosities greater than 4, where children
could not represent quantities using subitization). For lesser
numerosities, all children were expected to perform at
ceiling.

Method
Participants. Participants were the same preschoolers who
participated in Study One.
Stimuli and Procedure. For the object-set matching tasks,
participants were shown a linear array of white poker chips
arranged on a strip of black poster board (all numerosities 19). Children were provided with a pile of twenty-five white
poker chips to use in the object-set matching tasks.
Procedure. All groups were given four tasks: two integer
matching tasks--Numerals to Numerals (NN) and Numerals
to Chips (NC), and two object-set matching tasks-- Chips to
Numerals (CN), and Chips to Chips (CC). In each case they
were asked to match one kind of numeric magnitude with
either the same kind of numeric magnitude or another kind.
For each task, children were asked to match to all
numerosities 1 - 9. The four tasks were randomized as were
the presentation of numerosities within each task. All
experimental sessions were videotaped for later coding.
On the integer matching tasks, children were asked,
“How many is four?” and the child was to give the
experimenter four poker chips from their pile of twenty-five
poker chips (NC) or to say ‘four’ (NN). On the object-set
matching tasks, children were asked, “How many is this
(experimenter shows the child four poker chips)?” and the
child was asked to say ‘four’ (CN) or to give the
experimenter four poker chips (CC) from their pile of
twenty-five poker chips. This matching paradigm has been
used successfully in prior studies to explore children’s
representations of integers (the counting and “give-anumber tasks” used by Wynn, 1990) and object sets (the
“matching task” used by Huttenlocher, Jordan, & Levine,
1994).

Results and Discussion
We first examined performance on the NN and CC tasks to
ensure that the MNL and No MNL groups were equally
capable of attending to and encoding the numerals and set
sizes that we presented in the NC and CN tasks. To do so,
we regressed children’s answers against the actual number
provided. As expected, both groups did very well. On the
NN task, the R2 of the linear function was nearly 1.00 for
numerosities 1-4 and 5-9 (MNL: 1-4, R2 = .998, 5-9, R2 =
.971; No MNL: 1-4, R2 = .999, 5-9, R2 = .941). On the CC
task, the R2 of the linear function was also nearly 1.00 for
numerosities 1-4 and 5-9 (MNL: 1-4, R2 = .998, 5-9, R2 =
.971; No MNL: 1-4, R2 = .999, 5-9, R2 = .941).
We next examined performance on the NC and CN
tasks, which require children to map a symbolic to a nonsymbolic numerosity. On the CN task, where children could

Study 2: How Are Spatial-Numeric
Associations Related to Numeric Competence?
If directional biases in adding and subtracting were a feature
of mental number lines, we would expect children with
these biases to have a better understanding of the relation
between numeric symbols and linearly-increasing physical
quantities than children who do not possess these biases. To
test this hypothesis, we presented children with four tasks in
which they had to translate between numeric symbols and
physical quantities. The main prediction was that children in
the MNL group would be more likely to provide a correct
physical quantity for a verbal numeral than children in the
641

simply recite the integer list while tagging each chip and
provide the last numeral as the value of the set, both the
MNL and No MNL groups did equally well. The R2 of the
linear function was again nearly 1.00 for numerosities 1-4
and 5-9 (MNL: 1-4, R2 = 1, 5-9, R2 = .991; No MNL: 1-4,
R2 = .995, 5-9, R2 = .987). This performance suggests either
that children in both groups understood the numerals they
provided to denote the cardinal value of the set or that the
children simply used a “last word rule” (Fuson, 1988), but
did not actually represent the cardinal value of the numerals.
To test this, we examined performance on the NC task,
where children were given a numeral and asked to provide
that number of objects. If children used numerals to
represent cardinal value (as implied by a mental number
line), performance on the NC task should be as good as
performance on the CN task for the MNL group but not the
No MNL group. As hypothesized the MNL and No MNL
groups differed dramatically (see Figures 2 and 3). For the
MNL group, the R2 of the linear function was again nearly
1.00 for numerosities 1-4 and 5-9 (1-4, R2 = .965, 5-9, R2 =
.948). In contrast, for the No MNL group, the R2 value for
numerosities 1-4 was 1.00, whereas for larger numerosities
(5-9), R2 = .419.

One possible (albeit uninteresting) reason for the
difference between the two groups’ performance would be
that some number of outliers adversely affected the R2
values of the No MNL group. To ensure that this was not
the case, we next fit linear regression models to each
individual subject and performed an ANOVA to compare
the mean R2 values as a function of numeric range given (14 vs. 5-9) and MNL status (MNL vs. No MNL). As
expected, there was a strong interaction between numeric
range and MNL status, F (1, 56) = 9.62, p < .005 (see Figure
4).
The finding that small numerals are better represented
than large numerals is consistent with previous claims that
children possess at least two different systems for
representing numerical quantity—an “object file” system
that provides young children with a direct, linear mapping
between small numerals (1-4) and small set sizes, and

another system that provides older children with an analog
mapping between larger numerals (5-9) and larger set sizes
(Feigenson, Dehaene, & Spelke, 2004).
Subsequent analyses, however, tend to militate against the
hypothesis that children initially use two different systems
for representing the meaning of small versus large numerals.
Rather than observing a break in the response patterns for 14 versus 5-9, we found that children’s accuracy was better
and more parsimoniously described as a single function
between numeric value and accuracy. For children the in the
No MNL group, for example, accuracy decreased
exponentially with numeric value (R2 = .95), whereas the fit
of the two linear functions was poorer for both small (R2 =
.89) and large numbers (R2 = .77) (see Figure 5).
This overall pattern of errors is consistent with previous
reports (Gallistel & Gleman, 2000; Dehaene, 2003) that
children’s numeric representations become exponentially
less discriminable with increasing numeric value,
suggesting either (1) that the quantities represented by
children increase linearly with numeric value but become
more variable (Gallistel & Gelman, 2000) or (2) that the
quantities represented increase logarithmically with constant
variability (Dehaene, 2003). By inspection, our results seem
to favor the Gallistel and Gelman (2000) model: the larger
the number of chips requested, the more variable the
responses (Figure 4). Two additional analyses, however,
favor the logarithmic scaling account. First, the variability
in responses did not assume a Gaussian distribution around
a linearly increasing median. Rather, around each correct
(modal) response, the distribution of estimates was
asymmetric, with the ratio of under- to over-estimates
increasing with numeric value, r(9) = .88, F = 25.19, p <
.005, as one would expect if subjective magnitude increases
logarithmically with objective magnitude and the variability
around each subjective magnitude is fixed. Second, the
actual median number of chips provided did not increase
linearly. Rather, the number of chips provided increased

logarithmically with the number of chips requested (log R2
= .91), and the logarithmic function accounted for more
variance than even the two linear functions combined (lin
R2s = 1.0 for 1 - 4 and .42 for 5 - 9).
Intriguingly, the same analyses performed for the MNL
group indicated a representation in which magnitude
increased linearly with increasing numeric value, with the
distribution of errors assuming a Gaussian pattern (see
Figure 6). That is, the ratio of under- to over-estimates did
not covary with numeric value, r(7) = .50, ns, and (more
importantly) the number of chips provided increased
linearly with the number of chips requested (lin R2 = .98).
In sum, we found that individual differences in spatialnumeric associations mirrored prior findings of age
differences in numeric representation (e.g., Wynn, 1990;
Siegler & Opfer, 2003). First, paralleling the developmental
finding in Wynn (1990), children in the MNL group
provided more accurate estimates of large numbers than did
children in the No MNL group. Second, subsequent analyses
indicated that much of the inaccuracy in the estimates of
children in the No MNL group came from their use of a
logarithmic representation of number, whereas children’s
errors in the MNL group came from random noise
distributed around an accurate midpoint. These findings of a
logarithmic versus linear representation of number also
parallel the developmental findings of Siegler and Opfer
(2003), who observed a similar transition for estimates of
the values 0-1000.

General Discussion

Across two experiments we examined the development
of directional biases in the representation of numeric
magnitude (e.g., representing numerical magnitudes as
increasing in a left-to-right direction). Although previous
work had indicated that this directional bias originated in
reading practices (Dehaene et al., 1993), our results
indicated that this “mental number line” develops before
children learn to read and before they show any awareness

that symbols are decoded in a left-to-right orientation.
Specifically, we found that (1) the consistency of counting
and adding in a left-to-right manner and subtracting in a
right-to-left manner increased with age (from 17% of 2.5- to
3.5-year-olds to 68% of adults) and (2) the majority of
developmental change in this bias (58%) occurred between
the ages of 3.5- to 5.5- years, well before children typically
learn to read.
To test the hypothesis that this directional bias indicated
a “mental number line” by which children could estimate
the quantities associated with symbolic numerals, we asked
the same children participating in Experiment 1 to translate
between numeric symbols and physical quantities. As
expected, all children performed nearly perfectly for the
lesser numerosities (1-4) in the NC task, indicating that the
task could be understood by all children. For numerosities
outside the subitizing range, however, children with
consistent directional biases greatly outperformed children
who did not have consistent directional biases, even with
age controlled.
Taken together, results suggest that one source of
developmental change in estimation may be the
development of spatial-numeric associations, which could
allow for the excellent discrimination of numeric values
seen in the MNL group and older children. In other studies,
for example, well-discriminated concepts (like good versus
bad) are often associated with spatial dimensions (Lakoff &
Johnson, 1980), and it may be that abstract concepts are
generally represented spatially (Boroditsky, 2000). In the
current case, of course, our proposal is based only on
correlational data, and it remains possible that spatialnumeric associations develop from improvements in
numeric discrimination or even that some third factor (e.g.,
maturation, intelligence, or experience) accounts for the
covariation observed. Further evidence is needed to test the
direction of causation.
