influences reaction times for sentence comprehension and has
demonstrated that pragmatic processing is extremely rapid,
often beginning before phrasal completion (Frisson &
Pickering, 1999; Sedivy, Tanenhaus, Chambers, & Carlson,
1999). However, these studies leave open the question of
whether the pragmatic interpretation is ever preceded by
some degree of semantic interpretation, as most linguistic
theories would predict.
In order to reconcile these seemingly contradicting
accounts, it is necessary to isolate semantic versus pragmatic
meaning in situations where the procedural mechanism is
well understood. Here, one domain that may serve as an
effective test case for many of these issues is the
interpretation of scalar quantifiers. Linguists have long noted
that terms like some have two distinct interpretations (Horn,
1989; Gadzar, 1979). Typically, a sentence like (1) will be
taken to imply that Henry ate some, but not all, of the ice
cream (the upper-bounded reading).
(1)
Henry: I ate some of the ice cream.
However, on occasion some can be used in a context that does
not exclude the total set. Thus (1) differs from the lowerbounded reading in (2) where Karl asserts that Leif ate both
some and all of the lutefisk.1
(2)
Eva: Did anyone eat some of the lutefisk?
Karl: Yeah, Leif ate some. In fact, he ate all of it.
Gricean theorists have argued that weak scalars like some are
semantically compatible with stronger terms like all as in (2).
Interpretations that exclude the stronger scalar as in (1)
require a pragmatic inference called a scalar implicature.
The fact that scalar quantifiers can be interpreted in both of
these ways creates an ideal situation for an account of
semantic and pragmatic processing. Here is a case where the
meaning assigned at each level of interpretation corresponds
to different quantities within an array. At the semantic level,
the lexical meaning of some is compatible with the total
quantity within a given set (SOME AND POSSIBLY ALL) while at
the pragmatic level, some is interpreted to exclude the total
set (SOME BUT NOT ALL). Research on adult and children’s
interpretation of scalar terms seems to provide support for the
existence of these dual interpretations. However, while adults
consistently favor the upper-bounded readings, children
prefer the lower-bounded interpretations for a variety of

Abstract
The relationship between semantic and pragmatic interpretation
has been a perennial puzzle in psycholinguistics. General
agreement about the existence of these levels of interpretation
contrasts with controversy in the field over exact boundaries
between these representations and their relationship in real-time
processing. Past research has demonstrated that pragmatic
processing is rapid, often beginning before phrasal completion
(Frisson & Pickering, 1999; Sedivy et al., 1999). However, they
leave open the question of whether the pragmatic interpretation is
preceded by some degree of semantic interpretation, as most
linguistic theories would predict. These current experiments
address this question by examining a relatively well-understood
test case from linguistics. Horn (1989) noted that scalar
quantifiers like some have two distinct readings corresponding to
lexical semantics (SOME AND POSSIBLY ALL) and pragmatic
inference (SOME BUT NOT ALL). A visual world task was used to
track the online interpretation of some, all, two and three in adults
and five-year-olds. The context provided two potential referents
for the quantified noun phrase (e.g., a girl with 2 of 4 socks and
one with 3 of 3 soccer balls). For all, two and three the reference
of the quantified noun phrase was disambiguated by the semantics
of the quantifier and participants were able to converge on the
target shortly after quantifier onset. For some, however,
determining the referent required a pragmatic implicature. On
these trials looks to the target were substantially delayed,
demonstrating a lag between semantic processing and the
calculation of the implicature. Nevertheless, adults showed a
preference for the target prior to phrasal completion,
demonstrating that scalar inferences can occur as an utterance
unfolds. Children, however, failed to calculate the implicature,
converging on the target only after instructions were completed.

Introduction
Over the history of psycholinguistics, questions concerning
the semantic-pragmatic interface have generated many
experimental studies and theoretical accounts of the language
processing. While many aspects of utterances are tightly
linked to word meaning and syntactic structure, other facets
are clearly added by context-sensitive, inferential
interpretative processes. The fact that utterances are
interpreted at both a semantic and pragmatic level has lead
many to question how these meanings are integrated over the
course of real-time processing. Past research has generally
pursued these issues by exploring how contextual information

measure that is tightly linked to interpretation. Second,
measuring eye movements over the course of comprehension
permits a dynamic look at how interpretations unfolds prior to
the influence of any overt strategic judgments.
In the following experiments, we investigated how
processing of scalar terms unfold over the course of on-line
speech comprehension. We presented participants with visual
displays containing items belonging to two girls—one with
SOME-BUT-NOT-ALL of the socks and another with ALL of the
soccer balls—and recorded their eye-movements when asked
to “Point to the girl that has some of the socks.” These
critical trials contained a period of semantic ambiguity at the
onset of the quantifier where the referent of a lower-bounded
reading of some is compatible with both characters (i.e.
“…some of the soc-”). Resolution of the target compared to
control trials containing quantifiers with lexically encoded
upper-bounds, i.e. a strong scalar term (all) and number
words (two/three). Since these terms do not require a
pragmatic inference to specify exact quantities, these control
trials do not have the same temporary semantic ambiguity as
some.2
If semantic meaning is processed prior to pragmatic
inferences, we would predict quick resolution of the target
character in two, three, and all trials but slower resolution in
some trials. In addition, if pragmatic implicatures occur
rapidly during on-line speech comprehension, we would
predict that resolution of the target character would occur
prior to the completion of the phrase when the referent is
lexically disambiguated (i.e. “…-ks”).

scalar terms. For example, Noveck (2001) asked children and
adults to evaluate statements like “x might be y” in contexts
where “x must be y” was true. He found that while adults
overwhelmingly rejected the weaker modal, 7- to 9-year-olds
treated the statement to be logically compatible with the
stronger statement. Similarly, Papafragou and Musolino
(2003) found that five-year-olds, but not adults, were content
to accept weak scalar predicates like started in situations
where the stronger scalar term applied (i.e. finished).
All together these studies demonstrate that while scalar
implicatures characterizes default interpretations among
adults, they occur far less reliably among children, who are
less pragmatically sophisticated. These results suggest that
when children initially acquire scalar terms, their
interpretations solely reflect the semantic content. Only later
do they develop sensitivity to the pragmatic inference
necessary to generate a scalar implicature. Here is a case
where the theoretical distinction between semantic and
pragmatic aspects of meaning plays itself out in the
observable behavior of different populations. This relation
can also be explored by investigating how these
interpretations arise in the course of real-time processing.
That is, how are semantic and pragmatic representations
integrated over the course of comprehension?
In order to address this question, recent studies have sought
to understand generation of scalar implicatures using
measures of reaction time (see also Katsos et al, 2005). Bott
and Noveck (2004) compared reaction time of truth-value
judgments of underinformative statements like “Some
elephants are mammals.” They found that participants who
spontaneously adopted an implicature interpretation (i.e.
judged the statement to be false) took longer than participants
who adopted a lower-bounded interpretation (i.e. judged the
statement to be true). However, there are many limitations to
the generality of these results. First, since these procedures
required participants to make overt truth judgments on written
sentences, they might induce a more strategic processing than
normal conversational discourse. Second, measures of
sentence final reaction times are opaque to the underlying
stages of processing. These delays could reflect the overall
difficulty of judging false statements without specifically
attributing them to the generation of scalar implicatures.
Recent research finding no differences in RT when these
interpretations were compared within-participants support
these possibilities (Feeney et al., 2004).
One way to circumvent these problems is to use a
procedure that could obtain an indirect measure of
comprehension during the time-course of interpretation. The
visual-world eye-tracking paradigm has been used
extensively in psycholinguistic research to yield a sensitive,
time-locked measure of linguistic processing (Eberhard et al.,
1995). Participants are presented with spoken instructions,
asking them to manipulate objects within a visual reference
world, while their eye-movements to those objects are
measured. This procedure has at least two advantages for
exploring semantic and pragmatic interpretations. First, it
allows spoken language to be used and provides a dependent

Methods
Subjects Twenty students at Harvard University took part
and received course credit for their participation. All students
were native monolingual English speakers.
Procedure Participants sat in front of an inclined podium
divided into four quadrants, each containing a shelf where
pictures could be placed (i.e. upper left, upper right, lower
left, and lower right). A camera at the center of the display
recorded their face during the task. For each trial, the
experimenter would place unlabeled characters on each shelf
and then act out a scripted story where different objects were
distributed among these four characters. Next participants
heard prerecorded commands instructing them to select one
of the characters (e.g. “Point to the girl with some of the
socks”). Their selection was recorded by a second camera
located behind them.
Materials Participants received 16 randomized trials that
varied across two factors. Quantifier type contrasted true
scalars with number words across two levels of informational
strength. Weak quantifiers (e.g. two and some) referred to
2

The semantics of number words has been an area of contention
within theoretical linguistics. While some have claimed that
numbers pattern like other lower-bounded scalars (Horn, 1989;
Gadzar, 1979; Levinson, 2000), most of them have since revised.
See Huang et al. (submitted) for more discussion of this debate.

terms that were logically compatible with stronger members
of their respective scales (e.g. three and all). Each trial
contained four types of cards (see figure 1): (1) Targets
matched both gender and object cues (e.g. girl with socks),
(2) Gender Distracters matched gender but not object cues
(e.g. girl with soccer balls), (3) Object Distracters matched
item but not object cues (e.g. boy with socks), and (4)
Irrelevant Distracters matched neither cues (e.g. boy with
soccer balls). Targets were arranged horizontally adjacent to
Object Distracter and vertically adjacent to Gender
Distracters. Two sets of objects were distributed among
horizontal pairs in a TWO/TWO and ZERO/THREE configuration
for scalar trials and a TWO/TWO and ONE/THREE configuration
for number trials.3 Finally, presentation of materials was
counterbalanced by creating four lists such that each list
contained four items in each condition and each item was
rotated through the four conditions.

Trueswell, 2004).

Results
We examined the proportion of subjects’ eye-movements
towards the target character over two divisions of time. Our
first analysis examined a coarse-grain measure of subjects’
use of the quantifier during five periods of analysis:

TIME TO CARD SELECTION

All time windows began and ended 200 ms after the relevant
marker in the speech stream to account for the time it would
take to program saccadic eye-movements (Eberhard et al.,
1995). For each trial, we summed the total number of looks
to the target character and gender distracter within each of
these intervals and calculated the proportion of looks to the
target over looks to both. This score ranged from zero
(exclusive looks to the gender distracter) to one (exclusive
looks to the target character). Looks to the Object and
Irrelevant Distracters were infrequent after onset of the
gender cue and were not included in the analysis. Each time
window was analyzed with ANOVAs of quantifier type
(number vs. scalar), quantifier strength (weak vs. strong).
List/item group were manipulated between subjects and
between items
During the BASELINE PHASE, the proportion of looks to the
target character initially remained around chance across all
terms (see figure 2). There was no main effect of quantifier
type (F1(1, 16) = 1.30, p > .10; F2(1, 15) = 0.75, p > .10),
quantifier strength (F1(1, 16) = 3.13, p > .05; F2(1, 15) = 2.00,
p > .10), or interaction (F1(1, 16) = 4.14, p > .05; F2(1, 15) =
3.31, p > .05). This continued through the following GENDER
PHASE, where again there was no main effect of quantifier
type (F1(1, 16) = 1.52, p > .10; F2(1, 15) = 1.55, p > .10),
quantifier strength (F1(1, 16) = 4.33, p > .05; F2(1, 15) = 4.13,
p > .05), or interaction (F1(1, 16) = 0.01, p > .10; F2(1, 15) =
0.01, p > .10).
However during the QUANTIFIER PHASE, fixations to the
Target Object increased when participants heard two (66%),
three (72%), and all (72%) but not when they heard some
(45%), see Figure 3. During this period, there were main
effects of quantifier type (F1(1, 16) = 5.16, p < .05; F2(1, 15)
= 6.39, p < .05) and quantifier strength (F1(1, 16) = 16.86, p <
.01; F2(1, 15) = 18.29, p < .01), and also critically a
significant interaction between both variables (F1(1, 16) =
6.58, p < .05; F2(1, 15) = 5.25, p < .05). This quickly
disappeared by the DISAMBIGUATION PHRASE where there
was a main effect of quantifier strength (F1(1, 16) = 15.65, p
< .01; F2(1, 15) = 23.66, p < .01) but not quantifier type (F1(1,

Figure 1: Visual display for some trials.
Coding Trained research assistants coded videotapes of the
participant’s actions and eye movements. Each recorded trial
began at the onset of these instructions and ended with
completion of the corresponding actions. Eye movements
were coded by a research assistant who was blind to the
location of each object using frame-by-frame viewing of the
participant’s face on SONY digital videotapes. Each change
in direction of gaze was coded as towards one of the
quadrants, at the center, or missing due to looks away from
the display or blinking. These missing frames were excluded
from analysis; however they only accounted for
approximately 3% of all coded frames. This method of eyetracking has been validated with high inter-coder reliability
and significantly correlates with data obtained from previous

An earlier version of this experiment held constant the set of
objects across all trial types. While this resulted in similar overall
effects, it also produced a slight delay in the disambiguation of three.
This occurred because the partitive construction of count phrases
necessarily picks out a set from within a larger array (i.e. “three of
the socks”). While the configuration for two trials naturally supports
this construction, we fulfilled it for three trials by adding an extra

opposite gender, it did not directly affect looks to the target during
critical periods.

(F1(1, 16) = 0.73, p > .10; F2(1, 15) = 0.63, p > .10). Finally,
during the END PHASE, total fixations closed in unsurprisingly
on the target leading to no differences across type (F1(1, 16) =
0.24, p > .10; F2(1, 15) = 0.07, p > .10), strength (F1(1, 16) =
0.78, p > .10; F2(1, 15) = 0.48, p > .10), or interaction (F1(1,
16) = 0.32, p > .10; F2(1, 15) = 0.29, p > .10).

Discussion
We found that adults were able to integrate semantic and
pragmatic interpretations of quantifiers over the course of
real-time speech comprehension. However, the speed at
which they did so were greatly affected by the term they
heard and in particular, we found a reliable preference for the
target during the QUANTIFIER PHASE for two, three, and all
trials but a delay for the some trials. This suggests that the
referent is rapidly disambiguated when the upper-boundary of
the term is semantically specified. In the case of a weak
scalar quantifier, the lower-bounded semantics initially left
the referent ambiguous. However, later in the ambiguous
period, the preference for the target on the some trials was
reliably above chance. This indicates that participants were
not relying solely on the disambiguation from the final
phoneme to find the target but were in fact arriving at an
upper-bounded interpretation by generating the scalar
implicature during the course of real-time processing.
In Experiment 2, we investigated early semantic and
pragmatic processing by performing a parallel experiment on
children. Recent research on the development of on-line
comprehension has taken advantage of the eye-tracking
paradigm’s ability to provide an implicit measure of
children’s interpretation rather than requiring explicit
judgments over utterances. If children’s acquisition of words
and structures are initially guided by the understanding of
speaker’s intent (Tomasello, 1998), we might expect that they
would be more inclined to interpret words pragmatically or
might initially misinterpret the upper-bound as part of the
word’s meaning. In contrast, studies using explicit judgment
tasks suggest that children are more literal than adults
(Noveck, 2001; Papafragou & Musolino, 2003).

Additional analyses of 200 ms intervals confirm the
differences in time it took subjects to reliably fixate on the
target character across the four terms. Approximately 400
ms following the onset of the quantifier, the proportion of
looks to the target on the two, three, and all trials were
significantly greater than chance, t(19) = 4.77, p < .001; t(19)

We found that children, like adults, demonstrated earlier
disambiguation for two, three, and all and a later
disambiguation for some. The fact that lexically upperbounded quantifiers patterned differently from a
pragmatically specified one suggests that children, like adults,
privilege initial semantic analysis of utterances. However,
relative to adults, looks to the target occurred at a later time
window and likely reflects children’s difficulty in overcoming
initial bias to fixate on cards with greater quantities. All
together, these results suggest that children, perhaps more so
than adults, rely heavily on the logical meaning when
interpreting utterances (Noveck, 2001; Papafragou &
Musolino, 2003). Further investigation will be needed to
explore whether children ever perform these pragmatic
inferences over the course of real-time speech
comprehension.

Finally, during the DISAMBIGUATION PHRASE, fixations to
the Target Object increased for two (60%), three (73%), and

This resulted in a main effects of quantifier type (F1(1, 20) =

(F1(1, 20) = 28.64, p < .01; F2(1, 15) = 21.79, p < .001), and
also critically a significant interaction between both variables
(F1(1, 20) = 10.33, p < .01; F2(1, 15) = 3.89, p > .05). This
quickly disappeared by the END PHASE where total fixations
closed in on the target leading to no differences across type
(F1(1, 20) = 1.74, p > .10; F2(1, 15) = 2.15, p > .10), strength
(F1(1, 20) = 3.08, p > .05; F2(1, 15) = 6.38, p < .05), or
interaction (F1(1, 20) = 0.60, p > .10; F2(1, 15) = 0.40, p >

Additional analyses confirm that approximately 800 ms
following the onset of the quantifier, differential fixations
across terms led to a significant quantifier type by strength
interaction (F(1, 20) = 11.30, p < .01). During this period,
there were also main effects of quantifier type (F(1, 20) =
8.00, p < .01) and strength (F1(1, 20) = 34.08, p < .001).

General Discussion
This study explores the real-time interaction between
semantic and pragmatic meaning by investigating
interpretations of scalar terms. In Experiment 1 and 2, we
found that semantic meaning is activated prior to inferential
procedures but that these pragmatic inferences occur quickly
over the course of on-line speech comprehension. These
findings add to a growing literature demonstrating delays of
pragmatic interpretations of scalar quantifiers relative to
semantic ones (Bott & Noveck, 2004; Katsos, et al., 2005).
However, we extend this work by demonstrating that
information provided by distinct systems (as defined by work
in theoretical linguistics) becomes available at different times
during processing.
There is an apparent tension between our results and
previous findings demonstrating rapid assimilation of extralinguistic cues. Sedivy et al. (1999) demonstrated that
participants who heard “Pick up the tall cup” identified the
correct target faster in the presence of an adjectival contrast
(e.g. short cup), suggesting that incremental semantic
interpretations make almost immediate use of contextual

355

information. Our results suggest that despite the speed at
which this occurs, pragmatic interpretation is preceded by
some degree of semantic interpretation. Ultimately, both
studies are consistent with a model of language that is
characterized by representational modularity in a massively
interactive system (Trueswell & Tanenhaus, 1994).
Consequently, while processing at one level does not need to
be completed before processing at the next level begins, the
fact that semantic representations mediate between
phonological form and pragmatic interpretation, requires that
they have some priority during interpretation.
Finally, our data also bear upon the current debates in
linguistic theory on the mechanisms underlying generation of
pragmatics interpretations (Bott & Noveck, 2004; Katsos et
al., 2005; Feeney et al., 2004). One hypothesis is that
pragmatic interpretations, like scalar implicatures, generally
occur by default unless otherwise cancelled by the context
(Levinson, 2000). Others argue that all pragmatic
interpretations, including implicatures, are constructed with
reference to the global situation, rejecting notions of default
inferences (Sperber & Wilson, 1986). While our study was
not specifically designed to distinguish these two accounts,
features of our data are compatible with predictions that each
might make about language processing. The quickness of
scalar implicatures in adults suggests that these inferences
may selectively attend to particular informational sources
(e.g. linguistic/visual context). Nonetheless, the reliable
delay suggests that the automatcity of even the most robust of
pragmatic inferences requires some initial processing of
lexical semantics.
In conclusion, the results of our study indicate the clear
distinction between procedures associated with the
interpretation of semantic and pragmatic meaning. Using the
visual-world eye tracking, we found that listeners quickly
restricted interpretations to the correct referent when
utterances involved semantically unambiguous terms.
However, when presented with a lexically lower-bounded
quantifier like some, participants’ initial interpretations failed
to differentiate between quantities that include (POSSIBLY
ALL) and exclude the total set (NOT ALL). However, we also
found that adults in these cases quickly generated pragmatic
implicatures prior to the phonological disambiguation at the
completion of the phrase. All together these results provide
evidence for a model of real-time processing where semantics
of quantifiers are activated prior to inferential procedures but
that these pragmatic inferences occur quickly over the course
of real-time speech comprehension.
