Weber and Cutler (2004) tested a group of Dutch-English
bilinguals in both Dutch and English, and found coactivation of the non-target language when it was the L1,
but not when it was the L2. One explanation for this
discrepancy lies in the different levels of second-language
proficiency and experience across the two participant
groups, with higher L2 proficiency levels in the RussianEnglish bilinguals (tested in the US) than in the DutchEnglish bilinguals (tested in the Netherlands). Another
possible explanation for the observed differences in L2
activation across studies lies in the degree to which L2
phonetic characteristics match those of L1. For instance, in
another eye-tracking study with Spanish-English bilinguals,
Ju and Luce (2004) demonstrated that participants fixated
interlingual distractors more frequently than control
distractors when voice onset times in Spanish auditory
stimuli matched the voice onset times appropriate for
English. Consistently, Blumenfeld and Marian (2005)
found that when degree of phonetic overlap at word onset is
increased, co-activation of L2 increases, but only in
cognates. Thus, co-activation of L2 may be amplified by
matching L1 and L2 phonetic characteristics. Furthermore,
manipulating degree of phonological overlap across
languages may produce different levels of non-target
language co-activation.
Different patterns of activation observed for L1 and L2
suggest that cross-talk between languages may vary for first
and second language processing. This may be the case
because proficiency is usually greater in the first language
than in the second language, or as a result of differences in
age of acquisition and history of language use (e.g., Zevin &
Seidenberg, 2002; Jared & Kroll, 2001; Grosjean, 1997).
For example, monolingual interlocutors and language
settings influence a bilingual’s language choice by
increasing the use of one language and decreasing its
threshold of activation. As a result, the language used more
frequently long-term may become dominant and more
readily available for processing, and this variability in
individual history of language use may contribute to
bilinguals’ asymmetry in word recognition across
languages.
The dynamic nature of bilingual lexical representations is
captured in Kroll and Stewart’s (1994) Revised Hierarchical
Model (RHM). According to the RHM, bilinguals’
proficiency influences first and second language processing

Abstract
The role of cross-linguistic phonological overlap in native and
non-native word recognition was examined using an auditory
lexical decision task. The degree of phonological overlap across
languages was manipulated. Cross-linguistic overlap facilitated
word recognition in the non-native language, but inhibited word
recognition in the native language. The observed facilitation and
inhibition effects provide evidence for a parallel account of
bilingual word recognition and suggest an asymmetry in native
and non-native phonological processing.

Introduction
Modern accounts of bilingual lexical representation and
processing suggest that the two lexica of a bilingual are
intergraded. Parallel activation of target (language of the
task) and non-target (irrelevant to the task) languages is
supported by empirical data from both the auditory (e.g.,
Blumenfeld & Marian, 2005; Marian & Spivey, 2003a, b;
Spivey & Marian, 1999; Van Wijnendaele & Brysbaert,
2002) and the visual modalities (e.g., Costa, Miozzo, &
Caramazza, 1999; Hermans, Bongaerts, De Bot, &
Schreuder, 1998; Van Heuven, Dijkstra, & Grainger, 1998),
as well as by simulations of cross-language competition
(e.g., Dijkstra, van Heuven, & Grainger, 1998). The degree
of activation of the non-target lexicon may vary as a
function of language dominance and other factors (e.g.,
modality of presentation, similarity of sensory input in the
target language to phonology or orthography of the nontarget language, etc).
Parallel activation has been shown to occur more reliably
with high-proficiency non-target languages than with lowproficiency non-target languages (Jared & Kroll, 2001;
Silverberg & Samuel, 2004; Van Hell & Dijkstra, 2002;
Weber & Cutler, 2004). For example, while findings of
parallel first-language (L1) activation during secondlanguage (L2) processing have been consistent (Blumenfeld
& Marian, 2005, Marian & Spivey, 2003a, b; Weber &
Cutler, 2004), findings of parallel L2 activation during L1
processing have been mixed (Ju & Luce, 2004; Marian &
Spivey, 2003b; Weber & Cutler, 2004). Using eye-tracking,
Marian and Spivey (2003a) tested a group of RussianEnglish bilinguals when Russian was the non-target
language and when English was the non-target language.
They found co-activation of the non-target language, both
when it was the L1 and when it was the L2. In contrast,

and underlying representational mechanisms. During initial
stages of second language acquisition, L2 words are
connected to L1 words via lexical links, and L1 words are in
turn connected to semantic information. As bilinguals
continue to learn the second language and their proficiency
level increases, L2 words begin to form direct links to
conceptual representations. At later stages of acquisition, L2
words have established connections with conceptual
information, but the links between L2 and L1 at the lexical
level are preserved and may be relied upon when processing
in a highly-proficient second language. The RHM proposes
that the strength of various connections is not the same, with
conceptual representations linked more strongly to L1
lexical representations than to L2 lexical representation. At
the lexical level, the path from L2 to L1 is stronger than the
path from L1 to L2. Connections of different strength
suggest an asymmetry in bilingual lexical organization and
processing.
While the exact nature of the asymmetry between L1 and
L2 phonological processing remains unclear, one possible
explanation relies on bilinguals’ lack of fine-grained
distinctions in non-native phonological representations.
Research with non-native listeners suggests that auditory
word recognition is more difficult in the second language
than in the first language (e.g., Bradlow & Bent, 2002). The
ease of phonological processing may vary with proficiency,
similarly to lexical processing (Kroll & Stewart, 1994).
Initially, L1 phonological representations may be organized
as tightly constrained categories of sounds and include
phonological representations for similar L2 categories. For
instance, Best and colleagues (2001) suggested that some L2
phonemes can be perceptually assimilated to L1 phonetic
categories, based on commonalities in the organs of
articulation, and the place and manner of articulation.
Empirical evidence supports this account and shows that L2
phonemes similar to a common L1 category are
discriminated with more difficulty than L2 phonemes that
do not bear resemblance to an L1 category (e.g., Best,
McRoberts, & Goodell, 2001). Imai, Walley, and Flege
(2005) proposed that with increased L2 word learning and
exposure, L2 phonological representations become more
fine-grained. In sum, phonological competence in L1 and
L2 may influence the extent of parallel language activation.
One way to test this hypothesis is to examine how bilinguals
process input that varies in degree of cross-linguistic
phonological similarity. If lower phonological competence
in L2 contributes to asymmetry in L1-L2 processing, then
sensitivity to cross-linguistic phonological similarity should
differ across the two languages.
The objective of the present study was to examine the role
of cross-linguistic phonological overlap during L1 and L2
processing in the auditory domain. The study was modeled
after a visual language processing experiment by Jared and
Kroll (2001). Jared and Kroll examined the role of
proficiency and language context on parallel activation of
bilingual lexica. They tested activation of phonological
representations in bilinguals’ two languages when reading

stimuli with overlapping graphemic form. English-French
and French-English bilinguals read aloud words with
varying consistency of grapheme-to-phoneme mapping
across languages. The stimuli were presented in three
phases: an English-words phase, a French-words phase, and
another English-words phase. Results varied depending on
whether bilinguals were processing words in L1 or L2.
French-English bilinguals activated French spelling-tosound correspondences while reading in English, as
indicated by increased error rates and slower naming
latencies for words with French competitors (words with
different letter-to-sound mappings in French, e.g., lait) than
for words with no competitors. During the first English
phase, English-French bilinguals did not activate French
spelling-to-sound correspondences, even if they were fluent
in French. However, in the second English phase after
completing the French phase of the experiment, participants
experienced interference from French spelling-to-sound
correspondences.
Similar to Jared and Kroll (2001), the present study tested
the effect of cross-linguistic overlap on first and second
language processing and examined the role of language
context on parallel activation of bilingual lexica. The design
of the study followed that of Jared and Kroll and included
three language phases. Alternating between languages
across the three phases (second language, followed by first
language, followed by second language) made it possible to
examine the costs of switching language contexts on parallel
language activation. The differences between the two
studies were in (1) the modality of processing, and (2) ways
in which input was varied. While Jared and Kroll targeted
visual word recognition and manipulated spelling-to-sound
consistency, the present study targeted auditory word
recognition and manipulated phonological overlap.
Phonological overlap was defined by the presence of
phonemes shared across native and non-native languages.
In order to manipulate phonological overlap, phonemes in
each language were divided into unique and non-unique
(i.e., shared). Uniqueness was established after comparing
corresponding phonemes in L1 and L2 on their
characteristics. While Jared and Kroll (2001) used words
with no competitors, words with competitors in the same
language, and words with competitors in the other language,
the present study used words that did not overlap
phonologically, words that overlapped phonologically for
one-third of auditory input, words that overlapped
phonologically for two-thirds of auditory input, and words
that overlapped phonologically completely. Using four
levels of overlap made it possible to manipulate
phonological similarity in a gradual manner and perform a
more fine-grained analysis of the impact of phonology on
bilingual spoken word recognition. The direction and
consistency of effects across different degrees of overlap
were investigated.
To test the extent to which bilinguals activated
phonological
representations
of
both
languages
simultaneously, Russian-English bilinguals were asked to

102

perform a lexical decision task and to decide whether
auditory input constituted a word or a non-word. It was
hypothesized that if phonological representations of two
languages were co-activated and accessed simultaneously
whenever one of the languages was activated, then response
latencies and accuracy rates for auditory stimuli that
overlapped phonologically across languages would differ
compared to stimuli that did not overlap across languages.
Moreover, the role of phonological overlap was predicted to
vary across first and second languages. Specifically,
overlap with a more proficient language was predicted to
affect performance in a less proficient language more than
overlap with a less proficient language would affect
performance in a more proficient language.

for English. A one-way ANOVA on four subsets of
Russian words revealed no differences in mean frequencies,
F (3, 36) < 1. A 2 x 4 ANOVA (English Set x Phonological
Overlap) for English word frequencies showed no main
effect of English set [F (1, 68) < 1], no main effect of
Phonological Overlap [F (3, 68) = 1.13, p = .34], and no
interaction between the two [F (3, 68) < 1]. In addition,
words in the Russian phase (M = 50.15, SD = 72.87) did not
differ in frequency from words in the first English phase (M
= 59.18, SD = 78.80), t (77) = .53, p = .598, or second
English phase (M = 62.59.15, SD = 90.05), t (75) = .67, p =
.506. English stimuli were recorded by a native speaker of
English in a sound-proof booth. Russian stimuli were
recorded in a similar manner by a native speaker of Russian.

Method
Design and Procedure
Participants

The experiment followed a 3 x 4 x 2 within-subjects design.
The first factor, phase, had three levels: first English phase,
Russian phase, and second English phase. Phonological
overlap included four levels: 0-phoneme overlap, 1phoneme overlap, 2-phoneme overlap, and 3-phoneme
overlap. The third factor, lexical status, had two levels:
word and non-word. Latency of response and response
accuracy were measured.
At the start of an English phase, instructions were
presented in English; at the start of the Russian phase,
instructions were presented in Russian. Participants heard
the stimuli over standard headphones. The first set of
English items was played first; followed by the set of
Russian items and the second set of English items. On each
trial, participants performed a lexical decision task on a
phoneme sequence by pressing either a “word” or “nonword” key on the response box. There was a 1500 ms intertrial interval, and a self-paced break was offered after every
20 trials. Reaction times were measured from stimulus
offset. At the end of the experiment participants completed
a questionnaire about their linguistic background.

Twenty-six Russian-English bilinguals (15 females)
participated in the study. Their mean age at the time of
testing was 22.12 years (SD = 6.26). Participants were
students at an American university and had lived in the US
for an average of 12.65 years (SD = 9.16). They had known
English for an average of 12.75 years (SD = 8.90) and
Russian for an average of 20.17 years (SD = 5.18), paired
samples t (25) = 4.04, p < .001. Participants reported
speaking English on average 7 hours per day (range 0.5-12)
and Russian 3.52 hours a day (range 0.3-7), paired samples t
(25) = 3.68, p < .001. English was the preferred language
for 13 participants; Russian was preferred by 10
participants, while 3 participants reported no language
preference. Participants were naïve to the experimental
manipulation and were paid for their participation.

Materials
The stimuli were three-phoneme Russian and English words
and non-word phoneme-sequences, coded according to the
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA, 1999). All words
were unique to Russian and English and no cognates,
homophones, or homographs were used. Two-hundred-andforty stimuli were divided into three sets: Russian set, first
English set, and second English set. Each set consisted of
40 words and 40 non-words.
In the Russian set, the words were selected so that 10
were comprised of unique Russian phonemes (0-phoneme
overlap), another 10 included two unique and one nonunique Russian phonemes (1-phoneme overlap), a third
subset of 10 contained one unique and two non-unique
phonemes (2-phoneme overlap), and the last 10 consisted of
only non-unique Russian phonemes (3-phoneme overlap).
Corresponding sets of non-word stimuli were constructed in
the same manner using unique and non-unique Russian
phonemes. The words and non-words in the English sets
were selected in the same manner using unique and nonunique English phonemes.
Words were matched for frequency of occurrence within
each language, using Sharoff’s (2003) frequency dictionary

Coding and Analyses
Items with accuracy rates less than 70% across participants
were excluded from analyses, resulting in elimination of
9.2% of word data. In another 0.9% of word data and
3.75% of non-word data, reaction times were greater than
2500 ms and were substituted with 2500 ms, which was
equal to about 2.5 SDs above the mean RT across
participants.

711.25, SD = 246.29), t (25) = 2.95, p < .01, or the second
English phase (M = 698.59, SD = 274.79), t (25) = 2.05, p =
.051, and responded faster to words (M = 499.62, SD =
204.54) than to non-words (M = 846.06, SD = 386.76).
Significant interactions were found between Phase and
Phonological Overlap [F (6, 150) = 4.11, MSE = 12,643.56,
p<.01], between Lexical Status and Phonological Overlap
[F (3, 75) = 3.42, MSE = 15,806.49, p < .05], and between
Phase, Lexical Status and Phonological Overlap [F (6, 150)
= 4.84, MSE = 14,625.08, p<.01].
Follow-up analyses showed a main effect of Phonological
Overlap in the first English phase [F (3, 75) = 3.18, MSE =
10,157.67, p < .05], where increased phonological overlap
was associated with shorter reaction times (although the
relationship was non-linear). Participants responded slower
to words with 0-phoneme overlap (M = 560.43, SD =
239.77) than to words with 1-phoneme overlap (M = 494.47,
SD = 166.93), t (25) = 2.158, p < .05, or to words with 3phoneme overlap (M = 475.50, SD = 159.12), t (25) = 2.61,
p < .05. Similarly, reaction times to words with 2-phoneme
overlap (M = 530.66, SD = 182.28) were slower than to
words with 3-phoneme overlap, t (25) = 2.98, p < .01. In
the second English phase, no main effect of Phonological
Overlap was found. However, planned contrasts showed
that reaction times to words with 0-phoneme overlap (M =
567.82, SD = 261.33) were slower than to words with 2phoneme overlap (M = 477.61, SD = 164.95), t (25) = 2.73,
p < .05. No differences in reaction times to words were
found between the first English phase (M = 515.27, SD =

with 0-phoneme overlap (M = .92, SD = .10), t (25) = 2.05,

In the Russian phase, a main effect of Phonological Overlap
was also observed [F (3, 75) = 3.17, MSE = 16,313.23, p<.05].
However, while participants responded slower to words with
0-phoneme overlap (M = 471.21, SD = 228.68) than to words
with 1-phoneme overlap (M = 392.86, SD = 192.76), t (25) =

The degree of cross-linguistic phonological overlap was
found to influence participants’ response speed and
accuracy. However, different patterns were observed for
L1 and L2 processing. In the second language (English),
greater cross-linguistic phonological overlap was associated
with shorter latencies and greater accuracy of response. The
opposite pattern was observed for the first language
(Russian), where, in general, phonological overlap with L2
was associated with longer latency rates and decreased
accuracy. It is important to note that the patterns of results
observed in the present study may not hold for bilinguals

with a different language-history profile, such as bilinguals
who are balanced across both languages, who acquired both
languages in parallel, or whose L1/L2 proficiencies differ
more drastically.
In both English phases of the present study, words that
shared phonology with Russian were identified faster and
more accurately than words comprised of unique English
phonemes. Moreover, as phonological overlap increased,
responses were provided faster and with more accuracy. The
observed facilitation of the second language as a function of
phonological overlap with the first language is consistent
with previous research reporting facilitation during masked
priming of non-native words with phonologically similar
native words (Brysbaert, Van Dyck, & Van de Poel, 1999).
However, although reaction time and accuracy followed the
same patterns in both English phases, follow-up pair-wise
comparisons suggested that the magnitude of the differences
was greater in the first English phase than in the second
English phase. That is, while in the first English phase, a
graded increase in RT was observed as a function of
phonological overlap, in the second English phase, only
considerable differences such as between unique phonology
and shared phonology affected response latency and
accuracy. It is possible that practice effects and increased
familiarity with the task in the course of the experiment
reduced sensitivity to fine-grained differences in
phonological overlap. Alternatively, the discrepancies
between the two English phases could be attributed to the
change in linguistic context and baseline of activation. In
the Jared and Kroll (2001) study greater interference in
production of words with French competitors was observed
after completion of the French phase. Completing a task in
Russian could introduce greater overall facilitation when
processing English stimuli and attenuate differences in
reaction times to stimuli with various degrees of
phonological overlap.
In the Russian phase, response latency and accuracy were
also affected by degree of phonological overlap. However,
unlike English word recognition, Russian word recognition
appeared to be inhibited by increased phonological overlap
with L2. The finding that lexical decision was slower for
words with 0-phoneme overlap than for words with 1phoneme overlap was inconsistent with the overall pattern.
One possible explanation relies on the speed-accuracy tradeoff, i.e., while reaction times were slower to stimuli with 0phoneme overlap than to stimuli with 1-phoneme overlap,
accuracy was greater for stimuli with 0-phoneme overlap
than for stimuli with 2-phoneme overlap.
Another
possibility is that the English context of the first phase
suppressed access to uniquely Russian phonological
information. Reaction time data reflected this suppression,
while accuracy data did not, possibly due to greater
sensitivity of reaction time to minor changes in linguistic
context. This hypothesis is consistent with previous
research on the effects of phonological similarity in
bilingual naming, where reaction time measures of
processing in a non-native language were more sensitive to

phonological neighborhood effects (Marian & Blumenfeld,
in press). To further test this hypothesis, future research may
vary the order of native and non-native language input, so
that both are presented with and without prior exposure to
the other language. Overall, it appears that lexical decision
in L1 is slowed by interference effects from phonologically
overlapping L2 phonemes.
The facilitation and interference effects observed in the
present study provide evidence for an integrated account of
bilingual
lexical
organization.
Cross-linguistically
overlapping input activated both languages, regardless of
the task-relevant language. In L1, activation of the nonnative language phonology delayed or compromised lexical
decision, possibly due to competition between viable wordform representations as a result of simultaneous activation
of L2. In L2, activation of the native-language phonology
aided processing, perhaps due to faster phoneme recognition
in L1 as a result of extensive previous use. Alternatively, the
facilitation and interference effects could be explained in
terms of order of acquisition, with L1 mediating subsequent
language learning (Best et al., 2001). L1 phonetic categories
acquired early in life are tightly constrained and may
compete with similar L2 phonemes, while L2 phonetic
representations acquired later in life, are organized into wide
categories of sounds and can be co-activated by similar L1
phonemes. Therefore, the observed pattern of results could
be explained by the structure of phonological
representations in L1 and L2. Lexical decision in L1 was
delayed by competition of highly constrained L1 categories
and co-activated L2 phonemes, and lexical decision in L2
was facilitated by co-activation of wider L2 categories with
similar L1 phonemes.
In sum, native-language words that shared phonology
with the second language were processed slower and with
less accuracy than words with unique native phonology.
However, first-language words that were completely unique
in phonological characteristics were also recognized slower,
suggesting a possible influence of linguistic-context on first
language processing. These differences in the direction and
magnitude of the effect were uncovered only because degree
of phonological overlap was systematically manipulated
across four levels. Such graded manipulation of
phonological overlap emerged as a valuable tool for
exploring processing in the bilingual language system.
Studies of language interaction in bilinguals typically use
cognates, homophones, or homographs, which are usually
the exception to bilingual linguistic input rather than the
rule. Non-cognate, non-homophonic/non-homographic
stimuli that are comprised of either overlapping or nonoverlapping phonology, such as the words used in the
present study, provide a window into the more general
system of bilingual organization.
To conclude, both the facilitation and the interference
effects observed in the present study support parallel
accounts of bilingual language processing and integrated
accounts of bilingual lexical organization. However, they
also suggest an asymmetry in first and second language

105

phonological processing in unbalanced bilinguals. This
asymmetry may be accounted for by variability in L1 and
L2 phonological representations, with additional research
needed to explore the nature of these differences.
