Abstract
Phonological speech errors reflect the linguistic knowledge of
the speaker. For example, in English, a misplaced [ŋ] will
always end up as a syllable coda, in agreement with the
phonotactic constraint that [ŋ] segments must be codas. Two
experiments showed that phonotactic knowledge and its
influence on speech errors can be easily changed. Participants
were taught to produce [ŋ] in syllable onset position, and as a
result produced errors reflecting this new knowledge.

Introduction
Phonotactic rules (or constraints) govern which sounds can
or cannot combine in a given language. An English
speaker, for example, could easily decide, without much
thought, that “blong” is a possible English word, and that
“ngob” is not. This is because the segment [ŋ], which is
common in syllable coda position in English, such as in
sing, is not available as a word onset for English speakers,
though it is acceptable in other languages, such as Burmese.
In this study, we trained English speakers to produce
syllables with [ŋ] onsets. After training, not only did the
speakers then produce these syllables, but strikingly, their
phonological speech errors included instances in which
intended [ŋ]’s (both onsets and codas) slipped to erroneous
onset positions, demonstrating some flexibility to the new
learning.
Knowledge of phonotactic constraints arises from early
experience during infancy (e.g. Jusczyk et al., 1993), but
continues to affect language processing throughout life.
Moreover, such knowledge is at least temporarily malleable.
In syllable input-processing tasks, both adults (e.g. Onishi,
Chambers & Fisher, 2002) and infants (Chambers, Onishi,
& Fisher, 2003) quickly acquire sensitivity to artificial
phonotactic constraints introduced in experimental
materials, such as a constraint that [f] only occurs as an
onset during the experiment. Sensitivity to phonotactics in
output is demonstrated by studies of phonological speech
errors. Such errors exhibit the phonotactic regularity effect:
Speech errors follow the phonotactic constraints of the
language of the speaker (Fromkin 1971). For example, a
slip such as “tlime line” for “time line” or “nging” for
“king” would not occur because initial [tl]’s or [ŋ]’s violate
English phonotactics.

The sensitivity of slips to the sound distributions in one’s
language can be changed by recent experience. Dell et al.
(2000) explored the implicit learning of new arbitrary
phonotactic constraints and demonstrated that slip patterns
reflect the experimentally induced constraints. In a syllable
production task, participants recited syllables that contained
artificial (but legal in English) phonotactic constraints (e.g.
[f] is always onset, [s] is always coda). An analysis of
speech errors showed that participants were able to learn
these new constraints, as they were significantly more likely
to produce errors that obeyed the new constraints than errors
that violated them. These results have been replicated and
extended by Goldrick (2004), Taylor and Houghton (2005)
and Warker and Dell (2006). It is important to note that, in
all of these studies, the artificial language is actually more
restricted than English, the participants’ native language.
For example, in Warker and Dell’s (2006) artificial
language, the consonants [k], [g], [m], and [n] were
restricted to either onset or coda position, whereas these
consonants can appear in either environment in English.
While the participants readily learn these new phonotactic
constraints, they are learning by excluding, rather than
adding, sequences. This state of affairs is illustrated in the
left half of Figure 1, in which the artificial phonology allows
a subset of what is allowed by English.
If the implicit learning that occurs during these
experiments is a product of a powerful acquisition process,
it should have some ability to step outside of the
phonological system of the speaker and learn new
constraints, rather than simply prime a subset of the existing
system. That is, it should be able to learn constraints that
define genuinely new sequences (right half of Figure 1). The
present study provides evidence of this.
The first experiment examined whether participants were
able to learn a phonological constraint that is illegal in their
native language ([ŋ]-onsets). In this experiment, the only
[ŋ]-segments participants were exposed to occurred in
syllable onset position. The second experiment allowed [ŋ]
segments to occur at both onset and coda positions, and
examined whether participants were able to learn [ŋ] as a
possible onset, even when presented with [ŋ] codas (which,
in English, always occur in syllable coda position).

Participants
Six students of the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign were compensated for participating in the
experiment. Each was a native speaker of English who had
studied a foreign language at high school age or later
(excluding languages that permit [ŋ]-onsets). The data from
two participants were not analyzed (one was unable to keep
rhythm with the metronome, the other unable to produce
[ŋ]-onsets).

Training
Figure 1: Experimental syllables.

To prepare participants for producing [ŋ] onsets in the main
experiment, a training procedure was developed. There
were five steps, using flash cards, in the training. In the first
step, participants were asked to recite one-syllable words
with [ŋ] codas (hang, long, ring, wing). In the second step,
they recited two-syllable words with a medial [ŋ] (hanging,
longing, ringing, winged). Next, the words presented to the
participants for recitation were separated into their syllables
(hang-ing, long-ing, ring-ing, wing-ed). In the next step,
these were separated before the coda of the first syllable,
making [ŋ] the first sound of the second syllable (ha-nging,
lo-nging, ri-nging, wi-nged).
Finally, participants
performed drills, producing syllables with [ŋ] onsets and
vowel codas (nga, nga, nga, ngo, ngo, ngo, ngi, ngi, ngi). At
all steps, the experimenter demonstrated [ŋ] onsets and
provided more training trials at the request of participants.
Because the sound [ŋ] is always spelled “ng” in English, all
written materials expressed the sound using the English
spelling.

The key question for both experiments is whether
participants’ experience producing [ŋ] onsets will lead to
speech errors in which [ŋ] slips to onset position.
Previously, in studies in which [ŋ] was not trained as an
onset (e.g. Dell et al., 2000), it never slipped to onset
position. The presence of [ŋ] onsets in the present study
would support an approach to linguistic knowledge that
recognizes the role of recent experience in shaping that
knowledge.

Experiment 1
Participants repeated 4-syllable CVC sequences in time to
a metronome. Metronome pacing was chosen to promote
the production of errors without forcing an abnormally fast
speech rate.
The syllables were made up of eight
consonants ([h], [ŋ], [f], [s], [k], [g], [m], [n]) and the vowel
[E] (as in bed). [k], [g], [f], [s], [m], and [n] could appear
either as onset or coda in any sequence. Following the
phonotactic constraints of English, [h] only appeared as
onset. However, [ŋ] which in English always appears in
coda position, was restricted to onset position, creating
sequences such as “hem, gef, ŋes, nek.” As in previous
studies, we expect slips such as “hem gef Æ hem hef.” [h]
should always maintain its onset position when it slips
because [h] is always an onset both in English and in this
experiment. We would also expect slips such as “hem gef”
Æ “gem gef” in which the unrestricted consonant [g] moves
from onset to onset, and that these would be somewhat more
likely than slips such as “hem gef” Æ “heg gef”, in which
[g] moves from onset to coda. But such cross-positional or
“illegal” movement should occur for unrestricted
consonants because these occur as both onsets and codas in
the experiment.
The critical data in the experiment involve slips in which
[ŋ]’s move. Will they move only to coda position, as
dictated by English phonotactics? Or will there be some
movement to onset, for example, “gef Æ ŋef”?

Materials
For each participant, a set of 96 four-syllable sequences was
randomly generated, subject to the constraints described
above. Each consonant appeared exactly once in each
sequence.
Each set of sequences was printed in 16-point bold Ariel
lowercase font one sequence per line and 16 lines per page
(6 pages per participant, total), and presented on paper. A
window over the page was used to present only one
sequence at a time.

Procedure

2372

After completion of the training set, participants were
presented with the sequences to recite. Participants spoke
into a microphone in a soundproof room, and were recorded
using a Kay Elemetrics recorder, and analyzed using Cool
Edit software. Each sequence was read a total of four times.
To ensure that participants were familiar with each sequence
before each trial, each sequence was first recited once at a
rate of 1 beat per second (speaking in time with the beats of
a metronome). Next, each sequence was recited three times
at a rate of 2.53 beats per second. To familiarize them with
the speeded recitation task, participants were each first

given four sequences to recite (not recorded), using the
same protocol as in the recorded trials.

Results and discussion
Recordings of the participants’ recitations were analyzed for
errors by the experimenter. A syllable was judged to
contain an error if a participant replaced one consonant with
another from the sequence.
Sequences in which a
participant began a syllable with an incorrect consonant and
self-corrected (e.g. hem Æ k-hem) were also coded as
errors. Vowel errors were not counted, nor were those
containing a consonant from outside the experiment. 212
consonant movement errors were identified.
The coding reliability was acceptable. A second coder,
unaware of the experimental conditions, listened to the
recordings of a subset of the produced syllables (2304
syllables). The coders agreed on 98% of the codes. As most
of these were agreements regarding the absence of an error,
it is useful to note that there were 45 syllables where both
coders agreed that an error was present. Of these, they
agreed on what the error was for 42 syllables. The coding
reliability of [ŋ] targets and errors, in particular, was also
acceptable. On the 288 [ŋ] targets in this sample, the coders
agreed on 96% of the codes, and there were no
mispronounced [ŋ] targets or other consonants
mispronounced as [ŋ] where the two coders assigned
different errors. (There were 5 cases, though, where the
second coder labeled as correct what was initially coded as
some other consonant slipping to [ŋ]).
Although the number and types of errors produced by
each participant varied, all participants produced [ŋ] onsets.
In a comparison of correctly produced onsets, it was found
that, overall, participants correctly produced [ŋ] onsets at
about the same rate as they produced any other onset.
Overall, [ŋ] onsets were produced correctly 97.2% of the
time, which was nearly the same as that for other onsets
which were correct 96.8% of the time (t = 0.54). Figure 2
shows a spectrogram of a correctly produced onset [ŋ].
There is a clear nasal onset in conjunction with formant
transitions indicative of a velar place of articulation.
Next, the probability of [ŋ] movement errors was
considered, that is, cases where some other consonant was
replaced by [ŋ]. Across the 4 participants, there were 32
cases of [ŋ] movement. Crucially, 50% of that movement
was to onset position, and all four participants produced at
least one such error. Figure 3 shows the spectrogram for an
utterance in which the onset is incorrectly replaced by an
[ŋ]. Again, the [ŋ] appears to be well formed. Given that 0%
of the [ŋ] movement errors in Dell et al. (2000) or Warker
and Dell (2006) were to onset position, it is safe to conclude
that these [ŋ]-onset errors reflect the current participants’
recent experience producing [ŋ]-onsets. Interestingly, of all
syllable onsets produced correctly, those with [ŋ] onsets
were found to be significantly more likely to have errors in
coda position than syllables with any other correctly
produced onset (2.8% vs. 1.2% of syllables respectively, t=
3.26, p < .05). Perhaps extra attention directed to the

The results suggest that native speakers of English learned
something akin to the constraint: [ŋ] can be an onset during
this experiment. Evidence of such learning comes from the
fact that participants produced [ŋ] onsets when they
intended to produce another onset. Specifically, [ŋ]’s
slipped to onset position 50% of the time. Without
experience with [ŋ] onsets, [ŋ]’s invariably slip to coda
position. But this experience within the experiment does
not make the production of [ŋ]’s easy. The participants’
lifelong experience of nothing but [ŋ]-codas prior to the
experiment is seen in the findings that [ŋ] errors emerged as
onsets to a lesser extent than other consonants did, and
correctly produced [ŋ] onsets caused coda errors.
Experiment 1 showed that participants produced [ŋ] onset
slips when [ŋ] was restricted to onset position. Experiment
2 tested whether participants would still produce [ŋ] onset
slips if the stimuli included [ŋ] codas.

Experiment 2
Method

2373

The method used was the same as in Experiment 1, except
that instead of being restricted to onset position, [ŋ] was left
unrestricted, and appeared equally frequently in onset and
coda position. Five new participants from the same
population as those in Experiment 1 were trained on onset[ŋ] pronunciation and then performed the sequence
recitation task. The data of one participant was not
analyzed, due to an inability to perform the task.

Results and discussion.
Recordings of the participants’ recitations were analyzed as
they were in Experiment 1. 208 consonant errors were
recorded. Coding reliability (based on 2304 syllables—288
with [ŋ] onsets-- listened to by a second coder) was similar
to that of the first experiment. There was 98% agreement on
codes both for all syllables and target [ŋ]-onsets and there
were no cases involving [ŋ]-onsets as targets or errors in
which the two coders assigned different errors. There were 4
cases, though, where the second coder labeled as correct
what was initially coded as some other consonant slipping
to [ŋ], and 3 cases of the reverse.
As in Experiment 1, all participants produced target [ŋ]
onsets correctly for the most part (95% correct). In an
analysis of the 54 [ŋ] movement errors, [ŋ] onsets slipped to
onset, as opposed to coda position, 42% of the time. This
can be contrasted with the fact that [ŋ] codas slipped to
coda, as opposed to onset, position 75% of the time. The
other unrestricted consonants, ([f], [s], [m], [n], [k], and [g])
maintained their positions when they slipped, 68% of the
time for onsets and 73% for codas.
[h], which was
restricted to onset position, never slipped to coda position.
The much larger tendency for [ŋ] to slip from coda to coda
than onset to onset is likely the result of the participants’
lifetime of experience with English
These results reinforce those of the first experiment. Both
experiments found many instances in which [ŋ]-onsets
moved to other onset positions. The second experiment,
though, found 7 instances in which [ŋ]-codas moved to
onset position. Three of the four scored participants
produced errors that resulted in unintended [ŋ]-onsets, and
two of them produced [ŋ]-onsets in which the source of the
error was an an [ŋ]-coda. The presence of other [ŋ]-onsets
in the stimulus materials apparently licensed the onset
position for [ŋ], setting the stage for the coda-to-onset slips.
Note that, in natural speech-error collections and in previous
experiments with [ŋ] restricted to the coda slot, no coda-toonset errors have been observed.

General Discussion
In two experiments, participants learned a phonotactic
pattern that is contrary to the linguistic information they
have been exposed to over their lifetimes. The learning was
revealed in their production of errors. Errors that form [ŋ]onset syllables do not occur in natural studies of speech
errors and in experimental studies that do not expose the
speakers to [ŋ]-onsets. Here, when [ŋ]-onsets were required
to be spoken, [ŋ]-onsets also emerged in their slips.
The results are particularly important because findings
from previous studies of implicit learning of artificial
phonotactic constraints in production (e.g. Dell et al., 2000)
can be attributed to a “local tuning of an already learned
syllabic structure” (Taylor & Houghton, 2005, p. 1415).
That is, the previous studies do not definitively show that

recent experience can actually change the core of the
phonological processing system, a core that is based on the
constraints that define the legal and illegal sequences for the
speaker’s language. They may only demonstrate that known
syllables and syllable types can be primed by exposure. Our
results challenge this limited view of the learning process.
The data presented here thus offer evidence of a powerful
acquisition process that allows new information to be
integrated into the existing phonological processing system.
More generally, they suggest that language learning never
stops. The processing system adapts to recent experience,
while continuing to reflect the accumulated experience of a
lifetime of speaking and listening.
