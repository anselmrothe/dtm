evaluation process involved in company perception with
the existing literature in the field. The first objective is to
find common grounds in the everyday evaluation of
companies. These commonalities are put into relation to
more universal perceptive and cognitive processes.
Research investigating similarity and dissimilarity
mainly divides into two fields: feature based differentiation
versus holistic differentiation. The former goes back to
Osgood and colleagues postulating general dimensions for
evaluating objects (Osgood, Tannenbaum, & Suci, 1957).
In this semantic differential approach different adjectives
were searched for which best describe meaningful
differences. The claim was made that a restricted number
of adverbial quantifiers can be sufficient to describe
various categories of objects, reaching from colors and
shapes to stories and people. The later, holistic
differentiation, assumes an evaluation space which does
not necessarily reflect different dimension but an integrated
feeling of similarity. This so called perceived similarity is a
direct evaluation and found its conceptualization in
prototype models. Both approaches can be used to describe
experienced similarity between two or more objects.
Equally for both, we can assume that underling factors of
the objects explain the experienced similarity and
dissimilarity. These factors may link directly or indirectly
to featural differences, but either way explain variations in
observed behavior. This perspective is common in
personality research where different ‘personality
dimensions’ are used to explain individual differences
(compare Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985; Cattell, 1965). Brand
perception research documents parallels between the
perception of people and the perception of brands (i.e.
Epstein, 1977). A similar claim is made by Lievens and
Highhouse (2003) for the evaluation of organizational
attractiveness. When describing an organization, similar
descriptors are used as when describing categories like
friends or strangers. This can be seen in close relation to
the own likes and dislikes. We assume that a general
‘relational evaluation’ is taking place where an
organization, company, or corporation is positioned on

Abstract
As any other object, companies can be evaluated on different
dimensions. Unclear is which dimensions best describe the
perception of companies, organizations, or brands and how
similar the most discriminating dimensions are to
differentiators in other perceptive processes. Also of
importance is if, and then how, the derived scales for
company differences link to reputation, business
characteristics, and sustained success of a company.
First, repeated evaluations are used to distil the most
useful scales for company comparisons. In a second step, a
broader range of companies is positioned on these derived
dimensions through aggregated individual assessments.
These assessments directly reflect the public perception of
the company, which can be tracked over time. Links to
future success or failure of a company are assumed to be
establishable, once further long term observations are
achieved.
The relative position of a company can serve diverse
business incentives and can objectify aims of business
strategies by setting respective targets. And more generally,
by providing perceptional scales for companies, in addition
to the market price, less volatile evaluations become
available.

Introduction
In the continuous interaction with our environment we
need not only to be able to quickly perceive new
information, we also have to rely on existing information
as a benchmark. When eating breakfast, greeting a person,
or driving a business, we always have to understand the
differences within the various environments and need
specific concepts to guide our behavior. Is there a general
mechanism which describes this formation of differences
between perceived objects? Does the perception and
evaluation of food, faces, and fortunes have something in
common? Do we apply comparable processes in these
different domains? To tackle this question we compare the

the main descriptors for companies.
The elicited dimensions might proof useful for future
evaluations of companies. On the one hand they are
derived without providing any specific context. On the
other hand they are only partly in line with the existing
literature, possibly adding formerly neglected areas of
systematic company differences. But only a larger dataset
will allow more systematic derivations. To further evaluate
the dimensions differentiating between companies, we
compare the derived company concepts with existing
company descriptors in this field. In Study 2 we decrease
the number of descriptive dimensions to facilitate the later
evaluation. Economic measures are then introduced and put
in relation in Study 3.

Company Evaluation Dimensions
A simple rating method is used to evaluate the different
proposed descriptive adjectives. Besides finding the most
useful dimensions, also redundancies are captured and the
adjectives are put into relation.
For the study we took all the different dimensions from
the literature and made a computer based evaluation of
each. As illustrated in Study 1 the different sources show
overlaps in the adjectives used as company descriptors.
Here we just left away redundant dimensions and included
all proposed dimensions (Aaker, 1997; Slaughter et al.,
2004; Heise, 1970) and our newly derived dimensions.

differentiating adjectives based on the company means.
The adjectives nicely group together into higher levels,
forming different aspects of company characteristics. The
different clustering steps describe different aggregation
levels for company evaluation.

Discussion

20 students (10 male; 10 female; average age 26) took part
in the study who were paid £12 ($22) each. The computer
based rating lasted approximately 120 minutes and took
place in separate rooms for each individual. Subjects had to
rate 20 companies on all the 118 adjectives (which were
introduced in the discussion of Study 1). A Likert Scale
from 1 to 5 was used. Companies were repeatedly named
ones and representatives for different industries, all taken
from Study 1. They were displayed together for each
adjective but the adjective order and the company order
was randomized in each set and over participants. The
company ratings were analyzed according to the relation of
inter company variability to inter-individual variability.

When using different adjectives to evaluate companies the
newly elicited ones are highly useful. Due to the restriction
to a small number of companies less frequent company
facets might have been left apart. Therefore only the more
general themes are focused. Interesting here is not only
how single adjectives describe the companies but how
these aggregate into factors. But also for finding out about
the fundamental dimensions a larger body of companies is
needed.

Company Positioning
To estimate how important the different company
dimensions are relative to each other, we ran a further
study which systematically evaluates the different
dimensions and distills the most important factors in the
perception of companies.

Results
The most differentiating adjectives were defined as
explaining the most variance in company values averaged
over subjects. For these at least half of the total variance is
explained by the differences between company mean
values rather than individual rating differences between
subjects. The adjectives below this cutoff were left aside
due to their high inter-individual variability. RepGrid
adjectives are included the most with 14 out of 31
representing these newly elicited dimensions. For the other
sources there are 10, 6, and 5 cases in the highly
differentiating group for the Brand Personality, Semantic
Differential, and Organization Personality adjectives
respectively.

Method
64 large UK companies and globally operating companies
were evaluated on 41 adjectives in an online survey. 1282
people took part in the study (40% female, average age
38.5). Subjects were recruited and paid via the Ipoints webservice. Each evaluation lasted approximately 10 minutes.
Every subject evaluated all 64 companies on four
adjectives. The companies were displayed together, but

rated by 100 subjects on a five point Likert Scale.
A Factor analysis describes the underlying dimensions of
company evaluations. These factors are then put in relation
to economic company descriptors.

The usage of the adjectives on a broader range of
companies nicely allows for a grouping of the different
adjectives. These groups or factors illustrate the underlying
categorical differences and nicely link to economic
measures for company performance.
In the factor analysis the Eigenvalues of the principal
factors flatten out after the fourth factor which is illustrated
in Figure 2. Although factor five is, with an Eigenvalue of
1.08, slightly above one, due to the drop before we only

The equamax rotated factor solution is shown in Table 2.
The rotated solution nicely separates into the factors
‘Honesty’, ‘Prestige’, ‘Innovation’, and ‘Power’. The first
factor which we labeled ‘Honesty’ captures fairness and
honesty of a company. ‘Prestige’ is a dimension of how
accepted and how valued a company is. With ‘Innovation’
the vividness and flexibility of a company is described.
‘Power’ as the fourth factor shows how important or ruling
a company is.

In the next step the factor values of the British
companies where correlated with economic measures of
size, evaluation, growth, and profit. Table 3 shows the
spearman correlation for the four factors based on the 25
companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Company
measures are taken from an economic database namely
Datastream. Size stands for the total assets employed,
Evaluation for the market to book value, Growth for the 3
year growth in sales, Profit for the pre-tax profit.

General Discussion
Further evaluations appear necessary to support the
universality and validity of the derived corporate factors.
But these can nicely go together with perceptive and
cognitive processes for evaluations in other domains. What
exactly the differences are between the domains and how
they can be put on a common ground is still an interesting
research agenda. The usage of cognitive results in different
tasks and process evaluations in a more applied context
appear demandable and can establish a more substantial
knowledge transfer between psychology and economics.

The derived factors show direct relations to company
performance measures. The Prestige factor strongly
correlates with the measure for company size and the
Innovation factor with the measure for company growth.

Discussion
The factors can be of potential use for the understanding of
company perception and the development of evaluation
criteria for companies. The factor correlation also indicate
possible relations with economic measures which might
proof useful as performance predictors. Although,
evaluations over time and on a larger body of companies is
necessary to proof the strength and the directionality of
these relations.
Also interesting relations can be drawn from the derived
factors to the concept of Semantic Differentials. The
Innovation factor fits with the Activity dimension, Prestige
goes together with the Evaluation dimension, and Power
with the Potency dimension. Only Honesty comes in as an
additional factor for the evaluation of companies which
seemed not to be necessary for other evaluations.
