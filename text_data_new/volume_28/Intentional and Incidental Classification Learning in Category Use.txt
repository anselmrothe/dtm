Abstract
Traditional classification learning studies tell us that people
learn to attend to the diagnostic features of exemplars
(Kruschke, 1992; Medin & Schaffer, 1978; Shepard, Hovland,
& Jenkins, 1961). But recent research has discovered that the
learning task influences what information people learn about
categories (Markman & Ross, 2003). A learning task can
either be the primary goal or be incidental to some other
larger goal. This study investigated how intentional vs.
incidental classification changes the kind of category
information learned. The intentional classification group
replicated previous studies by learning the diagnostic features,
while the incidental classification group acquired information
beyond the diagnostic features.
Keywords: categorization; implicit learning; implicit memory

Introduction
For much of the last 30 years, classification learning has
been considered the central strategy to forming concepts
(Barsalou, 1990; Chin-Parker & Ross, 2004; Estes, 1994;
Kruschke, 1992). But outside the laboratory, people do not
always learn categories as a main goal; they learn categories
for some kind of use (Brooks, 1999). Markman and Ross
(2003) argue that traditional classification learning studies
overemphasize explicit classifications, even though people
often make implicit classifications outside the laboratory.
For example, customers do not examine merchandise in a
sports store and explicitly ask, “Is this a running shoe or a
boxing glove?” Rather, they implicitly classify items as part
of the larger goal of shopping.
In this light, classification learning can be split into (at
least) two types: intentional classification and incidental
classification. Intentional classification learning occurs
when one is explicitly aware of the classification task, such
that it becomes the primary goal. Incidental classification
learning is performed in support of some other goal.
Category information can be split into (at least) two types:
diagnostic features and prototypical features. Diagnostic
features are those that inform us how to select members that
belong to a category while excluding those that do not. The
diagnostic features of a category are defined by other
categories.
For example, having hair is useful in
distinguishing between dolphins and sharks, but not
between dolphins and whales. Thus, diagnostic features
provide between-category information.
In family resemblance category structures (Rosch &
Mervis, 1975), prototypical features are those commonly
found in the members of a category. The prototypical
features of a category stay the same regardless of the

2047

contrasting category. For example, some prototypical
features of a dog are that it has four legs, fur, and a tail that
it wags when it’s happy. Thus, prototypical features
provide within-category information.
Because intentional classification learning encourages
people to explicitly focus on between-category information,
this task facilitates the learning of diagnostic features
(Kruschke, 1992; Medin & Schaffer, 1978; Shepard,
Hovland, & Jenkins, 1961), but not the non-diagnostic, yet
prototypical, features (Chin-Parker & Ross, 2004). On the
other hand, incidental classification does not as strongly
stress the importance of distinguishing between categories,
which could create the opportunity to learn more withincategory information (the prototypical features).
In the current research, it was hypothesized that the
intentional classification group would learn a high amount
of diagnostic information and a low (close to zero) amount
of non-diagnostic information. It was also hypothesized
that the incidental classification group would learn less
diagnostic information than the intentional group, but more
of the non-diagnostic (prototypical) information. In other
words, each learning task would benefit from a gain in one
type of information and a loss in the other.
There has been some previous research investigating how
intentional vs. incidental classification affects what is
learned about categories. For example, incidental learners
are more likely to claim that they discovered a single
defining feature that perfectly predicted category
membership (Brooks, Squire-Graydon, & Wood, 1998).
Three groups learned family resemblance categories by
explicitly analyzing items for rules, by memorizing items, or
by learning items incidentally to playing a board game. The
incidental group made an average of 2.5% errors in the 10
trials preceding the test phase, but any single-feature rule
would have resulted in at least 20% errors. That is,
incidental learners believed that the categories had simple
defining features, despite the fact that their categorization
behavior was more complex. Brooks et al. called this the
“simpler than it is” phenomenon, in that a person’s belief
about the nature of categories is not necessarily consistent
with actual categorization behavior (Murphy, 2002).

Current Research
In this experiment, the performance of participants in the
intentional classification task was compared with the
performance of participants in the incidental classification
task. Borrowing from the Brooks et al. (1998) study,
participants in both conditions learned two categories of
bugs while playing a board game. But in each trial, the
intentional group classified exemplars before playing the

game, while the incidental group performed classifications
at the moment of category use. This manipulation had the
intentional group make explicit classifications as a primary
goal, and had the incidental group make classifications in
support of the main goal of playing the game.
The results of Brooks et al. suggest that the incidental
classification group did not explicitly analyze their
categorization behavior because of their false belief in
defining features, even though the incidental group was able
to perform correct classifications. If there is this difference
between learning tasks, then there might also exist a
difference in what information is learned and how it is
learned. Two transfer tasks were used to test for explicit
and implicit learning of category information.

Method
Design This experiment had two between-subjects factors.
First, participants were assigned to either the intentional
classification learning condition or the incidental
classification learning condition. Second, assignment of
physical feature dimensions to dimensions of the abstract
category structures was counterbalanced.
Participants Sixty-nine undergraduates from New York
University participated for course credit. Twenty-nine
participants, 12 from the intentional condition and 17 from
the incidental condition, did not meet the learning criterion,
and their data was excluded in the analyses. Non-learners
were replaced with new participants from the same
population. Participants were randomly assigned to a
learning condition, and within each learning condition a
participant was randomly assigned to 1 of 10
counterbalancing groups. This resulted in an equal number
of participants (2) in each cell of this experiment’s 20 cell
design.

(antennae & eyes are non-diagnostic).
Materials The materials were drawings of bugs (Figure 1)
on a chess-style game board, presented on a computer
monitor. Each participant learned 2 categories of bugs
called Kez and Dax. Each bug category varied on 5 binary
dimensions: antennae, eyes, body stripes, legs, and tail. The
bug categories were both family resemblance structures;
each prototypical feature occurred 80% of the time among a
category’s exemplars. Two features of the Kez and Dax
prototypes overlapped causing them to be non-diagnostic,
and the remaining 3 features were diagnostic (Table 1).
Across participants within both learning conditions, the
feature dimensions were counterbalanced such that each
played the role of a diagnostic dimension an equal number
of times.
Category exemplars varied on the number of diagnostic
and prototypical features (Table 2). An exemplar could
have 1, 2, or 3 of its diagnostic features. When an exemplar
had 5 features consistent with its prototype, it was labeled
Prototype. With 4 consistent features, it was labeled Close.
With 3 consistent features, it was labeled Far.
Using the example category set in Table 1 (with Kez and
Dax prototypes of 11111 and 11000, respectively), the Kez
exemplar 01111 would be a Close3 item because it has 4
prototypically-consistent features and all 3 diagnostic
features. But if a participant learned the Dax category
structure with the prototype 00011 instead of 11000, that
same Kez exemplar 01111 would be a Close2 item because
it still has 4 prototypically-consistent features, but it only
has 2 diagnostic features.
In the learning phase, all participants studied the 5 Close
bugs from both categories, resulting in 10 learning
exemplars. In the transfer phase, participants were given a
typicality-ratings task for 16 exemplars from both
categories, resulting in 32 separate ratings. These 16
exemplars consisted of the 5 Close exemplars from the
learning phase, and 11 previously unseen exemplars
including the category Prototype and 10 Far exemplars.
Procedure All phases of the experiment were conducted on
PCs running Windows 98 using a custom-developed game
programmed in C++ and OpenGL. All participants were
verbally debriefed and provided with a written statement
that described the purpose of the experiment.
Prior to the learning phase, all participants were told that
they would play a board game where they would be required

to move a game piece (an exemplar) to a goal position in the
least number of moves. That is, they were under the
assumption that this was a path-finding experiment, even
though path-finding played no role in meeting the learning
criterion. It was also explained to participants that there
were 2 kinds of game pieces called Kez and Dax bugs, and
that the Kez bugs could only move in straight lines
horizontally and vertically, and that the Dax bugs could only
move in diagonal lines.
For each trial, the game piece and the goal position were
randomly placed such that it was possible to move the game
piece as either a Kez or a Dax to the goal position. This fact
precluded the determination of category membership based
on starting positions. The category exemplar was rendered
on the game board (Figure 2), representing the participant’s
game piece. The game piece was moved with the mouse by
clicking on one of the adjacent squares, one square at a time,
until a path was drawn from the starting position to the goal
position.
In every trial of the intentional learning condition,
participants were first presented with a screen displaying
only the category exemplar and the explicit question, “Is
this a Kez or a Dax?” The game board was not present
during intentional classifications, which separated the
explicit learning from the category use. Participants made
their selection with the mouse by clicking one of two
buttons labeled “Kez” and “Dax”, and received feedback.
After each intentional classification, participants played the
game, moving the game piece to the goal position, with the
intention of drawing a path in the least number of moves. If
a participant tried to move in a direction not suited to the
exemplar’s category, nothing would happen. That is, no
feedback occurred after the initial classification, limiting
feedback to only once per trial in the intentional learning
condition.

2049

In every trial of the incidental learning condition,
participants were never explicitly questioned about category
membership. Instead, they only played the path-finding
game in each trial. The incidental group also received
feedback at a maximum of once per trial, but only on the
first mistake made in moving the game piece. If a
participant made no errors in moving during a trial, no
feedback was given (although the absence of feedback was
itself a form of feedback). In order to know how to move a
game piece correctly, participants had to incidentally
classify it as a Kez or a Dax. Making classification
judgments at the moment of category use diverted attention
to a goal other than explicit categorization in the incidental
learning condition.
All participants played the game for a minimum of 4
blocks and a maximum of 40 blocks. There were 10 trials
per block, and the game was self-paced. The learning
criterion was passed when a participant successfully
classified at least 9 of 10 exemplars for 2 consecutive
blocks, and path-finding ability was irrelevant.
Following learning, all participants performed two
transfer tasks. The first transfer task consisted of typicality
ratings for 32 different exemplars, and tested recognition
ability for diagnostic and prototypical features. Participants
randomly saw 16 Kez exemplars of varying diagnosticity
and prototypicality, and for each one they were asked, “How
typical is this Kez?” They responded with the mouse by
clicking 1 of 7 buttons (1 being “not at all typical” to 7
being “very typical”). Participants then performed the same
ratings task with the 16 Dax exemplars.
The second transfer task had participants generate what
they thought were the most typical Kez and Dax bugs, and
tested recollection ability for diagnostic and prototypical
features. First, participants drew the most typical Kez with
the mouse by clicking on verbal descriptions of the binary
features, such as “two eyes” or “three eyes,” and “two legs”
or “four legs.” After drawing the most typical Kez,
participants clicked a button to continue and drew the most
typical Dax. It was not possible to continue until a feature
for each dimension was selected.

Results and Discussion
Learning Phase The intentional group showed a clear
advantage in learning over the incidental group. To start,
62.5% of the intentional participants met the learning
criterion, compared to 54.1% of the incidental participants.
For those that learned the two categories, there was a
significant difference between groups in the number of
blocks needed to meet the learning criterion, t(38) = -2.36, p
< .05. The intentional group needed an average of 15.90
(SD = 7.48) blocks to learn, and the incidental group needed
an average of 21.75 (SD = 8.18) blocks to learn. So not
only did more intentional learners meet the learning
criterion, they also met the criterion faster than the
incidental learners.
In order to analyze the number of errors per learning
block over time, the number of errors over every 4 blocks

was averaged into a batch for all 40 potential blocks, so that
there were 10 batches of errors/blocks per participant. Not
all participants played the game for all 40 blocks, and some
batches for some participants included in the analysis
contained zero errors. A two-way mixed measures analysis
of variance (ANOVA), with the 10 batches of errors/block
as the within-subject factor and learning condition as the
between-subjects factor, revealed a significant effect of
learning condition, F(1, 38) = 7.34, MSE = 4.73, p = .01, a
significant effect of batch number, F(9, 342) = 106.99, MSE
= .76, p < .001, and a significant interaction, F(9, 342) =
2.84, MSE = .76, p < .01. This result reflects the faster
learning achieved by the intentional group over the
incidental group, suggesting that the participants in the two
learning conditions engaged distinct learning strategies
(Figure 3).
Transfer Phase: Typicality Ratings Only participants who
met the learning criterion were included in the following
analyses. Following Chin-Parker and Ross (2004), separate
measures were calculated from the typicality ratings. To
measure the effect of the learned diagnostic features, the
diagnosticity drop was calculated by averaging the
typicality ratings change when diagnosticity varied but
prototypicality remained constant. The average typicality
ratings change between the Close3 and Close2 exemplars,
the Far3 and Far2 exemplars, and the Far2 and Far1
exemplars, all had varied diagnosticity but identical
prototypicality between comparisons. To measure the effect
of prototypicality, the prototypicality drop was calculated
by averaging the typicality ratings change when
prototypicality varied while diagnosticity remained
constant. The average typicality ratings change between the
Prototype and Close3 exemplars, the Close3 and Far3
exemplars, and the Close2 and Far2 exemplars, all had
varied prototypicality but identical diagnosticity between
comparisons.
The intentional group had a large diagnosticity drop of
1.03 (SD = .70), but their prototypicality drop was near zero,

at .03 (SD = .52). The incidental group had an even larger
diagnosticity drop of 1.40 (SD = .88), and a prototypicality
drop of .19 (SD = .47). A diagnosticity or prototypicality
drop of zero indicates that no information was learned. A
positive diagnosticity drop indicates learned diagnostic
features, and a positive prototypicality drop indicates
learned non-diagnostic features. In Figure 4, it can be seen
that both the intentional and incidental group learned
diagnostic features, and that only the incidental group
learned some non-diagnostic features.
For the intentional group, separate t-tests showed that
their diagnosticity drop was significantly different from
zero, t(19) = 6.60, p < .001, but that their prototypicality
drop was not, t < 1. In other words, the intentional group
was good at acquiring diagnostic features, but not nondiagnostic features.
For the incidental group, their
diagnosticity drop was also significant, t(19) = 7.14, p <
.001, and their prototypicality drop bordered on
significance, t(19) = 1.82, p < .08. Upon removing a single
outlier1 from the incidental group, their prototypicality drop
became significant, t(18) = 2.37, p < .05. In other words,
the incidental group was also able to acquire diagnostic
features, and they were better at learning the non-diagnostic
features than the intentional group who learned none.
A two-way mixed measures ANOVA, with the type of
drop as the within-subject factor and learning condition as
the between-subjects factor, revealed a significant effect of
learning condition, F(1, 38) = 6.28, MSE = .22, p < .05, a
significant effect of drop type, F(1, 38) = 37.75, MSE = .65,
p < .001, and no interaction, F < 1. These results show that
learning condition affected what was learned, and that there
was a significant difference in the amount of learned
diagnostic vs. non-diagnostic features within both
conditions. Contrary to the hypothesis, there was no

The outlier was chosen due to its highly negative prototypicality
drop of -.67, which was unusual compared to the rest of the
incidental group. An individual who learned no non-diagnostic
information would be expected to exhibit a prototypicality drop of
zero, while a person who learned some would have a positive drop.

interaction. The hypothesis predicted that each learning
condition would provide a gain in one type of category
information and a loss in another. Incidental classification
learning appears to have gains in both types of category
information over intentional classification learning.
Independent samples t-tests showed that only the
diagnosticity drop between the Far2 and Far1 items was
significant between groups, t(38) = -2.21, p < .05 (Table 3).
All other separate diagnosticity and prototypicality drops
were not significantly different between groups, t < 1. This
means that the difference between learning conditions in
diagnosticity drop is due to how participants reacted to the
previously unseen Far2 and Far1 items in the typicality
ratings task.
The intentional group rated the Far1 items as 3.39, which
indicates that they perceived those items as fairly
ambiguous (a rating of 4.0 meant it had a 50% likelihood of
being a category member). However, the incidental group
rated the Far1 items as 2.61, which indicates that they
perceived those items as poor category members (below
50%).
In the typicality ratings task, it was clear that the
intentional group was only influenced by diagnosticity.
These results replicated the findings of Chin-Parker and
Ross (2004). In contrast, the typicality ratings of the
incidental group indicated that they acquired both diagnostic
and some non-diagnostic information. However, it must
also be noted that the incidental group required significantly
more blocks to reach the learning criterion. Could their
increased sensitivity to overall category information be due
to the fact that they spent, on average, more time exposed to
the exemplars in the learning phase?
To answer this question, a linear regression of
diagnosticity drop on the number of blocks to learning was
performed. There was no significant effect of block for
either the intentional group or the incidental group, both F <
1. A similar regression for prototypicality drop also
revealed no significant effect of block for either group, both
F < 1. Therefore, one can conclude that the differences in
typicality ratings performance are a result of the differences
in learning behavior rather than a consequence of prolonged
exposure to the learning exemplars.
Transfer Phase: Picture Generation In the picture
generation task, the accuracy of the diagnostic and nondiagnostic features was measured. The intentional group
successfully drew a high proportion of diagnostic features
(M = .83, SD = .22), and they drew an above-chance (50%)
proportion of non-diagnostic features (M = .59, SD = .15).

2051

The incidental group also successfully drew a high
proportion of diagnostic features (M = .79, SD = .19), but
they drew a near-chance proportion of non-diagnostic
features (M = .53, SD = .11).
A mixed measures ANOVA, with the type of proportion
as the within-subject factor and learning condition as the
between-subjects factor, revealed no effect of learning
condition, F(1, 38) = 1.99, MSE = .03, p = .16, a main effect
of feature diagnosticity, F(1, 38) = 43.01, MSE = .03, p <
.001, and no interaction, F < 1. These results indicate that
despite the differences in performance in the typicality
ratings task, there was no significant difference between
learning conditions in the picture generation task. The
intentional group drew a significantly above-chance
proportion of non-diagnostic features, t(19) = 2.67, p = .01,
while the incidental group did not, t(19) = 1.00, p = .33.

General Discussion
The results of this experiment differed from the original
hypothesis.
Although, as predicted, the incidental
classification group learned some of the non-diagnostic
information, they were also seemingly better at acquiring
diagnostic information. What is interesting is that the
incidental group appears to have learned more overall
category information compared to the intentional group.
While it should be noted that the statistical effects were
small, they replicated a pilot study that produced similar
significant results.
Both the intentional and incidental participants whose
transfer data were analyzed had met the learning criterion.
Obviously all participants in both conditions had learned the
3 diagnostic features necessary to pass the criterion. Why,
then, is there a difference in diagnosticity drop between
groups if they learned (at least) the same diagnostic
features?
This result may be another indication that the incidental
group acquired more prototypical information than did the
intentional group; not that they learned more diagnostic
information. This claim may seem counterintuitive, but it is
important to remember that although the typicality ratings
allow us to separate effects between ratings, the amount of
influence both types of category information have on
individual ratings is confounded.
That is, when a
participant rates any specific item, the experimenter cannot
calculate exactly how much influence the learned diagnostic
and non-diagnostic information had on that single rating.
Recall that the significant difference between groups
occurred in the typicality ratings change between the Far2
and Far1 items’ diagnosticity drop. The intentional group
rated the Far1 items as ambiguous category members (3.39
on a 7-point scale), and the incidental group rated the same
items as poor category members (2.61 on a 7-point scale).
The incidental group used both diagnostic and nondiagnostic information, both providing reasons for giving
poor ratings on Far1 items because those items have low
diagnosticity and low prototypicality. But the intentional
group only had diagnostic information to aid in their

typicality ratings, which by itself provided a weaker basis
for negatively rating Far1 items. Thus, the availability of
non-diagnostic information to the incidental group could
have influenced their diagnosticity drop in this way.
But if the acquisition of non-diagnostic information
explains the results of the typicality ratings task, then how
does this explanation handle the fact that the incidental
group performed at chance-levels in the picture generation
task for non-diagnostic features? The incidental group was
never asked to explicitly analyze the category exemplars,
and they also engaged the exemplars with divided attention,
which might have been compensated for with implicit
learning. The involvement of implicit memory explains
why the incidental group was influenced by prototypicality
in their typicality ratings but not in their picture generations,
because implicit memory is useful in cued recognition tasks
like typicality ratings, but not in recollection tasks like
picture generation (Lockhart, 2000).
Recall the Brooks et al. (1998) study which found that the
incidental group was more likely to believe (incorrectly)
that categories possessed defining features. This belief
suggests that the incidental classification task does not
encourage explicit analysis of either the exemplars or one’s
learning behavior such that incidental learners are unaware
of the complexity of their actual categorization behavior.
The fact that the incidental group in the Brooks et al. study
still successfully used the categories hints at the idea that
they, too, might have benefited from implicit learning.
Implicitly learned categories would not be accessible to
explicit analysis, which might be the cause of the incorrect
belief in defining features. Future studies will explore the
possible relationship between implicit memory and the
belief in defining features.
In a similar study, Minda and Ross (2004) investigated
indirect category learning, which they defined as not
informing participants that there are categories to be
learned, but learning those categories improves performance
on a feedback-driven task. The indirect learning group only
made predictions about categories, but the direct learning
group first classified each exemplar before making a
prediction. The categories could be learned by attending to
either a single criterial attribute or the overall family
resemblance structure. Minda and Ross found that the
indirect learning group was more likely to learn the family
resemblance structure, and that the direct learning group
was more likely to focus on the single criterial attribute.
These results run parallel to the current research in that both
incidental classification and indirect learning result in the
acquisition of prototypical information, while both
intentional classification and direct learning focus attention
on diagnostic information.
In summary, this research expands on Markman and
Ross’s (2003) argument that the learning task used
influences what a person learns about a category.
Intentional classification learning emphasizes explicit
distinctions between categories with the primary goal of
learning the categories. The most efficient method of

2052

achieving this goal is to focus on and learn the diagnostic
features, as the participants did. On the other hand,
incidental classification learning does not emphasize
explicit distinctions between categories, and it is done in
support of some other goal. Future research will explore
whether it is the incidental aspect of this learning task that
promotes the learning of prototypical features, or if it is the
main goal of category use (e.g., path-finding, prediction,
shopping, etc.) that determines if prototypical features are
learned. Perhaps there are some category uses, like bird
watching and rock collecting, which stress explicit
distinctions between categories such that incidental
classification would also result in only learning diagnostic
features.
