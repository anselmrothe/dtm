Abstract
The question how second and/or third languages are
represented in the brain has been the focus of many
neuroimaging studies. Some investigators found at least partly
different representations for different languages; others
reported findings that do not support the hypothesis that
different languages are represented in distinct brain regions.
However, these different findings can often be explained by
differences in experimental set up and by the selection of the
bilingual- and multilingual participants. Recently, structural
MRI has been used for second language research, as well. Can
structural MRI give us a better understanding of the
mechanisms behind second and/or third language acquisition?
In this paper, functional- and structural neuroimaging data
will be discussed in order to answer that question.
Keywords: second language acquisition; functional MRI;
PET; structural MRI.

Language Representation
An important question that is asked in many studies is how
second and/or third languages are represented in the brain.
A major hypothesis is that, in bilinguals and polyglots, the
different languages are represented and processed in distinct
brain regions. Some indirect evidence for this hypothesis
has been found in bilinguals and/or polyglots suffering from
aphasia (Paradis, 1989). It was occasionally observed that
only one of the mastered languages was affected (Albert &
Obler, 1978; Paradis, 1995). Moreover, it is not unusual to
find that different languages recover to different degrees or
even that there is an antagonistic pattern of recovery
between two languages (Paradis, 1977). Neurosurgery as
well, may lead to a selective impairment of one language in
bilinguals (Gomez-Tortosa et al., 1995). Finally, more
evidence in favour of this hypothesis was found in electrical
stimulation studies. These studies showed that in
multilingual speakers, different languages may be disrupted
selectively (Black & Ronner, 1987; Ojemann & Whitaker,
1978; Roux & Trémoulet, 2002).

Recently, PET and fMRI have allowed a more direct
study of the neural representation of language in bilinguals
and polyglots. However, the pattern that emerges from these
neuroimaging studies is far from consistent. In some studies
(Dehaene et al., 1997; Kim et al., 1997; Perani et al., 1996;
Yetkin et al., 1996), at least partly different representations
for different languages were found. In other studies
(Hasegawa, Carpenter, & Just, 2002; Hernandez, Dapretto,
& Mazziotta, 2001; Illes et al., 1999; Klein et al., 1995) no
evidence was found that languages are represented in
distinct brain regions. In a few studies (Chee, Tan, & Thiel,
1999; Klein et al., 1999; Pu et al., 2001; Vingerhoets et al.,
2003), shared neural substrates were found (Van den Noort
et al., 2005b).
Evidently, more research is necessary before any firm
conclusions can be drawn. The pattern that emerges from
functional neuroimaging studies is far from consistent,
which can partially be explained by two major problems: 1)
Researchers use different kinds of experimental paradigms,
making comparisons between bilingual- and multilingual
studies very difficult. 2) The selection of the participants
differs. As a result, most of the differences that are found in
neuroimaging studies can be explained by differences of the
proficiency level, second language onset, and second
language exposure of the bilingual- and multilingual
participants (Indefrey, to appear). Nevertheless, there are
reliable differences between the hemodynamic activation
patterns observed during L1 and L2 language processing,
but only for subgroups of bilingual speakers and
predominantly in the direction of stronger activation during
L2 processing (Abutalebi, Cappa, & Perani, 2001; Indefrey,
to appear; Stowe & Sabourin, 2005).

Structural Brain Changes
Inferior Parietal Region
Recently, structural MRI has been used for second language
research, as well (Van den Noort, Bosch, & Hugdahl,
2005a). It is important to note that structural MRI is not a

2293

competing technique; but must be seen as a useful
complimentary approach.
In a study by Mechelli et al (2004), voxel-based
morphometry (Ashburner & Friston, 2000; Good et al.,
2002) was used to investigate structural plasticity in healthy
right-handed English and Italian bilinguals. To test for
differences in the density of grey and white matter between
bilinguals and monolinguals, they recruited 25
monolinguals who had had little or no exposure to a second
language; 25 “early” bilinguals, who had learned a second
European language before the age of 5 and who had
practised it regularly since; and 33 “late” bilinguals, who
had learned a second European language between the ages
of 10 and 15 and practised it regularly for at least 5 years.
All volunteers for this test were native English speakers of
comparable age and level of education.
Voxel-based morphometry revealed that grey-matter
density in the inferior parietal cortex was greater in
bilinguals than monolinguals (Figure 1a). This effect was
significant in the left hemisphere (p < .05) and a trend was
also evident in the right hemisphere. Although increased
grey-matter density in the inferior parietal cortex was
common to both early and late bilinguals, the effect was
greater in the early bilinguals in the left and right
hemispheres. No other significant effects were detected in
either grey or white matter.
In addition, they (Mechelli et al., 2004) investigated
whether there was a relation between brain structure and
proficiency in the second language and age at acquisition.
Twenty-two native Italian speakers, who had learned
English as a second language when they were between 2
and 34 years old, were tested. Second-language reading,
writing, speech comprehension, and production were
assessed using a battery of standardized neuropsychological
tests. It was found that overall proficiency, as indexed by
principal component analysis, correlated negatively with age
of acquisition (p < .01; r = -0.855). Remarkably, voxelbased morphometry revealed that second-language
proficiency correlated with grey-matter density in exactly
the same left inferior parietal region (Z-score = 4.1; p < .05;
Figure 1b). In addition, grey-matter density in this region
correlated negatively with the age of acquisition of the
second language (Z-score = 3.2; p < .05; Figure 1c). There
were no other significant effects in grey or white matter.
The authors (Mechelli et al., 2004) have therefore
identified an increase in the density of grey matter in the left
inferior parietal cortex of bilinguals relative to
monolinguals, which is more pronounced in early rather
than late bilinguals, and have also shown that the density in
this region increases with second-language proficiency but
decreases as the age of acquisition increases. These effects
could result from a genetic predisposition to increased
density, or from a structural reorganization induced by
experience (Golestani, Paus, & Zatorre, 2002). Early
bilinguals probably acquire a second language through
social experience, rather than as a result of a genetic
predisposition. According to the authors, the findings
therefore suggest that the structure of the human brain is
altered by the experience of acquiring a second language.
Previous second language studies with fMRI had also

shown activation in the inferior parietal region during, for
example verbal-fluency tasks (Poline et al., 1996;
Warburton et al., 1996). The results that Mechelli et al.
(2004) presented are consistent with growing evidence that
the human brain changes structurally in response to
environmental demands as a function of learning in domains
other than language (Draganski et al., 2004; Maguire et al.,
2000). Mechelli et al. (2004) therefore concluded that the
relationship between grey-matter density and performance
that was found in their study could be an example of a more
general structure-function principle that extends beyond the
domain of language.

The Corpus Callosum
The corpus callosum is another area, in which structural
differences between monolinguals and second language
learners were found (Coggins, Kennedy, & Armstrong,
2004). What could be the role of the corpus callosum in
second language acquisition? (Van den Noort et al., 2005b)
In response to second and/or third language acquisition
and use, the human brain undergoes cortical adaptation to
accommodate multiple languages either by recruiting
existing regions used for the native language, or by creating
new cortical networks in distinct adjacent areas of the cortex
to handle certain functional aspects of L2. However,
regardless of how the cortex organizes the circuitry required
to handle multiple languages, all non-reflexive behaviour,
including cognition and communication, is normally the
result of unconscious and seamless coordination of activity
between both hemispheres via the cerebral commissures
(Coggins et al., 2004). The corpus callosum is the main
fiber tract that connects the two brain hemispheres, which
consists of approximately 200-350 million fibers in humans
(Aboitiz et al., 1992a, 1992b; Nolte, 1998; Thompson et al.,
2002).
Previous research has shown that fibers from the
language areas in the superior temporal gyrus (Wernickes’
area, planum temporale) pass through the isthmus of the
corpus callosum (see Figure 2) (Von Plessen et al., 2002). In
addition, Dimond, Scammell, Brouwers, and Weeks (1977)
found that the body of the corpus callosum is also
specifically involved in language processing. A prominent
growth in the language cortex itself was found as well,
suggesting a key maturational phase in brain regions that
support the learning of new languages.
So far, only one study has been done on corpus callosum
variability between monolinguals and bilinguals. In this
study, nineteen right-handed adult males and females
participated. There were twelve bilingual and seven
monolingual participants and they were all teachers. All
bilingual participants reported to possess advanced to
superior levels of proficiency in the L2 according to the
established ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines (American
Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages, 1983). The
average age of the bilingual teachers was 38 years (range
25-57); there were 7 females and 5 males. The seven
monolingual teachers who participated reported no previous
study of a second language and their average age was 45
years (range 29-59); there were 5 males and 2 females.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the procedure used
in this study to produce images of the corpus callosum. A
midsagittal section of the corpus callosum was imaged and
used for this study. Using a modification of Witelson
(1989), the midsagittal corpus callosum image was
partitioned plane into five subregions (Figure 2) (Coggins et
al., 2004).

Figure 2: Regional subdivision of the midsagittal corpus
callosum. Region 1, anterior third; Region 2, anterior
midbody; Region 3, posterior midbody; Region 4, isthmus;
Region 5, splenium. Adapted from (Coggins et al., 2004).
The preliminary findings of this study showed
significant differences in the corpus callosum between the
monolingual and the bilingual groups. The anterior midbody
to total corpus callosum midsagittal area ratio was
significantly larger in the bilingual individuals compared to
the monolingual individuals. This significance should,
however, be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample
size of the study (Coggins et al., 2004).
More data is needed to test if this difference in the
anterior midbody is reliable and to test if the larger posterior
midbody to total corpus callosum midsaggital area ratio and
the larger isthmus to total corpus callosum midsaggital area
ratio are significant if a larger sample size is used. Although
more data is needed, the first results seem to be in line with
the hypothesis that structural changes in the corpus callosum
are taking place during the process of second language
acquisition.

Evidence for a Critical Period?
Age of acquisition plays an important role in second
language acquisition. An “earlier is better” rule of thumb
captures the negative correlation between age of learning
onset and eventual asymptotic performance. A considerable
body of experimental data is consistent with this
generalization. Most of these studies offer a maturational
account of age effects and suggest that a critical period
limits both L1 acquisition and L2 acquisition (Birdsong &
Molis, 2001; Long, 1990).
If a critical period limits second language acquisition,
one would expect that linguistic performance should
correlate negatively with the age at which L2 learning
begins. Importantly, this effect should be observed in cases
where L2 learning begins prior to the end of maturation.
Moreover, there should be few if any late learners who
perform in the range of native controls. Finally, if limits on
attainment are maturational in nature, then they should
apply to L2 acquisition generally. Johnson and Newport

2295

(1989), proposed their maturational model of L2 attainment
based on these lines of reasoning (Birdsong & Molis, 2001).
Johnson and Newport (1989) used a grammaticality
judgment task in their experiment. A group of Chinese and
Korean learners of English participated in the study. The
results of the grammaticality judgment task were in line
with the maturational model of L2 attainment. Moreover,
Johnson and Newport argued that their results should
generalize to other L1 and L2 contexts. Although the
findings and interpretations of Johnson and Newport have
been widely accepted, there is also evidence against this
maturational account.
In some studies, postmaturational age effects were
found (Bialystok & Hakuta, 1994, 1999; Birdsong, 1992;
Flege, 1999). In other studies, significant numbers of late
learners were found, who perform like natives on various
linguistic tasks (Bongaerts, 1999; Cranshaw, 1997; Van
Boxtel, 2005).
To conclude, the controversy about the existence of a
critical period remains as intense as ever (Birdsong, 1999;
Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson, 2001; Marinova-Todd et al.,
2000; Scovel, 2000; Singleton, 2001; Van Boxtel, 2005;
Wartenburger, Heekeren, Abutalebi, Cappa, Villringer, &
Perani, 2003). Future structural- and functional MRI
research combined with good (psycho)linguistic research
could give important results with respect to this debate. In
addition, this research could give an answer on the question
whether the relationship between grey-matter density (for
example in the parietal region and the corpus callosum) and
second language performance is indeed only an example of
a more general structure-function principle that extends
beyond the domain of language as Mechelli et al. (2004)
suggested.

General Discussion
Many hypotheses exist about how second and/or third
languages are represented in the brain. The pattern that
emerges from functional neuroimaging studies is far from
consistent. This can partially be explained by the different
experimental paradigms that are used in the bilingual- and
multilingual studies and by the differences in onset,
proficiency, and exposure of the selected participants. So
far, reliable differences between hemodynamic activation
patterns during L1 and L2 language processing have been
observed, but only for subgroups of bilingual speakers and
predominantly in the direction of stronger activation during
L2 processing (Abutalebi, Cappa, & Perani, 2001; Indefrey,
to appear; Stowe & Sabourin, 2005).
Recently, structural MRI has been used for second
language research, as well. Are there any structural plastic
changes in the human brain during the process of second
language acquisition? Is there a specific (second) language
acquisition area? In this paper, data on functional- and
structural neuroimaging studies were presented to answer
these questions. First of all, it is important to note that only
two structural neuroimaging studies were conducted, so far.
The results of the structural neuroimaging study by Mechelli
et al. (2004) are consistent with growing evidence that the
human brain changes structurally in response to
environmental demands. Structure, is already known to alter

as a function of learning in domains other than language
(Draganski et al., 2004; Maguire et al., 2000). Mechelli et
al. (2004) conclude that the degree of this structural
reorganization in bilinguals is correlated with their second
language performance. The relationship between greymatter density and performance discovered in the study
conducted by Mechelli et al. (2004) could be an example of
a more general structure–function principle that extends
beyond the domain of language.
However, does this mean that there is no specific brain
area in which structural changes can be found during the
process of (second) language acquisition? The answer to
this question is not clear yet. At the end of this paper, we
discussed the possible role of another area, namely: the
corpus callosum, in which structural differences between
monolinguals and second language learners were found.
Previous structural neuroimaging research on the corpus
callosum (Thompson et al., 2000) showed that fibers from
the language areas in the superior temporal gyrus
(Wernickes’ area, planum temporale) pass through the
isthmus area (Von Plessen et al., 2002). Moreover, a
prominent growth in the language cortex itself was found,
suggesting a key maturational phase in brain regions that
support the learning of new languages. In addition, it was
found that the body of the corpus callosum is specifically
involved in language processing (Dimond, Scammell,
Brouwers, & Weeks, 1977).
So far, only one study on corpus callosum variability
between monolinguals and bilinguals was conducted. This
study showed that the anterior midbody to total corpus
callosum midsagittal area ratio was significantly larger in
the bilingual individuals compared to the monolingual
individuals (Coggins et al., 2004).
Future combined functional- and structural MRI
research on bilingualism/multilingualism should give a
better insight on the exact role of the inferior parietal region
and the corpus callosum, but also on the more specific
language areas in the process of (second) language
acquisition. Finally, this research could answer the question
whether; the relationship between grey-matter density and
second language performance is indeed only an example of
a more general structure-function principle that extends
beyond the domain of language. The other possibility is that
it is more second language specific.
