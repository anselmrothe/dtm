Abstract
Understanding how people recognize and match faces
is important in many real-world situations, including
policing, military, security and retail environments.
We investigate the effects of time pressure and additional task demands on face matching performance.
In a 2x2 factorial design—varying whether there was
high or low time pressure, and whether or not an additional task had to be completed—participants were
asked to judge whether each of a series of face image
pairs were of the same person. Large individual differences were observed. Recall was higher than precision,
and performance worsened under high time pressure
with the additional task. Learning effects within conditions were observed, and response times were generally independent of the decisions made. Some implications of these findings for applied environments are
discussed.

Introduction
Face matching is the process of verfiying the equivalence of two or more people on the basis of their facial characteristics. It involves visually perceiving a
face, and matching this face to a known individual or
identification image (Lewis & Edmonds 2003). Understanding how people match faces is an important issue
in cognitive science for both theoretical and practical
reasons. On the theoretical front, it involves studying
core cognitive representational and decision-making
processes with complicated natural stimuli. On the
practical front, understanding how people match faces
has application in areas such as policing, the military,
security, eyewitness testimony, social interactions and
biometric identification.
Previous research has considered the processes used,
and conditions under which, humans can remember,
match and recognize both familiar and unfamiliar faces
(e.g., Baudouin, Gilibert, Sansone & Tiberghein 2000;
Nagayama 1999; Shapiro & Penrod 1986). Through
focusing primarily on the effects of disguises, and
changes in appearance, race, and gender, past research
has highlighted that humans are often not very skilled
at recognizing unfamiliar faces (Burton, Miller, Bruce,
Hancock & Henderson 2001; Luckman, Allinson, Ellis
& Flude 1995; Shapiro & Penrod 1986). Other research

suggests that image quality (Bruce et al. 1999; Henderson, Bruce & Burton 2001; Inui & Miyamoto 1984;
Liu, Seetzen, Buton & Chaurdhuri 2003), illumination
and exposure time (DiNardo & Rainey 1991; Laughery, Alexander & Lane 1971), image colour (Bruce et
al. 1999; Yip & Sinha 2002), moving as opposed to
static facial images (Henderson et al. 2001; Kemp,
Towell & Pike 1997; Knight & Johnston 1997; Lander
& Bruce 2003) and distance and perspective (Hager &
Ekman 1979; Harrigan & Taing 1997) can also influence face recognition.
In operational environments, face matching tasks are
often performed repetitively over long time periods,
under strict time limits and processing guidelines, and
in conjunction with other related tasks. For example,
face matching tasks are often performed in banks, airports, retail outlets, for access to buildings or licensed
venues, and when obtaining official documents or producing proof of age or identity. It is an interesting
empirical question, therefore, how time pressure and
the need to perform additional tasks might affect face
matching performance. The present research examines
these issues.

Experiment
Method
Participants Thirty-one first year psychology students from the University of Adelaide and 17 members
of the general community were involved in the study.
The students received course credit for their participation. Of the 48 participants, there were 33 females and
15 males, ranging in age from 17 to 58 years (M=23.27,
SD=9.63).
Design A within-subjects design was used. Participants completed 400 trials, 100 under each condition
(high time pressure with additional task, low time pressure with additional task, high time pressure with no
additional task, low time pressure with no additional
task). Each condition included 90 ‘same face’ pairs
showing two images of the same person and ten (randomly distributed) ‘different faces’ pairs showing different people. Every participant viewed the same pairs

of images in the same order, with each face and each
face pair presented only once during the experiment.
The order in which participants completed the four
conditions was counterbalanced using a pseudo-Latin
Squares design. Thus, the order and presentation of
the images remained exactly the same for every participant: only the experimental condition in which the
participant viewed each face pair was varied.
Face Stimuli The face images were selected from
the FERET database (Phillips, Wechsler, Huang, &
Rauss 1998). The facial imagery in this database was
collected in the US between 1993 and 1996 and includes 500 greyscale images of human faces, most of
which are photographed several times with variations
of angle, expression, lighting or perspective, and some
with changes in hairstyle, glasses or clothing.
For the experimental stimuli, the first image selected
was a frontal pose with a regular facial expression (i.e.,
smiling or neutral). For ‘same face’ pairs, the comparison image was selected from the range of remaining
images of the same person, which usually involved a
slight alteration such as an alternative facial expression, quarter left or right pose, half left or right pose,
or profile left or right pose, or changes to lighting,
hairstyle, glasses or clothing. For ‘different faces’ pairs,
the comparison image was selected from those of different, but similar looking, people.

1676

Procedure Figure 1 shows the experimental interface. The first face is shown on the right hand side,
with the comparison face on the left. ‘Same’ and ‘different’ decision buttons are located between the faces.
An identification card, giving information on the surname, age, height, weight, city, postcode and two different identification numbers of the person, was located
beside the first face on the right hand side.
On every trial, a bar moving across the top of the
screen indicated the time remaining for the participant to make their choice. The high time pressure
condition imposed a time limit of six seconds, while
the low time pressure condition imposed a limit of 15
seconds. These values were determined on the basis of
pilot studies.
On every trial within an experimental condition involving the additional task, prior to making a ‘same’
or ‘different’ decision, participants were required to answer a question relating to the details on the identification card. The question was multiple choice, with five
different response options, and related (at random) to
one of the identification card fields. Participants were
required to answer the question correctly before proceeding to the face recognition, making their response
by clicking the button at the bottom of the interface
corresponding to the correct answer. There was a delay
of one second for each incorrect answer, to discourage
guessing.

Precision and Recall Decisions are naturally partitioned into four classes. ‘True accepts’ are correct
decisions that two faces are of the same person; ‘true
rejects’ are correct decisions that two faces are of different people; ‘false accepts’ are incorrect decisions that
two faces are of the same person, when in fact they
are of different people; ‘false rejects’ are incorrect decisions that two faces are of different people, when in
fact they are of the same person.
In the current context, where the interest is in people’s ability to detect that two faces are different, it is
useful to define indices of precision and recall relative
to ‘different’ decisions. Formally, precision is defined
as the proportion of true rejects relative to the total
of true rejects and false rejects, while recall is defined
as the proportion of true rejects relative to the total
of true rejects and false accepts. Intuitively, precision
measures the proportion of face pairs that were actually different out of those decided to be different, while
recall measures the proportion of face pairs decided to
be different out of those that actually were different.
In other words, precision indicates how accurately people find mismatched face pairs, while recall indicates
how thoroughly people find mismatched face pairs.
Because it was possible for participants to fail to
make a decision, two types of precision and recall measures are possible. Under a ‘stringent’ policy, nondecisions are regarded as ‘different’ decisions, while
under a ‘lenient’ policy, non-decisions are regarded as
‘same’ decisions. Intuitively, stringent conditions correspond to a scenario where guilt is presumed, and
face pairs are regarded as different unless an explicit
‘same’ decision is made, while lenient conditions correspond to the assumption of innocence, with face pairs
regarded as the same unless an explicit ‘different’ decision is made. Accordingly, stringency emphasizes recall at the expense of precision, but leniency emphasizes precision at the expense of recall.
Figure 2 shows both stringent and lenient precision
and recall performance for every participant in every
condition, as well as aggregated performance across all
participants in each condition. Stringent measures are
represented by crosses, while lenient measures are represented by circles. Aggregate measures are shown in
bold. The most striking feature of Figure 2 is that
there are large individual differences in performance,

Testing sessions were held in a designated computer
room at various times over a period of two weeks. An
example screen shot, similar to Figure 1, displaying images that were not used in the experiment, was shown
to participants to familiarize them with the experimental interface. This was accompanied by a detailed verbal explanation. Participants were asked to respond
as quickly and accurately as possible, and the whole
procedure took 30 to 60 minutes.

even in the condition with low time pressure and no
additional task, and the variation across individuals increases with greater time pressure or the introduction
of the additional task. It is clear that recall performance is generally better than precision performance,
and it is noteworthy that, even with low time pressure and no additional task to perform, not a single
participant made all decisions correctly.
In terms of the aggregate measures of precision and
recall, Figure 2 suggests that performance across the
four conditions is remarkably similar. This conclusion
is borne out by Table 1, which shows the aggregate precision and recall measures, together with ranges corresponding to 95% confidence intervals. These confidence intervals generally overlap one another across
conditions, except for the condition with high time
pressure and an additional task. In this case, precision and recall measures diverge depending on whether
a stringent or lenient policy is adopted. This finding
suggests that there are relatively greater number of trials in the final condition where no decision was made.
Non-Decisions Table 2, which shows the total number of non-decisions in each condition, confirms this
intuition. There were more than twice as many nondecisions in the condition with high time pressure and
the additional task. Table 2 also partitions the nondecisions into those involving ‘same face’ versus ‘different faces’ pairs. Recalling that there are 90 ‘same
face’ pairs and only 10 ‘different faces’ pairs in each
condition, the percentages provide the most useful account of any potential differences. While the percent-

ages are all low in the first three conditions, and so
both ‘same face’ and ‘different faces’ pairs have similar
performance, there seems to be a clear difference in the
condition with high time pressure and the additional
task. In this condition, more than 14% of ‘different
faces’ pairs resulted in no decision, compared to only
about 2% for the ‘same face’ pairs.
Response Times An analysis of response times is
provided in Figure 3, which shows the distributions
for true accepts, true rejects, false accepts and false
rejects in all four conditions. In the condition with
low time pressure and no additional task, the majority of participants responded in approximately three
seconds, with few participants taking more than five
seconds. Under the high time pressure condition, participants responded slightly faster, particularly for true
accepts; the majority of responses being made between
one and three seconds. Response times lengthened in
the low time pressure with task condition, but still
rarely exceeded ten seconds.These results indicate that
even when extra time was available for participants to
view the faces, it was not used. Interestingly, there do
not generally seem to be large differences in response
time distributions between the correct and incorrect
decisions, or the accept and reject decisions. The only
possible difference might be slightly faster responding
for true accepts in some of the conditions.
Figure 4 shows how total response times were divided between the additional task and the face matching decision, for the condition with low time pressure.
It is clear that the additional task took at most nine
or ten seconds for almost all trials, leaving five or six

seconds to make a face matching decision. This means
participants had about the same available time to complete the face matching decision task as they did in the
condition with high time pressure but no additional
task. The extremely similar precision and recall measures in these conditions (i.e., low time pressure with
task and high time pressure without task), therefore,
suggests that participants were not able to attend to
the information relevant to the face matching decision
while completing the additional task.
Learning Figure 5 shows the stringent and lenient
recall and precision scores for the first 50 trials in each
condition, compared to the last 50 trials. From the first
to second half, all of the measures move upwards and to
the right for all conditions. This means that precision
and recall scores either remained stable or improved
from the first to the second half trials in each condition, under both policies. The consistent improvement
suggests a learning effect, where participants were able
to adapt over time and familiarize themselves with the
demands of each specific condition. It is also worth
noting that improvement was greatest in the two conditions with high time pressure.

Face Properties There were large variations in the
type and characteristics of the facial images that produced recognition errors. For example, 87% of the 400
face pairs used in the experiment produced at least one
error. The three face pairs that produced the highest
number of false reject errors used two facial images
of the same person with either a change in hairstyle,
clothing, glasses or pose. It is also interested to note
that the two face pairs producing the highest number
of false accept errors displayed the facial images of four
different people of African-American appearance.

mance, the introduction of increased time pressure or
an additional task had little overall effect on performance. Only when both were combined did performance deteriorate further, largely as a result of an increased number of non-responses, particularly for face
pairs that displayed the images of two different people.
The decisions associated with the different face stimuli are consistent with previous literature highlighting
that recognition performance decreases with particular
changes in appearance (Kemp et al. 1997; Luckman et
al. 1995; Patterson & Baddeley 1977; Terry 2001).
Since the majority of participants were Caucasian, the
errors on African-American face pairs is also consistent with the previously reported own-race effect for
face recognition (e.g., Furl, Phillips & O’Toole 2002),
which suggests that people are better at recognising
faces of their own race because they are more familiar with them, through every-day social interactions
(Elliott, Wills & Goldstein 1973).
In applied settings, it seems unlikely the levels of
performance observed in our experiment would be acceptable. As a result, these findings have significant
implications for the design of new training solutions,
or changed work practices to enhance face recognition
performance in these environments. The performance
found in the current experiment may provide justification for the introduction of automated face recognition
biometric technologies (Burton et al. 2001; Hancock,
Bruce & Burton 1998; Luckman et al. 1995).
Beyond the general findings, one of the most striking results is the presence of large individual differences
in performance. Participants ranged from performing
almost perfectly, to having recall or precision at or

Discussion
In operational environments involving face matching,
both recall and precision are important. High recall is
vital to insure mismatched pairs are identified to prevent unlawful entry or access to an area, and precision
is important to insure that there are few false alarms
to prevent inconvenience, and minimize resources and
transaction time. Neither recall nor precision were
emphasized as the better measure to optimize in our
experimental instructions, but participants clearly focused on recall over precision. That said, overall performance was unimpressive in even the most generous
condition (i.e., low time pressure and no additional
task) with a recall of about 90% and a precision below
50%. This means, even under these conditions, 10%
of mismatched faces remained undetected, and over
half of the faces that were rejected by participants as
different, were in fact the same. These failures seem
unlikely to be due to the 15 second time limit, since
most decisions were made in less than half that time.
Indeed, starting from this low initial level of perfor-

1679

below 50%. This strongly suggests that some people
are better at face matching than other. Theoretically,
it would be a worthwhile exercise understanding the
nature of these differences. They could relate to representation, decision-making, or some other combination
of basic cognitive processes. Practically, the observed
differences highlight the importance of careful assessment in recruiting for applied environments if human
decision-making is relied upon for face matching.
Ultimately, understanding human face matching
performance, including individual differences, will require the development of cognitive models. Some of
our results provide useful guidance about the form of
candidate models. One good example is the lack of obvious differences in response time distributions across
the decision types. If response times had been shorter
for the reject decisions than the accept decisions, this
would have indicated that participants were focusing
predominantly on the differences between the images
and were responding as soon as a sufficient degree of
difference was detected. Instead, the similarities in response times suggest that participants were assessing
both the features that were the same between each face
pair, and the features that were different. This type of
decision strategy is consistent with participants accumulating evidence directly in relation to both ‘same’
and ‘different’ decisions, and making a response once
either threshold is met, or an externally imposed time
limit is reached. This is essentially a sequential sampling process, of the type used extensively in other
areas of cognitive modeling (e.g., Vickers 1979). The
development of these and other models of human face
matching is a priority for future research.
