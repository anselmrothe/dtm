Abstract
In this paper we show that experience based beliefs are more
context sensitive than instruction based beliefs. The adaptation
to a new context happens faster and is more extensive with
experience based beliefs. Moreover we will demonstrate that
experience based learning is able to overrule what is learned by
instructions.
KEYWORDS: BELIEF REVISION, CONTEXT

Introduction
This research relates two subdomains of cognitive
psychology with an interest in belief revision that have been
studied completely separately in the past. On the one hand,
we rely on the reasoning literature regarding belief revision
(For a review, see Dieussaert & Schaeken, 2005). On the
other hand, we rely on the contingency learning literature
regarding belief revision (For a review, see De Houwer &
Beckers, 2002).
Both research domains have adopted a different strategy to
study belief revision. In reasoning research (e.g., Elio & Pelletier,
1997), participants (pps) are given a conditional statement (if
p, then q; e.g., if that bacteria is present in your blood, then
you have the Okro disease) and a categorical statement (p;
e.g., the bacteria is present), and are asked to deduce the
conclusion, or are given the conclusion (q; e.g., you have the
Okro disease) [belief construction phase]. Next, new
information that contradicts the conclusion is presented (notq; e.g., you do not have the Okro disease) [belief revision
phase] and pps. are asked to revise one of the former
statements in order to regain a consistent belief set [test
phase].
In most human contingency learning experiments (e.g.,
Catena et al., 2002), pps. receive information about a number
of situations in which certain Cues (C) and Outcomes (O) are
either present or absent, and they are asked to judge the extent
to which the presence of a C is related to the presence of O.
Three phases are discerned: first, a contingency is acquired
[belief construction phase], next it is extinguished [belief
revision phase]. The resulting ‘degree of belief’ in the C-O
contingency is tested in the third phase [test phase].
Additional manipulations of, for example, the acquisition and
extinction context influence the resulting degree of belief in
the contingency.
These differences in paradigm reflect a different view on
how beliefs are constructed: through instruction (if C, then O)
or through experience (several C-O trials). We consider both

forms of belief construction important since in daily life,
people construct their beliefs in various ways, depending on
the situation. Some beliefs are constructed through
communication (e.g., If you run out of brake oil, your brake
will not work) while others are constructed through
experience (e.g., If you eat, you won’t be hungry any more).
That experiences of the latter kind easily fit into an ‘if-then’
formulation has been shown before in Dieussaert et al.
(2001).
The predictions and outcomes of the studies in both
research domains are opposite. In reasoning research, the
main finding is that pps. revise their belief in the conditional
rule in favor of their belief in the categorical statement (e.g.,
for an explanation in terms of mental models, see JohnsonLaird et al., 2004). In contingency learning research, the main
finding is that when a change in context is introduced, the
primary belief in the C-O contingency becomes visible again
in the 3rd phase after being extinguished in the 2nd phase (e.g.,
Garcia-Gutierrez & Rosas, 2003). The latter phenomenon is
called ‘renewal’ (e.g., Bouton, 1993).
In a previous study (Dieussaert et al., 2005), we were able
to reconciliate both outcomes. We demonstrated that beliefs
induced by instruction, as applied in reasoning research, were
not sensitive to renewal, while beliefs induced by experience,
as applied in contingency research, clearly showed a renewal
effect. We showed this by comparing beliefs acquired
through instruction vs. beliefs acquired through experience
[belief construction phase]. The contradictive experience
based information was presented in the same context (AAA)
or in a different context (ABA) than the acquisition context.
Renewal only took place when the contexts had been changed
during the experiment and when the belief was induced
through experience.
Two explanations were proposed for this effect: “These
findings can be interpreted in various ways. On the one hand,
one could argue that beliefs acquired through instruction are
less stable and more susceptible to negative experiences than
beliefs acquired through experience. On the other hand, one
could also state that instruction based beliefs are less context
sensitive than experience based beliefs since no difference
between the AAA and ABA level is observed.” (Dieussaert et
al., 2005, p. 599).
In this paper, we sort out which of the two explanations
holds. In Experiment 1, we manipulate the context again, but
instead of giving the contradictive information through
experience, we will present it in an instruction format [belief
revision phase]. This will allow us to show that instruction

1233

based beliefs are not merely more susceptible to negative
experiences, but that they really are less context sensitive than
experience based beliefs. In Experiment 2, we will combine
instructions and experiences in the belief construction phase
(Experiment 2b) as well as in the belief revision phase
(Experiment 2a). This will provide us with convergent
evidence that the context sensitivity of experience based
beliefs is able to overrule the context insensitivity of
instruction based beliefs.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants
One hundred nineteen pps. took part in the experiment.
Seventy one first grade students at the University of Leuven
took part as a partial fulfilment of a course requirement and
48 high school students (age: ± 18) took part on a voluntary
basis. They were randomly assigned to the different groups.
Design
The within-subjects independent variable Phase consists of
three levels: belief construction, belief revision and test. A
judgment is given at each trial, followed by feedback. In the
belief construction phase, a C (present bacteria Verde) – O
(Okro disease) relation is taught through experience or
instruction. For half of the pps., this phase consists of 10 trials
with the following course: three experience trials (C – O), one
test trial (C – no information), two experience trials (C – O),
one test trial (C – no information), two experience trials (CO) and one test trial (C – no information). For the other half
of the pps. the belief construction phase consists of the
instruction that the statement ‘If the bacteria Verde is present,
the patient has the Okro disease’ holds and one test trial (C no information).

In the belief revision phase, pps. are instructed that the O
(Okro disease) does not follow from the C (bacteria Verde):
‘If the bacteria Verde is present, the patient does not have the
Okro disease’. This phase also consists of one test trial (C- no
information). In the test phase (1 test trial), the C-O relation is
tested (C- no information available).

The between-subjects independent variables are Belief
Construction Mode (BCM; explained above) and Context.
The belief revision phase is set in the same (Context A) or
another (Context B) context than the belief construction
phase. More specifically, the hospitals from which the patient
filing cards are taken is manipulated. See Figure 1 for a
visualisation of the design.
Material and Procedure
Pps. were instructed in written form. They were asked to
imagine being a researcher in a medical research institute,
who collected the filing cards of a lot of patients.
A computer program was developped with ‘AFFECT’1
software. It was run on standard PCs. Pps. were shown jpegfigures containing a patient filing card with the following
information:
- the name of the hospital (in a particular color for each
hospital)
- the result of a test on the presence of the yellow bacteria
'Amarillo'
- the result of a test on the presence of the green bacteria
'Verde'
- the result of a test on the presence of the pink bacteria 'Rosa'
If the result is positive, the bacteria are present. If the result
is negative, the bacteria are absent. All figures were equal: the
bacterias Amarillo and Rosa being always absent, the bacteria
Verde being always present.
It is the participant’s task to find out whether one of these
bacteria causes a newly discovered disease, ‘the Okro
disease’.
The pps. of the ‘BCM: Experience group’ received several
experience and test trials. They saw a filing card until they
marked the extent to which they believed a patient has the
disease on a seven point scale. On the scale, 1 indicates
‘certain the patient does not have the Okro disease’ and 7
indicates ‘certain the patient has the Okro disease’; 4
indicates ‘the patient may or may not have the disease’. Once
the participant had given the answer, (s)he received feedback
on the condition of the patient. In the experience trials the
feedback was ‘The patient has the Okro disease’. In the test
trials the feedback was ‘No information available! It is
unknown whether the patient has the Okro disease or not.’
The pps. of the ‘BCM: Instruction group’ received the
same filing card, with the following writing below: From
previous study of the filing cards, you know that if the
bacteria Verde is present, the patient has the Okro disease.
Afterwards, they were given one test trial.
In the belief revision phase, all pps. received an instruction
filing card followed by one test trial. Below the filing card,
the following was written: From previous study of the filing
cards, you know that if the bacteria Verde is present, the
patient does not have the Okro disease.

The context of the belief revision phase was manipulated.
For half of the pps., the hospital setting of the filing cards was
the same (AAA level), for the other half it differed (ABA
level) from the hospital setting in the belief construction
phase.
At the end of the experiment, all pps. were asked if they
noticed a context change during the experiment. This
question was added to make sure that only pps. who actually
noticed the context-change for ABA were included in the
analysis. The participant’s awareness of the context change is
a minimal requirement for him or her to take context into
account in determining the belief state.
Pps. were invited to ask questions if anything was not clear
to them. During the experiment, no questions were allowed.
Once the pps. started, they worked through the course of the
experiment in a self paced manner.

A planned comparison reveals that the interaction is even
more significant when we compare the last two phases
(revision and test): F(1,89) = 7.53, p <.01.

Discussion

Results

This experiment was set up as a follow up of a previous series
of experiments, in which we showed that instruction based
learning resulted in less renewal than experience based
learning. Two explanations for this effect were proposed (see
Dieussaert et al., 2005): 1) instruction induced belief is stable
and more susceptible to negative information or 2) instruction
induced belief is less context sensitive.
This experiment clearly provides evidence in favor of the
second explanation. Instruction induced belief does not seem
to be more susceptible to negative information, since renewal
takes place in the instruction-instruction groups. Instruction
based beliefs seem to be very context insensitive, since no
main effect of Context could be observed.
In Experiment 2a and 2b, we will go a step further in the
search to the power of instruction based versus experience
based beliefs. We will provide more evidence for the context
sensitivity of experience based beliefs, and we will show that
no more than a single experience is able to overrule the
context insensitivity of instruction based beliefs.

of the pps. the belief construction phase consists of the
instruction that the statement ‘If the bacteria Verde is present,
the patient has the Okro disease’ holds and one test trial (C no information).
In the belief revision phase, pps. experienced that the O

Context A

In this experiment we investigated whether the context
stability of an instruction is able to overrule the context
sensitivity of an experience, or vice versa.
We operationalised this question by manipulating the
BRM. Half of the pps. received a (negative) instruction
additional to the experience trials in the BRM.
The results confirm the context stability of instruction vs.
experience in the common set up. After 10 negative
experience trials in the belief revision phase, the belief in the
C-O contingency stays higher when the C-O contingency was
adopted by instruction than when it was adopted by
experience. However, this context stability fades away when
an instruction is added in the belief revision phase. The belief
in the C-O contingency is at an equal low level for the belief
construction through instruction as through experience.
The crucial indication that the context sensitivity of
experiences overrules the context stability of instruction lies
in the test phase: when returning to the original hospital
context A, the belief in the C-O contingency increases again.
If the negative instruction in the belief revision phase would

In the following experiment, we will tackle the same
question, but operationalised by manipulating the BCM.

Participants
Ninety eight new pps. took part in the experiment. Sixty pps.

patient filing cards are taken is manipulated. See Figure 5 for
a visualisation of the design.
Material and Procedure
See Experiment 2a.
The pps. of the ‘BCM: Instruction group’ received only an
instruction. The pps. of the ‘BCM: Instruction+Experience
(InsX) group’ received an instruction plus one additional
experience trial.

Results
Twenty-four out of the 158 pps. did not answer on the context
question at the end of the experiment, or gave a wrong
answer. They were discarded from further analysis. Thus, 22
pps. from the Instruction-Experience, 44 from the InsXExperience, 27 from the Instruction-InsExp and 41 from the
InsX-InsExp group were included in the analysis. Table 3
shows an overview of the results.

three levels: belief construction, belief revision and test. A
judgment is given at each trial, followed by feedback. . In the
belief construction phase, a C (present bacteria Verde) – O

reaches significance: F(2,260) = 2.99, p =.05. No significant
three-way interaction is observed (p =.08). This interaction is
illustrated in Figure 6.
The left side of the figure are the data discussed in
Experiment 2a: Instructions loose context stability when an
instruction is added in the BRM phase. More striking is that
the instruction also looses context stability when one

(right side of the figure).
A planned comparison shows a difference between the

These theoretical findings have considerable implications
for both the reasoning research as well as the contingency
research. They should both be aware of the restrictiveness of
their findings due to the experimental paradigm they apply.

In Experiment 2a, we gathered indications that the context
stability of an instruction is overruled by the context
sensitivity of an experience. In Experiment 2b, we aimed at
finding converging evidence for this observation through a
different operationalisation. We manipulated the BCM. Part
of the pps. received a single experience additional to the
instruction in the BCM.
The crucial indication that the context sensitivity of
experiences overrules the context stability of instruction lies
in the belief revision phase: adding a single experience to the
instruction results in a decrease at that level. This means that
the additional experience is able to make the belief more
context sensitive.

General discussion
In this research we bring together two separately developped
lines of research, reasoning and human contingency research,
on the same topic: belief revision. In a previous paper
(Dieussaert et al., 2005) , we showed that the opposite
predictions of both research lines with respect to the final
belief state can be reconciliated by taking the methodology
for belief construction into account. We showed that the final
belief state of beliefs induced by instruction is significantly
lower than the final belief state of beliefs induced by
experience. This is exactly in line with the findings in
reasoning research: the final belief in the instructed
conditional statement lowers significantly after contradictive
information is presented (e.g., Politzer & Carles, 2001). It is
also exactly in line with the findings in contingency research:
the final belief in experienced C-O contingencies is not
affected by contradictive information presented in another
context (e.g., Vadillo et al., 2001).
In this paper, we provided an explanation for these
findings: experience based beliefs are far more adaptive to
context changes than instruction based beliefs, which are
rather context insensitive. We also demonstrated that when
instructions and experience are presented together, the
context sensitivity of the experience based beliefs is able to
