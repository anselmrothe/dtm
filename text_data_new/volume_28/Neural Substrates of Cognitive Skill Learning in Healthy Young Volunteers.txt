Abstract
In the present study, we investigated the neural
substrate related to the successful performance of cognitive
skill learning using one of the typical form of incremental
cognitive skill learning task, weather prediction task and FDG
PET in voxel-wise analysis. The successful performance of
weather prediction task was related with the high metabolic
level of bilateral frontal and superior temporal areas as well as
striatum. In the analysis in each learning period, the higher
performance of the early learning period showed a positive
correlation with metabolism of brain areas that are related
with working memory, but in the intermediate learning period,
frontostriatal connections are mainly involved. In the late
learning period, metabolic correlation of higher performance
was shown in brain areas that are related with automatic and
implicit generation of candidate for response. The results
suggest that despite apparent independence, multiple memory
systems may interact cooperatively to solve the given task.

Background and Purpose
According to recent studies, there is growing
consensus that multiple memory systems exist in the human
brain (Rolls, 2000; Tulving, 2002). The main memory
systems are declarative and nondeclarative memory systems,
the former is associated with medial temporal and frontal
regions and the latter is associated with basal ganglia, not
impaired by lesion to the medial temporal lobe structure and
frontal cortex (Knowlton et al 1994; Filoteo 2001).
Many cognitive neuroscience studies focus on double
dissociation between patient groups, suggesting that the
underlying neuronal substrate operates independently.
However, a number of evidence reports that the two
memory systems interact, even competition to produce
optimize behavior for given stimulation or tasks (Ashby
1998; Poldrack and Rodriguez, 2004; Maddox 2004).
Probabilistic category learning is dependent on the
nondeclarative memory system, assumed to be an
incrementally learned cognitive skill across many trials. The
striatal system is known to be involved in this learning,

several disease with dysfunction of this brain area can
impair the motor and cognitive skill learning as well as
categorization (Knowlton et al., 1996a, 1996b; Westwater,
Mc-Dowall, Siegert, Mossman, & Abernethy, 1998; Ashby
et al., 2003), but possibly different memory systems and
underlying brain structures are involved during initial
learning (Ashby et al., 1998, 2003; Ashby and Jeffrey 2005).
An earlier study demonstrates that during
probabilistic classification task, the frontostriatal system is
activated while hippocampus is inactivated across the
learning compare with a perceptual-motor control task
(Poldrack et al., 1999). This suggests that the striatum and
medial temporal structure interact during the course of the
learning. Although Poldrack et al. showed successfully the
time course of activation and deactivation of neural
substrate during learning of cognitive skill, the performance
related neural changes were can be differ. Recently Tulving
et al. (1999) have proposed a distinction between `what' and
`how' sites for neuroimaging data interpretation. What sites
refer to activation loci yielded by the classic subtraction
analysis, and their activity would reveal what the system is
doing. In contrast, how sites refer to those loci yielded by
brain/cognition covariance analysis, and their activity would
reveal how well the system is performing a given task.
In this study, we investigate brain region that
shows the metabolic correlation of performance level across
the learning using FDG PET and weather prediction task.

Participants
Eighteen right-handed healthy subjects (age, 24 ± 2
y; 10 females/8 males) underwent brain FDG PET and
neuropsychological testing. All the participants had no
neurological and psychological problems and informed
consent was obtained before participation. To confirm the

Knowlton et al. (1994). Responses were indicated to be
correct for any given trial if the outcome selected was the
outcome that was more strongly associated with the cue
combination appearing on that trial.
Prior to statistical analysis, all the images were
spatially normalized into the MNI standard template
(Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University,
Montreal, Canada) to remove inter-subject anatomical
variability. Spatially normalized images were smoothed by
convolution, using an isotropic Gaussian kernel with 16-mm
FWHM. The aim of smoothing was to increase the signalto-noise ratio and to account for the subtle variations in
anatomical structures. The count of each voxel was
normalized to the average count of the whole gray matter
with ANCOVA scaling in SPM 99. Simple correlation
analysis between regional glucose metabolism and cognitive
task performance was done by SPM99 in a voxel-wise
manner (P < 0.03, uncorrected k=100).

handedness and emotional state, a handedness inventory and
the Beck Depression Inventory were used.

Materials and Task
The procedure for the weather prediction task
followed that used by Knowlton et al. (1994). The task was
presented using a 15.1 inch plane monitor (in plain
resolution 2024 × 768 pixels). The task required participants
to decide which of two outcomes (rain or sunshine) will
occur based on the combination of four cues on each trial.
One, two, or three geometric shape cards appeared on the
computer screen, and the two outcomes were occurred equal
probability. There were 14 possible cue patterns; each cue
was associated with one of the two weather outcomes with a
fixed probability. Participants were instructed that they
would be seeing one to three cues on each trial, and they
should decide if the cues predicted sunshine or rain. The
cues appeared 5 seconds on the computer screen.
The participant indicated his or her choice by
pressing either the key labeled with a sun or rain icon on the
keyboard. These two keys were on the opposite sides of the
keyboard. If the response was correct, correct buzzer were
delivered. If the response was incorrect, incorrect buzzer
sounded. Then, the weather (sun or rain) corresponding to
the correct answer appeared on the screen above the cues for
2 sec. Without a response within 5 sec, the trial was
terminated, the incorrect buzzer sounded, and the correct
answer appeared above the cues for 2 sec (these missed
trials were not scored). Participants were allowed a short
break (1 min) every 50 trials. Immediately after the total
150 trials were completed, they were administered a self
report questionnaire that asked about the strategy of present
task

Results

PET scan

Weather prediction task
The result of weather prediction task was presented
in figure 1. The total hit rate was 63.9±7.3%. Across the
learning, the performance was increased; 58.1% in the first
block, 63.5±10.4% in the middle block, and 70.8% in the
late learning periods. The performance of each learning
periods showed significant differences (F=6.260, df=2, P
<0.01). There was a significant correlation between the hit
rates of first and intermediate learning periods (r= 0.49, P <
0.05). Based on the self report questionnaire that asked
about the strategy of the task, most participants not only
can’t develop the strategy for the task but also can’t find the
hidden cue-outcome occurrence probability.

Three-dimensional acquisition method was adapted
using a Phillips Allegro PET scanner. Static emission scans
were started 40 min after the bolus injection of 4.8 MBq/kg
FDG after at least 6 h fasting and continued for 15 min.
Transaxial images were reconstructed by means of a filtered
back-projection algorithm employing a 3D-RAMLA filter.
Before the emission scan, subjects underwent a 5 minutes
transmission scan for attenuation correction using a 137Cs
single-photon emitting point source. Scatter correction was
performed using the standard software as supplied by the
scanner manufacturer.

Analysis
The Total score of weather prediction task were
used for the evaluation of cognitive skill learning.
Additionally, the performance rate of the early, intermediate
and late learning periods of weather prediction task were
calculated to evaluate the performance changes according to
learning processes. Scoring followed the guidelines of

these regions are involved in weather prediction task (Figure

However, block analysis revealed that the
correlation pattern is different across the learning periods.
Increased regional brain glucose metabolism correlated with
high performance level of early learning periods in the right
superior fontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and right
inferior parietal lobule and supramarginal, posterior
cingulate and medial frontal gyri. The performance of
intermediate learning periods had the correlation in the
medial frontal gyrus, insula, middle temporal gyrus, and
inferior frontal gyri in the left and putamen, claustrum,
superior temporal and superior frontal gyri in the right.
Metabolic correlation was found in the bilateral cerebella,
posterior cingulate gyri and superior temporal gyri for
performance of late learning period (Figure 3, Table 1).

We identified the neural substrates that are related
with performance of cognitive skill learning. The successful
performance of weather prediction task was related with the
high metabolic level of bilateral frontal and superior
temporal areas as well as striatum. These results are in
agreement with a previous study showing frontostriatal
activation during the probabilistic categorization learning
(Poldrack et al., 1999). In the analysis in each block, the
higher performance of the early learning period showed a
positive correlation with metabolism of brain areas that are
related with working memory, but in the intermediate

learning periods, frontostriatal circuits are mainly involved.
In the late learning periods, metabolic correlation of higher
performance was shown in brain areas that are related with
automatic and nondeclarative generation of candidate for
response.
These results indicate that brain regions associated
with the explicit memory system are recruited in early
periods of nondeclarative learning procedure. Further, they
suggest that frontostriatal circuits are involved only in late
periods of nondeclarative learning procedure. These data
demonstrate that despite apparent independence, multiple
memory systems may interact cooperatively to solve the
given task.
