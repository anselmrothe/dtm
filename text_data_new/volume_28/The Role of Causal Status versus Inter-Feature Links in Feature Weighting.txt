configuration of features in an exemplar is consistent with
known causal relations of the category determines the
exemplar’s membership likelihood (e.g., Rehder & Hastie,
2001). For example, Rehder’s causal model theory (2003)
postulates that the likelihood that a category’s causal
network produces a given exemplar determines category
membership for that exemplar. Exemplars that preserve a
category’s causal links would be viewed as better category
members because they are more likely to be produced by the
causal laws governing the category than exemplars that
break such relationships. Using Rehder’s (2003) example,
an animal that does not fly and yet still builds nests in trees
would be less likely to be judged to be a bird than an animal
that does not fly and builds nests on the ground.
The two proposed mechanisms can make conflicting
predictions for category membership. To illustrate this, let
us consider again a category with X, Y, and Z, which forms
a causal chain of X→Y→Z. Now consider two exemplars:
one has Y and Z but not X (represented as 011) and the
other has X and Z, but not Y (101). The causal status
hypothesis predicts that 101 is a better member than 011,
because X should be weighted more heavily than Y.
However, 101 has two causal violations (X→Y and Y→Z
did not occur), whereas 011 has only one causal violation
(X→Y did not occur). Thus, the mechanism sensitive to
preserving inter-feature causal links would predict that 011
is a better member than 101.
Given that these two accounts for the role of causal
knowledge on categorization can at times produce opposite
predictions, it is important to understand which mechanism
is more primary under what circumstances. Recent studies
by Rehder and his colleagues (2003; Rehder & Hastie,
2001) found strong effects of inter-feature causal links in
some of their experiments, to the extent that the causal
status effect disappeared at times. (See the next section for
details.) Such results can be taken to question the validity of
the causal status hypothesis.
To the contrary, we argue that individual feature
weightings would be more crucial than weighting
determined by inter-feature relations. Consider a category
with just two prototype features, X and Y, where X causes
Y. There are four possible exemplars: 11, 10, 01, and 00.
The proposals make two conflicting predictions. First,
although 10 and 01 have the same number of causal
violations, the causal status hypothesis predicts 10 to be a
better category member than 01. This prediction is based on

Abstract
Studies have found that the causal status of features
determines what exemplars are considered good members of a
category (see Ahn & Kim, 2000). However, this causal status
effect was questioned in recent studies (Rehder, 2003; Rehder
& Hastie, 2001), because the preservation of causal links of a
category’s causal network was shown to play a significant
role. We demonstrate in this study that these results are
methodological artifacts arising from the use of unnatural
wording of category attributes.

Introduction
Categories are believed to include not just a catalog of
features, but also rich representations of the causal relations
between features (e.g., Carey, 1985; Murphy & Medin,
1985). Recently, a number of proposals were made to
specify the process of applying causal knowledge to
categorization. In particular, two mechanisms have been
proposed to describe how causal knowledge influences
goodness-of-exemplar judgments (e.g., Ahn, 1998; Rehder,
2003; Sloman, Love, & Ahn, 1998). The goal of the current
study is to re-assess the empirical support for each of these
feature-weighting mechanisms.
One proposal states that causal knowledge indicates a
feature’s causal status, which, in turn, determines each
individual feature’s weighting. Ahn and colleagues have
proposed in their causal status hypothesis that, with all else
equal, features which cause other features in the same
category are weighted more heavily than features that are
effects of other features (e.g., Ahn, 1998; Ahn, Kim,
Lassaline, & Dennis, 2000). Consider a hypothetical
category with three features (X, Y, Z), which form a causal
chain such that X causes Y, which causes Z (X→Y→Z). X
has the highest causal status, Y has the next highest, and Z
has the lowest causal status. Thus, the conceptual centrality,
or importance to the concept, according to the causal status
hypothesis, would be in the descending order of X, Y, and
Z. For instance, upon learning that Roobans’ eating of sweet
fruits tends to cause Roobans to have sticky feet, which tend
to allow them to climb trees, participants judged an instance
missing “eating sweet fruits” to be the least likely member
of Roobans, whereas an instance missing “climbing trees”
to be the most likely member of the category Roobans (Ahn
et al., 2000).
The second proposed mechanism states that whether the

values of features (see 0000 in Figure 1, “Ambiguous
version”). There are two reasons why this wording might
have inflated sensitivity to inter-feature relations.
First, the wording of “normal” could easily be
misunderstood as speaking to a high prevalence of the
feature within the category. Therefore, 0000 may have
been rated as a better category member not because it
preserves the links of the category’s causal network, but
because it is in all ways a normal category member. Indeed,
close examination of Rehder’s experiments indicates that
the more ambiguous the meaning of the “normal” value
becomes (e.g., when feature base-rates were not specified
such that “normal” can be thought of as a more
characteristic value), the weaker were the causal status
effects (Rehder, 2003, Experiment 2).
Second, by repetitively using the same wording “normal”
for 0 values for all four attributes, the inter-feature
correlations (or the lack thereof) became artificially salient
to participants. Consider the following 3 ways -- shown in 3
columns -- of representing a set of isomorphic exemplars.

Conventionally, 0’s and 1’s are used across all dimensions
as shown in the first column so that readers can easily notice
the correlated structure. In reality, however, a feature
represented by 0 in one dimension (e.g., 0 could equal small
for the dimension of size) is different from a feature
represented by 0 in a different dimension (e.g., 0 could
equal red for the dimension of color). The format used in the
third column reflects these variations by using different
numbers to represent four binary dimensions (e.g., 2 and 3
correspond to 0 and 1 for the first dimension, 5 and 8 to 0
and 1 for the second dimension). When such non-aligning
feature values are used, the correlated structure is much
more difficult to notice. Indeed, the sensitivity to feature
correlations in concept learning is notoriously difficult to
obtain (e.g., Malt & Smith, 1984; Murphy & Wisniewski,
1989; Ahn, Marsh, Luhmann, & Lee, 2002). Rehder’s
stimuli (2003) correspond to the second column by using
the wording “normal” for all the non-prototype values (i.e.,
0’s). It is easy to see that the violation of the correlated
pattern is more visible, compared to the third column. That
is, the sensitivity to inter-feature causal links could have
been unnaturally inflated in Rehder (2003; also in Rehder &
Hastie, 2001) due to the unusual wording.

essentialism: an essence is the deepest cause in a category
and the absence of a cause feature (i.e., a feature that is
closer to the essence in a causal network) signifies that the
exemplar might have a different essence (Ahn et al., 2000).
For example, an instance that flies without wings (01)
seems to imply a causal mechanism or an essence entirely
different from that of birds. Thus, exemplar 01 would be a
worse bird than an instance that has wings but cannot fly
(10). That is, not all causal violations are equal because a
violation due to a missing cause suggests the presence of a
different essence.
The second conflicting prediction concerns 00. Rehder
(2003) suggests that the fact that no causal relation was
violated in 00 serves as positive support for the exemplar
being a category member, increasing its membership
likelihood. However, a Chihuahua, which does not have
wings and does not fly (00), is a very poor “bird” although
it preserves the expected causal relation of the category (i.e.,
not having wings causes a Chihuahua not to be able to fly.)
If link preservation should figure more heavily than actual
feature presence, then a Chihuahua should be judged as a
more likely bird than a penguin, an exemplar that only has
one category feature and thereby breaks the causal
relationship instantiated in the category. In some sense,
treating 00 as a good member of a category appears to be
psychologically implausible, as is well illustrated in the
famous raven paradox: seeing green grass does not boost
our belief that all ravens are black (Hempel, 1945).
For these reasons, we argue that sensitivity to interfeature causal links is not likely to play the predominant role
in determining category membership. In the next section, we
discuss why previous results showing the effect of interfeature causal links appear to be due to the artificiality of
stimulus materials used in those experiments. We will first
describe Rehder’s (2003) experiments in detail, which serve
as the basic paradigm in the current study.

Causal Chain Structure
In Rehder (2003), participants first learned a category (see
Figure 1, under “Ambiguous version” for the sample
description for Kehoe ants). Participants in the causal chain
condition also learned inter-feature causal relationships
(F1→F2→F3→F4). After sufficiently studying the
category, participants judged the membership likelihood of
16 possible exemplars that can be formed from 4 binary
dimensions (e.g., 1111, 1000; see under “Item” in Table
1). Across three experiments, only partial support for the
causal status effect was found, but the effect of inter-feature
correlations was found to be consistently significant. For
instance, 0000 had no causal violations and was judged to
be a better category member than 0001, 0010, 0100,
and 1000, each of which had at least one causal violation.
Such results are at odds with the causal status effect (e.g.,
1000 possesses a causally central feature and should
therefore be rated higher than 0000.)
We argue that these results were obtained because of the
repetitive use of the wording “normal” for non-prototype

Common Cause and Common Effect
Rehder and Hastie (2001) taught participants common-cause
and common effect structures (see Table 1 for illustration)
rather than a causal chain structure. They found that in the
common effect condition F4, which was described as an
effect of F1, F2, and F3, was weighted much more heavily
than its causes, arguing that these results countered the
causal status hypothesis. The feature attributes used in
Rehder and Hastie (2001) were identical to Rehder (2003),
and therefore, suffer from the previously discussed wording

Figure 1. Sample stimuli used in the current experiment. The Ambiguous version was used in Rehder (2003).
(F1, F2, F3, and F4) were described. In the Ambiguous
version of the materials the feature descriptions were the
same as the ones used in Rehder’s studies in that each
feature was described as taking two possible forms: a
“normal” occurring form and a variant of that form. In the
Unambiguous version only the prototype value was given.
As in Rehder’s Experiment 2 (2003), which produced the
strongest results against the causal status hypothesis,
information about the base-rates of the characteristic
features was not provided to the participants in either
version of the stimuli.
Each cover story also described the causal relationship
between the features of the category. The causal
relationships could take one of three structures: F1 caused
F2, F3, and F4 (common cause condition); F1, F2, and F3
each caused F4 (common effect condition); or F1 caused F2,
which caused F3, which caused F4 (causal chain condition).
Sixteen test exemplars (all possible combinations of the
four binary attributes; see Table 1) were created for each
category. In the Ambiguous version, the absence of a feature
was described as the instance possessing a normal amount
of the given feature. In the Unambiguous version, the
absence of a feature was described as the opposite state for
the appropriate feature. (See 0000 of each version in Figure
1 for examples.) Note that using the opposite values in the
Unambiguous version can result in stronger causal
violations. For instance, upon learning that blood high in
iron sulfate causes a hyperactive immune system, an
exemplar that contains blood with normal levels of iron
sulfate and a hyperactive immune system would be less of a
violation than an exemplar that contains blood low in iron
sulfate and a hyperactive immune system. Thus, if people
value causal violations in membership judgments, the
Unambiguous condition is more likely to show this effect.

problems. For instance, the inter-feature correlations would
have been unnecessarily salient by the use of “normal”
values. However, there is an additional complication due to
the uniqueness of the common effect structure. As
acknowledged in Rehder and Hastie and demonstrated in
Ahn and Kim (2000), a common effect structure (assuming
a reasonably strong causal relationship) strongly implies
that the base-rate of the common effect (F4) be higher than
the base-rates of its causes (F1, F2, and F3): F4 is more
likely because it can be produced in a multitude of ways.
Even though the base-rates were initially specified to the
participants to be 75% in these experiments, the base-rate
implied by the given causal structure, coupled with the
repetitive presentation of the confusing wording of
“normal” values in the test exemplars, might have
encouraged participants to overlook the provided base-rates.
Instead, they might have utilized the base-rates strongly
implied by the common effect structure.

Experiment
To summarize, Rehder and his colleagues presented a
number of findings that apparently demonstrated sensitivity
to inter-feature causal links and insensitivity to the causal
status of individual features. We have argued so far that
these results were obtained due to the use of the wording
“normal” to represent non-prototype features. To
demonstrate that the previous findings were artifacts of
unnatural wording in the stimuli, the current experiment
utilized two stimuli versions: an Ambiguous version, in
which the absence of a feature was described as being
“normal” as in Rehder (2003), and an Unambiguous
version, in which the absence of a feature was described as
being the opposite state of the prototype feature. Figure 1
shows sample stimuli. Causal chain, common cause, and
common effect structures were examined.

Procedure

Materials and Design

At the beginning of a block participants were given a short
set of instructions that included the name of the category for
which they were about to make judgments. Participants then
proceeded to make judgments for the sixteen exemplars

Six categories and their causal structures taken from Rehder
(2003; Rehder and Hastie, 2001) were used. In the cover
story of each category, prototype features of the category

563

corresponding to that category. The top half of each
exemplar screen presented the cover story for the category,
the description of the four category features, and the outline
of the causal relationship between the features. In the
bottom half of the screen the information pertinent to the
exemplar for that trial was presented. First, the question “Is
this a [X]?” with the X replaced by the appropriate category
name was listed, followed by the four features found in that
trial’s exemplar. Participants answered the question by
entering on a keyboard a number on a scale from 0
(Definitely not an X) to 20 (Definitely an X). If a participant
neglected to provide a rating on an exemplar, the missing
data was replaced in the statistical analyses with the mean
value for that exemplar in that causal structure and version1.
All 16 test items pertaining to the same category (i.e., same
causal structure) were presented in the same block in a
randomized order. Upon completing one block, participants
proceeded to two more blocks, each corresponding to a
different category with a different causal structure.
Compared to Rehder (2003), one discernible procedural
difference was that causal background information was
available to participants during judgments, saving the need
for extensive training of category information. This allowed
participants to make judgments about three different
categories in three different causal structures without the
fear of confusing what features belonged to a category. As
shown below, the results from the Ambiguous version
replicated Rehder (2003) and Rehder and Hastie (2001),
ensuring that this procedural difference was not critical.
Counterbalancing the different orders of causal structure
and material type resulted in six experimental sequences.
Participants completed three blocks worded either in the
Ambiguous version (N=36) or the Unambiguous version
(N=36). Participants proceeded at their own pace. All
experimental procedures were conducted on an eMac using
the RSVP experimentation package. Yale undergraduates
completed the experiment either for pay or partial
fulfillment of a course.

individual participant within each causal structure type, and
the average weights are shown in Table 2.
Two general patterns emerged across the three causal
structures. First, greater weight was placed on individual
feature presence than link preservation for the Unambiguous
condition as compared to the Ambiguous condition, whereas
the three relevant links for a given causal structure were
weighted more heavily in the Ambiguous version than in the
Unambiguous version for all causal structures. Second, the
causal status hypothesis was supported in the Unambiguous
condition but not in the Ambiguous condition.

Causal Chain

Results

As shown in Table 1, the two versions led to quite different
patterns of results in the Causal Chain condition. For
instance, the mean ratings for 0000 were 71.0 in the
Ambiguous version, but only 7.1 in the Unambiguous
version. This difference is most likely due to the fact that in
the Ambiguous version, 0 values were described as
“normal,” making participants think that these feature
values had high base-rates in the category. Note, however,
that this inflated rating on 0000 in the Ambiguous
condition might have made it look as if participants were
highly sensitive to causal violations. For instance, in this
condition, 0000 was rated to be much higher than 0001,
0010, 0100, and 1000, each of which has at least one
causal violation. However, this was not the case in the
Unambiguous condition: 0000, although preserving all
known causal relations, was rated lower than any of the
other fifteen exemplars in the category.

We will first describe the results from the causal chain
structure, followed by the common cause and common
effect structures. The mean ratings for each exemplar in
each causal structure are presented in Table 1, separated by
version. To determine the impact of each individual feature
and inter-feature link on membership judgments, regression
analyses were completed, following Rehder and Hastie
(2001)2. Regression weights were calculated for each
1

For the 3456 judgments collected across all participants, 22 were
replaced using this method.

For each exemplar, four dummy variables representing the four
features were coded as +1 if the prototype value was present and -1
if absent. Six dummy variables representing the possible links
between pairs of features were coded as +1 if the two features
involved in the link were jointly present/absent and coded as -1 if
only one of the features was present. Table 2 shows regression
weights on the relevant causal links only.

structure received somewhat lower ratings compared to
0111 in the Ambiguous version of the common cause
structure (M=40.1), even when they both involve breaking
three links with the only difference being the causal status
of the missing feature.
In the Unambiguous version, however, the pattern
changed. The regression weight for F4 in the common effect
structure was somewhat lower (11.2) than F1 in the
common cause structure (13.2), reversing the direction of
regression weights reported in Rehder and Hastie (2001). As
discussed earlier, the common effect structure works against
the causal status effect because three independent causes are
capable of producing the same effect, and therefore, the
terminal effect of this network is more likely to occur than
any of its three causes. Despite this disadvantage, when the
Unambiguous version was used, 0111 in the common
cause structure (i.e., missing the common-cause feature)
received much lower ratings (M=45.9) than 1110 in the
common effect structure (i.e., missing the common effect
feature, M=60.3), t(35) = 3.08, p < .005.
In both common cause and common effect structures, as
in the causal chain structure, the regression weights on interfeature links were much higher in the Ambiguous condition
than the Unambiguous condition (all t’s > 3.29, all p’s <
.005), whereas the weights on individual features were
much higher in the Unambiguous condition than in the
Ambiguous condition (all t’s > 3.23, all p’s < .005).

In addition, causal status effects are present in the
Unambiguous condition, but not in the Ambiguous
condition. For the causal chain model, the causal status
hypothesis predicts that the most causally central feature
(i.e., F1) should be most heavily weighted, with a decrease
in weighting as centrality decreases. In the Unambiguous
condition, the mean ratings of 0001, 0010, 0100, and
1000, as well as the mean ratings of 0111, 1011, 1101,
and 1110 are in the ascending order as predicted by the
causal status hypothesis. Indeed, regression weights for
individual features from the Unambiguous version were
consistent with this prediction (Table 2). Individual planned
t-tests were carried out comparing the weight given to the
individual features of the causal chain. As predicted, the
regression weight for F1 was higher than any of the other
features (all t’s > 2.4; all p’s < .02). F2 was not weighted
more heavily than F3 (p = .70), but was weighted more
heavily than F4 (t(35) = 2.52, p < .02). Likewise F3 was
weighted more heavily than F4 (t(35) = 2.41, p < .03).
No such pattern was found in the Ambiguous version.
None of the individual feature weights were significantly
different from each other (all p’s > .6). Instead, more weight
was allotted to the preservation of inter-feature links than to
feature presence. The regression weights for each of the
features (F1 through F4) for the Unambiguous version were
significantly higher than those for the Ambiguous version
(all p’s < .0001). However, the weights for link preservation
tend to be higher in the Ambiguous version than in the
Unambiguous version: weights for the link between F1 and
F2, as well as the link of F3 and F4 were significantly
higher in the Ambiguous version (t’s > 3.64, p’s < .001) the
link between F2 and F3 was not significantly different
between the two conditions (p = .46).

Common Cause and Common Effect Structures
Rehder and Hastie (2001), after examining categorization
based on the common cause and common effect structures,
concluded that their results did not support the causal status
hypothesis. They stated, “In this study, however, the fact
that the common cause was a cause did not confer it any
additional importance above and beyond its centrality
[defined as participation in many causal relationships], as
indicated by the fact that across Experiments 1-3 the
average transfer categorization regression weight given to
the common cause (11.7) was slightly less than the average
weight given to the common effect (12.2)” (p. 349-350;
phrase in brackets added). Likewise, in the Ambiguous
condition of the current study, the average regression weight
given to the common cause (F1: 1.85) was lower than the
weight given to the common effect (F4: 6.56) (t(35) = 2.49,
p < .02), replicating their results. More specifically, 1110

in the Ambiguous version was given a mean rating that was
much lower (34.0) than other exemplars missing only one
cause feature (0111, 1011, 1101, M=73.1, 69.7, 69.9,
respectively; all t’s > 6.1, all p’s < .0001). Furthermore,

Discussion
In the current study, we tested an Unambiguous version
where prototype features were indeed described to be
typical of the categories and non-prototype features did not
share the same wording across features, thereby avoiding
unnaturally emphasizing correlations among features. Using
these more realistic stimuli, we found that participants’

structured. When the correlated structure of categories was
not artificially emphasized, and features used in causal links
were described as prototype features of a category, it was
found that individual features’ causal status, rather than
feature combinations, was the predominant determinant of
feature weighting.

membership likelihood judgments were based more on
individual features’ weighting as determined by causal
status than the preservation of inter-property links. The
support for the causal status effect was found even in the
common effect structure where the causal structure strongly
implied base-rates of features that could work in opposition
to the causal status effect.
Rehder (2003) claimed that the lack of clear causal status
effects in his experiments can be attributed to “participants’
not linking the root of the causal chain to the category’s
underlying causal mechanisms” and that explicit linking to
an essentialist cause was necessary to producing the effect
(p. 1155). Our results show that with more natural stimuli
as in the Unambiguous version, additional reinforcement in
essentialist beliefs was not necessary to obtain the causal
status effect.
As mentioned earlier, we believe that the Unambiguous
version was successful in producing causal status effects for
two different reasons. First, the Unambiguous version
indicated that the prototype features were indeed typical of
the categories (i.e., possessed higher base-rates.) Thus,
0000 was judged to be the worst member even though no
causal violation occurred. Second, by not using the same
wording “normal” for non-prototype features, we did not
inflate the salience of the correlated structures to the
participants. We believe both aspects of this manipulation
are critical for the following reasons.
If base-rate alone drove the observed differences between
the two versions, then the results of the current experiment’s
Unambiguous version would be predicted to replicate the
high base-rate manipulation used by Rehder in several
versions of his experiments (e.g., 2003, Experiment 1). In
these high base-rate conditions participants were told that
the causally active form of the feature was present in 75% of
category members. Unlike the current Unambiguous
condition, the results from this base-rate specification found
only partial support for the causal status hypothesis. We
argue that these results occurred because even with the high
base-rate information the non-prototype values were still
described as “normal” in the test exemplars, highlighting the
violation of the correlated category structure to the
participants.
Rehder and Hastie (2001) argued, “our more fundamental
criticism of proposals such as the causal-status hypothesis
and feature mutability is that they only consider the effect
causal knowledge has on the importance of individual
attributes. In contrast, a central contribution of the current
article is to demonstrate that causal knowledge affects
which combinations of attributes become acceptable to
category membership” (p. 350). While we are not entirely
denying the role of preserving inter-feature links on feature
centrality, the current study demonstrates that a strong case
for the role of inter-feature links has yet to be made using
stimuli that reflect the way in which natural categories are
