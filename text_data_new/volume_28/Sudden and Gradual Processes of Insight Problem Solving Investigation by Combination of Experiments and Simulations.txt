Abstract

ple screenshot of the task is shown in Figure 1. The display
consists of three slots, and in each slot a single digit rotates at
a speed that prevents the subjects from perceiving each digit.
A history data window indicates the instances of the past four
trials. The digit in the third slot is controlled by an unknown
rule (target rule). If the subjects find the target rule, then they
can predict the digit in the third slot. The mission of the subjects is to find the target rule and predict the digits in the third
slot.

The insight process is generally characterized by suddenly
finding a solution in problem solving. On the other hand, recent cognitive studies have indicated that the insight process
involves a gradual process of approaching the solution. In this
study, we investigated such bifacial characteristics of the insight process from the viewpoint of a hypothesis search process by psychological experiments, and tried to explain how
these characteristics arise using a computer simulation model.
In the computer simulation model, we assumed that the insight
process consists of two qualitatively different types of hypothesis search processes in which reinforcement and chunking
learning methods are used. The results of computer simulation models indicated that both sudden and gradual characteristics arose from the interaction of these processes in problem
solving.

Introduction
Bifacial Characteristics of the Insight Process
Insight problem solving is different from normal problem
solving in many aspects. In normal problem solving, we approach to a solution through incremental steps. On the other
hand, in insight problem solving, we meet an impasse because we use experiences of past problem solving as negative
factors and then suddenly find a solution (Metcalfe & Wiebe,
1987; Smith, 1995). In contrast to the sudden attainment of
a solution, the process of insight problem solving develops
through gradual steps. In this context, the insight process is
described from the viewpoint of mental constraint relaxation.
First, mental constraints arise from past experiences and the
structures of problems, and we meet an impasse because these
constraints prevent us from reaching a solution. Gradually
these mental constraints are relaxed. Therefore a search that
does not follow these mental constraints gradually increases,
and we reach a solution (Knoblich, Ohlsson, & Raney, 2001;
Suzuki, Abe, Hiraki, & Miyazaki, 2003).

Figure 1: Screenshot of discovery task used in this study.
Subjects are required to predict the digit in the third slot
after the two digits in the first and second slots stop rotating.
A series of the procedure, stopping the first and second slots
and then predicting and confirming the third digit, is called
a trial. A history data window below the three slots shows
the results of the past four trials as history data. The rules
reported in each trial by the subjects are called hypotheses,
which are proposed in the process of hypothesis formation
and testing.
This is a discovery task that requires insight. Therefore,
the task is manipulated to lead the subjects to find a sham
rule called a blocking hypothesis, which differs from the target rule. The target rule: “the third digit in the n-th trial is
determined by adding three to the third digit in the n-1th (previous) trial” with a vertical relation. The blocking hypothesis:
“the third digit is equal to the sum of the first and second digits” with a horizontal relation.
Subjects are required to predict the digit in the third slot
after the two digits in the first and second slots stop rotating.
In the initial eight trials, by controlling the first and second
digits, the third digit is consistent with the sum of the first
and second digits while maintaining the target rule existing
across the vertical row (see the example display in Figure 1;
this rule is confirmed as follows: 1 + 3 = 4, 6 + 1 = 7, 0 +
0 = 0, 2 + 1 = 3, 1 + 5 = 6 in each column, and a series of
4, 7, 0, 3, 6 from bottom to top in the third row). Therefore,
the subjects are guided to the blocking hypothesis with the
horizontal relation as a sham rule. After the first eight trials, a

Purpose
How can we systematically explain such bifacial characteristics of the insight process? The purpose of this study is to
construct a computational model for the insight process from
a viewpoint where it consists of both sudden and gradual processes. In this study, we attempt to understand the insight
process by conducting psychological experiments and using
computer simulations.

Insight Task
Overview
In this study, we proposed and used a discovery task that
asked subjects to find a rule for predicting a digit. An exam-

subjects begin to receive negative instances called negative
feedback that disconfirm the blocking hypothesis.

discontinue the third slot to confirm the hypothesis. Such hypothesis proposing and testing as a trial lasted for a maximum
of 55 minutes until finding the target rule.

Definition of Types of Hypothesis Spaces

We excluded eight of the twenty-four subjects because they
could not form a blocking hypothesis through the initial eight
trials or could not provide any fine eye movement data. In
this paper, we are only concerned with the results of the five
successful subjects who found the target rule (for details see
Terai and Miwa (2003)).

Results

The process through which subjects find the target is considered as a process of searching for a hypothesis space. A group
of hypotheses that have a common regularity constitutes a hypothesis space; therefore the target rule and the blocking hypothesis belong to different problem spaces. In this study, the
relation between hypotheses and hypothesis spaces is defined
as follows.

Transition of Proposed Hypotheses Figure 2 shows the
transition of the proposed hypotheses in successful subjects.
The horizontal axis indicates the number of trials, and the vertical axis indicates each type of hypothesis and the hypothesis
space described above.
Figure 2 shows that all successful subjects found the blocking hypothesis by the time they reached the ninth trial. After
the ninth trial, the subjects began to receive negative instances
for the blocking hypothesis, proposing other hypotheses than
the blocking hypothesis. However, hypotheses that existed
outside of the blocking hypothesis space were almost never
proposed, confirming that the subjects continued to search for
the blocking hypothesis space. This result indicates that the
subjects had encountered an impasse. Figure 2 shows that the
discovery of the target rule seemed to occur suddenly from
the state where subjects were searching for the blocking hypothesis space, rather than by a gradual shifting through potential hypothesis spaces.

Blocking Hypothesis Space A set of hypotheses characterized by a horizontal relation is defined as a blocking hypothesis space.
Blocking Hypothesis: as described above.
Horizontal Hypotheses: rules characterized by a horizontal
relation other than the blocking hypothesis.
Target Space A set of hypotheses characterized by a vertical relation is defined as a target space.
Target Rule: as described above.
Vertical Hypotheses: rules characterized by a vertical relation
other than the target rule.
In addition to these hypotheses, subjects reported hypotheses characterized by both horizontal and vertical relations,
which are involved neither in the blocking hypothesis space
nor in the target space, such as the same digits arranged diagonally.

In psychological experiments, we requested subjects to solve
the discovery task as described above and analyzed the process of the subjects stumbling into insight.

Proposed Hypothesis and Hypothesis Search
The subjects repeated the following procedures to find the
target rule. First, they predicted the digit in the third slot by
proposing a hypothesis (we call this process hypothesis proposal), and second they stopped the third slot to confirm this
hypothesis. In this study, we captured hypothesis proposals
by using subjects’ verbal reports.
However, verbalized hypotheses do not indicate all hypotheses searched by the subjects. A hypothesis search phase
of searching for a huge variety of hypotheses, that is, a phase
of seeking various possibilities, would probably exist until
a hypothesis is proposed by the hypothesis proposal phase.
In this study, such non-verbalized hypothesis search in solving the task became apparent by capturing subject eye movements. For example, searching for the blocking hypothesis
space is identified from horizontal eye movements and the
target space from vertical eye movements.

Transition of Hypothesis Search Next, we analyze the
process of subjects searching for hypothesis spaces leading
to finding the target rule by using their eye movement data,
which were obtained as transition patterns of the fixation of
eye movement.
The transition of the horizontal and vertical eye movements
of successful subjects is shown in Figure 3. The horizontal
axis shows the number of trials: the first nine trials, three
trials after negative feedback was given, and four trials before
and after the target rule was discovered. The vertical axis
indicates the ratio of each type of eye movement to all types
of eye movement (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and fixed).
Figure 3 shows that the horizontal eye movement, corresponding to search for the blocking hypothesis space, domi-

manner of search: how subjects search for the experimental
stimulus of the task and obtain data from it.
On the other hand, numerical relation corresponds to a numerical rule existing among data involved in the sequence of
data. In this case, the numerical relation is “addition.” This
attribute corresponds to numerical knowledge retrieved from
the long-term memory of the subjects.
In this study, we captured the insight process by focusing
on the searching hypothesis spaces. The attribute that corresponds to search for hypothesis space is sequence of data;
therefore in the following, we focus only on sequence of data.

Adaptive Process The adaptive process performs hypothesis formation using reinforcement learning. Patterns of
sequence of data that constitute hypotheses are learned as obtaining data behaviors in reinforcement learning. To be more
precise, the model forms hypotheses based on both the sequence of data obtained from reinforcement learning and the
numerical relation retrieved from the long-term memory that
satisfy sequence of data. In the adaptive process, obtaining
data behavior from the stimulus of the task changes based on
the experiences of confirmation or disconfirmation of the hypotheses.

groups.

Summary
In psychological experiments, we captured the transitions of
hypothesis search and hypothesis proposal in the process of
hypothesis formation and testing by using subjects’ verbal reports and eye movement analysis. From the viewpoint of the
former, regarding their hypotheses as hypothesis proposal,
the discovery of the target rule seemed to occur suddenly
from falling into an impasse. On the other hand, the analysis
of subject eye movement as hypothesis search revealed that
searching hypotheses gradually varied with the development
of problem solving after negative feedback was given.

Knowledge Driven Process In the adaptive process, a
generated hypothesis is gradually adopted based on the success or failure of forming hypotheses. On the other hand,
in the knowledge driven process, past experiences are exploited as chunks to form hypotheses. Chunks are successful instances in the adaptive process: in this case, particular
sequence of data patterns. For example, when a hypothesis
is formed using data acquired in a sequence of “slot 1, slot
2, slot 3” and confirmed repeatedly in the adaptive process,
this sequence of data is extracted as a specific pattern, i.e., a
chunk, that will be exploited in the knowledge driven process.
In the adaptive process, when such data acquisition patterns become ineffective in hypothesis formation, the patterns
cannot be kept by relearning because learning the obtaining
data behavior is probabilistic. By contrast, chunks correspond
to specific patterns of data acquisition, such as obtaining data
from horizontal or vertical directions, and so on. Thus, once
a data acquisition pattern is learned as a chunk, then this pattern is maintained even if it becomes ineffective in hypothesis
formation.

Computer Simulation Model
Process of Insight Problem Solving as a Hybrid
Model
The suddenness and gradualness of insight problem solving are confirmed through psychological experiments in this
study. In this section, we explain how such bifacial characteristics of the insight process arise by using a computer simulation.
In our model we assumed that the insight process consists
of two different processes. One tries to form hypotheses by
exploiting past experiences. This process is called the knowledge driven process in this model. Another tries to form hypotheses according to feedback from the environment. This
process is called the adaptive process in this model. In this
study, we will explain the bifacial characteristics of the insight process as a phenomenon arising from interaction between the adaptive process and the knowledge driven process.

Interaction Between the Adaptive Process and the Knowledge Driven Process The adaptive process and the knowledge driven process interact with each other in interactions
that consist of bottom-up and top-down learning. The former corresponds to extracting chunks that develop from the
adaptive process to the knowledge driven process. Top-down

learning corresponds to adjusting the parameters of reinforcement learning that develop from the knowledge driven process to the adaptive process.
Hypothesis Search and Hypothesis Proposal The rule
discovery process consists of hypothesis search and hypothesis proposal. Hypothesis search is carried out through the
adaptive process and the knowledge driven process as described above. The model searches for hypotheses while alternating between the two processes that occur in a certain
probability. When an appropriate hypothesis is discovered
in hypothesis search, hypothesis proposal, which follows hypothesis search, proposes this hypothesis as output, and the
model moves to the next trial after discontinuing the third
slot. On the other hand, if an appropriate hypothesis is not
discovered in hypothesis search, then knowledge driven process proposes a hypothesis as output that was formed using a
chunk.

Figure 4: Models’ performances of discovering the target
rule.
Insight Task Figure 4 shows that when solving the insight task, the performance of the random model is the highest; second is the adaptive model, and the worst is the hybrid
model. In the adaptive model, performance apparently decreases more than in the random model because, when this
model found the blocking hypothesis in the initial eight trials,
an invalid sequence of data constituting this hypothesis was
reinforced. Furthermore, in the hybrid model, performance
also apparently further decreases because a chunk, blocking
the discovery of the target, was formed due to finding a blocking hypothesis.

Computer Simulations
We used three alternative models and two different tasks to
estimate the validity of these models in computer simulations.
Models The hybrid model is as described above. As an insight model we compared it with both the adaptive and random models to indicate the validity of the hybrid model. The
adaptive model is a model in which the knowledge driven process in the hybrid model is replaced by the adaptive process;
in other words, this model forms a hypothesis by only using reinforcement learning. In the random model, both the
knowledge driven process and the adaptive process in the hybrid model are eliminated; data acquisition and hypothesis
formation are performed randomly.

Non-insight Task By contrast, when solving the noninsight task this pattern is reversed. For the non-insight task,
the performance of the hybrid model is the highest; second
is the adaptive model, and the worst is the random model. In
the non-insight task, apparently the experience of discovering
the blocking hypothesis by the eighth trial, where the target
rule exists in the same problem space as the blocking hypothesis space, which facilitated the discovery of the target rule;
in the hybrid model, a chunk was learned from this experience that worked effectively. Although learning also occurs
in the adaptive model, its performance is lower than the hybrid model because relearning occurs whenever hypotheses
are disconfirmed, increasing the search for other hypothesis
spaces more than the blocking hypothesis space. The performance of the random model was the lowest because it does
not learn.

Tasks We used two tasks, insight and non-insight, to estimate the three models above and to indicate the validity of
the hybrid model as an insight model.
The insight task was identical to the task used in the above
psychological experiments. On the other hand, the noninsight task was constructed to allow the blocking hypothesis
and the target rule to exist in the same hypothesis space. The
blocking hypothesis in the non-insight task is identical to that
in the insight task. The target rule is, “the third digit is consistent with the sum of the units’ and tens’ digits of the addition
of the first and second slots.” For example, when the first and
second slots are nine and eight, the third slot becomes eight
as an addition of seven (i.e., the units’ digit) and one (i.e., the
tens’ digit).

Hypothesis Search and Hypothesis Proposal It is confirmed that the performance of the hybrid model for the insight task decreased as well as in the above psychological
experiments. Next, we focus on the process of searching for
hypothesis spaces and proposing hypotheses in each model
that solves the insight task.
Figure 5 shows the transition of the hypothesis search and
the proposed hypotheses in each model solving for the insight task. The transition of the hypothesis search indicates
a change in the formed hypothesis in the hypothesis search
phase. This data correspond to the psychological data captured using eye movement analysis in the psychological experiments. The transition of proposed hypotheses indicates
the change of an output hypothesis in the hypothesis proposal
phase. This data correspond to the psychological data captured by subject verbal reports in psychological experiments.
In the results of the transition of the hypothesis search (Figure 5 (a)), the horizontal axis shows the number of trials that

Results
Performances of Models Figure 4 shows the ratio of discovering the target rule by the fortieth trial where each model
solves two types of experimental tasks. Each ratio is the
average of discovering the target rule, calculated through
one thousand simulations. The performances of the random
model were the same when solving either the insight task or
the non-insight task. This happened because the difference
in the structures of the two tasks did not influence the performance of discovering the target rule since the hypothesis
search was performed randomly in the random model. Thus,
the random model can be considered a model in the control
condition.

indicate the first nine trials, the following three trials after
negative feedback was given, and the three trials before and
after the target rule was discovered. The vertical axis indicates the ratio of the number of hypotheses searched for in
each hypothesis space in the hypothesis search process to the
number of hypotheses searched for in all hypothesis spaces.
In the results of the transition of the proposed hypotheses
(Figure 5 (b)), the horizontal axis uses the same measurement
as Figure 5(a); the vertical axis indicates the ratio of the number of hypotheses proposed in the hypothesis proposal phase
to the number of all proposed hypotheses.
In the hypothesis proposal, it is confirmed that each model
found the blocking hypothesis through the initial eight trials.
Next we will discuss the behaviors of each model after negative feedback was given.

This similarity was also observed in the behavior of the random model.
Hybrid Model On the other hand, the hybrid model
showed a qualitatively different pattern from those shown by
other models. In the hypothesis search, after negative feedback was given, searching for the blocking hypothesis space
gradually decreased. As for the hypothesis proposal, hypotheses were proposed while being fixated from the blocking hypothesis space even after negative feedback was given,
confirming that the discovery of the target rule occurred suddenly. This means that the hypothesis proposal pattern was
relatively different than the hypothesis search pattern.

Summary
The bifacial characteristics of insight process, gradualness
in hypothesis search and suddenness in hypothesis proposal,
were confirmed by the hybrid model through computer simulations. These results imply that such bifacial characteristics
of the insight process arise from the interaction between the
adaptive process and the knowledge driven process.

Random Model After negative feedback was given,
searching for the blocking hypothesis space drastically decreased, and the model moved to a random search. Correspondingly, in the hypothesis proposal, the random model
proposed a wide variety of hypotheses without fixating on a
search for the blocking hypothesis space.

Discussion
In this section, we discuss the elements that characterize insight: fixedness and suddenness/gradualness in the insight
process.

Adaptive Model After negative feedback was given,
searching for the blocking hypothesis space gradually decreased. Correspondingly, in the hypothesis proposal, other
hypotheses than those in the blocking hypothesis space increased. The transition pattern of hypothesis search is almost
identical to the hypothesis proposal in the adaptive model.

Fixedness
In psychological experiments, after negative feedback was
given, although searching for hypothesis spaces gradually

Weak Constraint: This constraint appears in hypothesis formation based on reinforcement learning in the adaptive process.

critical for adapting to environments in parallel while exploiting past experiences. Our computer simulations demonstrated that suddenness and gradualness in the insight process
arise from these two constraints.

varied, hypotheses were fixatedly proposed from the blocking
hypothesis space. Such fixedness is one of the representative
phenomena characterizing insight, and this leads impasses.
Fixedness is also generally found in daily life. Referred
to as functional fixedness, problem solving is inhibited by
the constraints of the daily usage of objects, even though we
are not compelled to do so (Duncker, 1945). Moreover, such
fixedness occurs not only in functional aspects but also in the
strategy selection of problem solving and memory retrieval
(Luchins & Luchins, 1950; Smith & Blankenship, 1991).
This phenomenon was also confirmed in the computer simulation results of this study. When solving the insight task,
if the blocking hypothesis existing in a different hypothesis space than the target space was given, the hybrid model
produced fixedness on searching for the blocking hypothesis
space. Moreover, the results clearly showed that the performance of the hybrid model was the lowest in solving the insight task because chunks formed by bottom-up learning lead
the model to search for blocking hypothesis spaces.
The simulation results suggest that fixation arises from the
accumulation of past experiences as chunks. However, in
many cases such a human though process facilitates problem solving– for example non-insight problems, where such
a nature effectively promotes the discovery of target rules.
In short, in non-insight problems, searching for hypotheses in the target space is facilitated by chunks formed from
past experiences. When the non-insight task was given to
each model in the simulations, the performance of the hybrid
model was the highest.
Actually previous research has pointed out two aspects of
chunks: while their existence for utilizing past experiences
effectively facilitates problem solving in non-insight problems, they also generate fixedness during insight problems.
Our research has provided explanations for the positive and
negative aspects of chunks using actual functioning computational models.

Conclusion
In this study, we discussed the insight process from falling
into an impasse to sudden discovery in both psychological
experiments and computer simulations. Proposed hypotheses by subjects in psychological experiments showed sudden
changes at the moment of discovering the target rule. By
contrast, searching for hypotheses captured by eye movement
analysis showed a gradual transition after negative feedback
was given. Even if in the final selection phase captured by
verbal reports, representation suddenly changes with flash of
luminance at the moment of finding the solution; in the process of achieving insight, blocking constraints are gradually
relaxed after receiving feedback from the environment. In
this study, it was confirmed that the bifacial characteristics
of the insight process arise from the interaction between the
adaptive process guided by a weak constraint and the knowledge driven process by a strong constraint.

Suddenness/Gradualness
In this study, psychological experiments verified that the bifacial characteristics of the insight process exist in the gradualness of the hypothesis search and in the suddenness of the
hypothesis proposal. Such bifacial characteristics of insight
appeared in the models’ behavior as follows.
In the hybrid model as an insight model, the search for hypotheses is performed by alternately switching between the
adaptive process and the knowledge driven process. When
an appropriate rule is found in the hypothesis search phase,
this rule is proposed as a hypothesis. If an appropriate rule
is not found in this phase, then a hypothesis is proposed by
the knowledge driven process based on past successful experiences. Hypothesis formation by the knowledge driven process is performed by using chunks as past successful experiences.
In other words, this hypothesis formation is constrained by
chunks. Such an insight process is characterized by both a
strong constraint and a weak constraint from the viewpoint
of mental constraint relaxation.
Strong Constraint: This constraint appears in hypothesis formation based on chunks of past experiences in the knowledge
driven process.
