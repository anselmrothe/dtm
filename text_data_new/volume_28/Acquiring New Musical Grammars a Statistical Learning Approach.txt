Abstract

A New Paradigm for Studying Musical
Acquisition

In the present study we examine the ability of humans to
acquire knowledge via passive exposure to a new musical
system. We designed two new musical grammars based on a
non-Western tuning system, and created melodies as legal
exemplars of each grammar. In two experiments each
participant was exposed to a set of melodies from one
grammar. Several tests were conducted to assess learning,
including forced-choice recognition and generalization, preand post-exposure probe tone ratings, and subjective
preference ratings. In Experiment 1, five melodies were
presented repeatedly. Participants correctly recognized and
preferred melodies they had heard, but failed to generalize
their recognition to new exemplars of the same grammar. In
Experiment 2, 15 melodies were presented repeatedly.
Participants showed some tendency to make generalizations
about new melodies in their given grammar, and also showed
an increased sensitivity to the statistics of the musical
grammar following exposure. Results suggest that larger sets
of exemplars promote the extraction of regularities underlying
the examples, whereas smaller sets lead to better recognition
and are more likely to influence subjective preference.

In the present study we examine this possibility by
investigating the learning of artificial musical grammars,
with the specific intention of probing for recognition,
expectation, and preference formation in the new musical
system. We designed two new musical grammars based on a
microtonal tuning system, very different from traditional
Western music. The musical grammars were constructed
such that they obeyed some psychoacoustic and Gestalt
principles, but were completely novel to all of our
participants. We presented adult participants with melodies
generated according to the grammars, and examined their
learning of the principles underlying those melodies. To
presage the results, we found extensive learning within a
relatively short time, supporting the notion that principles of
musical harmony can be implicitly acquired by humans via
passive exposure.

A New Musical System

Introduction
The ability of the human cognitive system to learn the
statistical properties of the environment has been posited as
a domain-general mechanism subserving human abilities
including language (Saffran et al, 1996), motor movements
(Hunt & Aslin, 2001), and music (Saffran et al, 1999). In
particular, evidence for knowledge in musical harmony has
repeatedly been demonstrated in humans through behavioral
and physiological methods (Besson & Faïta, 1995;
Krumhansl & Kessler, 1983). As many of these findings are
robust even in humans without explicit musical training
(e.g. Bharucha & Stoeckig, 1986; Koelsch et al, 2000), it
would seem that explicit training in music is not required for
the acquisition of knowledge in musical harmony, and that
this knowledge could be incidentally acquired by humans
via passive exposure to music.1

Extensive research has been done with common-practice
Western musical harmony, but much less research examines
the musics of other cultures (Eerola, 2003). From the
developmental standpoint, studies with infants (Trainor &
Trehub, 1994) have demonstrated some knowledge of
musical harmony at early ages. There has been little work,
however, systematically investigating the learning of a new
musical system. Thus, we take some time here to introduce
the musical system used in the present experiments.
In the traditional Western musical scale, frequencies of
notes are based around an octave, which is defined as a 2:1
ratio in frequency. Within the octave, the Western scale is
logarithmically divided into 12 even increments. Thus, the
frequencies of tones spanning an octave in the Western scale
are defined as the following:
Frequency (Hz) = k*2n/12

1
This does not deny the existence of underlying physiological
features that constrain possible musics. There may be both

physiological processes and powerful learning mechanisms that
simultaneously constrain possible musical systems.

where n is the number of steps along the chromatic scale,
and k is a constant and typically equals 440Hz.
For the following experiments we used the Bohlen-Pierce
scale (Walker, 2001), a microtonal tuning system based on
13 logarithmically even divisions of a tritave, which is a 3:1
ratio in frequency. The tones in one tritave of the BohlenPierce scale are defined as:
Frequency (Hz) = k*3n/13
where n is the number of steps along the tritave scale, and k
is a constant which equals 220Hz.
From the above formula we defined the following pitches
in one tritave of the Bohlen-Pierce scale (see Table 1):

Melody: 10 Æ 10 Æ 4 Æ 7 Æ 6 Æ 10

Based on this scale, it was possible to define chords using
pitches with frequencies that approximately related to each
other in low-number integer ratios, which are relatively
consonant psychoacoustically. One “major” chord in this
new system is defined as a set of three pitches with
frequencies that approximate a 3:5:7 ratio (see Krumhansl,
1987, for a derivation of chords in the Bohlen-Pierce scale).
We composed two sets of chord progressions, where each
chord progression consisted of four chords, and each chord
consisted of three pitches. Table 1 lists each of the pitches in
each chord, with the frequency of each pitch given by
substituting the pitch number into n in the tritave formula:
Frequency (Hz) = 220 * 3n/13.

These chord progressions formed the bases of the two sets
of grammatical rules which we used to form the stimuli of
the present study. By applying these rules in the fashion of a
finite-state grammar, we composed sets of melodies from

Figure 3. An illustration of applying a finite-state grammar
as a set of rules to compose one melody based on finite-state
Grammar I. Dark arrows illustrate the paths taken, whereas
light arrows illustrate the other possible paths that are legal
in the grammar. The resultant melody is shown at the
bottom of the figure.
Each melody was composed according to the two
grammars, with the following additional constraints:
1.
Each melody ranged from four to eight notes.
2.
Large intervals in one direction were followed by
small intervals in the other direction (see Narmour, 1990).
Using these two finite-state grammars as compositional
rules, a small subset of melodies can be legal exemplars of
both Grammar I and Grammar II, but these melodies were
not used in the present study. The musical grammars
described here can support important investigations not only
in music cognition, but also in statistical learning more
generally. Materials constituting our finite-state grammar
are such that the items themselves (the tones) are nonrehearsable in the sense that one cannot easily designate a
verbal label to each individual tone. Unlike existing
artificial grammar studies, such as those using artificial
speech syllables (e.g. Gomez & Schvaneveldt, 1994), these
artificial musical grammars force the cognitive system to
represent items in a nonlinguistic manner, thus minimizing
the possibility of rote memorizing the items of an artificial
grammar through covert verbalization of its exemplars.

2) Exposure: The second phase consisted of five
melodies generated from the assigned grammar being
played in randomized order for 25 minutes. Equal
numbers of participants were exposed to the two
grammars. Each tone lasted 500ms, and a 500ms
silence separated any two melodies. Each melody was
repeated 100 times over the course of exposure. While
listening to the melodies, participants were given the
option of drawing on provided paper as a distracter
task.
3) Forced-choice recognition and generalization: In the
third phase, participants were given a two-alternative
forced-choice task. The first part of the forced-choice
trials tested for participants’ recognition of melodies
they had heard during the exposure phase, whereas the
second assessed whether they could generalize their
recognition to novel melodies in the same grammar.
One block of five recognition trials preceded another
block of five generalization trials. In both types of
trials, two melodies were played one after another, with
an inter-onset interval of 5 seconds. Participants’ task
was to indicate which melody (the 1st or 2nd) sounded
more familiar. The alternative melody (the incorrect
answer) was always a melody drawn from the
alternative grammar. Thus, the right answer for one
group of participants was the wrong answer for the
other group.
4) Post-exposure probe tone ratings: In order to measure
the effect of exposure, (i.e. whether or not participants
had learned anything about melodic structure) we gave
them a second probe tone rating task after exposure.
This task was identical to the first probe tone task,
allowing direct comparison between the two sets of
data.
5) Preference ratings: To assess the degree to which
learning influences musical preference, the fifth and
final block consisted of preference ratings: participants
rated each melody in both grammars (20 melodies in
all) after it was played once. Ratings were on a scale of
1 to 7, with 1 being the least preferable and 7 being the
most preferable.

Having defined two sets of artificial musical grammars
based on a new musical system, we now have a tool to
answer many research questions. We present two
experiments in which melodies composed in the musical
grammars are presented repeatedly to participants, and preand post-exposure tests are conducted to assess the extent to
which participants acquired their grammar. In particular, we
ask the following questions regarding learning:
1. Can participants recognize grammatical items
(melodies) they had heard?
2. Can they generalize their knowledge of the
grammatical rules towards new instances of their
grammar?
3. Can they form expectations for the underlying
statistics of the new musical system?
4. Can they learn to form preferences for any aspects
of the musical grammars?
To address questions 1 and 2, we employ two-alternative
forced choice tests of recognition and generalization, where
participants hear familiar and unfamiliar melodies in both
grammars, and are asked to choose the more familiar
melody. Question 3 is addressed using probe-tone tests
before and after the exposure phase, where participants hear
a melody followed by a probe tone, and rate the degree to
which the probe tone fits the preceding melody. Finally, to
answer question 4 we conduct a subjective rating task where
participants rate their preference of each melody after
hearing it.

Method
Experiment 1
Subjects 24 undergraduate students from the University of
California at Berkeley participated in this study for course
credit. All participants had normal hearing and more than
five years of musical training. Each subject was randomly
assigned to one of the two grammars.
Stimuli All auditory stimuli were generated and presented
using Max/MSP (Zicarelli, 1998) and presented via
headphones at a level of 70dB. 20 individual melodies (10
in each grammar) were constructed and presented in pure
tones ranging from 220Hz to 660Hz, spanning one tritave in
the current musical system. Each tone lasted 500ms, with
envelope rise and fall times of 5ms each. The musical
grammars and melodies generated from them are described
in the previous section.

Experiment 2
Subjects 24 undergraduate students participated in this
study. Recruitment criteria were the same as Experiment 1.
None of the participants in Experiment 2 had been in
Experiment 1.
Stimuli In addition to the 10 melodies for each grammar
from Experiment 1, 10 new melodies were generated for
each of the two grammars. All other stimulus parameters
were the same as Experiment 1.

Procedure Experiments were run in a soundproof chamber.
Each experiment was run in five phases:
1) Pre-exposure probe tone ratings: A melody was
presented followed by a probe tone. The participant’s
task was to rate how well the probe tone fit the
preceding melody, on a scale of 1 to 7 (where 1 was
least fitting and 7 was best fitting).

1713

Procedure Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1 in
procedure, except for the following modifications:

1) Pre-exposure probe tone ratings: a different melody
(i.e. one not presented during the exposure) was used to
obtain probe tone profiles in both pre- and postexposure ratings.
2) Exposure: we increased the set of presented melodies
from five to 15. Each melody was presented 33 times
over 25 minutes of exposure.
3) Forced-choice recognition and generalization: 10
more trials were added to the recognition block, such
that this phase of the experiment contained 20 trials, 15
in the recognition block and 5 in the generalization
block.
4) Post-exposure probe tone ratings: this was identical
in materials and procedure to the Pre-exposure probe
tone ratings phase of Experiment 2.
5) Preference ratings: participants rated each of the 40
melodies (20 in each grammar) for their preference,
using the same scale and procedure as Experiment 1.

Participants’ judgments of individual probe tones were
correlated with the melodic structure present in their input,
and there was a trend towards an increased correlation after
the exposure.
Results from the preference ratings revealed mixed effects
of exposure on subjective preference. Participants exposed
to one of the grammars did not significantly prefer
experienced melodies to unfamiliar ones. The other
participants, however, rated the melodies they had heard as
significantly more preferable than melodies they had not
heard. Ratings for novel melodies from the familiar
grammar were not reliably different from ratings for
melodies in the unfamiliar grammar (see Fig. 5), suggesting
that a preference change was associated with familiarity but
did not extend to other instances of the grammar.

Results
Experiment 1
Figure 4 shows the data from the recognition and
generalization tasks, plotted as percent correct. A
participant’s response was scored as correct when they
selected either the melody that they had heard during
exposure (recognition items) or the novel melody generated
with the same grammar as their exposure melodies
(generalization items). When the participant selected the
melody generated by the other, non-trained grammar, their
answer was scored as incorrect.
As is evident in the figure, participants were significantly
above chance in identifying the melodies they had heard,
but were not above chance in being able to identify new
instances of the same grammar as more familiar.

is observed, suggesting that given 25 minutes of exposure to

Discussion & Conclusions
Experiment 1 showed that after participants were exposed
repeatedly to five melodies for 25 minutes, they recognized
and preferred melodies they had heard, but could not
generalize their knowledge to new melodies composed in
the same grammar.
In Experiment 2 we exposed participants to a larger
number of melodies (15 instead of five) for the same overall
length of time. Thus, participants heard each individual
melody fewer times than participants in Experiment 1. This
increase in exemplars and reduction in repetition affected
participants’ performance in the forced-choice tests:
participants now showed not only reliable recognition, but
also some evidence of generalization. Learning of the
musical system was also demonstrated in the probe tone
task, where the increase in correlation for post-exposure
ratings demonstrated that participants became more
sensitive to the underlying statistics of the grammar after
exposure.
Taken together, these experiments suggest that given
limited exposure to a novel musical system, humans can
exhibit rapid statistical learning to develop expectations that
conform to the musical grammar. Increasing the number of
exemplars of the musical grammar may a) help to enhance
sensitivity to the underlying statistics of a grammar; and b)
aid learners in generalizing the acquired statistics to new
instances of the same grammar. However, increasing the set
of exemplars also seems to be detrimental towards
preference ratings for familiar melodies. These results may
suggest that the subjective experience of musical preference
is not directly related to the increase of statistical sensitivity
or to the understanding of grammatical structure; instead,
preference may be a result of recognition and familiarity.
We plan to conduct follow-up studies to further examine the
link between familiarity and preference.
Having demonstrated that humans are able to learn new
musical grammars, it is now possible to tease apart
individual components of the input that constrain learning.
In our ongoing research we observe reliable generalization
using a much larger corpus of melodies at exposure. We
have also conducted similar studies on participants with no
formal musical training, with results showing that
nonmusicians behave very similarly as musicians in the
learning of the new musical grammars; thus we believe that
these effects are not a result of formal musical education.
Ongoing work also involves the use of Event-Related
Potentials to study human physiological activity during the
perception of this new musical system. Results from ERP
studies may shed light on the neural mechanisms that enable
statistical learning.
