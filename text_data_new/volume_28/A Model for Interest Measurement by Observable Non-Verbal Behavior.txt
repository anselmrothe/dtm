their non-verbal behavior tendencies can be divided into
quantitatively different groups. (2) It is more appropriate to
use specific methods for inferring individual interests for each
group in accordance with that group’s non-verbal behavior
characteristics than to use the same method for all groups. By
testing these hypotheses, we will construct effective methods
for inferring people’s interests.

Abstract
This paper proposes a model of non-verbal behavior in
information acquisition activity with a focus on the differences
between social and individual behavior. We derived a model
from the factor analysis results of information acquisition
activity for ubiquitous computing environments. Subjects were
clustered by tendencies of factor scores and then compared with
subjects' evaluation of the level of interest. The results reveal a
correlation between non-verbal behavior and interest that
depends on the statistical characteristics of the behavioral
model.

Analysis of information acquisition behavior
Experimental design
We conducted an experiment that focused on information
acquisition in a space that allowed free movement. We
recorded non-verbal behaviors by people involved in
information acquisition activities and examined the
statistically significant differences in these behavior
tendencies.

Introduction
In the field of ubiquitous computing research, development is
underway to create systems that can record various activities
in day-to-day life or work situations as well as automatically
recognizing and providing support for such activities. The
goal of this research is to develop systems that do not
interfere with natural human behaviors and that do not require
difficult mechanical operations (Weiser, 1991). We have
developed a system that infers the tendencies of people’s
interests in venues where people gather to acquire
information or engage in intellectual exchanges, such as
museums or academic conferences. Our system supports
people’s intellectual activities based on these tendencies. We
are developing small devices that record human behaviors
without input operations to infer these interest tendencies
through natural non-verbal behaviors (Ito et al., 2005).
Several studies have suggested methods to suppose interest
and intention from non-verbal behavior (e.g., Chiu, 2000;
Stiefelhagen, 2002). Our device’s unique feature is that,
despite its compact size, it offers a “situation recognition”
function achieved by incorporating standards for detecting
meaningful behavior-related information (e.g., the distance at
which an object is visible to the subject) into the physical
characteristics of sensors. In many cases, research in
ubiquitous computing relies on devices with similar simple
recognition functions (e.g., Nishimura et al., 2004). When
using these devices, however, it is difficult to discover new
indexes for inferring interests.
In this paper, we describe an experiment setting
constructed to enable highly accurate simultaneous recording
of physical actions, gazes, and utterances. Within this setting,
we conducted an experiment that quantitatively evaluated
non-verbal behaviors during information acquisition that
reflected the subject’s own interests. In this experiment, we
tested the following two hypotheses. (1) When people
acquire information in accordance with their own interests,

Task One subject was assigned the role of a person planning
a vacation and gathering information; another subject played
a guide who provided information to the above subject to
create a sightseeing plan that matched his own interests. To
minimize differences resulting from the subjects’ background
knowledge and ability to understand, we selected materials
related to sightseeing in locations far removed from where the
subjects live.

Figure 1: Example of sightseeing panels
Setting We constructed an experiment setting to represent a
sightseeing office with seven sightseeing information panels
(91 x 60 cm). The panels, arranged around the perimeter of
the experiment setting, provided the following information:
food and drink, arts and crafts, scenic spots, art galleries,
museums, historical sites, and a list of tourist information. All
panels had the same configuration. Two posters were affixed
to each panel, top and bottom, providing information on
sightseeing spots. Each poster was then divided into two

369

segments, right and left, providing general and detailed
information (Figure 1). For example, on the “Scenic Spots”
panel, the two posters provided information on “ZAO” and
“MATSUSHIMA.” The general information in the ZAO
poster included its location and highlights and a brief
introduction to the items in the detailed information segment.
The detailed information described two famous spots in ZAO:
“Crater Lake” and “Silver Forest.”

Construction of a Measurement Environment
Figure 2 is a photo of the experiment setting. The positions of
the panels and the positions and physical movements of the
subjects were measured using a Vicon Motion Capture
System. This system can record marker positions with a time
resolution of 60 Hz and a space resolution of about 1 mm.
The dimensions of the measurement space constructed for
this experiment were 350 cm (w) x 450 cm (d) x 250 cm (h).
Subject gaze direction was measured using Nac Image
Technology Inc.’s EMR-8B, a gaze measurement device that
resembles a hat. EMR-8B can record eyeball movements with
a time resolution of 30 Hz and an angle resolution of about
0.15º. Subjects wore the “hat-type” gaze measurement device,
a close proximity microphone, and a marker (Figure 3). To
enable subjects to move freely within the experiment space,
we used a flexible connecting cable 10 m long and 4 mm in
diameter. All measurement devices were synchronized using
the time code on the DVCAM video recorder. Synchronized
information recorded included “field of view video” from the
gaze measurement device, gaze point coordinates from the
gaze image surface, 3D coordinates for markers obtained
from a motion capture device, audio, and video.

Subject MC: Guide A professional information clerk
(female, 30 years old) played the “guide” role.
Subjects S1 ~ S22: Tourists Subjects S were 12 male and 10
female students around 20 years of age who lived near the
ATR laboratory.
Procedure Subject MC, who played the guide, provided
sightseeing information that reflected the requests of Subject
S, who played the tourist. A script was designed and
information was given according to it to ensure constant
quality in information. The following is an outline of the
script.
1. Lead Subject S to the front of the panel, show her/him a
list of sightseeing information, and ask her/him to select
interesting items in order of preference.
2. To create a relaxed atmosphere, encourage Subject S to
speak freely at any time.
3. In front of each guidance panel, first explain the
“outline” of each poster and then provide detailed
explanations in response to requests from Subject S.
4. Explain all posters, and end the presentation.
We adjusted the script so that explanations of all outlines only
requires about 10 minutes; explanations of all panels
including detailed explanations and questions requires about
20 minutes.
Subjects S, who played the role of tourists, were instructed
to gather information from the guide at the sightseeing office
and create a sightseeing plan tailored to their interests. They
were told that they could move about freely and talk during
the experiment. After the experiment was completed, they
filled out a descriptive questionnaire in which they entered
scores on a 5-point scale that asked how much they knew
about the content explained in the outlines and the detailed
descriptions of all posters and whether they were interested in
that content. They also answered Yes/No questions regarding
whether they asked questions or requested explanations from
the guide and whether the answers were sufficient.

Figure 3: Measurement system and motion viewer
Markers were affixed to each subject’s head (4 pts.),
shoulders (3 pts.), and arms (3 pts.) and to the four corners of
the panels. The four points on the head were used to
determine face position and direction and the position of the
gaze measurement device. The three points on the shoulders
were used to determine the body’s position and posture. The
three points on the arms were used to detect finger pointing
behavior.
The gaze point data are described in a field of view
coordinate system. Motion capture marker position data are
described in a global coordinate system. Using the position
data from the gaze measurement device, it is possible to
change the gaze point coordinates from the field of view
coordinate system to a global coordinate system and derive
gaze vectors in the global coordinate system. In this way, we
can record, with a high degree of accuracy, what the subjects
were seeing and when, as they freely moved about the
experiment space.

average time of 76.56 seconds (S.D.=37.51). We believe that
the guidance script functioned sufficiently, allowing us to
obtain stable results with little difference in conditions among
the guidance panels and between Subjects.

Indexing of observation results
The non-verbal behaviors were quantified with the
following indices based on observation results.
The number and the length of utterances (NU and LU)
The number and total duration of utterances were recorded for
each subject. Threshold values for microphone input power
levels were set for each subject to segment his/her utterances.
The number and the length of gaze (NG and LG) The
number and the total duration of gaze at the partner or a panel
were recorded for each subject. We categorized an eyemovement sequence as an occasion of “gaze at a panel/the
person” when it is within 5 degrees for more than 0.5 second.
The number of gaze movement (NGM) The number of eyemovements between each gaze was recorded while Subjects S
and MC were looking at the same poster.
The length of joint attention (LJ) We recorded the length of
time during which Subjects S and MC were looking at the
same poster.
The distance between the gaze points (DG) The distance
between the subjects’ gaze points on the panel surface was
measured while S and MC were looking at the same objects.
The number and the length of guided joint attentions
(NGJ and LGJ) The number and total duration of the
occurrences in which a gaze at a panel was overlapped or
followed within 0.5 seconds by the partner's gaze were
recorded.
The number of nods (NN) The number of nods was
recorded for each subject. We categorized a head movement
as a nod when the angle of the head changed more than 5
degrees in relation to the floor within 0.3 second.
The number of looking into the panel (NLP) The
occurrences of states when the distance between the head and
a panel was less than 1000 mm were counted for each subject.
The number of pointing (NP) The number of fingerpointings was recorded for each subject.
Relative distance and angle (Dist. and Ang.) Past research
has indicated that the positional relationship between persons
in a dialog is affected by the roles and social relationships of
the persons involved (e.g., Baker, R. 1968). We therefore
recorded the average values for relative distance (Dist.) and
angle (Ang.) to determine the positional relationship between
Subjects.

Under these conditions where the script operated smoothly,
we could estimate the degree of detailed guidance
information and Q&As based on the time for each poster
guidance. We assumed a high correlation between the length
of time and degree of interest; this correlation was confirmed
by the experiment results (Table 1). Our past research that
targeted exhibitions basically maintained this approach (Sumi,
2004). In general, however, it is often difficult to obtain stable
results regarding length of time due to a variety of factors,
including the guide’s degree of skill and the content involved.
For this reason, it was necessary to incorporate indexes that
could be used even when non-verbal behavior detection
results were normalized by length of time.
Detection results for non-verbal behavior Table 2 shows
the detection results for non-verbal behavior derived from
each pair in the experiment. In almost all indexes detected,
there are clearly broad individual differences in the behaviors
of student Subjects S compared to the guide MC.
Clustering of non-verbal behavior tendencies Non-verbal
behavior indexes for Subjects S1 through S22 were
normalized using guidance times for each poster (P1-P12).
Table 2 shows the correlation coefficients between these
results and the degree of interest. We identified an
intermediate level of correlation between the social behavior
of utterances and attention on the MC, but it was insignificant.

Experimental results
Three (one male and two female) of Subjects S were
dismissed as evaluation subjects for missing gaze data values
that resulted from an instability in gaze measurements,
stemming from eyelid and eyelash conditions. The average
time required by each pair for the experiments was 667.53
seconds (S.D.=158.67). The average time required for each
guidance poster was 47.42 seconds (S.D.=34.74). Broken
down into general and detailed explanations, 197 cases were
comprised only of general explanations, with an average time
of 37.50 seconds (S.D.=29.79), and 67 cases were comprised

Subject S conveying topics or intent to the MC. On the other
hand, the length of joint attention (when both MC and S were
looking at the same poster) was high in the negative direction,
indicating an absence of relaxed behaviors by the listener in
following the text or images in the posters in reflecting the
MC’s verbal guidance. A unique feature of Factor II is the
high factor load for number and length of utterances,
indicating social behaviors aimed at gathering information or
promoting smooth dialog through supporting responses,
questions, and other utterances. One unique feature of Factor
III is the high factor load volume for factors with weak
response-related social functions (i.e., responses less active
than utterances) directed at the MC; for example, the number
of eye contacts focusing on the MC or the number of nods.
There was also a high factor load for the number of gaze
shifts and a low factor load for joint attention, which suggests
a combination of social behaviors and independent behaviors,
such as looking at posters independent of the MC even while
continuing to make weak responses to the MC. A unique
feature of Factor IV is the high factor load for number and
length of gazes at the posters. This suggests a tendency
toward information acquisition activities with an emphasis on
individual behaviors.

For example, as seen from the scatter chart of utterance time
length and degree of interest (Figure 4), a longer utterance
time suggests a higher degree of interest, but we cannot say
the reverse; in other words, this correlation is not strong
enough to estimate degree of interest from non-verbal
behavior. We also cannot determine degree of interest from
individual behaviors such as focus of attention on posters.
We therefore conducted a factor analysis using Varimax
rotation principal component analysis to determine the
common factors in Subject S’s non-verbal behavior. We
extracted four factors with a primary eigenvalue of 1 or more.
The cumulative contribution rate for these four factors was
57.07%. Table 3 shows the list of factors following Varimax
rotation.

In this way, we extracted both social and individual
behaviors as factors from the measurement results of behavior
indexes for non-verbal behaviors. In Figure 5, we show our
proposed model for non-verbal behaviors in information
acquisition activities based on these results.

One unique feature of Factor I is the high factor load
volume for length of eye contact time when looking at the
MC and for the number of finger pointing actions. Another is
behaviors with social functions, such as conveying
understanding of the contents based on the MC’s guidance, or

Linkage (Between Groups) Rescaled Distance Cluster Combine

Figure 7 shows two examples of the plots of non-verbal
behavior during the experiment: Subject 14, from Cluster A,
and Subject 20, from Cluster D. The average degree of
Subject 14’s interest in all posters is 3.43 (on a 5-point scale)
and Subject 20’s average is 3.30, so there is no significant
difference between them. From this plot, we can see that
Subject 14 demonstrated extremely social and active
behaviors, for example, many utterances and frequent gazes
at the MC. Subject 20 demonstrated few utterances and vastly
fewer glances at the MC compared to Subject 14. Note,
however, that attention on the poster was very stable and
reflected the order of the MC’s guidance. We can thus
assume that other indexes are required to estimate the degree
of these two Subjects’ interest from their non-verbal behavior.

Table 4 Correlation between non-verbal behavior and
interest in brief guidance

We conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis to tentatively
categorize subjects based on non-verbal behaviors during
these information acquisition activities. Figure 6 shows a
dendrogram obtained by calculating average factor scores for
each subject and applying Pearson correlations and an
average linkage between groups. In this figure, we used four
clusters to clearly indicate the characteristics of Subject
groups and showed factor score distributions for Subject S’s
in each cluster. The main feature of Cluster A is the high
factor scores for social behaviors, particularly Factor II
related to utterance behaviors. The main features of Cluster B
are high scores for Factor III, social behaviors related to
response elements, and low scores for Factor IV, the number
of gazes at posters (an individual behavior). A notable feature
of Cluster C was the concentration of each factor score
around the 0 mark and a minimal amount of variation
between factors. In Cluster D, S08 showed an extremely high
score for Factor I, but if we consider this an exception, a
feature for the rest of this Cluster was a low score for Factor
III, which indicates response-related social behaviors such as
number of gazes and nodding. To summarize, Cluster A had
high factor scores for active social behaviors, cluster B had
high factor scores for responses and other pseudo-active
social behaviors, cluster C had low scores overall with very
little variation in factor scores, and Cluster D had low factor
scores for response-related behavior.

We recalculated the correlation coefficients of non-verbal
behavior and the degree of interest using clustering results
(Table 4). We confirmed that Cluster A, which had high
social factor scores, also demonstrated high correlation
coefficients between degree of interest and social behaviors
such as length of utterances and length of attention on the MC.
We believe that Subjects who emphasize such social
functions in the dialog process have a high tendency to
express their own interests to others. Similar results can also
be seen in Cluster C, which showed low variation in factor
scores, although the correlation coefficient was not high. In
Clusters B and D, we can see a correlation with attention on
the posters and gaze shift, which are individual behaviors. In
Cluster B, we observe low correlation with attention on the
poster, and simultaneously, a negative correlation with gaze
shift. Perhaps the Subject was focusing attention on an item
distinct from the poster being explained. As we saw in Table

373

social behaviors in the process of information acquisition
activities.
After establishing more subtle quantitative indexes for
these non-verbal behaviors in the future, we will create
indexes for social protocols with a focus on the temporal
continuity of mutual behaviors and conduct analyses based on
these indexes. We will also create settings for observing nonverbal behavior using more simplified detection devices and
incorporate these settings into practical and applicable
models.

1, the correlation between these individual behaviors and
interest tendencies could not be confirmed using existing
methods and appear as a result of a clustering effect.

Cluster A. Here, we can see that compared to Fig. 5 (before
clustering), Subjects with few utterances regardless of a high
degree of interest have been removed, which increases the
reliability of the estimates of interest.

Conclusion
In this paper, we constructed an experiment setting that
enabled accurate synchronization and recording of gaze,
physical behaviors, and utterances as non-verbal behaviors
during information acquisition activities. Using this setting,
we conducted an experiment to quantitatively evaluate nonverbal behaviors during information acquisition that reflected
the Subject’s own interests. We conducted a factor analysis of
quantitative results for non-verbal behaviors derived from the
experimental results and proposed a model of non-verbal
behaviors in information acquisition activities comprised of
four factors representing social and individual behaviors. We
then clustered S Subjects in accordance with this model,
based on tendencies in non-verbal behaviors. After
summarizing the correlations between degrees of interest and
non-verbal behaviors, we derived a higher correlation
coefficient than without clustering. We were also able to
observe a correlation between degree of interest and
individual behaviors such as gazing at posters, which could
not be obtained with other methods that do not use clustering.
In terms of non-verbal behaviors that express interest, it
became clear that there is a difference between groups that
show many individual behaviors and groups that show many
