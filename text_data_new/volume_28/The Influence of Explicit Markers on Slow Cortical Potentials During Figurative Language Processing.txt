directly if the preceding context is sufficiently constraining
(Gibbs, 1994). The constraint-based model holds that the
literal and figurative meanings of sentences compete for
activation and the most activated meaning is determined by
the relative strength of different sources of information for
those competing meanings (Katz & Ferretti, 2001).
A growing body of research has provided evidence that it
cannot be the case that people always construct a literal
interpretation before considering possible figurative
interpretations (e.g., Gibbs, Bogdanovich, Sykes, & Barr,
1997; Katz & Ferretti, 2001). Nonetheless, recent research
using event-related brain potential methodology (ERP) has
shown that people have more difficulty integrating words
into contexts when they are to be interpreted figuratively
rather than literally (Coulson & Van Petten, 2002; Katz,
Blasko, & Kazmerski, 2004), even when no differences are
found in self-paced reading times involving the same
materials (Ferretti, Schwint, & Katz, under review).

Abstract
Recent event related brain potential (ERP) results show
that figurative interpretations of proverbial phrases
(e.g., lightning never strikes the same place twice) elicit
sustained slow cortical potentials that are more negative
over the front of the head than for literal interpretations
of the same phrases (Ferretti, Schwint, & Katz, under
review). We extend this research by examining the
influence of explicit markers placed before the
proverbs, such as literally speaking and figuratively
speaking, and by contrasting two literal conditions in
which there either is overlap or no overlap between
content words in the proverbs and the preceding
contexts. The results show that slow cortical potentials
were most negative for proverbs interpreted in
figurative contexts, and most positive for literal
contexts that contained overlapping words. Moreover,
markers directed readers toward the contextually
appropriate interpretation of the proverbs earlier than
found in previous research. These findings have direct
relevance for theoretical explanations of figurative
language processing.

Slow-cortical potentials and figurative language
processing
Previous research using ERP methodology to examine
figurative language processing has primarily focused on
single word indices of text integration difficulty, such as the
N400 and Late Positivity. The N400 is the most widely used
ERP measure for investigating the semantic integration of
words in text (more difficult words produce larger N400s,
Kutas & Hillyard, 1980), and are often followed by a brain
potential that is more positive for words that are more
difficult to integrate (Coulson & Van Petten, 2002). These
measures have been useful for investigating manipulations
involving the final word of statements that are to be taken
literally or figuratively (Coulson & Van Petten, 2002; Katz
et al., 2004). However, using single word ERP indices to
investigate text integration difficulty for statements can be
problematic when discourse contexts have an influence that
begins early and is maintained across the figurative
statements. One can still use these indices to investigate
differences between conditions on the word in which the
differences between conditions first appear, but the

Introduction
In recent years, researchers have begun to examine how
people comprehend figurative statements when they are
placed in contexts that are consistent with either their
figurative or literal meanings. Different models of figurative
language processing make distinct predictions about how
and when figurative interpretations of text are constructed.
Some posit that figurative statements are constructed only
after an initial literal interpretation is determined to be
inconsistent with the preceding context (Grice 1975).
Alternatively, other approaches focus on different variables
that may increase or decrease the activation of figurative
meanings relative to literal meanings during language
processing, such as arguing that one is obligated to process
salient meaning regardless of literalness (Giora, 2003), or
positing that the figurative meaning of a phrase is accessed

To our knowledge there is only one study that has
investigated the role that markers play in the interpretation
of proverbs during online discourse comprehension. In this
research, Katz and Ferretti (2003) examined the effect of
Literally speaking, In a manner of speaking, and
Proverbially speaking on self-paced reading times for
familiar and unfamiliar proverbs placed in figurative or
literal biasing contexts. Although the markers helped
disambiguate the meaning of unfamiliar proverbs, and thus
decrease reading times, the influence of these markers on
familiar proverbs was small. With familiar proverbs, the
marker literally speaking had no influence on reading times
for the literal contextual condition, whereas the markers
proverbially speaking and in a manner of speaking
increased reading times up to the second last word of the
proverb. From the second-last word of proverb through to
the beginning of the subsequent sentence people read the
proverbs at a similar rate regardless of the contextual bias,
and regardless of type of marker employed.
In the research reported here, we extend the results of
Katz and Ferretti (2003) and Ferretti et al. (under review) in
a number of specific ways. First, we re-visit how people
interpret familiar proverbs preceded by explicit markers
using a larger item set that controls for problems with our
earlier item set. In particular, we use a larger set of familiar
proverbs (42 versus 12) that were all 7 words long (our
previous items varied in length). Second, we contrast a
literal context that ends with the marker literally speaking
with a figurative context that ends with the marker
figuratively speaking. The contrast between these two
markers is more direct between the meaning of literally and
figuratively. Furthermore, it enables us to extend our
investigation to another commonly used explicit marker.
Third, we use ERP methodology rather than self-paced
reading because recent research by Ferretti et al. (under
review) has cast some doubt on the sensitivity of self-paced
reading measures (at least as indexed by moving window
methodology) to differences between contextual constraints
on the ease of reading familiar proverbs. Finally, we
contrast two different literal contextual conditions in
addition to a figurative contextual condition. Specifically,
one literal condition has contexts that do not have any
content words that overlap with the proverbial statements,
whereas the second literal condition was identical with the
exception that it contained content words that overlap with
the proverbial statements. There are a couple of reasons for
contrasting these two literal conditions. One is that it
enables us to investigate how the overlapping content words
may lead to specific expectations for the upcoming
figurative statements. If this is true, then we may find
differences between the two literal conditions that occur on
the markers, before the proverbial statements are
encountered. Finally, adding the overlapping condition
provides a third level of possible integration difficulty due
to the amount of abstraction that must occur for people to
conceptually integrate the proverbial statements. Based on
previous findings by Ferretti et al. (under review) and

interpretation of differences on subsequent words in
statements becomes difficult because the ERP potentials to
these words are going to be influenced by earlier differences
between contextual conditions. We suggest that this issue is
important to consider in studies of figurative language
processing that involve investigations of how people
integrate entire figurative sentences, such as familiar
proverbs, into discourse contexts.
One way to deal with the problem of early context effects
discussed above is to conduct longer averages that begin at
the first word of a figurative statement and extend over the
entire statement. There are at least two advantages of
employing longer averages under such circumstances. First,
because the averages are time-locked to the first word of the
crucial statement they cannot be “contaminated” by effects
that occur earlier in the statement. Second, there is a
growing body of evidence in the sentence processing
literature that show longer averages capture slow potentials
that develop over sentences and, importantly, that these
potentials are sensitive to the ease in which sentences and
clauses are integrated into mental representations of the text
and, thus, have been taken as an index of working memory
constraints (e.g., King & Kutas, 1995; Münte, Schiltz, &
Kutas, 1998).
To our knowledge, only a recent study by Ferretti et al.
(under review) has investigated slow cortical potentials
while people interpret familiar figurative statements (i.e.,
proverbs such as lightning never strikes the same place
twice) placed in contexts biased toward either a literal or
figurative interpretation. The results from this study are
clear; at the third word of the proverbs, slow cortical
potentials at the front of the head were more negative for
proverbs preceded by figurative biasing contexts in
comparison to literal biasing contexts, and this difference
was sustained over the remaining words in the proverbs.
Interestingly, they found, as did Katz and Ferretti (2001)
with a different item set, no differences between the two
contextual conditions in a self-paced reading time study
employing the same items. The authors conclude that these
results demonstrate that people have more difficulty
integrating the proverbs in figurative than literal contexts,
and that self-paced reading may not always be sensitive to
processing differences between contextual conditions when
people read familiar figurative statements.

Explicit markers and proverb comprehension
In the present study, we investigate how explicit markers,
such as literally speaking and figuratively speaking,
influence how people interpret proverbial statements.
Explicit markers are brief statements presented immediately
prior to figurative language that invites the reader as to the
usage of the upcoming statement, in our case proverbs
(Honeck, 1997). Proverbs are often preceded by explicit
markers because their interpretation can be plausible in
either a figurative or literal sense. Thus, the markers help
disambiguate the intended meaning of the proverbial
phrases.

Coulson and Van Petten (2002), we expect to find a gradient
in how difficult it is to integrate the same statements into the
developing discourse – least for the literal contexts with
overlapping content words, and most for the figuratively
biasing contexts. These differences in integration difficulty
should be evident in the slow cortical potentials over the
front of the head.

(1a) Figurative context
“Why won’t you tell me what you’re making for my
birthday?” said Joseph as he peered into the kitchen. “It’s a
surprise and you’ll find out soon enough,” said Katherine as
she directed him away. As Katherine was pushing him from
the kitchen entrance, a recipe for Beef Wellington, Joseph’s
favorite food, dropped from the counter and he picked it up.
“I guess I’ll find out sooner than you thought,” said Joseph.
Katherine stated “figuratively speaking, the cat is out of the
bag.”

(1b) Literal Contexts (overlapping words in brackets)
“What could that possibly be?” wondered Joseph as he
gazed at a strange looking sack (bag) under the Christmas
tree that appeared to be moving. “You’ll find out
tomorrow,” said Katherine, as she moved to block his view
of the sack (bag). Suddenly, an animal (cat) scratched a
large tear through a small air hole and climbed away (out).
“I guess I’ll find out sooner than you thought,” said Joseph.
Katherine stated “literally speaking, the cat is out of the
bag.”

Thirty participants participated in the ERP experiment and
57 participants participated in the norming studies reported
below (27 for familiarity ratings, 30 for the remaining
norms). All participants were native English speaking
undergraduate students from Wilfrid Laurier University who
received course credit or financial compensation for their
participation.

Materials
Forty-two familiar proverbs were paired with either a
figurative context, a literal context without content words
that overlapped with the proverbs, or a literal context that
had content words that overlapped with the contexts (see
examples 1a and 1b). Each proverb was always preceded by
4 sentences that described conversations between people,
and the sentence preceding each passage was always
identical across the three experimental conditions. The
proverbial statements were preceded by the marker literally
speaking for the two literal conditions, whereas the marker
figuratively speaking always preceded the statements in the
figurative condition. In order to construct the literal
condition that did not contain overlapping content words
between the contexts and proverbs, we replaced the content
words with a synonym. On average, there were 2.5 content
words that overlapped with proverbial statements in this
literal condition.

The 42 proverbs and their corresponding passages were
placed across 3 experimental lists. Each list contained all
proverbs with 14 of the items from each of the three
experimental conditions. No participant saw any proverb or
context more than once, and across the 3 lists each proverb
was paired with each of the three experimental conditions.
Ninety-six filler trials that were similar in narrative form
and length were also included as part of each list and none
of these items contained figurative statements.

We conducted 4 separate norming studies in order to
insure that our items 1) were familiar (1 = not at all familiar,
7 = very familiar), 2) were equal in how comprehensible
they were in the literal and figurative contexts (1 = not at all
easy to comprehend, 7 = very easy to comprehend), 3) were
equal in how appropriate the proverbial statements were for
the literal and figurative contextual conditions (1 = not at all
appropriate, 7 = very appropriate), and 4) differed in how
figuratively or literally biasing the contexts were (1 = very
literal, 7 = very figurative). The results of these norming
studies are presented in Table 1. The only statistical
difference between the 3 conditions was for how
figuratively or literally biasing the contexts were (figurative
versus literal contexts with overlapping contexts, t(41) =
19.67, p < .001; figurative versus literal contexts without
overlapping contexts, t(41) = 19.13, p < .001).

Procedure
Participants sat in a chair in front of a computer monitor
located in a electrically shielded room. They read each
paragraph one word at a time and answered a periodic "yes"
or "no" comprehension question about the content of the
passages. All words were presented for a duration of 300 ms
with an SOA of 500 ms in the center of the computer screen.

EEG Recording and Analysis
The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 64
electrodes distributed evenly over the scalp. Eye movements
and blinks were monitored via additional electrodes placed
on the outer canthus and infraorbital ridge of each eye.

Electrode impedances were kept below 5KΩ. EEG was
processed through a Neuroscan Synamps2 amplifier set at a
bandpass of 0.05 – 100 Hz, and digitized at 250 Hz.

Results
Data was re-referenced off-line to the average of the left and
right mastoids. High frequency noise was removed by
applying a low-pass filter set at 30 Hz. ERPs were then
computed in epochs that extended 200 ms before the first
word of the markers to 500 ms after the onset of the last
word of the proverbs (i.e., -200 to 4500 ms). Trials
contaminated by blinks, eye-movements and/or excessive
muscle activity were rejected off-line before averaging; a
total of 22% of trials were lost due to such artifacts.

literal condition with overlapping words was more positive
than the other two conditions, which did not differ from one
another. There was a significant context by electrode
interaction. We investigated this interaction by conducting a
5-way ANOVA that again included context and list, but also
included hemisphere (left vs right), laterality (lateral vs
medial), and anteriority (prefrontal vs frontal vs parietal vs
occipital). In this analysis, context interacted with
anteriority, F(6,162) = 3.55, p < .05, and this interaction was
modulated by a three-way interaction with hemisphere,
F(6,162) = 4.25, p < .01. In these interactions, the literal
condition with overlap was more positive than the other two
conditions at anterior than posterior locations, and the threeway interaction demonstrated that these differences were
larger over the right than left hemispheres.

Three-way ANOVAs were conducted on the mean
amplitudes at 9 separate regions of interest: one for each
500 ms word region in the proverbs, and one for each of the
words comprising the markers. The primary factors of
interest were context (figurative vs. literal-synonym vs.
literal-overlap) and electrode site, both of which were
within-participants variables. List was used as a between
participant factor to stabilize variance caused by rotating
participants across different lists. All p-values are reported
after epsilon correction (Huynh-Felt) for repeated measures
with greater than one degree of freedom. Table 2 displays
the main effect of context and the context by electrode
interaction for each region of interest. Table 3 shows the
results of the simple main effects for context at these
regions. Figure 1 shows the topographical distribution for
mean amplitudes at all electrode sites, and Figure 2 shows
the mean amplitudes at two sites located on the midline of
the head.

At the second word of the markers there was a two-way
interaction between context and electrode site. The
distribution ANOVA at this region revealed a three-way
interaction between context, anteriority, and hemisphere,
F(6,162) = 3.20, p < .05. This interaction occurred because
the literal condition without overlapping content words was
more negative than the other conditions at anterior locations,
but was similar at posterior locations and, further, this
difference was largest over the left than right hemispheres.

Analysis for words in the proverbs. Visual inspection of
Figures 1 and 2 show a gradient in how negative the slow
potentials were across the seven words of the proverbs,
especially at anterior locations. Specifically, the amplitudes
for the figurative condition were the most negative,
followed by the literal condition without overlapping
contents words, and the literal condition with overlapping
words was the most positive. The main effect of context was
either significant or marginally significant for all words in
the proverbs. At every word location, the literal condition
with overlapping content words was significantly more
positive than the figurative condition, and also was
significantly more positive than the other literal condition at
the first word. The literal context without overlapping words
was significantly more positive than the figurative condition

Discussion
The results show that slow cortical potentials for proverbial
statements at the front of the head were most negative for
the figurative condition, followed by the literal condition
without overlapping words, and were most positive for the
literal condition with overlapping words. These results are
consistent with recent ERP results that show that people
have more difficulty integrating the figurative than literal

This model would need to explain why the familiar (and
hence salient) proverbs were not as easy, and maybe even
easier, to integrate into the figurative context than into the
literal contexts (especially when there were no overlapping
content words).
In conclusion, our results indicate the utility of
investigating slow-wave cortical potentials for the online
investigation of figurative language processing and for
investigating discourse processing in general. Furthermore,
they show that explicit markers can have an immediate
impact on how easily it is to integrate familiar proverbial
statements into a developing discourse representation.

meanings of words into contexts (e.g., Coulson & Van
Petten, 2002; Ferretti et al., under review). The present
results also show that the markers, in combination with the
literally and figuratively biasing contexts, influenced the
processing of the familiar proverbs earlier than found in
Ferretti et al. (under review). In that research, significant
differences in slow potentials for figurative and literal
conditions were not found until the third word of the
proverbs, whereas in the present research, the same two
contextual conditions (figurative and literal without
overlapping content words) differed at the second word.
The addition of the literal condition with overlapping
words show that people used these few words to quickly
generate expectancies for the proverbs. First, the slow
potentials for these markers was significantly different on
the first word of the markers (i.e., literally) relative to the
two other conditions. This finding is striking when one
considers that across the 3 contexts, the sentence preceding
the markers was identical, and that the other literal condition
only varied on average by 2.5 content words. Further, the
advantage of this condition over the other two conditions
was found at the first word of the proverb, and in
comparison to the figurative condition, remained throughout
the proverbs.
The marker literally speaking clearly had a different
influence on the literal condition without overlapping
content words; people had the most difficulty integrating the
markers by the second word of the marker (speaking) and
the first word of the proverb. One possible reason for this
effect is that readers were attempting to integrate the
information from the marker with the preceding contexts
prior to the proverbs, but because the content words did not
overlap directly it lead to integration difficulty.
Alternatively, it appears that for the figurative condition
people cannot easily generate a figurative interpretation
based on the markers until they receive the first few words
the familiar proverbs. We admit that this explanation for the
markers is speculative and that further research is needed to
clarify these differences. We are currently conducting
research that should clarify the nature of these early
differences. In this research, we are directly comparing
when the markers are present versus when they are absent.

Implications for Models of Figurative Language
Processing
Our results are most consistent with models that assume we
actively construct interpretations during discourse
processing, rather than retrieve entrenched meanings from
semantic memory (e.g., Coulson & Van Petten, 2002; Katz
& Ferretti, 2001). The fact that we find differences in slow
potentials on the markers and for the first few words of the
proverb cannot be accounted for by models of figurative
language processing which posit that the literal meaning of a
statement must be processed prior to constructing a
figurative meaning (e.g., Grice, 1975). The findings are also
problematic for the graded salience hypothesis (Giora,
2003) that assumes obligatory access of salient meaning.
