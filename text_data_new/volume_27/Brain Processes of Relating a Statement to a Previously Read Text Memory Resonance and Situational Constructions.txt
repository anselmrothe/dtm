Abstract
One of the most fundamental characteristics of texts consists
in the coherence among its sentences. We investigated by
fMRI where in the brain such coherence relations are
established and the relative duration of these processes by a
behavioral experiment. In four experimental conditions, the
coherence between a sentence and a subsequent test statement
ranged from an explicit and a paraphrastic to an implicit and
the lack of a precise relation (control condition). The
participants had to decide whether the test statement was true
with respect to the previously read sentence. For this decision
the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response
differentially indicated five brain regions (posterior cingulate,
STG, left and right IFG, frontal medial gyrus). These results
could consistently be interpreted to distinguish two interacting
but separate brain processes involved in coherence formation.
One of these processes may be termed memory resonance and
the other one situational constructions.

Introduction
A defining characteristic of a text is that its sentences are
not unrelated to one another but cohere. To understand a
text, a reader must therefore cognitively establish the
specific relations between a new statement and a previously
read text. The coherence between sentences may be
established in different ways: For example, by anaphora
resolution (Glenberg, Meyer, and Lindem, 1987), by
identifying overlaps in the arguments of different
propositions (Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978), by memory
processes which resonate for words with closely related
meanings (O’Brien, Rizzella, Albrecht & Halleran, 1998) or
by more effortful inference processes which are driven by a
search for meaning (Graesser, Singer & Trabasso, 1994).
O’Brien et al. (1998) postulate the resonance process in
memory to be both, autonomous and dumb and to be based
on the strengths of preexisting associations in semantic
memory. Thus, memory resonance is considered to be a
basic bottom-up activation process which may interact with
more goal-directed processes of forming a mental model for
the here and now description of a situation.
Memory resonance is assumed to be passive and in some
aspects similar to the bottom-up saliency-based processes of
attention (Itti & Koch, 2001). While bottom-up attention
processes assist an organism in analyzing a present scene,

memory resonance processes assist in a similar manner in
analyzing a reader’s past experiences (verbal and nonverbal) as they have become represented in memory. In
addition to this passive reactivation mechanism, there may
also be a task-dependent and more strategic process which is
driven by the reader’s goal of constructing a model of the
situation that is described by the text (cf. Graesser et al.
1994). Whereas the postulated memory process would
involuntarily reactivate memory contents, the taskdependent process would be more under the control of the
reader’s intentions (cf. Calvo et al., in press).
Experiments employing brain imaging techniques such as
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eventrelated potentials (ERP) can provide more detailed insights
on how text coherence is established (Ferst & von Cramon,
2001; Hagoort et al., 2004). In quite general terms, one
would expect that a passive memory resonance process
would occur earlier after the presentation of the critical
words and more likely in posterior areas of the brain. The
more effortful, task dependent processes of situation
constructions, on the other hand, should be more likely to
involve frontal areas of the brain, and possibly occur later in
relation to the onset of the critical words.
In agreement with this expectation, Ferstl & von Cramon
(2001) have already found that prefrontal midline areas and
the left posterior cingulate gyrus (BA 31) together with
neighboring inferior precuneal areas (BA 23) are involved
for establishing coherence by inferencing. Hagoort et al.
(2004) found that the left inferior prefrontal cortex is
involved in the integration of newly presented words with
both, meaning and world knowledge and that such processes
occur in the vicinity of 400 ms after the onset of the critical
word.
In the current study we investigated the brain processes of
relating a statement to a previously read text by more finegrained experimental contrasts. We employed experimental
materials that have been widely used in many behavioral
studies as well as for theoretical analyses (cf. Schmalhofer,
McDaniel and Keefe, 2002).
A small time window of 1.8 seconds was used, where a
statement consisting of two or three words had to be related
to the previously read sentences by determining whether or
not the statement would be true with respect to the described

1949

situation. To determine whether or not different components
would be more or less important in different occasions, we
experimentally manipulated the preceding sentences in four
different conditions.
In the explicit condition, the test statement is explicitly
stated by the preceding sentence. In the paraphrase
condition, the test statement has been introduced by
different words (paraphrased). In the inference condition,
the previous sentence invites the reader to draw a predictive
inference, possibly coinciding with the test statement that is
subsequently presented (cf. McDaniel, Schmalhofer &
Keefe, 2001). In the forth condition, the control condition,
there is not even such an inferencing invitation, so that the
test statement at first appears quite unrelated to the
preceding sentence. Nevertheless, even in this case, an
integration may be cognitively achieved.
A sample text material is shown in Table 1 together with
the test statement that was identical for all four experimental
conditions. For the specific purpose of our experiment, we
modified 120 such sets of materials so that all sentences
would be of equal length. These materials were constructed
on the basis of the materials which had been used in a
behavioral experiment (McDaniel, et al., 2001) as well as in
an ERP-experiment (Yang, Perfetti, & Schmalhofer,
submitted). In addition, we constructed filler materials (18
trials) which had different sentence structures. Furthermore,
we introduced a pseudo word reading condition (18 trials)
by scrambling the letters within a sentence so that the newly
constructed letter strings would be pronounceable.

We predicted that the time it takes to verify a statement
should increase from the explicit to the paraphrase and
inference conditions. The control condition should yield the
longest response times. We tested this prediction in a
behavioral experiment. It was in all respects identical to the
fMRI experiment, which we would perform thereafter
except that the participants sat in front of a computer
terminal instead of lying in an fMRI-scanner. For the fMRI
experiment, we expected posterior areas (e.g. cingulate
and/or parietal lobe) to be differentially involved in the
explicit and paraphrase conditions. In addition, for the
inference and control conditions, the middle frontal gyrus
and inferior prefrontal gyrus were expected to be

differentially involved. Activations in the temporal lobe
may furthermore indicate the interplay between memory and
situation construction processes.

Behavioral Experiment
Method
Forty students (19 women and 21 men) from the
University of Osnabrueck between 19 and 29 years of age
(average of 21 years) participated in this experiment for
course credit. The design and experimental procedure were
completely identical to the subsequently performed fMRIexperiment.

Results
Table 2 shows the proportion of correct responses in the
four experimental conditions and the mean latencies for the
correct responses. There was a significant difference in the
mean latencies among the five experimental conditions
(F(4,156) = 19.7, p < .001). Pairwise t-tests furthermore
showed that the latency of explicit, paraphrase, inference
and control condition were all significantly different from
each other (see Table 2).
As predicted the response latencies decreased with the
degree of the explicitness of the coherence between a test
statement and the preceding sentence.

fMRI-Experiment
Method
Participants. Thirteen right handed students with a mean
age of 22.8 years, all native speakers of German (7 women,
6 men) participated and received course credit.
Procedure. All subjects received written instructions as
well as a training session outside the scanner to become
familiar with the type of stimuli and the corresponding
tasks. Participants were instructed to press the YES key
when the test statement was true with regard to the situation
described by the just read sentence and the NO key
otherwise. For the pseudoword condition, they were told to
press the YES key when the pseudowords of the test
statement were identical to the last two presented letter
stings of the pseudoword reading phase and the NO key
otherwise.
After a training session in the scanner, participants were
presented with the three functional scanning sessions. Each
session took 16 min 12 sec. The participants were allowed
to rest up to three minutes between sessions.
For each trial, the words of a sentence were displayed by
a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) technique. Table 3
shows the timing of a trial including the test statement and
fixation phases in between sentences. The start of each
stimulus block was jittered by 0, 1 or 2 seconds. The
experiment ended with the acquisition of a structural image,
which lasted 5 minutes.

Image Acquisition: All MR-images were acquired in a 1.5
T Siemens Sonata whole body MRT equipped with an 8channel head coil (MRI-devices). The head of the
participant was fixated by pads. Earplugs and earphones
were used for noise shielding and to instruct participants
between functional image acquisition. During the functional
scans, the BOLD response was measured using a gradient
echo EPI sequence (TR = 3 s; TE = 50 ms; flip angle = 90°;
resolution 3x3x3 mm3, number of slices = 35, acquisition
sequence “interleaved”, slice thickness = 3mm, distance
factor: 0-10 %). The acquired slices were rotated
approximately 10° relating to the AC-PC line in order to
cover prefrontal, parietal and temporal regions in full and
the majority of the occipital cortex, sometimes excluding
V1. In each of the three functional sessions 326 images were
recorded. Structural images were acquired for each subject
using a T1 weighted MPRage sequence (TR = 1900 ms; TE
= 3.93 ms; resolution 1x1x1 mm3) at the end of the
experiment.
Data Preprocessing and Analysis: All MR-data were
preprocessed and statistically analyzed using SPM2
(Functional Imaging Laboratory, Welcome Department of
Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK). Functional images
were corrected for acquisition timing, realigned to the first

image and coregisterd to the structural images. Movement
corrections were below 6 mm for all but one participant who
showed a translation across the three functional scanning
session of close to 8 mm. After normalizing all images to
the MNI template, functional images were resampled to
2x2x2 mm3 and spatially smoothed using an isotropic
Gaussian kernel with 10 mm FWHM.
A general linear model was applied to the individual data.
For each condition, the processing of the title, the sentence
and the test task were modeled. The modeling of sentence
presentation was split into 3 blocks of equal length covering
the entire sentence presentation to account for differences in
sentence encoding before the verification.
The verification process was modeled by a block,
beginning with the onset of the presentation of the test task.
The length of the block was selected to coincide with the
average response time in the inference condition of the
slowest participant (1.8 seconds). t-test contrasts were
calculated between test tasks in the inference, explicit,
paraphrase, and control conditions. For statistical analyses, a
Random Effects Model was used bringing the appropriate
individual contrast measures into a simple t-test on 2nd level.
Statistical maps were thresholded with t = 3.93 (uncorrected
p = .001) and clusters surpassing a corrected p value of .05
on cluster level (approx. 110 voxels) are reported as
significantly activated.

Results
Behavioral results. The response latencies to the test
statements showed again an increase from the explicit to the
paraphrase and the inference conditions. The mean latency
was longest in the control condition. While the difference
between explicit and paraphrase was not significant, all
other differences were (see Table 2). This pattern of results
is in good agreement with the behavioral experiment. The
most noticeable difference is that the latencies are overall
somewhat longer than in the behavioral experiment.

FMRI results. An overview of the significant differences
in the statement verification task is presented in Table 4.
The rows and columns of this table are arranged so that
differences predicted by a levels theory (cf. Schmalhofer et
al., 2002) would show up in the lower left triangle. As seen
from Table 4, 5 of the 6 predicted and 12 possible
differences yielded significant differences.
Thus, the
experimental conditions which according to a levels theory
require more processing indeed showed more brain
activities. By identifying the brain areas which caused these
additional brain activities, we may furthermore examine
whether the particular brain area and the specific function
proposed by the theory fit together. The specific clusters
which were identified by these comparisons are shown in
Figure 1 and described in more detail in Table 5.

The comparison Paraphrase > Explicit showed one
significant cluster in the right posterior cingulate gyrus. The
posterior cingulate gyrus has been consistently found in
successful episodic memory retrieval (Cabeza & Nyberg,
2000; Wheeler & Bucker, 2004). Fletcher et al. (1995)
attributed posterior cingulate regions to be involved in
visual imagery and possibly the incorporation of
information into an evolving discourse structure. Posterior
cingulate and neighboring cuneal and precuneal regions are
also activated when picture stories are processed

(Gernsbacher & Kaschak, 2003). These areas may thus
reflect mental imagery processes in story comprehension
(Maquire et al., 1999).
The comparison Inference > Paraphrase showed a large
cluster in the medial portion of the left and right superior
and middle frontal gyri. Such middle frontal activations
have been attributed to theory of mind inferences and more
generally, inferences that are needed to establish a coherent
conceptual representation as it is established in situation
models (Ferstl & von Cramon, 2001, 2002; Fletcher et al.
1995; Mazoyer, Tzourio, Frak, & Syrota, 1993).
Frontomedian activations have also been implicated for the
generation of plans and internally guided force in general
(Vaillancourt, Thulborn & Corcos, 2003). These areas
exceed the functions that are unique to memory and
language processes and may in particular be relevant for
constructing a particular situation to act in it.
The comparison Inference > Explicit showed in addition
to the significant results of the two previous contrasts, a
third large area in the inferior frontal gyrus overlapping with
Broca’s areas 45 and 47.
The comparison Control > Explicit showed once more the
middle frontal gyri and the left inferior frontal gyrus to a
somewhat larger extent and with higher activations than the
Inference > Explicit comparison. In addition to these areas a
region at the junction of the left temporal and parietal lobes,
covering parts of the middle and superior temporal gyri and
the supramarginal gyrus was significant. Furthermore
clusters in the posterior cingulate gyri bilaterally, in the
right middle frontal and precentral gyri, as well as an area
in the right inferior frontal gyrus were found.
The comparision Control > Paraphrase yielded similar
results as the comparison of Control > Explicit. The regions
most prominently activated were in the fronto-median wall
and the right inferior frontal gyrus. A posterior midline
activation was found in the precuneus. Further clusters in

the left inferior frontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the
left temporo-parietal junction, the right middle frontal and
precentral gyri as well as an area in the inferior and middle
temporal gyri also showed significant activation.

Discussion
The current results can also be interpreted consistently
and comprehensively. For language and memory tasks (cf.
Ullman, 2004), posterior and prefrontal regions form an
interdependent network. The posterior cingulate’s
connections to prefrontal regions (Morris, Petrides &
Pandya, 1999) show its link to a more integrative, structurebuilding region of the brain. Memory retrieval may depend
on an interaction between posterior cingulate, posterior
parietal association areas, prefrontal areas and mid temporal
lobe structures. The medial temporal lobe retrieves
information from memory and parietal regions maintain
representations of remembered information. The prefrontal
cortex exerts an important role concerning activated
memory representations in the parietal lobe as well as

offline memories in temporoparietal regions. It sets up
retrieval mode, initiates the retrieval attempt in temporal
regions and monitors and selects upon activated memory
representations. The extensive connections between those
regions would indeed allow for a coordinated interplay. The
interdependency between passive and strategic components
in inferencing has recently also been demonstrated in a
behavioral experiment by Calvo et al. (in press).
The fMRI experiment showed which brain areas become
differentially involved in relating one and the same
statement to variations of a previously read text. The
posterior cingulate gyrus, supposedly signifying routine
memory processes, was found to be active when an
integration is achieved via a paraphrase. The medial frontal
gyrus, supposedly indicating more effortful and strategic
construction processes, becomes involved when an
additional coherence link needs to be established.
The constructive processes of the control condition
require more extensive memory retrievals involving the
posterior cingulate gyrus and the left STG. In addition,
coarse semantic relations may become activated in the right

hemisphere (e.g. the right IFG; cf. Mason & Just, 2004).
The activated situational knowledge may then become
integrated in the left IFG (cf. Hagoort et al. 2004). This
hypothesis is empirically supported by the Control >
Explicit and Control > Paraphrase contrasts which show
these specific brain areas. In the explicit and paraphrase
conditions such construction processes are not required
because of the autonomous memory resonance process
which achieves the linkage in a more economic way.
Overall, the current results provide a means for
differentiating the role of a more passive memory process
(O’Brien et al., 1998) and a more active construction
process (Graesser et al., 1994) in relating a statement to a
previously read text. The passive memory process may be
termed memory resonance because it establishes a relation
on the basis of local information. A related ERP-experiment
has furthermore shown when these processes occur by
N200, P300 and N400 components (Yang et al., submitted).
The current study characterizes these two types of
coherence formation processes according to where they
occur in the brain by fMRI data.
