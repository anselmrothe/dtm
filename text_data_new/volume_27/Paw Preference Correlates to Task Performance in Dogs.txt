Abstract
A study involving 36 domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in a
simple search task provides evidence of a correlation between
paw use and performance. The study was carried out to
determine whether or not paw use is related to task
performance. Different aspects of task performance were
taken into consideration. The results of an experiment indicate
that dogs departing with the left front paw perform
significantly better than dogs departing with the right front
paw. Moreover, gender differentiation was not replicated by
our data, thus opening new avenues of research with other or
other additional factors to gain insight in the gender
differentiation found earlier.

Introduction
Since the discovery of hemispheric lateralised behaviour in
non-human species (see, e.g., Rogers, 2002; Vallortigara
and Bisazza, 2002), the research has shifted to discover the
nature of that lateralised behaviour. With respect to the
nature of lateralised behaviour in the domestic dog (Canis
familiaris) the only research results published to date are
(Tan, 1987; Wells, 2003; and Quaranta et al., 2004). Their
research results have opened new avenues for research into
paw preference in dogs.
Tan (1987), the first to publish on this topic reported on
paw preference in an experiment in which dogs were to
remove an adhesive plaster from their eyes. Tan reports that
57.1% was right-preferent, 17.9% left-preferent, and 25.0%
ambidextrous. He does not report on differences between the
sexes.

Quaranta et al. (2004) repeated the experiment with
adhesive paper (now to be removed from the snout). They
observed population lateralisation (like in humans) but
exactly in the opposite directions in the two sexes. Their
study suggests that male dogs have a preference for their left
front paw, while females for their right front paw. They
report that approximately 70% of the male dogs and 80% of
the female dogs showed individual preference for using
either of the front paws. In more detail, they found
significant left front paw preference in male dogs, and only
a slight preference for using the right front paw in female
dogs, although this last result might be due to the small
number of samples (29 female dogs).
The research of Wells (2003) also suggests clear left paw
preference in male dogs and clear right paw preference in
females. To check for task-dependency, Wells experimented
with three different tasks: lifting paw on command,
removing a blanket placed over the head of the dog
(centrally, also blindfolding it), and removing a bowl that
was placed over food the dog could see and sniff. Analysing
the results of the three tasks, Wells concluded that there
were significantly more dogs paw-preferent than ambilateral
and that there was no significant difference between the
number of left-pawed versus right-pawed dogs. She also
concluded that paw preference was significantly influenced
by the sex of the dog (female-right, male-left). This
difference in paw use with respect to sex can be seen most
sharply in task 1, less in task 2 and the least in the third task.
When discussing results and methods Wells also argues that
the performance of dogs in task 1 may be an already

reinforced and learned behaviour (the way owners were
teaching the command for paw-giving to dogs). This leaves
an open place for debate on reinforced paw preference and
true handedness. Finally, she reports significant positive
inter-task correlations: 26 out of 53 dogs (16 males and 10
females) changed paw preference between the first two
tasks.
Both the results of Quaranta et al. (2004) and Wells
(2003) show left paw preference in male dogs and right paw
preference in females. However, the possibility of task
dependence reported by Wells makes it clear that
understanding paw preference in dogs requires more
research. What is it in the task or the setting that makes the
paw preference change? A key to answering this question
might be found in the task dependence of motivation, see,
for example, Atkinson’s achievement motivation (Atkinson
and Feather, 1966), the attributional theory of Weiner
(1991), and for an overview (Hyland, 1988).
The notion of achievement motivation might be the
explaining theory for the hypothesis studied in this paper:
“Paw preference correlates to task performance”. This
hypothesis is the result of observing dog behaviour in
therapeutic work by the authors, where it seems that
departure with the left front paw is indicative of a good
performance of the task assigned to the dog by the handler,
whereas departure with the right front paw is indicative of a
bad performance. All tasks considered here involve the dog
moving forward, e.g., follow the handler, go forward, fetch
an object, come to the handler, and search an object.
Literature research revealed no reports on anything remotely
similar to this hypothesis.
The results of a first test of the “Paw preference
correlates to task performance” hypothesis, as reported in
this paper, support the hypothesis. The rest of this paper is
organised as follows. The Task Description section
describes the task chosen, the appropriateness of the task,
and an analysis of paw use and aspects of performance
relative to the task. The Method section describes the
acquisition of subjects and data, the selection of data to be
analysed, and the analytical procedure used. The Results
section, presents the statistical analysis of the experiment, in
terms of aspects of performance, paw use, sex
differentiation, and trainings level. The Discussion relates
the results of the experiments with other work and identifies
future directions of research.

Task Description
The task to test the hypothesis “Paw preference correlates to
task performance” has to meet the following requirements.
• Executable by dogs of all ages after leaving the breeder
(approximately 8 to 10 weeks old), of all breeds, of all
sexes (including neutered), and of all trainings levels.
• Involves a forward movement of the dog to perform the
task.
• Allows video registration from different angles.
• Shows natural performance, not trained, or conditioned
performance.

• The notion performance should be definable in terms of
objective observables.
The Search Task section motivates the choice of the
experiment and provides a description of the experiment. It
also describes the results of a pre-test to validate the
appropriateness of the experiment. The Aspects of
Performance section describes the aspects of performance
that were used to analyse the results of the experiment.

Search Task
Based on the above requirements, the choice was made for a
search test involving the sense of smell. Smell was chosen,
because of the three senses that can be used to entice
forward movement (smell, hearing, sight), smell is the first
active sense, see, e.g., (Scott and Fuller, 1998; Dehasse,
1994). Therefore, even a puppy should have enough
experience in using that sense. To create a small setting that
allows video registration, the testing arena is only 5 by 10
meters, see Figure 1.

Figure 1: Setup of the experiment
The camera at the bottom (2 meter from the dog) zooms in
on the dog paws. The one at the top (10 meter from the
baseline) has an easy overview of the whole area. At the
beginning of each trial it also zooms in on the paws, to film
departure. A goody is hidden underneath one of three cones
positioned at 5 meters from the baseline. A blindfold is used
to keep the dog from seeing where the goody is placed. The
wind comes from the top, so that the smell of the goody
travels towards the baseline. The dog departs from the
position with the flag as sent by its handler.
To avoid the possibility that the dogs showed trained
behaviour, a setting was chosen that was unfamiliar to the
dogs. To avoid conditioning or training during the
experiment no more than 3 trials per dog took place. To
allow for variation in paw preference per dog, exactly 3
trials were chosen. As a consequence the test is a population
experiment. More details of the way the experiment was
conducted are given in section Method.
The appropriateness of the experimental setting was
tested using 4 dogs (1 male adult, 1 male pup of 3 months, 1
female adult, 1 female pup of 3 months). All pre-test dogs
had no or only a low trainings level (puppy course). All

2249

dogs responded actively on the smell of the goody (nose
licking, nose twitching and trying to move the head
forward). After release, one pup went straight for the correct
cone, the other pup showed only minor interest in the goody,
even when guided towards it. The two adults found the
goody themselves: one in a rather straight line, the other
after first exploring the arena.

Aspects of Performance
In order to test the validity of the hypothesis, the notion
performance needs to be defined in objective and observable
terms. Aspects considered with respect to this experiment
are: duration, sniffing at the correct cone, sniffing at a
wrong cone, standing still at a distance from the correct
cone, moving away from the correct cone, passing the
correct cone (a specific form of moving away from the
correct cone), going to the experimenter, going to the
handler, urinating, biting a cone. These concepts were
obtained in a number of brainstorming settings with our
domain experts in dog therapy, and on the basis of our
literature study. The concepts were formally defined before
the start of the experiments.
All of the concepts introduced above turned out to be
useful, except duration. Since the experiment concerns a
population test, not on individuals, the speed with which
dogs perform the test differs too much and is unrelated to
performance. There are dogs that go straight for the cone in
a slow speed, and those that do so in high speed. Similarly,
other dogs are all over the place; some in high speed, some
slowly. The only aspect of speed that could be useful, is the
relative speed of a dog with respect to another trial by the
same dog. However, since the number of trials used in this
experiment cannot be more than 3 (to avoid training), in the
current setting it is not trivial to consider duration as an
aspect of performance. Therefore, designing an experiment
where duration can be used as performance measure is left
for future work.
The remaining concepts were derived from the following
principles of scenting in dogs, see, for example, (Müller,
1984; Pearsall and Verbruggen, 1982). The performance in a
search task using scent can vary from perfect to abominable,
and numerous variations in between. A perfect performance
would be that the dog goes in near straight line from the
point of departure to the correct cone. An abominable
performance would be, e.g., that the dog never moves away
from the departure point, or that the dog repeatedly runs in
all directions all over the arena, without stopping to sniff at
the correct cone. When considering the arena a number of
objects carry scent related to the goody presented by the
experimenter to the dog’s nose: the experimenter, the goody
cone, the wrong cones (because the goody has been under
one of these in the past), and the places were the
experimenter walked. When evaluating all these objects in
terms of strength of smell, then two objects stand out: the
correct cone and the experimenter. The fact that the
experimenter carries an attractive small is considered for
two reasons. First, the possibility cannot be excluded that

(s)he carries the smell of the goody. Second, the dogs might
associate the smell of the experimenter with the fact that this
is the person who offers the goodies. Furthermore, the scent
of the goody and that of the experimenter evaporates: the
closer to the object, the stronger the smell. Therefore, going
towards to the object with scent is better than moving away
from the object. Combining this with the previous
identification of the goody cone and the experimenter as
having the strongest scent leads to the following
conclusions. The dog can choose to try to find the
experimenter, or the goody, or do neither. When comparing
moving away from the chosen object or moving towards
that object, then the first is a bad move, the second a good
move. Similarly, sniffing the correct cone is better than
sniffing a wrong cone. Furthermore, any other action that
does not contribute to getting the goody or finding the
experimenter, contributes to a less than ideal performance.
Accepting that some of the aspects mentioned above
contribute to a less than ideal performance, does not imply
to what extent each of them contributes. Therefore, all
aspects should be noted when looking at the results of the
experiments, and when analysing the data.
To analyse paw preference, a definition of paw use in
departure had to be formulated before the experiment could
be analysed. This led to the following criteria for accepting a
trial for analysis. The dog has to stand or sit still for at least
two consecutive images on the video, meaning that his paws
do not move in those two images.
Furthermore, the definition of paw use has to be related
to the gait in which the dog departs. If the dog departs in a
walk or a trot, the first front paw to move forward is taken
as the paw used. If the dog departs in a gallop in which both
front paws are lifted simultaneously, the front paw that
reaches most forward is taken as the paw used. The
distinction between the different types of gait corresponds to
the definitions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica2.

Method
This section explains our acquisition of subjects and the
procedure followed during the experiments.

Subjects
To be sure of a large enough pool of data, a number of dog
schools and dog-walking centres were approached to ask for
volunteers. In this manner, 98 dogs participated in the
experiments. Due to mistakes with the equipment (not
recording, mislaying a tape), of those 98 dogs, 25 dogs
could not be used for full analysis. Furthermore, of the
remaining dogs, those dogs were dismissed from analysis,
that did not stand or sit still before departing, or whose
handlers pulled the leash at moments that influenced the
results. This affected especially the young dogs. All in all,
the results of some 55 dogs passed those criteria.
Before starting the analysis, a subset (of 36 dogs) of
those 55 was chosen with the aim of having a fair

distribution with respect to trainings level, age, and gender.
A low level of training means none at all, puppy- or basic
levels, and a high level means GG1 or higher in Dutch
training terms. Conform (Dehasse, 1994; Scott and Fuller,
1998) age was taken as adult (2 years or older for males, 1.5
years or older for females) versus non-adult. The gender
issue was inspired by the studies reported in (Wells, 2003)
and (Quaranta et al., 2004). Thus, there were 18 males and
18 females, each group consisting of 9 dogs with low and 9
dogs with high trainings level. Non-adult dogs with a high
training level are hard to come by. Therefore, 8 of the 36
dogs were non-adult: 4 of them females with low trainings
level, 2 males with low trainings level, 2 males with high
trainings level. Table 1 summarises the demographic data of
the selected dogs.

ground and on the experimenter. Although the arena is never
neutral after the first trial, every effort is made to keep the
arena as neutral of scents as possible. Furthermore, other
dogs are kept far from the arena, also ensuring that a dog
cannot learn from watching predecessors. Each dog goes
through three trials: the goody is hidden first underneath the
middle cone, then underneath the left cone, then underneath
the right one. After the instructor has hidden the goody he
goes back to the handler and the dog. On a sign from the
instructor the handler removes the blindfold and (if possible)
lets the dog sit to his left. The handler then lets go of the dog
and commands the dog to search. The experimenter is
allowed to encourage the dog to go forward, and can even
walk a few steps forward himself. However, until the dog
clearly found the correct cone, the handler is not allowed to
come within 2 meter of the line of cones. The handler and
experimenter stay below wind of the correct cone.
After a trial is ended, e.g., because the dog found the
goody, or the experimenter decided to stop, the handler
takes the dog back to the flag for the next trial.

Analytical Approach
For each dog selected the video images from both cameras
were annotated using a formal language based on the aspects
of performance as described in Section Task Description.
The formal annotation was created on the basis of at least 2
people viewing the images. If the first 2 people disagreed, 2
more people viewed the images, after which all people
involved discussed the images. Disagreements mostly
concerned the paw of departure and in two cases the overall
performance. Disagreements over paw departure were
almost always solved by agreeing on the speed the dog
departed in (trot and gallop can be misleading). In one case,
a double image of the left paw was mistaken by one person
as the right paw being more forward.
The aspects of performance were each formalised in
logic and an automated checker was used to check each
aspect against each trial of each dog. The results of the
automated checker were statistically analysed.

Results

Procedure
Before entering the arena, the handler is told to walk his dog
around the arena to allow exploration of the arena.
A trial begins with the handler and his dog at the flag.
The handler holds the dog between his legs and blindfolds
the dog either with a paper towel or in case of strong
resistance of the dog, by holding a wooden board. They both
face the experimental area. The instructor goes towards
them and holds a goody (a piece of sausage) on a saucer
under the nose of the dog. The goody is then hidden
underneath one of the cones. Goodies are put on a plastic
saucer that avoids sausage smears at its position on the

Each of the essential aspects contributing to a less than ideal
performance was checked against each of the trials of each
dog in the selection. A summary can be made of all aspects
that contribute to bad performance by recognising that all
these aspects have in common that the dog does not move
toward the goody. This consideration motivates the
statistical analysis of what together might be termed “bad
behaviour”, without denying the gliding scale of
performance.
The most important results of the experiment are
provided in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 contains the χ2-analysis
of the paw-performance variables. The first column
indicates the variables considered, the second column
indicates the trial number, and the next four columns give
the number of observations of the different combinations.
The last two columns show the χ2-value and the significance

2251

of the χ2-tests. For example, the first row indicates that of
the 36 dogs considered in trial 1, 14 dogs started with left
and performed good, 2 dogs started with left and performed
bad, 3 dogs started with right and performed good, and 17
dogs started with right and performed bad. As the last two
columns indicate, in this trial the correlation between paw
and performance was significant (χ2=18.75, p<0.001). In
Table 2, performance is defined as described in the Section
about ‘Aspects of Performance’. Moreover, away stands for
moving away from the correct cone, and sniffing stands for
sniffing at a wrong cone.
As shown in the last three rows of Table 2, over all trials
there is a significant correlation between paw and
performance (χ2=37.69, p<0.001), but also between paw and
the more specific aspects of performance, moving away
(χ2=8.69, p<0.003) and sniffing (χ2=16.00, p<0.001). These
correlations are also present when considering trial 1 only,
but some of them disappear in trial 2, and all of them
disappear in trial 3. However, when only considering the
dogs that depart with a specific paw, more interesting results
are observable. For example, of the 18 dogs departing with
left in trial 2, only two dogs move away. This amount is
significantly small (binomial test, p<0.001). Likewise, of the
18 dogs departing with right in trial 3, 15 dogs perform
badly, which is again significant (binomial test, p<0.008).
Given these findings, one could wonder whether the
dogs were paw-persistent over the trials. This turned out not
to be the case. Over the 3 trials, 55.6% (20 of 36) of the
dogs switched their departing paw. A considerable subset of
those dogs (50%, 10 of 20) also switched their performance
accordingly (not depicted in the Table).

Globally over all trials, among the dogs departing with
right, the percentage that performs badly remains more or
less stable (85.0%, 94.1%, 83.3% in subsequent trials),
while among the dogs departing with left it increases
(12.5%, 16.7%, 55.6% in subsequent trials). The number of
dogs departing with left (52 of 107, 48.6%) and with right
(55 of 107, 51.4%) remained approximately constant over
the 3 trials. Furthermore, for 19 of the 36 dogs, the
hypothesis “Paw preference correlates to task performance”
holds in all 3 trials.
Regarding the initial position of the dog before
departure, a few additional remarks are to be made. If, e.g.,
the left front paw would be in front of the right front paw,
wouldn’t that make it more likely for the dog to depart with
right? Since the initial position of the dog is described in
enough detail in the annotation of the video images, the
automated checker was used to find out in how many cases
the dogs’ paws were not level and what happened in those
cases. Approximately 1/3 of the initial positions were
skewed, of which 1/2 departed with the paw that was
already in front.
As can be seen from Table 3 (variables paw-gender and
gender-performance), our results do not replicate the gender
differentiation found by Quaranta et al. (2004) and by Wells
(2004), which would warrant new avenues of research to
determine which other or other additional factors might play
a role. The inter-task dependency found by Wells might be
one such factor.
The last variable in Table 3, adult-performance, is not
significant (χ2=0.28, p<0.594), supporting the adequacy of
the test, in the sense that young dogs do not perform
significantly worse than adult dogs.

Conclusion
The main results of the paper support the hypothesis that
paw preference correlates to task performance: dogs
departing with left generally perform better than dogs
departing with right (χ2=37.69, p<0.001). Among the dogs
departing with right, the percentage that performs badly
remains more or less stable (87.3%), while among the dogs
departing with left it increases (12.5%, 16.7%, 55.6% in
subsequent trials). This phenomenon is interesting and
warrants further research. Why the stability in right, and the
shift in left?
Gender differentiation was not replicated by our data,
thus opening new avenues of research with other or other
additional factors to gain insight in the gender
differentiation found earlier. The task dependency found by
Wells (2004) might be such a factor. For example, our
definition of paw preference is ‘which paw hits the ground
first when the dog starts walking’, whereas in papers such as
(Wells, 2003; Quaranta et al., 2004) it is ‘which paw is used
by the dog to move objects off its head’.
As usual with correlations, the exact nature of the
correlation is not explained by the data. Many intermediate
concepts can play a role, all worthy of further research. An
example is the known effect of motivation on performance,
see, e.g., (Revelle, 1989). Interpreted in that light, the results
indicate that dogs that depart with left have a motivational
higher value for this task setting then the dogs departing
with right. Next steps in the research could, therefore, be to
systematically influence the motivation of the dogs to test
whether or not the correlation between paw preference and
performance is found again. Similarly, ways could be
studied to systematically influence paw preference, and
again test the correlation with performance.
Supposing that the correlation between paw and
performance is indeed explained by motivational aspects, a
next question is why the dogs are sometimes not motivated
to search for the goody. One line of research to answer this
question might be the social relationship of the dog with the
handler.
A final remark involves the possible impact of the
handler on the paw that the dogs use in the experiment.
Although we tried to make sure that the handler always
stood still when releasing the dog, in an exceptional case
(s)he might have influenced the particular paw with which
the dog left. In future work, the tapes will be thoroughly
inspected on this aspect.
