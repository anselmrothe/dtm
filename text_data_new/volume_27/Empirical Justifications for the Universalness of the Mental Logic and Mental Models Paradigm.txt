Abstract
Though there is a long-standing controversy between mental
logic theory and mental model theory in human deductive
reasoning, the two theories do share one general hypothesis:
that whether people reason by applying inference schemas or by
constructing mental models, these mental representations and
mechanisms should be universal across homo sapiens, which
implies that they should be available to speakers of different
languages. We examined this hypothesis by conducting a series
of experiments in Chinese, parallel to the empirical research
supporting mental logic (Yang, Braine, and O’Brien, 1998), and
to that supporting mental models (Yang and Johnson-Laird,
2000). The results show that the Chinese data sets are
significantly correlated with English data sets, indicating that
performance in Chinese and performance in English are likely to
be based on similar mental representations and mechanisms (in
tasks of deductive reasoning with quantifiers and predicates).

Introduction
While logic tells us what reasoning is, psychology of
reasoning studies how people reason. There are two major
competing approaches in psychology of deductive
reasoning: mental logic theory (Braine & O’Brien, 1998;
Rips, 1994) claims that people reason by applying
inference schemas, and mental model theory (JohnsonLaird & Byrne, 1991) claims that people reason by
constructing mental models. Though there is a longstanding controversy between the two (O’Brien, Braine,
& Yang, 1994; Johnson-Laird, Byrne, & Schaeken, 1994),
they share one general normative hypothesis: viz., that
whether people reason by applying inference schemas or
by constructing mental models, these mental
representations and mechanisms are universal across
homo sapiens, which means they should be available to
speakers of different languages. However, recently some
researchers have argued that there is a cultural difference
in systems of thought: a difference between Western

analytical cognition versus Eastern holistic cognition (Nisbett,
Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001).
There is a great deal of empirical evidence in the
psychological literature supporting both mental logic theory
(e.g., Yang, Braine, & O’Brien, 1998) and mental model
theory (e.g., Yang & Johnson-Laird, 2000). Both sets of
experiments in these examples were conducted in English.
This paper reports two sets of experiments conducted in
Chinese, strictly parallel to the above English counterparts. In
the following two sections, we report on the set of experiments
in Chinese based on mental logic theory first, and then based
on mental model theory.

Mental Logic
The theory
Mental logic theory claims that people reason by applying
inference schemas. An inference schema specifies the form of
an inference: Given information whose semantic
representation has the form specified in the schema, one can
infer the conclusion, whose form is also specified. Below is an
example:
All the children found some red beads.
The red beads were either round or square.
The round beads were plastic.
The square beads were wooden.
Did all the girls find either plastic or wooden beads?
Mental logic theory predicts that people solve this problem in
steps. Step 1 is to infer from the first premise that all the girls
got red beads. This step can be seen as a constant of the
inference schema called quantified modus ponens. Step 2 is to
consider the next three premises and infer that the red beads
are either plastic or wooden. This step is an instance of
another schema. Step 3 is to apply this schema again on the
two intermediate conclusions in Steps 1 and 2, and infer that
all the girls found either plastic or wooden beads; and this
leads to answer Yes to the question.

English Study

Chinese Study

Yang et al. (1998) provided empirical justifications for a
mental predicate logic by Braine (1998). This study was
conducted in English at New York University. It tested a
set of 10 inference schemas (see Table 1) by using a set of
64 monadic predicate problems and a parallel set of 64
dyadic predicate problems (Appendix 1 and Appendix 2,
in Yang et al., 1998) similar to the example above. All the
test problems involved so-called quantified predicate
reasoning soluble by applying the 10 inference schemas
given in Table 1. The number of schemas required by the
proposed solutions to these problems varies, from onestep to multiple steps. Subjects were instructed to rate the
degree of relative difficulty right after solving each
problem (on a 7-point scale). All the experiments were
individually administered. The overall accuracy out of
more than 13,000 responses was greater than 97%, which
allowed using the introspective ratings to estimate the
weight of the schemas. A parametrical model of 10
schema weights (see Table 2) generated from the
perceived difficulty ratings using the least-square method
proved to be highly reliable: the correlations between the
predicted problem difficulty using schema weights
generated from one sample and the perceived difficulty
rating from other samples were on average .93,
accounting for above 80% of variance.

We conducted a set of 5 experiments in Chinese at Zhongshan
University, China, by using the strict Chinese translations of
the original English problems and by following precisely the
same procedures as those used in the English experiments.
The results show that the overall accuracy was 93%, and all
the cross-language validations (i.e., correlations between
English weights and Chinese ratings, between Chinese
weights and English ratings, and between English weights and
Chinese weights) are above .90, accounting for more than 80%
of the variance. Table 2 shows the English weights and
Chinese weights. Figures 1 and 2 should make the comparison
more perspicuous.

Mental Models
The Theory
Mental model theory postulates that reasoners build models of
the situations described in premises. One doctrine at the heart
of model theory is the co-called Principle of Truth: Reasoners
normally represent what is true but not what is false due to
limited working memory. In one sense, mental models can be
seen as partial selections from formal semantics in logic. For
example, recall the familiar truth table for conditionals:
P
Q
If P then Q
True
True
True
True
False
False
False
True

False
False

By mental model theory, this table represents all
possibilities. The principle of truth has a two-level
constraint. At the first level, it says reasoners normally do
not represent falsities (or false possibilities). Thus, the
second row should be eliminated from the truth table. At the
second level, reasoners do not feel comfortable reasoning
with a false antecedent, and so do not represent such a
possibility explicitly; instead, they make some mental
footnotes as implicit models and only flesh them out when
really necessary. Thus, the mental models for a conditional
statement can be represented as this:
P

Monadic

that footnote the two possibilities with false antecedents.
By mental model theory, a statement is possibly true if it is
true according to at least one model, and it is necessarily
true if it is true in all mental models, given the premises.

English Study

Q

The Principle of True has lead to the discovery a robust
phenomenon in human reasoning: illusory inferences. For
example, suppose that the subject is given two premises,
and a preface says that only one of them is true. The logical
solution has to consider two cases: the first premise is true
and the second premise is false, and vice versa. Yang and
Johnson-Laird (2000) showed that individuals succumb to
illusions in inferences about what is possible, and what is
impossible, when they are given quantified assertions. The
phenomenon was predicted by model theory’s Principle of

…
It includes one explicit model that reflects the first row in
the truth table, and an implicit model denoted by three dots

2401

Truth, according to which reasoners take into account what
is true, but not what is false. For example, given the
following problem,
Only one of the following statements is true:
At least some of the metal beads are not blue; or
At least some of the blue beads are not metal.
Is it possible that none of the beads are blue?

Three quarters of the participants responded “Yes”, even
though the correct response is “No”. Yang et al. (2000)
examined 20 problems of the above kind. These problems
are given in Table 3 in symbolic forms. Half of the
problems are predicted as illusory inference (Yes/No,
No/Yes), and another half are control problems (Yes/Yes,

No/No). Each problem has two versions corresponding to
whether monadic predicates or dyadic predicates are
employed. Two experiments corroborated the occurrence of
such illusions. Experiment 1 showed that participants
erroneously inferred that impossible situations were
possible, and that possible situations were impossible, but
they performed well with control problems (i.e., the falsity
does not effect a correct response) based on the same
premises. Experiment 2 corroborated these findings in
inferences from assertions based on dyadic relations, such
as, “all the boys played with girls”. The results from
accuracy data are given in Table 3. This study was
conducted in English at Princeton University.

Chinese Study
Two experiments were conducted in Chinese at Zhongshan
University (China), parallel to the two experiments reported
in Yang and Johnson-Laird (2000). The Chinese
experiments used strict Chinese translations of the English
materials, the same instructions, and strictly followed the
same procedures. The results show the significant
correlation between Chinese data and English data
(Pearson’s r = .73 for Experiment 1, r =.59 for Experiment
2, and r = .66 overall, p<.01). English results and Chinese
results are given in Table 3, and Figures 3 and 4 show
scatter plots of the percentages of correct responses for each
problem form in Chinese and in English, respectively.

General Discussion
The comparison between English experiments and Chinese
experiments corroborated the prediction by both mental
logic and mental model theories that the mental
representations and mechanisms in human deductive
reasoning, either using mental logic or mental models, are
likely to be available across languages.
