Abstract
Here we demonstrate the mechanistic differences between
voluntary and involuntary switching of the perception of an
ambiguous figure. In our experiment, participants viewed a
3D ambiguous figure, the Necker cube, and were asked to
maintain one of two possible interpretations across four
different conditions of varying cognitive load. These
conditions differed in the instruction to freely view, make
guided saccades, or fixate on a central cross. In the fourth
condition, subjects were instructed to make guided saccades
while unambiguous versions of the stimulus were
intermittently flashed. Eye tracking measurements revealed
consistent differences between voluntary and involuntary
perceptual switching.

Introduction
In order to successfully interact with the environment, an
individual must have up-to-date information with which to
guide his or her behavior. However, an individual must be
able to maintain that perception of the environment long
enough to generate an appropriate response. Ambiguous
figures, such as the Necker Cube, pose an interesting
perceptual dilemma: more than one interpretation is possible
without the stimulus changing. Viewing of the stimulus
results in switching between these interpretations. In the
case of the Necker cube (Figure 1), the object may be
viewed as an upward facing cube (Figure 3a) or a downward
facing cube (Figure 3b).
For nearly two centuries, a large amount of research has
been devoted to uncovering the mechanisms underlying the
maintenance of and switching between different perceptions
of these ambiguous stimuli. Multiple theories have arisen to
explain these phenomena and span the range of bottom-up
to top-down mediated processes: switches result from neural
fatigue within regions subserving a given percept (Toppino
& Long, 1987), from guidance from a top-down drive to
search (Leopold and Logothetis, 1999), or from top-down
attempts to solve a perceptual question (Rock, 1975).
While earlier work focused on the measurement of
switching rates, more recently the availability of precise
eye-movement recording gave researchers a more detailed
insight into the underlying perceptual mechanisms. Eye
tracking is a powerful tool yielding multiple parameters
such as gaze position, saccade amplitude, saccade

2218

frequency, blink frequency, and pupil size, which have been
robustly correlated with cognitive function (see Rayner,
1998, for a review). Investigators utilizing this method have
examined the regions within ambiguous figures that receive
attention during a specific interpretation, as well as changes
in eye movement parameters that may specify the time of
switch.
For example, Ellis and Stark (1978) reported that
prolonged fixation duration occurs at the time of perceptual
switching. They also found regions within the Necker cube
that when fixated, bias perception towards a particular
interpretation of the cube. Pomplun, Ritter, and
Velichkovsky (1996) had subjects press and hold a button A
or B while perceiving interpretation A or B, respectively, of
various ambiguous images. They separated the obtained
eye-fixation positions into two groups, according to the
button that was being pressed during the fixation. For most
images it was found that subjects looked at distinct regions
in the pictures for interpretations A and B. Interestingly, the
distance of these two regions was maximal if the fixations
were not separated at the time of button presses, but at about
900 to 1000 ms before each button press. This finding
suggests that changes in low-level visual mechanisms
precede conscious perceptual switches by a substantial
amount of time. However, for line drawings such as the
Necker cube in which each line is equally important across
interpretations, no difference in eye movements between the
two interpretations was found.
More recent work by Ito et al. (2003) identified the eyemovement variables blink frequency, saccade frequency,
and saccade direction as sensitive to perceptual switching.
Moreover, the study attributed the finding by Ellis and Stark
(1978) of prolonged fixations during switches to biases
arising from an inadequate sampling frequency. Instead of
describing a single time point that defines the perceptual
switch, Ito et al. depict a process that extends over the range
of seconds. While changes in saccade direction were
specific to their stimulus, their finding of peaks in blink
frequency and saccade frequency occurring before and after
button pressing (to indicate the switch) gave new insight
into the underlying perceptual mechanisms.
However, one of the most fundamental and fascinating
aspects of viewing ambiguous images, namely subjects’
intentional control, has not been systematically studied with

these fine-grained methods. In order to comply with
instructions favoring switching or maintenance, individuals
can modulate their rates of perceptual switching (Toppino,
2003).
Therefore, the goal of the current study was to expand
upon previous work by examining the differences between
voluntary and involuntary perceptual switches between
interpretations of the Necker cube. If subjects are instructed
to maintain a given perspective, involuntarily switching to
the opposite view should require less cognitive effort than
making a voluntary switch back to the favored perspective.
This relationship should also be sustained across tasks of
increasing cognitive demand. We will use eye tracking in
order to obtain physiological responses reflecting cognitive
performance and to analyze their robustness across
experimental conditions. Specifically we will examine the
time course of blink frequency, saccade frequency, and
saccade amplitude across these two types of perceptual
switches.

Method
Participants
Ten students (3F; aged 21-35), from UMass Boston
participated in the experiment. They were paid for their
participation and did not have any information about the
nature of the study.

Apparatus
Eye movements were recorded with the SR Research Ltd.
EyeLink-II system, which operates at a sampling rate of 500
Hz and measures a subject’s gaze position with an average
error of 0.5 degrees of visual angle. Stimuli were presented
on a 21-inch Dell Trinitron monitor with a refresh rate of 85
Hz and a screen resolution of 1280 by 1024 pixels.

conditions 3 and 4, subjects were asked to maintain a

when they heard a tone.

Materials
Figure 1 shows the Necker cube stimulus as seen by the
subjects across all four conditions. Two interpretations, a
downward facing cube and an upward facing cube, are
possible. For two experimental conditions subjects were
asked to make saccades switching back and forth between
two specific vertices on the cube in time with a presented
tone. The arrow in Figure 2 shows the path of the saccades
the subjects were instructed to make. In another
experimental condition, unambiguous versions of the
Necker cube, which depicted the interpretation opposite to
the one that participant was to hold, were flashed every 5 s
(Figure 3).

Procedure
Before data was collected, participants received 30 minutes
of instruction regarding the tasks, orientation with the
response pad, and practice perceiving the two interpretations
of the Necker cube.

2219

Figure 3: The two unambiguous versions of the stimulus
showing the two possible interpretations of the Necker cube
are presented here (upward = a, downward = b). In
experimental condition 2, unambiguous stimuli were flashed
in place of the original Necker cube every 5 s.
The experimental design consisted of four conditions: 1)
the participant was instructed to view the stimulus and look
wherever he or she wishes (“Free Viewing”), 2) the
participant was instructed to fixate on a marker in the center
of the cube (“Fixation”), 3) the participant was instructed to
make alternating saccades to the two bottom left vertices in
time with a tone presented every 500 ms (“500ms
Saccades”), and 4) the instructions to the participant were

the same as in 3, but an unambiguous version of the
stimulus was flashed in place of the Necker cube every 5
seconds for a duration of 150 ms, coincident with the tone
presented every 500ms (“Flashing”). For constancy across
conditions, the tone was present in every condition, but
participants were instructed to ignore the tone during the
Free Viewing and Central Fixation trials.
The order of the conditions was randomized, and
between conditions participants received brief reminders as
to instructions for the upcoming task. For each condition
there were two 45-second trials, one in which they were to
hold the upward perspective and the other where they were
to hold the downward perspective. Half the subjects were to
hold the upward perspective in the first trial and the
downward perspective on the second trial. The reverse was
true for the other half of the subjects. Subjects indicated
which interpretation they were holding by pressing a
corresponding button on a game pad. Before each trial, the
eye tracker was re-calibrated using a single central fixation
target to sustain high precision of measurement.

experimental conditions (Figure 4). A two-way ANOVA
with factors “experimental condition” and “percept”
(voluntary vs. involuntary) revealed that, across all
conditions, the duration of perceptual switching intervals
was longer for voluntary than involuntary perception, F(1;
9) = 15.89, p < 0.005. The holding durations for the
involuntary percepts were similar across all conditions, and
so were the durations for the voluntary percepts, except for
the Flashing condition. In that experimental condition, the
mean duration for voluntary switches was significantly
shorter compared with the other conditions. However, due
to substantial individual differences across subjects, neither
the main effect of experimental condition nor the interaction
of the two factors reached significance, both Fs(3;27) <
2.04, ps > 0.1. This result demonstrates that subjects were
able to intentionally bias their perception in favor of the
instructed type of interpretation of the Necker cube.

Data Analysis

duration of intervals/s

Similar to Ito et al. (2003), a moving window technique was
used to analyze eye movement variables as functions of
time relative to button presses or flashes. To compute the
value of a variable at a certain relative time t, its average
value across all intervals from t – 1000 ms to t + 1000 ms
relative to the relevant event was determined. To derive the
graphs in the present paper, the center of this window was
moved in steps of 20 ms from -5000 ms to 5000 ms relative
to a button press, and from 0 to 5000 ms relative to a flash
in the Flashing condition. Blink frequency was measured as
the number of blinks per second, that is, the average number
of blinks found in the 2-second window, divided by 2.
Saccade frequency was measured analogously, and saccade
amplitude was determined as the average amplitude of all
saccades that were measured within a 2-second window.
For the purpose of statistical analysis, values of the same
variable were split into ten different bins according to their
time of measurement relative to button presses. The first bin
contained the data for the interval -5000 ms to – 4001 ms,
the second one the data from -4000 to -3001 ms, and so on,
and the tenth bin contained the data from 4000 to 4999 ms.
The three-way repeated measures analyses of variance
(ANOVAs) computed on the eye-tracking variables had the
factors “experimental condition” (4 levels: Free Viewing,
Fixation, 500ms Saccades, and Flashing), “type of switch”
(2 levels: voluntary and involuntary), and “relative time”
(10 levels, referring to the ten relative time intervals
described above). For the analysis of variables relative to
flashes, the ten time intervals were chosen to span the
interval from 0 ms to 5000 ms relative to the flashes.

Results and Discussion

voluntary (dark bars) and involuntary switches (light bars).
The close examination of eye movement parameters
across the two switch types, however, promised to be more
insightful than interval durations. Data were aligned relative
to the button press in order to investigate how these
parameters were modulated around the time of reporting of
a switch. Blink frequency, saccade frequency, and saccade
amplitude were determined for each of the four conditions
and separated for voluntary and involuntary switches.
The three-way ANOVA for blink frequency revealed a
main effect of relative time, F(9; 81) = 4.19, p < 0.001, and
a significant interaction between the factors relative time
and type of switch, F(9; 81) = 4.34, p < 0.001; no other
effects were found. These results indicate that blink
frequency is sensitive to perceptual switches, and that its
time course differs between voluntary and involuntary
switches. As can be seen in Figure 5, first column, blink
frequency increased around the time of button pressing
across all conditions. Interestingly, the blink frequency peak
for the voluntary switches always preceded those for
involuntary switches, explaining the significant interaction
between the factors relative time and type of switch.

across all conditions. Data occurring during voluntary switches (filled symbols) and involuntary switches (open symbols) are
shown relative to the time of the respective button press.
Although the factor experimental condition did not reach
significance, the diagrams suggest subtle differences across
conditions. During the Free Viewing condition, the effects
of voluntary and involuntary switches were of similar
strength, but with a large time difference between their
peaks (1000 ms before and after the button press,
respectively). For the Fixation condition, blink frequency
showed a rather similar time course between voluntary and
involuntary switches. The peaks in blink frequency for both
voluntary and involuntary switches occurred near the time

of button presses and were of similar magnitude. During the
500ms Saccades and Flashing conditions – the two saccadic
conditions - blink frequency was predominantly greater in
magnitude for involuntary switches than for voluntary
switches, and the first voluntary peak always clearly
preceded the elevation for involuntary switching. The
Flashing condition is unique in that it involves a periodic
stimulus manipulation imposing a systematic temporal
influence on the psychophysical data. Therefore, this
condition will receive a separate analysis below.

frequency was due to our method of using a 2-second
window for data analysis. It does not indicate subjects’
anticipation of the next flash, but an effect of temporal
averaging within the 2-second window. Through this
averaging, changes in variables that occur, for example, 200
ms after a flash still influence the data from 800 ms before a
flash (= 4200 ms after a flash) to 1200 ms after a flash.

All in all, the blink frequency data reveal a robust
divergence in time courses for voluntary and involuntary
switching, and they also suggest a divergence in magnitude
that varies across conditions. Blink frequency is known to
be inversely correlated with cognitive effort (e.g., Veltman
and Gaillard, 1998). In the present context, however, it is
unclear whether changes in blink frequency actually indicate
varying cognitive effort or rather the presence of other
mechanisms underlying perceptual switching. It is hard to
explain why cognitive effort should decrease around the
time of perceptual switches and button responses. At any
rate, the pattern of results suggests that voluntary and
involuntary switches involve different activation sequences
of underlying neural mechanisms.
This significant divergence in time course between
voluntary and involuntary switches carried over to saccade
frequency and amplitude parameters, though to a much
lesser extent. The three-way ANOVAs for these two
variables showed a significant main effect for the factor
experimental condition, both Fs(3; 24) > 30.06, ps < 0.001.
Moreover, for both variables the two-way interaction of
experimental condition and relative time, both Fs(27; 216) >
1.92, ps < 0.01, and the three-way interaction of
experimental condition, relative time, and type of switch,
both Fs(27; 243) > 1.79, ps < 0.05, were significant.
The main effect of the experimental condition is an
obvious consequence of the different instructions with
regard to subjects’ saccadic behavior. For example, Figure 5
shows that both saccade frequency (second column) and
amplitude (third column) were smaller in the Fixation
condition than in all other conditions. The significant twoway and three-way interactions demonstrate for both
saccade variables that their temporal behavior varied across
combinations of experimental condition and type of switch.
Generally fewer and shorter saccades occurred during
switches, but the opposite situation occurred during the
Fixation condition. This result suggests that perceptual
switching disrupts task performance and makes subjects
more likely to deviate from their assigned task. Taken
together, the findings with regard to saccade frequency and
amplitude yield further evidence for a differential
involvement of neural mechanisms in voluntary and
involuntary switches – voluntary switches have an earlier
effect on these variables than involuntary switches.
Finally, the Flashing condition needed to be analyzed in
a separate way. This condition was distinct from the others
in that there was a 5-second rhythm of the flashing of an
unambiguous cube, which represented a percept opposite to
the one participants were trying to maintain. We were
interested in examining how eye movement parameters and
button press times varied in temporal relation to these
flashes (Figure 6).
One-way ANOVAs with the factor relative time showed
no significant effect on saccade amplitude or saccade
frequency, both Fs(9; 81) < 1. Blink frequency, however,
was significantly influenced by the relative time, F(9; 81) =
7.33, p < 0.001. As can be seen in Figure 6, blink frequency
exhibited a strong modulation with a peak centered at 1000
ms following the flash, after which values steadily declined
to a minimum at 4200 ms. The following increase in

Figure 6. Time course of eye movement parameters and
response frequency relative to the time of the flash of the
unambiguous stimulus. From top to bottom: Blink
frequency, saccade frequency, and saccade amplitude data
represent pooled results from voluntary and involuntary
switching. Data for response frequency is divided between
voluntary (filled triangles) and involuntary (open triangles)
perceptual switches.

The time points of blink frequency maxima and minima
were well aligned with those for response frequency of
involuntary switches. The frequency of involuntary
perceptual reversals was highest approximately 1000 ms
after the unambiguous figure was flashed, and it was lowest
at around 4400 ms after a flash (= 600 ms before a flash).
For voluntary reversals, the peak occurred later and was less
pronounced. A two-way ANOVA with factors relative time
and type of switch revealed a significant main effect of
relative time on response frequency, F(9; 81) = 2.71, p <
0.05, and a significant interaction between the two factors,
F(9; 81) = 3.11, p < 0.01.
Taken together, the analysis of psychophysical data
relative to flashing the “unwanted” interpretation of the
cube demonstrated a strong bias of subjects’ perception
towards that interpretation. One second after a flash,
subjects are more than four times as likely to switch to the
involuntary percept as they are four seconds after a flash.
This effect of a brief 150 ms flash is unexpectedly strong. It
is also interesting to see that the average time from a flash to
the manual report of the corresponding percept is about
1000 ms. This corresponds to the delay between the start of
a perceptual switch – as indicated by eye-movement
parameters – and its manual report found by Pomplun and
colleagues (1996). A possible interpretation of this
correspondence is that, once triggered, the sequence of
neural mechanisms underlying perceptual switches takes
about 1000 ms to complete, minus some manual reaction
time. This seems to work in similar ways for externally and
internally triggered switches.
In summary, our most important finding is the evidence
for two distinct types of perceptual switching that occur
during viewing of an ambiguous figure. These switches
exhibit different time courses of underlying mechanisms
from one another with effects on eye-movement variables
occurring earlier during voluntary switches relative to
involuntary switches. The finding by Pomplun et al. (1996)
of changes in eye-movement variables preceding button
responses by 900-1000 ms was replicated in our study for

involuntary switches but not voluntary ones. One possibility
for this difference may be that the cognitive mechanisms
underlying perceptual switching are recruited actively and
thus more quickly during voluntary switches.
