Abstract

The Full ST2 model: Basic Principles

A reduced version of the Simultaneous Type Serial Token
Model is presented. This model embraces two theories of
temporal attention: Chun and Potter’s two-stage theory and
Kanwisher’s types-tokens theory. We explain the proposed
model and show how it reproduces key data from the
Attentional Blink phenomenon. In addition, we verify
experimentally predictions arising from the model.

Introduction
Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) has been used
extensively to explore how humans deploy attention over
time (Chun & Potter, 1995; Kanwisher, 1987; Raymond,
Shapiro, & Arnell, 1992; Weighelsgartner & Sperling 1987)
Prominent amongst RSVP tasks is the Attentional Blink
(AB), in which a decline in performance on a 2nd target
(hereafter the T2) is observed when it is presented within
between 100 and 500ms of the offset of a 1st target
(hereafter the T1) (Chun & Potter, 1995; Raymond et al.,
1992). Until recently, theoretical debates centred on
informal explanations of the blink, which included the 2stage model (Chun & Potter, 1995) and the Interference
theory (Shapiro et al., 1997). These informal explanations
have proved valuable in focusing formulation of
experimental questions. However, the maturity of the field
now makes it ripe for computational modelling.
Accordingly, a number of models have recently been
proposed (review: Bowman & Wyble, submitted).
The current paper focuses on the STST (Simultaneous
Type Serial Token) model (Bowman & Wyble, submitted;
Bowman, Wyble, & Barnard, 2004), for which we also use
the shorthand ST2. This paper reports the development of a
reduced version of the approach (called the reduced ST2
model), which abstracts from some of the implementation
details of the full model. Importantly though, the new
model remains consistent with the theoretical principles that
underlie the earlier ST2 incarnation.
The focus of both ST2 models is the letters-in-digits
paradigm (Chun & Potter, 1995), in which the subject’s task
is to report the two letter targets placed in a stream of digit
distractors. This experiment can be viewed as a canonical
AB methodology since no task switch is involved between
T1 and T2. The task originally used in (Raymond et al.,
1992) involved a task switch, and is therefore more
complex.
This paper serves to describe the reduced ST2 model, its
predictions, and, finally experimental verification of these
predictions. Before introducing the new model, we briefly
review necessary elements of the full ST2 model.

2371

The full ST2 model began as a rate-coded neural
network elaboration of the theoretical two-stage model
(Chun, 1997; Chun & Potter, 1995). The central idea
behind their conception of RSVP processing is that the 1st
stage can represent multiple items in parallel, but only for
a short time (several hundred milliseconds). The 2nd stage
is required for consolidation into a memory store that can
persist until the end of the trial. However the 2nd stage is
limited in its ability to process multiple items
concurrently. Therefore, in order to limit interference in
the 2nd stage, a gate is shut that denies entry to subsequent
items. While waiting to be processed, these items are
vulnerable to decay if they have been masked.
We agree with Chun (1997) that this model can be
well implemented using the types and tokens framework
described by Kanwisher (1987). In her theory, types
represent possible kinds of items, devoid of context. In
contrast, tokens represent memories that a given item was
encountered, i.e. episodic (instance specific) information
about the occurrence of an item. A token can be bound to
any combination of types within its domain.
In the case of the letters-in-digits task, types would
include all of the letters and digits, and one or more
tokens would be assigned to represent the occurrence of
the targets within an RSVP stream. The other key
difference between types and tokens is that the latter are
strictly sequential in nature, in that only one token may be
in the process of binding at any one time. Hence, the
name of our approach: Simultaneous Type, Serial Token.
Types can be considered analogous to stage 1 of the two
stage theoretical model, while our token implementation
is the analogue of stage 2.
Stage 1. The full ST2 model represented each potential
item (i.e. each type) in an RSVP stream with a unique
node that would be re-activated if the item occurred twice.
We implemented a series of layers that represented steps
of visual processing. At the 1st layer, distractors backward
masked targets via inhibitory connections. Remaining
activation from these masked traces reached the taskselective layer, at which the task demand system
emphasized targets.
Stage 2. Target(s) in stage-1 could activate a token gate in
stage-2, while strong lateral inhibition ensured only one
token could be active at any time. The remainder of the
token layer implemented dynamics, which insured, that
after being active for a sufficient amount of time
(approximately 200-300 msec), a token gate would be

heavily suppressed to allow a 2nd token to be activated.
While a token gate was active, it incrementally created
binding links to any active items in stage 1. The binding
links remained until the end of the trial, at which time they
could be used to reconstruct the items in stage-1 that had
been successfully encoded during that trial. In most cases, at
lag 1 (i.e. when T2 immediately follows T1), one token
would be bound to both T1 and T2. At lags 2-4 (i.e. when 1
to 3 distractors intervene between T1 and T2), one token
would be bound to T1 with T2 insufficiently bound for
retrieval. Beyond lag 4, after blink recovery, one token
would be bound to T1 and another to T2.
The Blaster. Data from Chua, Goh, & Hon (2001), suggest
that distractors immediately following the T1 are privileged
in their ability to prime a subsequent T2. This suggests that
attentional resources directed towards the T1 are not
specific to it, but rather to a time window encompassing T1
and other information presented within 100ms of its offset,
which includes the distractor immediately following T1.
Our model achieves this effect with a mechanism
designed to provide a brief burst of excitation to all type
representations, targets and distractors alike. Critically, this
mechanism is suppressed while a target is being processed.
This suppression protects a given target from interference
by subsequent information. This implementation sacrifices
T2 to protect T1.
In implementing an attentional resource within a neural
network model, it immediately becomes clear why a
mechanism of this sort might exist. Attentional resources
directed specifically at the T1 would require some form of
neural gating or phase-locking mechanism to restrict the
resource to the T1 itself. An alternative implementation
would involve many separate attentional mechanisms, one
allocated to every possible target.
The blaster, on the other hand, can be implemented with
a single node that spans the entire set of types. It is rarely
the case that humans encounter items presented for as brief
periods of time as are involved in the RSVP, therefore, the
fact that this attentional resource can inadvertently spill over
into subsequent distractors in this paradigm, would tend not
to occur in real world situations. In fact, as suggested by
experimental data we will later present, most of the benefit
of this resource seems to arrive on the T1+1 slot, resulting
in strong lag-1 sparing, and specific deficits in T1 when T2
is presented at lag-1.
The simplicity of this implementation allows us to
consider neural biological candidates, chief among which is
the Locus Coreleus (LC), a tiny structure that distributes
noradrenaline to the entire cortex in short bursts. An
alternative model of the LC’s putative role in causing the
attentional blink is described in Nieuwenhuis et al (in press).
An additional benefit of this mechanism is that it
provides a single nodal point for closing the “attentional
gate”, required to limit access to the 2nd stage. While a token
is in the process of being bound, a strong inhibitory
projection disables the blaster, forbidding it from assisting a
T2 that falls within the blink window (generally lags 2-4).

Thus, a principle of the ST2 model is that there is only one
pulse of attentional enhancement per tokenization.

The Reduced ST2 Model
We now move to discussion of the Reduced ST2
model (Figure 1a), which is essentially the task selective
layer, token gates, shutoff layer (which has not yet been
discussed) and blaster of the full model. It is primarily the
interaction of these parts that drive the temporal dynamics
of the blink data that we will model. The extra layers in
the full model provided functionality that is replaced in
the reduced model by procedural code. Additionally,
nodes representing the processing of distractors have been
removed. These nodes were primarily involved in
masking targets in the full model. Their functional role is
now represented by a reduction in the strength of targets
presented to the model.
In eliminating these nodes and reducing the time
resolution of the simulation, we have vastly reduced the
parameter space, and can run simulations at several
hundredfold the speed of the more complex model.
Unfortunately space does not permit us to elaborate the
function of our model to the extent required to replicate it
in detail. Instead we will focus our discussion on the
theoretically salient points of its operation.
Operation. In testing this model, targets are presented to
the T1 and T2 nodes at lags varying from 100 to 800 msec
in 100 msec intervals, with time steps of 20 msec. Both
T1 and T2 vary systematically in strength, reflecting
natural variation in the featural distinctiveness of the
different letters from the digit distractors, i.e. some letters
appear to be more or less effectively masked by digits.
Each lag in the modelled blink curve is a compilation of
model accuracy across every possible combination of T1
and T2 strength at that lag. It is this variance in strength
that explains why some T2’s are able to survive the blink,
and some T1’s are missed entirely.
Later in the paper we will talk in terms of strong and
weak targets, referring to putative differences in their
inherent featural strength. For purposes of the model we
designate weak targets as being the lower half of the
variance applied to an item, and strong targets as being
the upper half of this variance. Normally, targets vary
between 2.5 and 5.1, so weak targets range from 2.5 to
3.8. Targets in the T1+1 and T2+1 blank condition
(discussed below) vary from 7.5 to 10.1.
A critical distinction exists between the temporal
relationship of types and tokens. Namely, types (for T1
and T2) are allowed to be coactive (barring the weak
lateral inhibition that reduces, but does not generally
eliminate coactivation), while tokens are restricted to
being sequentially active. Token 2 is only permitted to be
active if token 1 has reached its threshold and been shut
down. This behaviour was implemented by the token
trace layer in the full ST2 model, but is dictated explicitly
within the procedural code in this version.

can occur even at lag-1 when T1 and T2 are particularly
strong.

Shutoff nodes. We have not yet discussed the shutoff
nodes, but they are essential in preventing a strong type
from being tokenised multiple times. Gradually accruing
activation in the shutoff nodes can cross a threshold,
releasing a strong inhibitory projection onto their associated
type nodes. Nodes of this sort can cause repetition
blindness, see (Bowman & Wyble, submitted).
Blaster. The Blaster adds a small amount of activation to
both T1 and T2 for 100 msec, which is enough to ensure an
extended and amplified activation of a target that has
recently been presented, but is insufficient to cause an item
that has not been presented to be tokenized. This input of
the Blaster to the type layer nodes is delayed by 80 msec.
The Blaster has a refractory period of 250 milliseconds, and
is suppressed by tokenization, see Figure 1a,b.
Binding. When at least one type node is coactive with a
token, binding links are incrementally formed from that
token to the type node. If two types are active, they will
both receive binding links. The rate at which each link
builds is proportional to the strength of the type node to
which it projects. These links have no functional role in the
encoding dynamics of the model and so are not present in
Figure 1a. They are only considered at retrieval.
Performance evaluation. Performance is evaluated
following 1500 msec of simulated time by testing the
strength of binding links. Furthermore, binding links are
only considered at retrieval if their associated token
managed to be “completed” (i.e. crossed a threshold) during
the presentation of targets. When two targets are retrieved,
their temporal order is reconstructed probabilistically by
considering the relative strength of binding links to T1 and
T2 type nodes from tokens 1 and 2, even if those links are
below threshold. Consequently, at lag-1, even though T2 is
bound strongly to token 1 along with the T1, a slight degree
of binding to token 2 will improve the chance of correctly
recalling order. Weak, subthreshold bindings to Token 2

Functional dynamics
The functional characteristics of the reduced ST2
model can be divided into three segments based on T2
lag: pre blink (lag 1), blink (lags2-4), and post blink (lags
5-8), see figure 1b.
Preblink. T2’s presented immediately after T1 receive
the full benefit of the Blaster, and thus, T1 and T2 are
active simultaneously. There is some diminution of both
as a result of the lateral inhibition, but they both remain
active enough to be bound to a single token.
Blink. At lags 2-4, the blaster provides attentional
enhancement in response to T1, which spills over to T2.
However, this T2 activity has decayed by the time the T2
itself is presented. Furthermore, because the T2 arrives
during or just after the tokenization of T1, the Blaster is
unavailable to be fired a 2nd time. Thus, the T2 decays
away without being tokenised and is thereby missed.
Post Blink. Presentation of the T2 at lags 5-8 is
sufficiently late that tokenization of the T1 type is
complete before T2 has decayed, and therefore the T2 is
processed in like manner as are T1s, see Figure 1b.
Swaps. One of the strengths of this model is that it is
capable of exhibiting ancillary effects of the AB, which
are shown in Figure 2a,b. When T2s are presented at lag1, both targets are bound to the same token. Thus, one of
the main functions of the token system, i.e. recording the
order of the presentation of items, is impaired. Hence, at
lag-1, the model exhibits swaps: an inability to correctly
recall the order of T1 and T2. This tendency in human
subjects can be seen in (Chun & Potter, 1995).
T1 and T2 strength manipulations. If a blank is placed
in the distractor stream at position T1+1, the blink is
attenuated (Chun & Potter, 1995). Our model exhibits the
2373

same dynamic, see Figure 2a. A T1 that is unmasked by a
missing distractor is presumed to cause a stronger activation
strength, in accord with the full ST2 model. This stronger
trace drives the token system to a more rapid completion,
allowing T2’s to more easily outlive the blink. T2+1 blanks
also allow T2’s to outlive the blink, by evoking a very
strong T2 trace that can be tokenised despite arriving during
the blink. The Blaster is not necessary for tokenization of
these stronger traces.
T1 Performance. The model correctly demonstrates a drop
in T1 performance at lag-1, as a result of the interference of
T2, see Figure 2b. The inhibition between T1 and T2
reduces the strength of the T1 node, and thus, its binding
strength.

T2|NOT_T1 is equal to 92% at lag 1, compared to a
normal lag-1 score of 81% for T2|T1. Baseline
performance for T1 as well as T2|T1 at lag-8 is 85%.
Prediction 3: Labile Attention. In accord with Potter
Staub & O’Conner (2002), our model predicts a changing
relationship between T1 and T2 at different lags. When
targets are separated by less than 200 msec, there is direct
inhibition between the two simultaneously active type
representations, hence strong T1’s reduce T2 performance
relative to weak T1’s. At later lags, the attentional gate
has closed, it is too late for T2 to be joined to Token 1. If
T2 is encoded from lag3 onward, it will be bound to
Token 2. Stronger T1’s mean that Token 2 will be
available more rapidly, thereby attenuating the blink.
Figure 2e illustrates this pattern from the model. Weak
T1s allow better T2 performance at early lags (1-2) due to
reduced interference. Conversely, strong T1s evoke a
much sharper and more rapid blink, that recovers more
quickly.

Predictions
Having explained the relevant dynamics of the model
and fit several sets of data, it is incumbent on us to make
predictions that we may be able to verify empirically. In
discussing performance, T2|T1 will refer to T2 accuracy for
those trials in which T1 was recalled. T2|NOT_T1 will refer
to T2 accuracy for trials in which T1 was missed.
Prediction 1: The blink is temporal. Implicit within the
design of our model is the assumption that the function of
distractors is primarily to cause masking effects, weakening
the target representations (Giesbrecht & Di Lollo, 1998).
Accordingly, our model predicts that the blink is a function
of the temporal relationship of targets in the stream, and not
the number of intervening distractors. Consequently, if one
doubles the rate of presentation of items, the AB effect will
reflect the temporal relationship between the targets, not the
sequential relationship. For RSVP streams presented at 50
msec per item, at lag-2 the T2 is following the T1 by 100
msec, and therefore, should exhibit complete sparing.
Furthermore, at this faster rate the blink curve will recover
by lag 12, instead of lag 6. We model this by using only
weak T1 and T2 items, assuming that the 50 msec SOA will
reduce bottom-up trace strength through enhanced masking.
Model results are shown in Figure 2c.
Prediction 2: Increased T2 lag 1 performance with
missed T1. The second prediction concerns the fate of T2s
on trials in which the T1 was missed. In our model, this can
occur because the T1 was too weak to be encoded,
especially at lag 1 when T1 and T2 overlap most strongly.
Despite being too weak to be encoded, the T1 still activates
the Blaster, with resultant amplification of both the T1 and
T2 traces. Recall that the arrival of the Blaster response is
delayed, and amplifies the item in the following slot more
fully than the item that triggered it. Therefore, a T2 at lag-1
for which the T1 was very weak, is going to receive a
stronger amplification than it would have in isolation (i.e.
analogous to the lag-8 case in which the T1 and T2 are
temporally isolated). Consequently, when examining T2
trials for which T1 was missed, we find performance at lag1 to be superior to baseline performance (as measured at
lag-8, which is commonly equivalent for both T1 and T2).

Experimental Verification
Methods
To test these predictions we performed a letters-indigits AB study. MATLAB v6.5 and the psychophysics
toolbox (psychophysicstoolbox.org) were used to present
trials to subjects on a Windows 2000 computer. Display
timing rates were confirmed with photodiodes. 24
subjects were positioned in front of a 17” computer
screen, displaying a white background, upon which black
letters in 180 point Arial font were used as targets. Black
digits in 220 point Arial were used as distractors. Two
experiments were designed with different stimulus onset
asynchronies. The 2nd was designed primarily to address
prediction 1, but will also be cited to address 2 and 3.
After each trial, subjects were asked by a screen
prompt to report the identity of the letters and the order in
which they had seen them. Subjects were also advised to
guess if they were not sure, but not to guess blindly.
Despite this instruction, reversals of T1 and T2 by the
subjects were not considered incorrect in the analyses.
Temporal order of the response was only considered for
the analysis of swaps.
Experiment 1: For 14 subjects, items were presented for
95 msec, followed immediately by the next item. RSVP
streams were 18 items in length. T1 could appear in slots
5 to 8, while T2 could appear from lags 1-8 afterwards. At
least 4 distractors followed T2.
With equal probability, items could have a blank in the
T1 +1 slot, the T2 +1 slot, or no blank at all. Trial types
were crossed in an 8x3 paradigm, with lag and blanks as
primary factors. There were 144 trials per block, with
three blocks per subject and 14 catch trials with no T2.
Experiment 2: For 10 subjects, items were presented for
45 msec, followed immediately by the next item. RSVP
streams were 40 items long. T1 could appear in slots 9 to

the number of trials for the NOT_T1 conditions is fairly
small and the values are approaching ceiling.
In experiment 2 the effect is more pronounced. At 100
msec (which is lag-2 in this experiment) performance for
T2|NOT_T1 was 83%, well above both the baseline
performance (60%) and sparing (68%) for the T2|T1

T2|T1 conditions was significant (T-Test p< .05, 2 tailed).

curves resemble those of prediction 2 qualitatively (not
shown due to space restrictions), but are too close to be

For experiment 2, the difference between strong and
weak items was inherently greater (82% and 50% baseline
rates). Consequently, the strong/weak T1 manipulation
caused blink curves that matched the prediction well. Weak
T1’s shifted the deepest point of the blink from 300 msec to
400 msec, allowing more sparing at 100 and 200 msec.
Conversely strong T1’s caused a blink with a deepest point
at 200 msec, see Figure 2f. T2|T1 performance at 200 msec
lag was significantly better in the weak T1 condition (T-Test
p < .007 2 tailed)

T2 at these lags, due to a longer binding duration. We feel
that these results add a new temporal dimension to
theoretical considerations of the AB. Our work suggests
that there are two different means by which T1 and T2
interfere with one another. At early lags, there is direct
interference between the targets, in line with the early
hypothesis of (Raymond et al., 1992). At later lags, the
system behaves as the two-stage model of (Chun &
Potter, 1995).

Discussion
We have presented a reduced ST2 model that we believe
captures the most salient aspects of the AB. This model can
produce the following effects: changes in T1 performance,
T1/T2 order inversions, and attenuation of the blink curve
by blanks after T1 and T2. Our model also generated a
series of predictions, which we were able to verify
empirically.
We predict that the blink is temporal in nature. The
influence of distractors is primarily in causing low-level
masking of targets. Accordingly, it is the SOA between
targets that is of primary importance in determining the
characteristics of the blink. In our experiment, subjects
exhibit lag-2 sparing at a rate of 20 items/sec that is nearly
identical (relative to baseline levels of performance) to the
time course of the 10 item/sec blink curve.
Our model describes a method of attentional
enhancement that creates a temporal window surrounding a
target, but is not specific to its identity. The verification of
prediction 2 strongly supports this hypothesis, as it is
difficult to imagine how T2 performance at 100 msec lag in
the T2|NOT_T1 could be elevated well above the
performance baseline for a T2 alone if it did not receive
some kind of enhancement from T1.
Our model goes on to make a prediction concerning the
changing nature of the relationship between T1 and T2 at
different lags, and the predominantly temporal nature of the
blink. Specifically, up to about 200ms post T1, the two
targets directly compete with one another such that stronger
T1s impair T2 more than weak T1’s. At lags of 300-500ms,
this relationship changes. T1 and T2 no longer directly
compete. In fact a weak T1 causes a greater impairment of
