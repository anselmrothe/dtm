the relationship between expectation and surprise is not quite
so clear-cut. We examine the hypothesis that a surprising
event is unexpected relative to a reader’s mental
representation of the sequence. In other words, when reading
a story, a person’s level of surprise should be determined by
whether or not the specific conditions supporting the
surprising event were built into their representation as the
prior narrative was comprehended.

Abstract
This paper describes two novel experiments that investigate the
cognitive basis of surprise in stories depicting simple, everyday
events. Participants were asked to read a number of short
scenarios, each of which concluded with some surprise event
for the central protagonist. The story versions differed in how
strongly they predicted this ‘surprise’ conclusion, by varying
the degree of attention drawn to key enabling conditions for
that conclusion. The effect of this manipulation on participants’
surprise ratings, and the speed with which they read the final
sentence, were used as dependent measures. The results of our
experiments show that the specific representations built by
people in understanding the earlier part of a story have definite
effects on their level of surprise at later events. Furthermore, the
pattern of reading times for the target sentences supports the
explanation given for these differences. We discuss the
consistency of these findings with theories of discourse
comprehension and describe how such effects might be
modelled computationally.

Surprise and Expectations
At a cognitive level, surprise is intuitively related to
expectations, and as such the Oxford English dictionary
defines it as “an unexpected occurrence or event”. However,
this may not be a straightforward relationship due to differing
interpretations of what it means to expect something. Teigen
& Keren (2003) observe that in cognitive psychology,
expectations are usually quantified in terms of probabilities;
i.e. an unexpected event is considered to be a low probability
outcome. Yet, events that have an equal likelihood of
occurring are not always judged to be equally surprising by
an observer (e.g. Schackle, 1969). Surprise then, might not be
due to the low probability of an outcome, but to its degree of
contrast with a more likely, but disconfirmed, expectation.
The Expectancy-Disconfirmation hypothesis, (Meyer
Reisenzein & Schützwohl, 1997), similarly suggests that
surprise is experienced when expectations based on
preexisting schemas fail to be confirmed. If we apply these
ideas to the area of discourse comprehension, then surprise is
likely to occur when a predicted sequence of events in a story
is violated or deviated from in a significant way.
While little research has investigated the conditions which
evoke surprise in narrative, a lot of work has examined
people’s ability to form forward inferences during reading
(e.g., Klin et al., 1999; McKoon & Ratcliff, 1986). These
inferences operate by linking representations of the text with
background knowledge to predict a likely outcome, thus
facilitating the comprehension process. It seems feasible that
when people read a familiar event sequence in a story, they
are able to make predictions about what will happen next.
According to Schank & Abelson (1977), this is done by
means of script-based schemas. For example, when reading
the scenario “The cup of coffee was balanced on the arm of
the chair. Suddenly, Richard sneezed.”, most people can
predict that Richard’s sneeze will cause the cup of coffee to
spill or be knocked off the chair. If the reader subsequently
discovers that a cat on Richard’s knee jumps up and scratches
him, they will probably be surprised at this ending, as, despite

Introduction
As well as being one of the most basic and universal of
emotions, surprise has long been recognised as a fundamental
building block of human cognition (Darwin, 1872; Ekman,
1972). Despite this, cognitive investigations of surprise,
which move beyond the physiological and affective domain,
have only recently emerged (e.g. Fisk, 2002; Schützwohl,
1998; Teigen & Keren, 2003). The occurrence of surprise in
narrative comprehension presents a good starting point for
tackling this complex phenomenon, as it is undoubtedly an
important and central aspect of many stories. Surprise, for
instance, has been shown to be vital in determining the
perceived interestingness of a piece of text (e.g. Iran-Nejad,
1987; Kim, 1999); very few best-sellers describe the hero
going to the office, working all day and then coming home
and going to bed. Instead, writers often maintain a reader’s
interest with well-timed surprises; for instance, Raymond
Chandler’s murder discovery scenes often describe the dead
body obliquely (e.g., a brown loafer protruding from the
curtain), so that the reader’s surprise at discovering the
referent (i.e., that the shoe is attached to a corpse) mirrors the
detective’s surprise at discovering the body.
In this paper, we try to elucidate the cognitive basis of
surprise in understanding narrative. Evidently, a person
should be surprised when something unexpected occurs in an
event sequence. However, as discussed in the next section,

power to control the amount of information given to the
reader about an upcoming surprise, and subtle differences in
narration can have a great impact on the reader’s
representation of events. For example in murder mysteries, if
a room is described as having a gun hanging over the
mantelpiece, there is often an inevitability about its
subsequent use. We could say that in such cases, readers can
‘predict’ the surprise, since the enabling conditions for an
expectation have been built into their representation.

being plausible, it does not fit in well with the expected causal
sequence.
Grimes-Maguire & Keane (2004) asked people to provide
either a predictable or a creative ending to simple twosentence scenarios like the above example. It was found that
even when participants were told to be creative, they were
constrained by their background knowledge, as the endings
they gave to the scenarios overlapped significantly with those
generated by people asked to give predictable endings. This
suggests that participants found it quite difficult to avoid
considering the typical outcomes to such sequences, even
when they were instructed to provide novel endings.
However, Grimes-Maguire & Keane (2004) explicitly asked
participants to form an expectation, so this work does not
address the issue of whether readers automatically anticipate
events during reading, i.e. by making a forward inference.
Some researchers propose that such ‘on-line’ expectations are
rarely formed, because making predictions about events that
may never happen is an uneconomical reading strategy
(McKoon & Ratcliff, 1986). Nevertheless, a wealth of
empirical evidence has suggested that under certain
conditions people do make forward inferences (e.g. Calvo,
2000; Fincher-Kiefer, 1996; Klin et al., 1999). The emerging
consensus today is that readers can anticipate outcomes, but
only in highly predictable scenarios. For example, when
reading the sentence “He threw the delicate porcelain vase at
the wall” most will infer that “the vase broke” (Klin et al,
1999).
If we assume a direct relationship between expectation and
surprise, then readers should only experience surprise when
an explicitly represented, highly predictable event in a
discourse fails to subsequently occur (leading to a
disconfirmed expectation). This also means that the degree to
which a reader’s story representation supports a prediction, as
mediated by events in the preceding discourse, should
critically influence their level of perceived surprise at future
unfolding events. This is the hypothesis tested by the current
research.

Overview of Experiments
We wished to establish whether a reader’s surprise is related
to the degree to which they can represent expectations about
the end event in a story. Few previous studies have examined
both of these factors together. We devised a variety of short
scenarios which differed in how strongly they set up the final,
‘surprising’ sentence (Experiment 1). The dependent
variables were the time taken to read the concluding sentence
(to determine whether the appropriate forward inference had
been made) and a rating of surprise for the ending. Three
variants of the story scenario were used: Predictable, Neutral
and Unpredictable. We hypothesised that participants would
register progressively more surprise across these conditions in
the order shown, even though we envisaged that the relevant
explicit forward inference would only be made in the
Predictable condition. We also examined what happened
when an enabling condition for the concluding sentence was
‘undone’ (Exp. 2)

Experiment 1
In this experiment we manipulated the amount of information
that was given to the reader about an upcoming surprise for
the central protagonist. We did this by creating short
scenarios in which only the second sentence was changed in
each version. This sentence varied in how strongly it
predicted the story ending. There were three different
conditions: 1) Predictable, in which the sentence described a
specific event for enabling the surprise conclusion for the
protagonist, 2) Neutral, in which the sentence hinted at the
upcoming surprise by containing vague information about the
enabling event, and 3) Unpredictable, which did not include
any information about the enabling condition, instead
describing some irrelevant event. The difference between
these three conditions is illustrated in the sample scenario in
Table 1.

Expecting a Surprise
In examining this hypothesis, there is one further issue that is
unique to surprise in discourse comprehension. Readers who
form expectations in the story context are probably operating
off at least two distinct types of knowledge:
(i) Knowledge about the causal structure of the world derived
from direct and vicarious experience (e.g. Trabasso & van
den Broek, 1985)
(ii) Knowledge of story structure (e.g. Stein & Glenn, 1979).

Pre-test
Before the main experiment, it was necessary to carry out a
pre-test in order to ensure that the three conditions differed
significantly in how strongly they predicted the story
conclusion. Fifteen participants were presented with a booklet
containing 20 short stories in each of their three versions
(Predictable, Neutral and Unpredictable). Participants were
then instructed to rate each version of the story for how
strongly they felt it predicted the final sentence on a scale of
1-7 (with 1 denoting a very unpredictable ending and 7
denoting a very predictable ending). A one-way, repeated

It seems likely that these two types of knowledge drive
comprehension, influencing the reader’s representation, and
determining whether or not a forward inference will be made.
Rapp & Gerrig (2002) have provided evidence for a
comparable distinction between ‘reality-driven’ and ‘plotdriven’ analysis in reading. In practice, this means that in the
story context, readers are more sensitive to depicted details
that may set up subsequent surprises. The author has the

analysis (e.g., miss-keyed presses). Also, in the reading time
data, responses deemed too fast (i.e. below 300ms) or too
slow (i.e. above 10000ms) were omitted. Any responses that
were above 3 standard deviations of a participant’s mean
response time were excluded as well. This resulted in a total
of 5% of the data being omitted from the analysis.

Method

As expected, participants’ surprise ratings systematically
varied with the degree of attention given to the enabling
condition for the surprising event. Furthermore, the reading
time data supports the proposal that forward inferences are
only made in predictable situations.

Results

Participants Thirty-six people (aged between 20-58 yrs)
voluntarily participated in the experiment.
Materials Eighteen short stories were randomly selected
from the original set of 20 used in the pre-test. Each story was
five sentences long with the fifth sentence depicting an
ending to the scenario. The different conditions were
determined by changing the second sentence accordingly, as
can be seen in Table 1. The final sentence in each story was
modified to be 10-11 syllables long, thus allowing us to make
reliable comparisons of reading times across the materials.

Surprise ratings Figure 1 shows the mean surprise ratings
given across the three conditions. A one-way, repeated
measures ANOVA revealed a significant difference between
these conditions, using both participants (F1(2,70) = 60.518; p
< 0.001; MSe = 0.407) and materials (F2(2,34) = 21.353; p <
0.001; MSe = 0.563) as random factors. Post-hoc analysis
showed that all three conditions differed significantly; the
endings of the Predictable stories were judged as the least
surprising (M = 2.806), followed by the Neutral (M = 3.819)
and then the Unpredictable (M = 4.444) story endings. Nonparametric analysis using Page’s trend test revealed a reliable
trend for the Predictable < Neutral < Unpredictable ordering
of conditions by-participants (L1(2) = 487; p <0.001), and bymaterials (L2(2) = 238; p <0.001).

Procedure and Scoring Instructions for the task were
displayed on a computer screen, as follows: “You will be
asked to read a number of short stories (each with 5
sentences). These will be presented sentence-by-sentence on
the screen. When you have finished reading a sentence, press
the spacebar to display the next sentence. Please read each
story carefully. At the end of each story you will be asked
how surprising you found the final sentence. You can do this
by choosing a number between 1 and 7, where 1 means a very
unsurprising sentence and 7 means a highly surprising
sentence.” Below these instructions was a depiction of a 7point scale, which ranged from 1 (Very Unsurprising) to 7
(Highly Surprising). After reading the instructions, the
participants were given a practice trial, which consisted of
two stories in the same format as the main experiment. On
completion of the practice trial, they commenced the
experiment. The stories were presented in a different random
order to each participant.
Error responses were excluded from the data prior to

Reading times for concluding sentence It was expected that
the reading times for the story ending would reflect forward
inferences made about the surprising event. If the early
sentences strongly suggest a particular outcome, then that
outcome should be partially or wholly represented, making
reading times for the concluding sentence faster. A one-way
ANOVA repeated measures did reveal a reliable main effect
of condition by-participants (F1(2,70) = 4.971; p<0.05; MSe =
321627.5), but not by-materials (F2(2,34) = 2.582; p>0.05;
MSe = 291331.8). However, pairwise comparisons using a
one-tailed dependent t-test revealed a significant difference
between the Predictable and Neutral conditions across both
participants (t1(35) = 2.5216; p <0.01) and materials (t2(17) =
2.076; p <0.05). This difference was also observed between
the Predictable and Unpredictable conditions (t1(35) = 3.189;

television (see Table 2). In our second experiment, we tested
this hypothesis by examining the effects of such an ‘Undoing’
condition with the Predictable and Neutral conditions. We
expected that the increasing trend in surprise should be as
follows: Predictable < Neutral < Undoing. On the issue of
reading times for the concluding sentence, as in Experiment
1, we expected the Predictable condition to yield faster times
than both the Neutral and Undoing conditions, because the
representation of stories in this condition should induce
forward inferences.

p<0.01; t2(17) = 1.799; p<0.05). The Neutral and
Unpredictable conditions did not differ. This shows that
overall, the mean reading times for the Predictable condition
(M = 3106.05) were reliably different to both the Neutral (M
= 3298.31) and Unpredictable (M = 3445.31) conditions.

Suddenly, he sneezed.

The results of Experiment 1 show that varying the type of
information given about an enabling event for the story
conclusion had a significant impact on the reader’s
representation of the scenario. The three different conditions
resulted in qualitatively different surprise ratings for the same
ending. Also readers were faster to read the conclusion in the
Predictable condition, which suggests that they were making
forward inferences about what was about to happen. This
result is notable given that the only difference between the
stories was the second sentence, which had the same number
of syllables in each condition and which contained no
contradictory information across the three versions.
The most interesting finding of this experiment is that
surprise and expectancy do not appear to have a linear
relationship. While readers only seem to form an ‘on-line’
expectation in highly predictable scenarios (as illustrated by
faster reading times of the conclusion), they can nevertheless
experience qualitatively different levels of surprise across the
three conditions.

Method
Participants Fifty-nine undergraduate Computer Science
students from University College Dublin (17-20 yrs)
participated in this experiment for partial course credit.
Materials Fifteen stories were used based on the stories in
Experiment 1 (the remaining three were difficult to modify to
meet the constraints of this experiment). Each story had six
sentences, where the second and third sentence varied in each
condition. In the Predictable and Neutral conditions the
second sentence was the same as the analogous conditions in
the previous experiment, while the third sentence included
irrelevant information that did not relate to the story
conclusion (this was to ensure that all versions of the story
were the same length). In the Undoing condition, sentence 2
was the same as in the Neutral version of the story, while
sentence 3 undid the events of the second sentence, as can be
seen in Table 2. We also included a comprehension question
for each scenario to ensure participants would read the story
carefully.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 1, it is worth noting that the surprise ratings
given for the Neutral condition (which provides a generalised
enabling condition for the surprise event) sit roughly midway
between those given for the Predictable condition (which
provides the key enabling condition) and the Unpredictable
condition (which gives little indication of an enabling
condition). Presumably, reading stories in the Neutral version
leads to some representation of the enabling condition for the
outcome event, hence the reduced level of surprise. If this
proposal is true, then it should be possible to increase
perceived surprise in the Neutral condition if we explicitly
undo that enabling event. For example, by saying “John went
to turn on the TV” we might imply to the reader that John has

Design As in Experiment 1, the design was WithinParticipants, where each participant was randomly assigned to
read fifteen stories: five Predictable, five Neutral and five
Undoing scenarios.
Procedure and Scoring The procedure was the same as that
used in Experiment 1, with the addition that participants were

their surprise rating. This question required a yes or a no
answer, indicated by pressing Y or N on the keyboard. As
before, participants were given a practice session and all
materials were randomly ordered. Following the procedure in
the first experiment, 3.1% of the total data was discarded
prior to analysis.

General Discussion
The aim of this research was to explore the cognitive basis of
surprise in understanding simple stories. The results indicate
that target events will be judged as surprising relative to the
degree to which they are specifically supported in a reader’s
representation. This is achieved by the presence of enabling
conditions and forward inferences. In our Predictable story
versions, an explicit forward inference appears to be made
about the concluding event, making it less surprising, and
quicker to read. In our Neutral versions, a forward inference
does not appear to be made (reading times are much slower),
but the presence of implicit enabling conditions in the
representation impacts the surprise ratings given. When these
enabling conditions are absent (as in the Unpredictable
condition), or undone (as in the Undoing condition), overall
surprise ratings are the highest. These results are quite
consistent with models of comprehension and are currently
the focus of computational modelling work being carried out
by the authors.

examining the surprise ratings showed a main effect of

0.627; p<0.0001) as random factors. Page’s trend test also
revealed a significant trend for the ordering across the
conditions (Predictable < Neutral <Undoing) for participants
(L1(2) = 772.5; p<0.001), and materials (L2(2) = 199; p
<0.001). As in Experiment 1, the Predictable condition
induced the lowest surprise rating (M = 3.07) followed by the
Neutral (M= 4.27) and Undoing (M = 4.51) conditions.
Overall, it should be noted that while the Undoing condition
conforms to the predicted trend, it is not as markedly different
to the Neutral condition as the Predictable one.

A Changing Representation

1

The findings of these experiments illustrate that the type of
information presented in a story can lead the reader to build a
unique representation of the depicted events. This result is
supportive of the Situation Model of comprehension (Zwaan
& Radvansky, 1998), which holds that when presented with a
story, readers do not just passively absorb what is on the page
in front of them, but instead build up a rich representation of
the depicted scenario. They make assumptions about the
central characters, their goals and actions, and even form a
mental picture of the location and time in which the story is
set. This detailed representation is achieved by calling upon
the wealth of background knowledge readers have about the
world, and is highly sensitive to the way in which the
information is presented. We have also seen that, in turn, this
representation strongly determines whether subsequent events
will appear to be surprising or not, based on the degree to
which they are supported by prior events in the discourse.

Neutral and Undoing conditions (Exp. 2)
Reading times for conclusion A one-way, repeated
measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of condition for
reading times of the concluding sentence, by-participants
(F1(2,116) = 7.456; MSe = 158614.6; p<0.001), and bymaterials (F2(2,28) = 4.239; MSe = 72031.61; p <0.05). Posthoc analysis showed that the Predictable (M = 1867.08)
differed significantly from the Neutral (M= 2102.654) and the
Undoing (M = 2125.468) conditions, but the latter two
conditions were not reliably different. This result follows that
of Experiment 1, suggesting that participants only make
inferences in predictable situations.

Our results illustrate that while anything that is expected
will be judged as unsurprising, not everything unexpected
will be judged as equally surprising. We found that even
though explicit expectations were only formed in the
Predictable condition, readers in both experiments could in
fact distinguish between the various levels of predictability
depicted across the three story versions (as was evident in the
different surprise ratings). This suggests that expectation and
surprise are represented differently in the reader’s mind.
We have begun to model these effects in an extension of a
previous model of plausibility judgements (see Connell &
Keane, 2003; 2004), which creates inference paths in order to
connect the events in a discourse. The key question for our
extension of this model is how to relate the representations
that people build to the surprise ratings that they generate for
certain events. Based on the results of our experiments, it
would seem that there are two separate processes taking
place: One process occurs during reading and involves
building an up-to-date representation of the narrative
situation. This process controls the formation of forward
inferences when the discourse is highly suggestive of a
particular outcome. The other process occurs after reading,
when the reader must make a surprise judgement. Here, they
must assess their representation in order to search for any
information (i.e. enabling conditions) that is consistent with
the surprising event. By formalising these two processes, we
hope to make clear the distinction between expectation
formation and surprise in narrative.

Concluding Comments
In this paper we have outlined two novel experiments that
examine the interplay between predictability and surprise in
reading. This research highlights the fact that text
comprehension is dependent not only on our background
knowledge of the real world, but on the expectations we have
regarding story structure. People often ‘expect’ surprises
when reading, but the degree to which they do this is
mediated by the amount of information provided to them by
