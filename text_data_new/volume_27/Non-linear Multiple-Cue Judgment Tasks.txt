Cognitive models and processes

Abstract

In general, multiple cue judgments are well captured by
multiple linear regression models (Brehmer, 1994, Cooksey,
1996). These regression models are statistical descriptions
rather than process models, but implicitly this research is
often committed to the idea that people use controlled processes in working memory to mentally integrate cues according to a linear additive rule. In contrast, exemplar models
assume that people make judgments by retrieving similar
stored exemplars from memory (Medin & Schaffer, 1978;
Nosofsky & Johansen, 2000). The exemplar representations
in memory are the holistic concrete experienced instances
often emphasized in categorization.
The generalized judgment model Σ implicates a sequential
adjustment process, compatible both with a linear, additive
cue-integration rule, and the additive combination of exemplars in exemplar models (Juslin et al., 2004), capturing the
additive character of a judgment. By considering the structural properties of a task environment, we are able to predict
representational shifts in the process that support multiple
cue judgment. In additive environments cue abstraction
dominate, while exemplar memory dominates in multiplicative environments (Juslin et al., 2004).
In the Σ model the previous estimate is adjusted every time
a new piece of evidence is presented. If no new evidence is
presented cues correspond to an a priori estimate. In Σ, cue
abstraction involves sequential adjustment based on single
cues, where the cue weight is relative to the cues presented so
far. In contrast, the weight assigned to an exemplar is given
by its similarity relative to the similarity to all exemplars
retrieved so far. Because of the integration of stored criterion
values instead of cue-criterion relations, Σ is not confined to
any particular task structure. Therefore, the model can represent any task structure as long as similar exemplars have
similar criteria, which allows judgments also in non-linear
and multiplicative environments (Juslin et al., 2004).

In two experiments we examined which cognitive processes people use in a non-linear multiple cue judgment task,
proposing that people are not able to use explicit cue abstraction when judging objects with a non-linear structure
between the cues of the objects and the criterion and therefore they are forced to use exemplar-based processes. Consistent with the results reveal strong exemplar effects in the
non-linear condition.

Introduction
How do we judge if there seems to be no underlying structure
or pattern in the things or events we have to judge? What
knowledge representations do we use in these situations? Our
ability to categorize the environment is important to us and
different environmental categorization situations involve
different processes, either in the form of analytic or intuitive
thought. Multiple cue judgment tasks typically involve a
probe defined by a number of binary or continuous cues and
require a continuous judgment. Previous research suggests
that by manipulating the task environment we can induce a
shift between distinct cognitive processes (Juslin, Olsson, &
Olsson, 2003). Two cognitive models of general concern in
cognitive science, are the explicit, rule-based and analytic
knowledge versus implicit, silent knowledge based on personal experience (Hahn & Chater, 1998; Hammond, 1996;
Sloman, 1996; E. E. Smith, Patalano, & Jonides, 1998). Research on multiple cue judgment has primarily stressed controlled integration of cues that have been abstracted in training (Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979) while exemplar models are emphasized by research on categorization
(Nosofsky & Johansen, 2000; Nosofsky & Palmeri, 1997). In
this article we address the following question: what structure
of a categorization task triggers analytic thinking and what
structure triggers intuition? We hypothesize that participants
are not able to use cue abstraction in a non-linear task, because the mind is constrained to linear additive integration of
abstracted cue-criterion relations (Juslin, Karlsson, & Olsson,
2004).

Judgment task and Model Predictions
The participants used four binary cues to infer a continuous
criterion in either a linear or a non-linear multiple-cue judgment task. The exotic (but fictitious) Death bug is the cover
story in the task that involves judgments of the toxicity of

from an additive linear function to be a multiplicative nonlinear one. When a participant can not use a simple additive
rule to calculate what correct criterion is in a judgment. The
non-linear function can also be plotted against the criterion
values for the non-linear function on the x-axis (Figure 2),
where the function only has six criterion values and two or
four examples matching each criterion (see Table 1).

subspecies of the bug, which can be inferred from four cues
of the subspecies (leg length, nose length, spots or no spots
on the fore back and different patterns on the buttock). The
concentration of poison varies from 50 to 60 ppm in each
subspecies (Jones et al., 2000; Juslin et al., 2003; Juslin et al.,
2004). The task structure is summarized in Table 1.

The values of the binary cues take on 1 or 0. The function of
the cue values to judge the toxicity cL of a subspecies is linear
and additive in the linear judgment task:

A quadratic function of the criteria in the linear condition
was made as the function in the non-linear judgment task
with the same range (50 to 60 ppm) and maximum value (60
ppm) with a non-linear relationship between the cues and the
criterion instead of the linear function.

c NL = − 2 ⋅ c L ²/5 + 44 ⋅ c L − 1150

Cognitive Models
Cue abstraction model. The application of the cue abstraction model to continuous criteria implies that participants abstract cue weights ω i , which specify the importance
and the sign of the relation of the cue (i=1…4). In training
participants abstract the cue weights and use those to compute an estimate of the criterion when a new probe is presented. The estimate of c is adjusted according to the cue
weight and the final estimate ĉ R of c is a linear additive
function of the cue values Ci. For example, after training the
rule for cue C1 may specify that C1 goes with a large increase
in toxicity. This corresponds to the standard application of a
linear additive equation to model multiple cue judgment,

The functions c is the level of poison in the bug and C1…C4
are weighted binary features of the bug. For example a bug
with features [1101] has a toxicity level of 58 in the linear
condition and a toxicity level of 56.4 in the non-linear condition, see Table 1. The criterion c is computed by assigning
the most important cue, C1, and has the largest weight with
the least important cue that has the smallest weight, C4. If the
binary cue has value 1, it suggests high toxicity level, and if
the cue has value 0, it suggests low toxicity level, see Table
1. In Experiment 1 a normally and independently random
error was added. The variance of the random error would
produce a .9 correlation (see Juslin et al, 2003). Figure 1
illustrates the relationship between the two functions in a
plotted diagram. The non-linear function is a more complex
environment than the linear function. The increase of complexity in a function or environment is when a function goes

Eq. 5 is the context model (Medin & Schaffer, 1978) applied to a continuum (see Delosh et al., 1997; Juslin & Persson, 2000; E. R. Smith & Zarate, 1992). The application of
an exemplar model to multiple-cue judgment is illustrated in
Figure 3. The similarity between probe p and exemplar xj is
computed according to the multiplicative similarity rule of
the original context model (Medin & Schaffer, 1978):

where di is an index that takes value 1 if the cue values on
cue dimension i coincide (i.e., both are 0 or both are 1), and si
if they deviate (i.e., one is 0, the other is 1). si are four
parameters in the interval [0, 1] that capture the impact of
deviating cues values (features) on the overall perceived
similarity S(p,xj). si close to1 implies that a deviating feature
on this cue dimension has no impact on the perceived
similarity and is considered irrelevant. si close to 0 means
that the similarity S(p,xj) is close to 0 if this feature is
deviating, thus assigning crucial importance to the feature.
The parameters si capture the similarity relations between
stimuli and the attention paid to each cue dimension, where a
low si signifies high attention. In effect, for low si, only
identical exemplars have a profound effect on the judgments.
For example, with all si=.001 identical exemplars receive
weight 1 in Eq. 4, but exemplars with just one deviating
feature receive weight .001. With si close to 1, on the other
hand, all exemplars receive the same weight, regardless of
the number of deviating features.

The discrimination of the models involves the existence or no
existence of extrapolation and interpolation, in other words,
the ability to make accurate judgments of new exemplars.
When a constrained set of subspecies are omitted in training
phase (two extreme exemplars, e.g. [1 1 1 1] and [0 0 0 0]
and three middle exemplars, [1 0 1 1], [10 1 0], [1 0 0 1], see
Table 1 for new N, and old, O exemplars) and the
participants are presented with the complete set of subspecies
in the test phase, the cue abstraction model affords
extrapolation and interpolation, because the model allows the
adding function of integrated cue values that produce
accurate judgments. The participants will figure out that the
extreme subspecies with all cues presented and all cues
absent should have the most extreme value, even if they have
never been presented to these subspecies in the training
phase, also no old-new differences between the intermediate
exemplars omitted in training should exist in the cue
abstraction model. In contrast, the exemplar model is not able
to extrapolate or interpolate, when the responses for the new
exemplars are determined by retrieval of identical exemplars
(Delosh et al., 1997; Erickson & Kruschke, 1998). Because
the exemplar model involves linear combination of the
criteria observed in training that range between the toxicity
levels 51 and 59, it can never produce a judgment outside this
range, as extrapolation requires. The exemplar model also
predicts old-new differences with more accurate judgments
for old exemplars than for new when the toxicity level can be
retrieved from memory (Juslin et al., 2003).

Predictions by the Models
Predictions by the cue abstraction and exemplar model
are summarized in Figure 3. When participants are trained
with all 16 exemplars it is impossible to discriminate the
different models from each other, because they predict the
same accurate judgments (see Figure 3, panel A and B). This
perfect accuracy depends on correct knowledge of the cue
weights and error-free integration of this knowledge into a
judgment in the cue abstraction model while it derives from
retrieval of stored exemplars, where only identical exemplars
are allowed to have a strong effect on the judgment in the
exemplar model.

We expected the determinism and the exemplarmemorization request to increase the performance and the
use of exemplar memory.

Method
Participants
Fifty-four undergraduate students from the university participated in the two experiments (thirty participants in Experiment 1 and twenty-four participants in Experiment 2).
Twenty-three males and twenty-seven females. The average
age was 24.25 years. Each participant received 70 SEK (approximately 8$) in payment for participation in the study.

Dependent Measures
The dependent measures reported involve: performance, the
representation index, and model fit. The performance measures are, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of judgments
(between judgment and criteria), and consistency (correlation
between the two judgments made for the same exemplar in
the test phase).
A Representation index (RI) was calculated to see what
level of representation that dominates the judgments in the
two different tasks. The interpolation measure is obtained by
taking the difference between absolute deviation between
judgment and criteria for old exemplars and new exemplars
as computed by the following formula,
I = ∑ [d(Old)n – d(New)n ]/6
(6)
Where n is refers to criterion 55, 56 and 57 in the linear condition and criterion 58.4, 59.6 and 60 in the non-linear condition denoted either as “Training(Old)” or “Interp.(New)” in
Table 1. The exemplars in the extrapolation are also considered. Extrapolation is measured by the deviation from an
expected linear extrapolation, based on mean judgment of the
old exemplars in the interpolation range. The difference
between actual judgment and expected value is the extrapolation measure. A 0 in the extrapolation index implies that the
judgements for the extreme exemplars are as extreme as the
expected regression-based extrapolation for the old exemplars, and the judgments are correct by all linear transformations of the correct judgments. This suggests appropriate
extrapolation. When extreme exemplars do not receive as
extreme judgments as expected from extrapolation and the
index is negative. This in turn, supports the exemplar model
and its inability to extrapolate. In other words, the exemplar
model does not allow accurate extrapolation while cue abstraction does (see Figure1, for a concrete illustration).
To increase the statistical power in the analysis of the
data and for ease of exposition of the data the interpolation
index and extrapolation index are combined which gives us
the RI. The RI indicates if participants have based their
judgments on exemplar model or cue abstraction. A RI of 0
implies the regression-based paradox with the ability to extrapolate while a negative index implies the inability to extrapolate, exactly the same as mentioned before, in the extrapolation index.
By using the data from the training phase in each task to
create predictions of the two models was performed in a
computer simulation. The Model fit measures are the coefficient of determination (r2) and Root Mean Square Deviation
(RMSD) between predictions and the computed test phase
data.

Design and procedure
The design of the two experiments was a between-subjects
design, where all participants made the judgments in training
and test with same stimuli presentation format. Each experiment contained two conditions each. In Experiment 1, a
probabilistic linear judgment task condition and a probabilistic non-linear judgment task condition
The written instructions informed the participants that
there were different subspecies of a Death Bug and that the
task was to estimate the toxicity (poison level) of the subspecies as a number between 50 and 60. The experiments
contained two phases, where the first phase was a training
phase which provided trial-by-trial outcome feedback about
the continuous criterion (“This bug has toxicity 56.7%”). In
the training phase 11 training exemplars of the bug were
presented 20 times each, a total of 220 trials with criterion
values between 51 and 59 in the linear condition and between
53.6 and 60 in the non-linear condition. The remaining five
exemplars were omitted in the training phase and first presented in the test phase. Participants were trained and tested
with analogue stimuli in the form of pictures of the bug species, presented on the computer screen.
The subspecies varied with regard in four binary cues; leg
length (short or long), nose length (short or long), spots or no
spots on the fore back and two different patterns on the buttock and different colors were used for the cue values to
strengthen their salience. The abstract cues in Table 1 were
randomly assigned to new visual features for each participant. The cue values had the weights 4, 3, 2 and 1 which
determine the portion of toxicity that each cue adds to the
total amount. The question asked on the computer screen was
“What is the toxicity of this subspecies”.
In the test phase, all 16 exemplars were presented, including the five exemplars omitted in the training phase. The test
phase went over 32 trials, where the 16 exemplars were presented twice in a random order. The participants made same
judgments as in the training phase but received no outcome
feedback. The whole experiment took 45 minutes.
Experiment 2 involved the same stimuli and non-linear
structure as Experiment 1. However, in contrast to Experiment 1, the cue criterion-relation was changed from a probabilistic task to a deterministic task. The length of the training phase was also changed from 220 trials to 440 trials. The
instructions were the same in the first condition (Oldinstructions condition) as in Experiment 1 but was changed
in the second condition (New instructions condition), and
encourage the participants to memorize each bug exemplar.

nearly the same (.17 for the regular instruction condition and

a lower value for the exemplar instruction condition (1.93) than
the regular instruction condition (2.50), with significant
difference (F(1.10)=9.28; p=0.002; MSE=6.70). In Figure 6 the
mean test judgment from the regular instruction condition and
the exemplar instruction condition are plotted against the

Representation. The linear judgment task has a lower RI
value (-0.67) than the non-linear judgment task (-1.33), but
not significant different (F(1, 28)=0.79; p=0.38; MSE=4.08).
The RI in the non-linear condition is significantly separated
from zero but not in the linear condition. This suggests that
EBM is the model in use in the non-linear condition, while
both CAM and EBM is in use in the linear condition.
Model fit. The models in Eq. 3 and 4 were fitted to the
mean judgments computed for the constrained training set
with 11 subspecies of the bug across the last 110 trials. Cue
abstraction model allows analytic derivation of the bestfitting parameters that corresponds to logistic regression. By
the Quasi-Newton method in the MathCAD software the
parameters for the exemplar model with the minimal squared
sum of error were obtained.
The model fits (see Figure 5) show that in the
probabilistic additive linear condition both EBM and CAM
have high correlation indices and about the same RMSD
values (EBM; r2= .92 and RMSD=0.55 and CAM; r2= .96
and RMSD= 0.54). In the non linear condition EBM and
CAM presents approximately the same RMSD (EBM;
RMSD= 0.51 and CAM; RMSD = 0.59) as in the linear
condition, while the correlation is very low (EBM; r2= .49
and CAM; r2= .24), with some advantage for EBM.
When looking at the training data we see that the curve of
learning was very flat, which imply that the participants may
not have learned to asymptote in the training phase. This
could has effected the results and therefore Experiment 2 was
constructed to provide a better setting for testing the
hypothesis that participants are not able to use cue abstraction
in a non-linear task.

Representation.The RI shows that the regular instruction
condition has a higher RI value (-2.68) than the exemplar
instruction condition (-2.79), but the difference is not
significant (F(1.10)=0.30; p=0.86; MSE=2.40). The RI is
separated from zero which suggests that EBM is used in both
conditions.
Model fit. The same procedure for model fit was used as in
Experiment 1. The model fits (see Figure 6) show that EBM
has high correlation in both regular instruction condition
(EBM; r2=.68 and RMSD=1.03) and exemplar instruction
condition (EBM; r2=.87 and RMSD=0.7) compared to CAM
in the conditions (regular instruction condition, CAM; r2=.46
and RMSD=1.09 and exemplar instruction condition; CAM;
r2=.39 and RMSD=1.27) which suggests a dominated use of
EBM in both condition, but strongest in the exemplar
instruction condition.

Discussion
The question addressed in this article is what structure of
a categorization task triggers analytic thinking and what
structure triggers intuition? We hypothesized that participants
are not able to use the cue abstraction model, because it is too
difficult to induce the equation that underlies the criterion.
Overall, the results in Experiment 1 the non-linear condition
shows little fit to the rule-based model CAM. The higher RI,
the poor results on old and new exemplars in the interpolation and extrapolation range, all support EBM. The results of
the RMSD that is almost identical to the linear condition can
not suggest which model that is used, if any of the models
was. One possible explanation of the low RMSD and the
poor consistency correlation is that the judgment curve has a
flack inclination, and the task is thus to complex to learn.
Because of the lack of learning for the participants in Experiment 1, we investigated in Experiment 2 if longer training phase and a change from a probabilistic to a deterministic
non-linear task could allow the participants to use any of the
processes. The results clearly showed the use of EBM in both
conditions suggesting that determinism and more training
make it possible to adopt exemplar-based process and use it
more effectively. The use of cue abstraction seems to be nonexistent in the experiments which support the hypotheses that
the non-linear judgment task is too complex for judgments
based on mental integrated cues and the idea that exemplarbased processes will serve as a back-up system when cue
abstraction is impossible.
