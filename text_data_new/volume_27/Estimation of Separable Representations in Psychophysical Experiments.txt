The Experiment

It is sensible to suppose that, at least because of discretization errors, the relation holds approximately, that
is we can write:

The experiment was conducted on 69 Italian students
(from 1st to 4th university year in Economics). The
language of the experiment was Italian. The experiment
was made on personal computers with 3 rounds of 23
subjects each. Each round lasted 1h30min and subjects
had the possibility of using pocket calculators and sheets
of papers if they wanted to. The first 30 minutes were
dedicated to reading together the written instructions
that each subject received when entering the computer
room and answering subjects’ questions.
Subjects were asked to rate on a 1-9 integer scale the
values of ratios of known probabilities, ratios of distances
of pairs of Italian cities from a reference point and ratios
of rainfalls in pairs of European cities; the ratios of the
real stimuli were choosen to lie within the stated range
1-9. We chose not to randomize the order in which the
three sub-experiments were to be performed. We namely
decided to assign deterministically each of the 6 possible
orders so that we knew from the start that none of the
subjects’ direct neighbors would work on the same subexperiment at the same time.
It was decided to use a monetary reward as an incentive for subjects to perform the experiment as well as
possible. Subjects were explained at the beginning of
the experiment how the payment would be calculated.
Namely, payment was proportional to good performance
in the experiment.
Since in the following we will consider only the subexperiment concerning distances, we will discuss this one
in greater detail. We presented to the subjects 10 pairs
of Italian cities and we asked them to estimate the ratio
of their distances with respect to Milan: the 10 pairs
are given by all the possible combinations out of the five
cities Turin, Venice, Rome, Naples and Palermo. The
range of the stimuli goes from 124 to 885 km and the
range of the real distance ratios from 2 to 7.137.

π = w−1 [Ψ (δ1 ) − Ψ (δ2 )] + ε,

where ε is an error term. Remark that this is a special
case of a much more general specification, in which the
dependence of π on δ1 and δ2 is left unrestricted:
π = f (δ1 , δ2 ) + ε.

When ρ or ρ0 is equal to 1, this reduces to a power law.
The statistical test of these functional forms is left to
further work.

Structure of the Data
Now we describe the structure of the data provided
by the experiment. For any individual h = 1, . . . , H
with H = 69, we observe a vector of log-ratios π h =
¢
¡ h
h T
where C = 10 is the number of possible
π 1 , . . . , πC
pairwise comparisons. For any stated log-ratio πih (which
corresponds to the i−th comparison for the h−th individual), we know also the values of the lograrithms of
stimuli, say δi,1 = log (di,1 ) and δi,2 = log (di,2 ); remark
that the stimuli do not depend on the individual h. We
suppose the existence of a relation of the form

Log-log Transformation
The main problem with representation (1) is that it is not
directly amenable to statistical estimation. Therefore, in
order to get a simpler formulation, we write it as follows:

πih = f (δi,1 , δi,2 ) + εhi .

ln W [exp (ln p)] = ln ψ [exp (ln d1 )] − ln ψ [exp (ln d2 )] .

The case of interest is the one in which the function f
takes the form (3), but we will also consider below a more
general framework in which f is left unrestricted: this
will allow us to test the restriction through statistical
techniques. The residuals
for¢ the individual h are stacked
¡
in a vector εh = εh1 , . . . , εhC : we suppose that ¡the¢mean
and the¡ covariance
matrix are respectively E εh = 0
¢
h
and V ε = Σ. The matrix Σ can take several alternative forms, but we will not pursue the topic here.
Details are available from the authors upon request.

This is equivalent to a log-log transformation (see Luce,
2002, p. 526). We define:
π = ln p
δi = ln di
ln W [exp (·)] = w (·)
ln ψ [exp (·)] = Ψ (·) ;
the constraints W (1) = 1 and ψ (1) = 1 become respectively w (0) = 0 and Ψ (0) = 0. This means that we can
write the separable representation (1) as:
π

(4)

We will call SEP (for separable) the model of equation
(3) and UNR (for unrestricted ) the model of equation
(4).
Even though the model of Equation (3) is restricted, it
is general enough to recover the main theoretical models
that can be found in the literature. Indeed, Stevens’
model is obtained simply by putting Ψ (δ) = κδ and
w (π) = π (or alternatively Ψ (δ) = δ and w (π) = πκ ).
Model of Equation (2) proposed in Luce (2001b) and
Prelec (1998) becomes, in our logarithmic formulation:

Statistical Theory
Our aim is to estimate functions w (·) and Ψ (·) using
statistical methods. Different theories assume different
forms for these functions. In a first time, we would like

Ψ (δ1 ) − Ψ (δ2 )

= w−1 [Ψ (δ1 ) − Ψ (δ2 )] .

to compare the unrestricted model of Equation (4) and
the restricted model of Equation (3) to statistically test
whether there is enough empirical evidence that supports
the restricted model. Should it be the case, we would like
in a second time to compare the restricted model to its
further particulars, namely the models of Stevens and
the one of Luce and Prelec.
The key idea to perform a rigorous statistical analysis
of the problem is to use nonparametric methods. We
assume namely that the functions f (·), w−1 (·) and Ψ (·)
are smooth enough to be approximated by a polynomial
expansion. (Remark that this requirement is not very
constraining since all the proposed theorical models so
far suppose infinitely smooth functions.)
Let M , L and N be the respective orders of the polynomials used to approximate f (·), w−1 (·) and Ψ (·) respectively. Remark that f (·) is a function of two arguments δ1 and δ2 ; the polynomials that approximate it
must therefore contains all the powers of δ1 and δ2 up
to order M . Remark also that the function of interest is
w (·), so that the approximation of w−1 (·) must be inverted to get the the approximation of w (·). It is easy to
see that the assumption W (1) = 1 (which is always assumed) implies that these polynomials have no constant
term.
Summing up, for the UNR model the parameters to
+2)
be estimated are Σ and the (M +1)(M
polynomial pa2
rameters, while for the SEP model the parameters are
Σ, and the L + N − 1 polynomial parameters. Stevens’
model is a restriction of SEP in which N = L = 1.
Supposing that the errors ε are distributed according
to a multivariate normal distribution, we can write the
loglikelihood and maximize it numerically in order to get
the maximum likelihood estimates. The UNR model is
quite simple to estimate, while the SEP model is very
complex and requires a particular algorithm derived by
the authors at this aim. More details are available upon
request.
The main problem is to select the number of terms in
the polynomial regressions (N , L and M ). In order to
do so, we use the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion;
see Schwarz, 1978), a method to penalize the likelihood
taking into account the number of parameters. In the
UNR model we just have to choose M , while in the SEP
model we have to choose both N and L. Our strategy
for the present case is to estimate several polynomial regression models for different values of M and (N, L), to
choose the best UNR and SEP models according to the
BIC and to test the restrictions imposed by the separable
representation of equation (1), either through the BIC or
through likelihood ratio tests. Once the model has been
choosen, we can get the following estimates of the functions some algebra gives the nonparametric estimates of
ψ and W .

the UNR type and the best model of the SEP type
shows that the SEP model appears to have a slight advantage over the UNR one. This suggests that a separable representation is supported by our experiment.
As we remarked above, the Stevens’ model arises when
(N, L) = (1, 1); since the values of N and L that appear as best are both different from 1, we cannot provide
support for the Stevens’ power-law model. This finding
is confirmed by the BIC value (that is −0.6566 for the
model in (3) and −0.7926 for Stevens’ model) and by a
likelihood ratio test (that takes the value 207.357 with 3
degrees of freedom, that is a p−value of 1.1 · 10−44 ).
Now we come to a deeper analysis of SEP, UNR and
Stevens’ models. Using the estimated parameters of the
model with (N, L) = (2, 3), it is possible to get an estimate of the functions ψ and W . Figures 1 and 2 show respectively the subjective weighting function and the psychophysical function for the SEP model (solid line) and
Stevens’ model (dashed line). The functions have been
rescaled in order to have the same origin and the same
slope at the origin, but the different behavior of the functions is evident. Figure 3 displays a three-dimensional
representation of the expected
³
´value of p as stated by
ψ(d1 )
an individual (i.e. W −1 ψ(d
for d1 and d2 varying
2)
in the range of the data) and Figure 4 shows the same
graph from above: the contour lines represent equal integer values of p. The deviation from the true value of
the ratio (i.e. dd12 ) is difficult to see. Therefore, in Figure
5 we have displayed a three-dimensional representation
of the deviation³of the´expected value of p from the true
d1
1)
one (i.e. W −1 ψ(d
ψ(d2 ) − d2 ); Figure 6 shows the same
graph from above, with contour lines separated by 0.5
units.
Also Stevens’ model has been estimated. The parameter value is φ1 = 0.835 and this corresponds to
³ ´0.835
(this has to be comψ (d) = d0.835 and p = dd12
pared with the estimated exponents in Stevens, 1961).
Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10 show the expected value of p and
its deviation from the true value: the graphs are quite
far from the corresponding ones for the SEP model.

The Results
Comparing the estimated models according to the BIC,
it turns out that the best model of class UNR arises
for M = 2, while the best model of class SEP for
(N, L) = (2, 3). The comparison of the best model of

At last, we show the same graphs (see Figures 11, 12,

that the similarity with the corresponding SEP model is
much stronger.
