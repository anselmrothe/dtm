Abstract
We present two magnitude estimation experiments on the role
of resumptive pronouns in subject extraction in English and
German. In the theoretical literature, resumptives have been
claimed to remedy effects of island violations, but our results
show that this is not the case. Furthermore, our data also confirm the existence of a that-trace effect for both languages, contrary to theoretical claims that this effect is not present in German. On a methodological level, our study demonstrates the
importance of controlled experiments for obtaining theoretically crucial linguistic judgments, and the potential of the magnitude estimation paradigm for crosslinguistic comparisons.
Keywords: grammaticality judgments; magnitude estimation;
resumptive pronouns; island constraints; crosslinguistic experiments.

Introduction
Linguistic Intuitions The data on which linguists base
their theories typically consist of grammaticality judgments,
i.e., intuitive judgments of the well-formedness of utterances
in a given language. When a linguist obtains a grammaticality judgment, he or she performs a small experiment on a
native speaker; the resulting data are behavioral data in the
same way as other measurements of linguistic performance
(e.g., the reaction time data used in psycholinguistics). However, in contrast to experimental psychologists, linguists are
generally not concerned with methodological issues, and typically none of the standard experimental controls are imposed
in collecting data for linguistic theory. Such methodological
negligence can seriously compromise the data obtained as
demonstrated by Schütze (1996), who argues for a more reliable mode of data elicitation in linguistics, based on standard
methods from experimental psychology.
Bard et al. (1996) and Cowart (1997) demonstrated how the
experimental paradigm of magnitude estimation (ME) makes
it possible to address problems such as the ones raised by
Schütze. ME is an experimental technique standardly used
in psychophysics to measure judgments of sensory stimuli
(Stevens, 1975). It requires subjects to estimate the magnitude of physical stimuli by assigning numerical values proportional to the stimulus magnitude they perceive. Highly
stable judgments can be achieved for a whole range of sensory modalities, such as brightness, loudness, or tactile stimulation. Bard et al. (1996) demonstrated that linguistic judgments can be elicited in the same way as judgments of sensory stimuli, and that ME can yield reliable and fine-grained
measurements of linguistic intuitions. ME has since been applied successfully to a range of linguistic phenomena, includ-

ing binding (Featherston, 2002), superiority (Meyer, 2003),
and word order (Keller & Alexopoulou, 2001).
The present paper applies the ME methodology to a longstanding dispute in linguistic theory, viz., the status of resumptive pronouns in extraction. While this is a topic of considerable interest in the literature, progress is hampered by
disagreement on both the relevant data and on the theoretical conclusions to be drawn from these data. We address this
problem by presenting two ME experiments that shed light
on the status of resumptive pronouns in subject extraction in
English and German. By running experiments on the same
linguistic construction in two languages, we also introduce a
methodological innovation: most previous ME studies were
only concerned with data for a single language, thus missing
out on crosslinguistic generalizations, which are crucial for
modern linguistic theory.
Islands and Resumption in Object Extractions Ever
since Ross (1967), island constraints have been a major focus
of research in syntactic theory. Islands are syntactic environments that do not allow extraction, i.e., an element that occurs within the island can not be dislocated by wh-extraction
in order to form, e.g., a question or relative clause. (1) gives a
number of standard examples: (1-a) is a case of an extraction
from a subordinate clause, which is acceptable, as subordinate clauses are not islands for extraction (note the use of t
to indicate the gap, i.e., the site from which the extraction
took place). (1-b) is an extraction from an indirect question
(whether-clause). This extraction is of intermediate acceptability; indirect questions are referred to as weak islands.
Finally, (1-c) illustrates extraction out of a relative clauses,
which is severely unacceptable: relative clauses are strong
islands for extraction.
(1) a. Who does John think Mary will choose t?
b. ?*Who did Mary wonder whether they will fire t?
c. *Who did John meet the girl who will marry t?
Island constraints are known to interact with resumptive pronouns, i.e., pronouns that function as an overt realization of
the gap t left behind by extraction. In particular, Ross (1967)
and Sells (1984) claim that the presence of a resumptive pronoun can “save” island violations. The expectation then is that
the sentences with resumptives in (2) should be more acceptable than the corresponding sentences with gaps in (1).

Who did Mary wonder whether they will fire him?
Who did John meet the girl who will marry him?

However, a recent magnitude estimation study of the interaction between resumption and islands in extraction from
object questions has only partially confirmed this picture
(Alexopoulou & Keller, 2003). Weak islands were indeed
found to incur a significant drop in acceptability for examples like (1-b), which were in turn significantly more acceptable than examples like (1-c). But interestingly, embedding
per se was also found to reduce acceptability (in particular for
double embedded gaps like who did John think Peter claimed
Mary would choose?). Furthermore, contrary to claims in the
literature, resumption was not found to “save” island violations: resumptives were at most as acceptable as gaps. However, the acceptability of resumptives did improve when they
were embedded in a that- or whether-clause, indicating that
resumption reverses the effect of weak islands and embedding
on questions (though it cannot restore them to full acceptability). The present study extends this investigation to subject
questions and further explores the nature of the embedding
effect by comparing questions with declaratives.
Subject Questions Subject questions differ from object
questions in English in a crucial way: they are ungrammatical
(see (3-b)), unless the complementizer is absent (see (3-c)).
The phenomenon is standardly referred to as the that-trace
effect (Beletti & Rizzi, 1988).
(3) a. Who do you think that Mary will invite t?
b. *Who do you think that t will invite Mary?
c. Who do you think t will invite Mary?
Crosslinguistically, authors like Lutz (1996) have claimed
that, unlike English, no that-trace effects are present in German, as indicated by the grammaticality of (4) (ibid., p. 36).

has
In this paper, we present two magnitude estimation studies
investigating the interaction between islands and subject extractions. We compare the status of that-trace violations with
that of strong and weak island violations in English and German. We further explore the interaction between islands and
resumption which, as in the case of object extractions, has
been argued to remedy that-trace violations, as in the following examples ((5) is from Sells (1984), and (6) from McDaniel & Cowart (1999)):
(5) Which woman does no Englishman even wonder
whether she will make a good wife?
(6) That’s the girl that I wonder whether she met you.
Finally, we compare the effect of embedding in questions and
in declaratives, in order to establish whether embedding affects long distance dependencies only.

Experiment 1: Resumptives and Subject
Extraction in English
This experiment investigated four different types of islands:
complement clause without that (no island), complement
clause with that (no island), complement clause with whether
(weak island), relative clause (strong island). Two levels of

embedding were tested: single embedding (one complement
clause or relative clause) and double embedding (one complement clause embedding another complement clause or a
relative clause). To have a standard of comparison, we also included sentences without embedding (control condition, zero
embedding). Example sentences are given below.
(7) No island violation (bare clause)
a. Who will t/he fire Sue? (zero embedding)
b. Who does Mary claim t/he will fire Sue? (single)
c. Who does Jane think Mary claims t/he will fire
Sue? (double)
(8) No island violation (that-clause)
a. Who does Mary claim that t/he will fire Sue? (single)
b. Who does Jane think that Mary claims that t/he will
fire Sue? (double)
(9) Weak island violation (whether-clause)
a. Who does Mary wonder whether t/he will fire Sue?
(single)
b. Who does Jane think that Mary wonders whether
t/he will fire Sue? (double)
(10) Strong island violation (relative clause)
a. Who does Mary meet the people that t/he will
fire? (single)
b. Who does Jane think that Mary meets the people
that t/he will fire? (double)
In addition to the wh-extraction conditions, a declarative control condition was included: each question item was matched
by the corresponding declarative; example (11) gives the
declaratives corresponding to the questions in (7).
(11) Declarative (bare clause)
a. Mary will fire Sue. (zero embedding)
b. Jane claims Mary will fire Sue. (single)
c. Rachel thinks Jane claims Mary will fire Sue.
(double)
Method Forty-four subjects were recruited over the Internet by postings to newsgroups and mailing lists. All subjects
were self-reported native speakers of English. Linguists and
students of linguistics were excluded from the sample.
The design crossed the following factors: E MBEDDING
(single or double), I SLAND (complement clause without
that, complement clause with that, complement clause with
whether, relative clause), and R ESUMPTION (gap, resumptive, declarative). This resulted in E MBEDDING × I SLAND ×
R ESUMPTION = 2 × 4 × 3 = 24 cells. As controls, we included stimuli without embedding (gap, resumptive, declarative), increasing the number of cells to 27. Nine lexicalizations were used for each cell, yielding a total of 243 stimuli.
The stimulus set was divided into nine subsets of 27 stimuli
by placing the items in a Latin square. A set of 30 fillers was
used, covering the whole acceptability range.
The method used was ME as proposed by Stevens (1975)
for psychophysics and extended to linguistic stimuli by Bard
et al. (1996) and Cowart (1997). Subjects first saw a set of in-

A post-hoc Tukey test was conducted to further investigate
the interaction of I SLAND and R ESUMPTION. Its results are
tabulated in Table 1. We also carried out a series of Dunnett
tests to compare the single and double embedding conditions
with unembedded controls; see Table 2.
Discussion We found a significant interaction of resumption and embedding in this experiment, which demonstrates
that the various types of islands tested show differential behavior with respect to subject extraction. A post-hoc test detected the locus of this effect: for bare subordinate clauses,
questions with gaps are as acceptable as declaratives, while
questions with resumptives are significantly less acceptable.
In the other three island conditions (that-clause, whetherclause, relative clause), the opposite pattern was found: gaps
and resumptives were equally unacceptable, and both were
significantly less acceptable than declaratives (see Table 1).
This finding provides evidence for the that-trace effect, in
line with the theoretical literature: subject extraction out of
bare complement clauses is acceptable (i.e., as acceptable
as declaratives), while subject extraction out of that-clauses
is unacceptable (i.e., less acceptable than declaratives), see
Cowart (1997) for similar results on that-trace effects in English. Furthermore, our results show that whether-clauses and
relative clauses behave like that-clauses in this construction.
Regarding the effect of embedding, the following pattern
emerged: for gapped clauses, the single and double embedding conditions were significantly less acceptable than the
unembedded control condition. This pattern was consistent
across all types of islands. In the resumptive condition, however, there was no difference between the single and double
embedded condition and the unembedded control; again this
pattern was the same across all types of islands (see Table 2).
Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that there
is no effect of resumption for subject extraction: resumptives
are never able to compensate for the effect of embedding, i.e.,
they are equally bad in embedded and unembedded conditions. Moreover, gaps were as bad as resumptives in all island conditions (with the exception of the bare complement
clause, where we found the that-trace effect). Note in particular that this means that there is no difference between subject
extraction out of that-, whether-, and relative clauses; these
constructions all behave like strong islands, in the sense that
extraction is as bad as an unembedded resumptive. This contrasts sharply with object extractions, where this pattern was
found only for relative clauses (Alexopoulou & Keller, 2003).
Moreover, this contrasts also with the results of McDaniel &
Cowart (1999) who investigated relative clauses instead of
questions and found that resumption can remedy that-trace
violations for relativization, as illustrated by the following
pattern:

structions that explained the concept of numerical ME using
line length. Subjects were instructed to make length estimates
relative to the first line they would see, the reference line.
They were told to give the reference line an arbitrary number, and then assign a number to each following line so that it
represented how long the line was in proportion to the reference line. Several example lines and corresponding numerical
estimates were provided to illustrate the concept of proportionality. Then subjects were told that linguistic acceptability
could be judged in the same way as line length, i.e., by comparing the acceptability of a target sentence to that of a reference sentence. The task was illustrated by examples. The experiment was conducted over the web using WebExp (Keller
et al., 1998), an interactive software package for web-based
psycholinguistic experimentation.
Results The data were normalized by dividing each numeric judgment by the value that the subject had assigned
to the reference sentence. This operation creates a common
scale for all subjects. Then the data were transformed by taking the decadic logarithm. This transformation ensures that
the judgments are normally distributed and is standard practice for ME data (Bard et al., 1996). All analyses and figures
are based on normalized, log-transformed judgments. Figure 1 graphs the mean judgments for all four island conditions.
An A NOVA yielded significant main effects of E MBED DING (F1 (1, 43) = 17.482, p < .0005; F2 (1, 8) = 14.525, p =
.005), I SLAND (F1 (3, 129) = 25.577, p < .0005; F2 (3, 24) =
9.055, p < .0005), and R ESUMPTION (F1 (2, 86) = 57.742,
p < .0005; F2 (2, 16) = 213.4149, p < .0005). The interactions I SLAND/R ESUMPTION (F1 (6, 258) = 15.552,
p < .0005; F2 (6, 48) = 3.908, p = .003) and E M BEDDING /R ESUMPTION (F1 (2, 86) = 12.933, p < .0005;
F2 (2, 16) = 6.299, p = .010) were significant, while the I S LAND /E MBEDDING interaction was only significant by subjects (F1 (3, 129) = 4.827, p = .003; F2 (3, 24) = 1.377, p =
.274), and the I SLAND/E MBEDDING/R ESUMPTION failed to
reach significance.

Finally, the results in the declarative control condition are
surprising: we demonstrated that there is a penalty for embedding even for declaratives: double embedding is less acceptable than single embedding for all types of embedding;
however, single embedding is not less acceptable than no embedding, with the exception of the relative clause condition.

Extraction in German

(13) a.

This experiment replicated the results of Experiment 1 for
German. As outlined in the introduction, there are welldocumented differences between English and German with
respect to the that-trace effect; the aim of the present experiment was therefore to assess if these differences also lead to
difference in acceptability of resumptives in subject extraction in German.
Unlike English, embedded clauses in German are verb final, and the complementizer is obligatory (see (13-a)). However, complementizer-less embedding is possible for certain
matrix verbs; in this case the word order has to be verb second (V2) instead of verb final, and the complementizer has to
be omitted (see (13-b)).1

who claim-3sg Petra that t/he Anna fire-3sg
Wer behauptet Petra, entlässt t/er Anna?
who claim-3sg Petra fire-3sg t/he Anna

The other two types of embedding tested were the same as
for Experiment 1: whether-clauses and relative clauses (corresponding to the English examples (9) and (10)). Again, a
declarative control condition was included as a baseline to
compare with the subject questions.
Method Thirty-seven subjects were recruited over the Internet by postings to newsgroups and mailing lists. All subjects were self-reported native speakers of German. Linguists
and students of linguistics were excluded from the sample.
The experimental design was the same as in Experiment 1,
but German materials were used, as illustrated by the examples in (13-b). The experimental procedure was identical to
that of Experiment 1.

1 The status of V2-embedding has been disputed. For example,
Reis (1995) argues that this construction is in fact a case of parenthesis, rather than embedding.

Results The data were normalized and log-transformed as
in Experiment 1. Figure 2 graphs the mean judgments for all
four island conditions.
An A NOVA yielded main effects of I SLAND (F1 (3, 78) =
9.764, p < .0005; F2 (3, 24) = 3.942, p = .020) and R E SUMPTION (F1 (2, 52) = 88.483, p < .0005; F2 (2, 16) =
299.130, p < .0005). The main effect of E MBED DING failed to reach significance. The interactions I S LAND /R ESUMPTION (F1 (6, 156) = 18.055, p < .0005;
F2 (6, 48) = 12.888, p < .0005) and I SLAND/E MBEDDING
(F1 (3, 78) = 8.945, p < .0005; F2 (3, 24) = 5.802, p =
.004) were significant, while the E MBEDDING/R ESUMPTION
interaction was significant by subjects only (F1 (2, 52) =
6.631, p = .007; F2 (2, 16) = 1.581, p = .236), and the I S LAND /E MBEDDING /R ESUMPTION interaction failed to reach
significance.
A post-hoc Tukey test was conducted to further investigate
the interaction of I SLAND and R ESUMPTION. Its results are
tabulated in Table 3. We also carried out a series of Dunnett

tests to compare the single and double embedding conditions
with unembedded controls; see Table 4.
Discussion The results of this experiment largely confirm
the results of Experiment 1 for English. A significant interaction of resumption and embedding was found, and a posthoc test demonstrated that gaps were more acceptable than
resumptives in bare subordinate clauses (V2 clauses), just
like in English (see Table 3). However, we also found that
gaps were less acceptable than declaratives in German bare
clauses (see Figure 2(a)), while in English, there was no significant difference (see Figure 1(a)). In the other three island
conditions (that-, whether-, and relative clauses) the findings
in both languages were identical, i.e., gaps were as bad as
resumptives, while declaratives were significantly better than
both gaps and resumptives.
These results demonstrate the presence of that-trace effects
in German, despite claims to the contrary in the literature
(Lutz, 1996). Similar results were obtained by Featherston
(2005) (who only deals with gaps, not with resumptives).

in acceptability, even in the declarative control condition (i.e.,
even when extraction is present). This was particularly pronounced for the second level of embedding and for relative
clauses.
All three results contradict claims in the syntactic literature. This demonstrates that it is important to obtain experimental data for theoretically crucial constructions: the relevant data are complex and involve gradient acceptability
judgments which cannot be reliably obtained through the introspection of a single native speaker. We expect this to be the
case not only for resumption, but for a large number of theoretically relevant judgment data. Furthermore, our study also
demonstrates the usefulness of crosslinguistic experimentation, which has rarely been attempted before.

Regarding the effect of embedding, we found that single
and double embedded gapped sentences were less acceptable
than an unembedded control, in all four island conditions (see
Table 4). This is also what we found for subject extraction
in English. For resumptives, we found that double embedded
that-clauses were more acceptable than the unembedded control. This means that there is evidence for resumption reducing the unacceptability of embedding in this condition, i.e.,
for the “saving” effect of resumption described in the theoretical literature. However, that these “saved” clauses are still
strongly unacceptable. Note that this effect was not present in
subject extraction in English.
Finally, we found that embedding has an effect on acceptability in German, even for declaratives. This effect is consistent with the findings for English, though the effect is weaker
(it only extends to bare clauses, that-clauses, and relative
clauses).

Conclusion
In this paper, we presented an experimental study of resumptive pronouns, which in the theoretical linguistics literature
have been claimed to remedy the unacceptability caused by
extraction from islands. In particular, we investigated the interaction between resumption and the that-trace effect, i.e.,
the observation that subject extraction out of subordinate
clauses is acceptable only if the complementizer that is absent.
We obtained three main results: Firstly, we found that resumptive pronouns can not remedy island violations, contrary
to claims in the theoretical literature. For all types of embedding and for both languages we investigated (English and
German), we found that resumptive pronouns are seriously
unacceptable, and never better than the corresponding gaps
(there was one possible exception in the German data, see
Experiment 2). Secondly, we demonstrated the existence of
a that-trace effect in both English and German. While this
effect is well-documented for English, the theoretical literature has so far claimed the absence of this effect for German.
Thirdly, we found that embedding leads to a general decrease
