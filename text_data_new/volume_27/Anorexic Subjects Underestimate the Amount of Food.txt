peoples and anorexic patients capability to evaluate amounts

and odor of food on the perception of the amount. A group of
anorexic subjects was asked to evaluate how many biscuits
were used to prepare of a certain amount of broken biscuits.

Abstract
People affected by eating disorders often misjudge their food
intake. This misjudgement might be due to fear of eating and
of the amount of food eaten. This study contrasted normal

The anorexic subjects were also asked to evaluate the number
of a certain amount of broken biscuits that had been dyed
blue. The blue color altered both the aspect and the odor of
the biscuits. The evaluations given by the anorexic subjects
were compared to both the real number of biscuits and to the
parallel evaluations given by a control group of non eating
disordered people. Anorexic subjects reported a significantly
lower number of both altered and non-altered biscuits in
comparison to both the real number of biscuits and the
evaluations reported by the control group. There were no
significant differences between the evaluations of altered and
non altered biscuits of both anorexic subjects and control
subjects. The study suggests that anorexic subjects show an
altered perception of the amount of food. Altered perception
may play a role in the onset and maintenance of anorexia
nervosa.

Materials and Method
Sample

Objective
Energy intake and food consumption is influenced by many
factors. Among them, there are visual factors as the
evaluation of the amount and of the aspect of food (Albright
& Sterns, 1995). Both the classical models by Blundell &
Hill (1987) and by Both (1981) have proposed that the
perception of hunger and satiety integrates the cognitive set
of individual’s attitudes toward food with the internal
physiology of
neurotransmitters,
hormones,
and
metabolism. Research suggests that the hunger-satiety
system is altered in eating disordered subjects (Owen,
Halmi, Gibbs, & Smith, 1985). According to Garfinkel,
Moldofsky, & Garner (1979), anorexic subjects have an
absence of aversion to repeated highly sweet tastes (i.e.,
sucroses). Moreover, such a disturbance was stable over the
year and was not affected by weight change.
Other studies have examined the influence of visual
perception on hunger and satiety. Gosnell, Mitchell,
Lancaster, Burgard, Wonderlich, & Crosby (2001) found
that the amount of food presented to obese subjects
stimulates overeating or binge eating. Staiger, Dawe, &
McCarthy (2000) and Neudeck, Florin, & Tuschen-Caffier
(2001) found that the visual presentation of high-caloric
food elicited binge eating in bulimic subjects. Such an
association is also a common sense observation: a proverb
of the Italian popular wisdom says: “eyes are bigger than
mouths”, that means that the more the food is exposed to
glance the more the urge to eating and binge eating is
elicited. High-caloric food stimulates appetite also via their
tempting aspect and scent.
In our clinical experience anorexic subjects frequently
reported that during the mealtime they feel the
uncomfortable impression not to be able to reliably evaluate
the amount of served food. To our knowledge, there are no
study which examined the visual ability to evaluate exposed
food in anorexic subjects. The study compared visual
evaluation of food in anorexic subjects and normal controls.
Afterward, the study was repeated using artificially colored
food to evaluate the possible influence of color and odor.

1763

Thirty-six anorexic subjects were recruited in the eating
disorders unit of the Clinica Villa Margherita (Vicenza,
Italy), directed by dr. R. Ostuzzi, and in the eating disorders
unit of the ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) n° 6 "Friuli
Occidentale" of S. Vito al Tagliamento (Pordenone, Italy)
directed by dr. G. Luxardi. The criteria for inclusion in the
study were: DSM-IV diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa
ascertained using the SCID interview; minimum age of 14
years; ability to speak Italian with adequate fluency, absence
of cognitive disorders. All participants received detailed
information about the procedures and aims of the study, and
gave written informed consent. During the interview age,
height, weight, and possible past or current psychological
and/or psychopharmacological treatments were assessed.
Subjects were informed that all collected data would be
strictly confidential. All of them agreed to participate and
signed an informed consent form. Parental permission was
requested for subjects who were younger than 18 years old.
Two subjects were excluded because actually in remission
and presenting a normal BMI (20.66 and 20.86
respectively). Thus, 34 subjects took part in the study.
Twenty-seven patients presented the binging/purging
subtype of anorexia nervosa and 7 participants presented the
restricting subtype of anorexia nervosa.
The mean age of anorexic group at time of interview was
25.21 years (St. Dev. 6,23) ranging from 14 to 44 years. The
mean BMI of the patients was 15.52 (St. Dev. 1.02) ranging
from 14.03 to 17.28. The average age of the onset of the
eating disorder (as reported by participants) was 18.24 years
(St. Dev. 4.38) ranging from 9 to 27 years.
Forty normal control female subjects were recruited in a
high school and in a training school for domiciliary
assistants in the town of Cuneo (Italy), during a period of 2
month from May to June 2002. The subjects were asked to
report previous or current psychiatric disorders and
treatments and to complete the Eating Disorder Inventory
for a screening for eating disorders. Six subjects were
excluded from the study: 1 subject reported a diagnosis of
major depression, 3 subjects reported slight bulimic traits,
and 2 subjects were overweight (BMI 27,8 and 32,8
respectively). Thus, the control sample investigated in this
study comprised 34 participants.
The mean age of the control group at time of interview
was 22.47 years (St. Dev. 6,92) ranging from 15 to 40 years.
There were no significant difference of mean age between
the anorexic group and the normal controls.

Instruments and Procedure
The study was carried out in a laboratory situation in which
all the subjects were introduced in a room and exposed to a
plate fulfilled with 9 high caloric and tasty biscuits of a
famous Italian brand, each of them divided in 4 equal parts
by a crossing cut (36 parts in total). The subjects were

exposed to the food for the short time of 3 seconds. After 3
seconds, the biscuits were covered with a drape, and the
subjects were asked to evaluate the number of presented
broken biscuits. After a while all the subjects were
introduced in another room and exposed to another plate
fulfilled with 9 other biscuits of the same kind and brand
and divided in the same way, but with color and odor altered
using blue ink and ammonia. The 2 plates were exposed in
different rooms to prevent visual confrontation.
The t-test for equality of means was used to compare the
evaluations of anorexic subjects and normal controls, whilst
the one-sample t-test (test value=9) was used to compare the
evaluations of anorexic subjects and the real number of
biscuits. SPSS 10.0 (SPSS inc., 1999) was used to perform
statistical analysis.

Results
Anorexic patients evaluated a mean of 6.44 non altered
biscuits (st. dev. 2.26), whilst the normal subjects evaluated
a mean of 9.38 non altered biscuits (st. dev. 4.38). The
difference between the two groups was significant, i.e. t=3.478; Sig. (2-tailed)=.001. The difference between the
evaluations of non altered biscuits by the anorexic subjects
and the number of real biscuits was significant, i.e. t=6.605; Sig. (2-tailed)=.000.
Anorexic patients evaluated a mean of 6.14 altered
biscuits (st. dev. 1.88), whilst the normal subjects evaluated
a mean of 10.12 altered biscuits (st. dev. 5.93). The
difference between the two groups was significant, i.e. t=3.724; Sig. (2-tailed)=.001. The difference between the
evaluations of altered biscuits by the anorexic subjects and
the number of real altered biscuits was significant, i.e. t=8.863; Sig. (2-tailed)=.000.
There were no significant differences between the
evaluations of non altered and altered biscuits in both
anorexic subjects, i.e. t=.584; Sig. (2-tailed)=.561, and
normal controls, i.e. t=.582; Sig. (2-tailed)=.563.
Considering the two subtypes of anorexic subjects
separately, binging/purging anorexics evaluated a mean of
6.30 non altered biscuits (St. Dev. 2.40) and a mean of 5.85
altered biscuits (st. dev. 1.77). These results were both
significantly different from the evaluations of control
subjects, i.e. t=-3.498; Sig. (2-tailed)=.001 and t=-3.979;
Sig. (2-tailed)=.000, respectively. These results were also
both significantly different from the real number of biscuits,
i.e. t=-5.856; Sig. (2-tailed)=.000 and t=-9.245; Sig. (2tailed)=.000, respectively.
Restricting anorexics evaluated a mean of 7.00 non
altered biscuits (st. dev. 1.63) and a mean of 7.29 altered
biscuits (st. dev. 1.98). These results were both significantly
different from the evaluations of control subjects, i.e. t=2.449; Sig. (2-tailed)=.021; and t=-2.245; Sig. (2tailed)=.032 respectively. The number of non altered
biscuits was significantly lower from the real number of
biscuits, i.e. t=-3.240; Sig. (2-tailed)=.018, whilst the
number of altered biscuits was not significantly different

1764

from the real number of biscuits, i.e. t=-2.295; Sig. (2tailed)=.061.
There were no significant differences between the
evaluations of non altered and altered biscuits in both
binging/purging subtype anorexic subjects, i.e. t=.775; Sig.
(2-tailed)=.442, and restricting subtype anorexic subjects,
i.e. t=.295; Sig. (2-tailed)=.773.

Discussion
The study has shown that anorexic subjects tend to
underestimate in significant extent the amount of exposed
food in comparison to both the evaluations of non eating
disordered subjects and to the real amount of exposed food.
This underestimation is not influenced by artificial
alterations of color and odor. Considering the two
diagnostic subtypes of anorexia separately, the significant
underestimation is confirmed but in the case of the
estimation of altered biscuits in restricting anorexia, that is
not significantly lower than the real amount of biscuits.
However, the value of this finding is questioned, in
consequence of the small size of the sample of restricted
anorexics, only 7 subjects
The visual evaluation of the amount of food is the
opening phase of the hunger-satiety and eating process.
Thus, this study confirms previous works that have shown
that this process is altered in eating disordered subjects.
However, previous research examined mainly the following
phases of the process, specifically the effect of ingested
food on satiety. Research has shown that anorexic subjects
lack the satiety aversion to exceeding and repeated sweet
taste (Garfinkel, Moldofsky, & Garner, 1979). The
subsequent picture is that anorexic subjects would be
incapable to both estimate both the amount of food exposed
and the amount of eaten food. Thus both the phases
preceding (visual estimation of food) and following (lack of
satiety aversion) the mealtime are compromised. A further
clue of alteration of hunger and satiety in anorexia are the
findings that about 20-30% of anorexic people had a weight
increase before the onset of the disorder and that anorexic
girls often gain weight until obesity after the relapse
(Haiman & Devlin, 1999; Spurrell, Wilfley, Tanofsky, &
Brownell, 1997).
The disorder of the whole hunger-satiety process in
anorexic subjects is plausibly a maintaining factor for the
eating disorder itself (Hetherington & Rolls, 2001). Altered
interoceptive awareness, comprising also the confusion
regarding hunger and satiety, is a well known aspect of
eating disorder (Garner, Olmsted, Polivy, & Garfinkel,
1984; Miller, Redlich, & Steiner, 2003). The visual
underestimation of the amount of food could be a further
aspect of this lack of ability of anorexic subjects. In turn,
such perceptive confusion could underlie higher level
feelings of fear regarding food, eating, weight, and fat, that
could definitely pave the way and trigger the final cognitive
level, i.e. beliefs regarding the compelling necessity to
control eating and food to remove the painful turmoil of
such troubled and uncomfortable feelings. The assumption

or the feeling of needing self-control may trigger dietary
behaviors and restrictions that would enhance the subjective
sense of self-esteem and self-control, both of which are
pervasively negative, if not lacking without remedy, in the
anorexic subjects (Slade, 1982; Vitousek & Hollon, 1990;
Fairburn, Shafran, & Cooper, 1999).
An unbalanced hunger-satiety process may both precede
the eating disorder and be increased by the wrong eating
habits induced by the eating disorder itself. It is known that
wrong eating habits and disordered attitudes and beliefs
regarding weight and eating are frequent in the families of
eating disordered subjects (Woodside, Bulik, Halmi,
Fichter, Kaplan, Berrettini, Strober, Treasure, Lilenfeld,
Klump, & Kaye, 2002) and that parental obesity is a risk
factor for the development of eating disorders
(Vandereycken, 2003). One could even hypothesize a
genetic tendency to the hunger-satiety confusion. In
addition, there are also cultural and social factors underlying
such confusion. In fact, the tendency to underestimate both
the amount of food and the signs of satiety may be the
extreme form of a general issue of people living in
contemporary affluent societies. The tendency to
underestimate food intake and satiety is a protective factor
against food’s shortage and stimulates the accumulating fat
to survive to eventual food’s scarcity. However, in an
affluent era of food abundance and sedentary work
activities, as nowadays, the protective factor may become a
risk factor for overweight and obesity, for it plausibly
stimulates overeating. In addition, it is possible that a
genetic or learned incapability to correctly estimate the food
intake could be a risk factor even for anorexia nervosa. In
fact, such a incapability could enhance that abovementioned sense of insecurity and missing control
pervasively felt by anorexic subjects. Hence, it could be
stated that behind some anorexic subjects is masked an
obese girl or woman. A confirmation comes from another
study of this research team, that used the same experimental
procedure and found that also obese subjects usually
underestimate the amount of presented biscuits (Vinai,
Masante, Ruggiero, & Sassaroli, 2002).
Further studies using whole objects are necessary to
evaluate if this altered perception is an effect of a
perceptive bias or an inability to calculate how many whole
biscuits could produce that amount of broken biscuits.
Furthermore other studies are requested using not eatable
objects to evaluate if this perceptive bias is induced or not
by the view of the food.
At the light of this study, if confirmed, we can think that
sometimes, an obese, a bulimic or an anorexic person can be
only different end points of the same perceptive disorder.
