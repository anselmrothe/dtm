The Origins of Context Effects
Given these myriad context effects, while some have argued
that number is critical for quantifier comprehension, others
have proposed that quantifiers are not about number at all
(Moxey & Sanford, 1993). Yet, clearly as the number of
objects increases, the appropriateness of high magnitude
quantifiers increases. There are two key issues emerging
from this debate. First, the existence of context effects is
important in its own right, but discussion of the issue of
where such effects come from is noticeably absent from this
literature. Why is it that set size, expected frequency,
relative size etc. matter? The second issue is intricately
bound up with the answer to this question. It has been
assumed in the quantifier literature that the actual number of
objects in a scene being described is the number used to
map onto comprehension of vague quantifiers. Yet there is
much evidence that, under time pressure conditions, people
do not give very accurate judgments about the number of
objects there are in a scene. When a small number of objects
is presented in a visual scene, we are able to know the
number of objects present almost instantly (an effect called
subitizing in the number literature). However, when the
number of objects increases, we are much less accurate in
our judgments of how many objects there are in a visual
scene. Hence, we will argue that in the quantifier literature
the lack of success of scalar approaches to quantifiers, and
the corresponding abandonment of this approach, has been a
result of a conflation of number with the actual number of
objects being referred to. We will show that the
“psychological” numbers returned from visual attentional
constraints under time pressure allow number to predict the
appropriateness of natural language quantifiers much more
successfully. Specifically, in three experiments we uncover
several new context effects for vague quantifiers and show
that the same effects also occur for number judgments.
However, we first briefly overview the literature on object
enumeration with a view to predicting these new context
effects.

Abstract
The literature on vague quantifiers in English (words like
“some”, “many”, etc.) is replete with demonstrations of
context effects. Yet little attention has been paid to the issue of
where such effects come from. We explore the possibility that
they emanate from a visual attentional bottleneck which limits
the accuracy of judgments of number in visual scenes under
conditions of time pressure. We present the results of 3
experiments which reveal a range of new context effects on
the acceptability of vague quantifiers to describe a number of
objects in a visual scene, and show corresponding effects on
judgments of number using the same visual scenes under
speeded conditions.

Introduction
Talking about numbers of objects in a visual scene often
involves the use of descriptions of quantity which are vague.
Furthermore, quantifiers, whether they be of number (e.g.,
many), amount (e.g., much), or time/frequency (e.g., often)
pervade natural language, and therefore constitute an
essential part of the lexicon for the child to acquire, and
consequently for integration into NL systems. An
understanding of quantifiers is often largely couched in terms
of the notion that quantifiers refer to points on a scale. In its
most extreme form, the temptation is to treat quantifiers in
terms of a quantifier-to-number mapping (e.g., Bass, Cascio
& O’Connor, 1984; Reyna, 1981). In computational terms, a
scene can be parsed for the number of entities present, and
the mapping between the number and the quantifier
associated with the appropriate point on the scale can be
easily achieved. However, there is compelling evidence that
the comprehension and production of quantifiers is affected
by a range of factors which go beyond the number of objects
present, including the relative size of the objects involved in
the scene (e.g., Hormann, 1983, Newstead & Coventry,
2000), the expected frequency of those objects based on prior
experience (e.g., Moxey & Sanford, 1993), the functionality
present in the scene (Newstead & Coventry, 2000), and the
need to control the pattern of inference of those involved in
the communication (e.g., Moxey, Sanford & Dawydiak,
2001). To give an example of one of these context effects
(expected frequency in this case), a few people outside a
cinema is associated with more people than a few people
outside a fire station (Moxey & Sanford, 1993).

Visual Object Enumeration
There is much evidence that participants do not give very
accurate numerosity judgements under time pressure. These
studies have revealed at least three strategies used by the
brain: a fast and accurate processing of small groups of four
or fewer items in almost constant response time (subitizing),

506

Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002; Barsalou, 1999; Coventry &
Garrod, 2004; Zwaan, 2004).

a slow process of serial counting of more than five (less than
9) objects, and a more error prone estimation process for
larger groups of objects (>9) (e.g. Trick & Pylyshyn, 1993,
Mandler & Shebo, 1982). Based on these findings, the focus
of the past research has been mainly on the distinction
between subitizing and counting phenomena, using fewer
than 10 objects, while a few publications have reported
experiments on a larger range (~20). An ongoing debate
among those who have proposed theories to explain this
dichotomy is whether the brain uses completely different
cognitive processes or this is a result of a single process but
due to different levels of difficulty along a continuum of
difficulty in processing (Piazza et al., 2002). However, from
our point of view it is clear that it takes time to count objects,
and therefore it is likely that participants, when producing or
comprehending quantifiers, are likely to use estimates of
numbers of objects in the scene rather than the actual
number of objects present. If this is the case, then one might
expect that the estimated number would impact in their
judgements about the appropriateness of quantifers rather
than the actual number.
If this argument is correct, then we can make some
predictions regarding the parameters in a visual scene which
may affect both estimates of number and consequently
ratings of vague quantifiers to describe the scenes. For the
first two experiments reported below, participants were
instructed to rate how appropriate sentences were to
describe visual scenes. We presented two types of objects in
the scene being described: striped fish and white fish. The
number of striped fish and white fish is systematically
varied, from 3-18 for the fish in focus (fish quantified in the
sentence describing the scene), increased in increments of 3,
and 0-18 fish for the other fish in the scene (fish not
quantified in the sentence describing the scene). We
predicted that the number of other fish present in the scene
would affect the acceptability of quantifiers to describe the
scenes. We also manipulated two other parameters. First, in
Experiment 1 we manipulated grouping. Either the fish of a
given type were grouped together or mixed together (see
Figure 1). We expected that grouping would affect
judgments as grouping the fish together makes them easier
to count, while mixing them up does not. Second, given
existing effects of relative size (Newstead & Coventry,
2000) we also expected that the spacing between objects
might affect judgments of quantifiers as spacing effects the
overall area the fish cover. This is tested in Experiment 2.
Finally in Experiment 3 we presented the scenes involving
the same manipulations as those used in Experiments 1 and
2, but as a numerosity judgment task. Participants saw the
scenes for 500msec and had to give an estimate for the
number of fish present. We show that the results of
Experiment 3 mirror the results of Experiments 1 and 2, and
therefore that there is a correspondence between number
estimates in the scenes being described and context effects
for vague quantifiers. In other words, quantifier judgments
are grounded in perception, consonant with recent theories
of grounding language in perception (e.g., Glenberg, 1997;

Experiment 1
Participants
Twenty undergraduate students participated for payment.
Design and Materials
The task involved participants rating how appropriate
sentences of the form There are [QUANTIFIER]
striped/white fish were to describe given pictures of fish.
The quantifiers used were a few, few, several, many, and
lots of. Therefore the terms used included two low and two
high magnitude quantifiers, together with a mid-range
magnitude quantifier. The scenes used varied the number of
striped and white fish present. The fish mentioned in the
sentence to be rated will hereafter be calls the focus fish, and
the other fish not mentioned will be called the other fish, but
we varied whether the white fish or striped fish were the
focus fish. The number of focus fish varied from 3-18 in
increments of three, and the number of other fish varied
from 0-18, again in increments of three. In this experiment
we manipulated a second variable: whether the focus fish
were grouped together or mixed in with the other fish.
When scenes contained both striped and white fish either the
fish were arranged in groups, with the focus fish all at the
top or bottom of the picture (but with equal spacing between
fish), or alternatively the fish were randomly mixed together
(see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Example of a mixed scene used in Experiment 1.
Procedure
Participants were instructed that they had to rate how
appropriate each sentence is to describe each picture.
Sentences were presented together under each picture,
always in the same order (from low to high magnitude
quantifiers). Participants were asked to circle a number on
the seven-point rating scale beside each sentence, where 1 =
totally inappropriate and 7 = totally appropriate. The order
of pictures was randomized.
Results and discussion
In order to analyze the data, we used a four-way withinsubjects analyses of variance. The variables were grouping
(grouped or mixed) x number of focus objects (3, 6, 9, 12,
15, 18) x number of other object (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18) x
quantifier (a few, few, several, many, lots of). To begin with,

as expected there were main effects of number of focus
objects, F(5, 95) = 11.89, p < 0.0001, MSe = 6.2, of
quantifier, F(4, 76) = 36.66, p < 0.0001, MSe = 22.6, and
there was a significant two-way interaction between number
of focus objects and quantifier, F(20, 380) = 106.6, p <
0.0001, MSe = 7.4. Low magnitude quantifiers (a few, few)
were rated as being more appropriate to describe scenes
with small numbers of focus objects than high magnitude
quantifiers (many, lots of), and conversely high magnitude
quantifiers were rated as being more appropriate to describe
scenes with large numbers of focus objects than low
magnitude quantifiers. There results are consistent with
those found in previous studies (e.g., Newstead & Coventry,
2000).
Of most interest were significant interactions
involving number of other objects and grouping. First, there
were significant two-way interactions between number of
focus objects and number of other objects, F(25, 475) =
1.90, p < 0.01, MSe = 1.1, between number of other objects
and quantifier, F(20, 380) = 22.55, p < 0.0001, MSe = 1.2,
and the three-way interaction between number of focus
objects, number of other objects and quantifier was also
significant, F(100, 1900) = 4.19, p < 0.0001, MSe = 1.0.
This interaction is displayed in Figure 2.

Experiment 2
This experiment, like Experiment 1, manipulated the
number of focus fish and number of other fish. The design
was identical to Experiment 1, but this time instead of
varying grouping, spacing between fish was varied instead.
Either fish were spaced far apart (5cm between the centre of
mass of each object; each fish had a diameter of 1.5 cm) or
close together (2 cm between the centre of mass of each
object).

For low magnitude quantifiers ratings are higher for the
mixed scenes when there are 9 fish or more, and conversely
for high magnitude quantifiers ratings are lower for the
mixed scenes when there are 9 fish or more.
So, the results of the first experiment reveal two
new “context” effects for quantifiers. Both grouping and
number of other fish present affect judgments of the
appropriateness of quantifiers to describe visual scenes. The
second experiment focuses on the spacing between fish to
investigate whether this similarly affects sentence
comprehension with quantifiers.

Experiment 1.

Participants
Twenty undergraduate students participated for payment.

These results show that the number of other objects present
affects appropriateness of quantifiers to describe scenes. For
low magnitude quantifiers, the larger the number of other
objects present, the more acceptable the quantifier to
describe the number of focus objects. Conversely, with high
magnitude quantifiers, ratings are higher when the number
of other objects is low. Hence, the other objects appear to be
being used as a contrast set for judgments about the
appropriateness of quantifiers used to describe the focus set.
Second, there was a significant two-way
interaction between grouping and quantifier, F(4, 76) =
8.38, p < 0.0001, MSe = 1.2, and the three-way interaction
between grouping, number of focus objects and quantifier

Results
The results were analysed using a four-way within-subjects
analyses of variance. The variables were spacing (large
spacing or small spacing) x number of focus objects (3, 6, 9,
12, 15, 18) x number of other object (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18) x
quantifier (a few, few, several, many, lots of).
To begin with, as expected there were main effects
of number of focus objects, F(5, 95) = 13.10, p < 0.0001,
MSe = 5.0, of quantifier, F(4, 76) = 14.67, p < 0.0001, MSe
= 32.1, and there was a significant two-way interaction
between number of focus objects and quantifier, F(20, 380)

and quantifier, F(100, 1900) = 2.70, p < 0.0001, MSe = 1.4,
and the four-way interaction between spacing, number of
focus objects, number of other objects and quantifier was
also significant, F(100, 1900) = 1.51, P < 0.01, MSe =- 1.0.
These interactions show that the effects of spacing and
number of other fish depend on the quantifier and number of
focus objects present.
Overall, the results of the second experiment
replicate the effect of number of other objects on quantifier
comprehension and introduce another new “context” effect:
spacing and number of other fish present both affect
judgments of the appropriateness of quantifiers to describe
visual scenes. The third experiment examines whether
number of other objects, spacing and grouping impact on
judgments about the number of objects present in a visual
scene.

= 80.23, p < 0.0001, MSe = 8.0. Consistent with the results
of Experiment 1, low magnitude quantifiers (a few, few)
were rated as being more appropriate to describe scenes
with small numbers of focus objects than high magnitude
quantifiers (many, lots of), and conversely high magnitude
quantifiers were rated as being more appropriate to describe
scenes with large numbers of focus objects than low
magnitude quantifiers.
Of most interest were significant interactions
involving number of other objects and spacing. First, there
were significant two-way interactions between number of
focus objects and number of other objects, F(25, 475) =
2.66, p < 0.0001, MSe = 1.0, between number of other
objects and quantifier, F(20, 380) = 20.35, p < 0.0001, MSe
= 2.6, and the three-way interaction between number of
focus objects, number of other objects and quantifier was
also significant, F(100, 1900) = 3.37, p < 0.0001, MSe =
1.5. These interactions mirrored those found in Experiment
1 (see Figure 2). For low magnitude quantifiers, the larger
the number of other objects present, the more acceptable the
quantifier to describe the number of focus objects.
Conversely, with high magnitude quantifiers, ratings are
higher when the number of other objects is low. So, again
the other objects appear to be being used as a contrast set for
judgments about the appropriateness of quantifiers used to
describe the focus set.
Second, there was a significant three-way
interaction between spacing, number of focus objects and
quantifier, F(20, 380) = 2.01, p < 0.001, MSe = 1.2. This
interaction is displayed in Figure 4.

Experiment 3
Given the results of Experiments 1 and 2, we were
interested in establishing whether the effects found may be
due to estimates of the number of objects present in the
scenes to be described. Consistent with the number literature
reviewed above, when the number of objects increases
beyond a small number, we expected that the estimated
numbers given by participants would deviate from the actual
number of objects present. Furthermore, we were also
interesting to establish whether spacing and grouping also
affect number estimates. Grouping objects together makes
them easier to count, and spacing affects the total
area/amount of clutter present in the scene, so we expected
that estimates would be affected by both variables.

Procedure
Participants were instructed to estimate as accurately as they

At the start of a block participants were instructed to
respond to a particular type of fish (white or striped).
Practice trials were given at the start of each block to ensure
participants were estimating the right type of fish, and a
reminder prompt was given at the beginning of test trials.
For each trial, a fixation cross was presented in the middle
of the screen for 500msec followed by the scene for
500msec followed by a mask (a chequered board) presented
with a space in it in which to type estimates. Participants
responded by typing in their estimated numbers using the

Results
We were interested in establishing whether number of other
fish, grouping and spacing affected judgments about the
estimated number of fish present. We initially looked at the
data, and it became clear that participants were subitizing
when there were only three focus objects as there was no
variance in estimates for these scenes. Therefore, scenes
with 3 focus fish were dropped from the analyses. The
remaining data were analyzed using a four-way withinsubjects analyses of variance. The variables were spacing
(large spacing or small spacing) x grouping (grouped or
mixed) x number of focus objects (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18) x
number of other objects (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18). To begin with,
there was a main effect of number of focus objects, F(4, 76)
= 242.85, p < 0.0001, MSe = 16.5. As the number of fish in
focus increased, so did the estimates. However, consistent
with the number literature, when the number increased
above 6 fish participants underestimated the number of fish
(mean estimates of 8.11, 10.39, 12.19 and 13.88 for 9, 12,
15, 18 fish respectively). There were also main effects of
spacing F(1, 19) = 6.94, p < 0.05, MSe = 12.9, and of
grouping, F(1, 19) = 14.1, p < 0.0001, MSe = 14.1. Overall
estimates were higher when the fish were spaced close
together (M = 10.31) than when they were spaced far apart
(M = 9.89), and when they were grouped (M = 10.62) than
when they were mixed (M = 9.58).
There was a significant two-way interaction
between spacing and number of focus objects, F(4, 76) =
3.90, p < 0.01,l MSe = 5.1. This is displayed in Figure 5. An
effect of spacing was only found for higher numbers of fish
(12, 15, 15, 18).

These results show that grouping, spacing and
number of other objects all affect estimates of the number of
objects present in a visual scene when the scene is presented
for a short period of time. Critically, the effects of grouping
and number of other objects only occur when there are
larger numbers of objects present. This is consistent with the
notion that for small numbers participants are able to
subitize, and hence to return accurate number estimates
(e.g., Trick & Pylyshyn, 1993).

General Discussion
When people make judgments about the appropriateness of
quantifiers to describe scenes involving a number of objects,
we suspected that they were likely to make judgments based
on estimates of the number of objects present rather than
counting the number of objects present. The results of the
experiments indeed support the claim that there is a
correspondence between estimations of number and the
ratings of the appropriateness of quantifiers to describe the
same scenes.
Three new effects on both quantifier rating and
number judgments have been uncovered. Most strikingly,
when judging number of objects (Experiment 3), both
spacing and grouping affect judgments, but only when the
number of objects in the scene rises beyond the point where
participants are able to subitize. Similarly, both these
variables affect quantifier ratings, but again only when the
number of focus objects rises above the subitizing region.
Notably, no context effects are found for quantifiers when
only 3 objects are present in scenes, and in the number
judgment experiment participants were so accurate at
estimating the number there was no variance in the data for
these scenes.

These results indeed suggest a correspondence
between estimates of numbers of objects in a scene and
context effects for quantifiers. Counting large numbers of
objects in scenes is effortful and time consuming, and would
get in the way of communication. Similarly, when judging a
number of objects, it is to be expected that we would evolve
mechanisms of estimating number without counting.
Furthermore, it could be that other context effects noted in
the quantifier literature emerge from this relation. For
example, knowing how many objects are in a set affects the
likelihood that a certain number of objects from that set is
present. So one might predict expected frequency effects
when estimating number, just as one gets the effect with
quantifiers. We are currently examining whether this, and
other context effects indeed affect number judgments.
More generally, the argument that language
comprehension maps onto perceptual processing is
consistent with a growing literature showing relations
between language comprehension and perception (e.g.,
Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg & Kaschak, 2000; Coventry &
Garrod, 2004; Zwaan, 2004). We are currently developing a
computational model which grounds the meaning of
quantifiers directly in perceptual representations of the
scene being described. Preliminary simulation experiments
show that the part of the model trained to do “psychological
counting” uses some of the same factors found to be
important in the present experiments (Rajapakse et al.,
under review). Furthermore this model is a development of
a model we have previously developed for spatial
prepositions (Coventry et al., in press). Such an approach
affords the possibility of linking context effects across
syntactic categories, which may ultimately lead to a set of
common perceptual parameters important across a wide
range of syntactic categories. As a start, it has been noted
that prepositions and quantifiers do indeed share some of the
same perceptual determinants affecting their situation
specific meaning (Newstead & Coventry, 2000; Coventry &
Garrod, 2004; Coventry et al., in press).
