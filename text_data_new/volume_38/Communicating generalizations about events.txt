Abstract
Habitual sentences (e.g. Bill smokes.) generalize an event over
time, but how do you know when a habitual sentence is true?
We develop a computational model and use this to guide experiments into the truth conditions of habitual language. In Expts. 1 & 2, we measure participants’ prior expectations about
the frequency with which an event occurs and validate the
predictions of the model for when a habitual sentence is acceptable. In Expt. 3, we show that habituals are sensitive to
top-down moderators of expected frequency: It is the expectation of future tendency that matters for habitual language.
This work provides the mathematical glue between our intuitive theories’ of others and events and the language we use
to talk about them. Keywords: events; generics; pragmatics;
Bayesian data analysis; Bayesian cognitive model

Figuring out that a person or thing tends to exhibit a behavior can be crucial and hard-won knowledge. It is not surprising then that language has ways to convey this information
about propensity: Bill smokes, That man steals from children,
My car doesn’t start. These are called habitual sentences.
Like many other linguistic means of conveying generalizations, the truth-conditions of habituals are extremely flexible:
If Bill smoked three cigarettes last month, can you say that
Bill smokes? If he smoked a pack last week, but just swore a
solemn oath to quit? In this paper we present the first empirical data on the felicity of habitual sentences and describe
a formal model of habitual interpretation, based on recent
Bayesian models of the pragmatics of vague language.
Linguists have pointed out the parallel between habituals
like Bill smokes and generic sentences like Swans are white
(Carlson, 1977, 2005; Cohen, 1999). Both convey generalizations (about events and categories, respectively), and both
exhibit dramatic flexibility in their truth conditions: Swans
are white even though there are black swans, and it may the
case that Bill smokes even if he goes without a cigarette for
an entire family vacation. Indeed, cases like Mosquitos carry
malaria (wherein only a tiny percentage have the property)
seem to parallel habitual sentences of rare actions like Susan
writes novels. Susan may only have written 3 novels in her
life, but still this seems like a valid generalization to convey.
In this paper, we take the analogy between generic and habitual language seriously by elaborating a recent computational theory of generic language to derive predictions for the
truth conditions of habitual sentences. The theory of Tessler
and Goodman (under review) posits that the semantics of a
generic statement is an uncertain threshold on the degree of
property prevalence (i.e. how many instances of the kind have
the feature) and derives context-sensitive meanings through
pragmatic inference given the distribution of property prevalence (i.e. in general, what prevalences are likely across different categories). We adapt this theory to explain habituals
by adjusting the underlying degree to be the propensity to take

part in an event (e.g. how often does a person tend to do an action) and derive predictions for felicity judgments of a range
of habituals. In Expt. 1, we measure a priori beliefs about
how frequently people do a diverse set of actions. In Expt. 2,
we use those priors and the pragmatic theory to make predictions about the truth conditions of habitual sentences under
different frequencies of action.
If habituals (and generics) are truly language for conveying
generalizations, it would be useful for them to reflect expectations, not merely observations. Is the underlying dimension
for habituals the actual, past frequency of the event (e.g. how
often Bill has actually smoked in the past week) or the predictive probability that this event will occur in the near future
(e.g. how likely it is that Bill will smoke next week)? In Expts. 3a & 3b, we show that the object of communication is a
speaker’s prediction about the future frequency of action, and
not past frequency. This has important implications about the
relationship between linguistic generalizations and intuitive
theories, which we explore briefly in the discussion.

Computational model
A habitual sentence expresses a generalization about the tendency of an individual to participate in a kind of event.
For a given individual (e.g. B ILL) and an event or behavior
(e.g. SMOKING), we refer to the rate at which the individual participates in the event for a given time window as the
propensity, denoted λ. A natural denotation for the habitual
is a simple threshold on propensity λ > τ (c.f. Cohen, 1999),
yet no fixed value for τ would lead to the observed flexibility of truth conditions (e.g. Bill smokes vs. writes novels).
Building on Lassiter and Goodman (2013, 2015), we posit
that this threshold is not a fixed property of the language, but
is established by pragmatic inference.
We model a speaker S2 who reasons about a pragmatic listener L1 ; this listener is considering the propensity of a certain behavior of an individual. The listener L1 has uncertainty
about the appropriate threshold for the habitual in this context
(τ ∼ Uniform over possible frequencies), and reasons about
what an informative speaker S1 would be likely to say. The
hypothetical speaker S1 in turn reasons about an idealized literal listener L0 , who has access to the threshold τ (i.e. S1
believes L0 will interpret him in exactly the way he means).
Writing the propensity as λ, this leads to a set of equations:

1655

PS2 (u | λ) ∝

exp (α2 · ln

Z
τ

PL1 (λ, τ | u) dτ)

(1)

PL1 (λ, τ | u) ∝

PS1 (u | λ, τ) · P(λ) · P(τ)

(2)

PS1 (u | λ, τ) ∝

exp (α1 · ln PL0 (λ | u, τ))

(3)

PL0 (λ | u, τ) ∝

δ [[u]](λ,τ) P(λ).

(4)

We take the speakers S1 and S2 to consider two utterances: the
habitual, with [[u]](λ, τ) := λ > τ, or nothing (staying silent),
with [[u]](λ, τ) := True, and to select utterances softmax optimally, with a degree of optimality governed by α1 and α2 ,
respectively. Equation 1 can then be interpreted as a model of
felicity or truth judgments (Degen & Goodman, 2014; Tessler
& Goodman, under review). The speaker will choose to produce the habitual when the true propensity λ is more likely
under L1 ’s posterior given the habitual than under her prior
(implied by S2 “staying silent”). A fully implemented version of the model can be found at http://forestdb.org/
models/habituals-cogsci2016.html.
The prior, P(λ) in Eqs. 2 and 4, specifies prior beliefs about
the propensity of a specific event or behavior (e.g. SMOKING)
across a set of different individuals. A priori, it is unclear how
far to extend this contrast set: Does it include beliefs about
all people, or just individuals within a predefined subclass
e.g. individuals of the same gender or the same age? This is
important because the meaning of the habitual (the threshold
τ) is derived with respect to the prior. If the priors differed
by gender (e.g., in the propensity to WEAR A BRA) and if
language interpreters took the prior to be with respect to a
particular gender, the model would predict differences in the
truth conditions by gender (e.g., in Susan wears a bra. vs.
Bill wears a bra.). We explore this issue in Expts. 1 & 2.

Experiment 1: Prior elicitation
In this experiment we elicit the prior P(λ) for different events
in order to generate model predictions for corresponding habituals. Given that some individuals rarely or never engage
in an event, while others do quite frequently, we would expect the prior to be a mixture distribution between (at least)
these two possibilities, similar in spirit to Zero-inflated or
Hurdle Models of epidemiological data (Rose, Martin, Wannemuehler, & Plikaytis, 2006). Indeed, there may be more
than these two possibilities, corresponding to individuals with
different traits or demographics (e.g., different expected frequencies depending on age or gender).

Methods
Participants We recruited 40 participants from Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk. Participants were restricted to those with
U.S. IP addresses and who had at least a 95% work approval
rating. The experiment took on average 12 minutes and participants were compensated $1.25 for their work.
Materials We created thirty-one events organized into pairs
or triplets from 5 different conceptual categories: food and
drug (e.g. eats caviar, eats peanut butter), work (e.g. sells
things on eBay, sells companies), clothing (e.g. wears a suit,
wears a bra), entertainment (e.g. watches professional football, watches space launches) and hobbies (e.g. runs, hikes).
Items were chosen to intuitively cover a range of likely frequencies of action, as well as to provide a minimal comparison to another item by having a common superordinate action
(e.g. eating caviar vs. peanut butter).
Procedure For each event, participants were asked two ques-

tions, with associated dependent measures:
1. “How many {men, women} have DONE ACTION before?”
Participants responded “N out of every J.” by entering a
number for N and choosing J from a drop-down menu (options: {1000 - 10 million}; default: 1000).
2. “For a typical {man, woman} who has DONE ACTION before, how frequently does he or she DO ACTION?”
Participants responded “M times in K.” by entering a number for M and choosing K from a drop-down menu (options: {week, month, year, 5 years}; default: year).
For example, one set read: “How many men have smoked
cigarettes before?”; “For a typical man who has smoked
cigarettes before, how frequently does he smoke cigarettes?”
We anticipated there might be different beliefs about the
frequency of events depending on whether the actor is male
or female, so we asked about both genders. Participants
answered both questions for each gender on each slide (4
questions total per slide, order of male / female randomized between-subjects), and every participant completed all
31 items in random order. The experiment in full can be
viewed at http://stanford.edu/˜mtessler/habituals/
experiments/priors/priors-2.html.

Data analysis and results
We built a Bayesian data analysis model for this prior elicitation task. Question 1 elicits the proportion of people who
have done an action before. We model this data as coming
from a Beta distribution: d1 ∼ Beta(γ1 , ξ1 ). Question 2 elicits the rate, or relative frequency, with which a person does
the action. This was modeled by a log-normal distribution:
ln d2 ∼ Gaussian(µ2 , σ2 ). Each item was modeled independently for each gender. We implemented this model using the
probabilistic programming language WebPPL (Goodman &
Stuhlmüller, 2014), and found the credible values of the parameters by running MCMC for 100,000 iterations, discarding the first 50,000 for burnin.
The priors elicited cover a range of possible parameter values as intended (Figure 1, scatter), resulting in parametrized
distributions of dramatically different shapes (insets). We
observe a correlation in our items between the mean % of
Americans who have DONE ACTION before (Question 1) and
the mean log-frequency of action (Question 2) (r1,2 = 0.74).
Items that tend to be more popular actions also tend to be
more frequent actions (e.g. wears socks) and visa-versa (e.g.
steals cars), though there are notable exceptions (e.g. plays
the banjo is not popular but done frequently when done at all,
as is smokes cigarettes; goes to the movies is a popular activity though not done very often). This diversity is relevant
because the speaker model (Eq. 1) will produce habitual sentences (e.g. Sam goes to the movies vs. the ballet.) contingent
on the shape of the prior distribution.
From the inferred parameters and assumed functional
forms, we get an inferred P(λ) modeled as a mixture of individuals with the possibility of carrying out the action and
those without the possibility of doing it. That is, P(λ) was

In addition to specifying the correct way to combine our
two prior-elicitation questions, using this inferred prior in
our language model resolves two technical difficulties: (1)
It smooths effects that are clearly results of the response format1 and (2) it better captures the tails of the prior distribution
which have relatively little data and need to be regularized by
the analysis. Figure 1 (right) shows example inferred priors.
Some items show substantial differences between the genders (e.g. wears a bra) and some show subtle differences (e.g.
watches professional football). We will explore the possibility of different truth conditions for habituals of different gendered characters in Experiment 2, for select items with priors
that differ substantially by gender.

Experiment 2: Felicity judgments
A present-tense habitual sentence is of the form SINGULAR
NOUN PHRASE + PRESENT TENSE SIMPLE VERB PHRASE
(e.g. Bill smokes cigarettes.). We next explore the endorsements of habituals of this form made from the items whose
propensity priors were measured in Experiment 1.
1 For

example, a very common rating is 1 time per year. Presumably participants would be just as happy reporting approximately 1
time per year; the raw data does not reflect this due to demands of
the dependent measure.

Participants We recruited 150 participants from MTurk. To
arrive at this number, we performed a Bayesian precision
analysis to determine the minimum sample size necessary to
reliably ensure 95% posterior credible intervals no larger than
0.3 for a parameter whose true value is 0.5 and for which the
data is a 2 alternative forced choice. This analysis revealed a
minimum sample size of 50 per item; since participants only
completed about one third of the items, we recruited 150 participants. The experiment took 4 minutes on average and participants were compensated $0.55 for their work.
Procedure and materials On each trial, participants were
presented with a past frequency statement for a given event
of the form: “In the past M {weeks, months, years}, PERSON
DID X 3 times”. For example, In the past month, Bill smoked
cigarettes 3 times. The particular intervals used (number M
and window {weeks, months, years}) were selected after examining the predictions of the speaker model (Eq. 1), for each
item independently, to yield a variety of predicted endorsement rates. The items were the same as in Expt. 1.
Participants were asked whether they agreed or disagreed
with the corresponding habitual sentence: “PERSON DOES X”
(e.g. Bill smokes cigarettes). Participants saw 25 out of the 31
items paired randomly with a male or female character name;
the other 6 trials were presented with both male and female
names (on separate trials; 37 trials total) to explore the nature
of the contrast class (see Model section). The experiment in
full can be viewed at http://stanford.edu/˜mtessler/

Results
Behavioral results On each trial of the experiment, the participant was told a person did a particular action 3 times during some time window. Figure 2 (left) shows the correspondence between the frequency of the event (normalizing to a
5-year time scale and taking the logarithm) and the felicity
of the corresponding habitual sentence. It is clear that a habitual sentence can receive strong agreement even when the
actions are very infrequent (log frequency ∼ 1; 3 times in
a 5-year interval; e.g. writes novels, steals cars). We also
see even when actions are done relatively frequently (e.g. 3
times in a one month interval; log frequency ∼ 5), there are
habitual sentences participants are reluctant to endorse completely (e.g. wears socks, drinks coffee). In our data, actions
completed with a high frequency (3 times in a one week interval; log frequency ∼ 6.5) receive at least 75% endorsement,
though there is still variability among them (e.g. between 1025% of people disagree with wears a watch and wears a bra).
Overall, frequency of action predicts only a fraction of the
variability in responses (r2 (93) = 0.33). For actions that are
done on the time scale of years or longer (lower median of
frequency), frequency itself no longer explains the endorsements (r2 (50) = 0.07)
We further examined the six items for which we observed
gender differences in the prior elicitation task (Expt. 1). We
find no differences between endorsements of the habitual of
characters with male and female names, and overall, the mean
endorsements by gender are strongly correlated r(93) = 0.91.
This may be because the felicity of habitual sentences depends on a comparison to individuals of both genders (i.e, the

contrast class is other people; not just other men or women).
Less interestingly, the lack of a difference may be the result
of gender being not very salient in our paradigm, perhaps because the names used were not sufficiently gendered.
Model fit and results We used the pragmatic speaker model
S2 (Eq. 1) with the priors elicited above (Expt. 1) to predict
felicity judgments in Expt. 2, assuming the target propensity
(to be conveyed by S2 ) is the provided frequency. Because we
observe no difference between the felicity judgments for habituals of male and female characters, we use a 50% mixture
of the inferred priors for each gender to construct a single frequency distribution P(λ) across individuals. The model has
two free parameters—the speaker optimality parameters, αi ,
in Eqs. 1 & 3. We use Bayesian data analytic techniques to
integrate over these parameters (Lee & Wagenmakers, 2014),
comparing the posterior predictive distribution to the empirical data in Expt. 2. To construct the posterior predictive distribution over responses, we collected 2 MCMC chains of
100,000 iterations, discarding the first 50,000 iterations for
burn in. The Maximum A-Posteriori value and 95% highest
probability density interval for α1 is 19.3 [14.9,19.9] and α2
is 1.5 [1.4,1.6].
As shown in Figure 2, right, the probabilistic pragmatics
model does a good job of accounting for the variability in responses (r2 (93) = 0.94), including actions done on the time
scale of years or more (r2 (50) = 0.92). The model decides
when the habitual is a useful way to describe the person’s
behavior, assuming that what the person did in the past is
representative. This raises an interesting question: Does the
propensity communicated by the habitual indicate an objective, past frequency or a subjective, future expectation?

Experiment 3: Objective frequency versus
subjective expectation
While past frequency is often a good indicator of future tendency, people can change abruptly due to a variety of decisions and outside events. Does habitual language communicate propensity in terms of past frequency or future expectations? In this set of experiments, we address this by introducing causal factors that enable or prevent future actions
(e.g. buying cigarettes; developing an allergy). In Expt. 3a,
we measure predictive frequency when past frequency alone
is observed and when these causal factors are introduced. In
Expt. 3b, we examine felicity judgments of the habitual sentence (e.g. John smokes cigarettes.; John eats peanut butter.)
in the presence of these causal modifiers. This will allow us to
test whether habituals are best explained by a speaker S2 who
communicates the known past or expected future frequency.

Experiment 3a: Prediction elicitation
Methods We recruited 120 participants from MTurk, using
the same criterion as Expt. 2. The experiment took 4 minutes
on average and participants were compensated $0.40.
The procedure was identical to Expt. 2 except for the inclusion of a second sentence on a subset of trials and the use
of a different dependent measure. On all trials, participants
were presented with a past frequency sentence (see Expt. 2).
Additionally, on one third of the trials, participants were presented with a preventative sentence (e.g. Yesterday, Bill quit
smoking.). On one third of the trials, participants were presented with an enabling sentence (Yesterday, Bill bought a
pack of cigarettes.) The final third of trials had no additional
evidence and were identical to Expt. 2.
Only twenty-one of the original thirty-one items were used
in order to shorten the experiment. To increase expected variability, participants saw only the frequencies that led to most
intermediate endorsement of the habitual in Expt. 2. In ad-

dition, we did not include separate trials for both male and
female names for the select items we did in Expt. 2, since we
saw no differences in their endorsements of the habitual.
Participants were asked “In the next TIME WINDOW,
how many times do you think PERSON does EVENT?”,
where the TIME WINDOW was the same as given in the
past frequency statement. The experiment in full can be
viewed at http://stanford.edu/˜mtessler/habituals/
experiments/priors/predictive-1.html.

Behavioral results
Figure 3 (left) shows the predicted future frequency as a function of the past frequency given to the participant and the type
of causal information given. We observe in the baseline condition that future frequency perfectly tracks past frequency
(e.g. participants believe if a person smoked cigarettes 3
times last month, they will smoke cigarettes 3 times next
month). This means that our model makes identical predictions for Expt. 2 whether the target is past frequency or expected future frequency (indicating, as expected, that we must
look to the new data to distinguish these models). Critically,
we observe the preventative information appreciably decreasing and the enabling information slightly increasing predicted
frequency (Figure 3 left; blue and green dots).

Experiment 3b: Felicity judgments
Methods We recruited 150 participants from MTurk, using
the same criterion as Expt. 2. The experiment took 4 minutes
on average on participants were compensated $0.40 for their
work. None of the participants had completed Expt. 3a. The
only difference from Expt. 3a is the dependent measure.
On each trial, participants were asked if they agreed or
disagreed with the corresponding habitual sentence (as in
Expt. 2). The experiment in full can be viewed at http://
stanford.edu/˜mtessler/habituals/experiments/
truth-judgments/tj-3-preventative.html.

Results
There is a clear and consistent negative effect of preventative
information on endorsements for the habitual sentence (Figure 3, middle; blue points). When collapsing across items and
subjecting the data to a generalized mixed-effects model with
random by-participant effects of intercept and random byitem effects of intercept and conditions, we find evidence for
a small effect of enabling conditions on endorsements (M =
0.89; 95% Bootstrapped CI [0.88, 0.91]) as compared to baseline (M = 0.85 [0.83, 0.87]) [β = 0.42; SE = 0.15; z = 2.8],
and a large effect of preventative conditions on endorsements
(M = 0.29 [0.26, 0.31]) [β = −3.22; SE = 0.21; z = −15.2].
We use the mean predicted log frequency from Expt. 3a
as the input to the speaker S2 model to predict the felicity
judgments measured in Expt. 3b. We infer the two model
parameters using the same analysis approach in Expt. 2. The
model matches the data well (r2 (63) = 0.91; Figure 3, right).
The same model using the past frequency as the object of
communication does not match the data at all (r2 (63) = 0.02).
These results suggest that the felicity of habituals is based on
an underlying scale of predicted future propensity, not merely
the observed frequency in the past.
Interestingly, we observe endorsements in this experiment
that are appreciably higher than in Expt. 2 for the same items
(Figure 3, middle; red vs. purple points). This may be due, in
part, to an effect of the experimental context on participants:
in this experiment the overall population of frequencies is
much lower (both because we selected moderate frequencies
from Expt. 2 and because of the preventative information) and
participants may infer that the experimenter believes this to
be a representative range and adjust judgments accordingly.
Future investigation into this issue is warranted.

We presented a computational model for communicating generalizations about events. The model decides if a habitual
sentence is a pragmatically useful way to describe a person’s
behavior, taking into account the listener’s prior beliefs about
the action—how common it is and the likely frequency (measured in Expt. 1). We validated this model by eliciting felicity
judgments for habitual sentences covering diverse activities
with a wide range of experimentally manipulated frequencies
of action (Expt. 2). We further investigated the nature of the
underlying “propensity” scale by introducing enabling and
disabling evidence, measuring the predicted future frequency
(Expt. 3a) and using that, with the model, to predict the felicity of habitual sentences (Expt. 3b). To our knowledge, the
experiments presented here are first empirical investigations
into the truth conditions of habitual sentences and the first test
of a formal model of habitual language.
The model we present here is almost identical to a model
we have used to describe generic language (Tessler & Goodman, under review). The only difference is in the underlying scale: for generics, it is the prevalence of the property;
for habituals, the propensity of the action. This provides a

formal bridge between generalizations about categories (i.e.
generics) and generalizations about events (i.e. habituals), a
connection often noted in the linguistics literature (Carlson,
1977, 2005; Cohen, 1999). Generics often use a bare plural (e.g. Bears like to eat ants.) and don’t lay claim to any
well-defined set of individuals (many bears may not like to
eat ants). Habituals use the simple present tense (e.g. John
smokes) without any well-defined period of time (John may
go many days without smoking). In both cases, a pragmatically inferred threshold on prevalence or propensity, respectively, explains the varying truth conditions of these kinds of
sentences. Scales, and scalar representations, provide a simple and general quantitative way to express truth conditions.
Accurately predicting the environment is critical for survival and development. Habituals convey generalizations
about events and are helpful for future predictions about
events. For example, knowing that an event generally happens may be a useful abstraction for causal inference (e.g.
Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005). Generalizations about people’s behavior in particular—as we’ve investigated in this
article—are important to understand, as they likely facilitate
trait induction and essentialist beliefs (Gelman & Heyman,
1999). The computational model presented here provides a
mathematical bridge between the way we talk about people’s
behavior and our intuitive theories of others and events.
