Abstract
Given the global challenges of security, both in physical and
cyber worlds, security agencies must optimize the use of their
limited resources. To that end, many security agencies have
begun to use "security game" algorithms, which optimally plan
defender allocations, using models of adversary behavior that
have originated in behavioral game theory. To advance our
understanding of adversary behavior, this paper presents
results from a study involving an opportunistic crime security
game (OSG), where human participants play as opportunistic
adversaries against an algorithm that optimizes defender
allocations. In contrast with previous work which often
assumes homogeneous adversarial behavior, our work
demonstrates that participants are naturally grouped into
multiple distinct categories that share similar behaviors. We
capture the observed adversarial behaviors in a set of diverse
models from different research traditions, behavioral game
theory, and Cognitive Science, illustrating the need for
heterogeneity in adversarial models.

Introduction
Given the global challenges of security, optimizing the use
of limited resources to protect a set of targets from an
adversary has become a crucial challenge. In terms of
physical security, the challenges include optimizing security
resources for patrolling major airports or ports, screening
passengers and cargo, scheduling police patrols to counter
urban crime (Tambe 2011; Pita et al., 2008; Shieh et al.,
2012). The challenge of security resource optimization
carries over to cybersecurity (Gonzalez, Ben-Asher,
Oltramari & Lebiere, 2015), where it is important to assist
human administrators in defending networks from attacks.
In order to build effective defense strategies, we need to
understand and model adversary behavior and defenderadversary interactions. For this purpose, researchers have
relied on the insights from Stackelberg Security Games
(SSGs) to provide ways to optimize defense strategies
(Korzyk, Conitzer, & Parr, 2010; Tambe, 2011). SSGs model
the interaction between a defender and an adversary as a
leader-follower game (Tambe 2011). A defender plays a
particular defense strategy (e.g., randomized patrolling of
airport terminals) and then the adversary takes an action after
having observed the defender’s strategy. Past SSG research
often assumed a perfectly rational adversary in computing the
optimal defense (mixed or randomized) strategy. Realizing
the limitation of this assumption, recent SSG work has
focused on bounded rationality models from behavioral game

theory, such as the Quantal Response behavior model
(McFadden 1976, Camerer 2003), but typically a
homogeneous adversary population is assumed, and a single
adversary behavior model is prescribed (Kar et al., 2015).
In contrast to this previous work which often assumes a
homogeneous adversary population with a single behavioral
model, this paper focuses on the heterogeneity in adversary
behavior. Our results are based on the study conducted in
Opportunistic Security Games (OSGs). In that experiment,
(Abbasi et al., 2015) evaluated behavioral game theory
models assuming a homogeneous adversary population.
However, our results show that adversaries can be naturally
categorized into distinct groups based on their attack patterns.
For instance, while one group of participants (about 20% of
the population) is seen to be highly rational and taking reward
maximizing action, another group (nearly 50%) is seen to act
in a completely random fashion. We show through
experiments that considering distinct groups of adversaries
leads to interesting insights about their behavioral model,
including the defender strategies being generated based on
the learned model.
There are two strands of previous work related to this
paper. First, in behavioral game theory models in security
games, mostly homogenous adversary models have been
studied, but some recent research has considered the
heterogeneity of human adversarial behavior. They have
achieved it by either assuming a smooth distribution of the
model parameters for the entire adversary population (Yang
et al., 2014), such as a normal distribution or by utilizing a
single behavioral model for each adversary (Haskell et al.,
2014; Yang et al., 2014). However, they have not categorized
the adversaries into distinct groups based on their attack
patterns. In this paper, we show that adversaries can be
categorized into multiple distinct groups, and each such
group can be represented by distinct degrees of rationality.
The second strand of related work is with respect to the
exploration of available options, which is an important aspect
of decision making in many naturalistic situations (Pirolli &
Card, 1999; Todd, Penke, Fasolo, & Lenton, 2007; Gonzalez
& Dutt, 2011). In line with previous work (Hills & Hertwig,
2010; Gonzalez & Dutt, 2012), in this paper, we show that
there is a negative relationship between exploration behavior
and maximization of rewards. However, in their work, they
did not contrast behavioral models with cognitive models and
did not provide insights for behavioral game theory models
which we provide. In particular, we study the relationship
between exploration and human reward maximization
behavior by parameters of bounded rationality models of

1391

human adversaries. Our observations are also with respect to
the security games domain where this kind of relationship
between exploration behavior and maximization of rewards
has not been studied before. Furthermore, in our work
participants were shown all relevant information, such as
rewards about all the alternative choices, while in earlier
work participants had to explore and collect information
about various alternatives.
To model the different categories of human behavior, we
provide a family of behavioral game theory and cognitive
models. In behavioral game theory models, we have explored
models such as the popular Quantal Response (McKelvey &
Palfrey 1995) and the Subjective Utility Quantal Response
models (Nguyen et al., 2013). These models have been shown
to successfully capture human rationality in decision making
in the security games domain (Tambe, 2011). In addition,
based on the tradition of Cognitive Science, we use a model
derived from a well-known cognitive theory, the InstanceBased Learning Theory (IBLT) (Gonzalez, Lerch, & Lebiere,
2003), developed to explain human decision making behavior
in dynamic tasks and used to detect adversarial behaviors
(Ben-Asher, Oltramari, Erbacher & Gonzalez, 2015). This is
the first such use of cognitive models in security games. In
summary, in this paper we build on the existent literature of
security games and adversary behavior modeling by: (i)
investigating the heterogeneity of adversarial behavior in an
experimental study designed for OSGs, by categorizing
adversaries into groups based on their exploration patterns;
(ii) comparing computational models and showing the impact
of heterogeneity on future behavior prediction; and (iii)
showing the impact of considering heterogeneity on the
defender strategies generated.

A behavioral study in an OSG
To collect data regarding adversarial behavior from playing
an OSG repeatedly, we used data collected from experiments
by (Abbasi et al., 2015) using a simulation of urban crime in
a metro transportation system with six stations (Figure 1).

Methods
Game Design. The players’ goal is to maximize their score
by collecting rewards (represented by stars in Figure 1) while
avoiding officers on patrol. Each player can travel to any
station, including the current one, by train as represented by
the dashed lines in Figure 1.

There are two moving officers, each protecting three
stations. The probability of their presence at each station or
route, i.e. patrolling strategy, is determined beforehand using
an optimization algorithm similar to the one presented in
(Zhang et al., 2014). The algorithm optimizes defender
strategies given an opportunistic adversary behavior model.
The stationary coverage probabilities for each station and
trains are revealed to the players. This means that players can
see the percentage of the time that officers spend on average
at each station and on the train, so they can determine the
chance of encountering an officer at a station. However,
during the game, the players cannot observe where officers
are actually located unless they encounter the officer at a
station.
The game can finish either if the player uses up all the 100
units of available time in each game, or the game is randomly
terminated after a station visit, which may happen with a 10%
probability after each station visit. The random termination
encourages players to choose each action carefully, as there
is a chance the game may terminate after each visit.
The player’s objective is to maximize his total reward in
limited time. Players must carefully choose which stations to
visit, considering the available information about rewards,
officers’ coverage distribution on stations and time to visit
the station.
Procedures. Each participant played eight games in total;
starting with two practice rounds to become familiar with the
game, followed by two validation rounds (two simple
versions of the main games), in which the participants were
presented with obvious choices to confirm they understood
the rules and game’s objective, and finally, four main games
from which we collect and use the data for our analyses. To
ensure that the collected data is independent of the graph
structure, the four main games were played on four different
graphs, presented in a random order to the participants. Each
graph had six stations with a different route structure and
patrolling strategy.
Participants. The participants were recruited from
Amazon Mechanical Turk. They were eligible if they had
previously played more than 500 games and had an
acceptance rate of minimum 95%. To motivate the subjects
to participate in the study, they were rewarded based on their
total score ($0.01 for each gained point) in addition to a base
compensation ($1). In total, 70 participants took part in the

Using data from all the main games, Figure 2 illustrates the
distribution of attacks (i.e., moves) from all participants
(black bars) on stations ranked by the participants’ expected
utility (average earning per time) 1, as well as attacks of five
randomly selected individuals (P1 to P5). To normalize the
utility scores among graphs, we have used the ranking of
stations’ utility (utility rank) instead of its absolute value (the
highest utility in a graph is ranked 1). The graph illustrates
significant heterogeneity behavior among individuals (line
charts), and comparison to the average behavior (bar chart).
Given this heterogeneous behavior, we have applied the
Hierarchical Clustering algorithm (Johnson, 1967) on
different features related to an individuals’ exploration
behavior and found that mobility score was the best feature to
cluster the participants. The mobility score is a measure of
exploration: it is a ratio of the number of movements between
stations over the number of trials (total number of
movements) by a participant in the game. Figure 5: % of
participants based on the Mobility Score
shows the distribution of participants based on their
mobility score for each graph. The mobility score varied
widely (0% to 100%) with a significant proportion of
participants at the two extremes. Informally, the exploration
behavior seems to fall into three categories: (i) those who did
no exploration; (ii) those who always explored and (iii) those
who engaged in a middling level of exploration. Indeed, the
clustering algorithm resulted in three groups of participants:
participants whose mobility score is less than 10% belong to
Cluster1, participants with 10% to 80% mobility score belong
to Cluster2, and participants whose mobility score is greater
than 80% belong to Cluster3.

Figure 3 shows the percentage of participants belonging to

The percentage of participants belonging to each cluster is
nearly consistent across all graphs: approximately, 20% in
Cluster1, 30% in Cluster2 and 50% in Cluster3.
In Figure 4, using the data from all the graphs per cluster,
we show the distribution of utility ranks for each of the three
clusters. Interestingly, mobility scores were highly correlated
with the utility ranks of the attacked stations (𝑅2 = .85 & 𝑝 <
.01). We observe that participants in Cluster1 (the lowest
mobility scores), attacked stations with the highest utility
(average utility rank of 1.04). In contrast, participants in
Cluster3 (the highest mobility score), attacked stations that
varied more widely in the utility rank (average utility rank of
3.3). Participants in Cluster2 also attacked a variety of
stations but were leaning (on average) towards higher utility
rank stations (average utility rank of 1.7). These observations
provide interesting insights for building defender strategies,
as illustrated in Section Model Results.

Models of Adversarial Behavior in OSG
In what follows, we present a series of models that have been
proposed recently to represent adversarial behavior.

Quantal Response Model (QR)
Quantal Response models the bounded rationality of a human
player by capturing the uncertainty in the decisions made by
the player (McKelvey & Palfrey 1995; McFadden 1976).
Instead of maximizing the expected utility, QR posits that the
decision-making agent chooses an action that gives high
expected utility, with probability higher than another action
which gives a lower expected utility. In the context of OSG,
given the defender’s strategy 𝑠 (e.g., stationary coverage
probability at station 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖 ) shown in Figure 1), the probability
of the adversary choosing to attack target 𝑖 when he is in
target 𝑗 and when the defender’s coverage is 𝑠, 𝑞𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠), is
given by the following equation:
𝑒 𝜆 ∗ 𝐸𝑈𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠)
𝑞𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠) =
∑1≤𝑘≤6 𝑒 𝜆 ∗ 𝐸𝑈(𝑘,𝑗)(𝑠)
where 𝜆 is his degree of rationality and 𝐸𝑈𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠) is the
expected utility of the adversary as given by:
𝑟𝑖
𝐸𝑈𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠) =
∗ (1 − 𝑠𝑖 )
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 (𝑖, 𝑗)

𝐸𝑈 = (1 − 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒) ∗ 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑/ 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒

1393

where 𝑟𝑖 is the number of stars at station 𝑖, 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 (𝑖, 𝑗) refers
to time taken to attack station 𝑖 when player is in station 𝑗

Subjective Utility Quantal Response (SUQR)
The SUQR model combines two key notions of decision
making: Subjective Expected Utility, SEU, (Fischhoff et al.,
1981) and Quantal Response; it essentially replaces the
expected utility function in QR with the SEU function
(Nguyen et al., 2013). In this model, the probability that the
adversary chooses station 𝑖 when he is at station j, when the
defender’s coverage is 𝑠, is given by 𝑞𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠). 𝑆𝐸𝑈𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠) is a
linear combination of three key factors. The key factors are
(a) 𝑟𝑖 , (b) 𝑠𝑖 , and (c) 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑤 = <𝑤𝑟 , 𝑤𝑠𝑡𝑎 , 𝑤𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 > denotes
the weights for each decision making feature:
𝑞𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠) =

𝑒

𝑆𝐸𝑈𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠)

∑𝑡′∈𝑇 𝑒 𝑆𝐸𝑈𝑖,𝑡 (𝑆)

where

𝑆𝐸𝑈𝑖,𝑗 (𝑠) = 𝑤𝑟 . 𝑟𝑖 + 𝑤𝑠𝑡𝑎 . 𝑠𝑖 + 𝑤𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 . 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑖,𝑗

Instance-Based Learning Model
The IBL model of an adversary in the OSG makes a choice
about the station to go to, by first applying a randomization
rule at each time step:
If draw form U(0,1) >= Satisficing threshold
Make a random choice
Else;
Make a choice with the highest Blended value.
This rule aims at separating highly exploratory choices
from those made by the satisficing mechanism of the IBL, the
Blended Value. Satisficing is a parameter of this model. The
Blended value V represents value of attacking each station
(option j ):
𝑛

𝑉𝑗 = ∑ 𝑝𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑖𝑗
𝑖=1

where 𝑥𝑖𝑗 refers to the value (payoff) of each station (the
number of stars divided by time taken) stored in memory as
instance i for the station j, and 𝑝𝑖𝑗 is the probability of
retrieving that instance for blending from memory (Gonzalez
& Dutt, 2011; Lejarraga et al., 2012) defined as:
𝐴𝑖

and more recently. For example, if an unguarded nearby
station with many starts (reward) is observed many times, the
activation of this instance will increase, and the probability
of selecting that station in the next round will be higher.
However, if this instance is not observed often, the memory
of such station will decay with the passage of time (the
parameter d, the decay, is a non-negative free parameter that
defines the rate of forgetting). The noise component  is a
free parameter that reflects noisy memory retrieval.

Model Results
We aggregated the human data and divided the data set into
two groups: training and test datasets. The data from the first
three graphs played by the participants were used for training
and the last graph played was used for testing the models.
This resulted in 1322 instances in the training set and 500
instances in the test data set.
For comparison of different models, we use Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) and Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) metrics. RMSE represents the deviation between
model’s predicted probability of adversary’s attack (𝑝̂ ) and
the actual proportion of attacks of participants from each
station to others (p).

𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸(𝑝̂ ) =√𝑀𝑆𝐸(𝑝̂ ) where MSE (𝑝̂ ) = ∑(𝑝̂ − 𝑝)
𝑛
AIC provides a measure of the relative quality of statistical
models; the lower the value, the better the model. The metric
rewards goodness of fit (as assessed by the likelihood
function), and penalizes overfitting (based on a number of
estimation parameters).

Table 1 shows the results on the full data set. The model
parameters obtained from the training data set were used to
make predictions on the test dataset. The prediction errors
from all the models are relatively similar, even though they
provide different perspectives. QR and SUQR predict the
stable state transition probabilities of the attacker while the
IBL is a process model that captures learning and decision
dynamics over time. We also examine the parameter values
and performance of the models for each cluster (Table 2).

where 𝑙 refers to the total number of payoffs observed for

information is in memory:

The value of λ (higher value of λ corresponds to higher

from Cluster1 (high value of λ=1.81) to Cluster3 (λ=0). These
findings are consistent with our observation of the utility

The results from the IBL model suggest that the categories
of adversaries found in this study do not emerge naturally
from the learning process. Indeed, in this study participants
had little opportunities to learn. Instead, it appears that
participants either use the information readily available to
them in the OSG and attempt to maximize their gains, or they
explore the choices randomly which may lead them to less
optimal decisions. These two modes of behavior were

captured in the IBL model by a meta-rule with a Satisficing
parameter. This meta-rule is not part of the IBL model, but it
helps to overpass the natural choice by Blending (similar to
the Inertia meta-rule used in Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011). This
meta-rule was added to explicitly account for random
exploratory behavior observed in the OSG. Therefore, the
Satisficing parameter helps in selecting between the two
modes of behavior to form the different clusters. The
Satisficing parameter is highest in Cluster1, lower in
Cluster2, and lowest in Cluster3. Cluster1 results from most
choices being made by the IBL’s Blending while Cluster3
results from a random choice. However, this parameter
interacts with the IBL model’s decay and noise parameters.
For example, in Cluster1, most decisions are made for the
station with highest Blended value, and there is a need for a
high noise value to introduce the variability found in human
behavior. In contrast, choices in Cluster3 are mostly done
randomly, but in the rare occasions when the model makes
choices based on the highest Blended value, it attempts to
benefit from recent past experiences (i.e., low decay) and
with low noise to the decision processes. Therefore,
identifying such meta-rules for accounting for explicit
descriptive information in addition to the IBL model’s
learning mechanisms is an important aspect of capturing
adversary behavior in security games.
It is interesting to observe that the behavioral game theory
models provide a significantly better fit in Cluster1,
compared to the IBL cognitive model, while the values of
behavioral game theory models are comparable to those of
the IBL model in Clusters 2 and 3. The IBL model, being a
learning model, is poor at making highly accurate decisions
with little or no experience as in the OSG study.
Finally, to demonstrate the impact of considering distinct
heterogeneous groups of adversaries, we consider one of the
most recent works (Kar et al., 2015) which advocated the use
of a homogeneous adversary model. We show on data
collected from their domain that there is a significant
difference between the defender strategies generated by a
homogeneous (SUQR) and a heterogeneous model which
considers three distinct clusters (Bayesian SUQR). The bar
charts in Figure 6 shows the percentage of change in defender
strategy, for example, for target 16, the change in coverage
probability from defender strategy generated against a
homogeneous to that against a heterogeneous model is 110%.

ranks of targets chosen by adversaries in each cluster, as
shown in Figure 5. This is significant because past research
has assumed that all participants either behave based on an
average value of λ or that each individual's value of λ can be
sampled from a smooth distribution. In this study, however,
we show that a significant number of participants (70%: 20%
in Cluster1 plus 50% in Cluster3) have values of λ which fall
at two extreme ends of the spectrum, thus modeling perfectly
rational and completely random adversaries respectively.
Moreover, considering the fact that SUQR weights indicate
the importance of each attribute to the decision maker, the
results of SUQR parameter extraction for different clusters
reveal some interesting points. First, the fact that Cluster1 has
the largest weights for all attributes (in the absolute terms)
implies that Cluster1 participants are very attracted to the
stations with high rewards and highly repelled by high
defender coverage; which conforms with the observed
behavior of Cluster1 participants in maximizing the expected
utility. Second, although SUQR outperforms QR overall and
in Cluster2 and 3, QR has lower prediction error (statistically
significant for paired t-test at t (288) = 02.34, p<0.01) on data
for Cluster1. This is intuitive if participants are utility
maximizers, this would be captured better when in the QR
model. On the other hand, a model like SUQR, which reasons
based on different features of the game capture better the
propensity of the participants to switch between stations, and
hence perform better on Clusters 2 and three where
participants do not have a clear movement pattern. Therefore,
identifying different groups of adversaries gives us valuable
insight into the types of behavioral models that can be used
in different scenarios to generate accurate future predictions

Conclusions
Significant research has been conducted towards
understanding adversary behavior in security games, which
has led to several deployed real-world applications (Tambe
2011), such as PROTECT for the protection of major ports in

1395

the US (Shieh et al. 2012) and ARMOR for scheduling of
police patrols at major airports such as LAX (Pita et al. 2008).
Although researchers in security games have relied on
modeling adversaries via a single homogeneous model, or a
heterogeneous model with a smooth distribution over model
parameters, in this paper, we showed the heterogeneity in
adversary behavior by clustering adversaries into distinct
groups based on their exploration patterns. Three clusters
emerged based on the adversaries’ exploration patterns, two
of which fall at two extreme ends of the parameter spectrum,
capturing perfectly rational and completely random behavior.
We also observed that in our OSG domain, exploration is
negatively correlated with utility maximization.
We demonstrate that accounting for the diversity of
adversary behavior leads to different model parameters and
can provide more accurate predictions of future behavior.
Specifically, we show on data collected based on an
Opportunistic Security Game that: (i) QR captures the
behavior of utility maximizing adversaries much better than
SUQR or IBL based models; (ii) the behavioral and cognitive
models have similar prediction performance for adversaries
who do not act in a perfectly rational fashion. Furthermore,
we show that considering the heterogeneity in adversary
behavior leads to different defender strategies being
generated. The effectiveness of such strategies is an
important area of future work.
