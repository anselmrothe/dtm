account claims that conjunctive representations in MTL are
important whenever a cognitive task – perceptual or mnemonic – uses stimuli with overlapping features, such that individual feature representations in posterior regions provide
ambiguous information (Bussey & Saksida, 2002).

Abstract
Damage to the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) impairs declarative memory and perception. The Representational-Hierarchical (RH) Account explains such impairments by assuming
that MTL stores conjunctive representations of items and
events, and that individuals with MTL damage must rely upon
representations of simple visual features in posterior visual
cortex. A recent study revealed a surprising anti-perceptual
learning effect in MTL-damaged individuals: with exposure to
a set of visual stimuli, discrimination performance worsened
rather than improved. We expand the RH account to explain
this paradox by assuming that visual discrimination is performed using a familiarity heuristic. Exposure to a set of highly
similar stimuli entails repeated presentation of simple visual
features, eventually rendering all feature representations
equally (maximally) familiar and hence inutile for solving the
task. Since the unique conjunctions represented in MTL do not
occur repeatedly, healthy individuals are shielded from this
perceptual interference. We simulate this mechanism with a
neural network previously used to simulate recognition
memory, thereby providing a model that accounts for both
mnemonic and perceptual deficits caused by MTL damage using a unified architecture and mechanism.

Paradoxical Finding of an Exposure-induced Deficit in
Visual Discrimination Performance Barense et al. (2012)
documented a new and puzzling way in which MTL lesions
impair visual discrimination. MTL amnesics and healthy controls were asked to judge whether pairs of simultaneously
presented abstract stimuli were the same or different (Fig. 1).
In the High Ambiguity condition, each pair of to-be-discriminated stimuli shared 2 out of 3 explicitly defined features,
whereas in the Low Ambiguity condition, the items in a pair
did not share any of the defined features. Participants were to
declare ‘mismatch’ if any of the 3 features differed in a pair.
Amnesic participants were unimpaired at discriminating Low
Ambiguity objects, but discrimination of High Ambiguity objects deteriorated dramatically in the second half of trials in
this condition (Fig. 2).

Introduction
Revisiting the Classical, Modular Account of Memory
and Perception Long-term, declarative memory has long
been known to depend on medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures (Scoville & Milner, 1957; Squire & Zola-Morgan,
1991). However, evidence now suggests an additional role
for MTL in other cognitive functions such as visual perception of objects and scenes (Barense et al., 2012; Bartko, et al.,
2007; Lee et al., 2005).
A theory termed the Representational Hierarchical (RH)
account explains both mnemonic and perceptual deficits
caused by MTL damage (Bussey & Saksida, 2002; Cowell,
Bussey, & Saksida, 2006, 2010). The RH account assumes
that the ventral visual stream contains a hierarchical organization of representations that continues into MTL. Early
stages of the pathway (e.g., V1, V2, V4) are assumed to represent simple visual features (e.g., color, orientation), and
these simple features are brought together into conjunctions
of increasing complexity in anterior brain regions. The hierarchy culminates in MTL where the conjunctions correspond
to whole objects, scenes, or complex episodic events. The RH

Figure 1: Experiment 3 of Barense et al. (2012). Stimuli
were defined by 3 features: inner shape, outer shape, and fill
pattern. High Ambiguity, mis-matching pairs shared 2 of
these features, but Low Ambiguity pairs share 0.
Barense et al. explained their data in terms of the RH account: Individuals with MTL damage lack conjunctive representations of objects usually stored in perirhinal cortex
(PRC), a structure in MTL. Objects are instead represented as
individual simple features in posterior visual cortex. In the
task of Barense et al., each stimulus is a unique conjunction
of features, but the features comprising the stimuli repeat often over trials. After viewing many items, feature-level interference renders feature representations in posterior visual

pants did not discriminate stimuli based on their representational overlap, but instead used a familiarity heuristic to decide whether two items were identical (Goldstein &
Gigerenzer, 2002).

Figure 2: Data from Barense et al. (2012). Subjects with
perirhinal (PRC) lesions were impaired at discriminating

participant separately (Control n=8; Lesion n=2).
cortex inadequate for solving difficult (High Ambiguity) discriminations. Control subjects resolve this interference with
a unique conjunction in PRC for each stimulus, but if PRC is
damaged, performance is impaired.
However, the decrease in MTL amnesics’ performance
with increasing exposure to the stimuli contrasts with wellestablished perceptual learning effects. Perceptual learning is
usually explained by assuming that experience increases the
separability of stimuli, either because stimulus representations become less overlapping (Saksida, 1999; Schoups,
Vogels, Qian, & Orban, 2001; Yang & Maunsell, 2004), or
because the weights via which representations influence decision-making are optimized (Kumano & Uka, 2013; Liu,
Dosher, & Lu, 2015). But if discrimination relies on the separability of stimulus representations, and exposure differentiates representations, then damage to the brain areas containing those representations might be expected to abolish any
improvements conferred by exposure, but it is not clear why
brain damage should cause exposure to hurt performance. Put
another way, even if individuals with MTL damage possess
only feature representations, it is not apparent why exposure
should cause feature representations to become more overlapping, rather than less.
How can this contradiction be resolved? In a previous
neural network instantiation of the RH account (Cowell et al.,
2006) we accounted for impairments in recognition memory
induced by MTL damage by considering the familiarity signal evoked by stimulus representations in the brain. Exposure
to many items sharing visual features entails frequent repetition of the features. Eventually, the representations of all features in posterior visual cortex appear familiar, causing individuals with MTL damage (who possess only feature representations) to perceive all items as equally familiar, impairing
recognition memory. This surprising mechanism has been
empirically supported (e.g, McTighe, et al., 2010). Here, we
invoke the same mechanism to explain the visual discrimination impairments reported by Barense et al. To apply this account to visual discrimination, we make an assumption about
the strategy used to solve the task: we propose that partici-

A Familiarity Heuristic Resolves the Paradox of Exposure-induced Discrimination Impairments We assume
that, in difficult discrimination tasks like that of Barense et
al. (2012), participants search for a mismatch between two
stimuli. To do so, they visually scan back and forth between
the stimuli; if switching from one item to the other elicits an
impression of novelty relative to the item just examined, this
is taken as evidence for a mismatch. That is, the new item
appears "unfamiliar" to the extent that it differs from the item
inspected immediately before switching. If switching elicits
a decrease in familiarity that exceeds some threshold, the two
stimuli are judged to mismatch. Hence, the model’s signal for
familiarity – the 'tunedness' of the stimulus representations
(Cowell et al., 2006) – can be used to perform discrimination.
Just as in the memory simulations of Cowell et al. (2006),
representations in the model can ‘saturate’ (i.e., reach maximum) in terms of familiarity. In a discrimination task in
which all stimuli are similar, the stimulus features appear repeatedly, resulting in all feature representations becoming
highly tuned, i.e., familiar. After sufficient interference, all
feature representations possess the same, maximum, level of
familiarity and can no longer be used to discriminate two objects via a familiarity heuristic. In contrast, because individual objects do not repeat across trials, familiarity for whole
objects does not saturate and so remains useful for discrimination: conjunctive representations in PRC shield a person
from perceptual interference. When these conjunctive representations are compromised by MTL damage, visual discrimination is impaired. A key tenet of the RH account is that
memory and perception share common neural mechanisms.
Our model embodies this by using a mnemonic signal (familiarity) to solve a visual perceptual task.

Description of the Model
Model Architecture We use the model of Cowell et al.
(2006) with only minor modifications. The network contains
a PRC layer and a layer corresponding to posterior ventral
visual stream (Fig. 3). Visual objects are instantiated as 8dimensional vectors, given as input to the model. We assume
that posterior regions represent simple conjunctions of two
individual visual dimensions, so the Posterior layer is divided
into 4 grids: nodes in each posterior grid receive 2 input dimensions and combine them into a simple conjunction,
termed a ‘feature’. In contrast, because PRC is assumed to
represent whole objects, all 8 input dimensions converge into
a single conjunction in the PRC layer. Thus, nodes in the PRC
layer contain a unique, conjunctive representation of a fourfeatured object, whereas the Posterior layer represents those
four, 2-dimensional features separately. We simulate PRC
damage by removing the PRC layer.

rate decreases as 𝜂𝜂(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑡𝑡 −𝐴𝐴 , where the constant 𝐴𝐴 determines the rate of decrease.
In each pre-training cycle, the network sees a different,
unique stimulus. For simulations of the Barense et al. (2012)
experiments, 𝜂𝜂 and 𝐺𝐺 are constants fixed at the values of the
final training cycle (𝜂𝜂 = 𝜂𝜂(500); 𝐺𝐺 = 𝐺𝐺(500)).

Measuring Familiarity Activation (a) of nodes was determined by the sigmoidal function:
(4)
𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 = 1�

�1 + exp �−𝑘𝑘 ∗ ln � ���
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

Figure 3: Model architecture. The PRC layer is a single
Kohonen grid, representing an object as a unique conjunction. The Posterior layer contains 4 Kohonen grids, each
representing a 2-dimensional visual ‘feature’.
All model layers are constructed from Kohonen grids,
which mimic properties of cortex, including information processing mechanisms such as Hebbian learning and lateral inhibition (Kohonen, 1984). A Kohonen grid (or self-organizing map) is trained by successively presenting stimulus inputs
and incrementally adapting the weights of the grid units on
each presentation. As the grid learns, its stimulus representations are sharpened or ‘tuned’: A novel stimulus elicits a
broadly distributed pattern of activity, whereas a stimulus that
has been repeatedly presented elicits a highly selective activation pattern with a peak over one set of units, relative to the
activation levels elsewhere across the grid. In our model, the
selectivity of the activation indexes familiarity (Cowell et al.,
2006; Norman & O’Reilly, 2003).
Each dimension of an input stimulus can take one of four
values in a given stimulus: 0.05, 035, 0.65, or 0.95. This
scheme yields 48 = 65,536 unique object stimuli, which are
represented holistically on the PRC layer, but only 42 = 16
unique, 2-dimensional features on each Posterior grid. This
scheme reflects a key assumption of the model: that there is
a vast number of possible visual objects in the world, but they
are composed from a small number of visual elements.
Initialization and Pretraining All grids contained 200𝑥𝑥200
nodes whose weights were initialized with random values between 0 and 1. Networks were pre-trained for 500 cycles according to the standard Kohonen learning rule,
and,

𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡 + 1) = 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝑓𝑓(𝑟𝑟, 𝑡𝑡) ∗ (𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 − 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡)) (1)
𝑓𝑓(𝑟𝑟, 𝑡𝑡) = 𝜂𝜂(𝑡𝑡) ∗ 𝑣𝑣(𝑟𝑟, 𝑡𝑡),

(2)

where 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 refers to the weights of node 𝑖𝑖, t is the current cycle,
stim is stimulus input, 𝜂𝜂(𝑡𝑡) is the learning-rate, 𝑟𝑟 is the cityblock distance of node i from the most strongly active (winning) node, and 𝑣𝑣(𝑟𝑟, 𝑡𝑡) is a neighborhood function that scales
the learning rate (Eq. 3).
In the pre-training phase, both 𝜂𝜂 and 𝑣𝑣 decrease with each
cycle. The neighborhood is defined by a Gaussian function:
𝑟𝑟
𝑣𝑣(𝑟𝑟, 𝑡𝑡) = exp �−( )2 �
(3)
𝐺𝐺(𝑡𝑡)

where, G(t) = 0.5 + 10 t-B, and B is a constant determining the
rate of shrinkage of the neighborhood function. The learning

where 𝑘𝑘 is a constant that determines the steepness of the sigmoidal function, 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is the mean squared error between a
node’s weights (𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 ) and the stimulus input vector.
The familiarity of a stimulus is given by the selectivity of
its activation pattern, calculated separately in each grid. Selectivity is the activation of the peak (the summed activation
of the winning node and its nearest 4 neighbors) divided by
the summed total activation of the grid. Thus, via normalization, higher familiarity corresponds to more ‘tuned’ representations. Stimulus familiarity is measured separately in each
grid in the network, yielding a single, object-level familiarity
score from the PRC layer and four separate feature-level familiarity scores in the posterior layer; when comparing two
stimuli, the posterior feature-level familiarity scores are compared separately for each pair of features. For Control networks, this includes 4 Posterior grids and 1 PRC grid; for Lesioned networks, only 4 Posterior grids. In all simulations, 𝑘𝑘 = 0.08, 𝐵𝐵 = 0.3, and 𝐴𝐴 = 0.6.

Simulating Visual Discrimination Behavior

Fixations In Barense et al. (2012), participants decided
whether two stimuli were the same or different. Eye-tracking
data from control subjects revealed a higher ratio of withinstimulus to between-stimulus fixations in High Ambiguity
trials (~1.2) than in Low Ambiguity trials (~0.6). Barense et
al. conjectured that this reflected a greater tendency to 'bind'
features together in the High Ambiguity condition. Accordingly, we hypothesized that differential fixation ratios might
make an important contribution to task performance (e.g.,
sampling stimuli with a higher within: between ratio may enable more reliable PRC representations) and aligned model
parameters with these empirical data. In addition, on trials
declared as a ‘match’, participants made about 25 and 20 fixations for High and Low Ambiguity, respectively.
In the model, one stimulus fixation entails 20 encoding cycles (Eq. 1). Stimuli are 'sampled' via fixations, using a probabilistic rule for switching back and forth between two items
in a pair, with switch probability derived from the empirical
within:between ratio for each experimental condition (1.2 or
0.6). On any trial, the maximum number of fixations (i.e., the
point at which the search for a mismatch terminates and a
‘match’ is declared, see below) is 25 and 20 in the High and
Low Ambiguity conditions, respectively (since the stopping
point is somewhat arbitrary and not specified by our theory,
we used empirical parameters to determine this).

2089

Discrimination Decisions On each trial, two stimuli are presented. One is arbitrarily selected first (Item A) and the model
samples it via successive fixations until switching to the other
stimulus, Item B. Upon switching, the model assesses evidence for a 'mismatch' by computing a novelty score and
comparing it to a threshold. The novelty score is a measure
of 'familiarity change' obtained by taking the familiarity of
Item A and subtracting the familiarity of the Item B. When
the two items are identical, the novelty score is zero; when
they are different, Item B should have slightly lower familiarity than Item A, yielding a positive novelty score. If the
novelty score in any individual grid (4 Posterior grids or,
when available, PRC) exceeds the threshold, the items are declared to 'mismatch'. At each switch between the two stimuli,
if the network finds no evidence for a mismatch, the network
continues fixating. In the next comparison, Item B serves as
the previously inspected stimulus and Item A as the newly
fixated stimulus. Comparisons proceed until either a mismatch is declared or the maximum number of fixations is
reached, whereupon a ‘match’ is declared.
Criterion shift We assume that participants adjust their decision rule as their stimulus representations adapt. That is, if
participants begin to perceive all items as looking more similar, they require less evidence to declare that two items are
mismatching. To effect this, the threshold value of novelty
required to declare a pair of items as mismatching (i.e., the
decision criterion) is allowed to shift by setting it equal to the
average of the novelty ('familiarity change') score on the previous six trials. In addition, for each decision, noise drawn
from the uniform distribution (±1e-6) is added to the threshold. As familiarity change scores decrease, this noise swamps
the discrimination signal present in that score. The starting
threshold value (i.e., threshold on Trial 1) is set to 2x the maximum noise: 2e-6.

Simulation 1
Target Empirical Data In Experiment 3 of Barense et al.
(2012), participants indicated whether two simultaneously
presented visual stimuli were a match or a mismatch. Stimuli
were trial-unique items constructed of 3 features (Fig. 1). In
Low Ambiguity trials, the pairs shared none of these 3 features. In High Ambiguity trials, the items shared 2 out of 3
features. Individuals with PRC damage performed similarly
to controls at discriminating Low Ambiguity pairs, but for
High Ambiguity pairs their performance was intact at first but
fell sharply in the second half of the task (Fig. 2).
Stimuli and Task All stimuli were trial unique. Low Ambiguity stimulus pairs shared no 2-dimensional features,
whereas High Ambiguity pairs shared 3 out of 4 features (we
used 4 total features for consistency with Cowell et al., 2006).
Owing to assumptions governing stimulus construction (see
Model Architecture, above) there are many possible unique
stimuli, but the features comprising them appear repeatedly.
In addition, we further constrained the feature set to reflect

the high degree of feature-overlap in Barense et al. by constructing stimuli (unique 4-featured objects) using only 6 out
the 16 possible 2-dimensional features for each Posterior grid
(where a 'feature' is a conjunction of 2 input dimensions).
This yielded 64 total possible objects, with high feature-overlap among them. As in Barense et al., each condition contained 36 'match' and 36 'mismatch' trials.
Results Networks with no PRC layer ('PRC Lesion Group'),
like humans with PRC damage, were impaired relative to
controls at High but not Low Ambiguity. Critically, the impairment was worse in the second half of trials (Fig. 4). We
do not report statistics on simulated data because the results
are highly reliable such that variance scales arbitrarily with
the number of networks run. Instead, we focus on qualitative
patterns, which match those of the patient data: the interaction between Lesion Group, Stimulus Ambiguity and
First/Second Half.

Barense et al. (2012). Compare to the empirical data in Figure 2. n = 50 networks per group.
Simulation 1 Discussion The model’s simulation of a discrimination deficit for High Ambiguity stimuli in the second
half of trials, following PRC damage, hinges on three assumptions: (1) participants solve the task using a familiarity
heuristic; (2) task stimuli are unique but contain many lowlevel features that repeat over trials such that all features
eventually appear familiar; (3) stimuli are represented in PRC
as whole conjunctions but in posterior regions as individual
features: when PRC is missing, discrimination performance
is impaired once all features are maximally tuned.
Performance in lesioned networks relies upon posterior
feature representations. At the start of the task, individual features are not highly tuned. On each new trial, the features of
the first stimulus inspected increase in familiarity. When the
network switches to inspect the second stimulus, if that stimulus is not identical to the first, its features are lower in familiarity and a mismatch is correctly declared. However, after
many trials, all features have been repeatedly encoded by the
network. Now, at the start of a trial, there can be no increase
in familiarity when the network inspects the first stimulus.
When it switches to the second stimulus, even if that item
differs from the first, its features have equal familiarity – the
maximum value. At this point, a familiarity heuristic can no
longer detect mismatching stimulus pairs. The feature-level

2090

interference has more effect at High than Low Ambiguity because High Ambiguity pairs share 3 out of 4 features whereas
Low Ambiguity pairs share no features. Networks search for
any pair of features across the two stimuli that differ. Since
there are 4 mismatching features in Low pairs, the network is
more likely to discover at least 1 feature that has not yet
reached maximum familiarity.
Performance in control networks is maintained throughout
the task because of conjunctive representations in the PRC
layer. Individual stimuli are trial-unique, i.e., whole conjunctions are never repeated, so representations in PRC never
reach maximum familiarity. At the start of each new trial, the
PRC representation for the first stimulus inspected increases
in familiarity during the inspection. When the model switches
to inspect the second stimulus, if the second stimulus differs
from the first, the second will exhibit lower familiarity and
the pair will be declared to mismatch.

ing). In High Interference blocks the remaining 58 trials contained extra pairs of High Ambiguity objects. In Low Interference blocks the remaining 58 trials contained pairs of 'photo' stimuli. As in Barense et al., performance was judged on
critical trials, which occurred at every third position in the
sequence and contained a pair of stimuli sharing many (3 out
of 4) features. The difference between High and Low Interference was that, for Low, the trials interposed between critical trials contained items sharing no features with criticaltrial stimuli whereas, for High, interposed trials contained
items similar to critical-trial stimuli.
Results Networks with no PRC layer were able to discriminate at the level of Control networks in Low Interference
blocks (the first and third blocks), but their performance was
impaired in High Interference (second) block (Fig. 6), mirroring the results of Barense et al. (2012).

Simulation 2
Target Empirical Data In Experiment 4 of Barense et al.
(2012), all subjects completed 3 blocks: Low Interference,
then High Interference, then a second Low Interference
block. High Interference was the same as High Ambiguity in
Experiment 3: pairs of abstract stimuli shared 2 out of 3 features. In Low Interference blocks, two-thirds of trials contained a pair of color photographs of real-world objects.
Photo images were trial unique and shared few low-level features with the abstract stimuli of critical comparison trials
(Fig. 5). Experiment 4 replicated the result of Experiment 3:
MTL-damaged patients showed impaired discrimination at
High Interference, but not at Low Interference, even in block
3 of the test session (Fig. 6, left). This suggested that the impairment seen in Experiment 3 was not due to fatigue.

Figure 6: Experiment 4 of Barense et al. (2012). Low Interference blocks used photo stimuli in 2/3 of trials, which
shared few features with stimuli on critical comparison trials.
Stimuli and Task As in Simulation 1, abstract stimuli were
modeled by using only 6 of the 16 possible stimulus features
on each Posterior grid to construct four-featured stimulus
wholes, yielding high feature-overlap among stimuli. To reflect the assumption of Barense et al. that abstract stimuli
shared no 2-dimensional features with photo stimuli, we constructed photo stimulus inputs from the remaining 10 abstract
features (i.e., a non-overlapping set of features).
Networks performed 3 discrimination blocks. A block contained 88 trials, in which every third trial was a critical comparison pair of abstract stimuli (15 matching, 15 mismatch-

and model simulations (right). n = 50 networks per group.
Simulation 2 Discussion The same mechanism that produced the effects of PRC lesions in Simulation 1 also drives
PRC lesion deficits in Simulation 2. At High Interference, because all trials contain the same class of stimuli, stimulus features appear repeatedly over trials, and posterior feature representations reach maximum familiarity. Once this occurs,
there is no increase in familiarity when a network inspects a
new stimulus at the start of a trial. Consequently, a network
without a PRC layer cannot detect 'novelty' (a drop in familiarity) upon switching to the other stimulus.
At Low Interference, two-thirds of trials contain photos
composed of different features than the critical-trial stimuli.
The critical-trial stimulus features repeat too infrequently for
their representations to reach maximum familiarity, hence lesioned networks remain unimpaired.

Discussion
Barense et al. (2012) reported a striking perceptual deficit in
patients with MTL damage: the accumulation of perceptual
experience impairs visual discrimination. This result is paradoxical because perceptual discrimination typically improves
with exposure to the stimuli. Barense et al. argued that MTLlesioned patients suffer from accumulated feature-level interference, which − in the absence of conjunctive MTL representations − cannot be overcome by feature representations
in posterior visual cortex. Although we concur with this explanation, we suggest that it is incomplete.
Standard theories of perceptual learning claim that experience improves discrimination performance by reducing the

2091

overlap between stimulus representations (i.e., training increases representational separation). In such theories, the assumed mechanism for visual discrimination is that discriminability is proportional to the overlap between representations (Saksida, 1999; Schoups et al., 2001). But such proportionality could not account for the data of Barense et al.: if
exposure separates representations, even feature-based discrimination should improve with exposure because even feature representations should get less overlapping with training.
To explain why the performance of MTL patients in Barense
et al. got worse after exposure to the stimuli, a theory based
on representational overlap would require the counter-intuitive assumption that while cortical representations of stimuli
underlying perceptual learning often become less overlapping with exposure, posterior feature representations in this
task became more overlapping.
In our account of the data, we eschew representational
overlap as the mechanism for visual discrimination. Instead,
we take the account offered by Barense et al. (i.e., amnesics
suffer from the loss of conjunctive MTL representations) and
combine it with a less commonly invoked discrimination
mechanism: a familiarity heuristic. Under this account – as in
prior instances of the RH account applied to memory (Cowell
et al., 2006; McTighe et al., 2010) – representations of features, but not conjunctions, reach maximum familiarity as interference accrues. Thus, after MTL damage, perceptual experience impairs visual discrimination performance.
Before concluding, we clarify two important points. First,
although we simulate only two layers in the ventral pathway,
this is a subset of the full hierarchy of representations, which
includes simpler layers prior to our model's posterior layer
and more complex layers such as hippocampus after PRC.
Other tasks may require other layers. For example, a discrimination task involving whole objects that repeat would require
hippocampal representations capable of combining objects
with (e.g.) context, to shield participants from object-level interference that would detrimentally affect PRC representations. Second, we do not suggest that a familiarity heuristic
must be used in all discriminations, including easy tasks in
which stimuli differ on the basis of simple, salient features
such as color: such tasks could be solved by a more standard
discrimination mechanism of assessing representational
overlap. Our model suggests only that a familiarity heuristic
is used for difficult discriminations between similar stimuli
such as used in Barense et al.
In sum, we simulated the visual discrimination performance of MTL amnesics with a neural network model that
differs only in trivial details from the recognition memory
model of Cowell et al. (2006). To our knowledge, this is the
first computational model to simulate both mnemonic and
perceptual deficits caused by MTL damage using a unified
architecture and mechanism.
