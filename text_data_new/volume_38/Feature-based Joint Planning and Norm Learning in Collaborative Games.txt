Abstract

People often use norms to coordinate behavior and
accomplish shared goals. But how do people learn and
represent norms? Here, we formalize the process by which
collaborating individuals (1) reason about group plans during
interaction, and (2) use task features to abstractly represent
norms. In Experiment 1, we test the assumptions of our model
in a gridworld that requires coordination and contrast it with a
“best response” model. In Experiment 2, we use our model to
test whether group members’ joint planning relies more on
state features independent of other agents (landmark-based
features) or state features determined by the configuration of
agents (agent-relative features).

Introduction
From driving to running institutions like the U.S. Postal
Service, groups need to coordinate their behaviors to
accomplish shared goals. Key to this is that agents learn and
use norms to guide individual and collective behavior. But
how do people (or more generally, how can any intelligent
agent) represent and learn norms?
One approach is to treat coordination as emerging through
the ego-centric behavior of individual agents. For instance,
norms can emerge when agents have other-regarding or
aligned preferences (Binmore, 2010). Other approaches use
off-the-shelf algorithms, like Q-learning, to show how under
certain reward structures, “socially-blind” learning
mechanisms can produce social norms (Sen & Airiau, 2007;
Claus & Boutilier, 1998). More sophisticated approaches
allow agents to model others and best respond to the
predictions of those models. For example, agents can
recursively reason about one another in cognitive
hierarchies (Camerer et al., 2004; Wunder et al., 2011).
These computational approaches generally make two key
assumptions: First, norms are modeled as emergent
behavioral by-products rather than intended outcomes of
agents’ learning mechanisms. Second, the space of possible
norms is generally constrained to a small set of singular
actions (e.g. cooperate or defect in Flood and Dresher’s
Prisoner’s Dilemma). As a result, the representation of a
norm is never distinguished from the low-level actions that
instantiate the norm.
Unfortunately, psychological research and intuition raise
doubts about applying these assumptions to people. For

instance, people take a group perspective when choosing
their actions in coordination games using focal points
(Schelling, 1960; Bardsley et al., 2010). Similarly, norms
like “curb your dog” seem to rely on learned abstract
representations that are applied flexibly to new situations.
With this in mind, we have formulated a computational
model that incorporates two novel properties:
(1) Agents reason as if they were part of a single agent
with joint mental states like beliefs, desires, and plans.
For instance, a postal worker does not simply reason
in terms of “I-intentions” (e.g. I will bring these letters
to this address), but also in terms of “we-intentions”
(e.g. I will deliver these letters so we can deliver the
mail) (Searle, 1995; Bacharach, 2006).
(2) Norms are represented as joint planning biases that
reflect instructions to perform (or avoid) actions.
Following Biccheri (2006), agents both follow these
instructions and expect others to as well. Formally,
these are feature-based reward functions for when an
agent plans actions. This provides a compact
representation for norms that enables generalization.
This model represents a first step towards understanding
how norms are learned through joint reasoning and
represented abstractly, aspects of human norm learning not
captured in previous formulations.
To study how people learn norms, we focus on multistate, multi-round coordination games. In our tasks, payoffs
are always shared and depend on multi-state planning to
reach individual goals simultaneously. In two experiments,
we examine the extent to which our model captures how
people learn norms. Experiment 1 compares people’s
behavior to our Norm-Learning model and a Best-Response
model that plans actions optimally according to a learned
model of its partner. Experiment 2 uses the Norm-Learning
model to examine how people generalize norms across
situations and the extent to which they use landmark-based
or agent-relative features.

Computational Models
Norms are instructions that individuals follow and expect
others to follow. We formalize this notion and describe how
a group of norm-following agents can converge on norms in
a decentralized manner.

Multi-Agent Decision Making
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Stochastic
Games MDPs model single-agent decision making and are
defined by the tuple (𝑆, 𝐴, 𝑇, 𝑅): a set of states in the world,
𝑆; a set of actions the agent can take, 𝐴; transition dynamics,
𝑇(𝑠 ! |𝑠, 𝑎), which assign a probability of transitioning to a
state 𝑠 ! ∈ 𝑆 after an agent takes action 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 in state 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆;
and a reward function 𝑅 𝑠, 𝑎, 𝑠 ! , which returns a real
valued reward when transitioning to state 𝑠′ after the agent
has taken action 𝑎 in state 𝑠 ! . An agent in an MDP has a
policy (a mapping from states to actions) 𝜋: 𝑆 → 𝐴. An
agent’s policy relates directly to the value, or expected
future discounted reward, of each state: 𝑉 𝑠! =
!
𝐸! !
!!! 𝛾 𝑅 𝑠! , 𝑎! , 𝑠!!! , where 𝛾 ∈ 0,1 is a discount
factor specifying the value of immediate rewards relative to
temporally distant ones. Here, 𝛾 = .95.
To find an optimal policy, an agent needs to calculate the
optimal state (𝑉 ∗ 𝑠 ) and state-action (𝑄 ∗ (𝑠, 𝑎)) value
functions. Given these functions, the optimal policy can be
derived by taking the action with the highest value:
𝜋 ∗ (𝑠) ∈ argmax!∈! 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) (Sutton & Barto, 1998).
MDPs can be extended to include multiple agents using
game theoretic tools (Littman, 1994). A stochastic game is
defined by the tuple (𝐼, 𝑆, 𝐴! , 𝑇, 𝑅 ! ), where 𝐼 is an index set
of agents in the environment, 𝑆 is the set of states; 𝐴! is the
set of actions for each of the agents with 𝐴! denoting the
action set of agent 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼; 𝑇 𝑠 ! 𝑠, 𝑗 defines the task
dynamics by specifying transition probabilities given a joint
action, 𝑗 ∈×! 𝐴! , of all agents taken in state 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆; and 𝑅 ! is
a set of reward functions for each agent, with 𝑅 ! 𝑠, 𝑗, 𝑠 !
denoting the reward received by agent 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 when agents in
state 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 take joint action 𝑗 ∈×! 𝐴! and the environment
transitions to state 𝑠 ! ∈ 𝑆.
Because multiple agents with individual reward functions
are involved, there is no direct analogue of an ‘optimal
policy’ in stochastic games. Rather, solution concepts can
be posited (e.g. Nash equilibria) or a learning mechanism
can determine how the multi-agent system converges.

Norm-Learning Model
Norms as reward function biases We assume that norms
are instructions that an agent (a) follows, and (b) expects
others to follow. More formally, we first represent the
instructional content of norms as reward biases that cause a
group of agents to prefer certain types of actions or states.
For example, a norm to “drive on the right” would be
represented as a collective preference for states that satisfy
that description. This provides a natural, flexible way to
represent the content of norms. To simplify the problem, we
assume the norm bias is based on a linear combination of
state features. Assuming agents have a feature function, 𝛷,
that maps states to feature vectors, the norm bias is
represented as:
𝑅norm 𝑠 = 𝜃 ! 𝛷 𝑠

where 𝜃 ! is the transpose of a feature weighting vector. This
allows the model to learn that certain state features (e.g.
being on the right) is preferable during joint planning.
Second, we incorporate the motivational influence of
norms directly into individual agents’ reward functions that
are used to calculate a reward-maximizing policy. Formally,
for the 𝑖-th agent in a community, their total reward function
will combine their private reward function and a norm bias:
!
𝑅 ! 𝑠 = 𝑅individual
𝑠 + 𝑅norm 𝑠 .

All agents in the community will have the same norm bias,
𝑅norm , and know other agents will follow it. Thus, norms are
joint reward function biases that agents follow and expect
other agents to follow.
Inferring Norms We implement learning norms as group
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). In single-agent IRL
one observes an agent behaving in an MDP and based on
those observations infers the goals or reward function of the
agent (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Baker et al., 2009).
A Norm-Learning agent attempts to infer the norm that a
group follows given some history of group interaction. That
is, each agent estimates the most likely norm given a history
of interaction, ℋ = 𝑠! , 𝑗! , 𝑠! , … , 𝑠!!! , 𝑗!!! , 𝑠! :
𝑅norm = argmax 𝑃 𝑅norm ℋ ).
!norm

Since the norm bias function is a linear weighting of
features, this corresponds to finding the most likely
weights, 𝜃.
Here, we focus on norm learning in collaborative games.
That is, we assume that all agents all have the same goal
!
(i.e. have the same 𝑅individual
) but must figure out how to
work together to accomplish it. This simplifies inferring the
norm bias. Other work should investigate how norm
learning interacts in competitive scenarios (e.g. see
Kleiman-Weiner et al. in this year’s proceedings).
Features for Learning Norms Our representation of norms
and implementation of norm learning depends on the
features available to individuals in the group. The specific
features are important for several reasons. First, to converge
on a norm, individuals must have sufficiently similar
features available to them to determine which norm the
group uses. Second, features must be sufficiently expressive
to allow individuals to pin down the norm that they
collectively use to solve a task. Third, learning norms in
terms of features allows generalization to novel situations.
Without a concise, abstract representation of a norm, people
would not be able to apply a learned norm to a new context
and would need to learn an appropriate norm from scratch.
For the tasks in the experiments reported, we describe which
types of features are used for constructing norms.

1159

We consider two types of features: landmark-based
features, such as “Agent X is north of its goal”, and agentrelative features, such as “Agent X is north of Agent Y”.
These two types were chosen because the former are an
‘asocial’ representation, while the latter explicitly involve
social others. Moreover, they lead to different predictions in
the tasks we use.

Best-Response Model
Best-response agents individually plan using a model of
other agents. This means that instead of reasoning about a
joint-policy directly, an agent i uses a predictive model of
another agent j’s policy, 𝜋! , to predict what j will do in a
certain state. That is, an agent i will construct a transition
function that includes predictions about the behavior of the
other agent, 𝑇! (𝑠 ! |𝑠, 𝑎! ) = 𝑇 𝑠 ! 𝑠, 𝑎! , 𝜋 𝑠 .
Here, we use a level-1 cognitive hierarchy planner as our
Best-Response model. It models its partner’s behavior
directly by counting its partner’s actions and decaying past
counts by a parameter 𝛿. Additionally, to accelerate
learning, the model assigns a pseudocount, 𝛼, to joint states
in which the partner’s location on the grid is the same1.
Although we could have modeled a higher level of
reasoning (e.g. best responding to a level-1 planner) we did
not for two reasons. First, previous experimental work has
shown that people do not typically reason beyond one or
two levels (Camerer et al., 2004). Second, in noncompetitive contexts, strategies often converge at higher
levels in the cognitive hierarchy, and even level-1 reasoning
provides a good estimate of this converged behavior
(Bardsley et al., 2010).

Experiment 1: Hallway Task
Task Description
To test whether people best respond or learn norms, we
designed the 2-person Hallway task shown in Figure 1. Two
agents (circles) start at opposite ends of a 5x3 grid and on
each turn simultaneously move up, down, left, right, or wait.
The two agents cannot enter the same state or immediately
switch positions – if they attempt this, then they collide and
remain in the same location as in the previous time-step.
Each agent has its own goal tile, indicated by a matching
color, and the two agents start the task on one another’s
goals. Whenever either agent enters its own goal state, the
round ends. However, to succeed in a round (and in the
human case win a bonus), the agents must simultaneously
enter their respective goals. This necessitates collaboration.
At the beginning of a round, each agent is exactly 4 tiles
away from its goal. But they cannot both take a direct route
to their goals without colliding. Rather, they must choose a
series of actions that enables them to “break the symmetry”
1

For example, if the agent is at (1,1) and the partner is at (0,0),
then the partner’s behavior will be generalized to other joint states
where it is at (0,0). In this paper 𝛿 = 0.5, 𝛼 = 0.5.

top and bottom rows, and (b) they pass on middle and top
rows. Smaller circles indicate the agent waited a step.
and pass one another. Critically, at least one of the two
agents has to deviate from the center row of the grid and
return to the center for the two to successfully complete the
task. The other agent will either have to do the same, but on
a different row, or wait two time-steps for the other agent.
Figure 1 displays two joint plans that successfully complete
the task in the minimal number of steps (6). Note though
that there are many other possible joint actions that the two
agents can take to pass one another.
In a given round, we can consider the row that each player
is on when the two pass. Each player can be either on the
top, bottom, or center row when attempting to move closer
to their own goal. Clearly, successful passing requires that
the two agents be on different rows while attempting to
pass. Figure 2 visualizes this as an outcome matrix.
Executing a successful joint policy, defined as both agents
reaching their goal in the minimal number of steps, requires

that both agents select different passing rows.

function of each player’s row in the gridworld. Note that
“Success” means the game was solved optimally.

Model Simulations
Best-Response Suppose two Best-Response agents succeed
where player 1 passes through the center and player 2 passes
along the top ({center, top, success}). Having observed
player 2’s behavior, player 1’s predicts that player 2 will
again choose top. From player 1’s perspective, it is equally
optimal to choose center as it is to choose bottom. However,
if player 2 reasons similarly about player 1, then player 2
will treat top or bottom as equally optimal. If the players
choose their respective pairs of equally optimal actions at

rounds (out of 20) in which both agents scored, (b) number of rounds in which agents collided at least once, and (c)

random (i.e. 0.5 each), then they will stay at {center, top,
success} with .25 probability, switch to the {bottom, top,
success} or {center, bottom, success} cells with 0.5
probability, or switch to {bottom, bottom, fail} with .25
probability. In our implementation, the probabilities differ
from this ideal due to the decaying memory. Nonetheless,
this illustrates the central prediction of best-response
decision making in this collaborative game: that there will
be high row-passing switching as well as a moderate amount
of collisions from agents simultaneously switching.
Note also that the memoryless, mixed-strategy Nash
equilibrium is itself a type of best-response solution
concept. In this particular coordination game it is
1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 , which leads to an even higher proportion
of collisions – 1 3 – as well as switching – 2 3.
Norm-Learning In the Norm-Learning model, two agents
observe the same history of interaction, and use this to infer
the most likely norm that a hypothetical collective agent is
using. By using their shared observations and reasoning
processes to deduce the most likely norm that they as a
group have, they converge on and stay with a particular
norm. For the Hallway task, we use a set of landmark-based
features to define the space of norm reward biases.
Specifically, for each of the two agents, we represent which
row they are on relative to the row that their goal is on:
above (top), on (center), or below their goal’s row (bottom).
This gives us a total of 6 binary goal-based features.
Unlike the Best-Response model, the Norm-Learning
model predicts that people will stick with a combination of
rows when performing the task. That is, in dyads that
collaborate successfully, participants will not change which
row they pass on and there will be few, if any, collisions.

Experiment
Design and Procedure We recruited 50 MTurk participants
(25 dyads). They signed a consent form and then completed

demo tasks that familiarized them with the grid game
interface and task dynamics. They received a $2.00 base
payment and an additional $0.10 bonus when they
simultaneously reached their goals. Afterwards, each
participant completed a post-task survey that included
questions about the task and demographics. One dyad was
excluded from analysis due to missing data.
For the simulations, agent dyads played 20 rounds and
only learned at the end of each round. The Best-Response
model updated its model of its partner based on the play the
previous round, while the Norm-Learning model updated its
distribution over possible norm biases. To simplify
inference, we considered the space of feature weights to be
𝜃 ∈ −1,0,1 !! .
Results and Discussion Participants reported the task being
relatively easy where 1 = Very Difficult to 7 = Very Easy
(Mean = 5.67; SE = .19). Additionally, participants reported
that they were skilled at the task on a scale from 1 = Very
Bad to 7 = Very Good (Mean = 5.64; SE = .18).
The dyads were successful at collaborating on the task
and winning the bonus. For our analysis, we focused on
dyads that scored more than half of the rounds (23 of 24
dyads). These dyads, on average, jointly scored 17.5 out of
20 rounds (SE = 0.50) and jointly scored in the minimum
number of steps possible (6) 15.22 out of 20 rounds (SE =
0.85). Human rounds scored did not differ from the NormLearning model (t(35.307) = 1.82, p = 0.07) but did differ
from the Best-Response model (t(38.0) = 4.98, p < .001)
(Figure 3a). However, direct comparison by scoring is
difficult since the simulations update only once a round
completes. This leads the Best-Response model to
potentially collide indefinitely and never reach its goal.
Overall, the experimental results resemble the predictions
of the Norm-Learning model over the Best-Response model.
To compare human behavior in the collaborative Hallway
task to the models, we focused on two measures: the
number of rounds in which the agents collided at least once,

1161

and the proportion of rounds in which agents switched their
strategy from the previous round.
Figure 3b plots the number of rounds in which at least one
collision occurred for a dyad. Human collisions fell directly
in between the Norm-Learning model and Best-Response
model and significantly differed from the numbers in both
models (Best-Response: t(34.7) = -2.67, p = 0.01; NormLearning: t(33.2) = 2.49, p = 0.02). While this fails to
distinguish between the two idealized models presented, it is
consistent with a noisy or imperfect norm learning process.
To determine what strategy human and simulated agents
used in a given round, we used the following heuristic: the
first time a dyad collided in a round, the respective rows of
the agents were coded as their strategies (note that agent
locations after a collision remain the same as before). If a
dyad never collided in a round we looked at the first step in
which they were in the same column or switched columns -i.e. the step at which they passed one another. Their
respective rows after passing were coded as their strategy.
The amount of trial-to-trial strategy-switching provides a
critical contrast between the Norm-Learning model and
Best-Response model. Individuals in the human dyads
switched their strategies rarely (14% of rounds) (Figure 3c).
This closely matches the predictions of the Norm-Learning
model (t(38.8) = 0.66, p = .51) and deviates significantly
from the Best-Response model (t(40.9) = -6.14, p < .001). A
related measure of joint strategy diversity tells us about
global rather than local variability. To measure this, we
calculated the entropy of the frequency distributions of joint
strategies. Although the joint strategy entropy for humans
significantly differed from both models (Norm-Learning:
t(36.6) = 2.81, p < .001; Best-Response: t(36.2) = -5.55, p <
.001), human entropy was closer to Norm-Learner entropy
(Human: M = 0.68, SE = 0.10; Norm-Learning: M = 0.34,
SE = 0.06; Best-Response: M = 1.34, SE = 0.06). Overall
then, people displayed behavior more consistent with
learning a jointly understood norm rather than best
responding to their partner’s behavior.2

Experiment 2: Feature-Based Norm
Generalization
In our model, feature-based norms allow agents to converge
on a joint strategy quickly, but they also enable individuals
to generalize norms to new contexts. Here, we present the
predictions of two sets of landmark-based features and one
set of agent-relative features. We show that human norm
learning better resembles landmark-based features assuming
people learn norms like the Norm-Learning model.

entrances. In Indirect Courtyard, agents must first move
upwards towards entrances to cross. But both versions
require agents to devise a way to pass. In our simulations
and experiment, agents first play 10 rounds of Direct
Courtyard, followed by 10 rounds of Indirect Courtyard.
If the agents have no means of generalizing learned joint
plans, then they will have to find a new one when moving
from Direct to Indirect Courtyard. On the other hand, if they
learned a norm as a feature-based reward bias, then they can
use it to guide their strategy choice on Indirect Courtyard.

Models
We tested three sets of binary feature-based reward biases:
goal-relative features – is agent X’s current row above,
below, or the same as the goal row? (fn = 2 agents x 3
features = 6 total features) –, entrance-relative features – is
agent X’s current row above, below, or the same as the
entrances? (fn = 6) –, and agent-relative features – is agent
X above, below, or on the same row as agent Y? (fn = 3). 40
simulations of each model were run.

Experiment
Procedure 90 MTurkers (45 dyads) participated. 3 dyads
were excluded due to technical error. The procedure
matched Experiment 1 except participants played 2 games.
Results and Discussion To determine whether and how
participants generalized from Direct to Indirect Courtyard,
we analyzed individual strategies within dominant joint
strategies. Each round, we identified the strategy used with
the same heuristic as in Experiment 1. For each dyad, we
then identified the most frequent strategies in the Direct
Courtyard and Indirect Courtyard phases. We then identified
each agent’s individual strategy in the two phases. Figure 5a
shows individual strategy counts in the two phases. Note
that if people were forming new joint plans from scratch, the
strategies in the two phases would be uncorrelated. This was
not the case (𝜒 ! (4) = 27.45, p < .001).
To explain the systematicity in how joint plans were
generalized to the Indirect Courtyard, we compared this
distribution to the simulation results of our three models
(Figure 5b, 5c, and 5d). A visual analysis of these tables
suggested that the participant results reflect a mixture of
goal-relative and entrance-relative features. We confirmed

Task Description
We designed the Courtyard tasks shown in Figure 4 to test
norm generalization. In Direct Courtyard, agents can
immediately move towards their respective goals through

with example optimal joint plans. The bold lines are
walls that agents cannot pass through.

We assume that best responders do not default to the previous
choice if indifferent between options. Future studies will need to
rule this out in people.

participants, (b) our Norm-Learning agent with Agent-Relative features, (c) Goal-Based features, and (d) Entrance-Based
features. The distribution indicates which row an agent is likely to take in the Indirect Courtyard grid given what row was
taken in the Direct Courtyard. Human results are best explained as a mixture of the two landmark-based feature sets (Goalbased and Entrance-based; see text). Grayed out rows in the gridworlds indicate the most frequent individual strategy.
this by calculating maximum likelihood mixture values for
the three models: pEntrance = 0.21, pGoal = 0.79, and pAgent =
0.0. Thus, participants tended to generalize norms using
landmark-based rather than agent-relative features.

Conclusion
Here, we have presented a novel model of norm learning
based on inferring joint reward biases. We compared the
predictions of this model to those of a best response model
in the Hallway task, and used the same model to show that
people use landmark-based rather than agent-relative
features to generalize norms across the two Courtyard tasks.
A central aspect of human sociality is engaging in shared
intentions and joint plans with others (Searle, 1995). Using
the formal tools of multi-agent MDPs, we are able to make
quantitative predictions about how collaborating individuals
represent and reason about themselves as part of a larger
entity. Future work should explore how individuals learn
norms over particular types of features, what happens when
agents’ feature sets differ from one another, and how
learned norms interact in competitive scenarios.
