Abstract

the pronoun referring to a particular referent. On the other
hand, the likelihood P(pronoun|referent) represents the production bias: the probability of the speaker using a pronoun
to refer to an intended referent. The prior P(referent) denotes
the NEXT- MENTION BIAS: the probability of a specific referent getting mentioned next in the context, independent of the
form of referring expression used.

Kehler and Rohde (2013) proposed a Bayesian theory of pronoun interpretation where the influence of world knowledge
emerges as effects on the prior and the influence of information
structure as effects on the likelihood: P(referent|pronoun) µ
P(pronoun|referent)P(referent). Here we present two experiments on Mandarin Chinese that allow us to test the generality
of the theory for a language with different syntactic-semantic
associations than English. Manipulations involving two different classes of implicit-causality verbs and passive vs. active
voice confirmed key predictions of the Bayesian theory: effects
of these manipulations on the prior and likelihood in production were consistently reflected in pronoun interpretation preferences. Quantitative analysis shows that the Bayesian model
is the best fit for Mandarin compared to two competing analyses. These results lend both qualitative and quantitative support to a cross linguistically general Bayesian theory of pronoun interpretation.

Introduction
Successful language understanding requires comprehenders
to resolve uncertainty in language. One source of potential
uncertainty emerges from pronouns (e.g., he, she, they, it)
since pronouns carry little information and usually do not
fully specify the intended referent semantically (e.g., Jane
invited Anne to her house and she had a great time). Nevertheless, humans generally interpret pronouns rapidly and
accurately. Previous work has proposed a variety of factors
that influence how comprehenders resolve pronouns. One
set of approaches has focused on grammatical factors such as
subjecthood preferences (Crawley et al., 1990), first-mention
preferences (Gernsbacher & Hargreaves, 1988), and parallel
grammatical role preferences (Smyth, 1994). Others have
focused on information structural features such as topicality. Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995), for instance,
uses information-structural relationships within and between
utterances and the grammatical roles of potential referents
to guide pronoun interpretation. Another approach has argued for the role of world knowledge in referent assignment.
The coherence-driven approach (Hobbs, 1979), for example,
models pronoun interpretation as a side-effect of the inference
processes that underpin general discourse processing.
Recent studies on pronoun interpretation (Kehler et al.,
2008; Kehler & Rohde, 2013) integrate aspects of the information structural approach and coherence-driven approach
by way of a probabilistic Bayesian framework. Kehler and
Rohde (2013) proposed that comprehenders reverse-engineer
speakers’ intended referents in terms of Bayes’ rule, as shown
in (M1). The posterior P(referent|pronoun) represents the interpretation bias: upon hearing a pronoun, the probability of

(M1)
Equation (M1) says that the relationship between pronoun
interpretation and pronoun production follows Bayesian principles, without further specifying which factors affect each
term in the numerator. Here we refer to this as the WEAK
form of the Bayesian hypothesis. Kehler & Rohde (2013)
further suggest that the factors conditioning the prior and the
likelihood are different: the influence from world knowledge
emerges as effects on the prior, and the influence from information structure as effects on the likelihood. We refer to this
specification as the STRONG form of the Bayesian hypothesis. This Bayesian model successfully accounts for a range of
English data. However, little work has investigated whether
the model generalizes across different languages.

The Present Study
This paper has two objectives. The first is to test the generality of the Bayesian pronoun interpretation theory crosslinguistically, specifically in the case of Mandarin Chinese. Experiment 1 serves as a base-line test case, where we use a passage completion paradigm that allows us to tease apart the influences of world knowledge from those of grammatical and
information structural factors. We provide both qualitative
and quantitative model evaluations for the experimental data
to test the Bayesian account.
The second objective is to further test the theory by way of
a syntactic manipulation, specifically the voice used in a context sentence (passive or active). Here we follow up on two
results found by Rohde & Kehler (2014) for English; to facilitate our descriptions, for the passive voice (e.g. Jane was
amazed by Sue) we use the “first noun phrase” NP1 to refer
to the clause’s logical object (the syntactic subject Jane), and
the “second noun phrase” NP2 to refer to the logical subject
Sue. First, on the assumption that being the syntactic subject of a passive clause is a stronger indicator of topichood
than being the syntactic subject of an active clause in English (because the speaker chose a syntactically marked con-

2393

struction to get the logical object into the syntactic subject
position), their theory predicts that the rate of pronominalization of the syntactic subject in the passive will be higher
than that in the corresponding active case, a prediction that
was confirmed by their study. Second, they also found an
unexpected effect whereby the voice manipulation influenced
next-mention biases. Specifically, Rohde et al. found that passivization increased the rate of next-mention for NP2 , the logical subject. This result was unexpected on the STRONG form
of the Bayesian theory. However, Rohde et al. also found that
pronoun interpretation reflected this effect of passivization on
next-mention preference, as predicted by the WEAK form of
the theory.
Here we examine whether similar effects are found for
Mandarin Chinese. The syntactic-semantic properties of Chinese passives make these constructions a good test case. Passive voice in Mandarin Chinese is generally realized via the
bei construction, with linear arrangement NP1 bei NP2 verb
(e.g., Li & Thompson, 1981). In this construction, NP1 is
the logical object followed by the passive signaling word bei,
which introduces the logical subject NP2 . The bei construction conveys the notion of AFFECTEDNESS (LaPolla, 1988);
it describes an event in which the logical object is affected
physically or psychologically in some way (Li & Thompson,
1981). We expect that the conveyance of AFFECTEDNESS
may increase the probability of mentioning the logical object in the next sentence. If this expectation is borne out in
the data, it affords the opportunity for an additional test of
the WEAK Bayesian theory, which predicts that any effect of
passivization on next-mention preferences should have a corresponding effect on pronoun interpretation preferences. We
test these predictions in Experiment 2.

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 provides a first test case for investigating the
generality of the Bayesian pronoun interpretation theory in
Mandarin Chinese. We used a passage completion paradigm
with a 2-by-2 design that allowed us to tease apart the influence of world knowledge-based inference that emerges from
verb semantics, and the influence of information structural
and grammatical factors by conditioning on the grammatical
role of the referent in the analysis.

Methods
Participants We recruited 50 self-reported native Mandarin speakers over Witmart (a China-based online crowdsourcing platform). Each of them was paid $4 for their participation in the experiment.
Materials and procedures Participants completed twosentence passages, writing a second sentence after a
transitive-verb context sentence with two like-gender animate
arguments. We used a Prompt Type by Verb Type design.
Prompt Type has two levels: The Free condition (1) included
no material in the second sentence prompt, allowing us to
estimate next-mention preferences P(referent) by analyzing

the first-mentioned referent in each condition, and the likelihood P(pronoun|referent) that a pronoun is produced to refer
to that referent by analyzing the referential forms that participants used. The Pronoun condition (2) included an overt pronoun in the second sentence, allowing us to measure empirical pronoun interpretation preferences P(referent|pronoun).
The verbs in the first sentence were taken from one of two
implicit causality (IC) classes (Garvey & Caramazza, 1974;
Brown & Fish, 1983). The use of IC verbs allowed us to manipulate the prior, with IC-1 and IC-2 favoring the syntactic
subject (NP1 ) and the non-subject (NP2 ) next-mentions respectively. A norming study (N=45) was conducted prior to
Experiment 1 to ensure the verbs we selected have a clear bias
towards re-mentioning either the subject or the non-subject.
We selected sixteen subject-biased IC-1 verbs and twenty
object-biased IC-2 verbs for the main experiments based on
the results of the norming study.

Because IC verbs exhibit the most polarized effects on
next-mention biases when the follow-on sentence provides
an explanation of (i.e., a cause or reason for) the event described by the prompt sentence (Rohde, 2008), we instructed
participants to limit their continuations to such explanations.
Each participant completed 36 target items and 36 filler items
with pseudo-randomization. Prompt Type varied within participants and within items; Verb Type varied only within participants. Each item was presented via the web interface on
a separate page with a text box where the participants were
instructed to write their continuations.
Coding The responses were coded by two trained native
speakers, the first author and a UC San Diego graduate student who was blind to the hypothesis of the study. Each coder
went through the responses independently to code the firstmentioned referent (or the assignment of the pronoun in the
case of the Pronoun prompt condition) in each continuation as
one of the five categories: NP1 , NP2 , both, unclear, and other.
If the two coders did not agree on a reference, or there was
not enough information available to identify the intended referent, the response was coded as unclear. For continuations
in the Free prompt conditions, choice of referring expressions
were coded as name, overt pronoun, null pronoun, and other.

Results and discussion
The analysis only included continuations for which the firstmentioned entity was NP1 or NP2 ; hence continuations were
excluded if the referent was coded as unclear (3.8%), both

Next-mention biases Figure 1 shows the proportion of
continuations about NP1 in both Free prompt and Pronoun
prompt conditions. We first evaluate the next-mention biases (dark blue bars) in the Free prompt data, which serves
as the prior in the Bayesian model. Analyses showed a
main effect of Verb Type (p < 0.001): subject-biased IC-1
items prompted significantly more continuations about NP1
(77.7%) than object-biased IC-2 items (11.7%). This indicates that verb semantics had a strong effect on next-mention
biases, an expected result on both the STRONG and WEAK
forms of the Bayesian hypothesis.

and overt pronouns, which serves as the likelihood in the

(0.8%), or other (2.7%). Continuations were also excluded
if the choice of referring expression was other than a name,
an overt pronoun, or a null pronoun (1.0%). After applying these restrictions, 1651 out of 1800 continuations in the
dataset remained. All statistical analyses in this paper report
results from mixed-effect logistic regression models with the
maximal random-effect structure justified by the design (Barr
et al., 2013), conducted using the lme4 R package (Bates et
al., 2015; R Core Team, 2015); we report significance levels
based on the Wald z statistic. In cases where we encountered
convergence failure with lme4, we report analyses carried out
using the MCMCglmm R package (Hadfield, 2010), which we
indicate by pMCMC in reporting statistical significance. Error bars in all figures are standard errors over by-participant
means.
The WEAK form of the Bayesian hypothesis predicts that
pronoun interpretation biases and production biases follow
Bayesian principles, without fully specifying what factors affect each component. The STRONG form of the hypothesis
additionally predicts that semantic factors (Verb Type) affect
only next-mention biases P(referent) and not pronoun production biases P(pronoun|referent); the primary factor affecting pronoun production biases is instead predicted to be the
grammatical role of the referent (Re-mentioned NP). We test
these predictions in the following analyses.

Figure 3: Quantitative model comparisons for Experiment 1

Bayesian model. Analyses showed a large main effect of
Re-mentioned NP (b = 1.37, p < 0.001), with NP1 rementions much more likely to be pronominalized than NP2
re-mentions. There was no significant interaction between
Re-mentioned NP and Verb Type (b = 0.053, p = 0.716).
Both results align with the predictions of both the STRONG
and WEAK hypotheses, indicating a clear disassociation between next-mention biases and production biases. There
was also a smaller, unanticipated main effect of Verb Type
(b = 0.43, p < 0.05), with pronominalization rates higher
in the IC-2 context than in the IC-1 context. The reasons for
this effect remain unclear.
Interpretation biases Now we examine the interpretation
biases (the posterior) and compare them to next-mention biases (the prior). As shown in Figure 1, there was a main effect of Verb Type (b = 2.021, p < 0.001), with IC-1 verbs
eliciting more NP1 mentions than IC-2 verbs. There was a
main effect of Prompt Type (b = 0.896, p < 0.001), with
the proportion of continuations about NP1 in the Pronoun
prompt condition higher than that in the Free prompt condition. Analyses also showed a interaction between Prompt
Type and Verb Type (b = 0.408, p < 0.001), whereby the
effect of Pronoun prompts was larger for IC-2 verbs than IC1 verbs. Given next-mention and production biases, the main
effects of Verb Type and Prompt Type are predicted by the
Bayesian theory (the interaction’s presence was neither predicted nor precluded).
Quantitative model comparisons Following Rohde &
Kehler (2014), we further evaluate the Bayesian account by
comparing its predictions with those of two competing models. The first competing model is the Expectancy model, according to which the interpretation bias towards a referent
is equal to the probability the referent gets mentioned next
(Arnold, 2001). For this model, the predicted interpretation
bias is estimated to be the prior next-mention bias. We express this model in Equation (M2) below, using the assignment operator to emphasize that this model does not follow
normative probability theory.
P(referent|pronoun)

2395

P(referent)

(M2)

The second competing model we call the Mirror model, according to which the interpretation bias towards an entity is
proportional to the likelihood that a reference to that entity
would have been pronominalized by the speaker. This model
captures the intuition that pronoun interpretation and production are effectively mirror images of each other, as expressed
by the assignment in (M3).

referent2referents

To determine the quantitative predictions of each model
(M1)–(M3), we used the Free prompt data to estimate
[condition+item]-specific prior and likelihood probabilities
P(referent) and P(pronoun|referent), using add-one smoothing to avoid zero probabilities, and then compared these
predictions to [condition+item]-specific human interpretation
preferences from our Pronoun prompt data. Figure 3 plots
observed NP1 interpretation rates against item-specific predictions of the three models. The x = y dotted line would be
a perfect model fit. The Bayesian model had the least meansquared error (0.03), indicating the Bayesian model is a better
fit than either of the competing models in predicting pronoun
interpretation. In comparison, the Mirror model dramatically
underpredicts cross-item/condition variability in interpretation preference, because it lacks the influence of the worldknowledge-derived prior. The Expectancy model systematically underpredicts the rate of NP1 pronoun interpretation,
because it lacks the likelihood-derived bias toward NP1 obtaining from the speaker’s choice of pronominal form.

STRONG hypothesis predicts that the difference in information structure between active and passive voice will affect
production biases, and in turn interpretation biases. A finding similar to Rohde and Kehler’s whereby passivization increases the next-mention bias for the logical subject is not
predicted by the STRONG hypothesis, however. The WEAK
hypothesis makes no commitment to the either of these predictions. Instead, the WEAK hypothesis simply predicts that
any change in the pronoun production biases or the nextmention biases would affect interpretation biases, in accordance with Bayes’ rule.

Methods
Participants We recruited 71 self-reported native Mandarin speakers over Witmart. Each of them was paid $4 for
their participation in the experiment. None of them participated in Experiment 1.
Materials and procedures The same passage completion
paradigm as Experiment 1 was employed. In addition to the
Verb Type ⇥ Prompt Type design, we included a Voice (active
vs. passive) manipulation. Participants were asked to write a
natural continuation given the prompt (unlike Experiment 1,
participants were not limited to writing explanations). The
verbs were identical with the ones in Experiment 1 with one
exception: We replaced “anwei” (comfort) with “xiaokan”
(look down upon) since the former sounds unnatural in a passive clause. Example stimuli are shown in (5)-(8).

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 further tests the generality of the Bayesian pronoun theory by pursuing a set of findings regarding the effect
of voice on pronoun behavior identified for English by Rohde
& Kehler (2014). Recall that Rohde and Kehler hypothesized
that a difference in syntactic form — specifically active vs.
passive voice — would have an effect on production biases.
This expectation is based on the STRONG Bayesian hypothesis, which posits that the likelihood of a speaker pronominalizing a mention of a referent is based on the referent’s
degree of topicality. Hypothesizing that being the subject of
a passive clause is a stronger indicator of topichood than being the subject of an active clause, Rohde & Kehler (2014)
thus predicted that the syntactic subject of a passive clause is
more likely to be pronominalized than that of an active clause.
The results of their study confirmed this prediction. However,
the results also revealed a separate effect, unexpected under
the STRONG hypothesis, whereby passivization not only affected the next-mention bias as well, but did so in the opposite direction that one would expect: Passivization increased
the next-mention rate of the logical subject, that is, the entity
mentioned from within a by- adjunct.
Here we evaluate the predictions of the models by employing a similar voice manipulation in Mandarin Chinese. The

Each participant completed 36 target items and 36 filler
items with pseudo-randomization. Prompt Type and Voice
varied within participants and within items; Verb Type varied
only within participants. Participants wrote passage continuations using the same web interface as in Experiment 1.
Coding The same judges coded the responses using the
same criteria as those in Experiment 1.

Results and discussion
Out of 2556 continuations, 8.7% were excluded because the
next-mentioned referent was coded as unclear, both, or other,
or the choice of referring expressions was other than a name,
an overt pronoun, or a null pronoun, leaving a total of 2334
continuations in the dataset.

voice manipulation. The Free prompt condition (blue bars)
showed a main effect of Verb Type (b = 0.987, p < 0.001),
whereby IC-2 verbs elicited more continuations about the logical object than IC-1 verbs. Analyses also showed a main
effect of Voice (b = 0.477, p < 0.001), whereby passivization increased continuations about the logical object. The effect of Verb Type is compatible with both the STRONG and
the WEAK versions of the Bayesian hypothesis. However,
the effect of Voice is only consistent with the WEAK version
since the STRONG version predicts that information structure
should only affect the likelihood.
Production biases Figure 6 presents the rate of pronominalization, collapsing both null and overt pronouns. Results
showed a main effect of Re-mentioned NP (pMCMC < 0.001),
with NP1 more likely to be pronominalized than NP2 regardless of its semantic roles. There was no main effect of Voice
(pMCMC = 0.38) or Verb Type (pMCMC = 0.75). The higher
rate of pronominalization of NP1 is compatible with both the
STRONG and WEAK versions of the Bayesian hypothesis, as
is the lack of effect of Verb Type. The lack of Voice effect is not compatible with the STRONG version, however,
which predicts that the syntactic subject of a passive clause
is more likely to be pronominalized than that of an active
clause. These results instead suggest that grammatical role
is the primary factor affecting pronoun production biases.
Interpretation biases To better illustrate the comparisons
between next-mention biases (the prior) and interpretation biases (the posterior) in relation to NP1 re-mentions, we graph
the data from Figure 4 in terms of re-mentions of the syntactic
subject in Figure 5. Analyses showed a main effect of Prompt
Type (pMCMC < 0.001), with Pronoun prompts being associated with more NP1 re-mentions than Free prompts. Analyses also showed a main effect of Voice (pMCMC < 0.001),
with passive voice eliciting more NP1 re-mentions than active
voice, as well as a marginal effect of Verb Type (pMCMC =
0.063), with IC-1 verbs eliciting numerically more NP1 rementions collapsing Voice and Prompt Type. The Bayesian
hypothesis predicts both the observed effect of Prompt Type,

due to the likelihood term in Equation (M1), and the close
relationship between the NP1 re-mention rate in the Pronoun
and Free prompt types across Verb Type and Voice conditions, due to the effect of the prior.
We have shown in Figure 4 (blue bars) that passivization
increased next-mention rate for the logical object NP2 . The
Bayesian hypothesis predicts that any effect of passivization
on next-mention biases should have a corresponding effect
on pronoun interpretation biases. The dashed lines in Figure 4 illustrate the NP1 re-mention rate that would be predicted for passives under an alternative model that is identical to M1 except that the normatively correct prior term
P(referent = NP1 |passive) is replaced with the active-voice
prior term P(referent = NP1 |active). This alternative model
underpredicts the observed rate of NP2 re-mention, showing
that the passive voice’s effect of increased next-mention prior
bias toward the logical object indeed manifests in pronoun
interpretation preferences.
Quantitative model comparisons We again used the Free
prompt data to estimate the interpretation biases of overt pronouns for each item, and then compared the predictions to the
actual interpretation data measured in the Pronoun prompt
condition. Figure 7 plots observed NP1 interpretation rates
against item-specific predictions of the three models. The
x = y dotted line would be perfect model fit. As also seen
in Experiment 1, the Mirror model underpredicts cross-item
variability in interpretation preferences, and the Expectancy
model systematically underestimates the likelihood-derived
preference toward NP1 . Once again, the Bayesian model had
the least mean-squared error (0.05) of the three models.

General Discussion
The results from Experiment 1 showed that verb semantics
had a strong effect on next-mention biases, where IC-1 verbs
elicited more mentions of the subject than IC-2 verbs. The
results also showed that the grammatical roles of potential
referents had a significant impact on the likelihood of producing a pronoun given a particular referent, with re-mentions of

2397

the subject of the previous sentence (NP1 ) more likely to be
pronominalized than re-mentions of the non-subject (NP2 ).
Importantly, this held even in the object-biased IC-2 conditions. This and the lack of interaction between Verb Type
and Re-mentioned NP in Figure 2 reveal a disassociation between the factors that determine what entities get mentioned
next versus those that determine whether those mentions get
pronominalized. When interpreting an ambiguous pronoun,
the comprehender takes into account both the prior probability of a referent being mentioned next in the context and
the likelihood that the speaker would choose a pronoun to
mention that referent. As illustrated in Figure 1, the presence
of an overt pronoun boosted NP1 mentions in both IC-1 and
IC-2 contexts compared to the Free prompt condition. This
indicates the effect of the likelihood (the probability of NP1
being realized pronominally) on pronoun interpretation when
the prior next-mention probability is kept constant.
The results from Experiment 2 show that passivization increases the rate of next-mention of the logical object in Mandarin Chinese, reflecting the affectedness of the logical object in the passive bei construction. Results again showed
that occupying the subject position increases the likelihood
of pronominalizing the re-mention of an entity. On the
other hand, we found no consistent evidence showing that rementions of passive subjects are more often pronominalized
in Mandarin than re-mentions of active subjects, unlike what
Rohde & Kehler (2014) found in English.
Our results indicate that pronoun interpretation biases
do not straightforwardly mirror expectations about nextmention, nor do they simply mirror pronoun production biases. Rather, pronoun interpretation biases reflect the joint influence of next-mention biases and production biases, where
the comprehender reasons about the states of the world as
well as the speaker’s linguistic choices in conveying those
states. Comparisons between the full Bayesian model and
two reduced variants showed that the full Bayesian model
best predicted human behavior in pronoun interpretation,
lending quantitative support for the Bayesian theory. These
findings are broadly consistent with previous studies in English (Kehler & Rohde, 2013; Rohde & Kehler, 2014), but
also show that cross-linguistic variation in effects of grammatical voice on production preferences is mirrored in interpretation. Overall these results lend both qualitative and
quantitative support to a cross-linguistically general Bayesian
theory of pronoun interpretation.
