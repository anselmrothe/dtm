Abstract
Many studies have shown that observers can accurately
perceive and evaluate the statistical summary of presented
objects’ attribute values, such as the average, without
attending to each object. However, it remains controversial
how the visual system integrates the attribute values (e.g.,
information on size) of multiple items and computes the
average value. In this study, we tested how distributions of
item sizes affect the precision and bias in judging average
values. We predicted that if observers utilize all of the
available size information equally, the distribution would
have no effect, and vice versa. Our results showed that, with
novice observers, judgement precision differed among size
distributions and that the observers overestimated the size of
the average value compared to the actual size under all
conditions. These results imply that observations of some
items in a set could be weighted more easily than others, with
the possibility that this process is easier for larger items than
smaller ones. However, this was not the case for experienced
observers, who showed no effects of distribution type on
average assessment performance. Our findings imply that the
process of representing the average value may not be
explained by a single definitive mechanism and, is rather
mediated by a mixture of multiple cognitive processes.

Introduction
It has been shown that observers are able to quickly and
accurately extract average values over a range of visual
properties, including size (Chong & Treisman, 2005；Oriet
& Brand, 2013), brightness (Bauer, 2009), orientation
(Dakin and Watt, 1997; Parkes, Liend, Angelucci, Solomon
& Morgan, 2001), emotional expression (Haberman &
Whitney, 2009, 2011). This ability is not limited to static
and simultaneous events; it has been observed in
sequentially presented events (Albrecht, Scholl, & Chun,
2012; Corbett & Oriet, 2011; Hubert-Wallander & Boynton,
2015 ） and dynamic objects, such as expanding and
contracting disks (Albrecht ＆ Scholl, 2010). Moreover, the
ability to represent statistical properties is not limited to
visual cues but is also observed in perceptions from auditory
input, such as extracting frequency information from
sequences of sounds (Piazza, Sweeny, Wessel, Silver, &
Whitney, 2013) and temporal details of sounds (McDermatt,
Schemisch, & Simoncelli, 2013).

These
representations
of
statistical
summary
representations (SSRs), have been proposed to assist our
judgment and behavior and more efficiently than attending
to each objects and/or events individually (e.g., Alvarez,
2011; Ariely, 2001, 2008; Chong & Treisman, 2003;
Robitaille & Harris, 2011). Although there is a general
understanding that human observers can accurately
represent sets of features, the mechanism by which people
extract summary statistics is yet to be fully understood.
One of the debates over the mechanism of SSRs is
whether the average value is computed using the entire
information on display or using a subset of items in a set;
ideas on this have been classified into three types based on
findings from and discussions in previous studies.
The first idea is based on the claim that SSRs are
computed without computing individual items. Many
studies have provided the evidence that people can estimate
the average size of a set of items without relying on focused
attention on individual items when attention is distributed
across a set of similar items (e.g., Attarha, Moore, & Vecera,
2014; Chong & Treisman, 2003, 2005; Oriet & Brand,
2013; Oriet & Hozempa, 2016; Tokita, Ueda, & Ishiguchi,
2016).
In the second idea, the assertion is that all items in a set
are processed but not all items contribute equally to the
mean. This idea suggests that if some measures are very
reliable and others are not, observers may give the more
reliable measures more weight when combining them
(Alvarez, 2011). For example, Haberman and Whitney
(2010) tested how the deviant emotional expression was
utilized in averaging emotion shown on multiple faces and
suggested that people implicitly and unintentionally
discount the emotional outliers, thereby computing a
summary representation that involves the majority of the
information present. Hubert-Wallander and Boynton (2015)
tested how SSRs were computed when stimuli were
sequentially presented across time and found that they do
not incorporate all items equally.
The basis of the third idea is that average size is
computed using a limited sampling strategy which does not
necessitate an ensemble representation computed in parallel
across all items on display (Myczek & Simons, 2008;
Fockert & Marchant, 2008; Marchant, Simons, & Fockert,
2013). For example, Fockert and Marchant (2008) claimed
that observers do not always accurately average together the

entire set and that the average is either biased by features of
the attended item or based on the practical strategy of
extracting the mean of a smaller subset. In line with this
argument, Marchant, Simons, and Fockert (2013) tested
how the regularity of the item sizes affects the performance
of average size perception and demonstrated that judgments
of average size become less accurate with increases in the
set size and heterogeneity of the item sizes.
In this study, we further explored the mechanism of
estimating the average size of items in a set by manipulating
the frequency distribution of items. This is a useful
approach for determining whether observers utilize
information on all items equally, they weight the
information of some items and less of others, or they use a
limited number of items in a set (Chong & Treisman, 2003;
Duffy, Huttenlocher, Hedges & Crawford, 2010; Marchant
et al., 2013). For example, Duffy et al. (2010) used
asymmetric (skewed) distributions in which there was more
than one possible central value and demonstrated that
observers adjusted estimates toward the category’s running
mean.
We tested how frequency distributions of item sizes affect
the precision and bias in representing average size. Four
types of the distributions were used: uniform, negatively
skewed (i.e., Asym1), positively skewed (i.e., Asym2), and
pseudo-normal distributions. Figure 1 shows the sizes and
numbers of items in the stimulus set for each distribution.
We measured the Weber fraction of the discrimination task
to assess precision and also measured the point of subjective
equality (PSE) to test the accuracy of the estimation.

function of the number of sampled items under different
noise conditions: a. High internal noise, b. Low internal
noise
To predict the performance of size average estimation,
we used a computer simulation for calculating Weber
fractions and the PSEs for each distribution expressed as a
function of the number of sampled items, as shown in
Figure 2. Two levels of noise were used in the simulation,
with the values of the noise in each level being obtained
from previous research (Tokita et al., 2016). As shown in
the left-hand-side figures, when the average value was
computed in parallel across all items in the display,
performance was unaffected by the distribution of item size.
When a limited number of items in the set were used to
compute the average value, the performance was influenced
by item distribution. Under Asym2 and normal distributions,
precision was found to be better than that under uniform and
Asym1 distributions. Precision under Asym1 was higher
than under uniform. As shown in the right hand side of
Figure 2, the PSE results show that observer accuracy was
unaffected by distribution.
In addition, we conducted experiments with to two types
of observer: novice and experienced. Since some studies
have suggested that there are considerable individual
differences in simultaneous visual tasks (Tokita & Ishiguchi,
2010; Herbert & Whitney, 2015), we considered it
important to test how the effect of distribution differs
between novice and experienced observers. Note that “the
observers” refer to novice observers in this paper.

Experiment
We tested how the distributions of item sizes affect
performance and bias in representing the average sizes. To
examine the performance, we obtained Weber fractions that
would indicate the precision in the participants’ estimation
of average sizes. To examine bias, we obtained PSEs, which
indicate the constant error in estimation. In deriving the
Weber fractions and PSEs, we used the method of constant
stimuli, in which the observers in each trial decided which
size of stimuli—the average size of a displayed item set (i.e.,
standard stimuli) or a single item size (i.e., comparison
stimuli)—had larger.

Method
Participant As for novice observers, fourteen
undergraduate volunteers from Mejiro University
participated in exchange of course credit. All observers were
naïve as to the purpose of the study. Three experienced
observers including one of the authors, who have
participated in many psychophysical experiments such as
average estimation experiments were added. Two of the
observers did not know the purpose of the study. All had
normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Apparatus Stimuli were displayed on the iMac desktop
computer monitor (21-inch) controlled by a Macintosh
computer (Mac OS X). Stimuli were generated using the
Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (Brainard, 1997; Pelli,
1997) for MATLAB (Version 8.4, Mathworks, MA).
Participants viewed the screen with both eyes and seated
approximately 65 cm from the screen.

Figure 3: A schematic view of the stimulus presentation.
Each trial started with a fixation cross for 500ms. The items
in a set were presented first for 200 ms. The comparison
item was presented for 200ms after blank for 500 ms, and
then a blank screen until response.

Design Distributions of item sizes were manipulated. There
are four distribution types; uniform distribution, negatively
skewed distribution (Asym1), positively skewed distribution
(Asym2), and pseudo-normal distribution. A set of items
(i.e., standard stimuli) was presented in the first interval and
a comparison item was presented in the second interval.
Stimuli The standard stimuli consisted of fifteen of filled
light gray disks of various seizes, which were presented on
dark gray background. The disk sizes were equally spaced
on a log scale separated by a factor of 1.25. The comparison
stimuli was a single disk with a given levels. There were
five comparison levels, -0.14, -0.07, 0, 0.07, and 0.14
diameter differences on the power function scale. Three of
participants needed wider range of stepwise levels (i.e., 0.16, -0.08, 0, 0.08, and 0.16) due to the low accuracy.
The items were arranged on the array. The array was
divided into 4 × 4 matrix. Each item was displayed at the
center of each cell with a position jitter.
In each trial, all of the disks shown were randomly scaled
by a small multiplicative factor to discourage the
participants from basing heir judgments on previously seen
items. Three multiplicative factors (0.9, 1, 1.1) were used
and the same factor scaled all items in any one trial.
Procedure A schematic view of the stimulus presentation is
shown in Figure 3. Observers completed one 65-min session
that consisted of a practice block of 24 trials, followed by
five experiment blocks of 100 trials each (4 distribution
types × 5 comparison level × 5 repetitions). There are 500
trials in total. The distribution types and the comparison
level and the order of trials were all randomly mixed.
Each trial started with a fixation cross for 500ms. The
items in a set were presented first for 200 ms. The
comparison item was presented for 200ms after blank for
500 ms, and then a blank screen until response. The next
trial automatically began 500ms after the response.
Observers’ task was to decide whether the comparison
item was larger or smaller than the average size of item in a
set. A two-alternative (larger or smaller) forced choice
procedure was used. When they thought that the comparison
item is smaller than the average size of items in a set, they
pressed ‘1’, otherwise, they pressed ‘3’. No feedback about
the correctness of responses was provided.
Analysis The PSEs and Weber fractions were measured
using the method of constant stimuli. First, the relative sizes
for the comparison item were plotted on the x-axis, and the
proportion of greater responses for each comparison
stimulus was plotted on the y-axis, and fits were done for
individual data. The plotted data points constructed the
psychometric function approximated by a cumulative
Gaussian function for individual data.
This discrimination threshold was defined as the smallest
amount of the stimuli number change, for which a correct
response rate of 75% was achieved. The PSEs were
obtained as the values of the locations on the psychometric

1525

The fits of the data points to the psychometric functions
were generally good, and the Pearson product–moment
correlation coefficient exceeded .9 in most cases. The data
of three novice observers were not satisfactory fitted to the
psychometric functions, thus, we excluded their data form
further analysis.
Figure 4a shows the results of Weber fractions in each
distribution types. The precision of representing average
size appeared to be partly affected by the size distribution.
Figure 4b shows the standardized PSEs in each distribution
condition. The average size of the set of items seems to be
overestimated as compared with the comparison item in all
distribution conditions with the novice observers.
Novice observers To test whether and how the size
distributions affect the precision of representing average
values, one way (4 distribution conditions) repeated
measures analysis of variance was conducted on the
individual Weber fraction. This yielded significant main
effect of distribution, F(3,11)= 2.94, p<.05. Bonfferoni
Post-hoc analysis revealed that the judgment in Asym2
condition (positively skewed distribution) gave higher
precision than uniform, p< .05, and Asym1 (negatively
skewed distribution) p< .05 conditions.
In a similar way, to test how the distribution affected
the accuracy of representing average sizes, one way (4
distribution conditions) repeated measures analysis of
variance was conducted on the individual PSE. This yields
no main effect of distribution, F(3,11)= .554, p>.1. This
suggests that the accuracy of representing average size was
not affected by the size distribution. As average of PSE
seems larger than the 0, we conducted a one-sample t test to
compare the mean standardized PSEs of each condition with
a PSE of 0. The analysis revealed that the mean of the PSE
was significantly larger than 0 at the standard stimuli in the
uniform, t(10) = 4.99, p < .01, Asym1, t(10) = 2.63, p < .05,
Asym2, t(10) = 4.40, p< .01, and normal distribution, t(10)
= 3.30, p < .01. This suggests that average size were
overestimated as compared with the actual size in all
distribution condition.
Experienced observers To test whether and how the size
distributions affect the precision of representing average
values, one way (4 distribution conditions) repeated
measures analysis of variance was conducted on the
individual Weber fraction of the experienced observers.
This analysis revealed no significant effect of distribution,
F(3, 2)= .523, p >.1.
To test how the distribution affected the accuracy of
representing average sizes, one way (4 distribution
conditions) repeated measures analysis of variance was
conducted on the individual PSE. This yields no main effect

Discussion
We tested how the distribution of item size would affect
the precision and bias in the judgement of average size of
items in a set by observers. Four types of distributions,
namely uniform, negatively skewed, positively skewed, and
pseudo-normal, were examined. We predicted that, if all
items in a set were processed equally, the performance of
the observers in judging the average would be unaffected by
item distribution conditions. Our results demonstrated three
significant findings. First, precision was significantly higher
under Asym2 (i.e., positively skewed distribution)
compared to the others, among which there were no
significant differences.

Second, the estimated average values of the items in a set
were overestimated relative to the actual values under all
item distributions. Third, the accuracy and precision of the
experienced observers was unaffected by distribution type
when carrying out the averaging task.
The first set of results implies that observers may not use
all of the available information equally when assessing the
average value of the items in a set, which could be because
of two alternative processes. One possibility is that a limited
number of elements could be being used to calculate
average values. Another possibility is that all of the
information on size in a display may not be weighted
equally when judging averages. Instead, some of the items
could be being weighted more than others. The results
partially support those of Marchant et al. (2013), who
indicated that the difference in the component of the item
sizes affects the performance of perceiving the average.
The finding that overestimation of the average size
relative to the actual size under all distributions is intriguing.
Bias in the judgment of the average has rarely been
investigated, and no consistent pattern of bias has yet been
observed. There are two possible causes for the bias. One is
the observer’s perceptual saliency of large stimuli; the
observer may process the large items more attentively than
the small ones, and thus, it is possible that observers utilize
the information of larger items relatively more frequently in
computing the average size. Another possibility is that
observers may automatically give more weight to the larger
items than to the smaller ones, irrespective of their saliency.
The fact that experienced observers were unaffected by
distribution type suggests that they may process all the
items in a set equally when elucidating their average value.
These results support the idea that people can extract the
average size of a set of items without relying on focused
attention to individual items in the set. Taken together with
the results for novice observers, it is implied that how we
represent the average value may not be accounted for just
from a single process but from a variety of processes that
depend on individual cognitive characteristics. The
implication is somewhat consistent with the findings of
Haberman, Brady, and Alvarez (2015). They pointed out
that the mechanism of representation of summary statistics
may involve various levels of processes, and individual
differences may reveal those levels. As our data shows, with
a wide variety of item distributions, it is important to
explore the basis of those differences.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that average
judgement precision differs with distribution and the size of
the average value was overestimated by the observers under
all conditions. However, the results for experienced
observers showed that the performance of their judgement
of the average was unaffected by distribution type. Our
findings imply that the process of assessing the average
value may not be explained by a single definitive
mechanism but is rather mediated by a mixture of multiple
cognitive processes.
