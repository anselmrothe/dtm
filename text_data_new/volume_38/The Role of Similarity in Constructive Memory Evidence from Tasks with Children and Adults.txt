share a relational similarity. Even completely dissimilar
episodes could be blended, if they participate in a double
analogy, i.e. the target partially maps to these two dissimilar
episodes (Kokinov & Zareva, 2001, Zareva & Kokinov,
2003). Pavlova & Kokinov (2014) demonstrated that people
tend to blend analogical pictures in a higher extend
compared to superficially similar ones.

Abstract
Literature on memory research shows that when memorizing,
people may blend two situations, i.e. when memorizing one
story, they add elements from another story. Most of the
cognitive models assume that the superficial similarity
between two episodes is the primary factor for blending.
However, there is evidence that people blend dissimilar
stories as well, if these stories share the same relational
structure. We contrasted the two factors in a single study and
performed experiments with the same design and stimuli with
adults and with 4-5-year-old children. The results show that
there is no qualitative difference between the performance of
adults and children. Also, both adults and children blend
either pictures that have surface or structural similarity
depending on the abstractness of the objects in them.

The Role of Relational Knowledge in Human
Cognition
There is a lot of evidence that relational similarity is
probably a hallmark of various constructive processes.
Relational mapping is the fundament of various models of
vision and recognition (Hummel & Stankiewicz, 1998;
Chalmers et al., 1992; Petkov & Shahbazyan, 2007).
People’s understanding of social relationships and their
theories of other’s minds depend highly on their relational
knowledge (Day and Gentner, 2007; Shahbazyan et al.,
2014; Wittenbrink et al., 1997). Even emotions are probably
constructs that are based on relational coherence of various
signals (Russell, 2003; Gallagher, 2012, de Bruin et al.,
2014).
Analogy-making may lie at the core of human
intelligence and most of the other cognitive processes (Penn
& Povinelli, 2012, Hofstadter, 2001). This point of research,
together with the evidence for the role of relational structure
of episodes and situations in memory distortions of them,
naturally implies the hypothesis that the process of
relational mapping is a basic factor for the process of
construction of human memories. However, there is
evidence that analogy-making ability is not innate,
something happens during the 4-5th year of development, the
so-called “relational shift” (Gentner, 1988). Having in mind
that analogy-making develops during childhood, the
question whether memory illusions develop in parallel
seems interesting and promising.

Keywords: constructive memory; development; analogy-making.

Evidence for the Constructive Nature of
Memory
The constructivist approach became a leading theory for
human memory during the last decades. According to it,
people continuously create hypotheses about what has
happened in the past and verify them according to their
current knowledge and the current context (Neisser, 1967).
The subjective experience of recalling is the final product of
this process of continuous creation and verification of
hypotheses. There is a huge amount of empirical evidence
that suggests that people wrongly recall stimuli and events
that never have occurred (Bartlett & Burt, 1933, Roediger,
1996, Roediger & McDermott, 1995, Schacter, 2002); blend
episodes and misattribute the source of their memories
(Loftus, 1997, 2003, Loftus & Ketcham, 1992, Berkowitz et
al., 2008, Kokinov & Zareva, 2001).
However, the mechanisms of memory distortion are
questionable. Most of the models of memory blending
(Metcalfe, 1990; McClelland, 1995; Schacter et al, 1998;
Nystrom & McClelland, 1992) assume that the surface
similarity between two episodes is the only factor for their
blending. According to these models, the more similar two
episodes are, the larger the overlapped part of their
representation is and hence, the probability to blend them in
the course of retrieval is higher.
However, Kokinov (1998) reported a case of blending
between episodes that do not share common features but

Development of Analogy-Making in Children
A lot of experimental data during the last decades overturn
the Structure theory of Piaget (Piaget, 1977) according to
which children need to develop abstract operations in order
to be able to make analogies and this cannot happen before
12 years of age. On the contrary, it seems that even 4-5-

325

year-old children can make analogies as long as they have
the conceptual knowledge required by the task (Goswami &
Brown, 1989; Goswami, 1991; Vosniadou, 1989). However,
Gentner (1988) disagrees that accumulation of abstract
knowledge is a sufficient prerequisite for complete, rich
analogy-making. Instead, something in the basic cognitive
mechanisms must change; the so-called relational shift
should occur, i.e. the change of strategy children use to
judge similarity - they first use shared objects to judge it
before they use shared relational structure (Gentner, 1988,
Rattermann & Gentner, 1998, Gentner & Toupin, 1986).
Halford et al. (1998) agree that something dramatically
changes during the 4-5 year of child development but
assume it is just a quantitative increase of working memory
capacity. Bulloch & Opfer (2009) also oppose to the
necessity to generalize over types of similarity and assume
that what develops with age is the subjective judgment of
the predictive validity of different types of similarity. In
other words, when reasoning, both adults and children are
able to use relational as well as superficial similarity but
sometimes prefer different strategies, depending on which
similarity is relevant to the task.
Developmental changes reflect many cognitive abilities
simultaneously: children’s ability to manipulate relations
increases; they master high language abilities; they acquire
Theory of Mind, etc. The question what kind of memory
distortions occur at this age and what type of situations
children tend to blend is undervalued in the research and
deserves higher regard.

similar items more often than analogical or dissimilar ones,
whereas adults will blend the analogical items more often
than superficially similar or dissimilar ones.
Design. The experiment had a 2×3 mixed design. The
between-subjects variable was the age of the participants
and had two levels: adults or children. The within-subjects
variable was the type of distracter given during the memory
test and it had three levels:
Analogous – distracters designed by combining two
bases that share the same relations, but do not share the
same elements.
Superficially similar – distracters designed by
combining two bases that share the same elements and
thus are superficially similar, but do not share the same
structure, i.e. the relations between the elements in the
two bases are different.
Dissimilar – distracters designed by combining two
bases that share neither the same structure, nor the
same elements.
Procedure. The experiment was run on the E-prime
software and consisted of four phases that immediately
followed one after another.
First, the participants were presented sequentially with the
four pictures (called “bases”) from each set. Their task was
to describe each picture.
Then, they saw the four pictures of each set again but this
time simultaneously (see Figure 1). Adults had to observe
them for one minute. Children observed the bases and
received feedback from the experimenter about the objects
and relations in each base. The same procedure was
immediately repeated for the second set of four pictures, and
then for the last, third set.
In the third phase the participants performed a filler task.
Adults solved simple addition math problems for 5 minutes.
Children solved a puzzle for 2 minutes. The purpose of this
phase was to ensure a retention interval.
Finally, the participants performed a recognition test.
They were presented sequentially with pictures and were
asked to indicate for each one whether they had seen it in
the first phase of the experiment. Pictures were either the
same as the original ones (i.e. “bases”), or different, i.e.
distracters, constructed by combining elements from two
different bases. The recognition test included all the bases
and half of the possible distracters (see Figure 2), presented
one by one and fully randomized. After the vocal answer by
the participants, the experimenter pressed a corresponding
key on the computer keyboard. No feedback was given to
either adults, or children.

Experiments
We conducted a comparison study using similar tasks
and stimuli for testing adults and 4-5-year-old children. We
asked the participants to memorize sets of four pictures.
However, the sets were constructed in a special manner, so
that two pairs of pictures were structurally similar to each
other, another two pairs were superficially similar; and the
last two pairs were dissimilar. After a short delay we
performed a memory test about all pictures and measured
the amount of blending, i.e. false recognition of pictures that
were not presented but consist of combination of elements
from the presented pictures. Finally, we compared the
amount of blending between structurally similar,
superficially similar, and dissimilar pictures.
In the first experiment we used “rich” pictures with a lot
of salient elements that may attract attention, whereas in the
second experiment we repeated the procedure with “poor”
pictures with abstract geometric figures, and expected that
both adults and children would pay more attention to the
relational structure.

Stimuli. Three sets of 16 pictures were developed following
the procedure of Pavlova & Kokinov (2014) and used in
phases one and three. In each set, 4 of the pictures were the
bases, and the other 12 were the distracters. The 4 bases
were specifically constructed so that they formed three pairs

Experiment 1
The main aim of the experiment is to check whether there is
a qualitative difference between blending in children and in
adults. Specifically, will children blend the superficially

as follows: two pairs were structurally analogous to one
another (A1~A2 and A3~A4), two pairs were superficially
similar to one another, but did not share the same structure
(A1≈A3 and A2≈A4), and finally the last two pairs were
dissimilar and shared neither the same structure, nor the
same superficial elements (A1≠A4 and A2≠A3). An
example is shown in Figure 1. The distracters are designed
by combining elements from two bases and there were three
types of distractors depending on these bases – analogous
distracters, superficially similar distracters, and dissimilar
distracters (see Figure 2).

Figure 3: Distribution of “Yes” responses of adults and
children among the various types of stimuli during the
recognition test. The first column indicates the correct
responses, whereas the next three columns indicate blending
of various types.
Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of the “Yes” answers
for all conditions, i.e. both the correct responses for the
bases and the falsely recognized pictures for the three types
of distracters. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that
the main effect of type of stimulus was significant: F(3,90)
= 83.199, p < 0.001, (partial ŋ2 = 0.735). The main effect of
age was also significant: F(1,30) = 12.707, p = 0.001.
Children are more likely to give a “Yes” answer irrelevant
to what type the stimulus is. Analyzing adults’ data for the
distracters only, the pair-wise comparison showed that there
was a significant difference between the superficially
similar and the analogous distracters: t(1,11) = 3.752, p =
0.003, and between the superficially similar and the
dissimilar distracters: t(1,11) = 3.027, p = 0.012. The same
pattern was found for the children’s data. There was a
significant difference between the superficially similar and
the analogous distracters: t(1,19) = 2.904, p = 0.009, and
between the superficially similar and the dissimilar
distracters: t(1,19) = 2.774, p = 0.012.
These results suggest that the responses of adults and
children follow the same qualitative pattern: both adults and
children falsely recognized more superficial distracters,
which means that they blended the superficially similar
bases more often compared to the analogous and dissimilar
ones. Evidence in the literature suggests that object
similarity plays an important role in similarity judgements
for adults (Markman & Gentner, 1993) and children
(Gentner & Namy, 1999).
However, the obtained results differ from those in
Pavlova & Kokinov (2014) study. One possible explanation
is that the stimuli used in the two experiments differ from
each other. It is possible that the relations between the
objects in this experiment are more subtle and thus harder to
notice. Previous research shows that when stimuli are sparse
both adults and children focus on relational similarity,
whereas when stimuli are rich both adults and children focus
on object similarity (Rattermann & Gentner, 1998;

Figure 1: An example of the bases. The bases compose the
following pairs: analogous configurations (A1~A2, because
in both the subject holds the object; and A3~A4, because in
both the subject looks at the object), superficially similar
configurations (A1≈A3, because in both there is a bear and a
balloon and A2≈A4, because in both there is a rabbit and a
kite), dissimilar configurations (A1≠A4 and A2≠A3).

Figure 2: An example of the distracters designed for the
bases in Figure 1. Each of the distracters combines elements
from two of the bases.
Participants. The sample consisted of 32 participants – 12
adults (5 male; age 18 – 41 years, M = 26 years, SD = 7.5
years) and 20 children (10 male; age 48 – 63 months, M =
56 months, SD = 5.4 months). Children were recruited at a
kindergarten in Sofia, Bulgaria; permission to participate
was obtained from their parents prior to the study. Adults
were students at New Bulgarian University and participated
voluntarily.
Results and Discussion. The participants showed a very
good performance on the recognition test with 88%
correctly recognized bases for the adults and 93% for the
children. Since we are interested in the source of blending,
we analyzed only the answers for the distracters of each
type. The data are presented in Figure 3.

327

Markman & Gentner, 1993; Bulloch & Opfer, 2009).
Therefore, the more complex or rich the stimuli are, the
more shared object similarities there are, the harder it is to
notice the relations involved.
To test this assumption, a new experiment was
conducted. Experiment 2 followed the same procedure as in
Experiment 1, but with the stimuli used in Pavlova &
Kokinov (2014). The main idea was to see whether by using
more abstract stimuli we would obtain evidence for a
qualitative difference between recognition responses in
adults and children.

Results and Discussion. The results showed a very good
performance on the recognition test with 78% correctly
recognized bases for the adults and 94% for the children.
Since we are interested in the source of blending, we
analyzed only the recognition for distracters of each type.
The data are presented in Figure 6.

Design and Procedure. Experiment 2 followed the same
design and procedure as Experiment 1. The only difference
was that we used the stimuli developed by Pavlova &
Kokinov (2014) that consist of abstract geometrical relations
instead of attractive pictures of toys.
Stimuli. Four sets (one more than in Experiment 1) of the
original stimuli by Pavlova & Kokinov (2014) were used in
phases one and three of Experiment 2. Each set consisted of
4 bases and 12 distracters. The bases formed three pairs:
analogous, superficially similar, and dissimilar (Figure 4)
and there were 3 types of distracters depending on the type
of blending they represent: blending between analogous
bases, blending between superficially similar bases, and
blending between dissimilar bases (Figure 5).

Figure 6: Distribution of “Yes” responses of adults and
children among the various types of stimuli in during the
recognition test in Experiment 2.
Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of both correct
responses and falsely recognized pictures in the recognition
task. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that the main
effect of type of stimulus was significant: F(3,84) = 53.352,
p < 0.001, (partial ŋ2 = 0.656). The main effect of age was
also significant: F(1,28) = 15.238, p = 0.001, (partial ŋ2 =
0.352). Again, children are more likely to give a “Yes”
answer irrelevant to the type of stimulus. Analyzing the
adults’ data for the distracters only, the pair-wise
comparison showed that there was a significant difference
between the analogous and the superficially similar
distracters in favor of the analogous ones: t(1,10) = 3.860, p
= 0.003, and between the analogous and the dissimilar
distracters: t(1,10) = 3.068, p = 0.012. The same pattern was
found for the children’s data. There was a significant
difference between the analogous and the superficially

B2≈B4), dissimilar configurations (B1≠B4 and B2≠B3).
Participants. The sample consisted of 30 participants – 11
adults (9 male; age 23 – 33 years, M = 27 years; SD = 3
years) and 19 children (10 male; age 51 – 71 months, M =
60 months; SD = 3.3 months). Children were recruited at a

the analogous and the dissimilar distracters: t(1,18) = 2.163,
p = 0.012. However, this time both adults and children more
often gave a “Yes” answer for the analogous distracters,
than for the superficially similar and the dissimilar ones.
Thus, again adults’ and children’s results share the same
qualitative pattern but the results were exactly the opposite
compared to the first experiment – this time the blending
between analogous pictures was more frequent than between
superficially similar ones.

“rich”, complex stimuli probably attract more attention to
the concrete objects; whereas the “poor”, abstract patterns
make it easier for people to notice the relational structure.
Of course, another possibility is that the accessibility of
relations is better for the “poor” stimuli. The interesting fact
is that both young children and adults seem to use the same
cognitive mechanisms for this. Certainly, future work will
shed more light on the mechanisms of memory construction
and the role of different types of similarity in it.

Acknowledgements
People blend similar pictures as well as superficially
dissimilar pictures that share same relational structure. This
result is in accordance with previous empirical evidence that
blending cannot be fully explained by models that rely on
superficial similarity alone. Most of the models of blending
(Metcalfe, 1990; McClelland, 1995, Schacter et al, 1998,
Nystrom & McClelland, 1992) assume that the overlap of
the representations of the memories is the only factor for
blending. Potentially, these models could account for the
results; however, additional complications are necessary: the
relational structure of the situations should be added to the
representations, as well as mechanisms for weighting the
different pieces of knowledge.
The most interesting result from the current experiments
is that adults and children share the same qualitative pattern
of results. It seems that there is no discrete difference
between the cognitive mechanisms they use. These results
do not support the relational shift hypothesis (Gentner,
1988, Rattermann & Gentner, 1998, Gentner & Toupin,
1986). Of course, one may assume that the children in our
experiments have outgrown the stage of the relational shift
(it is a complicated task to perform comparative study with
same stimuli between adults and very young children). It
should be mentioned that most of the evidence for the
relational shift hypotheses emerge from explicit tasks,
whereas memory blending is an implicit phenomenon. In
addition, there is a small difference in the procedure in our
experiments between adults and children – the latter
received a feedback about the presented relations during the
second phase of the experiment, when they observed the
four pictures simultaneously. Additional research is required
for a precise conclusion but the results from the second
experiment definitely show that 4-5-year-old children are
able to use relational structures in their representations.
Moreover, relational structure may influence memory
distortions.
During the recognition test children much more often
say “Yes” compared to adults, no matter what the type of
the stimuli is. This could be explained with a higher
conformism, or trust to the experimenter, or searching for
socially desirable answers in a higher extend.
Finally, it seems that the type of blending that occur
more often depend not so much on the type of similarity
(surface or structure) per se, but on the type of stimuli. The
