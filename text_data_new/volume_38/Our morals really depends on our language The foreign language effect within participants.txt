Abstract
Recent research has suggested that using a foreign language
to present hypothetical moral dilemmas increases the rate of
utilitarian judgments about those dilemmas (e.g., Greene et al,
2001) and decreases incoherency between judgments in
framing effect tasks (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman, 1981; see
Costa, Foucart, Arnon, Aparici, & Apesteguia, 2014; Costa,
Foucart, Hayakawa, Aparici, Apesteguia, Heafner, & Keysar,
2014; Keysar, Hayakawa, & An, 2012). However, existing
research has mainly investigated this effect using betweenparticipants designs (i.e., different participants in the foreign
and native language conditions). Such designs are unable to
exclude non-equivalent conditions as a confounding variable.
In contrast, this study examined the foreign language effect
using a within-subjects design (i.e., all participants responded
to moral dilemmas (Greene et al, 2001) and framing effect
tasks (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) in both their native and
foreign languages. The “foreign language effect” was
replicated, excluding semantic non-equivalence between
language conditions as a potential confound. This result
supports the hypothesis that the foreign language effect is
independent of meaning.

Introduction
Language may affect individuals’ manner of thinking.
This possibility has attracted many researchers’ attention
since the famous Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was first advanced
(Carroll, Levinson, & Lee, 2012; Sapir, 1921). Languages’
effect on thinking has received much empirical study;
however, the discussion remains ongoing (for reviews, see
Kay & Kempton, 1984; Takano, 1989).
Recent work on the “foreign language effect” (Costa,
Foucart, Arnon, Aparici, & Apesteguia, 2014; Costa,
Foucart, Hayakawa, Aparici, Apesteguia, Heafner, &
Keysar, 2014; Keysar, Hayakawa, & An, 2012) provides
interesting data suggesting that languages affect human
cognition. In these studies, participants completed various
types of reasoning tasks including framing-effect tasks
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1984) and moral dilemmas (e.g.,
Greene et al, 2001) in either their native or foreign
languages.
The framing effect provides an initial demonstration of
the foreign language effect in reasoning (Costa, Foucart,
Arnon, Aparici, & Apesteguia, 2014; Keysar, Hayakawa, &
An, 2012). The framing effect causes equivalent
descriptions of a decision problem to elicit systematically
different decisions. This effect is robust and common;
however, it is reduced or disappears in decision tasks not
presented in participants’ native language. (Tversky &

Kahneman, 1981). For example, read the following vignette
known as the Asian disease problem (Tversky & Kahneman,
1981);
Recently, a dangerous new disease has been going
around. Without medicine, 600,000 people will die from
it. In order to save these people, two types of medicine
are being made.
Gain framing:
If you choose Medicine A, 200,000 people will be saved.
If you choose Medicine B, there is a 33.3% chance that
600,000 people will be saved and a 66.6% chance that
no one will be saved.
Which medicine do you choose?
Loss framing:
If you choose Medicine A, 400,000 will die.
If you choose Medicine B, there is a 33.3% chance that
there was a 33.3% chance that “no one will die and a
66.6% chance that “600,000 people will die..
Which medicine do you choose?
As you see, the Gain and Loss vignette describe the same
contents. However, participants who read the Gain framing
tend to choose Medicine A, whereas those who read the
Loss framing tend to choose B (Tversky & Kahneman,
1981). This indicates peoples’ coherence in risky choice.
Keysar,et al. (2012) demonstrate that this coherence in risky
choice decrease when people read and answer the framing
task in their foreign language.
Costa et al. also explored the foreign language effect in
moral thinking (2014). Intuitively, moral judgments about
“right” and “wrong” are the result of deep thought and
should therefore be consistent and unaffected by factors
irrelevant to moral reasoning such as language; however,
recent studies (e.g., Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley,
& Cohen, 2001) indicate that moral judgments are highly
context dependent. The most prominent example of this
contextual dependency is the difference between the switch
and footbridge dilemmas. The switch dilemma assumes that
a runaway trolley is headed for five people who will be
killed if it proceeds on its present course. The only way to
save these people is to activate a switch that will turn the
trolley onto an alternate set of tracks where it will kill one
person instead of five. Respondents must decide whether to
divert the trolley in order to save five people at the expense
of one. Most respondents indicate believing that one should

960

activate the switch (Greene et al., 2001). In the footbridge
dilemma, a trolley threatens to kill five people (as before);
respondents imagine themselves standing next to a large
stranger on a footbridge that spans the tracks between the
oncoming trolley and the five people. In this scenario, the
only way to save the five people is to push this stranger off
the bridge and onto the tracks below. He would die in that
case, but his body would stop the trolley from reaching the
others. Respondents must thus decide to push the stranger
off the bridge or to refrain; most respond that one should
refrain. Assuming that the imagined loss of life is morally
significant and the means to that loss is insignificant, this
discrepancy between the two problems’ response tendencies
illustrates the contextual dependency of moral reasoning.
Costa et al. (2014) found that this discrepancy varied if
the dilemmas were presented in a foreign language:
participants solved moral dilemmas, including the switch
and footbridge dilemmas, using either their native or a
foreign language; across three studies incorporating several
different languages, using a foreign language elicited more
utilitarian judgments than using one’s native language did.
This supported the hypotheses that affective processes
importantly affect moral reasoning and that using foreign
languages decreases affective engagement.
These studies’ results indicate systematic differences
between cognitive processing in native and foreign
languages; specifically, irrational decisions are reduced in
framing-effect tasks when choices are presented in a foreign
language (see also Costa et al., 2014) and moral dilemmas
more frequently elicit utilitarian judgments when dilemmas
are presented in a foreign language. Keysar, Hayakawa, and
An (2012) used dual process theory to explain the foreignlanguage effect (e.g., Kahneman, 2003; Sloman, 1996;
Stanovich & West, 2000). The dual-process model proposes
that human cognition is composed of an analytic, rulegoverned, and systematic system that employs many mental
resources, and an intuitive, affective, and heuristic system.
Keysar et al. proposed that using a foreign language moves
people from the immediate affective system to a more
deliberate, analytic mode of thinking (2014). Foreign
languages are less grounded in speakers’ emotions than their
native language is (e.g., Pavlenko, 2005), and are typically
processed less automatically than speakers’ native language;
this may lead to more deliberate cognition (Favreau &
Segalowitz, 1983). Such deliberate cognition might more
frequently elicit rational decisions. Additionally, foreign
language is more difficult to process (Alter, Oppenheimer,
Epley, & Eyre, 2007), possibly eliciting more analytic
decision-making. The foreign language effect aligns with
this suggestion (Costa, Foucart, Arnon, et al., 2014; Costa,
Foucart, Hayakawa, et al., 2014; Keysar, Hayakawa, & An,
2012; see also Nakamura, 2015).
Previous studies have examined this effect indirectly
using between-subjects designs; however, such designs
cannot exclude the possibility that their results partly reflect
differences between individual participants. Within-subjects
designs yield results that do not reflect individual

differences, confining comparison to the different
languages’ effect on each participant. This study therefore
aimed to examine the foreign language effect using a
within-subjects design.
Renderings of moral dilemmas in different languages
may not have equivalent meaning or significance. In
Nakamura (2015), Japanese participants responded to
various moral dilemmas either in their native language
(Japanese) or a foreign language (English) in two
experiments. Nakamura used factor analysis of participants’
responses to test the dilemmas’ semantic equivalence
between the two languages, and directly compared
responses to the moral dilemmas between the two languages.
In both experiments, a foreign language effect resembling
that of Costa et al. (2014) was observed in participants’
responses; however, factor structures varied between the
native and foreign languages, indicating that the moral
dilemmas’ meaning varied between the two languages. This
result implies that between-subject designs may not fully
capture the foreign language effect: individual differences in
cognition between the foreign and native language may be
large enough to change participants’ interpretation of the
dilemma between the language conditions. Earlier research
has consistently used between-subject designs; hence, their
results may simply reflect non-equivalent dilemmas
between language conditions, rather than languagedependent differences in moral judgment. Given this
possibility, demonstrating the foreign language effect
requires the ensured preservation of semantic equivalence
between moral dilemmas in native and foreign languages.
Differences in factor structure may not reflect individual
differences in the dilemmas’ interpretation; however, it
remains significant that differences between participants
might affect responses to the foreign and native language
conditions. Experimental design should therefore separate
language effects from individual differences to clarify the
foreign language effect.
Individual differences also affect interpretation of the
foreign language effect in framing-effect tasks; additionally,
the foreign language effect is apparent in comparison of
risk-averse responses between native and foreign-language
conditions: the difference in the risk-averse response rate
between gain- and loss-framed conditions in a foreign
language condition was smaller than that in a native
language condition (Costa et al, 2014). This latter result led
Costa et al. to conclude that using foreign languages
enhances rational decision-making (2014). Nonetheless,
attributing rationality to a participant requires that
participant’s judgment remains coherent throughout
equivalent gain- and loss-framed scenarios; hence,
comparison between participants does not directly indicate
framing effect-induced irrationality.
Excluding individual differences is thus crucial to the
examination of a possible relationship between language
and thought (e.g., Kay & Kempton, 1984; Takano, 1989).
To the authors’ knowledge, previous studies examining this

topic have not adequately determined if foreign and native
language differentially affect modes of cognition.
In sum, examining the foreign language effect using a
within-subject design would be fruitful for both practice and
theory. This study therefore centrally aimed to examine the
foreign language effect using a within-subjects design. In
this study, Japanese participants responded to moral
dilemmas and framing tasks in both foreign and native
languages.

A serious financial crisis has started recently.
Without any action, the company you manage will
lose 600,000 euro. In order to save this money, two
types of actions are possible.
In the gain condition, participants made a choice between
the following two options:
If you choose Action A, 200,000 euros will be saved.
If you choose Action B, there is a 33.3% chance that
600,000 euros will be saved and a 66.6% chance that
no money will be saved.

Method
Participants
One hundred and thirty-two undergraduates participated;
participants were compensated with course credits.

Materials and procedure
Seven moral dilemmas (including the Switch and
Footbridge dilemmas) and two types of framing task were
used. The framing task included gain and loss framing
conditions. Participants thus responded to 22 problems ((7
moral dilemmas + 2 framing tasks (Asian disease and
financial crisis) * 2 framing conditions (gain and loss)) * 2
language conditions (native and foreign)). All materials and
response scales were presented using booklets; participation
was compensated with course credits.
Following Nakamura (2015), moral dilemmas were
adopted from Greene et al. (2001). Dilemmas were
composed of three moral-personal dilemmas (viz.,
footbridge, transplant, crying baby) and four moralimpersonal dilemmas (viz., switch, standard fume, sculpture,
and speedboat) (Greene et al., 2001; cf. Nakamura, 2013).
Table 1 summarizes the dilemmas.
Framing tasks were adopted from Costa et al. (2014).
Regarding the Asian disease problem, this study used the
problem described in the introduction section. Regarding the
financial crisis problem, this study used the following
scenario:

The loss version was identical, except that regarding
Action A, “200,000 euro will be saved.” was exchanged for
“400,000 euro will be lost,” and regarding Action B,
“600,000 euros will be saved” was exchanged for “400,000
euro will be lost.”
Japanese versions of the moral dilemmas and framing
tasks were translated from the above English versions.
Regarding the moral dilemmas, participants rated the
permissibility of available acts on an eight-point scale (0 =
morally impermissible, 7 = morally permissible.) Regarding
the framing tasks, participants chose between the risk-averse
and risk-seeking options. Participants were randomly
provided with one of six types of booklet to record their
choices.

Results and discussion
Moral dilemmas
Figure 1 presents mean estimates of permissibility
judgments for the seven moral dilemmas in the foreign and
native language conditions. Permissibility judgments in the
foreign language condition were higher than in the native
language condition for the Switch, Footbridge, and Donor
dilemmas. Multivariate t-tests between the languages
indicated significant differences between conditions in mean

responses to the dilemmas except Switch and Hospital
dilemma (p >.20). Although this study could not found
significant difference in Switch dilemma, this trend was also
found in Costa et al. (2014). Thus, as a whole, the foreign
language effect was replicated in the same way as Costa et
al (2014). Notice that directions of the effect of language on
moral reasoning are the opposite in Baby, Sculpture, and
Boat dilemmas. Costa et al. (2014) proposed that using
foreign language would enhance engagement of the rational
system. However, these results did not match the prediction
by Costa et al (2014). These results suggest that direction of
the foreign language effect might depend on moral
dilemmas.
The following analysis was subsequently performed to
determine if the foreign language effect would persist
following control of individual differences. First, factor
analysis with promax rotation was performed using
maximum likelihood estimation. Table 2 presents
eigenvalues, information criteria, and fit indexes for one-,
two-, three-, and four-factor solutions. The data best
supported the four-factor model; however, that model
contained a factor without a significant load, and used a
somewhat complex structure. In contrast, the three-factor
model used a simple structure (Table 3): the first factor only
significantly affected responses in the Switch, Footbridge,
and Donor dilemmas; the second factor was only significant
in the Baby dilemma; and the third factor was only
significant in the Sculpture and Boat dilemmas.
Additionally, factor loads were significant for all items. In
sum, the four-factor model offered better data fit in the
exploratory factor analysis; however, the pattern of factors
appeared to support the three-factor model. The three-factor
model was therefore adopted.
Two types of confirmatory factor analysis were
subsequently performed (Table 4). One model assumed that
all dilemmas were affected by only one of the three factors
but that factor loads were not equal between the foreign and

native languages. This model represents non-equivalence of
the dilemmas’ meaning between language conditions. The
other model constrained values of factor loads to equality
between the native and foreign language. This model
represents the dilemmas’ semantic equivalence between the
two languages. The latter model fit the data better than the
former, indicating that the moral dilemmas’ meaning was
equivalent in each language.In sum, the foreign language
effect was replicated using moral dilemmas and a withinsubjects design; this design excludes individual differences
from potentially explaining the language effect; utilitarian
judgment was promoted in the foreign language condition.
Framing tasks
Figure 2 presents results indicating the foreign language
effect in the framing-effect task. Differences in risk-averse
response rates between the gain- and loss-framed conditions
were reduced when participants answered the framing tasks
in their foreign language in Financial crisis problem Chisquare tests indicated significant differences between the

Analysis also examined differences in coherence
between the gain and loss conditions in the foreign and

the percentages of participants who chose the same option
throughout the gain and loss conditions were calculated; no
significant differences were detected in participants’
percentage coherence between the foreign and native
language conditions in either the Asian disease or financial

language do not reduce tendency for incoherence in risky
decision making .

Figure 3. Response coherence in framing tasks

The foreign language effect persists in within-subject
experimental designs. Existing studies have commonly used
between-subject designs, which cannot exclude differences
between individuals; in contrast, this study’s design
excludes the possibility that the replicated foreign effect
reflects differences between individuals by controlling for
individual differences. Specifically, the results of this study
are important because it found the difference between the
native and foreign language conditions confirming the
equivalence in the moral dilemmas between the two
conditions. This study’s results are thus more robust of
those obtained using between-subjects designs.
Notice that this finding can be positioned as a first
example that demonstrated the foreign language effect in its
purist form. The foreign language effect indicates, lending
words from Costa et al. (2014), that the way of thinking
“depends on language.” This statement clearly implies that
use of language would affect way of thinking in the same
person. However, existing studies did not examine this
statement directly because of their use of between subject
design. Thus, we might say that this study is the first study
that showed the “true” foreign language effect.
Additionally, this study’s results imply that the foreign
language effect contains individual differences within
participants between conditions. This implication
importantly suggests that the interpretation of earlier results
apparently illustrating the foreign language effect may be

964

seriously confounded (e.g., Costa, Foucart, Arnon, et al.,
2014; Costa, Foucart, Hayakawa, et al., 2014; Keysar,
Hayakawa, & An, 2012). Further, this study detected no
change in participants’ response coherence between the
language conditions in the framing tasks. This result does
not support the proposition that foreign language reduces
the framing effect; instead, it suggests that the language
effect may itself be dependent on other factors, such as task
type or content.
Finally, this study’s results indicate that the foreign
language effect is unstable between decision-making tasks.
The foreign language effect persisted in moral dilemmas
following controlling for individual differences by using a
within-subjects design; however, the effect’s appearance
seems to vary between within- and between-subject designs
in judgment and decision making tasks, such as the framing
task. Additionally, results of the framing tasks indicate that
an existence of the foreign language effect depend on how
to define the effect. Hence, foreign language’s effect on
reasoning and decision-making appears to partly depend on
task type. Future research should therefore aim to determine
the relationship between the foreign language effect and
task type and illuminate the mechanism underlying that
relationship.
