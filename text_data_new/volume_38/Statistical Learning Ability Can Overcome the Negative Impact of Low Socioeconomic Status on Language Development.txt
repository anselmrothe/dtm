Abstract
Statistical learning (SL) is believed to be a mechanism that enables
successful language acquisition. Language acquisition in turn is
heavily influenced by environmental factors such as
socioeconomic status (SES). However, it is unknown to what
extent SL abilities interact with SES in affecting language
outcomes. To examine this potential interaction, we measured
event-related potentials (ERPs) in 38 children aged 7-12 while
performing a visual SL task consisting of a sequence of stimuli that
contained covert statistical probabilities that predicted a target
stimulus. Hierarchical regression results indicated that SL ability
moderated the relationship between SES (average of both
caregiver’s education level) and language scores (grammar, and
marginally with receptive vocabulary). For children with high SL
ability, SES had a weaker effect on language compared to children
with low SL ability, suggesting that having good SL abilities could
help ameliorate the disadvantages associated with being raised in a
family with lower SES.

Introduction
All typically developing children learn how to comprehend
and produce language, suggesting the existence of common
biological and/or environmental mechanisms for language
development. On the one hand, language acquisition may
depend on intrinsic factors such as mental and genetic
components (e.g., Chomsky, 1965; Crain & Lillo-Martin,
1999). On the other hand, language development may rely
less on internal factors and more on external interactions
with social and environmental contexts (Bronfenbrenner,
1979, 1988). The universality and variability in language
development suggest that a combination of these
perspectives might provide the most appropriate approach
for studying language development (Hoff, 2006). In
particular, it may be beneficial to study language
development in children by focusing on the interaction
between intrinsic (e.g., cognitive skills) and extrinsic factors
(e.g., social/linguistic environment).
Social environmental factors appear to be essential for the
development of language (Kuhl, 2010). For instance,
according to the “social gating” hypothesis (Kuhl, 2007),

social interactions influence learning in children by
increasing their attention span and, therefore, the amount of
knowledge retained from the environment. Social
environmental factors such as socioeconomic status (SES)
also impact language learning (Feldman et al., 2003;
NICHHD, 2000; Hoff et al., 2012). SES consists of many
components and each component could potentially influence
various aspects of child development differently. Primary
Caregivers’ education level and income are among the most
important indicators of SES (Roberts et al., 1999). Children
who live in low SES families are reported to have less
exposure to linguistic stimulation, which could
detrimentally impact their language development (Rowe and
Goldin-Meadow, 2009; Sheridan et al., 2012). In addition,
there is increasing evidence suggesting that environmental
factors can impact brain regions that are associated with
executive functions and language. For instance, the
prefrontal cortex in children seems to be strongly impacted
by their SES (Sheridan et al., 2012). Consequently, children
with low SES do not perform as well as children with higher
SES on tasks that represent cognitive control, memory, and
language (Farah et al., 2006).
Certain biological factors and cognitive mechanisms also
play an important role in language development in children.
Specifically, statistical learning (SL) abilities appear to be
essential for detecting and encoding structured patterns of
information in the environment, including language
(Conway et al., 2010; Saffran, 2003). Indeed, research
suggests that SL is a crucial component of language
processing in newborns (Saffran, Aslin & Newport, 1996;
Shafto, Conway, Field & Houston, 2012), children (Kidd &
Arciuli, 2015; Lum et al., 2012), and adults (Christiansen,
Conway, & Onnis, 2012; Misyak, Christiansen, & Tomblin
2010). Shafto, Conway, Field, and Houston (2012)
demonstrated an empirical link between visual SL in infants
and their subsequent vocabulary development. SL appears
to be used to learn the underlying patterns inherent in
linguistic signals, which facilitates the prediction of
upcoming units (Conway et al. (2010). In an
electroencephalography study, Christiansen et al. (2012)
reported that the same neural mechanisms appear to be
utilized for processing syntactic rules of language and SL.
Overall, these studies suggest that SL may be a prerequisite

2129

for language learning and that variations in SL can affect
language development.
In sum, language development appears to be highly
dependent on both the environment that the child is raised in
and his or her cognitive skills. What is not known is the
extent to which these two factors might interact to impact
language development. For instance, it is possible that
having better intrinsic learning abilities could help offset the
deleterious effects of being raised in an impoverished social
environment.
The specific aim of this study is to examine the
relationship between the neural mechanisms of SL, social
environmental factors, and language in typically developing
children. Specifically, we explored the possible impact of
SL as a moderator of the relationship between SES and
language development in children. We measured SL by
using the event-related potential (ERP) technique while
children were performing a computerized visual SL task.
We also measured children’s vocabulary and grammatical
judgment using standardized language assessments.

Method
Participants
We recruited 42 typically developing children aged 7-12
from the Atlanta metropolitan area with English as their
native and only language (age mean = 9 years; 25 male).
Four participants were excluded from this study, one due to
computer software difficulties during ERP data acquisition,
and three due to having too many noisy trials in the ERP
task (see EEG section below). The final analyses were done
using data from 38 participants (Age mean = 9 years; 23
male, 15 female; 13 black or African American; 18 white; 7
more than one race). Participants and their parent/caregiver
came to the Psychology Department at Georgia State
University for their laboratory visit. During their visit, both
parents and children were informed about the goal and
details of the study and provided written informed consent
and assent to participate. Participants were offered a toy,
worth $10 for participating. Additionally, the parents
received monetary compensation of $50 for the session.

Socioeconomic Status (SES)
Parents of the participants completed a questionnaire
regarding their socioeconomic status (SES) and
demographics. This questionnaire consisted of questions
about their individual and household income, education, and
demographics of the PC and secondary caregiver (SC). In
the analysis, we used average of both PC and SC education
level as a measure of SES. Each caregiver’s education level
was measured using the following scale: 0= Less than High
School, N=5; 1= High School, N=14; 2= Some college,
N=8; 3= Associate’s degree, N=3; 4= Bachelor’s degree,
N= 15 ; 5= Master’s degree, N=16; 6= PhD, N=5 ; 7=
Professional degree, N=10. Household income was not used
in the analyses due to missing data from more than half of
the participants.

Statistical Learning Task
The visual SL task was based on a task recently developed
by Jost et al. (2015), which in turn is similar to the classic
visual oddball paradigm, but with statistical regularities
embedded in the stimuli. We made the Jost et al. (2015) task
more child-friendly by making it into a game with a
background story (“the Magician task”). This task was
presented as a game on a laptop computer. In this task,
children were told a story about an inconsistent magician
who tries to make food for his children using his magic hat.
Children viewed a stream of flashing stimuli consisting of
hats of different colors presented with a black background
one at a time. Occasionally, a target hat with food was
presented within the stream. Children were instructed to
“catch” the presented food by pressing a button. Participants
were not told that hats of different colors each differentially
predicted the probability of occurrence of the target hat.
Each target followed a predictor in the sequence with three
conditions: high (90% probability of target following), low
(20% probability of target following), and no predictor
(target presented with no preceding predictor). Each
experimental condition (high, low, and no) contained 60
trials, for 180 trials total. Each stimulus was presented on
the screen for 500 milliseconds and was followed by a black
screen for 500 milliseconds. Six blocks were separated by
30-second breaks during which children watched a short
cartoon related to the magician story. Figure 1 shows a
schematic presentation of the magician task. It took the
participants about 20 minutes to complete the task after net
application. If children learned the probabilistic patterns
between each type of predictor and the target, it was
expected that there would be significant differences in their
response times (RTs) to the targets and/or the amplitude
differences of ERPs of the predictors based on whether a
trial was a high-probability (HP), low-probability (LP), or
no-predictor (NP) type. Either of these differences would be
evidence of SL1.

Electroencephalography (EEG) Recording
We collected EEG data measuring changes in electrical
potential on the scalp during the statistical learning task
using a 32-channel high-density EGI (Electrical Geodesics,
Inc.) sensor net and followed standard net application
techniques for the EGI system. EEG data were collected in
a sound-attenuated room. We used the NetStation 4.3.1
acquisition software (Electrical Geodesics, Inc.) to
transform and record the data to digital form. Before starting
the SL task, participants were instructed to sit still and avoid
excessive blinking. Data were acquired with a 0.1 to 30 Hz
bandpass filter and digitized at 250 Hz.
1 The no-predictor condition in the “Magician” task is the same as the
standard stimuli, which means participants saw it more frequently than the
high- and low- probability conditions; therefore, ERP responses to the nopredictor condition may be influenced by this difference in frequency of
occurrence.

Impedances were kept below 50 kΩ. ERP recordings were
time-locked to the onset of each predictor stimulus and
continued for 1500ms after onset for a total segment length
of 1700ms. In the no-predictor condition, the ERPs were
time-locked to the standard preceding the target stimulus.
After data acquisition, data from channels with poor or
noisy signals was replaced with data induced from
surrounding sensors using the computational MATLAB
software (version R2012b 8.0.0783; MathWorks).
Additionally, trials containing muscle activity such as eye
movement and blinks were removed using an artifact
detection process.

grammaticality judgement subtest of the CASL and PPVT is
100 with a standard deviation of 15 points. The participants’
average scores were slightly higher than average on the
grammaticality judgement and the PPVT tasks (yet still
within normal limits); but there was a wide range of scores
for both language tests.

Statistical Learning Measure
Based on Jost et al. (2015), who observed a P300-like ERP
component in the posterior region of the scalp in
conjunction with SL in the 400-700 milliseconds window
following the predictor onset, we focused our analyses on a
pre-defined region of 6 electrodes in the posterior region for
the same time window (see Figure 2). To assess the
behavioral and neural correlates of learning during the SL
task, we ran 2 one-way ANOVAs to determine whether the
3 probability conditions (high, low, and no) in ERP
amplitudes and reaction times (RT) were significantly
different from one another.

“Magician” Task.

Language Assessments
The
Grammaticality
Judgment
subtest
of
the
Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (CASL;
Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999) was administered as an assessment
of syntactic language development. In this test, a sentence
with or without grammatical errors was read to the child,
and the child was asked whether it sounded correct and if
not to fix it by changing only one word. This assessment
was administered in a separate room with a trained
experimenter after removal of the EEG sensor net. The
standardized scores of this test were computed based on
participants’ age.
Children’s receptive language was measured using the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition (PPVT-4;
Dunn & Dunn, 2007). During this test, an experimenter
showed the participants 4 pictures and asked them to point
to the picture that best represented the presented word. This
assessment was administered by a trained experimenter in a
quiet room before the EEG net application.

Results
The descriptive statistics of the language tests are reported
in Table 1. We used the standard scores for these measures

Figure 2: The map of 32-sensor EEG net with posterior region of
interest highlighted.

ERP Amplitudes Figure 3 displays the grand average ERP
waveforms in the posterior region. Visual inspection
suggests that there may be a late positivity roughly 400-700
msec for the high and low predictor conditions. This was
confirmed with a one-way ANOVA comparing ERP
amplitudes for the 3 probability conditions in the 400-700
ms time-window after predictor onset, which revealed a
significant effect of probability condition, F(2, 74) = 16.60,
p < .000. Paired-sample t tests with Sidak adjustment
revealed that the ERP wave amplitude was significantly
higher for the high-probability condition (M = 2.42, SD =
2.52) compared to the low-probability condition (M = 1.59,
SD = 2.39), t (37) = 2.41, p < .05, and no-predictor
condition (M = 0.28, SD = 1.94), t (37) = 5.19, p < .001.
The ERP wave amplitude was also significantly higher for

2131

the low-probability condition compared to the no-predictor
condition, t (37) = 3.60, p < .001. These results provide
neurophysiological evidence that children demonstrated
sensitivity to the different probability conditions, measured
by the EEG data, which is consistent with the findings of
Jost et al. (2015). These results suggest that as a group,
children’s learning of the predictor-target statistical patterns
was reflected by a larger amplitude for the high predictor
stimuli, and to a lesser extent, for the low predictor stimuli.

Correlations
The relationship between ERP amplitude difference scores,
RT difference scores, and language assessments were
examined using Pearson’s correlation analyses. The H-N
ERP variable (M = 2.11, SD = 2.59) was significantly
positively correlated with N-H RT (M = 104.23, SD =
100.71), r = .54, p = .001. Consistent with past research,
SES (M = 3.67, SD = 2.06) was positively correlated with
scores on PPVT (M = 111.58, SD = 19.20), r = .63, p <
.001, and Grammaticality Judgement test (M = 105.53, SD
= 13.42), r = .59, p < .001. However, SES was not
correlated with any of the SL measures (r’s < 0.3, p’s > .07).
Surprisingly, we did not find significant correlations
between SL and either language measure (r’s < 0.3, p’s >
.07). Partial correlation analyses with age as the controlled
variable, did not result in any significant changes in these
correlations.

Moderation Analyses

different probability conditions. High- probability line is on the top
(blue), low-probability line is in the middle (green), and nopredictor line (baseline) is at the bottom (red).

Reaction Times Similarly, the behavioral analyses provide
evidence of statistical learning. The results of the second
one-way ANOVA comparing RT in each predictor
condition showed that participants responded significantly
differently to the 3 predictor conditions, F(2, 70) = 31.04, p
< .001, sphericity assumed. Paired-sample t tests revealed
that the RT was significantly lower to the target following
the high-probability stimuli (M = 388.97, SD = 78.84)
compared to when the target followed the low-probability
stimuli (M = 465.08, SD =65.89,), t (35) = - 4.96, p < .001,
and the no-predictor stimuli (M = 493.20, SD = 67.59), t
(35) = - 6.21, p < .001. The RTs were also significantly
lower for the target when it followed the low-probability
condition compared to the no-predictor condition, t (35) = 4.18, p < .001.
Furthermore, difference scores were created for both the
ERPs and the RT data between the high and no predictor
conditions to explore the magnitude of the learning effects.
Because the target was preceded by a standard in the nopredictor condition, we used it as the measure of baseline
for both ERPs and RTs as it essentially constituted a
measure of ERP or RT that would occur without any
predictor. Thus, we defined SL by the difference between
baseline and high-predictor conditions. This created one
variable for ERP amplitude difference, high probability –
no-predictor (H-N), and one variable for RT difference, nopredictor – high probability (N-H). Note that for the RTs,
the difference scores were calculated to be positive since the
high predictor condition elicited lower RTs than the no
predictor condition.

Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to
examine if SES as the independent variable predicts
language outcome in children and whether SL ability
modifies this relationship. The predicting variables were
standardized (converted to z scores) prior to data analyses.
The results reveal that SL ability (H-N ERP variable)
moderated the relationship between the caregivers’
education level and grammar, R2 adj = .50, F(3, 34) = 13.13,
p < .001, and marginally moderated the relationship
between the caregivers’ education level and receptive
vocabulary in children, R2 adj = .45, F (3, 34) = 11.18, p =
.058 (see Figure 4). In addition, the SL reaction time for NH condition was a significant moderator of the relationship
between SES and grammar scores, R2 adj = .367, F(2, 33) =
7.75, p < .001, but not with receptive vocabulary, R2 adj =
.373, F (2, 33) = 8.33, p = ns. We controlled for potential
covariates in each model by including 3 widely-used
cognitive measures: Stroop (inhibitory control and
attention), Block Design (visuo-spatial memory), and Digit
Span (short-term memory) in each regression analysis
separately. None of these measures were significant
predictors of variance in grammar scores in addition to SL.
However, Block Design and Digit span tasks were
significant predictors of variance in receptive vocabulary
scores, β = 7.42, p < .05 and β = 7.47, p < .05, respectively.
In addition, we controlled for age as a potential covariate in
all analyses which did not result in any significant
explanation of variance in either language measure. The
overall effect that can be seen in Figure 4 is that SES has a
larger effect on language scores for the children with lower
SL ability; SES has a much weaker influence on children
with higher SL. This figure also shows that there is a good
distribution of caregivers’ average education level in our
sample.

a median split of the data.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether SL moderates the
known relationship between SES and language outcome. In
the SL task, children demonstrated different sensitivity to
the different probability conditions, indicating learning of
the statistical probabilities. The reaction time results were
consistent with the ERP results in demonstrating evidence
of SL. Consistent with previous findings, there was a
positive relationship between children’s SES level and their
language ability (Feldman et al., 2003; Hoff & Tian, 2005;
NICHHD, 2000). These results replicate previous studies
demonstrating a relationship between primary caregiver’s
education level and language development in children
(Stanton-Chapman et al., 2002). Children with more highly
educated mothers demonstrated better language skills in
both receptive vocabulary and grammar measures compared
to those children whose mothers are not highly educated.

More importantly, the results of the moderation analysis
revealed that children with high SL appeared to have more
robust language ability that was less affected by their SES.
In other words, the negative effect of low SES on language
appeared to be dampened by high SL ability. On the other
hand, for children with lower SL ability, their language
scores were much more sensitive to the effects of SES.
Thus, children who were raised in less advantaged families
showed more typical language development if they had
good SL skills whereas if they had low SL their language
scores were lower. These results are the first to suggest that
intrinsic cognitive abilities, specifically SL, may play a
moderating role in the relationship between SES and
language skills in children. The negative effect of low SES
on language is more apparent when a child’s SL ability is
low compared to when SL ability is high.
Results also showed that SL had a stronger moderating
effect for grammar compared to receptive vocabulary
scores. This distinction could possibly be explained by the
declarative/procedural model of language, which posits that
procedural learning and grammar share a common
neurological substrate (Ullman, 2004). Thus, it makes sense
that SL ability has a greater moderating effect on
grammatical ability compared to vocabulary.
It is important to mention that sample size of 38
participants may be relatively small for the type of analyses
used in this study, and so future research with a larger
sample size is needed to confirm the observed interaction
between SES, SL, and language. In addition, although up to
this point we have considered SL an intrinsic or biological
factor and SES an environmental one, it is also possible that
children’s SL ability may have been shaped by the
environment they are raised in while differences in SES
level could be due to biological or genetic factors.
In sum, this research provides an important examination
of the relationship between learning abilities, the sociolinguistic environment, and language development in
children. The results suggest that having good SL abilities
can help ameliorate the language disadvantages associated
with being raised in a lower SES home environment,
offering intriguing new ways to think about the relations
between learning, language development, and the
social/linguistic environment in which a child is raised. One
possible implication of these findings is the possibility of
designing intervention programs for children of families
with low SES. Recent research has demonstrated that it may
be possible to improve SL abilities through targeted
computerized
training
(e.g.,
Smith,
Conway,
Bauernschmidt, & Pisoni, 2015). Thus, by promoting SL
abilities in children raised in low SES families, it may be
possible to facilitate children’s development by minimizing
the impact of being raised in a less than optimal social and
linguistic home environment.
