Abstract
Humans can seamlessly infer what other people like, based on
what they do. Broadly, two types of accounts have been
proposed to explain different aspects of this ability. A first
account focuses on inferences from spatial information:
agents choose and move towards things they like. A second
account focuses on inferences from statistical information:
uncommon choices reveal preferences more clearly compared
to common choices. Here we argue that these two kinds of
inferences can be explained by the assumption that agents
maximize utilities. We test this idea in a task where adult
participants infer an agent’s preferences using a combination
of spatial and statistical information. We show that our model
predicts human answers with higher accuracy than a set of
plausible alternative models.

Introduction
As humans, we understand that other people have minds,
and we can infer what they know and what they want by
watching their behavior. Imagine, for instance, that a man
walks towards a cookie jar, opens it, peeks in, and then
closes it again. Although we cannot see the inside of the
man’s mind or of the cookie jar, we nevertheless suspect
that the man likes cookies, that he planned to eat a cookie,
that he believed there were cookies in the cookie jar, and
that he was wrong: the cookie jar was empty.
Our ability to infer other people’s preferences, in the
service of interpreting their actions and predicting their
future behavior, is at the heart of this ability. A large body
of work suggests that preference inferences rely on spatial
information. When we watch an agent navigate, a first focus
is on the path’s end state: Agents navigate to complete goals
that fulfill their desires (Woodward, 1998). A second focus
is on the path’s directedness: We expect agents to navigate
efficiently, and we use this expectation to attribute goals
(Gergely & Csibra, 2003). Thus, if an agent does not take
the shortest path towards a goal this implies there is a
constraint in the way (Csibra, Biró, Koós, & Gergely, 2003),
a subgoal that the agent completed within the path (Baker,
Saxe, & Tenenbaum, 2009), or that the actions themselves
are the goal (Schachner & Carey, 2013).
When we infer preferences, however, we not only rely on
what agents choose; we also take into account what they
don’t choose. Suppose that an agent can pick a fruit from a
bag filled with a hundred apples and one orange. If the agent
takes an apple, she doesn’t necessarily like them better than
oranges. But if she takes the only orange, then she probably
likes them better than apples. Intuitively, the second
situation reveals a stronger preference, even though the

agent could have chosen either fruit in both cases. In other
words, the strength of the preference inference depends on
the statistical information of the possible choices.
The ability to infer preferences using spatial and statistical
information are both at work from early in life. Infants as
young as three months old expect agents to navigate
efficiently to some extent (Skerry, Carey, & Spelke, 2013)
and show a robust expectation by their first birthday
(Gergely & Csibra, 2003). Similarly, the ability to draw
inferences from statistical information has its roots in
infancy and it plays a role in how we learn what other
people like (Kushnir, Xu, & Wellman, 2010; Wellman,
Kushnir, Xu, & Brink, 2016), how we learn about the world
(Gweon, Tenenbaum, & Schulz, 2010), and even how we
learn the meaning of new words (Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007).
Together, these two lines of evidence suggest a dual
system for inferring preferences: one that relies on spatial
information, and one that relies on statistical information.
But real-world situations do not break down so cleanly.
Agents usually combine both spatial and statistical
distributions of potential rewards in their environment, and
so should our judgments about their preferences from
observing their actions.
Here we propose that, rather than being supported two
systems of knowledge, preference inferences from spatial
and statistical information are derived from a single intuitive
theory of agents: the naïve utility calculus (Jara-Ettinger,
Gweon, Tenenbaum, & Schulz; 2015; Jara-Ettinger,
Tenenbaum, & Schulz, 2015). Critically, our goal here is not
to compare the naïve utility calculus with formal theories of
decision-making, but with other theories of intuitive
decision-making. Here we show how the naïve utility
calculus (NUC) supports inferences from spatial and
statistical information. We test our proposal by
implementing and comparing a spatial inference model, a
statistical inference model, and a NUC model against adult
performance on a preference-inference task. We end by
discussing the implications of our findings on understanding
the development of commonsense psychology.

The Naïve Utility Calculus
A growing set of studies suggests that humans reason
about agents in terms of utility maximization (Jara-Ettinger
et al., 20215; Jern et al, 2011; Johnson & Rips, 2015; Lucas
et al, 2014). Specifically, humans have an intuitive theory of
how utilities are comprised of costs and rewards, and how,
together, they guide what others do. According to this Naïve
Utility Calculus, agents act by estimating the costs and
rewards associated with each possible plan, and by selecting
the plan with the highest utility (the difference between
rewards and costs). That is, when people watch an agent,

2033

they assume that her behavior yielded high utilities, and
they use this assumption to infer the agent’s competence
(her costs) and her motivation (her rewards). To illustrate
inferences through the NUC, consider an agent who chooses
an apple over an orange. This implies that the utility for the
apple, U(a), is higher or equal than the utility for the orange,
U(o). By decomposing each utility into its costs (C(a) and
C(o), respectively) and rewards (R(a) and R(o),
respectively), the agent’s choice implies that R(a)-C(a) ≥
R(o)-C(o). If both fruits were equally easy to get, then
C(a)=C(o) and, therefore, R(a) ≥ R(o). That is, when two
options are matched for costs, agents choose what they like
best. Suppose instead that the apple, the agent’s choice, was
more costly to get than the orange. Because R(a)-C(a) ≥
R(o)-C(o) and C(a)>C(o), then R(a)>R(o). That is, agents
unambiguously reveal their preferences when they choose
the more costly option. Last, if the apple was easier to get,
then R(a)-C(a) ≥ R(o)-C(o), and C(a)<C(o). Under these
circumstances, U(a) (R(a)-C(a)) may be higher than U(o)
(R(o)-C(o)) because the apple’s reward (R(a)) was high, or
because the orange’s cost (C(o)) was high. Thus, when
agents choose low cost options their preferences are not
revealed.
Although its developmental origins are unclear, the NUC
is at work from early childhood, supporting fundamental
inferences by age five and with some aspects already at
work by age two (Jara-Ettinger, et al. 2015).

Inferences from spatial information
The NUC explains why humans are sensitive to spatial
information. Suppose an agent takes a sequence of actions
to complete a goal. If the agent maximized utilities, then two
things must be true. First, the reward must outweigh the
costs. Otherwise, the plan’s utility would be negative and
the agent could obtain a final higher utility by not acting at
all. Second, the agent must be minimizing costs: the smaller
the costs the agent incurs, the higher the utility she obtains.
In spatial contexts, cost minimization reduces to efficient
navigation. Thus, expecting agents to maximize utilities
implies that a path’s directedness and end state can help
reveal preferences. If, however, humans do so through a
naïve utility calculus, then, as the example above reveals
(see apple-orange example), humans should also be
sensitive to a third feature of spatial navigation: its cost.

Inferences from statistical information
Inferences from statistical information ultimately rely on the
assumption that rare choices reveal stronger preferences.
Although intuitive, the causes underlying this assumption
are unclear. The NUC, however, naturally produces this
expectation. Suppose that an agent can take any object from
a box. If she doesn’t have a preference, then taking
whichever object is easiest to get maximizes her utilities (if
all objects have the same reward, the option with the lowest
cost yields the highest utility). In contrast, if the agent
prefers one type of object to the others, then she will have to
incur a higher cost in terms of time, effort, attention, and
distance to locate the object of the desired category and to
retrieve it. The less common an object’s category is, the

higher the cost the agent must incur to locate it and obtain it.
Thus, retrieving rare objects suggests that the agent incurred
a higher cost, and, if agents maximize utilities, this cost is
only warranted if the reward associated with the rare object
is higher than the reward associated with more common
objects.

Computational modeling
If humans infer preferences using their NUC, then a
formal implementation should quantitatively predict adult
preference judgments. Alternatively, if humans infer
preferences through simpler ways, then simpler models
should predict human inferences with equal or better
accuracy. To test if participants integrate spatial and
statistical information through the assumption of utility
maximization we ran a preference-inference task with adult
participants and we compared their performance to five
computational models: our full Naïve utility calculus model
and two NUC lesioned models, as well as two alternative
models. These models are based on the proposals of how
infants infer preferences from spatial information (spatial
model) and from statistical information (statistical model).
Next, to test if participants infer these preferences in a
Bayesian way, we compared participants’ self-reported
confidence judgments with estimates from each model.

Alternative models
Spatial model The spatial model formalizes the proposal
that goals directly reveal preferences. As, such, it uses a
limited source of spatial information: the end state. This
model assumes that the distribution of choices an agent
makes matches her underlying preferences. For instance, if
an agent collects two red objects and one blue object, then
the reward for collecting a red object is Rred = 2R/3 and the
reward for collecting a blue object is Rblue = R/3, where R
is a constant set to 1 (changing the value of R does not
change our results as model comparison was done by zscoring model predictions. See Results).
Statistical model The statistical model is based on
proposals for how people infer preferences by relying on
statistical information (Gweon, et al, 2010; Xu et al, 2007).
These models were formulated in simpler domains than the
one we test in our experiment so we extended them to fit our
experimental design. Our model assumes that, before taking
any actions, the agent goes through a decision making
process to find objects that will give her high rewards.
Specifically, the statistical model assumes that the agent
considers one object at a time (at random) and decides
whether to collect it or not based on its reward. That is,
when the agent considers taking an object from category k,
she selects it with a probability proportional to its reward.
These assumptions imply that more common object
categories are more likely to be considered and that more
rewarding kinds of objects are more likely to be collected,
once the agent considers them. As such, selecting an object
from a rare category suggests that the agent prefers it to
more common objects that the agent likely considered
collecting first. In this model, the observer assumes that the
agent considers each object with uniform probability (if

2034

there are n objects, the agent considers each object with
probability 1/n).
Given the theory of how an agent chooses what to collect,
we use Bayesian inference to recover the agent’s
preferences given her choices. Specifically, because in our
experiment we use two types of objects (see Stimuli), we
use Bayes’ rule to estimate the relative magnitude of one
reward type over the other (with 0 indicating that the first
category contains all the rewards, 0.5 indicating that both
categories are equally rewarding, and 1 indicating that the
second category contains all the rewards), using a uniform
prior.

choices to preferences is done through Bayes’ rule with a
uniform prior over the possible distribution of rewards over
the object categories.
Full Naïve Utility Calculus The full NUC model assumes
that agents maximize utilities. Costs are function of the
number of actions the agent takes (set to be a constant cost
per action = 0.01; our conclusions are robust to parameter
changes) and rewards are exponentially discounted over
time. Intuitively, the future discount corresponds to the
assumption that the longer an agent takes to reach a reward,
the less likely the reward will still be there. Thus, this model
relies on spatial information in three ways: first, it expects
agents to navigate efficiently because smaller sequences of
actions incur fewer costs (minimizing costs), and because
collecting objects faster results in higher rewards
(maximizing exponentially discounted rewards); second it
assumes that the agent’s goals have sources of rewards; and
last, and in contrast to the alternative models, it assumes that
longer distances reveal stronger preferences. More formally,
the cost of actions and rewards in objects are integrated into
a utility function (U=R-C) and the utility-maximizing
actions are derived through a Markov Decision Process.
Further details about the computational implementations of
the naïve utility calculus can be found in Jara-Ettinger et al
(2015).
Future-discount lesion The future-discount lesion is
identical to the NUC model but rewards aren’t discounted
over time. Thus, this model integrates statistical information
in a full manner, and spatial information in a simplified
manner. The model expects agents to navigate efficiently
only because lower costs lead to higher utilities, but not
because longer distances increases the chance of losing the
target reward.
Action cost lesion Conversely, the action cost lesion model
is identical to the NUC but it ignores action costs.
Nevertheless, the model assumes that the agent’s rewards
are discounted over time. This model therefore integrates
spatial information through the expectation that agents act
efficiently because the longer it takes them to reach a
reward, the less likely it will still be there when they arrive.

Figure 1. Stimuli examples along with participant judgments and
model predictions. Because judgments are z-scored, positive and
negative values are relative to the average preference inference and
do not correspond to preferring red or green minerals, respectively.
The negative-valued prediction in this plot indicates a weaker
preference for red minerals compared to the average inference.

Naïve Utility Calculus models
The last three models are implementations of the naïve
utility calculus (NUC), but they integrate costs in different
ways, enabling us to understand how humans may reason
about costs, rewards, and utility maximization. All models
are formulated as generative models that predict agent
choices given their preferences, and the inference from

Figure 1 shows examples of the stimuli. Each stimulus
consisted of an animated display of an agent (the miner)
entering a mine (a 12x12 grid world) and collecting green
and/or red minerals. Each map contained 24 minerals in the
same locations (which were chosen at random and kept
constant across stimuli), but the proportion and the
distribution of these minerals varied. The proportion varied
according to three levels: more green than red (20 green and
4 red), more red than green (4 green and 20 red), or an equal
number of each (12 of each). The distributions of these
minerals varied according to three levels: red minerals
closer, green minerals closer, or all minerals intermixed.

2035

This generated a total of nine different maps. By varying the
proportion of the objects, we can test how statistical
information influences preference inferences; by varying the
location of the objects we can test how spatial information
influences preference inferences.
The miner’s paths were obtained by computing the
shortest path an agent would need to take to collect all
minerals of one kind, or to collect the closest minerals
(which could be a combination of red and green minerals).
These paths were generated in accordance to three
conditions. In the first condition, the miner collected one
mineral and exited the mine. In the second condition, the
miner collected three minerals in a single trip and then
exited the mine. And in the last condition the miner
collected three minerals, but had to return to the mine’s exit
after collecting each object. Thus, the first and second
conditions test how the amount of data an observer receives
influences observers’ inferences, and the second and third
conditions together test how the costs of collecting the
minerals influence observers’ inferences. The combination
of the two agent types (strong preference or no preference)
with the nine maps produced a total of 18 test paths per
condition.

Participant judgments

Participants were randomly assigned to the one mineral
condition, to the three minerals in one trip condition, or to
the three minerals in three trips condition (N = 30
participants per condition). Thus, each participant only
completed one-third of the trials. Participants first
completed a brief tutorial that explained the task. Next,
participants completed a questionnaire with three questions
to ensure they understood the task. Participants who
responded all questions correctly were given access to the
experiment, and participants who made at least one error
were redirected to the beginning of the tutorial.
In the test stage, participants saw an animated display of
the miner collecting the minerals and had to respond four
questions. The first two questions were multiple choice
control questions asking about the proportion and
distribution of the minerals. Participants who answered
these questions incorrectly were asked to re-examine the
stimulus. The third question asked participants to rate the
miner’s preference using a slider that ranged from “Red is
much more valuable” (coded as a 0) to “Green is much more
valuable” (coded as a 1). The last question asked
participants to rate their confidence in the preference
judgment using a slider that ranged from “Not at all” (coded
as a 0) to “Extremely confident” (coded as a 1).

Figure 1 shows four example trials that reveal how the
NUC outperforms the alternative models. The spatial model
fails to capture differences between trials A, B, and C, as it
is not sensitive to the amount of evidence. The statistical
model roughly captures human responses, but it attributes a
stronger preference to the miner in trial B, as it neglects the
spatial distribution. In contrast, the NUC models show
sensitivity to the amount of data, the spatial information,
and the statistical information.

judgments (correlation difference = .042; 95% CI =
(0.004,0.072)). This suggests that participants are sensitive
to an exponential discounting of the mineral rewards over
the length of the miner’s trajectory. Similarly, removing the
cost of travelling decreased the model’s correlation with
human judgments (difference = .022; 95% CI = (0.007,0.047)). However, 13% of the mass of the 95%
confidence interval was on the negative region. This
suggests that integrating a linear cost over the futurediscount may better fit human judgments, but the results are
inconclusive.

outliers revealed that they were all cases where the miner
had selected a combination of red and green minerals
(because of the way we generated the stimuli, the miner
only took a combination of red and green minerals
whenever these were the closest and the agent had no
preference; see Stimuli section). Consistent with this, we
found that when we decomposed the stimuli into trials
where the agent collected only one type of mineral (Single
category), the NUC model and its lesions showed high
correlations and performed roughly as well. In contrast, in
the stimuli where the agent collected various kinds of
minerals (Both categories), none of the models predicted
human confidence judgments (see Table 2). Nevertheless, it
is important to note that this subset of stimuli consists of
seven data points, making it difficult to draw conclusions
from the correlations.

Model confidence
Figure 3. Confidence judgments. The models’ confidence ratings
were obtained by computing the standard deviation of the posterior
distribution of each stimulus, multiplying them by -1 (so as to
match the qualitative order in participant judgments), and then zscoring the values. Participant confidence judgments were z-scored
within participant and averaged.

Our evidence so far suggests that humans infer
preferences through the assumption of utility-maximization.
Nevertheless, this inference is not necessarily Bayesian.
Participants may, for instance, approximate the responses
from a Bayesian models through simpler heuristics. To
explore this possibility, we asked participants to report
confidence judgments on each trial (see Methods section)
and we compared them with a rough measure of each
model’s uncertainty: the posterior distribution’s standard
deviation. If participants are inferring preferences in a
probabilistic manner, then the NUC’s standard deviation
should correlate with participant confidence judgments.
However, if participants infer preferences through some
heuristics that approximate Bayesian inference, then their
confidence should not necessarily be related to the one in
our model. Moreover, the statistical model, being Bayesian,
also produces confidence judgments (the spatial model
generates a single inferred estimate with full confidence),
enabling us to further test its validity.
Figure 3 shows each model’s negative standard deviation
along with participants’ confidence judgments. Although the
alternative models all captured preference inferences in a
coarse way (see Figure 2), their measures of confidence did
not resemble participant’s confidence judgments (see Figure
3). In contrast, the NUC model and its lesions predicted
with far higher accuracy participants’ confidence judgments.

Discussion
Here we reviewed evidence that, from early in life,
humans can infer preferences using statistical and spatial
information, and we proposed that these two types of
inferences are driven by the naïve utility calculus (NUC) –
our intuitive theory of how agents select their goals by
estimating and maximizing utilities. We tested our proposal
by implementing a formal model of the naïve utility calculus
and comparing it to other accounts that rely on spatial and
statistical information separately. Our results show that
adults were both sensitive to the spatial and statistical
information of an agent’s behavior, and that this variation
was best captured by the NUC model.
Critically, all accounts fit participant judgments
qualitatively. Thus, implementing formal computational
models was critical for generating precise predictions and
assessing whether they explained variation in human
judgments in a fine-grained manner. Our results show that

2037

the NUC model significantly outperformed the alternative
models at a detailed level.
In order to better understand the NUC’s performance we
implemented two model lesions. In one model lesion we
removed the future discount parameter (future-discount
lesion) and in the second model lesion we removed the cost
for traveling (action cost lesion). Critically, both model
lesions were still sensitive to the statistical information, and
they both expected the agent to navigate efficiently. The
NUC correlated with human responses better than both of
the model lesions, but this difference was only reliable when
comparing the NUC model with the cost sensitive lesion and
not when comparing it with the action cost lesion. Our
results suggest that a non-linear reward discount is critical
for how humans reason about efficiency. However, once a
model integrates a future-discount parameter, adding a cost
of traveling only produces a modest improvement.
Although the alternative models roughly predicted human
responses, a comparison of the models’ posterior standard
deviation (a measure of the model’s uncertainty) against
participant confidence judgments revealed strong
discrepancies. In contrast, the NUC and its lesions predicted
our participant’s confidence judgments for a large set of
stimuli (see Figure 3 and Table 2, columns 1 and 2).
Nevertheless, all models failed to capture human confidence
judgments in the trials where the miner collected a
combination of red and green minerals closest to the mine’s
entrance (see last column of Table 2). In these situations, the
NUC models were confident that the miner liked both
minerals roughly as much, and that she was therefore
collecting the closest ones. Participants made similar
judgments, but they were less confident. One possible
explanation for this discrepancy is that our model assumes
that the cost for traveling is fixed and observable, whereas
participants may not. Instead, participants may be uncertain
about how exhausting it is to travel the mine, and this may
lead to a confound in the miner’s behavior: she might be
taking the closest minerals because she likes all minerals
just as much, or because she finds traveling deep into the
mine to be very costly. A richer version of the NUC that
integrates uncertainty over the costs and rewards is needed
to evaluate this possibility.
Altogether, our results show that the NUC explains why
and how humans rely on spatial and statistical information
when inferring preferences. Empirical results show that the
ability to infer preferences from spatial information and
from statistical information arises in early childhood
(Gweon et al., 2010; Gergely & Csibra, 2003). However,
these sources of information have been studied separately,
and different accounts have been proposed to explain how
we draw these inferences. Our finding that inferences from
statistical and spatial inferences are unified in adults raises
two hypotheses about the development of this reasoning. A
first possibility is that the NUC is already at work in
infancy. If so, infants may use it to solve tasks involving
spatial information (e.g., Gergely & Csibra, 2003), and tasks
involving statistical information (e.g., Kushnir, et al, 2010).

A second possibility, however, is that the NUC emerges
later in life. Under this account, infants must rely on simpler
expectations about agents to reason about spatial and
statistical information (perhaps driven by two separate
systems of understanding; a spatial one and a statistical
one). If this is true, then the proposed explanations for how
infants use spatial and statistical information (formalized in
the spatial and the statistical models), may be correct and
serve as the bedrock for a richer unifying intuitive theory:
the naïve utility calculus.
