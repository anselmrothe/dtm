Abstract
Generic language (e.g., “tigers have stripes,” “girls hate
math”) is a powerful vehicle for communicating essentialist
beliefs. One way generic language likely communicates these
beliefs is by leading children to generate kind-based
explanations about particular properties; e.g., if a child hears
“girls hate math,” he may infer that there must be an inherent
causal basis for the generalization, which in turn supports
essentialist beliefs. However, it is also possible that simply
hearing a category described with generics elicits the belief
that the category is an appropriate kind to generalize about.
On this account, even if the generic is negated (“girls don’t
hate math”), the generic language might nonetheless lead
children to essentialize the category. The current study
supports the latter possibility, suggesting that even hearing
negated generics (“girls don’t hate math”) may still foster
social essentialism.

Introduction
The ability to organize entities into categories is a key
element of human cognition. Focusing on the similarities
that unite category members allows even young children to
use information about one member of a category to make
inferences about other members (e.g., if one dog is friendly
then other dogs are probably friendly too; Gelman &
Markman, 1987). People tend to believe that certain
categories, such as animal species, mark objective divisions
in nature, and that members of these categories share a deep,
underlying essence which gives rise to both observable and
unobservable properties. These beliefs, referred to as
psychological essentialism (Medin & Ortony, 1989), reflect
pervasive cognitive biases that appear early in development
(Gelman, 2003; Hirshfield, 1996). Psychological
essentialism is an important element of conceptual
development, helping to scaffold knowledge acquisition by
guiding children to focus on similarities between category
members (Gelman & Coley, 1990).
Children hold essentialist beliefs about only a fraction of
the categories with which they are familiar. For instance,
children and adults generally view animal categories in
more essentialist terms than artifact categories
(Diesendruck, 2003; Gelman, 2003; Gelman & Coley, 1990;
Rhodes & Gelman, 2009; Rhodes, Gelman, & Karuza,
2014). Likewise, children develop essentialist beliefs about

certain social categories but not others; the extent to which
children view a particular social category in essentialist
terms depends on the cultural input they receive throughout
development (Diesendruck & Haber, 2009; Mahalingham &
Rodriguez, 2006; Rhodes & Gelman, 2009). For example,
European American 7- to 10-year-old children growing up
in more politically conservative communities hold more
essentialist beliefs about racial categories than those in more
politically liberal communities (Rhodes & Gelman, 2009).
For this reason, social categories provide an excellent
window into how cultural input shapes essentialist beliefs.
An important form of cultural input that guides
conceptual development is language. For instance, labeling
objects with words leads preverbal infants to focus on
similarities and facilitates categorization (Fulkerson &
Waxman, 2007). Generic language – which characterizes
kinds rather than individuals, e.g., “tigers have stripes,”
“birds lay eggs” – is a particularly powerful linguistic tool
in
guiding
children’s
category
reasoning.
Children understand generics by preschool age (Cimpian &
Markman, 2008; Cimpian, Meltzer, & Markman, 2011;
Gelman & Raman, 2003) and they are common in childdirected speech (Gelman, Taylor, & Nguyen, 2004; Gelman,
Waxman, & Kleinberg, 2008), particularly in pedagogical
contexts (Gelman, Ware, Manczak, Graham, 2013).
Generic language is importantly related to psychological
essentialism. For example, parents produce more generics
for animal categories than for categories like artifacts, which
are not generally viewed in essentialist terms (e.g.,
Brandone & Gelman, 2009). Further, limited exposure to
generics leads to increased essentialist beliefs about novel
animal (Gelman, Ware, & Kleinberg, 2010) and social
(Rhodes, Leslie, & Tworek, 2012) categories. For instance,
Rhodes, Leslie, and Tworek (2012) had children and adults
read a storybook about a novel social category called
“Zarpies,” consisting of either generic statements (e.g.,
“Zarpies sleep in tall trees”), or matched specific statements
about one member of the category (e.g., “This Zarpie sleeps
in tall trees”). Subjects who heard generic statements came
to view the category in more essentialist terms than those
who heard specific statements. In addition, inducing
essentialist beliefs about Zarpies led parents to produce
more generic language about the kind.
Generic language is a powerful means of communicating
essentialist beliefs, yet how generics accomplish this has not

1541

been explained. One likely mechanism through which
generic statements increase essentialism is by eliciting kindbased explanations as to why the particular property is
generally shared among category members. Prior work has
found that children are more likely to expect properties
predicated in generic statements to arise from deep, kindbased causal structures, whereas they expect the same
properties predicated in specific statements to arise from
more idiosyncratic causes (Cimpian & Erickson 2012;
Cimpian & Markman, 2009; 2011). For example, when
children heard a novel ability attributed to a gender category
using generic language (e.g., “boys are really good at
leeming”) they were more likely to explain the ability in
essentialist terms, attributing it to inherent traits of the
category (e.g., “because boys are tougher than girls”). In
contrast, when the same novel property was introduced with
a non-generic statement (e.g., “this boy is good at leeming”)
they offered explanations based on individual effort (e.g.,
“because he got teached;” Cimpian & Markman, 2011;
Cimpian & Erickson, 2012). Thus, perhaps explaining
properties as arising from kind-based causal mechanisms
may lead children to develop a belief in a place-holder
“essence” or common causal mechanism for the category
members’ shared properties. For instance, if children hear
“Zarpies buzz when they are sad,” they might reason that
this property is due to an inherent shared nature, e.g.,
because Zarpies are not able to cry. Such reasoning may
lead them to intuit that Zarpies generally share a common
underlying nature that could potentially give rise to other
shared properties as well.
An alternative (or perhaps additional) mechanism through
which generic statements could elicit essentialism, however,
is by more generally signaling that a particular category is
appropriate to make generalizations about. By uttering a
generic statement, a speaker could simply be
communicating the belief that it is appropriate to generalize
about the category in question. As children depend on
cultural cues to determine which categories support rich
inductive generalizations (Diesendruck & Haber, 2009;
Mahalingham & Rodriguez, 2006; Rhodes & Gelman,
2009), generics may serve this function by signaling to a
child that a given category provides a strong basis for
generalizing. Notably, on this hypothesis, the specific nature
of the properties being generalized is not the primary factor
in explaining essentialist beliefs. What matters is that the
kind is being flagged as an appropriate locus of
generalization; the specific link between the kind and the
predicated property does not play an important role.
Crucially, these two processes need not be mutually
exclusive. It is quite possible that essentialist beliefs about a
category might be fostered in tandem both by cues that the
category is appropriate to generalize about and through
causal reasoning about particular properties. Importantly,
however, the relative weights of these two processes in
eliciting
essentialist
beliefs
imply
different
recommendations for how a parent or educator might most
effectively correct the generic statements that children hear

in their daily lives (e.g., “girls hate math”) in order to lessen
their effects on children’s essentialist beliefs. For instance,
if generics elicit increased essentialism primarily by leading
children to construct a kind-based causal framework for
particular properties, then negating the properties would be
sufficient to lessen the generic statement’s effect (e.g., “No,
girls don’t hate math). Such a correction clarifies that the
property is not generally associated with the kind,
presumably halting the need to generate a kind-based causal
explanation for the generalization. If, however, generics
elicit essentialism primarily by signaling that a particular
kind is appropriate to generalize about, then such
corrections may not be effective in reducing the tendency to
essentialize. That is, as the statement “girls don’t hate math”
is still itself a generic, such a correction may still leave
intact the implication that girls constitutes a rich, inductive
basis for generalizing. If this hypothesis were supported,
then correcting these statements to apply to a particular
individual would be a more effective strategy (e.g., “No,
only this one girl hates math”).
The current study tests whether negating generic
statements, and thereby hindering the causal reasoning
process, nonetheless elicits essentialist beliefs about a novel
social category. Is it necessary for children to believe that a
set of positive properties is associated with a novel category
in order to develop essentialist beliefs? Or is simply hearing
the kind treated as an appropriate locus of a generic
generalization sufficient? If the input does not present clear
properties about which to construct a kind-based
explanatory framework, do children nonetheless develop
essentialist beliefs when hearing generic language? The
present study focuses on social categories, as they are
particularly sensitive to cultural input. Children heard
generic statements about a novel social category called
“Zarpies,” based on materials used by Rhodes et al. (2012).
Children heard generic statements (e.g., “Zarpies have
striped hair”) uttered by one puppet, which were
immediately denied by a second puppet. Puppet 2’s
corrections were of three different types, depending on
condition. For a third of participants, these corrections were
in the form of direct negations (Generic Negation condition,
e.g., “No, no, no! Zarpies don’t have striped hair.”) Another
third of participants heard Puppet 2 offer an alternative
property (Generic Replacement condition, e.g., “No, no, no!
Zarpies have spotted hair.”) The remaining subjects heard
Puppet 2 correct only Puppet 1’s generalization to the kind
(Specific condition, e.g., “No, no, no! This Zarpie has
striped hair.”)
If generics communicate essentialist beliefs mainly by
signaling that a kind is appropriate to generalize about, then
both generic conditions (Generic Negation and Generic
Replacement) should elicit increased essentialism compared
with the Specific condition. In both generic conditions,
Puppet 2 does not challenge the implication that it is
appropriate to generalize across the category, only that the
particular property given by Puppet 1 is a correct
generalization. In contrast, in the Specific condition, Puppet

1542

2 challenges the generalization’s scope directly (by saying
that the property applies to just this particular Zarpie).
However, if constructing kind-based causal explanations
for particular properties is necessary for generics to elicit
essentialist beliefs, then only the Generic Replacement
condition should elicit increased essentialism relative to the
Specific condition. In the Generic Replacement condition,
children receive a set of properties to reason about (i.e., the
properties described by Puppet 2), whereas in the Generic
Negation condition, they do not know what particular
properties are held by Zarpies (as Puppet 2 negates all of the
generics stated by Puppet 1).

Method
Participants
Participants included 51 four- and five-year-old children (25
male, Mage = 4.91 years, range = 3.99-5.89 years;
approximately 41% European American, 9% African
American, 5% Asian American, 13% Hispanic, 14%
Multiethnic, and 18% unreported). Participants were
recruited from and tested at the Children’s Museum of
Manhattan. Written parental consent was obtained for all
participants; children provided oral assent. All study
procedures were approved by the Institutional Review
Board of New York University.

Procedure
The procedure was divided into three phases. In the first
phase, children were introduced to a novel social category,
called “Zarpies.” The experimenter showed participants an
illustration of four Zarpies, who varied by race and gender,
and said, “Here is a picture of some Zarpies.” The
experimenter then pointed to each Zarpie one at a time and
said, “This is a Zarpie.” Children were asked to repeat the
category name to ensure they had understood the
introduction before moving on to the experimental phase.
The second phase of the study contained the manipulation
by condition in the form of a short puppet show. Subjects
were first randomly assigned to one of three conditions.
They then watched a puppet show with two animal puppets
operated by the experimenter. The experimenter introduced
the two puppets as “Sally” (Puppet 1) and “Jenny” (Puppet
2) and told participants that they would be playing a game
with Puppet 1 where she looked inside a special box and
told the child what she saw. However, they were told,
Puppet 1 could not see very well and had forgotten her
glasses, so Puppet 2 was going to help her by telling her if
she got it wrong. To ensure children understood the
procedure, they completed a warm-up round in which
Puppet 1 mistakenly said a small blue bear toy in the box
was a yellow ball and was corrected by Puppet 2.
After the warm-up, children were presented with a series
of 16 generic statements about Zarpies from Puppet 1 and
corrections from Puppet 2. The statements were modified
from those used by Rhodes et al. (2012), and each expressed
a unique physical or behavioral property of Zarpies.

Children were first told that there were pictures of Zarpies
in the box and that Puppet 1 was going to look at them one
at a time and tell them what she saw. Puppet 1 then looked
inside the box and uttered a generic statement about Zarpies
(e.g. “Zarpies have striped hair”). Puppet 2 then also looked
inside the box and disagreed with Puppet 1 in one of three
ways, depending on condition. In the Generic Negation
condition, Puppet 2 corrected Puppet 1 by simply negating
the statement (e.g., “No, no, no! Zarpies don’t have striped
hair”). In the Generic Replacement condition, Puppet 2
instead provided an alternative property (e.g., “No, no, no!
Zarpies have spotted hair”). In the Specific condition,
Puppet 2 corrected the statement as that it only applied to
the depicted individual (e.g., “No, no, no! This Zarpie has
striped hair”). After each correction, the experimenter
moved on to the next statement by Puppet 1, followed by
another correction by Puppet 2, and so on. Subjects heard all
16 items in a row.
The third phase, following the puppet show, consisted of
questions that probed the child’s essentialist beliefs about
the novel social category Zarpies. Test items included two
measures of essentialist beliefs, modeled on those used in
Rhodes et al., (2012): three explanation questions, and three
inheritance questions (using a switched at birth task). For
the explanation items, children were asked to explain a
property that they had not heard about during the puppet
show (e.g., “Why is this Zarpie chasing a shadow?”)
Explanation content and scope were coded according to a
schema used in previous research (Cimpian & Erickson,
2012; Cimpian & Markman, 2009; Gelman et al., 2010;
Rhodes et al., 2012). Explanation content was coded with
intrinsic causes (“he loves to chase shadows”) as 1, and with
incidental causes (“he wants to catch it”) as 0. Explanation
scope was coded with category-based explanations
(“because Zarpies like to…”) as 1, and with individual
explanations (“because he likes to…”) as 0.
For inheritance items, children were told that a baby was
born to a Zarpie mother but raised by a non-Zarpie mother.
They were asked to predict whether the baby would display
three novel properties of the Zarpie mother, or alternative
properties of the adoptive mother, when it grew up. For
instance, children were told that the Zarpie mother loves to
eat flowers, but the other mother loves to eat crackers, and
were asked whether the baby would love to eat flowers or
crackers. Inheritance items were also scored for essentialism
using a schema from prior work, with properties of the
Zarpie mother coded as 1 and those of the adoptive mother
coded as 0 (Gelman et al., 2010; Rhodes et al., 2012;
Springer & Keil, 1989; Waxman, Medin, & Ross, 2007).
After each property, children were asked whether their
judgments were flexible, i.e., if the baby might also display
the unselected property. Inflexible “no” responses were
coded as 1, and flexible “yes” responses were coded as 0
(Rhodes et al., 2012; Taylor, Rhodes, & Gelman, 2009).
Participants’ responses were recorded on an answer form
by the experimenter, and an independent coder who was
blind to the study design coded explanation responses.

1543

Sessions were also videotaped, and a secondary coder
transcribed participants’ responses verbatim from video and
coded all videos for children’s responses. Initial agreement
between the coders was 87%, with disagreements resolved
by the first author.
A set of memory questions was included at the end of the
study. The questions differed across conditions and were
included in order to check that subjects remembered the
corrections from Puppet 2 rather than the original generic
statements uttered by Puppet 1. Participant responses were
scored such that higher scores in each condition represented
endorsement of the properties expressed by Puppet 2.

Children’s essentialist responses varied by condition

Generic conditions did not differ from one another. Relative
to the Specific condition, the Generic Negation condition

Hearing generic statements about a novel social category led
children to develop the same degree of essentialist beliefs,
regardless of whether the generics predicated positive
properties of the kind or were simply negative, denying that
a given property is shared among the members of the kind.
These results are a preliminary indication that generic
statements instill essentialist beliefs by signaling that a
given category is an appropriate basis for generalizing.
This interpretation does not preclude a role for kind-based
explanations in the development of essentialist beliefs.
Hearing particular properties expressed in generic language
may lead children to view those properties in essentialist
terms, even if it is not the primary means through which
generics increase essentialist beliefs about the kind in
general. For example, hearing a novel ability, e.g., leeming,
associated with a gender category may lead children to
expect that leeming ability is due to stable, fixed causes
linked to category membership. To take a real-world
example, hearing athletic ability associated with a racial
category might lead people to expect that an individual’s
athletic ability can be explained and predicted by his race.
Thus, generating kind-based explanations may play an
important role in the development of children’s (and adult’s)
essentialist beliefs that particular properties are linked to
categories (e.g., that athletic ability is linked to race), even if
generating such explanations is not critical to the
development of essentialist beliefs about kinds more
generally (e.g., that race is an essential kind).
One limitation of the current study is that children could
be interpreting the negated statements in the Generic
Negation condition (e.g., “Zarpies don’t have striped hair”)
as generic statements about negative properties (i.e., the
property of not having striped hair.) Future research is
investigating this possibility by more fully disassociating
properties from the category. In an ongoing follow-up study,
Puppet 2 completely rejects Puppet 1’s utterance: “No, no,
no! That’s not what this picture shows. That’s not right
about Zarpies!” If children are in fact interpreting the
negated generic statements in the current study as
expressing alternative (negative) properties, then children
should not develop increased essentialist beliefs about
Zarpies in this new condition. In contrast, if simply hearing
a generalization about the category is sufficient to elicit
increased essentialism, as the results of the present study

1544

indicate, then children should still develop increased
essentialist beliefs in this new condition.
These results also do not provide an exhaustive account of
how generic language communicates essentialist beliefs. For
instance, it remains unknown how much generic input
children need to develop these beliefs, and whether the
effects are cumulative across time. The generic input
children heard about the novel social category Zarpies in the
current design is very limited; children most likely hear
significantly more input about the actual categories they
come to view in essentialist terms in their daily lives. Future
research might investigate if and how these factors modulate
the effect of generic language on essentialism.
One interesting question left open by the current findings
is the extent to which a listener’s existing conceptual
structure interacts with the minimal category information
offered in the current study. For instance, Gelman et al.
(2010) found that hearing a series of generic statements
about a novel animal category lead to increased essentialist
beliefs about the category in both children and adults.
Children and adults generally hold high levels of essentialist
beliefs about animal kinds and these beliefs are less
dependent on cultural input than social categories (Rhodes
& Gelman, 2009). Would minimally informative generics
like those used in the current study be even more powerful
in eliciting essentialist beliefs about these categories given
children’s existing essentialist expectations?
In a similar vein, would adults – who hold more
established conceptual structure – be equally sensitive to the
minimal generics used in the current study? Prior research
has shown adults to be susceptible to generic language in
developing essentialist beliefs about novel categories, both
biological (Gelman et al., 2010) and social (Rhodes et al.,
2012). Future research might investigate whether adults, like
children, develop these beliefs even if the specific properties
expressed in the generic statements are negated. Rhodes et
al. (2012) found that adults gave more essentialist responses
than children after hearing generic language about Zarpies.
Thus, it is possible that adults require even less input than
children to develop essentialist beliefs, perhaps due to a
more robust expectation that the social world consists of
essential kinds.
A more detailed understanding of the ways in which
subtle linguistic cues foster the development of essentialist
beliefs is of great social importance. Though psychological
essentialism can be a powerful tool for learning about
regularities in one’s environment, viewing certain types of
categories, like race and gender, in essentialist terms can
have pernicious consequences. Essentialist beliefs about
social categories can facilitate social stereotyping and
prejudice (Gelman, Heyman, & Legare, 2007; Haslam,
Rothschild, & Ernst, 2002; Hirschfield, 1996; Keller, 2005;
Leslie, 2008, 2013; Prentice & Miller, 2007). For example,
children who hold essentialist beliefs about gender might
believe that if one girl is bad at math, then girls in general
are probably bad at math (Haslam et al., 2002; Leslie,
2013). Understanding how corrections to generic statements

lessen their effect on essentialism implies possible strategies
for counteracting stereotyping and prejudice. Based on the
current findings, simply negating a generic statement may
not be very effective, while correcting the scope of the
statement from generic to specific may be more potent.
One reason generic language may have such a powerful
effect on the development of stereotypes is that simply
negating them is not sufficient to undermine their influence.
Thus, hearing a negated generic statement (“girls don’t hate
math”) can nonetheless lead children to conceptualize
gender in more essentialist terms. By uttering even a
negated generic statement about girls a speaker is
communicating the view that gender is a valid category for
generalizations. The present results indicate that this alone is
sufficient to elicit increased essentialist beliefs.
