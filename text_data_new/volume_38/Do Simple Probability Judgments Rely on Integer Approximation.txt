Abstract

(Denison, Reed & Xu, 2012). These powerful reasoning
abilities continue to develop in infancy with older infants
making increasingly sophisticated probabilistic judgments
about their environment (Denison & Xu, 2009; Gweon,
Tenenbaum & Schulz, 2010). As children grow, their
judgments about probability become more and more
accurate (Piaget & Inhelder, 1975).
Recently, Falk,
Yudilevich, Assouline & Elstein (2012) found that young
children’s judgments about simple probability based on
proportion are influenced more by the number of favorable
events rather than the proportion of favorable to unfavorable
events but around 7-8 years of age this changes and children
adopt a proportional strategy similar to those used by adults.
Based on these findings it seems reasonable to assume that
children’s improving sense of probability is related to
improvements in general number reasoning.

A great deal of research has been conducted on how humans
reason about probability, yet it remains unknown what mental
computations support this ability. Research on the
development of the Approximate Number Sense (ANS) has
shown that performance in a magnitude (i.e., estimations of
integers) discrimination task is well fit by a psychophysical
model (Halberda & Feigenson, 2008). Whether or not
estimations of integers plays a role in probability judgments
has yet to be investigated. In the present study we use data
from two adult experiments as well as results from
comparisons of two computational models to investigate the
potential relationship between the ANS and probability
judgments.

The Approximate Number Sense

Introduction
Although classic findings in the literature on probabilistic
reasoning indicate that adults perform poorly on a wide
range of problems involving complex probability (see
Kahneman, 2011, for a review), a great deal of evidence
suggests that even young children and infants are adept at
making correct judgments about simple probability based on
proportion (e.g., Denison, Reed, & Xu, 2013; Piaget &
Inhelder, 1975).
Despite the vast literature on the
development of probabilistic reasoning, very little research
has been conducted on how these computations are made. In
what follows we review findings from research on the
development of probabilistic reasoning as well as research
on the approximate number sense (ANS) and present
findings from two experiments designed to investigate the
role of the ANS in adults’ judgments about probability
based on proportion. We then compare two models
proposed to predict probability judgments based on
proportion in order to understand the computational process
that underlies probability judgments.

Development of Probabilistic Reasoning
Recent evidence suggests that even infants possess
powerful statistical reasoning abilities which allow them to
predict the outcome of probabilistic events. Researchers
have shown that 8-month old infants form expectations
about relationships between samples and populations of
objects (Xu & Garcia, 2008) and infants as young as 6.5
months expect samples to reflect the ratios of the
populations from which those samples were obtained

Several research teams have shown that both humans and
non-human primates have a sophisticated system for making
rapid judgments about large and small sets of objects
(Whalen, Gallistel & Gelman, 1999; Feigenson, Carey &
Hauser 2002, Pica, Lemer, Izard & Dehaene, 2004;
Halberda & Feigenson, 2008). This has been termed the
Approximate Number Sense (ANS) and has been studied by
testing participants’ ability to discriminate between two
different sets of objects that vary in the magnitude of the
difference between the two sets. Several of these studies
have found that the acuity of the ANS improves with age
and can be characterized by Weber’s Law (Halberda &
Feigenson, 2008; Pica et al. 2004; Whalen et al. 1999).
Accordingly, the ANS is characterized by ratio dependence,
meaning that the ability to discriminate between two sets is
dependent on the ratio of the magnitudes of those sets.
While there is evidence to suggest that ANS acuity is
related to mathematical ability (Halberda, Mazzocco &
Feigenson, 2008), some recent evidence has shown that
ANS acuity may not influence probabilistic judgments
(Patalano, Saltiel, Machlin & Barth, 2015; Winman et al.
2014). Furthermore, some researchers have proposed that
rational number reasoning may rely on a set of neural
computations that are distinct from that of the ANS (Jacob,
Valentin & Neider, 2012). However, it is possible that the
computation of rational number comparisons such as
proportion and probability, relies on integer estimates. For
this reason, it is important to understand the computational
process involved in accurate judgments about probability.

Experiment 1: Evaluating Proportions.
Do adults use the approximate number system to reason
about the difference between two proportions? To answer
this question, we devised a computer-based experiment in
which participants are presented with two distributions of
red and white marbles and asked to pick the distribution that
was most likely to yield a target color marble. If the ANS is
recruited when making judgments about probability, then
ANS acuity should be negatively correlated with
performance on a two-alternative forced-choice task
requiring the judgment of probability based on proportion.
Additionally, as predicted by Weber’s Law, there should be
an effect of the distance between the ratios of compared
proportions.
Finally, if adults are making accurate
judgments their responses should be based on the proportion
of favorable to non-favorable events rather than the total
number of favorable events.

Methods
The methods reported below were originally designed for
a study involving young children and for this reason the
methods were presented to adults in a child-friendly manner.
Only the data from adults is presented below as we are still
collecting data from 6- to 12-year-old children.
Participants Forty-eight adult undergraduates (Mean age:
22.62; 37 female) from Psychology classes at UC Berkeley
were recruited for participation in this study.
Measures & Stimuli Images were designed using Blender
2.72, 3D animation software (http://www.blender.org/) and
consisted of two groups of red and white marbles separated
by a black partition. The proportions used are presented in
Table 1. All images were presented on a MacBook Pro
laptop (OSX; 1280 x 800) using the MatLab programing
language with psychToolbox (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997;
Kleiner et al, 2007). In order to measure the acuity of
participants’ approximate number sense, participants played
Panamath a game designed to measure the acuity of the
ANS (http://panamath.org/) for 10 minutes after the
probability task.

Procedure Participants sat about 60 centimeters from the
laptop on which the probability game and Panamath task
were presented. On the initial screen, participants saw a Big
Bird character with two bags on either side and were told
that Big Bird really likes red marbles. They were then told
that Big Bird is going to close his eyes and take a marble
from one of two groups of marbles. Their job was to tell

Big Bird which group to take a marble from to help him
collect as many of his favorite color marbles as possible.
Participants then played four practice trials in which they
saw a group of red marbles on one side and a group of white
marbles on the other side.
Two types of trials were used for each ratio of ratios listed
in Table 1. On ‘total equal’ trials both groups of marbles
contained 100 marbles while on ‘target equal’ trials the
number of Big Bird’s favorite color marbles in each group
was equal. See Figure 1 for an example image of the two
trial types. If participants are using a strategy based on
choosing the distribution with the greatest amount of
favorable marbles, they should perform at around chance
levels on target equal trials.
All of the images were presented on screen for 500ms in
order to prevent participants from counting the marbles.
Participants played the game for 40 trials presented in one
of two orders for both red and white target colors. Trial
order and target color were counterbalanced across subjects.
Adults participants were told that the game was originally
made for young children and therefore used a lot of child
friendly language.

Results
Analyses of general performance revealed the average
percentage correct to be 94.9% (SD = 0.04%) and this was
significantly greater than that expected by chance (t = 64.93,
df = 47, p < .001). The average Weber Fraction (WF) for
the 301 adults tested on Panamath was 0.162 (SD = 0.0058).
Importantly, WF was not statistically significantly
correlated with general performance in the probability game
(Pearson’s r = -0.32, t = -1.8036, df = 28, p = .082).
Generalized Linear Models with Mixed effects (GLMMs)
were used to predict performance based on age, ratio of
ratios, and trial type with participant entered as a random
effect and found no main effect or interaction effects for
gender, trial order or target color. The model predicting
performance based on the ratio of ratios and trial type with
an interaction (AICRR*trial = 772.04) outperformed the null
model (AICnull = 837.15) (χ2 = 71.105, df = 3, p < .001), the

performance by trial type and ratio of ratios is plotted in
Figure 2.
Analysis of the coefficients revealed that as the ratio of
ratios increased the chances of a correct response increased
by 4%. The chance of a correct response on total equal
trials was 88% less likely than for target equal trials and the
effect of ratio of ratios was 4.9 times greater for total equal
trials than for target equal trials.

Discussion
These results suggest that the ANS may not be used in
judgments of probability based on proportion: there was not
a statistically significant correlation between participants’
Weber fraction and general performance in the probability
discrimination task, with a sample size (n = 30) where a
large effect (r > 0.5) would have been detected (Cohen,
1988). Interestingly, there was an effect of ratio of ratios on
performance in this task and this effect was in the expected
direction: as the ratio of ratios increases so did performance,
a finding that mirrors the distance effect reported in the
ANS literature.
The GLMMs also revealed that performance improved on
trials in which the number or target marbles is equal
suggesting that participants’ judgments were influenced by
the number of favorable marbles. However, it should be
noted that performance on both target equal and total equal
trials was significantly above chance indicating that
participants did not adopt a strategy based solely on the
number of favorable marbles but rather that performance
was enhanced on trials in which the target number of
marbles was equal indicating that some participants may
have adopted a strategy of avoiding the choice with the most
red on some trials.
Several questions arise in response to these findings.
First, and most importantly, it is interesting that there was

no significant correlation with ANS acuity but it remains
unknown if this is true of children as well. It is possible that
adults have learned a non-numerical strategy and therefore
no longer use their ANS when making probabilistic
judgments. Future research will investigate the influence of
ANS acuity on children’s probability judgments. Second,
the astute reader will notice that the ratio of ratios that were
used in Experiment 1 were mostly comparisons of favorable
(above 50% chance) distributions to unfavorable (below
50% chance) distributions. It seems likely that different
results may be found when comparing favorable
distributions to other favorable distributions as well as
comparing unfavorable to other unfavorable distributions.
Another issue with the design of Experiment 1 arises from
the analysis of trial type in which there was enhanced
performance for target equal trials. Using the current design
it is impossible to tell if participants were relying solely on
approximations of either target or non-target marbles or
whether they were reasoning about the proportion of target
to non-target marbles. Trials in which the distribution with a
lower proportion actually has a higher number of favorable
marbles would show such an effect. Finally, it is impossible
to tell to what extent participants’ judgments are influenced
by the proportion of area of the two colors rather than the
proportion of the number of marbles, given that all the
marbles were the same size. Considering the lack of
correlation with ANS acuity in the adult sample, it is
possible that participants are making proportional judgments
based on area rather than numerosity. Each of these points is
addressed by design modifications made in Experiment 2.

Experiment 2: Area, number & chance.
Several changes were made to the design of Experiment 2
in order to address the potential limitations of Experiment 1
and explore the possibility that participants are not
recruiting the ANS when making judgments but are instead
using other possible alternative strategies. The results we
present here constitute pilot data for a more comprehensive
study. The full version of the study will include more trials
with a wider range of ratio comparisons.

Methods
Participants 19 undergraduates (Mean age: 21 years (SD =
1.94 years); 14 female) enrolled in psychology classes at
U.C. Berkeley participated in this experiment.
Measures & Stimuli New ratio of ratios comparisons were
chosen to include favorable vs unfavorable (F:U), favorable
vs favorable (F:F), favorable vs 50% chance (F:C), 50%
chance vs unfavorable (C:U), and unfavorable vs
unfavorable (U:U) comparisons similar to Drucker, Rossa
and Brannon (2016).
Three trial types were used for each of the ratio of ratios.
On ‘total equal’ trials the total number of marbles in both
distributions was equal while on ‘number vs proportion’
trials there were more favorable marbles in the distribution
with the lower proportion. As in Halberda and Feigenson

1010

(2008), ‘area anti-correlated’ trials included larger favorable
marbles in the lower proportion distribution and smaller
favorable marbles in the higher proportion distribution such
that the proportion of area of favorable color in the lower
proportion distribution was equal to the proportion of the
number of marbles in the higher proportion distribution and
vice versa. See Figure 3 for example images of trial types.

type (AICRR+trial = 580.4) (χ2 = 8.07, df = 2, p = .018).
Gender, age, comparison category, trial order and target
color were not significant predictors of performance.
Analyses of the coefficients of the superior model
revealed that as the ratio of ratios increased participants
were more than twice as likely to make a correct choice.
Both the number vs proportion and the area anti-correlated
trials had a negative effect on the likelihood of a correct
response with number vs proportion trials decreasing the
chances of a correct response by 93.2% and area anticorrelated trials by 12.7%. Interestingly, the interaction
terms indicated that the effect of ratio of ratios increased by
4% for number vs proportion trials and decreased by 52.4%
for area anti-correlated trials.

Procedure Images were presented using the same procedure
as in Experiment 1 and the instructions were exactly the
same except that participants were no longer asked to help
Big Bird but instead were asked to choose the box most
likely to yield a red marble. During practice trials
participants were shown that the trays containing the
marbles were dumped into two different boxes which were
then shaken up. This was done in order to reduce the use of
spatial cues that could influence the participant’s selection.
box they chose would tip over and dispense a single marble.
Participants were also told that the size of the marble did not
matter and the large marbles are just as likely to fall out of
the box as small marbles. Finally, participants played the
Panamath game after the probability task for 10 minutes in
order to measure their ANS acuity.

Results
Participants’ average performance is presented in figure
4. Mean overall percentage correct was 70.3% (SD =
14.9%), and this was significantly better than chance (t =
5.936, df = 18, p < .001)). The average Weber Fraction
(WF) as measured by Panamath was 0.156 (SD = 0.029) and
participant’s WF was not statistically significantly
correlated with general performance in the probability game
(Pearson’s r = -0.39, t = -1.762, df = 17, p = .096).
As with Experiment 1, GLMMs were used for the
analyses. Model comparisons revealed that the model with
the best fit was that which predicted performance based on
ratio of ratios, trial type, and the interactions between ratio
of ratios and trial type (AICRR*trial = 576.33). This model
outperformed the null model (AICnull = 677.35) (χ2 =
111.02, df = 5, p < .001), as well as models predicting
performance based on the ratio of ratios (AICRR = 652.97)
(χ2 = 84.64, df = 4, p < .001), trial type (AICtrial = 608.78)
(χ2 = 38.45, df = 3, p < .001), and ratio of ratios and trial

and comparison category

Discussion
Not surprisingly, performance on this task was much
worse than performance in Experiment 1 and this is
probably due to the fact that we included many more
difficult trials. In particular, the number vs. proportion and
area anti-correlated trials were meant to be more difficult
than the target equal trials used in Experiment 1. The
interaction between ratio of ratios and trial types suggest
that participants are using an area calculation as part of their
estimations and this is interesting given the lack of an effect
of area in the ANS literature (Halberda & Feigenson, 2008).
Importantly, the comparison category did not seem to affect
participant’s judgments which may indicate that adult
participants are able to compute an accurate probability
estimate regardless of the likelihood of obtaining a target
event.
However, since there are only two of each
comparison category and the comparisons are not evenly
spaced throughout the ratios of ratios used in the study, the
effect of qualitative distinctions between comparisons must
remain open to speculation.
Interestingly, performance was still above chance even
with the more difficult trials used in Experiment 2 and there
was still no correlation with ANS acuity even though there
was still a significant effect of the ratio of ratios. It is still
too early to definitively rule out the role of the ANS in
probability judgments since participants may be using some
computation applied to their estimates of the number of

1011

target and non-target marbles. For example, the participant
might estimate the total number of target marbles as well as
the total number of marbles for both distributions. Since
ANS estimates are inexact, even for those who have with
high number sense acuity, an error in any one of these
estimates could lead to an incorrect judgment. For this
reason it is necessary to understand the computations that
lead to accurate performance as well as the strategies that
people may adopt when reasoning about the probability of
discrete binary outcomes.

comparisons that are reported for Experiments 1 and 2
above.

Models of Probability Discrimination
Several studies investigating the approximate number
sense (Halberda & Feigenson, 2008; Pica et al. 2004) have
used computational models based on signal detection theory
in the psychophysical literature (Green & Swets, 1966).
The psychophysics model assumes that participants’
approximations form a Gaussian distribution on a mental
number line around a mean close to the actual number of
objects being estimated and a standard deviation given by
the participants’ number sense acuity, or Weber fraction,
multiplied by the mean. When presented with two groups
of objects and asked which has more the participants’
estimates form two Gaussian distributions which overlap
based on the distance between their means and the size of
their standard deviations. The area of overlap can be
thought of as the probability of a subject making an error,
which can be modeled using the psychophysical function
based on the CDF of the Gaussian distribution:
𝑃 𝑅# = 	  Φ

'( )'*
+, '(* -'**

.

	   = 	   𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑐
+

'( )'*
+, '(* -'**

(1)

where 𝑃(𝑅# ) is the probability of a correct response, w is
the subjects’ Weber fraction, 𝜇. and 𝜇+ are the means of the
two numbers being estimated, and Φ is the Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) of the Gaussian distribution.
This model assumes that participants estimate probability
as an exact numerical value between 0 and 1. Although
Equation 1 seems to be a plausible model for how people
are making judgments about probability based on
comparisons of two binary distributions, assessment of the
likelihood of this model reveals that it is not well fit to the
data. Figure 5 provides the model predictions alongside the
data from Experiments 1 and 2.
The probability of selecting a target color marble from the
distributions used in Experiments 1 and 2 can be represented
as rational numbers between 0 and 1. If the subjects in our
study are using their ANS to calculate probabilities they
would need to approximate the number of favorable objects
and divide this by the total number of all objects in the
distribution which could be modeled using the distribution
of a ratio of two random variables. Although a general form
for calculating the probability density function for this
distribution exists (Hinkley, 1969), a model using
assumption distribution makes similar predictions as the
model assuming a Gaussian distribution with the ratio

with data from Experiments 1 and 2. (a) Predictions and
data for Experiment 1. (b) Predictions and data for
Experiment 2.

General Discussion
Using a combination of experimental evidence and
computational modeling we sought to demonstrate the role
of the approximate number sense in adult participants’
judgments of probability based on proportion. In two
experiments we demonstrated that adults’ ANS acuity was
not statistically significantly correlated with performance on
a probability discrimination task. Since a large correlation
would have been detected in these experiments, these results
suggest that the ANS is not recruited when people make
judgments about probability based on proportion.
It is possible that participants’ judgments about
probability comparisons are more heavily influenced by
qualitative factors such as trial type and comparison
category. Future work will include larger numbers of more
varied comparisons in order to more thoroughly investigate
the factors influencing probability judgments. In addition,
we plan to use more complex models that can account for

1012

both quantitative and qualitative factors in judgments of
probability based on proportion.
