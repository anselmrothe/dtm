Abstract

processing (e.g., ease of processing), which is generated
from the experience from participants.
Monitoring for text learning has usually been found to be
less accurate than word-pair learning (e.g., Dunlosky,
Baker, Rawson & Hertzog, 2006). One sort of
metacognitive knowledge that readers often rely on to make
judgments about their comprehension performance is
processing ease, suggesting that readers who perceive a
more fluent reading experience tend to believe that they
have better comprehension (e.g., Dunlosky, et al., 2006;
Hertzog, Dunlosky, Robinson & Kidder, 2003; Maki, 1998).
Processing ease has often been studied as the amount of
disruptions in reading. Dunlosky and his colleagues (2006)
proposed that processing ease was one of the major cues for
readers to judge their subsequent performance on recall or
comprehension. However, this cue was often misleading for
learners to estimate their learning (Hertzog, et al., 2003).
Information foraging theory also attempts to explain how
people manage the acquisition of information in text
environments, such as from the internet (Pirolli & Card,
1999). It suggested that information seekers would adapt to
the payoff structure (information values and search costs) of
the environment to accumulate information gain.
Information value is estimated by “information scent”
representing a proximal cue of profitability of information
(Pirolli & Card, 1999). For example, in the web search,
information scent is defined as the semantic relevance
between a proximal cue (such as the hyperlinks, titles of the
website, or the text snippets of a webpage) and the distal
information (such as the linked website).
To answer the question, what makes learners feel they are
learning, we adopted theories from both metacognition and
information foraging to investigate the cues of perceived
learning. Following Koriat (1997), two kinds of proximal
cues were examined. First, like information scent of a site
(Pirolli & Card, 1999), people may rely on the amount of
new information (i.e., new ideas) in the text to determine the
amount of knowledge they are able to gain from a text.
Accordingly, when individuals perceive that there is more to
learn from the texts (an intrinsic cue) and use this as a cue to
perceived information gain, they would perceive that they
could learn more.
Alternatively, as demonstrated in the literature in
metacognition (Dunlosky et al., 2006), people may rely on
encoding fluency (i.e., ease of processing, a mnemonic cue)
to determine the amount of knowledge they are able to
acquire from a text. Individuals who perceive that they have
less difficulty learning information from the texts will
perceive they learn more. Therefore, either one or both of
the cues, the perceived amount of new information and

While learning in a multitext environment increases with the
rise of electronic environments, little is known about what
makes learners feel that they should continue learning or
already learn enough from one text. The current study aimed
at examining what cues learners use to regulate their effort
among multiple sources in a multitext environment. By
manipulating the amount of new information and conceptual
overlap across texts within a topic, we created three types of
text environments to generate different trajectories of two
cues to perceived learning, new information (measured by
rating of perceived new information) and encoding fluency
(measured by ratings of reading ease). Results showed that
the dominant cue to gauge perceived learning was the
perceived amount of new information. The study extended
theories in animal foraging and metacognition, and
established a novel paradigm to better investigate adult
learning in the wild.

Introduction
With the availability of information sources is exploding
through the development of modern information
technologies, learners have to take an active role to manage
their learning in contemporary education settings. Since
viewing all information is not possible given our limited
processing capacity (Simon, 1956), choosing the important
information, as well as deciding the amount of effort to
allocate to particular sources of information, is necessary for
promoting learning. However, how learners determine if
they would like to continue or stop learning remains
unknown. The current study aimed at investigating the cues
learners used to gauge their perceived learning, which
would in turn influence when they stop learning.
Research in metacognition has examined the way in
which the learner takes an active role to regulate study.
Research has suggested that learners allocate their study
time according to their perception of how well they are
learning the materials (e.g., judgments of learning (JOLs),
Dunlosky & Connor, 1997; Metcalfe & Kornell, 2005).
Koriat (1997) has argued that learners monitor different
sorts of cues in accessing their learning to generate the
JOLs. Intrinsic cues are the characteristics of the study
items, such as inherent difficulty (e.g., word frequency,
familiarity of the items). Extrinsic cues are the conditions of
study (e.g., presentation rate or the encoding process
available for the learners). Mnemonic cue reflects learners’
own assessment of learning, such as the assessment of the
outcome of previous recall (e.g., JOLs or recall accuracy
from the previous round of study) or the assessment of

with more new concepts than the items with fewer new
concepts. This finding suggested a way to differentially
foster encoding fluency while increasing the equivalent
amount of new information (ideas) in text, through the
repeated usage of concepts across articles, called conceptual
overlap. By manipulating the amount of new information
and conceptual overlap across articles, the three conditions
were summarized in Table 1.
In the HI-LCO condition (high information and low
conceptual overlap), there were more and more new ideas
and more new concepts introduced as participants read the
articles in a topic. As shown in Figure 1a, participants
would be expected to experience an increasing amount of
new information if they continued to exploit this text patch.
In addition, because the conceptual overlap among articles
was low in this condition, participants would be expected to
experience low encoding fluency across articles (as in
Figure 1b). In the HI-HCO condition (high information and
high conceptual overlap), there were more and more new
ideas but few new concepts introduced as participants read
the articles in a patch. The conceptual overlap among
articles would be expected to increase coherence across
articles even though the information load was high.
Therefore, as shown in Figure 1a and 1b, participants would
be expected to experience high information gain, but also
high encoding fluency over the articles in this condition. In
the LI-HCO condition (low information and high conceptual
overlap), texts introduced virtually no new information and
were, of course, high in conceptual overlap. As shown in
Figure 1a, participants would be expected to perceive little
new information because the content of articles was
repetitive. At the same time, because of the use of
paraphrase, participants would have high encoding fluency
(Figure 1b).
The differential patterns of change in these cues across
the articles in three conditions allowed us to test how these
cues affect perceived learning in three conditions (Figure 1c
and 1d). By investigating the functions of perceived learning
in the three conditions, we were able to differentiate the
cues learners use to estimate their perceived learning.

perceived encoding fluency may contribute to the perceived
learning. Hence, the current study used three kinds of
multitext environments to operationalize the availability of
these proximal cues. By using the analogy of “food patches”
in foraging theories, a collection of articles under a topic
was operationalized as a text patch in the study.
Specifically, the manipulation focused on the relationship
across articles on a topic (which operationalized the “text
patch”) to induce different trajectories of fluency and
availability of new information to examine their relative
contributions to perceived learning. To create three patch
types varying in the amount of new information and the
stimulation of perceived encoding fluency, the current study
followed Kintsch’s theory on how information is encoded
from texts (Kintsch 1994). Kintsch and his colleagues
(1975) suggested that although introducing new concepts in
a sentence creates demands for comprehending, introducing
new propositions (i.e., ideas) about the same concepts is less
effortful relative to introducing new ideas that contain new
concepts. In other words, while introducing more new ideas
(propositions), there was a way to mitigate the effort of
encoding by using the same concepts to build up new
relationships among old concepts. They demonstrated this
empirically by showing that while controlling the number of
propositions and sentence length in the short sentences,
learners spent longer time and recalled less for the items

Participants
Seventy-nine participants were recruited from Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Data from 27 people were excluded due
to technical problems. Data from the remaining fifty-two
participants (Mean age =38.9, SD=10.9, age range=23-69;
46% female) were used in the analysis. Most (60%) of the
participants completed college (Mean years of education
=15.3, SD=1.9, range=12-20).

constructed as follows.
The HI-LCO condition was the high information - low
conceptual overlap condition. Following the introduction,
the subsequent articles were constructed so that each
subsequent article ArticleN contained relatively more new
information (i.e., propositions) and new concepts than
ArticleN-1. This was accomplished by elaborating on five
different areas (subtopics) of the topic to create the five
subsequent articles. In this condition, new ideas as well as
new concepts were consistently introduced across the six
articles in a topic.
The HI-HCO condition was the high information - high
conceptual overlap condition. Subsequent articles were
created by introducing new ideas using about the concepts
that had been introduced in prior articles within the same
topic. There was always more new information but few new
concepts in ArticleN relative to ArticleN-1 in this condition.
Subsequent articles were constructed by elaborating on
existing concepts with new ideas. For example, for the topic
of “bone graft,” the first article briefly introduced concepts
such as allografts and autografts, as well as more basic
concepts related to donors, locations of grafts (hips, spines),
tissue banks, materials, procedures, and so forth; subsequent
articles elaborated, for example, on allografts and
autografts, in part by grounding the explanation in these
more basic concepts.

Materials
In the study, adults were asked to learn about
“Transplantation and Donation” by reading a set of short
articles about three topics, Bone Grafts, Blood Donation and
Corneal Transplants. These text materials were adapted
from articles extracted from dozens of health information
websites with good credibility, such as MedlinePlus,
WebMD, Mayo Clinic and others. For each topic, three sets
of six sequential articles were created, with the three sets
constituting the primary manipulation of the experiments,
such that sets varied in the amount of new information and
degree of conceptual overlap across articles (i.e., repeated
use of the same concepts in multiple articles). New
information in an article was operationalized as the ideas
(propositions) that had not appeared in any of the previous
articles under the same topic. Conceptual overlap was
operationalized as the proportion of the same content words
that were appeared in the consecutive articles. This measure
was obtained from Coh-Metrix, a text analysis database
developed by Grasser and his colleagues (Graesser,
McNamara, Louwerse & Cai, 2004).

The LI-HCO condition was the low information - high
conceptual overlap condition. This was a paraphrase
condition that introduced minimal new ideas or concepts
across the five subsequent articles. There was almost no
new information or new concepts in ArticleN relative to
ArticleN-1. In this condition, the information in the first
article was paraphrased in the five subsequent articles
without adding new concepts or new ideas. (Because it was
not practically feasible to have the low information - low
conceptual overlap condition in which introducing no new

in the study).

Table 3. Descriptive statistics for ratings of perceived
reading ease, the perceived amount of new information,
perceived learning and comprehension in three conditions

To verify the differences in conceptual overlap across
conditions, CohMetrix (Graesser et al., 2004) was used.
Conceptual overlap was defined as the proportion of content
words that occurred in the current article and any of the
previous articles on the same topic (MHI-LCO =0.28, SEHI-LCO
=0.01; MHI-HCO =0.47, SEHI-HCO =0.01, MLI-HCO =0.70, SELIHCO=0.01). ANOVA was conducted to examine the effects
of condition on conceptual overlap. There was a significant
effect of condition on conceptual overlap (F(2,42)=367.20,
p<.0001). Post-hoc tests further confirmed that conceptual
overlap in the HI-LCO condition was lower than the HIHCO condition (d=-0.18, p<.001) and the LI-HCO
condition (d=-0.42, p<.001) and the conceptual overlap in
the HI-HCO condition was lower than the LI-HCO
condition (d=-0.23, p<.001).

article was presented (Figure 2a). After reading each article,
participants pressed a button, which initiated the
presentation of three rating scales (Figure 2b) to
operationalize perceived encoding fluency, the perceived
amount of new information and perceived learning. The
perceived amount of new information was assessed with the
item, “Taking into account the other articles that you have
read today about this topic, how much new information was
in this article?” which participants rated on a scale of 0 to
100, where 0 meant that this article did not have any new
information, and 100 meant that this article had completely
new information. Encoding fluency was assessed with the
item, “How easy was it for you to understand this article?”
which participants rated on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0
meant that it was very difficult to learn from this article, and
100 meant that it was very easy to learn from this article. In
addition to the hypothesized proximal cues used to
determine information gain, perceived learning was assessed
by the item, “Taking in to account the other articles that you
have read today about this topic, how much new
information did you learn from this article?” which
participants rated on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 meant that
they did not learn anything new from this article, and 100
meant that they learned everything from this article.
After providing these ratings for the article, participants
pressed the “NEXT” button to read the subsequent article.
After reading all six articles about one topic, participants
were directed to a new topic and continued in the same way.
Articles within a topic were presented sequentially. After
reading one topic, participants answered three multiplechoice questions about the main concepts in the introductory
article. Lastly, participants completed two cognitive tasks.
Reading time on each page was recorded.

Despite the fact that conceptual overlap was different
across conditions, all other linguistic properties of the texts
in three conditions were carefully controlled, including the
number of words, number of sentences, sentence length,
word frequency (Balota, et al., 2007) and readability
(descriptive statistics in Table 2). There were no differences
in the number of words (F(2,51)=0.003, p=0.99), number of
sentences (F(2,51)=0.93, p=0.40), sentence length
(F(2,51)=1.27, p=0.29), average log word frequency
(F(2,51)=0.23, p=0.80), log word frequency of all content
words (F(2,51)=0.50, p=0.61) and Flesch-Kincaid grade
levels (F(2,51)=2.95, p=0.6) across three conditions.
Therefore, except the differences in new propositions and
conceptual overlap, the texts used in three conditions were
largely equivalent.

Experimental Design
The study followed a within-subject design with condition
being the within-subject variable (The HI-LCO condition,
HI-HCO condition and LI-HCO condition). The order of
condition was counterbalanced. Participants would answer
three multiple-choice questions about the shared contents
across three conditions (the first article) at the end of the
each topic. The purpose was to motivate participants to pay
attention to the study, and make sure that participants read
and understood the main ideas in each topic.

Procedure
When a participant logged into Mechanical Turk, s/he
was presented with a consent form, and then completed a
demographic questionnaire. For the main task, participants
were asked to learn health information from multiple texts,
with the goal to learn as much as possible about topics
related to Donation and Medical Transplants. All
participants were asked to read 18 articles, six articles in
each of the three conditions. The assignment of condition to
each topic was counterbalanced.
To begin, participants viewed a button corresponding to
one of the topics, Bone Grafts, Blood Donation or Corneal
Transplants. Once clicking on the topic button, the first

Results
The analysis focused on answering two questions; (a)
whether participant’s ratings of new information and ease of
processing varied across conditions as predicted, and (b) to
what extent did learners use these cues to judge their
perceived learning across the articles.

of the comprehension questions in the three conditions.
Repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine the
effects of condition on encoding fluency showing a
significant main effect of condition (F(2,51)=3.88, p<.05).
Post-hoc tests suggested that adults thought articles in the
HI-LCO condition were more difficult than articles in the
HI-HCO condition (d=-2.25, SE=1.15, p=0.05) and the LIHCO condition (d=-4.69, SE=1.92, p<.05). However,

SE=3.61, p<.001).
Finally, there was a significant effect of condition on
comprehension performance (F(2,36)=3.66, p<.05). Adults
tended to perform better in the LI-HCO condition than the
HI-HCO condition (d=0.12, SE=0.05, p<.05) and the HILCO condition (d=0.11, SE=0.04, p<.01), in part because of
the repetition of ideas across articles. There was no
difference in performance between the HI-LCO condition
and the HI-HCO condition (d=0.01, SE=0.05, p=0.87).

articles in the HI-HCO condition were equivalent with
articles in the LI-HCO condition in terms of encoding
fluency (d=2.44, SE=1.87, p=0.20). There was also a
significant effect of condition on the perceived amount of
new information (F(2,51)=123.45, p<.001). Post-hoc tests
further showed that participants thought there was more new
information in the HI-LCO condition than the HI-HCO
condition (d=7.44, SE=2.00, p<.001) and the LI-HCO
condition (d=49.36, SE=4.12, p<.001). Adults also rated
that there was more new information in the HI-HCO

(F(2,51)=96.69, p<.001). Post-hoc tests further showed that

condition than the HI-HCO condition (d=5.59, SE=1.96,

The Effects of Condition on the Changes in
Monitoring
Mixed effects models (PROC MIXED in SAS) were used
to analyze how the ratings changed across articles in three
conditions article by article (Estimates of parameters are in
Table 4). The same contrast coding was used to examine the
effects of condition.
Results showed that reading ease increased across articles
in the LI-HCO condition more than in the other two
conditions (t=-3.05, p<.01). However, there was no
difference in the changes in reading ease between the HILCO and HI-HCO conditions (t=-0.44, p=0.66) (See Figure
3a for the average ratings of encoding fluency as a function
of articles in three conditions). On the other hand, the
perceived amount of new information decreased across
articles more in the LI-HCO condition than the other two
conditions (t=8.56, p<.001). There was also no difference in
the changes of the perceived amount of new information

Figure 3. (a) Perceived ease, (b) the perceived amount of new information, (c) perceived learning from articles on the
same topic, as a function of condition

between the HI-LCO condition and HI-HCO condition (t=0.25, p=0.80) (See Figure 3a for the average ratings of the
perceived amount of new information with progression
through the articles in the three conditions). Similarly,
perceived learning also decreased across the articles more in
the LI-HCO condition than the other two conditions (t=7.62,
p<.001). The changes in perceived learning did not differ in
the HI-LCO condition and HI-HCO condition (t=0.72,
p=0.47) (See Figure 3a for the average ratings of perceived
learning as a function of articles in three conditions). So
generally it appeared that perceived learning tracked the
changes in new information and not fluency (as measured
by reading ease).

learning when they also perceive new information is
available. The dominant cue for judging perceived learning
in this study, which has been neglected in the previous
literature, is the perceived amount of new information
available. Therefore, the main contribution of the current
study was to provide the evidence that the perceived amount
of new information has accounted for most of the variance
in perceived learning relative to encoding fluency. However,
regarding the probes we used to measure the cues and
perceived learning, there were similar phrases used in the
probes for both the perceived amount of new information
and perceived learning, follow-up studies would avoid using
similar terms across probes for cues and perceived learning.
In addition to the use of different probes for the cues and
perceived learning, follow-up studies would use this
paradigm to examine how learners use these cues to regulate
their study and their actual learning outcome. Given that the
goal of the study was to understand what makes learners
feel that they are learning, we did not measure the learning
outcome deliberately. The multiple-choice questions used in
the study were mainly used to ensure that participants
captured the major ideas in the topic (with the accuracy
scores exceeding 80%), instead of to measure the individual
differences in learning outcome. Hence, follow-up studies
would focus on how learners use these cues to regulate their
study for optimizing their learning in the multitext
environments.

The Cues to Perceived Learning
To further investigate the cues used to judge perceived
learning, an analysis was done to test how changes in
reading ease and the perceived amount of new information
related to the changes in perceived learning article-by-article
using the linear mixed effects models. Results showed that
the perceived amount of new information was the dominant
cue used to judge perceived learning (Est=0.78, SE=0.01,
t=61.48, p<.0001), but that reading ease was not (Est=-0.04,
SE=0.03, t=-1.24, p=0.21).

Discussion
Our findings successfully validated the text manipulation in
three conditions such that adults perceived that the LI-HCO
condition had less new information than the HI-HCO and
HI-LCO conditions did. Also, averaging ratings from six
articles in one condition, adults tended to perceive that the
LI-HCO and HI-HCO conditions were easier than the HILCO condition. Interestingly, averaging six articles, adults
even rated articles in the HI-HCO condition overall as easy
as those in the LI-HCO condition. Even if there was much
more new information in the HI-HCO condition than the LIHCO condition, conceptual overlap induced encoding
fluency for learners to comprehend information in the HIHCO condition and the LI-HCO condition equivalently.
Therefore, as expected, when manipulating the amount of
new information and conceptual overlap across articles,
adults perceived more new information and lower encoding
fluency in the HI-LCO condition; more new information
and higher encoding fluency in the HI-HCO condition, and
less new information and higher encoding fluency in the LIHCO condition. Results also suggested that amount of new
information was more central for learners to judge how
much they were learning than fluency.
Some previous studies have shown that learners relate
encoding fluency to their judgments of learning, although
encoding fluency is a misleading cue for estimating actual
learning performance (Dunlosky et al., 2006; Rawson et al.,
2002). Interestingly, in our study, although some learners
did relate encoding fluency to their learning to a modest
degree, the dominant cue to perceived learning was not
encoding fluency. Encoding fluency did not contribute to
perceived learning alone. It appears that encoding fluency is
only a meaningful cue for adult learners to gauge their
