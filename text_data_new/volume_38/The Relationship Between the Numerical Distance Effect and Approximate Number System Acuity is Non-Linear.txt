Abstract
People can estimate numerical quantities, like the number of
grapes in a bunch, using the Approximate Number System
(ANS). Individual differences in this ability (ANS acuity) are
emerging as an important predictor in research areas ranging
from math skills to judgment and decision making. One
commonly used ANS acuity metric is the size of the
Numerical Distance Effect (NDE): the amount of savings in
RT or errors when distinguishing stimuli values as the
numerical distance between them increases. However, the
validity of this metric has recently been questioned. Here, we
model the relationship between the NDE-size and ANS
acuity. We demonstrate that the relationship between NDEsize and ANS acuity should not be linear, but rather should
resemble an inverted J-shaped distribution, with the largest
NDE-sizes typically being found for near average ANS
acuities.

Introduction
People can evaluate non-symbolic numerical magnitudes
(i.e., which pack has more wolves) without counting (Taves,
1941). Indeed, people can respond based on these perceived
magnitudes without necessarily linking these values to
symbolic numbers (Kaufman, Lord, Reese, & Volkmann,
1949). The system that makes these non-symbolic numerical
magnitude evaluations is herein referred to as the
Approximate Number System (ANS). Essentially, the ANS
allows us to perceive numerical magnitudes from the world
in an analog fashion, similarly to how we perceive other
magnitudes, like size (Kaufman et al.). The facility of the
ANS to make numerical magnitude judgements (ANS
‘acuity’) is thought to vary among individuals, such that
some individuals can make faster and more accurate
judgments with smaller magnitude ratios than other
individuals (Halberda & Feigenson, 2008). Better ANS
acuity has been linked to better math skills in elementary
schools and better performance on standardized tests
(Gilmore, McCarthy, & Spelke, 2010; Halberda et al.,
2008). Recent work has even suggested that the ability to
understand the magnitude of numbers, a skill at least
partially grounded in ANS acuity, influences judgment and
decision making in adults (Peters, et al., 2008; Schley &
Peters, 2014). As such, it is important that researchers use
valid and reliable measures to assess ANS acuity.
Unfortunately, while assessments of mathematical skill are
well understood, being similar to math tests one might take
at school (e.g. Cokely, Galesic, Schulz, Ghazal, & Garcia-

Retamero, 2012; Lipkus, Samsa, & Rimer, 2001; Weller,
Dieckmann, Tusler, Mertz, Burns & Peters, 2013), metrics
of individual differences in ANS acuity are less well
investigated.
One widely used metric of ANS acuity is the ‘size’ of the
Numerical Distance Effect (NDE): The difference in
reaction time or accuracy between distinguishing values that
are close to each other and distinguishing values that are
more distant from each other. In a practice which seems to
have which originated with Sekuler and Mierkiews (1977),
researchers will measure the speed and accuracy of
numerical comparisons (e.g. “Which is larger?”) at smaller
(harder) and larger (easier) distances. Bigger differences in
speed and accuracy between these easier and harder trials
are interpreted as evidence of poorer ANS acuity (see Price,
Palmre, Battista, & Ansari, 2012 for discussion). Recently,
NDE-size has come under fire, with several studies
questioning both its reliability, and its ability to distinguish
individual differences in ANS acuity (Gilmore, Attride, &
Inglis, 2011; Holloway & Ansari, 2009; Inglis & Gilmore,
2014; Maloney, Risko, Preston, Ansari, & Fugelsang, 2010;
also see Sasanguie, Defever, Van den Bussche, & Reynvoet,
2011). Given the extent of the use of NDE-size in past
literature as a metric of ANS acuity and the growin g
collection of recent publications that questions its validity,
we believe it critical to examine the theoretical support as to
whether NDE-size has the potential to serve as a metric of
ANS acuity. Here, we model the theoretical relationship
between ANS acuity and NDE-size. To foreshadow our
conclusions, we do not find evidence that NDE-size can
serve as a general measure of ANS acuity.

Individual Differences, ANS Acuity, and the NDE
Since Halberda et al.’s (2008) seminal work retrospectively
predicting elementary school math ability from ANS acuity
in fourteen-year-olds, a flurry of studies have linked ANS
acuity to mathematical and academic success in children,
adolescents, and adults (see Chen & Li, 2014, for metaanalysis and review). This connection between ANS acuity
and other numerical skills can be explained by a mapping
between non-symbolic ANS magnitudes and symbolic
numbers. Humans, unlike other animals, have resources
beyond the ANS to help them evaluate numbers. People can
represent numbers verbally (e.g., “three thousand”) and with
other symbols (e.g., 3000) and do so with much greater
precision than the ANS can achieve: The symbolic number
3000 is distinguished from 2999, but one cannot perceive
the magnitude difference between 3000 and 2999 grains of

1559

rice. However, there is strong evidence that people invoke
ANS-based analog magnitudes when considering symbolic
numbers (Dehaene, Bossini, & Pascal, 1993; Moyer &
Landaur, 1967). In Moyer and Landaur’s (1967) seminal
study, it was demonstrated that people show distance effects
when making judgments about the quantities referenced by
symbolic magnitudes. For example, people are faster at
determining 6 is smaller than 9 than that 7 is smaller than 8.
Such effects would result from neither use of symbolic
look-up tables nor sequential-count based comparison
processes, but (as discussed below) are a classic pattern in
analog magnitude comparisons (Moyer & Landaur).
If symbolic number processing involves the ANS, one
could therefore predict that performance on tasks involving
symbolic numbers may be influenced by individual
differences in ANS acuity. Moreover, as higher order
mathematical skills build off one’s understanding of
symbolic numbers, one could further posit that these
mathematical skills may be predicted by one’s ANS acuity.
Following this logic, some tasks used to assess individual
differences in the ANS use symbolic numbers rather than
non-symbolic numerical magnitudes (e.g., Holloway &
Ansari, 2009; Seilger & Opfer, 2003; Sekuler & Mierkiews,
1977), even though symbolic numbers access ANS
magnitudes only indirectly. Indeed, it appears that Moyer
and Landaur’s now classic approach of using the presence
of distance effects to demonstrate that the ANS is invoked
in symbolic magnitude comparis ons inspired the later use of
NDE-size as an ANS acuity metric (Sekuler & Mierkiews).

ANS Theory and NDE-Size
The exact nature of the ANS has yet to be completely
determined, but it is well established that the perception of
non-symbolic numerical magnitudes obeys Weber’s law
(Cordes, Gelman, Gallistel, & Whalen, 2001; Dehaene,
Izard, Spelke, & Pica, 2008; Mechner, 1958; Meck &
Church, 1983; Whalen, Gallistel, & Gelman, 1999). As is
typically the case for magnitude perception (see Kingdom &
Prins, 2009), numerical magnitudes are not perceived
exactly, but rather percepts are normally or quasi-normally
distributed around a mean value (which may itself be
biased). The ability to distinguish between two quantities is
dependent on the amount of overlap between their perceived
magnitude distributions. Importantly, the overlap in the
distributions of any two values - and thus the ease with
which two values can be distinguished - is dependent upon
their ratio, rather than upon the absolute distance between
them. As a result, one can observe both size effects and
distance effects in magnitude discriminations. ‘Distance
effects’ refers to the observation that, within a given range,
it is easier to distinguish numerical quantities that are more
distant from each other (6 dots [:::] vs. 12 dots [::::::]) than
those that are closer together (8 dots [::::] vs. 10 dots [:::::]).
‘Size effects’ refers to the observation that it is easier to
distinguish numerical quantities at the same distance in
smaller magnitude ranges (6 dots [:::] vs. 8 dots [::::]) than
in larger magnitude ranges (14 dots [:::::::] vs. 16 dots

[::::::::]). ANS magnitude comparisons yield standard
psychophysical functions: The likelihood that an individual
will successfully discriminate between two magnitudes will
increase curvilinearly from chance to asymptote at or near
100% accuracy, as the ratio of the larger to the smaller value
increases. RTs similarly decrease with the comparison ratio
(Whalen et al., 1999, see Kingdom & Prins, 2009, for a
discussion of psychophysical functions).
To put it simply, Weber’s law implies that a) the standard
deviation (SD) of the distribution around an estimated
magnitude is proportional to that magnitude’s mean (M) and
b) this proportion is constant. This constant proportion is, by
definition, the Weber Fraction (w) of the perceiver’s ANS.
Thus, ANS acuity is defined by an individual’s ‘Weber
Fraction’ (Cordes et al., 2001; Deheane, et al., 2008;
Halberda, Mazzocco, & Feigenson, 2008, Seigler & Opfer,
2003; Whalen et al., 1999). After accounting for other
biases, this w determines the variability in the representation
of a particular magnitude, which in turn determines the
amount of overlap between any two magnitudes, which
finally determines how likely it is that an individual will be
able to tell two non-symbolic magnitudes apart (ANS
acuity). The smaller an individual’s w, the better an
individual will be at discriminating between non-symbolic
numerical magnitudes, because there is less overlap in their
numerical magnitude perceptions. Also, following Weber’s
Law, there is greater overlap in the magnitude distribution s
perceived from stimuli at smaller ratios (::::/:::, 1.33) than at
larger ratios (::::::/ :::, 2).
It follows that the ANS’ contribution to an individual’s
NDE-size should be a function of the specific magnitudes
being compared and the individual’s ANS acuity (their
Weber fraction, w). Thus, we can model the relative size of
the ANS’ contribution to NDE-size for any specific task and
any given w by calculating the proportion of overlap of the
distributions for any set of magnitude comparison pairs, and
then calculating the savings in overlap for longer distances.
For example, we can find the predicted ANS magnitude
distribution overlap at short distances (4 vs. 5, 5 vs. 6) and
at long distances (1 vs. 5, 5 vs. 9) for a given acuity level
(w) and then find the differences between these overlaps. As
long as judgments are based on ANS distributions, error
rates and RTs should be functionally related to the amount
of overlap in these distributions.

Model
As previously discussed, the ANS obeys Weber’s Law. We
follow the Linear Model of these phenomena here, which
claims magnitudes perceived from stimuli are normally
distributed, such that the means of perceived magnitude
distributions increase linearly with the size of the stimuli
and that the standard deviations of these distributions are
proportional to their means (Cordes et al., 2001). Thus, the
Coefficient of Variation (CV = SD/M) is constant for a
given individual on a given task. This constant CV is the w
of the individual’s ANS: their ANS acuity. We model this
here by representing perceived magnitudes as Gaussian

1560

distributions about unbiased means equal to the ‘stimulus’
value (M), where SD = w * M. As a result, the overlap in
modeled ANS distributions is a function of the stimulus
ratio and the Weber fraction (w) of the ANS: As SD is
proportional to M, the overlap of the distributions derived
from 8 and 10 is the same as that derived from 80 and 100.
(Note that while the model presented in this manuscript
treats magnitude representations as linearly spaced, with
scalar variability, they might alternatively be modeled as
logarithmically spaced with constant variability. However, a
Logarithmic model would yield similar findings.)
Here, we calculated the proportion of overlap between
modeled magnitude distributions . Additionally, following
the method used by Halberda et al. (2008), we used the erfc
(the complementary error function) to determine the rate at
which a given pair of magnitudes will not be distinguished.
Assuming there are no other sources of error (such as bias
or inattention), this erfc should be equal to twice the error
rate of ANS-based magnitude judgments, as the observer
would be presumed to choose the correct answer by chance
on half of such trials. The equations used are given in the
Appendix in the same Matlab code format we used for our
calculations.
We seek to establish the theoretically maximal
relationship between ANS and NDE-size, assuming no
interfering factors or noise. Thus, we model theoretically
ideal NDE-size at a given w for a given comparison pair as
simply the differences between the overlaps or between the
erfcs of different comparison ratios given that w. Real-world
data would involve other sources of RT and error (attention
to task, non-decision time, etc.) and make this relationship
less clear. However, as these factors are separate from the
ANS, they are excluded from this ideal model.

Results
The Relationship Between Overlap, ERFC, and W
In Figure 1, we illustrate the modeled ideal overlap of ANS
magnitudes at various ratios (greater/lesser) as well as the

calculated erfc. Recall, when controlling for total
magnitude, smaller ratios map to smaller distances, and
larger ratios map to larger distances. Smaller ratios have
greater overlaps and greater error rates than larger ratios.
The drop in both overlaps and erfcs is initially steep, but
then “turns the corner” to asymptote to 0. Smaller ws (better
acuity) and larger ws (worse acuity) both yield this same
pattern, but the initial drop is steeper and the asymptote is
reached faster for smaller ws. Using these values, the
theoretical maximum contribution of ANS acuity to NDEsize can be found for any w on any particular NDE task.

The Relationship Between NDE-Size and W
As discussed above, an individual’s NDE-size (i.e., savings
in error rate and RT when comparing numerical magnitudes
at large vs. small distances) should be functionally related to
the difference in the amount of overlap between the
comparison values’ distributions, which is in turn related to
the comparison ratios involved and the individual’s w. We
thus model NDE-size for a given w and pair of stimulus
ratios as the difference in the model overlaps or erfcs:
NDE-size calculation for:
Overlap: Overlap(small ratio) – Overlap(large ratio)
erfc:
erfc(small ratio) – erfc(large ratio)
We first model the ideal relationship between NDE-size
and w for a comparison-pair set based on the distance effect
paradigm originally developed by Moyer and Landauer
(1967), and later expanded upon by researchers intending to
measure NDE-size (see Sekuler & Mierkiews, 1977; Peters
et al., 2008). In Moyer and Landaur’s original paradigm,
participants saw all possible pairs of non-equal integers
between 1 and 9, and indicated which was larger. Although,
it was Moyer and Landauer’s intent simply to demonstrate
that symbolic number comparisons yield distance effects,
researchers often use modified forms of this procedure when
measuring NDE-size (see Peters et al., 2008). A participant
is shown a stimulus value and asked to indicate whether that
value is greater or less than a central comparison value. The

Discussion
Despite the fact that the presence of numerical distance
effects can indicate the involvement of the ANS in a task, it
is becoming apparent that NDE tasks have limited utility for
measuring individual differences in ANS acuity. With this
model, we provide a novel theoretical exploration of the
reasons why this is the case: Even under ideal conditions,
one cannot expect NDE-size and ANS acuity to be linearly
related. Rather, NDE-size initially increases, but then
decreases with ANS acuity, with small NDE-sizes expected
both for individuals with particularly small and particularly
large ws. Our model demonstrates that the relationship
between NDE-slope or NDE-size and w is dependent on
both the ratio range of the stimuli and the w range in the
population. This can be illustrated by considering the
modeled NDE values in Figure 1. For example, if the target
population’s ws range between .04 and .20 and stimuli-pair
ratios range between 1.25 and 2, one could indeed predict
large NDE-sizes for larger ws (worse acuity), because the
smaller ws would have already neared as ymptote for this
range of ratios, and would thus have small slopes . However,
if the target population’s ws ranged from .2-.4 and the
stimuli ratios ranged from 1.05-1.2, the opposite pattern
would emerge. These stimuli ratios are sufficiently small
that all of these ws would be in the initial drop-off range,
with smaller ws dropping faster: Smaller ws, (better acuity)
would yield larger slopes .
For typical NDE-tasks, our model shows peak NDE-size
is approached at ws of ~.2-.3. The location of this peak is a
real concern, given the distribution of ANS ws in the normal
population. Several studies with educated adult participants
have found that their ws typically center around ~.22 (e.g.,
Cordes et. al, 2001; Whalen et al., 1999). Moreover, other
studies of educated adults have found mean ws of .11
(Dehaene et al., 2008), and studies with infants have found
ws of 1.0 (Xu & Spelke, 2000). Thus, one cannot expect that
the range of ws for the population under test will coincide
with the range of ws for which the relationship of w to
NDE-size is quasi-linear on a standard task. Neither can
researchers a priori assume a particular w distribution in a

novel population, so as to be able to adjust their NDE tasks
to yield a theoretically supported prediction of a linear
relationship between NDE-size and w. This is problematic
to the literature as a whole, and particularly for research
attempting to draw conclusions about the nature of ANS
acuity’s involvement in other cognitive tasks.

Conclusions
Individual differences in ANS acuity have increasingly
come to be considered an important predictor of human
cognition and behavior. As such, it is important that the
measures used to assess individual differences in ANS
acuity are both reliable and valid. We recommend that
future researchers assess ANS acuity via tasks whose
reliability has been established. We specifically recommend
against using NDE tasks to assess ANS acuity, as the
validity of such measures is in doubt.

Appendix
The Matlab code used to calculate the proportion of overlap
in the ANS distributions of any two values, given w:
invCdf = 1- normcdf((High - Low)/(w*(High+Low)),0,1)
overlap = (2*invCdf)/(2-(2*invCd f))
The Matlab code used to find the erfc – the value of the
complimentary error function – which is the rate at which
the ANS values will not be distinguished and thus double
the ideal error rate:
erfc(abs(High-Low)/(sqrt((High^2)+(Low^2))*sqrt(2)*w))
“High” referred to the higher value in a comparison pair
(e.g., 6), while “Low” referred to the lower value in the pair
(e.g., 5). “w” referred to ANS acuity (Weber fraction, w).
