Abstract
Attention is a factor that affects the performance of various intelligent activities in humans. Up until now, the methods for
measuring the level of attention have been mostly based on
subjective reports or employing large and costly devices. In
this paper, a new method of estimating the level of attention
is proposed, based on posture and EEG measurements. These
data can be recorded using easily available and less burdensome devices. From the obtained data, the time evolution of
attention was explored. Experiments showed that there is negative correlation between posture variance and attention, and
also between EEG and attention.

Cognitive science: Monitoring the level of attention is also of
interest for cognitive science (Itti & Koch, 2001; Srivastava
& Vul, 2016). For example, knowing the time evolution of
attention may give a clue to how attention is maintained or
generated in the brain.

Keywords: attention, posture measurement, EEG

In these applications, it is preferable to implement a system
using easily available devices, in order to make it accessible
to a large group of users. The method explored in this work
is aimed at realizing such applications.
The underlying assumption of this work is that the posture and EEG of a participant change in correlation to the
level of attention. A reason for using posture is that it is a
quantity that can be relatively easily measured. Unlike many
other physiological quantities, it can also be measured noninvasively. Our preliminary observation showed that the posture of a sitting-down students reflects his/her attention toward the lecture. A focused participant sits fixedly, leaning
rather forward. On the other hand, a non-focused participant
is likely to change their posture more frequently, often leaning backward. Based on this observation, we propose a hypothesis that the movement of posture reflects the level of
attention. This does not mean that a specific posture corresponds to a high or low level of attention. Rather, our model
is that indicators such as average or variance of a posture
related value correlates with the level of attention. In addition, EEG is known to have correlation with performance in
many types of tests (Klimesch, Doppelmayr, Russegger, &
Schwaiger, 1998). This indicates that EEG can perform as an
indicator for the level of attention. We therefore seek specific
indicators in the posture and EEG that are correlated to the
level of attention. These indicators are computed from raw
signals obtained from sensors.

Introduction
Attention is a crucial factor that affects the performance of
various intelligent activities in humans. Measuring the level
of attention is of a great importance for optimizing the performance. Unless the level is estimated properly, it would not
be able to control it. However, most of the ways to monitor the level of attention have been based on participants’ reports (Rich & Gureckis, 2015). Although there are methods
that uses objective measurement, they required high-cost devices such as fMRI or invasive physiological recordings (Itti
& Koch, 2001). In this paper we propose a method of estimating the level of attention using easily available and less
burdensome devices. Devices that we used are pressure sensors and a mobile EEG (electroencephalogram) sensor.
Researchers have revealed that there are various types of
attention, from a subjective and conscious state of mind to
subconscious alert states that can only be measured through
psychological tests. In this work, we focus on a subjective
and conscious level of attention, which humans can recognize
and evaluate by themselves. The goal of this work is to find
features in posture and EEG measurement that correlates well
with this type of attention.
There are numerous applications realized by monitoring
the attentional level. Here we name a few examples in the
fields of education, safety management, and cognitive science.

Education: Knowing the level of attention among students
is valuable for the lecturer since he can use such feedback
for making the lecture more attractive. This is even more
important in the case of e-learning, where the lecturer cannot
easily see the response of the audience.

It has been pointed out that attention is limited in time (Nobre
& Coull, 2010). Humans cannot sustain a high level of attention for a long period of time. In practice, it is important to
know how the level of attention changes over time, and how it
can be recovered. This would help making humans more productive. One goal of our work is to uncover such dynamics

Itti and Koch proposed a model of visual attention that predicts where the participant focuses at (Itti & Koch, 2001). The
model was evaluated on the basis of eye movement and object
recognition. Srivastava and Vul proposed a new model for
the dynamics of attention when a participant is tracking multiple objects displayed on a screen (Srivastava & Vul, 2016).
The level of attention was estimated based on how well the
participant can judge whether the color of the moving object changed or not, despite many other distracting objects.
Walsh et al. evaluated a simulation model for the level of vigilance using the response time of a participant in certain tasks
(Walsh, Gunzelmann, & Dongen, 2014).

Sensor measurement
Sensors similar to the ones used in our work have been proposed for estimating the state of a participant while conducting a certain task. Shen et al. used EEG, blood pressure
sensor, and perspiration sensor to monitor participants during
e-learning (Shen, Wang, & Shen, 2009). Kanki et al. proposed a system for controlling a wheelchair using an array of
pressure sensors embedded to its seat (Kanki, Kuwahara, &
Morimoto, 2014). The user could direct the wheelchair by
moving his center of gravity.

The origin of this coordinate system is at the center of the
balance board. In other words, (x(t), y(t)) = (0, 0) means that
at time t the participant’s center of gravity has the same horizontal coordinates as the center of the balance board. The
size of the balance board used in our experiment was 50 cm
by 30 cm, so sx = 50 cm and sy = 30 cm. The values of wA (t),
wB (t), wC (t) and wD (t) are recorded from the balance board
at 50 Hz, i.e. every 20 milliseconds.
The balance board was placed on a chair whose height was
45.5 cm. The board itself has 5.3 cm height. In total, the
height was 50.8 cm, which is close to chairs used in classrooms. Since participants were all graduate and undergraduate students, we considered this total height to be apt. However, the chair had no backrest, which could have made the
participant feel less comfortable compared to a regular classroom environment. The height of the table on which the tasks
were conducted on was 71.6 cm, which is a little lower than
a desk used in a regular classroom.

Method
Participants
We tested the system with 17 participants. They were all
graduate and undergraduate students in their 20s. Eleven
were male and six were female.

Apparatus and stimuli
In our system, the participant’s posture is measured using
pressure sensors placed within the chair that the participant
is sitting on. Using these sensors, the center of gravity of the
participant’s upper body is tracked. Hereafter, “the center of
gravity” refers to that of the upper body of the participant, ignoring the weight supported by their feet. In addition, EEG
is measured using a mobile recording device that the participant wears on his/her head. The system and its constituent
parts are described in detail in the rest of this section.

EEG recording EEG (electroencephalogram) was
recorded using Neurosky Mindwave Mobile2 , indicated in
Figure 3. Following the recommended usage of the device,
electrodes were placed at three sites on the participant’s
head and forehead, namely Fp1 (frontal pole 1), Fp2 (frontal
pole 2), and A1 (auricular 1) recording sites specified by the
international 10-20 system. If the participant moves by a
large extent during experiments, it can cause some artifacts to
EEG recordings. Since such large movements were expected
to be prominent for the Reversi task, we placed the game
board close to the participant, such that he/she does not need
to move his/her arm much.
The power of each frequency band is sampled at 1 Hz. Although various frequency bands are recordable using this de-

Balance board To measure the posture of the participant
based on the movement of the center of gravity, we used
Nintendo Wii-U balance board1 , illustrated in Figure 1. The
board has pressure sensors embedded at four corners, allowing to measure the weight imposed at each corner. Let A, B,
C, and D represent four corners of the board, that is, front-left,
front-right, back-left, back-right, respectively, as indicated in
Figure 2. Let wa (t) indicate the weight at corner a at time
t, where a is for A, B, C, and D. Let wΣ (t) represent the
total weight imposed on the board at time t, and sx and sy
be the width and the depth of the board, respectively. Using
the weights at four corners, the horizontal coordinates for the
center of gravity (x(t), y(t)) can be obtained as follows.

Procedure
Figure 4 shows the environment for the experiment. Each participant was asked to sit on top of a balance board placed over
a chair. After the outline of the experiment was explained, the
participant wears the EEG recording device. The experiment
took about one hour for each participant. The participants
were divided into two groups. For each group, the three tasks
were conducted in the following order.

vice, we focused on four bands, namely low α, high α, low
β, and high β. Their power at time t is indicated by αL (t),
αH (t), βL (t), and βH (t), respectively. These are suggested
to be most relevant to the level of attention (Klimesch et al.,
1998; Yasui, Tian, & Yamauchi, 2008; Yoshida, Sakamoto,
Miyaji, & Yamada, 2012). Table 1 shows the frequency for
each of these bands, and variables that represent their power.

For estimating the level of attention from the posture of the
participant, we propose to use two indicators, namely variances of x(t) and y(t) over time interval Ik . They are based
on a hypothesis that when the participant is less focused to
the task, they feel more body pain and change the posture
more frequently, thus increasing the variance of the center of
gravity. For EEG based monitoring, we propose to use the
following two variables W and Z that can be calculated from
the power of these frequency bands. In the following definitions of W (t) and Z(t), αΣ (t) indicates the total α power and
βΣ (t) indicates the total β power at time t.
αΣ (t) = αH (t) + αL (t)

This is to reduce the effect of the participant’s level of attention lowering from getting tired from performing many
tasks.
We also recorded during resting periods, but since we did
not ask the participants to stay still, some of them adjusted
the EEG recording device that they were wearing. We are
therefore not using data recorded during the resting periods
for analysis.
In the Reversi match task, the participants had to play the
game under the following constraints.
• For the first three moves, the participant has to wait 10 seconds before making each move.
• After half of all the squares are filled (i.e. 32 squares are
filled) with pieces, the sides are abruptly switched, that is,
the light side player now plays the dark side and vice versa.
This is not told to the participant beforehand.
• Three moves after the switching of the sides, the participant
must make each move within 15 seconds after the opponent
has made a move.

(8)

After these tasks, the participant was requested to fill in a
questionnaire after finishing all of the tasks. The questionnaire asks for a subjective description of how his/her level of
attention changed as he/she conducted the tasks, scored by an
integer from 1 and 5.

(9)

W is based on an existing report which states that the
strength of the β band is relevant to attention (Yoshida et al.,
2012). Z is our own proposal, based on a hypothesis that the
composition of the α band is relevant to the level of attention.
Table 2 summarizes the indicators proposed in this paper.

Analysis
In the questionnaire, the participants were asked to answer their subjective level of attention by five levels, from
“strongly not attentive (1)”, “not attentive (2)”, “neither attentive nor not attentive (3)”, “attentive (4)”, and “strongly
attentive (5)”. Hereafter, we call each of the level as a class.

Conditions
Table 3 indicates three types of tasks conducted for each participant. All of the problems were multiple choice problems
and were presented by printed documents.

Tasks T1 and T2 were divided into three equal-sized intervals, and T3 was divided into two equal-sized intervals. These
eight time intervals are represented by I1 , I2 , ..., I8 , which are
defined in Table 3. Each participant had to give five-level
grading for his/her level of attention during each of the time
intervals. As a result, an 8-dimensional vector C(i) is obtained

for each participant i. Its k-th component Ck is the subjective level of attention at interval Ik for participant i , where

Dynamics
Figures 6, 7, and 8 indicate the center of gravity for 5 different
participants (Participants 1 ∼ 5) at different time points, sampled at 1 Hz, during three different types of tasks (T1∼T3).
Participants can be distinguished by marker types. Note that
the x-axis is more stretched than the y-axis. The plot shows
that the distributions of the center of gravity vary among participants. Some participants have wider distribution, indicating they tend to move more during the task, while others are
more fixed, having smaller variance. It can also be seen that
for the Reversi match task (T3), the participants are more
likely to change their center of gravity.

Table 4 summarizes the answers of the participants to the
questionnaire. Each row represents a participant, and a column is a time intervals defined in Table 3. Figure 5 shows
the distribution of the answers. A box represent the 25th and
75th percentiles, and a red plus is an outlier. The plot shows
that for the CAB calculation problem task and the GAB word
problem task, there is a tendency that reported levels of attention decreases as the time passes.

Table 5 summarizes the correlation coefficients between the
subjective level of attention and different indicators. For
var(x), may participants show negative correlation with the
subjective level of attention, suggesting that when the participant is less attentive, he/she tends to change his/her posture
either more frequently or widely to the x direction (sideways),
thus increasing the variance. For the column for var(x) and

var(y), cells with negative correlation are emphasized. On the
other hand, mean(W ) and mean(Z) had positive correlation
with the subjective level of attention for many participants,
but the difference is not significant. For these columns, cells
with positive correlation are emphasized. Since EEG requires
intensive preprocessing such as filtering. We are expecting
that adding such preprocessing may improve the result. Although the correlation coefficients were of moderate quantity
at this moment, we expect that combining these indicators
would enable good estimation of the level of attention. Such
extension would require determining optimal weight coefficients for combining these indicators. This is left to future
work.

In future work, we would like to develop an estimation
method for the level of attention by combining the indicators
discussed in this paper. Machine learning algorithms can be
used to combine the indicators such that it estimates the actual
level of attention well. We also plan to search for specific patterns that would appear when the level of attention changes.
For example, in Figures 9 and 10, Participant 1 shows abrupt
change of x(t) at around 300 seconds (5 minutes) and that
of y(t) at around 550 seconds (9 minutes) after the start of
the task. This could be due to some disruption of attention.
Rather than looking at the average value of the indicator over
a time interval ranging a few hundreds of seconds, we plan to
look at local features that indicate some change in the level of
attention.

Conclusion
Acknowledgments

A method of estimating the level of attention using posture
measurement and EEG was proposed. The posture and EEG
of the participants were successfully measured using easily
available and less burdensome devices.
The measured attentional level was based on retrospective
reports from the participants, which could be inaccurate. We
would like to introduce more objective measures of attention
which could be measured in real-time. In addition, we plan
to measure the lower body of the participants, especially leg
positions, using an infrared sensor placed under the table.
