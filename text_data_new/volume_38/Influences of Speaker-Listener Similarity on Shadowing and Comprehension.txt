Abstract
We routinely encounter speakers with different accents and
speaking styles. The speech perception literature offers
examples of disruption of comprehension for unfamiliar
speech and also of listeners’ rapid accommodation to
unfamiliar accents. Much of this research uses a single
measure and/or focuses on isolated word perception. We
investigated listeners’ abilities to comprehend and shadow
connected speech spoken in a familiar or unfamiliar accent.
We found increases in shadowing latencies and
comprehension errors in the Dissimilar Speech relative to
Similar Speech conditions—especially for relatively informal
rather than more academic style speech. Additionally, there
was less accommodation over time to Dissimilar than Similar
Speech. These results suggest that there are costs both in the
immediate timescale of processing speech (necessary for
shadowing) and in the longer time scale of listening
comprehension when accent and other speech quality is very
different from one’s own speech.

Introduction
In every perceptual domain, familiarity improves perceptual
speed and accuracy. In speech, familiarity can take many
forms: we can be familiar with the words spoken, with a
particular speaker’s voice quality, or with more general
characteristics of a speech community such as accent and
typical speaking rate. An important question to the study of
speech perception, then, is how do listeners make sense of
unfamiliar speech in order to communicate? In the current
experiment, we examined the effect of familiarity of a
talker’s speaking style on listeners’ ability to comprehend
rapidly and accurately. We manipulated familiarity with
recordings of two speakers reading aloud, one from the
same speech community as the participants and one from a
different speech community.
We will refer to this
manipulation as familiarity with the talker’s speech style or
“accent”, recognizing that many factors affect listeners’
perception of an individual’s speaking style and its
similarity to their own speech.
Previous research has demonstrated that non-native
accents disrupt intelligibility of speech to native speakers, as
do differences in regional accents (Adank, Evans, Stuart-

Smith, & Scott, 2009; Floccia, Goslin, Girard, &
Konopczynski, 2006; Major, Fitzmaurice, Bunta, &
Balasubramanian, 2005). However, it is also clear that both
adults and children can accommodate unfamiliar accents
with sufficient exposure (Maye, Aslin, & Tanenhaus, 2008;
Sumner, 2011; Sumner & Samuel, 2009; White & Aslin,
2011). The ease with which listeners can accommodate to
unfamiliar speech patterns is often held as an example of
how impressive human language abilities are. This
accommodation is often measured via recognition of
isolated words (e.g., Sumner, 2011) rather than sentences or
longer utterances, and the degree of accommodation to
continuous speech is less well understood.
Studies that have investigated perception of connected
speech have often used speech shadowing tasks.
Shadowing requires participants to repeat aloud the speech
they hear as quickly and accurately as possible (e.g.,
Marslen-Wilson, 1973). Sabatini (2000) examined native
Italian speakers trained as professional English-language
interpreters’ listening comprehension, shadowing, and
simultaneous interpretation of nonstandard American
English and Indian nonnative English. Consistent with
previous findings, the unfamiliar accents were less
intelligible to participants in all tasks (Sabatini, 2000).
However, listening comprehension was easier than
shadowing and simultaneous interpretation. The longer time
scale of comprehension tasks is helpful because background
knowledge and downstream speech information may clarify
the interpretation of earlier input. Although top-down
influences occur even on the shorter timescale in which
shadowing occurs (e.g., Marslen-Wilson, 1985; Nye &
Fowler, 2003), shadowing provides an index of the
difficulties listeners encounter in early stages of processing
unfamiliar speech. The Sabatini (2000) study clearly
revealed that non-native listeners have difficulties
processing unfamiliar accents. However, it is unclear
whether such effects also occur for native speakers listening
to unfamiliar speech, such as markedly different regional
accent or voice quality.
We compared shadowing and offline listening
comprehension measures to assess effects of speech
familiarity at two timescales. Two native speakers of
American English from different speech communities each
recorded four text passages for use in shadowing and

1026

comprehension tasks. Two passages were more academic in
character and two were in a more informal narrative style.
This manipulation of Passage Type was included to
determine whether the impact of speaker variability
depended on type of material. The academic passages
contained more low frequency words, which could increase
the difficulty of speech comprehension for these passages
compared to more informal narratives.

Methods
Participants
59 (36 female) native English speakers from the Midwest
United States participated. All participants identified
themselves as white native English Speakers. 29 participants
were assigned to the Similar Speech Condition (16 female),
and 30 to the Dissimilar Speech Condition (20 female).
Participants were recruited from introductory psychology
classes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and
received course credit for their participation.

Stimuli
Four text passages, two academic and two informal, were
used as stimuli. The academic passages were drawn from
reading comprehension portions of the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL) exam. The informal passages
were written transcriptions of two stories from the radio
program “This American Life.” Passages varied between
308 and 350 words in length.
Each passage was recorded by two female native English
speakers, both graduate students in their mid-20s. The
speaker in the Similar Speech Condition is a white woman
from the Midwest, the same region as the participants, while
the speaker in the Dissimilar Speech Condition is an African
American woman from the southeastern US and identifies
herself as a speaker of African American English as well as
Mainstream American English. Speakers were informed that
the recordings would be used for a study of speech
perception and accents. They read through the passages
before making the recordings and were instructed to speak
as naturally as possible, which led to slight differences in
length of each speaker’s recordings (Similar Speech:
M=134 seconds; Dissimilar Speech: M=133 seconds).
Each speaker’s recordings were rated for familiarity by
fourteen white participants from the upper Midwest who did
not participate in the main experiment. Similar Speech
Condition recordings were rated more similar to their own
speech, t(13)=4.00, p=.002; compared to the versions for the
Dissimilar Speech Condition. To be sure that the Dissimilar
Speech recordings were not rated lower in intelligibility and
familiarity for speaker specific—rather than dialect
specific—reasons, an additional eleven African American
participants, primarily from the Southern U.S., rated speaker
familiarity. Critically, these participants rated the Dissimilar
(i.e. African American English) Speech recordings as
marginally more similar to their own speech than the white

Midwestern participants had rated these recordings,
t(23)=1.83, p=.081. The African American raters judged
the recordings of the white speaker as significantly less
similar to their own speech than the white Midwestern
participants rated these recordings, t(18)=3.78, p=.001.

Procedure
Speech similarity (Similar, Dissimilar) was manipulated
between participants. Task (shadowing, comprehension),
and Passage Type (Academic, Informal) were manipulated
within participants, with the order of conditions randomized
for each participant. Passages were presented over
headphones in a quiet lab room. Each participant heard all
four passages once, with assignment of conditions
counterbalanced across participants. All experimental tasks
were run using E-prime 2.0 software. The experiment took
about 20 minutes to complete.
Shadowing Task Participants were instructed to repeat
the words in the passages as they were heard as quickly and
accurately as possible, speaking into a microphone directly
in front of them. One Academic passage and one Informal
passage were presented.
Listening Comprehension Task Participants were
instructed to listen to each passage and were told they would
answer true/false questions afterwards to test their
comprehension. After they heard each passage, they
answered six true/false questions (presented one at a time)
by pressing the T and F keys on the keyboard. One
Academic passage and one Informal passage were
presented.

Coding
Shadowing Task Two trained research assistants, blind to
the experimental hypotheses, coded each participant’s
speech shadowing for errors and latency.
Errors: Any errors or deviations from the original
transcript were coded as omissions, constructive errors, or
delivery errors. Omissions were whole words that
participants omitted in shadowing. Constructive errors
included any added words or changes to words that resulted
in a different word or a nonword. Delivery errors included
slurred hesitations, stuttering, and unintelligible responses.
Latency: Every tenth word of participants' shadowing
was coded for latency relative to the original transcript.
Latency was measured at the word onset, which was
determined by analysis of the speech spectrogram on Praat
software.
Listening Comprehension Listening comprehension
accuracy was measured for each participant as the total
number of true/false questions answered correctly for each
passage.

1027

All analyses were conducted using mixed effects regression
models. Latency analyses were conducted using linear
regression and accuracy analyses were conducted using
logistic regression. To determine the best-fit model, we used
chi-square tests comparing models with and without the
factor of interest. For interactions, we report coefficients
and confidence intervals from the full model, and the chisquare test of model fit from the comparison to a model
with the interaction removed. For main effects, we report
coefficients and confidence intervals from the full model,
and the chi-square test of model fit from the comparison to a
model with the predictor main effect removed. To determine
appropriate random effects, we began with completely
specified random effects structures including random slopes
for all variables in a given model. Using model comparison,
we systematically removed uninformative random effects
(Jaeger, 2009). All final models included random intercepts
for subjects and items.

Results
We first report performance in each task separately and then
examine the relationship between them. Our primary
question for each task is whether speech style influenced
participants' ability to shadow and comprehend that speech.

Shadowing task
The principal measures concerned the effects of speech
condition on speed and accuracy of shadowing responses.
We first analyzed the quantity and types of errors that were
made. We next examined the speed of participants’ speech
shadowing by measuring the latency of their productions
relative to the stimulus onset.
Shadowing errors Participants’ shadowing was highly
accurate overall but they made a larger proportion of errors
in the Dissimilar Speech Condition, M=.09, than in the
Similar Speech Condition, M=.06. Although participants
were more likely to make errors for academic speech
passages, M=.10, than informal speech passages, M=.06,
this difference was larger for those in the Similar Speech
Condition (academic: M=.08 of words; informal: M=.04 of
words) than in the Dissimilar Speech Condition (academic:
M=.10 of words; informal: M=.08 of words). Model
comparisons revealed a main effect of speech condition,
b=.34, 95% CI[.02, .67]; X2(1)=11.46, p<.001, such that
participants in the Similar Speech Condition were more
accurate than participants in the Dissimilar Speech
Condition, and a main effect of passage type, b=-.91, 95%
CI[-1.14, -.68]; X2(1)=8.49, p=.004, such that participants
were more accurate at shadowing academic than informal
speech. The interaction between passage type (academic v.
informal) and speech condition (similar v. dissimilar) was
also significant, b=.59, 95% CI[.43, .75]; X2(1)=51.54,
p<.00001.
Planned follow-up comparisons revealed that the
interaction was driven primarily by participants

We next examined the types of errors that were made. As
seen in Figure 1, constructive errors were most frequent,
M=.04 of words, followed by omissions, M=.03, and then
delivery errors, M=.01. Model comparison revealed a threeway interaction between speech condition, passage type,
and error type (constructive, omission, delivery) on
participants’ accuracy, X2(2)=6.15, p=.05. Follow-up
comparisons revealed that this interaction was carried by the
interaction between speech condition and passage type, as
there was a significant interaction between speech condition
and passage type on the number of constructive,
X2(1)=10.63, p=.001, omission, X2(1)=37.36, p<.001, and
delivery errors, X2(1)=10.19, p=.001. This result suggests
that participants show a somewhat similar pattern of errors
for each speech condition and passage type.
Finally, we examined whether accuracy changed over
time because participants were able to adapt to the speakers’
voice and improve in their shadowing performance. Model
comparisons revealed that the interaction between speech
condition and block was not significant, X2(1)=2.13, p=.14,
nor was the three-way interaction between speech condition,
block, and passage type, X2(1)=.40, p=.53, suggesting little
effect of speech style on accommodation.

Shadowing latency In addition to making more errors,
participants in the Dissimilar Speech Condition also
shadowed more slowly, M=1108ms, SD=.513;
than
participants in the Similar Speech Condition, M=1032ms,
SD=480ms (see Figure 3). Similarly, although participants
were slower to shadow academic, M=1094ms, SD=514ms;
than informal speech, M=1048ms, SD=.483; this difference
was larger in the Similar Speech Condition (Academic
Speech: M=1069ms, SD=509ms; Informal Speech:
M=1001ms, SD=452ms) than in the Dissimilar Speech
Condition (Academic Speech: M=1118ms, SD=518ms;
Informal Speech: M=1098ms, SD=509ms). Indeed, model
comparisons revealed a marginally significant interaction
between speech condition and passage type, b=.05, 95%
CI[-.005, .10]; X2(1)=3.27, p=.07. Planned follow-up
comparison revealed that this interaction was primarily
driven by participants in the Similar Speech Condition being
faster to shadow Informal Speech than Academic Speech,
b=-.07, 95% CI[-.14, -.01]; X2(1)=4.34, p=.037. There were
no other significant effects.
Similar Speech

in the Similar Speech Condition (First Block: M=1161ms,
SD=558ms; Second Block: M=930ms, SD=378ms) than
those in the Dissimilar Speech Condition (First Block:
M=1176ms, SD=556ms; Second Block: M=1023ms,
SD=440ms). However, although there was a main effect of
block, b=-.24, 95% CI[-.46, -.02]; X2(1)=6.43, p=.011, there
was no interaction between speech condition and block,
X2(1)=.30, p=.584. Nevertheless, planned follow-up
comparisons revealed that the effect of block was driven by
the participants in the Similar Speech Condition, as they
showed a significant effect of block, b=-.24, 95% CI[-.46, .03]; X2(1)=4.86, p=.028, but those in the Dissimilar Speech
Condition did not X2(1)=2.19, p=.14. Thus, participants
shadowing speech similar to their own showed better
accommodation to the speaker’s voice than those shadowing
dissimilar speech, as evidenced by shorter latencies as the
experiment progressed.

Listening Comprehension task
Listening comprehension was higher in the Similar Speech
Condition, M=.92, than Dissimilar Speech Condition,
M=.88 (Fig. 4). Comprehension was higher for informal
passages, M=.92, than academic passages, M=.88. As seen
in the figure, participants in both speech conditions were
more accurate on the Informal passages compared to the
Academic ones: Similar Speech Condition (Academic
Speech: M=.90; Informal Speech: M=.95); Dissimilar
Speech Condition (Academic Speech: M=.87; Informal
Speech: M=.89). Model comparisons revealed both
marginal effects of speech condition, b=-.49, 95% CI[-1.04,
.06]; X2(1)=3.02, p=.082, and of passage type, b=-.24, 95%
CI[-.05, .96]; X2(1)=3.01, p=.083, but no significant
interaction between speech condition and passage type,
X2(1)=.84, p=.36, on participants' listening comprehension.

We next examined how latencies changed over the course

longer latencies if the shadowing task occurred in the first

participants’ listening comprehension abilities did not
improve if they had already heard the speaker in the
shadowing task first.

Finally, we examined the relationships between our three
measures—shadowing accuracy, shadowing latency and
listening comprehension. First, as can be seen in Figure 5,
participants who shadowed more slowly also tended to
make more shadowing errors. Comparison of linear
regression models revealed that latency was a significant
predictor of shadowing errors, b=.10, 95% CI[.07, .14];
X2(1)=39.76, p<.001. However, there was no interaction
between latency and speech condition in predicting the
number of speech errors participants made, X2(1)=2.04,
p=.16. Importantly, as can be seen in Figure 5, this
relationship was not significantly different for participants
in the two speech conditions, demonstrating that there was
not a speed/accuracy tradeoff in shadowing. Rather, speech
latency and errors are highly similar measures of shadowing
ability.

and listening comprehension were included as covariates,

that differences in the shadowing task are not driven by
individual differences in language ability. Instead, a critical
predictor of participants’ ability to closely shadow another
person’s speech, is whether or not that speech is similar to
their own speech.

Figure 5. Relationship between shadowing errors and shadowing
latency for participants in each speech condition. Error bands
depict standard error of mean.

Similarly, as can be seen in Figure 6, participants with
better listening comprehension tended to make fewer speech
errors in shadowing. Comparison of linear regression
models revealed that listening comprehension was a
marginally significant predictor of speech errors, b=-.08,
95% CI[-.16, .003]; X2(1)=3.57, p=.06, but listening
comprehension and speech condition did not interact,
X2(1)=.40, p=.53.

In this study we asked whether the familiarity of a talker’s
speaking style affected listeners’ ability to comprehend and
closely shadow it. We found that participants were more
likely to make more errors and lag further behind during
shadowing and to make more comprehension errors for
Dissimilar Speech than Similar Speech. The impact was
larger for more informal speech than academic speech as
informal speech allows for greater variation in speaking
style than the more constrained academic prose. Participants
make more errors and had longer shadowing latencies for
Dissimilar Speech than Similar Speech, and also
demonstrated less adaptation over the course of the task.
This low level of adaptation is somewhat surprising given
that listeners do accommodate slightly to speakers with
unfamiliar accents in other studies (e.g., Maye et al., 2008).
These effects are consistent with findings regarding another
form of accommodation, syntactic alignment, namely the
degree to which a listener subsequently uses the same
sentence structures as a speaker. Weatherholtz, CampbellKibler & Jaeger (2014) found that participants’ degree of
syntactic alignment to recorded speech varied with the
perceived “standardness” of the speaker’s accent and
perceived similarity to the participant’s own speech. In our
own task, speech in the Academic passage is arguably more

1030

standard than the Informal passage regardless of speech
similarity. This increased standardness could explain why
participants’ shadowing of Academic speech was relatively
unaffected by speech similarity.
Our study is the first to our knowledge to compare
listeners’ ability to closely shadow and comprehend speech
of speakers who both were native speakers of the listeners’
language but varied in regional accent and perceived
similarity. By comparing listening in these two contexts we
are taking an important first step in understanding how
listeners process speech that is different from their own.
In the current study, our goal was to examine differences
in speech style holding the content of the material constant.
The overall differences between the speakers were due to a
variety of individual and group factors that were not the
focus of the experiment. One area for future research will be
to replicate these effects with recordings from additional
speakers, in order to distinguish speaker-specific and more
regional factors in speech familiarity. Another important
direction for future research will be to examine the impact
of differences in the speech properties we examined when
other factors such as dialect also vary. The comprehension
of dialects may also depend on their similarity to the
speaker’s own. The combination of less familiar dialect and
speaking style may create greater difficulties.
Future research should also consider how social
information modulates participants’ processing of similar
and dissimilar speech. Previous research has noted a role for
social influence on speech perception (Babel, 2010;
Casasanto, 2008; Kinzler, Dupoux, & Spelke, 2007;
Weatherholtz et al., 2014). It will be interesting to further
explore how social attitudes towards people from different
racial groups and regional groups influence individuals’
abilities to perceive and comprehend their speech. Given
that race and region were both manipulated and correlated
with each other in the current study, it is possible that
participant attitudes may have been contributing to
processing difficulties.

Conclusions
Together our results demonstrate that even when two
speakers speak the same language, differences in speaking
style can create difficulties in processing at multiple
timescales.
