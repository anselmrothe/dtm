Abstract
Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often
struggle with making inductive generalizations. Yet for
typically developing children, the capacity to make such
generalizations is a hallmark of human learning. This ability
requires some understanding of “intuitive statistics” (i.e., the
understanding that there is a relationship between samples
and populations), which have been previously demonstrated
to emerge early on in infancy. We hypothesized that the
challenges with inductive generalization among the ASD
population may have its roots in weaknesses in probabilistic
reasoning. In the current study, we gave children with ASD a
probability prediction task adapted from the method used with
infants in Teglas et al. (2007), and our results over two
experiments with two groups (one from the U.S. and one from
Singapore) suggest that compared with typically developing
children, children with autism may have difficulties in
engaging in probabilistic reasoning.

Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental
disorder that is characterized by impairments in social
interaction and communication, as well as the presence of
restricted patterns of behaviors and interests (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013; Baron-Cohen, 1997).
Cognitive research in the field of autism has centered on
three traditions when it comes to accounting for ASD
(Rajendran & Mitchell, 2007): the theory-of-mind (ToM)
hypothesis, which posits that symptoms of autism manifest
because of deficits in the ability to impute mental states to
oneself and to others (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985;
Premack & Woodruff, 1978); the executive dysfunction
hypothesis, which argues that the symptoms of autism are
caused by core difficulties in the planning and execution of
complex actions (Hill, 2004; Ozonoff, Pennington, &
Rogers, 1991); and the weak central coherence theory,
which proposes that individuals with autism favor local
processing (i.e., the details) over global processing (i.e., “the
big picture”) (Happé & Frith, 2006).
A relatively unexplored perspective is that which
conceptualizes autism as a disorder of learning (following
Pellicano, 2010; Solomon, Smith, Frank, Ly, & Carter,
2011). For instance, a common finding from intervention
studies is that individuals with autism often fail to
generalize explicitly taught skills across different contexts
or to related skills (e.g., Dawson, Mottron, & Gernsbacher,

2005; Hwang & Hughes, 2000; Ivar Lovaas & Smith, 1989;
Ozonoff & Miller, 1995). In more recent work, researchers
have found that children and adolescents with ASD were
less likely to learn from their experiences, and that their
generalizations were less consistent when compared to
typically developing participants (de Marchena, Eigsti, &
Yerys, 2015). Clinicians have also long reported that
children with autism often struggle with generalization
(Rimland, 1964): for example, after being taught to brush
their teeth with a green toothbrush, children with autism
may appear to be at a loss when asked to brush their teeth
with a red toothbrush later on.
Yet for typically developing children, the capacity to
make such generalizations is a hallmark of human learning.
Given small amounts of data, human learners readily make
inductive inferences, formulating general principles that are
extracted from the specific data. Developmental research
have repeatedly demonstrated that children are extremely
proficient learners, making inductive generalizations with
much ease. They learn the meanings of some words with
just a single labeled exemplar (Carey & Bartlett, 1978); they
generalize non-obvious properties to novel objects after just
a short demonstration (Baldwin, Markman, & Melartin,
1993; Gelman & Davidson, 2013; Welder & Graham,
2006), and they learn the physical rules of occlusion with
just a single trial (Wang & Baillargeon, 2005).
To make such generalizations proficiently requires some
understanding of “intuitive statistics”, that is, understanding
that a random sample enables one to make predictions about
an overall population, and conversely, that a population
allows one to make predictions about randomly drawn
samples. This type of statistical inference can be found in
almost every domain of learning, e.g., physical reasoning,
social cognition, word learning, and causal reasoning
(Chomsky, 1980; Gelman & Wellman, 1991; Gopnik &
Sobel, 2000; Gopnik & Wellman, 2012; Griffiths &
Tenenbaum, 2009; Keil, 1981; Kushnir, Xu, & Wellman,
2010; Nisbett, Krantz, Jepson, & Kunda, 1983; Xu &
Tenenbaum, 2007), and the ability to make such inferences
allows learners to rapidly acquire new knowledge about the
world.
Previous research have demonstrated that intuitive
statistics emerges very early on in development, enabling
children to engage in inductive learning within the first few
years of life: 6- to 12-month-old infants are sensitive to
differences in probabilities (Denison, Reed, & Xu, 2011;

2411

Téglás, Girotto, Gonzalez, & Bonatti, 2007; Xu & Garcia,
2008) For example, Téglás et al. (2007) showed that in a
lottery machine-like setup that consisted of 1 yellow and 3
blue objects bouncing around, infants were more
“surprised” to see a yellow object (low probability) exiting
the machine, than when a blue object (high probability) did.
Furthermore, this early sensitivity has been shown to guide
infants and young children in making predictions and in
fulfilling their goals and desires (Acredolo, O’Connor,
Banks, & Horobin, 1989; Denison & Xu, 2010, 2014; Yost,
Siegel, & Andrews, 1962; Zhu & Gigerenzer, 2006).
As such, we hypothesize that the challenges that autistic
individuals face with generalization may have their roots in
weaknesses in probabilistic reasoning. There is some
preliminary evidence for this claim: in a large-scale foraging
task where ASD children (8- to 12-year-olds) and matched
controls had to search a room for a target among possible
search locations embedded into the floor, researchers found
that the autistic individuals appeared to be less sensitive to
the statistical properties of the search area, taking a much
longer time as compared to the matched controls to realize
that one side of the room was more likely to contain the
target (Pellicano et al., 2011).
In the current study, we directly examined probabilistic
reasoning in children with ASD by adapting the method
used with infants in Téglás et al. (2007). This method was
suitable due to its relatively low task demands and was
specifically about probabilistic reasoning. Over two
experiments, 6- to 12-year-old children with ASD and
matched controls were presented with movies displaying
four objects bouncing around a lottery-like machine. The
movies were identical to those shown to 12-month-old
infants in Téglás et al. (2007). The two groups of children
were subsequently asked to predict which object would fall
out by choosing between two pictures displaying two
possible outcomes.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants The sample consisted of 21 verbally fluent
English-speaking 6- to 12-year-old children (18 boys) with
ASD. Diagnoses were confirmed through a review of
clinical diagnostic reports provided by the parents. The
mean age of the sample was 104.6 months (range = 80.6 to
150.6 months). All participants were recruited from
Pathlight School, which is an autism-focused school in
Singapore that offers mainstream academic curriculum and
life-readiness skills. Average Performance IQ was 101.3
(SD = 17.3). Two children were tested but excluded for
failing the control task.
Materials Seven QuickTime movies simulating four threedimensional, solid objects bouncing inside a lottery-like
machine were presented on a 17-inch screen using the
PsyScope software running on a MacBook Pro. These
movies were provided by Luca Bonatti from the set of

stimuli presented to 12-month-old infants in Téglás et al.
(2007). For each movie, two picture cards (8.5 inches x 6
inches) displaying two different possible outcomes were
printed in color and laminated. The back of these picture
cards had a small Velcro strip with “loops.” A separate A4sized (8.27 inches x 11.69 inches) laminated card was also
used, displaying the words “What happened?” above a large
empty printed rectangle. At the center of the rectangle was a
Velcro strip with “hooks,” so a picture card could be
attached to this large laminated card.
Procedure Children were tested individually in a quiet
room at Pathlight School. They sat about 30 inches from the
screen. The children’s parents were present in the room, but
were seated about 60 inches behind the child’s chair.
Parents filled out questionnaires throughout the session to
reduce the potential for influencing their children’s answers.
The procedure consisted of two phases: familiarization
and test. Children were shown two familiarization movies,
four experimental movies and one control movie. The order
of presentation for the four experimental movies was
counterbalanced across subjects. Before each movie, a
visual attractor always appeared on the screen (with sounds)
to orient the child’s attention to the center of the screen.
Familiarization Phase In this phase, children watched
two familiarization movies in which two types of objects
(two of each type, e.g. two blue cubes and two yellow
crosses) bounced around the lottery-like container. After
approximately 10 seconds, one of the objects (e.g. a blue
cube) fell out of the container accompanied by a “cuckoo”
sound. 1 second later, the remaining objects in the container
were occluded. This procedure was repeated for the next
familiarization movie, except that the other type of object
(e.g. a yellow cross) fell out of the container this time.
Test Phase In the test phase, children participated in four
experimental trials and one control trial. In each
experimental trial (Figure 1), three identical objects and one
object of a different color and shape (e.g. three blue cubes
and one yellow cross) were shown bouncing around the
container. After approximately 10 seconds, the container
was occluded as in the Familiarization Phase. 2 seconds
later, a “cuckoo” sound was made, but the bottom half of
the screen was blocked such that it was not possible to see
which object had fallen out. The experimenter said,
“Something happened, but the screen got blocked!” She
then presented two pictures displaying the two possible
outcomes (e.g., one of the three identical objects had exited
the container vs. the object different in color and shape had
exited the container) and said, “Now, I have these two
pictures over here.” Next, the “What happened?” card was
presented and the experiment asked, “Can you show me
what happened?” The children were requested to attach one
of the picture cards to the large rectangular box. If children
failed to respond, the experimenter pointed to the card on
the right and said, “If you think this happened, put this card

2412

here,” and pointed to the card on the left and said, “If you
think this happened, put this card here” in a neutral tone of
voice. After children made a clear choice by placing one of
the picture cards on to the “What happened?” card, the
experimenter proceeded to the next experimental trial. The
order of presentation for the four experimental movies was
counterbalanced across all participants.

Results
An alpha level of 0.05 was used in all statistical analyses.
Preliminary analyses found no effects of median age-split
(whether the children were younger or older than the median
age of the group) and the order of presentation for the four
experimental movies. Subsequent analyses were collapsed
over these variables.
Overall, we found that the children in the Singapore ASD
sample were able to respond correctly in the control trial. 19
out of 21 children responded correctly, and this proportion
was significantly different from chance, Exact binomial p
(two-tailed) < .001. However, children in the final ASD
sample consisting of the 19 children who passed the control
trial did not perform significantly differently from chance
(.50) on the experimental trials (M = .47, SD = .38), t(18) = .301, p = .77. A conservative binomial test based on the
total number of correct trials also showed that children did
not perform significantly different from chance, Exact
binomial p (two-tailed) = .77.

After the four experimental trials were completed,
children were presented with a control trial (Figure 2). Like
the experimental movies, the control movie presented three
identical objects and one object different in color and shape
bouncing around the container. However, there was now a
physical barrier in the middle of the container that confined
the three identical objects to the top of the container. As
such, it was physically impossible for any of the three
identical objects to exit the container. The procedure that
followed was exactly the same as that of the experimental
trials, and children were asked to choose between two
picture cards displaying two different outcomes (e.g. one of
the three identical objects had crossed the barrier and exited
the container vs. the object different in color and shape had
exited the container) as a representation of what had
happened.
No feedback was given during any of the test trials. The
experimenter only responded “Okay” to all of the children’s
choices.
Coding Children’s responses in the test trials (four
experimental and one control) were scored for accuracy. As
children were asked to predict what had happened, choosing
the probable outcome was scored as 1 point. Choosing the
improbable/impossible outcome was thus scored as 0 points.
A second coder recoded all of the children’s responses, and
the level of agreement between the coders was 100%.

Discussion
The children in the ASD sample in Singapore did not
perform reliably better than chance levels in our probability
prediction task. This result is striking given that the movies
used were adapted from Téglás et al. (2007), in which
researchers found strong evidence that 12-month-old
typically developing infants have rational expectations
about future events based on single-event likelihoods.
Furthermore, the low rate of success did not appear to be
due to a lack of understanding with regards to the task
requirements, since 19 out of 21 of the ASD children
(90.5%) answered the control trial correctly. However, it
remains a possibility that typically developing children

2413

would likewise fail at such a probability prediction task. In
other words, while 12-month-old infants may look longer
when presented with an improbable event as compared to a
probable event, older children may still find it difficult to
explicitly make predictions about future events based on
their likelihoods. Such an account is conceivable, as the
infant procedure used in Téglás et al. (2007) was an
implicit, non-verbal task, while our adapted procedure is
arguably a task that is more explicit and verbal in nature. In
Experiment 2, we thus collected data from a US sample
consisting of both ASD and typically developing children.

Experiment 2
Method
Participants The sample consisted of nine verbally fluent
English-speaking 6- to 12-year-old children (8 boys) with
ASD and nine typically developing (TD) 6- to 12-year-old
children (4 boys), group-matched by chronological age. All
participants were recruited from Berkeley, California, and
its surrounding communities through advertisements.
Diagnoses of the ASD participants were confirmed through
a review of clinical diagnostic reports provided by the
parents. Participants in the TD group were excluded if they
had first-degree relatives with an ASD diagnosis. Age was
not found to be significantly different between the two
groups (MASD = 97.07, SDASD = 18.77; MTD = 98.44, SDTD =
19.93), t(16) = .15, p = .88. Visual Spatial Index scores,
which measure the ability to integrate and synthesize partwhole relationships, to evaluate visual details, and to
understand visual-spatial relationships, did not differ
significantly between groups (MASD = 103.29, SDASD =
11.45; MTD = 111.33, SDTD = 15.51) as well, t(14) = 1.15, p
= .27. This index score was not obtained for two of the
children in the ASD sample due to a lack of response to the
component subtests.
Materials and Procedure The materials and procedure in
Experiment 2 were similar to those of Experiment 1, except
for the Familiarization Phase. The Familiarization Phase
was modified slightly to increase children’s understanding
of the task, and the procedure is as follows:
Familiarization Phase In this phase, children watched
each of the two familiarization movies twice. During the
first familiarization movie, the experimenter commented on
the occurring events in such a manner, “Objects bounce
around this circle. When you hear this noise [cuckoo noise],
one object falls out.” The second familiarization movie was
then played, and the experimenter commented on the events
in the same way. Each of the two familiarization movies
was then played once more, without any additional
instructions.
Test Phase The test phase in Experiment 2 was identical
to that of Experiment 1.

Coding Children’s responses in the test trials (four
experimental and one control) were scored in the same way
as Experiment 1. A second coder recoded all of the
children’s responses, and the level of agreement between the
coders was 100%.

Results
An alpha level of 0.05 was used in all statistical analyses.
Preliminary analyses found no effects of median age-split
(whether the children were younger or older than the median
age of the group) and the order of presentation for the four
experimental movies. Subsequent analyses were collapsed
over these variables.
Overall, we found that children in both the ASD and TD
sample were able to respond correctly in the control trial –
all of the children tested made the correct prediction, and
this proportion was significantly different from chance,
Exact binomial p (two-tailed) < .001. Using children’s
responses over the four test trials, we then performed a
repeated measures logistic regression with group (ASD vs.
TD) as the between-subjects variable. Our results indicate
that there was a significant difference between the
performance of the ASD and TD children (MASD = .36,
SDASD = .28; MTD = .70, SDTD = .21), Wald Chi-Square =
7.96, p = .005. A conservative binomial test based on the
total number of correct trials also showed that TD children
performed significantly better than chance, Exact binomial p
(two-tailed) = .029, while ASD children did not, Exact
binomial p (two-tailed) = .13.

Discussion
In Experiment 2, we found a significant difference between
the performance of the ASD and TD children: Children in
the ASD sample in Berkeley did not perform reliably better
than chance levels in our probability prediction task, which
replicates our findings in Experiment 1. In contrast,
typically developing children were successful at this task
and were able to make predictions about future events based
on their likelihoods. This difference found between the two
groups did not appear to be due to a difference in the
children’s ability to understand the task requirements, as all
of the participants were able to respond to the control trial
correctly.

General Discussion
The present study examined whether children with Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show weaknesses in probabilistic
reasoning. Using a probability prediction task adapted from
a method used with 12-month-old infants (Téglás et al.,
2007), we found across two different samples that highfunctioning, verbally fluent children with ASD struggled
with making predictions about future events based on their
single-event likelihoods. In contrast, our comparison group
of typically developing children were successful in making
such predictions, consistent with results obtained from
previous studies with infants and young children (Acredolo

2414

et al., 1989; Denison & Xu, 2010, 2014; Yost et al., 1962;
Zhu & Gigerenzer, 2006). The current findings are striking,
considering that the two groups of children in Experiment 2
did not differ in their Visual Spatial Index scores, which are
particularly relevant for processing the stimuli presented in
our task.
May our results be better accounted for by the three
dominant cognitive theories for ASD? While more research
would be necessary to carefully tease these accounts apart,
we have reason to believe that the current cognitive theories
do not necessarily do so. According to the theory-of-mind
hypothesis, the core deficit of autism is a failure/delay in
taking into account others’ mental states. Given that our task
does not ostensibly require participants to impute the mental
state of others, it is unlikely that the difference found in
probabilistic reasoning between the ASD and TD groups
would be related to any previously established differences in
ToM. With regards to the executive dysfunction hypothesis,
the high rate at which the ASD children were passing the
control task suggests that they had an ability to sustain
attention to the presented movies in the current study. It is
possible that this group of children appeared to respond
correctly on the control trial due to difficulties in inhibiting
the prepotent response of selecting the dissimilar object
exiting as the predicted outcome (i.e., choosing the picture
with one blue object outside of the container, rather than the
picture with one of the three identical yellow objects outside
of the container). However, if this alternative explanation
were to be true, then the ASD children should have
performed significantly worse than chance on the
experimental trials because of an equivalent tendency to
select the low-probability outcomes. Finally, the weak
central coherence theory posits that autism is characterized
by a weak drive towards obtaining global coherence, such
that individuals with autism are predisposed to process
information in a detail-focused, piecemeal way. Again, it is
unclear how such a theory would account for the different
success rate that children with ASD show on the
experimental trials vs. the control trials; how would
attending to the details of the movies in a segmented manner
lead children to pass the control but not the experimental
trials?
Therefore, our results suggest that there may be early
differences in probabilistic reasoning between children with
autism and typically developing children. This weakness in
intuitive statistics may result in impairments when making
inductive generalizations. That being said, it should be
noted that autism is an extremely complex phenomenon. We
do not think that the demonstrated weakness in probabilistic
reasoning is necessarily a defining factor for autism, or a
factor that would explain the full spectrum of autism
symptomatology. Instead, we speculate that this deficit may
be general to all learners who have difficulties with making
inductive generalizations. Given the centrality of inductive
learning in almost every domain, such early difficulties may
lead to a cascade of negative consequences in development,
and this would be the case whether with regards to children

with autism or children with other developmental disorders.
Work is ongoing in our lab to examine more closely the
deficit in probability prediction using other related tasks,
and whether the deficits in probabilistic reasoning may be
directly linked to deficits in the ability to make inductive
generalizations.
Finally, we note that the current work examines autism
through the lens of learning, which may allow its findings to
be more amendable to the design of interventions, an aspect
that is especially important to stakeholders of the ASD
community. As such, we believe that the current work is a
first step towards opening up new grounds in the study of
autism.
