Abstract

similar to networks is other domains, a small-world
structure, implying higher clustering and equal average path
length than found in random networks (Humphries &
Gurney, 2008; Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005; Watts &
Strogatz, 1998). However, whether this aggregate pattern
also characterizes the mental lexica of individuals is far
from understood. As a first step toward answering this
question, we will apply in this investigation a new network
inference method to study and compare the small worldness of younger and older adults’ mental lexica based on
verbal fluency data.

How does the mental lexicon, the network of learned words in
our semantic memory, change in old age? To address this
question, we employ a new network inference method to infer
networks from verbal fluency data of a group of younger and
older adults. We find that older adults produce more unique
words in verbal fluency tasks than younger adults. In line with
recent theorizing, this suggests a larger mental lexicon for
older than for younger adults. Moreover, we find that relative
to the mental lexicon of younger adults, the mental lexicon of
older adults is less small-world-like. Based on several
findings linking network clustering to processing speed, this
finding suggests that not only the size, but also the structure
of the mental lexicon may contribute to apparent cognitive
decline in old age.

The Aging Mental Lexicon
Semantic memory follows a unique developmental
trajectory across later age. Whereas episodic memory and
fluid abilities, such as working memory capacity, peak in
early adulthood, the performance of semantic memory, as
measured by vocabulary tests, increases until age 65 to 70
(Hartshorne & Germine, 2015; Keuleers, Stevens, Mandera,
& Brysbaert, 2015) or even beyond (Kavé & Halamish,
2015)1. Recently, it was argued that the positive trend for
semantic memory might actually be responsible for the poor
performance of older adults in other cognitive variables
(Ramscar, Hendrix, Shaoul, Milin, & Baayen, 2014).
Specifically, if older adults have access to an increasing
number of words, then their mental lexicon must be larger.
As with finding a book in a large as compared to a small
library, retrieving information from a large mental lexicon

Introduction
Cognitive science commonly depicts semantic memory as
a random walk traversing a network of concepts or words,
often called the mental lexicon (Abbot, Austerweil, Griffith,
2015; Anderson, 1983; Collins & Loftus, 1975; De Deyne,
Verheyen, & Storms, 2014; Hills, Todd, & Jones, 2012;
Miller, 1995; Vitevich, 2011). A corollary of this view is
that the structure of the network should impact memory
performance (Jones, Hills, Todd, 2015; Vitevich, 2008;
Borge-Holthoefer & Arenas, 2010). Several studies have
attempted to measure the mental lexicon using memory
productions from free association or natural language
(Ferrer-i-Cancho & Sole, 2001; Steyvers & Tenenbaum,
2005; Morais, Olssen, & Schooler, 2013). They concluded
that the macroscopic structure of the mental lexicon follows,

Moreover, linguistic analyses suggest that common vocabulary
tests underestimate the true vocabulary size for older adults
(Baayen, 2001).

should take more time and be more error prone, than in a
small mental lexicon. The apparent cognitive decline in
older adults – usually attributed to a general cognitive
slowing for older adults due to neuronal deterioration
(Light, 1991) – may thus arise from changes in older adults
mental lexica.
As size of the mental lexicon can impact the performance
of the memory system, so should its structure (Baronchelli,
Ferrer-i-Cancho, Pastor-Satorras, Chater, & Christiansen,
2013). Previous research has successfully connected a
network’s clustering coefficient to processing speed
(Nematzadeh, Ferrara, Flammini, & Ahn, 2014; Vitevich, et
al., 2011), enhanced priming effects (Nelson & Goodmon,
2002), as well as facilitated recognition and recall (Nelson,
Bennett, Gee, Schreiber, & McKinney, 1993; Nelson,
Zhang, & McKinley, 2001). Furthermore, the structure of
the mental lexicon is naturally related the meaning of words,
categorization, and language itself (Borge-Holthofer &
Arenas, 2010; De Deyne, Verheyen, & Storms, 2014; Jones
& Mewhort, 2007).
To our knowledge, no previous study assessed the effect
of aging on the structure of the mental lexicon. Existing
research rather focused on the early developmental
trajectory of the mental lexicon in children (e.g., Hills,
Maouene, Maouene, Sheya, & Smith, 2009; Beckage,
Smith, & Hills, 2011). Hills and colleagues (2009) found
evidence in favor of preferential acquisition process, in
which words are learned as a function the words’ degree of
connectedness in the learning environment. More research is
needed to corroborate this finding and it is unclear whether
these trends can be extrapolated to later life. We therefore
aim to help investigate the structural development of the
aging mental lexicon.

Data
The data for our analysis was comprised of 60 seconds
animal fluency data from a total of 332 participants. Verbal
fluency tests ask participants to list within a defined time
window as many members of a natural category as they can
think of. The dataset was composed of the data from two
independent studies, 228 (18.6 animals on average)
participants from Hills, Mata, Wilke, and Samanez-Larkin
(2013) and 104 participants (21.8 animals on average) from
a subsample from the Midlife in the United States study
(MIDUS; Lachman, Agrigoroaei, Tun, & Weaver, 2013).
The data of the latter was transcribed by us from audio
recordings using the Penn TotalRecall2 software. Following
Lerner, Ogrocki, and Thomas (2009), the datasets were
subjected to preprocessing, in which variants of the same
animal were combined (‘kitten’ and ‘kitty’), but alternate
forms of the same species were retained (‘cow’ and ‘calf’).
We removed 36 participants for low scores on a dementia
screener (value < 26; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975)
and 16 for producing too few animals (n < 10). A total of
284 participants entered the analysis, with age ranging from
29 to 94 and number of produced animals from 10 to 39.
Figure 1 illustrates the sample. For the comparison of older
and younger adults we performed a median split on age,
resulting in a group of 142 younger adults, aged 29 to 65,
producing on average 22 animals, and a group of 142 older
adults, aged 66 to 94, producing on average 18.8 animals
(see also Table 1).

In this investigation we provide a first peek into the
mental lexicon’s adult development by comparing mental
lexica of younger and older adults as inferred from verbal
fluency data. Doing this we will focus on the average local
clustering coefficient, the average shortest path length, and
the small world-ness of young and older adults’ semantic
networks. Out of the many network statistics, the clustering
coefficient is most prominent. It is also the only network
statistic that has been causally connected to memory
performance (Vitevich et al., 2011). The average shortest
path length has not been linked to memory performance,
however, it carries an intuitive interpretation: Networks with
larger average shortest path lengths should lead to slower
and less flexible recall performance. Finally, as a composite
measure of the clustering coefficient and the average
shortest path length, small world-ness speaks to the global
structure of a network. Many natural occurring networks
exhibit a small world structure, including importantly word
occurrences in natural language (Ferrer-i-Cancho & Solé,
2001). Small world networks have been found to “display
enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power,
and synchronizability” (Watts & Strogatz, 1998, p. 440).

(b), a non-weighted, undirected graph is created from the
pairs that co-occurred more often than a minimum threshold
of m. For example, if m = 2, then all pairs of words that cooccurred at least twice entered the final step of the analysis.
Finally, in the third step (c), the recorded frequency of cooccurrence is tested against the random expectation based
on the marginal frequencies of words and the lengths of the
verbal fluency sequences3. Specifically, an edge between a
pair of nodes is retained whenever likelihood of the
frequency of co-occurrence under the random model
surpasses a lower threshold c. As can be seen in the example
given, in the bottom panel of Figure 2 the method produces
highly intuitive networks. The network shown is based on
the older adults data and w = 3, m = 3, and c = .05.
Relative to other methods that are used to construct
networks from verbal fluency data, our method has two
important advantages. First, it is the only method based on
the common contention that related words co-occur within
relatively small window sizes, often no more than two or
three words apart (Abbot et al., 2015; Troyer et al., 1997;
Hills, Jones, & Todd, 2012, Wulff, Hills, & Hertwig, 2013).
Second, the flexible parameterization allows to map
different parts of the mental lexicon. Specifically, increasing
the minimum co-occurrence parameter m means that only
the strongly connected core network will be assessed
(Baronchelli et al., 2013). A similar case can be made for
the window size parameter w.
A critical aspect of investigations into the macroscopic
properties of networks is statistical inference. When the
endpoint of the investigation is a single network, one cannot
rely on standard statistical procedures. Often the only
possibility to generate standard errors lies in bootstrap
methods that repeatedly construct subnetworks from
randomly selected nodes and edges. The reliability of such
methods is, however, contested (Sneijders & Borgatti,
1999). To circumvent these issues, we chose to bootstrap
participants instead of subnetworks. Specifically, we
inferred as many networks as there were participants in a
group according to a leave-one-out procedure (Efron &
Efron, 1982; Sneijders & Borgatti, 1999). We then
compared network measures between the groups based on
the pooled standard deviations computed across the 142
leave-one-out-networks for each of the groups.

Network Measures
Network Inference Method

We focus in our analyses on the two network measures
constituting a small world: The average (local) clustering
coefficient and the average shortest path length. The
clustering coefficient C, sometimes also called transitivity,
refers to the proportion of cases in which the neighbors of a
node are neighbors themselves. The shortest path length of
two nodes L refers to the length of the shortest possible way
to traverse from one node to the other. The average
clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length

To infer the mental lexicon of younger and older adults
from verbal fluency data, we borrow from the statistical
procedure developed by Goñi et al. (2011). The method
assesses for every two words whether they co-occur more
frequently than would be expected by chance. Figure 2
illustrates the three steps of the procedure. In the first step
(a), a window of size w moves through all verbal fluency
sequences of one group and records the number of times
two words co-occur within the window. For instance, if w =
3, then all pairs of words with no more than one intervening
word entered the next step of the analysis. In the second step

are both computed as the arithmetic mean of their respective
measures.
To counter known dependencies of the clustering
coefficient and the shortest path length on the size and
connectedness of the network (von Wijk, Stam, &
Daffertshofer, 2010), we measure both variables relative the
expectations of a Erdos-Renyi random graph (Bollobas,
2001). In addition, to prevent influences from the outset of
the analysis, we match the data of younger and older adults.
Specifically, we implemented the following matching
scheme: First, we included older and younger adults with
exact matches in samples size of fluency productions.
Second, for all participants that could not be matched in the
first round, we identified for each older adult the younger
counterpart whose number of productions lay closest,
cropped the extra productions at the end produced by the
young adult, and included the pair. The matched data
included 5230 productions, representing about 90% of the
original 5802 productions. All of the following results hold
for an alternative matching scheme in which young adults’
extra productions were cropped at the beginning.
We also include in our analysis the small-world-ness
index S developed by Humphries and Gurney (2008). This
measures combines the clustering coefficient and the
average shortest path into a single metric, while controlling

First, we turn to the number of unique productions.
Although younger adults produced slightly more unique
animals in total, older adults produced more unique items
per production, which was both, significant and substantial,
according to a bootstrap test (d = -1.9, p < .001). This
finding is consistent with the idea that a larger mental
lexicon slows the productions of older adults (Ramscar et
al., 2012).

levels of the minimum co-occurrence parameter m, five
levels of the window size parameter w, and a single criterion
value of c = .05. The left two columns show the results for
the younger (YA) and older adults (OA), while the
rightmost column displays their difference. The figure only
displays boxes when a giant components comprised of at
least 90% of all nodes could be recovered, and numbers,
when the statistical test yielded significance at the level of
.05.
As can be seen from the figure, the networks and their
differences across groups are markedly influenced by the
choice of minimum co-occurrence, but not window size.
Specifically, the analysis of all data, including pairs of
words that only co-occurred once, resulted in about 20%
larger networks for the older adults than for the younger
adults. Responsible for this pattern is that, consistent with
more unique productions for older adults, the older adults
frequency distribution of productions has a longer tail of
highly infrequent items. Under most circumstances, such
infrequent items will likely form unique pairs with the
words they are paired with. As it is impossible to discern
whether such pairings are the result of a systematic
association between the words or mere chance, we followed
Goñi et al. (2011) in disregarded co-occurrences that
occurred no more than once (m ≥ 2).
Evaluating the networks for m ≥ 2 revealed a very clear
pattern: The networks of younger adults exhibit more
clustering, mostly shorter average path lengths and mostly
larger small-world-ness indices. This suggests that the
structure of the younger adults mental lexicon resembles
more closely a small world structure than that of older
adults.

to the underlying structure. This holds in particular as it has
been proposed that the search process is affected by age
(Hills et al., 2013). Future studies should aim to disentangle
search process and network, possibly by means of
simulation. Future studies should also aim to corroborate the
present findings by extending the analysis of mental
networks to other methods (e.g., similarity ratings) and
content (e.g., other natural categories).

Discussion
To our knowledge our investigation represents the first
comprehensive comparison of younger and older adults
mental lexica. Consistent with previous research (Ramscar
et al., 2014), we have shown that relative to younger adults,
older adults produce more unique words in the verbal
fluency task, suggesting a larger underlying mental lexicon.
Critically, we have also shown that relative to the mental
lexicon of younger adults, the mental lexicon of older adults
exhibits a less small-world-like structure, implying less
clustering. Based on previous findings that associate
network clustering with processing speed (e.g.,
Nematzadeh, Ferrara, Flammini, & Ahn, 2014), this result
suggests that the structure of the mental lexicon of older
adults might contribute to the apparent cognitive decline in
old age.
The inference of a mental lexicon from memory
productions is, however, not without caveats. Most
importantly, one must consider that memory productions are
the process not only of the underlying network, but also a
search process operating on the network (Jones, Hills, &
Todd, 2015; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981). This means that
one cannot easily attribute differences in inferred networks
