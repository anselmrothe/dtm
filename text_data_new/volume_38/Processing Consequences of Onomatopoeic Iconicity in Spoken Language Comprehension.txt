Abstract
Iconicity is a fundamental feature of human language.
However its processing consequences at the behavioral and
neural level in spoken word comprehension are not well
understood. The current paper presents the behavioral and
electrophysiological outcome of an auditory lexical decision
task in which native speakers of Dutch listened to
onomatopoeic words and matched control words while their
electroencephalogram
was
recorded.
Behaviorally,
onomatopoeic words were processed as quickly and
accurately as words with an arbitrary mapping between form
and meaning. Event-related potentials time-locked to word
onset revealed a significant decrease in negative amplitude in
the N2 and N400 components and a late positivity for
onomatopoeic words in comparison to the control words.
These findings advance our understanding of the temporal
dynamics of iconic form-meaning mapping in spoken word
comprehension and suggest interplay between the neural
representations of real-world sounds and spoken words.

Introduction
Language comprehension involves the mapping of forms
onto meaning representations. In spoken Indo-European
languages, the relation between word form and meaning is
often opaque and arbitrary. For instance, the French word
form arbre and the English word form tree do not resemble
the actual referent that these words denote (De Saussure,
1916). However, word forms can also be iconic of their
meaning and thereby render the form-meaning mapping
largely non-arbitrary. One example is the existence of
onomatopoeic words, such as beep, click, and slurp in
English, in which the phonological word form resembles the
real-world sound it refers to. Other examples of iconic
manners of signification in language can be found in
ideophones and mimetics (Dingemanse, 2012; Kita, 1997),
in the iconic hand gestures people produce in temporal and
semantic alignment with their speech (Kendon, 2004;
McNeill, 1992), and in many lexical items in sign languages
(Taub, 2001; Thompson, 2011). Current theorizing therefore
considers not only arbitrariness but also iconicity a
fundamental feature of language (Dingemanse, Blasi,
Lupyan, Christiansen, & Monaghan, 2015; Imai & Kita,
2014; Perniss, Thompson, & Vigliocco, 2010; Perniss &
Vigliocco, 2014).
In line with its appraisal as a fundamental property of
language, several studies have started investigating the
processing consequences of iconicity. The majority of
studies investigating the role of iconicity in the processing

of existing lexical items focuses on sign language (see
Perniss et al., 2010; Vinson, Thompson, Skinner, &
Vigliocco, 2015). Results are mixed. In lexical decision
tasks native signers do not recognize iconic signs at a
different speed or accuracy compared to signs with an
arbitrary form-meaning mapping (Bosworth & Emmorey,
2010; Klann, Kastrau, & Huber, 2005), which suggests that
iconicity does not convey a lexical processing advantage
(Bosworth & Emmorey, 2010). In contrast, a facilitatory
role of iconicity has been found in picture-sign matching
tasks and in picture naming (Grote & Linz, 2003; Ormel,
Hermans, Knoors, & Verhoeven, 2009; Thompson, Vinson,
& Vigliocco, 2009; Vinson et al., 2015), which suggests that
a close mapping between the form and meaning of a lexical
item can aid lexical retrieval (Thompson et al. 2009).
The processing consequences of iconicity at the
behavioral and neural level in spoken language remain
largely unclear and much of the work done has used nonwords as stimuli (see Lockwood & Dingemanse, 2015). At
the behavioral level, studies have followed up on and
replicated Köhler’s (1929) observation that people associate
non-words containing voiceless stops (e.g., takete or kiki)
with spiky shapes and non-words without voiceless stops or
containing only continuant consonants (e.g., maluma or
bouba) with curvy shapes (Köhler, 1929; Ramachandran &
Hubbard, 2001; Westbury, 2005). At the neurophysiological
level, it was found that the brain is sensitive to the sound
symbolic congruency between an auditorily presented nonword label and a subsequently presented visual object as
early as 160 ms after onset of the visual object, reflected by
a significant increase in negative amplitude of an eventrelated potential (ERP) component in the N2 time-window
for congruent compared to incongruent sound symbolic
mappings (Kovic, Plunkett, & Westermann, 2010).
However, such consistent associations between the acoustic
and phonological characteristics of non-words and the shape
of objects are interesting, but do not necessarily imply that
people process existing iconic lexical items such as
onomatopoeic words differently than words with an
arbitrary form-meaning mapping.
Neuroimaging studies suggest that the brain represents
existing iconic words such as ideophones and onomatopoeic
words qualitatively differently compared to non-iconic
words. Listening to onomatopoeic words recruits both brain
areas involved in the processing of verbal sounds and areas
processing non-verbal (animal) sounds (Hashimoto, Usui,
Taira, Nose, Haji, et al., 2006). More specifically, additional
activation in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus
(pSTS) for comprehending iconic words compared to noniconic words may reflect that iconic words function as both

1637

linguistic and non-linguistic symbols (Kanero, Imai, Okuda,
Okada, & Matsuda, 2014). These findings thus suggest
differences in representation for iconic words compared to
words with an arbitrary form-meaning mapping due to the
former's connection to sensory information and everyday
sensory experience. A performance benefit in auditory
lexical decision for onomatopoeic words compared to noniconic control words in patients with aphasia indeed
suggests that iconic word forms may activate their meaning
partially via non-linguistic pathways (Meteyard, Stoppard,
Snudden, Cappa, & Vigliocco, 2015).
The aim of the current study is to further investigate the
processing consequences of iconicity at the behavioral and
neurophysiological level in spoken word comprehension, by
focusing on onomatopoeia as the textbook example of
iconicity
in
spoken
Indo-European
languages.
Onomatopoeic words recruit a different set of brain regions
compared to non-iconic words (Hashimoto et al., 2006), but
the behavioral consequences of iconicity in the processing
of spoken words remain unclear. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these differential patterns of neuronal
activation remain unknown. Therefore, in the current study
both reaction times and the electroencephalogram (EEG)
were recorded while participants performed an auditory
lexical decision task that contained onomatopoeic words
and matched control words. If iconicity aids in lexical
retrieval (cf. Thompson et al., 2009), this may be reflected
by faster response times (RTs), higher accuracy, and a less
negative deflection in the N400 component for
onomatopoeic words compared to control words.
Conversely, if iconicity does not convey a lexical
processing advantage (cf. Bosworth & Emmorey, 2010) no
such effects should be observed. If onomatopoeic words are
more effortful to process compared to control words
(similarly to ideophones, cf. Lockwood & Tuomainen,
2015), this may lead to slower RTs, lower accuracy, and a
late positive effect in the ERPs (Lockwood & Tuomainen,
2015). Finally, if the findings by Kovic et al. (2010)
generalize to onomatopoeic iconicity, a difference in
amplitude of the N2 component may be expected for
onomatopoeic words versus control words.

Method
Participants
Thirty-four native speakers of Dutch (28 female; 18-29
years of age, mean age = 22.2) participated in the combined
RT and EEG study for monetary reward. They were all
right-handed as assessed by a Dutch translation of the
Edinburgh Inventory for hand dominance (Oldfield, 1971),
had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no history of
neurological insult or language disability. Data from three
participants was excluded from behavioral and EEG
analyses due to an error percentage on the behavioral task
that exceeded 20%.

Stimulus Materials
Both RTs and ERPs were recorded to 320 trials that
consisted of 160 words (40 Dutch onomatopoeic words, 40
Dutch control words, and 80 Dutch fillers) and 160 Dutchlike nonwords. All 160 words were selected from the
SUBTLEX-NL database via the online interface (Keuleers,
Brysbaert, & New, 2010; http://crr.ugent.be/isubtlex/).
Before recording the stimuli, the onomatopoeic words were
matched as carefully and strictly as possible with the control
words on a large range of lexical characteristics including
word length (i.e., number of graphemes, phonemes, and
syllables), frequency (word, lemma, and bigram), dominant
lexical class (all taken from SUBTLEX-NL), orthographic
and phonological neighborhood density (Coltheart N as
taken from Brysbaert, Stevens, Mandera, & Keuleers, in
press), age of acquisition, and concreteness (taken from
Brysbaert, Stevens, De Deyne, Voorspoels, & Storms,
2014). Separate t-tests for each lexical characteristic
confirmed that onomatopoeic words and control words did
not differ on any of the lexical variables. The 80 fillers were
added to keep the proportion of onomatopoeic words
presented in the experiment low and to keep the number of
nouns and verbs in the experiment similar. As confirmed by
the results of a post-experimental questionnaire, this kept
the purpose of the experiment unclear to all participants.
The 160 Dutch-like nonword stimuli were derived from
unused Dutch nouns and verbs that were also taken from
SUBTLEX-NL. Nonwords were constructed by Wuggy
(Keuleers & Brysbaert, 2010) by changing one to four
letters of these existing Dutch words, in line with Dutch
orthotactics. Appendix A shows the critical stimuli
(onomatopoeic words and control words).
The 320 stimuli were spoken at a normal rate by a female
native speaker of Dutch, recorded in a sound proof booth,
and digitized at a sample frequency of 44.1 kHz. They were
equalized in maximum amplitude using Praat software
(version 5.2.46; Boersma, 2001). Average stimulus duration
was 816 ms (SD = 148). There was no difference in duration
between onomatopoeic words (M = 721 ms, SD = 98) and
control words (M = 723 ms, SD = 96).

Rating for Iconicity
To check whether the onomatopoeic words were indeed
judged to be more iconic than the control words, 12 native
speakers of Dutch (11 female, 18-24 years of age, mean age
= 21.1), who did not participate in the main experiment,
were asked to rate the 160 word stimuli (i.e. the
onomatopoeic words, control words, and fillers) for
iconicity. They were seated in a soundproof booth in front
of a computer screen. Words were presented to them one at
a time via headphones in a randomized way. On the screen
they saw a Likert-scale from 1 to 7 where 1 indicated "not
iconic at all" (helemaal niet iconisch in Dutch) and 7
indicated "very iconic" (heel erg iconisch in Dutch). Prior to
the start of the rating procedure, instructions explaining the
notion iconicity (similar to Meteyard et al., 2015) were
presented on the screen. Onomatopoeic words (M = 4.83,

1638

SD = 0.53) were rated as significantly more iconic than
control words (M = 2.15, SD = 0.77), t (11) = 11.04, p <
.001.

Procedure
After completing informed consent, participants in the main
experiment were seated in a comfortable chair at a distance
of 100 cm in front of a computer monitor in a shielded,
dimly illuminated room. The experiment was programmed
using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems).
Spoken stimuli were presented through EEG-compatible
headphones. Before the start of the experiment, written
instructions were presented on the screen. Participants were
instructed that they would hear spoken stimuli. They were
asked to carefully listen to the stimuli and to indicate by
pressing a button with the left or right index finger whether
the presented item was an existing Dutch word (right finger)
or not (left finger). They were asked to make their decisions
as quickly and as accurately as possible. Also, they were
asked to blink their eyes only when a specific symbol was
presented on the screen.
A trial consisted of a fixation cross (200 ms), followed by
the spoken stimulus (M = 816 ms) paired with a blank
screen (2000 ms in total), followed by a symbol (- -) during
which participants could blink their eyes (2000 ms). The
response deadline was set to 2000 ms. Responses given after
this deadline were considered as errors. The experiment
consisted of two blocks of 160 stimuli. Between the blocks
participants could have a pause for as long as they wanted.
Ten test-items with the same characteristics as the stimuli
preceded the main experiment as a practice set.

EEG recording and analysis
The
electroencephalogram
(EEG)
was
recorded
continuously from 59 active electrodes held in place on the
scalp by an elastic cap. In addition to the 59 scalp sites,
three external electrodes were attached to record EOG, one
below the left eye (to monitor for vertical eye
movement/blinks), and two on the lateral canthi next to the
left and right eye (to monitor for horizontal eye
movements/saccades). Finally, one electrode was placed
over the left mastoid bone and one over the right mastoid
bone. All electrode impedances were kept below 20 KΩ.
The continuous EEG was recorded with a sampling rate of
500 Hz, a low cut-off filter of 0.01 Hz and a high cut-off
filter of 200 Hz. EEG was filtered offline (high-pass at 0.01
Hz and low-pass at 40 Hz). All electrode sites were online
referenced to the electrode placed over the left mastoid and
re-referenced offline to the average of the right and left
mastoids.
ERPs were calculated by averaging the EEG time-locked
to a point 100 ms pre-stimulus onset and lasting until 800
ms after the onset of the stimulus. The 100 ms pre-stimulus
period was used as a baseline. Trials defined as errors or
outliers in the behavioral analyses, and trials containing
ocular or muscular artifacts, were not taken into
consideration in the averaging process. After removal of

trials containing errors, outliers, and artifacts, 87.1% of
trials entered the ERP analyses (86.9% of onomatopoeic
trials; 87.2% of control word trials). Separate ERPs were
computed for the onomatopoeic words and the control
words. An approach to data analysis was applied in which
the head surface is divided into four quadrants and a vertical
midline column of 9 electrodes each, yielding five regions
(left anterior, LA; right anterior, RA; left posterior, LP; and
right posterior, RP; and the midline column, Midline; see
Peeters, Hagoort, & Özyürek, 2015).
The mean amplitudes of the ERP waveforms for each
condition per subject were entered into repeated measures
ANOVAs with factors Iconicity (2: onomatopoeic words,
control words) and Region (5: LA, RA, LP, RP, Midline).
Based on the considerations outlined in the Introduction, byparticipant analyses were performed on the N2 component
(150-200 ms after word onset), the N400 component (350550 ms after word onset), and a late positive time-window
(600-800 ms after word onset).

Results
Behavioral (RT and error) analyses
Of the total raw dataset, 5.32 % were errors (wrong
responses and responses given after the RT deadline) and
therefore removed. In addition, RTs outside the range of 2.5
standard deviations above the participant’s mean were
considered outliers and were excluded from the analyses
(2.26 % of all data). Analyses of variance were performed
on the mean RTs and mean error rate per experimental
condition in the participant analyses (F1), and on the mean
RT and mean error rate per item in the item analyses (F2).
Iconicity (onomatopoeic words vs. control words) was a
within-participant factor in the participant analyses and a
between-item variable in the item analyses.

Overall, onomatopoeic words (M = 1006 ms) were
responded to numerically faster than control words (M =
1017 ms). However, the analysis on the mean RTs showed
no significant main effect of Iconicity, F1 (1, 30) = 2.39, p =
.132; F2 (1, 78) < 1. Overall, participants made numerically
more errors to onomatopoeic words (M = 4.68 %) than to
control words (M = 3.95 %). However, also in the error
analyses no significant main effect of Iconicity was found,

1639

F1 (1, 30) < 1; F2 (1, 78) < 1. Thus, no behavioral
differences were found between onomatopoeic words and
control words in auditory lexical decision. Table 1 shows
the mean RT and the mean error rate for each condition.

Electrophysiological analyses
As can be seen in Figure 1, the onomatopoeic words yielded
a decrease in amplitude of the N2 component, a less
negative-going N400 component, and a late positive
deflection compared to the control words.
N2 time-window (150-200 ms). The repeated measures
ANOVA in the N2 time-window with factors Iconicity (2)
and Region (5) showed a significant main effect of
Iconicity, F (1, 30) = 6.51, p = .016, p2 = .178. This effect
was not modulated by Region (F < 1).
N400 time-window (350-550 ms). The repeated measures
ANOVA showed a significant main effect of Iconicity, F (1,
30) = 5.46, p = .026, p2 = .154. This effect was not
modulated by Region (F < 1).
Late time-window (600-800 ms). The repeated measures
ANOVA showed a significant main effect of Iconicity, F (1,
30) = 4.43, p = .044, p2 = .129. This effect was not
modulated by Region (F < 1).

spoken word onset for a frontal (Fz), a central (Cz), and a

electrophysiological response to onomatopoeic words (black

plots show the voltage differences between the two
conditions over the scalp for the N2 effect (150-200 ms), the
N400 effect (350-550 ms), and the late positivity (600-800
ms).

Discussion
The current study investigated the processing consequences
of iconicity at the behavioral and neurophysiological level
in spoken word comprehension. It was found that
onomatopoeic words were processed as quickly and
accurately as words with an arbitrary mapping between
form and meaning. Event-related potentials showed a
significant decrease in negative amplitude in the N2 and

N400 components and a late positivity for onomatopoeic
words in comparison to the control words.
The behavioral results are in line with findings from
lexical decision tasks in sign language research, which have
shown that native signers do not recognize iconic signs at a
different speed or accuracy compared to signs with an
arbitrary form-meaning mapping (Bosworth & Emmorey,
2010; Klann et al., 2005). Such findings suggested that
iconicity does not convey a lexical processing advantage
(Bosworth & Emmorey, 2010). However, the time it takes
to make a lexical decision by pressing one of two buttons
reflects more than lexical processing alone, as it also
involves a decision component and the preparation and
execution of a motor response. A more direct measure of
processing ease may be the amplitude of the N400
component, particularly when words are presented in
isolation. Similar to effects of word frequency on the
amplitude of the N400 (Allen, Badecker, & Osterhout,
2003; Van Petten & Kutas, 1990), the decrease in negative
amplitude for onomatopoeic words compared to control
words suggests facilitated access to the lexicon (Lau,
Phillips, & Poeppel, 2008) in case of an iconic mapping
between form and meaning (cf. Thompson et al., 2009;
Vinson et al., 2015).
This presumed ease of mapping form to meaning for
onomatopoeic words as reflected in decreased negative
amplitude of the N400 component may even be related to
the facilitatory effect of higher word frequency in spoken
word comprehension, if one takes into account people's
everyday sensory experience of perceiving linguistic and
non-linguistic (real-world) sounds. In everyday life people
not only encounter onomatopoeic words like beep, click,
and slurp in speech, but they also hear the beeps their alarm
clock makes, the clicking of their pen, and the slurping
sounds of their partner eating soup - sounds that acoustically
resemble their onomatopoeic verbal counterpart (Assaneo,
Nichols, & Trevisan, 2011). This is not the case for noniconic words like throw and write - the word write does not
acoustically resemble the sounds produced by the process of
writing. People's experiences with hearing real-world nonlinguistic sounds are (understandably) not taken into
account by measures of lexical frequency in
psycholinguistic databases, thereby underestimating the
frequency with which onomatopoeic sounds (i.e. the sum of
verbal and non-verbal experiences) are encountered in
everyday life.
But why then did onomatopoeic words not yield faster
reaction times than control words? One possible explanation
is again related to the fact that onomatopoeic words are so
strongly linked to real-world sounds. In an fMRI study,
Hashimoto et al. (2006) found that listening to
onomatopoeic words recruits brain areas involved in the
processing of both verbal sounds and non-verbal sounds.
Along similar lines, Kanero et al. (2014) suggested that
additional activation in the right posterior superior temporal
sulcus (pSTS) for comprehending iconic words compared to
non-iconic words reflects that iconic words function as both

1640

linguistic and non-linguistic symbols (see Thierry, Giraud,
& Price, 2003). The dual nature of onomatopoeic words,
activating both linguistic representations and non-linguistic
real-world sound representations, may lead to a conflict
when a lexical decision has to be performed on these
stimuli.
Non-iconic
words
are
arguably
more
unambiguously identifiable as lexical items than iconic
words that have a strong non-lexical component. At the
behavioral level, this may cancel out the earlier benefit for
onomatopoeic words as indicated by the N400 difference,
yielding statistically similar response times for
onomatopoeic and control words in lexical decision.
Because of its timing and directionality, it could be that the
late positivity in the ERPs reflects this enhanced difficulty
in making a post-lexical meta-linguistic decision for
onomatopoeic words (see e.g. Holcomb, Grainger, &
O'Rourke, 2002).
In addition to the N400 effect and the late positivity, an
early difference between onomatopoeic words and control
words was found in the amplitude of the N2 component.
Notably the directionality of this effect was opposite to the
directionality of the effect reported by Kovic et al. (2010) in
which congruent (compared to incongruent) sound symbolic
mappings elicited larger amplitude in the N2 time-window.
This difference in directionality of the effect may be due to
the difference in stimuli used across the two studies. Kovic
et al. (2010) focused on cross-modal mappings between an
auditorily presented non-word label and a subsequently
presented visual object. The current study used existing
onomatopoeic words, i.e. verbal sounds that refer to nonverbal sounds - all within the auditory modality.
As outlined above, fMRI evidence suggests that hearing
an onomatopoeic word activates not only brain areas
involved in the processing of verbal sounds, but also (righthemisphere) areas such as right pSTS involved in
processing real-world sounds, outside of the canonical
language network (Hashimoto et al., 2006; Kanero et al.,
2014). The N2 effect in the current study not only confirms
that onomatopoeic words are indeed processed qualitatively
differently from non-iconic control words, but also suggests
that the patterns of activation for iconic and non-iconic
words start to diverge already during early stages of spoken
word comprehension. Similar early effects of iconicity have
been observed in the visual domain for ideophones
(Lockwood & Tuomainen, 2015). These early processing
differences may even be enhanced in everyday
communication for words that have marked iconic
properties such as reduplication and lengthening of syllables
through which they stand out from other words
(Dingemanse, 2012; Lockwood & Tuomainen, 2015) as
naturally occurring auditory oddball stimuli.
To sum up, the current study found that at the behavioral
level onomatopoeic words were processed as quickly and
accurately as words with an arbitrary mapping between
form and meaning. Complementing neuroimaging studies,
decreased amplitude of the N2 component of the ERP for
onomatopoeic words suggested activation differences

between onomatopoeic words and control words during
early stages of spoken word comprehension. The link
between linguistic and sensory experience in the case of
onomatopoeia may lead to facilitated form-meaning
mapping, but render lexical decision more difficult in
healthy participants. These findings are consistent with the
view that the neuronal architecture supporting language
comprehension is not an encapsulated entity but interacts
with the neuronal infrastructure engaged in auditory
perception more broadly.
