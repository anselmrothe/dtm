Abstract
In this paper, we explore the cultural differences in the
production of speech and speech+gesture combinations by
infants at the age of 17-18 months in Mozambique and the
Netherlands. We found that Dutch infants produce more
speech and gestures compared to Mozambican infants. Infants
in both communities make most use of content words. The
results further show that Dutch infants make more use of
proximal pointing than Mozambicans, whereas Mozambicans
make more use of the offering gesture. Finally, the amount of
semantically coherent speech+gesture combinations of the
Mozambican infants is higher than of the Dutch infants.

Introduction
For infants in the early stages of language, gestures can
allow them to express certain thoughts at a time they may be
unable to express those thoughts fully in the spoken
modality (Butcher & Goldin-Meadow, 2000; GoldinMeadow & Butcher, 2003). Additionally, early gesture use
in infants has been found to be a predictor of their later
language development (Rowe, Özçalışkan & GoldinMeadow, 2006, 2008). Despite the importance of gestures
for language development, little knowledge is available
about the use of (co-speech) gestures by infants in a crosscultural perspective, especially in non-Western societies. In
this paper we investigate the amount of speech and cospeech gestures produced by infants in two cultures.
Additionally, we investigate the relation between different
kinds of gestures and accompanying speech.
It is well established that there are considerable individual
and cross-cultural differences in the language-learning
environment of children (Hoff, 2006). For instance,
concerning the amount of infant-directed speech (IDS;
Lieven, 1994), the communicative intentions of IDS
(LeVine et al., 1994; Vogt, Mastin & Schots, 2015) and
style of co-speech gestures addressed to infants (Gogate,
Maganti, & Bahrick, 2015; Tamis-LeMonda, Song, Leavell,
Kahana-Kalman, & Yoshikawa, 2012). Similar results have
been found concerning the influence of socio-economic
status on the language environment of children (Hart &
Risley, 1995; Rowe & Goldin-Meadow, 2009). Moreover,
the various differences concerning the input to children have
been found to affect children's development of language and
other communicative skills (Hart & Risley, 1995; Rowe &
Goldin-Meadow, 2009; Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2012).
However, while such cultural differences concerning the

learning environment of children are well known, they
mostly concern the verbal environment or more Westernized
cultures. Still little is known about (the role of) gestural
communication in children ('s learning environments) from
non-Western societies, such as those from Africa.
Studies have shown that the amount of gestural input, just
like vocal input, varies across sociocultural settings and is
not just dependent of SES or parents educational level
(Callaghan et al., 2011; Iverson, Capirci, Volterra, &
Goldin-Meadow, 2008; Salomo & Liszkowski, 2013; Vogt
& Mastin, 2013). A recent observational study from
Mozambique has obtained some novel insights. For
instance, it was found that infants in urban Mozambique
were stimulated much more frequently compared to infants
from rural Mozambique across their whole gesture
repertoire and were exposed to three times as much speech
and co-speech gestures, which correlated to differences
found in their vocabulary development (Vogt & Mastin,
2013). Also the communicative intentions of IDS differ
considerably between the Netherlands, and urban and rural
Mozambique (Vogt, et al., 2015). In particular, IDS in the
Netherlands contained more utterances with a cognitive
intention, whereas IDS in urban Mozambique contained
more utterances with a socio-emotional intention, and IDS
in rural Mozambique contained most of the imperatives.
Additionally, the amount of IDS in the Netherlands was
almost twice as much as the input in urban Mozambique,
and about ten times as much as in rural Mozambique (Vogt
et al., 2015).
The observed differences correspond to differences in
caregiving practices between the communities, which can be
explained based on lifestyles of the different socio-cultural
communities (Keller, 2012). In a Western context, parents
focus more on the cognitive development of the infant, such
as language development. In a non-Western context the
focus is more on situation-oriented socialization, with more
attention for the development of motoric skills.
It is well established that the input in speech and gesture
tends to correlate with children's development of speech and
gesture (Hart & Risley, 1995; Iverson et al., 2008; Rowe &
Goldin-Meadow, 2009; Salomo & Liszkowski, 2013). We
therefore expect that the observed differences in the input to
infants from the Netherlands and Mozambique will reflect
differences in the production of speech and gesture between
infants from the Netherlands and Mozambique. However,
little is known about how infants in non-Western
communities produce gesture and speech in everyday
communication.
Salomo and Liszkowski (2013) have shown that the
gesture productions of infants from the Netherlands, China

1116

and a Mayan culture varied considerably with Chinese
infants producing most gestures, followed by Dutch and
Mayan infants. Assessing another three cultures (Canada,
Peru and India) in a pointing task, Callaghan et al. (2011)
found that significantly more Canadian infants produced
declarative pointing gestures compared to Indian infants of
the same age, while the number of Peruvian infants who
pointed was in between.
The amount of gestures infants produce predicts the early
stages of their spoken language development. Rowe et al.
(2006; 2008) have shown that parents’ use of gestures did
not directly influence children’s vocabulary size at 42
months. However, parental gesture use did influence the
amount of gestures produced by infants at 14 months, which
in turn was a significant predictor of vocabulary
development at 42 months. Moreover, Rowe and GoldinMeadow (2009a) found that children from low SES families
produced fewer gestures than children from high SES
families, which related to their parents’ gestural input.
Children's gesture production is of importance since it
does not only predict later vocabulary size, but is also
involved in other developmental milestones, like the onset
of the two-word stage. Children who are unable to express
two words within one utterance can make use of a
speech+gesture combination to express a two-word idea
(Butcher & Goldin-Meadow, 2000; Goldin-Meadow &
Butcher, 2003; Rowe & Goldin-Meadow, 2009b). The age
at which children start to produce these speech+gesture
combinations predicts the onset of two-word utterances
(Iverson, et al., 2008; Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005;
Rowe & Goldin-Meadow, 2009b). Speech+gesture
combinations conveying different information were found to
emerge prior to the onset of two-word combinations for all
cultures studied so far (Goldin-Meadow, 2009; Iverson et
al., 2008; Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005), but these do
not include non-Western cultures.
The purpose of this paper is to explore the cultural
differences in the speech and gestures infants produce at the
age of 17-18 months. In particular, we compare the speech
and gesture production of children from middle-class
families in the Netherlands with children from low SES
families in urban Mozambique. We assess infants' amounts
and semantic categories of speech in combination with
gesture production, as well as the mean length of utterances
and speech+gesture utterances they produce. While
investigating the relation of these differences with other
developmental milestones, such as vocabulary development
or the onset of two-word utterances, would be interesting,
this is left for future research.

Methods
Participants and field sites
This study was based on data from earlier research of
Mastin and Vogt (2016) and Vogt et al. (2015). The data
consists of video recordings of infants in the Netherlands
and urban Mozambique at three different ages, when infants

were 1;1, 1;6 and 2;1 years old. For the purpose of the
present study, only data recorded at 1;6 was used. Since the
infants in rural Mozambique did not express many gestures
and speech at the age of 1;6, that field site was excluded.

The field site in urban Mozambique was made up of two
adjacent residential suburbs in Maputo. The community is
relatively poor, with low parental education, and is has a
market-based lifestyle. The Dutch sample consists of highly
educated, native Dutch families living in the Tilburg region.
The sample reflects a typical Western, middle-class, postmodern urban community that has a knowledge-based
lifestyle.
The results reported here are from 11 infants from the
Dutch community and 11 from urban Mozambique. The
average age at the time of recording was 1;5.10 years (Table
1). In Mozambique, local research assistants explained the
general purpose and recording procedures of the study to the
families in their native language (Portuguese or Changana).
In the Netherlands this was done by one of the researchers.
Signed informed consent forms were obtained from the
infants’ mothers. Table 1 shows some basic demographics
of our sample. For more details consult Vogt et al. (2015).

Data collection procedures
The families were visited at their home. During those
visits naturalistic interactions were recorded of infants’
daily, social environment by instructing those people who
were present to carry on with what they were doing prior to
our visit and to ignore our presence as well as possible. In
Mozambique each visit was preceded by an accommodation
session a week ahead in order to familiarize infants and their
families with the presence of a foreign person who observes
them with a video camera. In the Netherlands such an
accommodation session was considered unnecessary since
the infants have been exposed to video equipment before
and the researcher was not foreign to them.
The infants were filmed for 45 to 75 minutes to obtain at
least 30 minutes of clear and naturalistic footage for
analysis. Video recording was done using a tripod whenever
possible, placed approximately 5 meters from where most of
the interactions occurred. In smaller confined areas,
recording was done by hand-held camera.

1117

Coding procedures
The videos were coded for 30 minutes during which the
infant was displaying natural behaviour for a prolonged
duration (i.e.: not asleep, off camera and interacting with or
disturbed by the experimenters). Prolonged periods of
breastfeeding (more than 2 minutes) were excluded too,
since this could have introduced a bias toward dyadic
interactions. The videos have been annotated for infant
engagements (Mastin & Vogt, 2016), infant-directed speech
and infants' speech (Vogt et al., 2015), and (co-speech)
gestures directed to and produced by infants (Vogt &
Mastin, 2013). The coding schemes were developed based
on the literature and has been piloted and adapted with
videos from an earlier pilot study from Mozambique. In this
article, we only present the results of infants’ speech and
gestures. Interrater agreements are assessed and reported
based on 35% cross-coding of data, except for the gestures
of which only 15% was cross-coded.
Infant speech All speech produced by the infants during
those 30 minutes was transcribed by research assistants who
were native speakers of the language. The Mozambican data
was subsequently translated to English. For the purpose of
the present study, a distinction was made between
meaningful and meaningless utterances. An utterance was
considered meaningful when the speech was intelligible, or
a clear meaning was conveyed. Only meaningful utterances
were analysed in this study.
To investigate what type of words infants produced, we
coded the semantic category of each utterance. In case the
utterance contained only one word, this is the semantic
category of that word; in case it was a multiword utterance,
we coded the semantic category of the most prominent word
in the utterance. We coded the infants’ speech into the
following three semantic categories (Cohen's kappa=0.90):
Content words. A word was considered to be a content word
if it bears meaning on itself (e.g. ‘daddy’).
Demonstratives/deictics. A word was considered a
demonstrative or deictic if it refers to something else, which
can be another time, space, person or object or if it was
meant to refer someone’s attention to something (e.g.
‘look’). These are words that cannot be understood without
any additional contextual information (e.g. ‘there’).
Other. The category that was coded as ‘other’ consisted of
words that did not belong to the previous categories, such as
affirmatives or interjections (e.g. ‘yes’, ‘so’).
Gestures The gestures produced by the infants were coded
during episodes of joint engagement. A gesture is broadly
defined as any physical activity with the hand or body that
has a clear communicative intent (Zukow-Goldring, 1996).
For this research the coding from Vogt and Mastin (2013)
and Vogt, Masson-Carro and Mastin (2015) was adopted.
The following categories were distinguished (Cohen's
kappa=0.58):

Proximal pointing. The infant points at an object in the near
vicinity using his index finger or hand, in order to draw the
attention of another individual to the target object.
Distal pointing. The infant points at an object placed far
away using his index finger or hand, in order to draw the
attention of another individual to the target object.
Showing. The infant holds an object, drawing another
individual’s attention to it, without any direct imperative.
Reaching. The infant moves his hand towards a target object
with the intention to obtain it, but does not obtain said
object. Also requests for objects by extending the hand were
included in this category.
Offering. The infant offers (or gives) an object to another
individual with the intention of transferring the object.
Taking. The infant takes an object from the other
individual’s possession while it has not been offered by the
other.
Conventional gestures. This category comprises gestures
that are symbolic of nature, such as emblematic gestures,
but also gestures that bear an iconic relationship with their
referent. For example, waving bye-bye, or indicating the
size of the target object with the hands.
Ritualized play. This category accounts for all ritualized
interactions or displays that occur between infants and
communication partners. For instance, dancing, clapping
hands or turn-taking games, such as patty-cake.
Request for attention. This category comprises any gesture
that seeks for the attention of the addressee.
Speech gesture combinations In order to determine
whether the gestural and vocal modalities are unified into
one communication system, gesture and speech
combinations were further coded. Unification is
characterised by both semantic coherence and temporal
synchrony (Butcher & Goldin-Meadow, 2000; GoldinMeadow & Butcher, 2003). In case an utterance was not
accompanied by a gesture, the utterance was coded as
speech only. When an utterance was accompanied by a
gesture, this was coded as a speech+gesture combination. A
combination was categorized as semantically coherent when
it was combining gesture with meaningful and related
speech (Butcher & Goldin-Meadow, 2000). Following
Goldin-Meadow and Butcher (2003), semantic coherence
was further divided into two categories (Cohen's
kappa=0.66):
Semantically congruent. A speech+gesture combination is
semantically congruent when both speech and gesture bear
the same meaning. An example of such a combination is a
child pointing at a dog and uttering the word ‘dog’.
Semantically related. A speech+gesture combination is
semantically related when the meaning of the speech is
different from the meaning of the gesture, but combined
they form a semantically coherent utterance. For instance, a
child shows a pair of glasses while uttering ‘mommy’,
meaning that the pair of glasses is their mother’s.

Infant speech
Table 2 shows the average number of utterances and
speech+gesture combinations expressed by the infants. In
Mozambique the average number of utterances (including
both speech only and speech-gesture combinations) per
child was M=39.64 (SD=27.22), against M=73.36
(SD=41.76) in the Netherlands. A Mann-Whitney U test
showed that this difference tended towards significance
(U=31.00, p=.056). Of the total number of utterances,
30.11% was combined with a gesture in the Netherlands (n
= 22.09 average per child) and 25.23% in Mozambique (n =
10.00 average per child), which resulted in a significantly
larger amount of speech+gesture combinations in the
Netherlands compared to Mozambique (U=26.00, p=.023).
To analyse the semantic categories of speech between
Mozambican and Dutch infants, we compared the mean
percentages of each category. In both communities gestures
were most often accompanied by content words, 52.23% in
Mozambique and 56.40% in the Netherlands. However, in
Mozambique, a gesture was more frequently accompanied
by a demonstrative or deictic (46.04%) than in the
Netherlands (26.49%). This difference is marginally
significant (U=34.00, p=.088). In Mozambique, gestures
were significantly less frequently accompanied by other
words (1.72%) than in the Netherlands (17.11%; U=26.00,
p=.023).
When infants produced speech without a gesture,
Mozambican infants significantly more often produced a
content word (81.77%) compared to the Netherlands
(48.91%; U=18.00, p=.004). For speech only, the
percentages of deictics and demonstratives were similar for
both cultures. However, Dutch infants produced
significantly more other words (37.84%) than in
Mozambique (6.69%; U=4.00, p<.001).

Table 3 shows the mean frequencies with which infants
produced the various gestures in speech+gesture
combinations. The gesture that was used the most in
Mozambique was offering (35.50%), whereas in the
Netherlands this was proximal pointing (45.27%).
Comparison of gesture use in Mozambique with the
Netherlands using the Mann-Whitney U test showed that
gesture use only differed significantly for these two
gestures: proximal pointing (U=2.00, p<.001) and offering
(U=20.00, p=.007). For all the other gestures, no significant
difference across the two cultures was observed.
Table 4 shows to what extent the speech+gesture
combinations were coherent. While the total number of
speech+gesture combinations was higher in the Netherlands,
the mean percentage of coherent combinations in
Mozambique (M=92.86; SD=14.99) was significantly higher
than in the Netherlands (M=80.06; SD=15.23; U=20.00,
p=.007). Interestingly, in Mozambique infants produced
relatively more semantically congruent combinations
(M=39.07; SD=40.84) than in the Netherlands (M=9.70;
SD=9.07), while Dutch infants produced relatively more
semantically related combinations (M=70.36; SD=15.19)
compared to Mozambicans (M=53.79; SD=39.58). A Chi
square showed that there was a significant association
between country and semantic congruency (χ²(1,
353)=14.33, p<.001).

Discussion
The objective of this paper is to explore the cultural
differences in the speech and gestures production of infants
at the age of 17-18 months from the Netherlands and
Mozambique. Since the sample size was small and the
nature of the research exploratory, generalizability is
difficult. Moreover, the two communities do not only differ
in culture but also in socioeconomic status. Many of the
differences that we find may therefore not only be explained
due to cultural differences but also to SES differences.
Many of the differences that we found are in line with those
found in other studies of the same nature (Hart & Risley,
1995; Rowe & Goldin-Meadow, 2009a).
The results revealed that infants from the Netherlands
produced twice as many utterances than infants from
Mozambique (Table 2). This is also the case for
speech+gesture combinations and for speech only
productions, but the latter difference was not significant.
These differences reflect the difference observed in the
amount of IDS, which was also twice as much in the
Netherlands compared to urban Mozambique (Vogt et al.,
2015).
Looking at the type of utterances, infants from both
countries most often produced content words. For utterances
not accompanied by gestures, we found that the percentage
of content words is higher in Mozambique compared to the
Netherlands. This may partly be caused by the low
proportion of other words (like affirmatives or interjections)
observed in Mozambique compared to the proportion of
other words produced in the Netherlands. As a result, the
utterances are redistributed over content words and deictics,
which may cause a skewed distribution.

The higher proportion of content words in the absence of
a gesture may also be related to a relatively frequent use of
gestures when producing a deictic or a demonstrative. When
combining speech with a gesture, Mozambican infants tend
to produce more deictics and demonstratives compared to
Dutch infants, though this difference is only marginally
significant. This tendency may be explained by the high
frequency of the Mozambican deictic ‘im’, which means
‘look at my gesture’. ‘Im’ is a high frequency word in
Changana and Mozambican Portuguese, especially by and
for children, and is practically always accompanied by a
gesture, thus boosting the frequency of deictics and
demonstratives in combination with a gesture.
The relatively low frequency of the other semantic
category in Mozambique may reflect the lack of diversity of
the IDS, because the more diverse the IDS, the more diverse
infants’ vocabularies tend to grow (Hart & Risley, 1995).
Hart and Risley demonstrated that the diversity of IDS
strongly relates to socio-economic status or maternal
education. Since the maternal education in Mozambique is
relatively low, the diversity of IDS may be low, thus
explaining low diversity in the infants' production. Future
analyses on the type-token ratio should inspect whether this
is indeed the case here.
Looking at the different gestures infants produce (Table
4), we see that while Dutch infants produced more than
twice as many gestures, the relative frequencies are highly
similar for both cultures except for the amount of proximal
pointing and the number of offering gestures observed.
Dutch infants produced substantially more proximal
pointing gestures than Mozambican infants. Almost half of
the gestures Dutch children produce are pointing gestures to
an object in close proximity. This is consistent with results
from other cross-cultural studies (Callaghan et al., 2011;
Salomo & Liszkowski, 2013), and may be explained by the
fact that pointing facilitates joint attention and word
learning, which are fostered more in Western middle class
societies than non-Western middle class societies (Keller,
2012).
The higher frequency of the offering (including giving)
gesture in Mozambique might be due to the importance of
sharing in non-Western cultures as part of the social
responsibility (Keller, 2012). Another explanation can be
the high amount of imperatives directed to children in
Mozambique (Vogt et al., 2015), resulting in children
offering their caregivers the things they asked for.
Finally, we observe that in both countries infants’
speech+gesture combinations attained a high level of
semantic coherence, and thus in both cultures children have
a unified communication system in which gesture and
speech are integrated to convey one single message
(Butcher & Goldin-Meadow, 2000). Despite the larger
number of speech+gesture combinations observed in the
Netherlands, Mozambican infants produced proportionally
more semantically coherent combinations. Moreover, these
combinations often convey the same information in
Mozambique and are thus semantically congruent, whereas

1120

in the Netherlands the combinations often convey different
information, and are thus semantically related. Given the
suggested associations between semantic congruency and
temporal synchrony, and between semantic relatedness and
the onset of two-word utterances (Goldin-Meadow &
Butcher, 2003), these findings could predict related cultural
differences in the development of temporal synchrony and
two-word utterances.
