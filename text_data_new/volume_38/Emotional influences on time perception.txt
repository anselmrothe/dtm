Abstract
In studies on prospective time perception, a prolonging effect
of arousal on time estimates is commonly reported for
durations under 2s while the effect vanishes for longer
intervals. In this study, we investigated how arousal and
pleasure induced by aural stimuli varying in volume and
valence influenced reproductions in the range from 1.1s to 5s.
As expected, higher arousal was associated with higher
estimates for 1.1s durations. However, this effect was also
found for 3.8s durations. An additional analysis with linear
mixed models revealed an interaction between volume
manipulation and subjective ratings regarding arousal and
pleasure. Based on these results we propose that subjective
experience of the emotional quality of stimuli might be
interesting for further research on prospective time
perception. Moreover, the results showed that not only within
subject variation should be statistically controlled when
analyzing such data. Instead, statistical models should also
include parameters controlling for stimulus material.

Introduction
The prolonging effect of emotions on prospective temporal
duration judgments has been subject to a great number of
research projects and publications in the last decade.
Research on this phenomenon differs regarding
methodology and the considered duration. Examples for the
variety of methods to induce an emotional state are
emotional pictures (Gil & Droit-Volet, 2012), music (DroitVolet, Ramos, Bueno & Bigand, 2013), emotional faces (Gil
& Droit-Volet, 2011), emotional sounds (Mella, Conty &
Pouthas, 2011) and bodily expressions (Droit-Volet & Gil,
2015). Another variation in methodology relates to differing
timing tasks, such as the bisection task (Droit-Volet, Brunot
& Niedenthal, 2004), verbal estimates (Gil & Droit-Volet,
2012), and production (Gil & Droit-Volet, 2011) as well as
reproduction tasks (Angrilli, Cherubini, Pavese &
Manfredini, 1997). With respect to duration ranges, most of
these studies focused on intervals between 400ms and
1600ms, while only a few experiments investigated longer
durations up to 6000ms.
Gil and Droit-Volet (2012) asked participants to verbally
estimate for how long different emotional pictures had been
presented. The durations ranged between 50ms and 1600ms.
The presented pictures systematically varied with respect to
the arousal level they caused (high vs. low) as well as with

respect to the discrete emotion they evoked (disgust, fear,
sadness, or none for neutral pictures). Results showed
higher estimates for emotional pictures compared to neutral
ones and indicated that this effect gained in magnitude with
increasing arousal (Gil & Droit-Volet, 2012). The same
effect was found in all other studies reported above for
durations smaller than two seconds.
These results accord with the clock speed hypothesis (c.f.
attentional-gate-model, Block & Zakay, 1996) which
assumes that prospective timing relies on accumulated
pulses generated by an internal clock. The clock accelerates
when arousal increases. This leads to a higher count of
pulses compared to unchanged or decreased arousal. More
pulses cause a prolonged time perception and consequently
lead to higher estimates. Thus, the finding that a raising of
arousal leads to longer estimates can be explained by an
increased number of pulses due to an accelerated clock.
However, this effect seems to change for longer intervals.
Noulhiane, Mella, Samson, Ragot and Pouthas (2007)
studied the impact of different arousal levels (low vs. high)
on time estimates for 2s-durations and found that stimuli
evoking high arousal led to shorter estimates than those
evoking low arousal. This finding was consistent over
emotionally negative and positive stimuli and was found for
verbal timing tasks as well as for reproductions. It clearly
contradicts the clock speed hypothesis and deviates from all
other studies reported above.
Noulhiane et al.’s surprising result (2007) raises the
question why the arousal effect turns into the opposite
direction. One explanation could be that subjects start to
cognitively process emotions when confronted with an
emotion induction long enough, as for two seconds
(Noulhiane et al., 2007). Such a processing would bind
attentional resources by reducing the attention on the timing
task. Less attention on the timing task means that more
pulses of the clock are missed, leading to a lower count of
pulses and a shorter estimate. This explanation is in line
with literature on the shortening effect of distraction on
prospective timing (Brown, 2008). Another explanation
could be that the reversed effect is modality specific.
Noulhiane et al. (2007) used aural stimuli in their
experiment. Angrilli et al. (1997) induced emotions via
visual stimuli and report results consistent with the clock
speed hypothesis. More precisely, they report longer
estimates for high arousing stimuli than for low arousing
stimuli at two seconds durations.

To sum up, evidence for the prolonging effect of arousal
on time estimates of durations smaller than two seconds is
very strong and supports the clock speed hypothesis.
Looking at durations lasting for two seconds, however, the
influence of arousal is unclear. Starting from this summary,
it is obvious that the arousal effect on time perception
during intervals greater than or equal to two seconds
requires further inspection. Both, Angrilli et al. (1997) as
well as Noulhiane et al. (2007), reported no such an effect
for four seconds and six seconds durations. In their
experiments, time estimates did not significantly differ
between arousal levels for these intervals. Nather, Bueno,
Bigand and Droit-Volet (2011) induced arousal via pictures
of body postures. Even though they found the prolonging
arousal effect at durations ranging from 400ms to 1600ms,
they did not detect such an effect at durations ranging from
two to eight seconds. These studies give support to the
assumption that the lengthening effect of arousal vanishes at
durations longer than two seconds.
Up to this point, only the effect of arousal on time
estimates has been discussed. Another important dimension
of emotions is valence and many of the studies described
above did not only vary arousal but valence as well.
Noulhiane et al. (2007), for example, compared lowarousing emotional with low-arousing neutral sounds and
reported longer estimates for emotional compared to neutral
stimuli for the 2s-duration. Likewise, Gil and Droit-Volet
(2012) compared emotional stimuli to neutral ones and
found the same pattern. Similar results were reported by
Droit-Volet et al. (2004) as well as by Gil and Droit-Volet
(2011).
Summing up the results, it is obvious that a
comprehensive investigation of emotional influences on
time perception ought to address both, arousal as well as
valence for a larger area of durations. This leads to the
following research question: How do arousal and valence
affect time perception of durations ranging from under to
over two seconds? To answer this question, we conducted
an experiment in which valence and arousal were varied for
durations between 1.1s and 5.0s. This range includes
durations for which an arousal effect is commonly found,
for which results are ambiguous and for which the arousal
effect is expected to vanish. With respect to stimuli, we
decided to focus on the same modality as Noulhiane et al.
(2007). The use of aural stimuli allows a comparison with
their rather uncommon findings and might help to decide
between the two explanations discussed earlier.

similar to each other on the predefined dimension, slight
differences can cause systematic variation in the data. If
systematic by-item variation is not statistically accounted
for, error variance increases and thus makes type II errors
more likely.
Linear mixed models (LMM) offer a solution to this
problem. They are called ‘mixed models’ because they can
include fixed effects, like factors or covariates, as well as
random effects for subjects and items (Winter, 2013).
Random effects account for variance between subjects and
between items in three ways: by including random
intercepts for both subjects and items, by including random
slopes considering variance between subjects respectively
items for all main effects and interactions and by
considering correlations between intercepts and slopes
(Bates, Kliegl, Vasishth & Baayen, 2015). All this can be
done in one statistical model which gives an advantage over
a single within ANOVA because the ANOVA only allows
to consider either variance of subjects or of items. Thus,
LMMs can help to reduce error variance (Winter, 2013) and
therefore increase statistical power (Kliegl, Wei,
Dambacher, Yan & Zhou, 2011). Moreover, LMMs make it
possible to analyze the complete data set, instead of
averaging over certain dimensions. This helps to improve
the understanding of complex structures within the data as
for example by identifying important covariates (Kliegl et
al., 2011). Furthermore, they allow the inclusion of
covariates or predictors that vary within subjects thus
offering another advantage over an ANOVA.
This advantage is especially important when looking at
time perception because its analysis may be strongly
influenced by inter-individual differences. For example,
time perception changes with age (Block, Zakay &
Hancock, 1999) and studies suggest that it differs between
gender (Block, Hancock & Zakay, 2000). Therefore,
including statistical parameters for variation between
participants may improve the understanding of important
participant characteristics (Kliegl et al., 2011) and help to
detect effects that were otherwise overlooked.

Method
Participants
A study was conducted with N=20 participants (11 male, 9
female). All participants were young adults (Mage= 25.1,
SDage=3.3) comparable to the studies cited above.

Design, material and procedure

Methodological notion on Linear Mixed Models
Another reason for the ambiguous state of affairs
concerning the relationship between emotions and time
perception may be methodological in nature. In this field of
research, mostly ANOVAs are used to analyze data. To this
account, most studies cited above used stimuli that were
rated for arousal and valence beforehand and averaged the
dependent variable over trials for certain groups of stimuli.
However, even though all stimuli from one group are

The study was based on a 2x3x4 within-subjects design
consisting of the factors valence (negative, neutral), volume
(low, medium, loud) and duration (1.1s, 2.4s, 3.8s, 5.0s). To
implement the factor valence, twelve stimuli were taken
from the International Affective Digital Sounds System
(Lang, Bradley & Cuthbert, 2008). Six of them were
categorized as neutral and six as emotionally negative
according to the norm by Lang et al. (2008). All sounds
showed a continuous pattern of noise. For the factor volume,

2658

the levels were low, medium and loud. The difference
between these levels was established by amplifying the
original sound from the IADS by the factors 0.04, 0.4 and 4
respectively. The mean volumes were the following:
Mlow=41dBA
(SD=2.9),
Mmedium=61dBA
(SD=2.5),
Mloud=70dBA (SD=2.3). Arousal induction via volume was
chosen because noise is known to stimulate the central
nervous system and to increase arousal level (Hockey,
1972). Moreover, this variation allows the use of the same
sounds to elicit different levels of arousal. Under each
combination of valence, volume and duration, six sounds
were presented, resulting in 144 stimuli. In addition to these,
36 trials with random durations between 0.9s and 5.3s were
introduced to increase the variability of the durations.
Altogether, this adds up to a total of 180 trials.
The experiment consisted of two successive phases, a
rating and a test phase. In the rating phase, participants
heard each stimulus for 6s and filled in the self-assessment
manikin SAM (Bradley & Lang, 1994) to judge its
emotional effect in terms of pleasure and arousal. At the
beginning of the test phase, the forthcoming trials and the
reproduction procedure were explained. Participants were
instructed not to count while perceiving or reproducing the
durations. After the instruction, they completed three
practice trials with a neutral sound that was not used
otherwise in the experiment. Each trial was started by the
participants themselves by pressing the space key. After a 2s
delay, the aural stimulus was presented, followed by a
request to reproduce the duration. The reproduction was
accomplished by a continuous key press without any sound.
This response type was chosen because continuous key
presses show less variability than responses that indicate
only the end or both start and end of an interval (Mioni,
Stablum, McClintock, & Grondin, 2014). After each trial,
participants were asked to report whether they had counted
(by pressing key 1) or not (key 3). They started the next trial
by pressing space.
The presentation of stimuli and instructions as well as the
recording of data was implemented in Matlab 2014b and the
Psychophysics Toolbox extensions version 3 (Brainard,
1997; Pelli, 1997). All visual information (e.g. instructions,
requests) were given on a 22-inch desktop display. Sounds
were presented over headphones, while a fixations cross was
shown on the display. Pupil dilation was measured but its
data is not reported in this paper due to limited space.

Data analysis
Prior to the analysis, all trials with random duration as well
as all trials in which participants had counted were
eliminated from the data set. For the remaining 2839 trials,
perceived time ratios (PRTs) were computed by dividing the
duration of the reproduction by the duration of the presented
interval (Block, Hancock & Zakay, 2010). PTRs were
preferred over the original data of the reproductions because
they represent a measure for goodness of estimation. A PTR
of one represents a perfect estimation independently from
the presented duration, while a PTR smaller respectively

bigger than one indicates underestimation respectively
overestimation. PTRs allow for comparing duration
estimates regarding the strength of their over- or
underestimation which can vary between different arousal
levels or even different durations.
The data was analyzed with a repeated measurements
ANOVA and with a Linear Mixed Model (LMM). We
choose to use both methods to find out if the LMM provides
more insights than the ANOVA. Data analysis was
conducted with R (R Core Team, 2015) using the ez
(Lawrence, 2013), lme4 (Bates, Maechler, Bolker &
Walker, 2015) and ggplot (Wickham, 2009) packages. In
accordance with common practice for ANOVAs, all data
was averaged over sounds with negative valence and over
sounds with neutral valence for each duration and volume
level resulting in 24 values per subject. Additionally, a
manipulation check for the segmentation of the 12 sounds
into neutral and negative valence groups was conducted. To
this account, t-tests were conducted with the subjective
ratings from the rating phase regarding pleasure and arousal
averaged over the neutral and over the negative sounds. As
expected, the negative group of sounds was rated as
inducing less pleasure than the neutral sounds, t(19)=-10.8,
p<.001, r=.93. Regarding arousal, the negative group of
sounds was rated as inducing more arousal than the neutral
sounds, t(19)=4.7, p<.001, r=.73. Hence, both pleasure and
arousal were different for the two valence conditions.
Moreover, mean correlation coefficients computed via z
transformation showed high correlations between arousal
and valence for negative sounds, r= -.67, and medium
correlation for neutral sounds, r= -.35.

Results
Using the averaged data, an ANOVA Type III was
conducted with the factors duration, volume and valence
(4x3x2). The ANOVA revealed significant main effects for
volume, F(1, 38)=20.8, p<.001, ges=.025, duration, F(1.16,
21.99)=54.2, p<.001, ges=.286, and valence, F(1, 19)=15.3,
p<.001, ges=.008.
Regarding the main effect of volume, low volume sounds
had lower PTRs (Mlow=0.83) compared to sounds with
medium volume (Mmedium=0.88), t1(19)=-4.1, p<.01, r=.68.
Moreover, PTRs of the latter were lower compared to those
of loud sounds (Mloud=0.90), t(19)=-2.2, p<.05, r=.44. A
closer inspection of the main effect of duration revealed that
sounds played for 1.1s showed higher PTRs values
(M1.1s=1.04) compared to sounds played for 2.4s
(M2.4s=0.92), t(19)=5.3, p<.001, r=.77. Moreover, PTRs of
the latter were higher than PTRs of sounds that lasted 3.8s
(M3.8s=0.80), t(19)=7.5, p<.001, r=.83. PTRs for the
duration of 3.8s compared to those with a duration of 5.0s
were also significantly higher (M5.0s=0.73), t(19)=7.3,
p<.001, r=.86. As the PTRs show, all durations were
underestimated. Increasing duration led to stronger

underestimations, while increasing volume led to weaker
underestimations. Negative sounds (Mnegative=0.89) led to
weaker underestimations compared to neutral sounds
(Mneutral=0.86).
The ANOVA also showed a significant interaction
between volume and interval, F(2.64, 50.21)=4.9, p<.01,
ges=.012, which is visualized in Figure 1. Post-hoc t-test
revealed significant differences between low and medium
sounds for 3.8s, t(19)=-4.0, p<.01, r=.68 but not for other
durations, ts(19)>-2.4, n.s.. Furthermore, they showed
significant differences between low and loud sounds at 1.1s,
t(19)=-5.9, p<.001, r=.80 and at 3.8s, t(19)=-5.0, p<.001,
r=.75. For none of the durations, a significant difference
between medium and loud sounds was found, ts(19)>-2.6,
n.s.. No other interaction effect of the ANOVA proved to be
significant, Fs<1, ps>.05.

Furthermore, the effect of duration and volume changed in
magnitude between the different sounds.

Regarding fixed effects, a stepwise backwards selection
was conducted. During each step, a new model was fitted, in
which one of the model terms was eliminated. Each new
model was tested against the former model by a likelihood
ratio test with an alpha criterion of .05. The remaining fixed
effects and their output statistics are listed in Table 1. Pvalues were calculated using the lmerTest package
(Kuznetsova, Brockhoff & Christensen, 2015).

In addition to the ANOVA, a LMM with the fixed effects
duration and volume (4x3, centered variables) was fitted by
restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The factor valence
was replaced by two continuous predictors. These were the
subjective ratings on arousal and pleasure for each sound
given by each participant during the rating phase. All
possible interaction terms between the four fixed effects
were included. As random effect, both random intercepts for
subjects and sounds as well as all random slopes for the two
factors over subjects and sounds were comprised. The
analysis started with the following model:
(1) PTR ~ (Duration+Volume+Pleasure+Arousal)^4 +
(1+Duration+Volume+Duration:Volume|Subjects)
+ (1+Duration+Volume+Duration:Volume|Sounds)
To avoid over-parameterization unnecessary random
effects were eliminated following the procedure suggested
by Bates et al. (2015). Random effects in the final model are
presented in formula (2). Random effects by subjects
revealed that subjects not only differed regarding intercepts,
but also with respect to the effect that duration had on PTR
values. In other words, the strength of the duration effect
differed between subjects. The random intercept of sound
showed that the intercept changed between the 12 sounds.

Compared to the ANOVA the LMM showed the
previously described effects of duration and of the volumeduration interaction. However, the LMM indicated that the
effect of the arousal induction via volume on PTRs was
dependent on the emotional qualities of the stimuli, namely
arousal and pleasure. Moreover, the duration x pleasure
interaction indicated that PTRs were higher for low pleasure
stimuli compared to high pleasure stimuli, while this effect
was stronger for longer intervals.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the effect of arousal and
valence on time perception regarding durations ranging
from 1.1s to 5.0s. For this purpose, 12 sounds classified as
either unpleasant or neutral were played at different volume
levels and participants reproduced the duration of the
presented sound. Data analysis was carried out on
standardized estimates (PTRs) using both an ANOVA and a
linear mixed model (LMM). Results revealed that
underestimations grew stronger with increasing durations.
While the ANOVA showed both an effect of volume as well
as of valence, the LMM indicated that the relation between
emotions and duration estimations are more complicated
than a simple main effect of arousal or of valence.
The effect of volume as shown in the ANOVA and the
interaction between volume and duration in both analyses

2660

can be regarded as further support for the prolonging effect
of arousal on time perception. Here, estimates increased
with the volume of the presented sound. Literature on noise
and its effect on arousal level indicates that high volume
noise increases arousal (e.g. Hockey, 1972). These findings
support our interpretation that the louder sounds elicited
higher arousal which in turn caused an increase of time
estimates. This arousal effect lends further support to the
clock speed hypothesis as predicted by the attentional-gatemodel (Block & Zakay, 1996).
However, the prolonging effect of volume differed within
the duration range. At 1.1s low and loud volumes lead to
significantly distinct estimates. This is not surprising
because it is in line with the commonly found arousal effect
for durations smaller than two seconds. In contrast to other
studies (Angrilli et al., 1997; Noulhiane et al., 2007; Nather
et al., 2011), however, the effect did not vanish for duration
longer than two seconds. Even though the found prolonging
effect did not prove as significant for 2.4s durations, a
significant difference in estimates was found at 3.8s
concerning the low and medium as well as the the low and
loud volume. Before declaring this finding as further
support for the clock speed hypothesis though, one point has
to be made. The clock speed hypothesis not only predicts
higher estimates when arousal is increased, it also predicts
that this effect should gain in magnitude when durations
grow longer. This prediction is based on the mode of action
belonging to the clock. If durations are longer, the clock has
more time to produce pulses. Hence, increased clock speed
will not lead to an additive increase of pulses but to a
multiplicative increase (Gil & Droit-Volet, 2012; Nather et
al., 2011). However, when comparing effect sizes of the
difference between low and loud sounds between 1.1s and
3.8s durations, the results of this study provide no evidence
for an increased arousal effect. Thus, even though the
arousal effect did not vanish as described by other authors, it
does not show a multiplicative increase either.
Comparing our results to those by Noulhiane et al. (2007),
we could not replicate the reversal of the arousal effect for
two second durations. Moreover, our results do not support
the assumption of a modality specific effect because they
are consistent with results gained by applying visual instead
of aural stimuli (Angrilli et al., 1997). Instead, the arousal
effect reported in this study as well as the vanishing arousal
effect described by other authors for durations longer than
two seconds, might be connected to a change in cognitive
processing for durations exceeding two seconds. More
precisely, attentional processes might come into play for
durations greater than 2 seconds. Thus, the interplay of
arousal and attention as described in the attentional-gatemodel (Block & Zakay, 1996) might become particularly
important for longer intervals.
Regarding the effect of valence shown in the ANOVA,
estimates for negative stimuli were higher than those for
neutral stimuli. Even though it was only a small effect, it is
in line with earlier findings (Droit-Volet et al., 2004; Gil &
Droit-Volet, 2011; Gil & Droit-Volet, 2012; Noulhiane et

al., 2007). Nonetheless, as shown in the manipulation check
for the segmentation of stimuli into negative and neutral,
both groups did not only differ regarding pleasure but also
regarding arousal. Thus, the difference in PTRs between
groups cannot be distinctly associated with either either
dimension. In the analysis using LMM, the factor valence
was therefore replaced by arousal and pleasure ratings given
by each subject for each sound. The analysis revealed that
PTRs were affected by an interaction of the subjective
ratings. Furthermore, the interaction effect was dependent
on volume, and thus on the level of arousal induction. This
three-way interaction cannot be easily interpreted for two
reason: First, the two rating dimensions covary and second,
both ratings were measured on a nine-point scale making
post-hoc comparisons of means or slopes unusable.
However, we derive two hypotheses from the three-way
interaction that should be tested further in future studies.
First, people differ in their subjective experience of the
emotional quality of stimuli and their experience has a
distinct impact on time perception. Whether this experience
can be measured by ratings as done here, or if other
measures (e.g. physiological data) are needed, remains open.
Second, there is a close connection between arousal and
pleasure and their impact on time perception. Previous
studies have already looked beyond the scope of the clock
speed hypothesis by including valence as an impact factor
on time perception. However, we want to emphasize the
importance to look at the effect of subjectively experienced
emotional reactions to the stimuli rather than at the effect of
predefined categories of arousal levels and valence. Such an
approach seems more appropriate for the interplay of
arousal and valence. An alternative operationalization might
be a measure for emotional intensity, a concept that has
been discussed by Reisenzein (1994) and Scherer (2005).
Summing up, the reported results of the ANOVA are in
line with a prolonging arousal effect on time. Moreover, the
arousal induction method by volume changes seems to be
comparable to other induction methods. However, the
arousal effect did not vanish for durations longer than 2s,
but it did not gain in magnitude as predicted by the clock
speed hypothesis either. Thus, in line with other studies (e.g.
Noulhiane et al., 2007), our results suggest a change in
cognitive processing for durations exceeding two seconds.
When including subjective predictors with help of a LMM it
becomes clear that the effect of arousal and the effect of
valence on time perception are interconnected. Focusing
research on the effect of their interplay might enhance the
understanding of the cognitive processes involved in time
perception. However, such research should include also
positive stimuli and not only neutral and negative ones as
done here. Reflecting the data analysis strategy, LMMs are a
handy tool to include continuous predictors with withinsubject variation in the statistical model. Moreover, the
random effect structure of the LMM showed that it is
reasonable to not only consider by-subject variations as it is
done in the ANOVA, but also to consider by-item
variations.
