Abstract
In this study, we manipulated gain/loss framing context during
a simulated negotiation between a human user and a virtual
agent. Task instructions placed users either in a loss or gain
framed context, such that those in the loss frame had to
minimize expenses whereas those in the gain frame had to
maximize profits. The virtual agent displayed facial emotions
so that we could also test how interpersonal emotions interact
with framing. Results suggest that individuals are more
motivated to minimize their losses than maximizing their gains.
The loss frame caused individuals to demand more during the
negotiation, hence to minimize expenses. Neurophysiological
results suggest that cardiovascular patterns of challenge (i.e.,
positive motivations) were present in the loss frame condition,
most strongly when the virtual human smiled. We discuss these
results in regards to Prospect Theory. This work also has
implications for designing and rigorously evaluating humanlike virtual agents.

Introduction
Facing a situation with almost certain loss looming,
individuals are generally more likely to engage cognitive
processes to take risks. Conversely, facing almost certain
gain, individuals are more likely to be risk averse. A concrete
example of this is to consider a situation in which two
individuals are presented with $100. One of them, Bob, is
given the option of either (A) definitely keeping $40 or (B)
taking a gamble with a 75% probability of winning the entire
$100 (and 25% probability of losing everything). The other
individual, John, is given the option of either (A) definitely
losing $60 or (B) taking a gamble with a 75% probability of
winning the entire $100. On average, research in
experimental economics, game theory, and psychology has
shown that individuals in Bob’s decision frame would more
likely be risk averse and choose (A), whereas individuals in
John’s situation would more likely be risk seeking and choose
(B).
The goal of this work is to understand the behavioral and
neurophysiological impacts of framing in an interpersonal
decision making task, such as negotiation. Framing

phenomena have been well studied, and have led to Prospect
Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), which suggests that
that people are more motivated to take greater risks in order
to avoid losses, because “Losses loom larger than gains
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, p. 279).” Related research has
focused on the effects of framing on negotiation behavior.
For example, how a negotiation is framed can affect how an
individual approaches, views and responds to the negotiation
partner. For example, Bazerman, Magliozzi and Neale (1985)
manipulated framing in a free-market negotiation context,
where participants could engage in multiple negotiation
transactions, by instructing half of the participants to
maximize their profits (gain frame) and the other half to
minimize expenses (loss frame). Their results indicated that
individuals in the gain frame completed more negotiations
compared to those in the loss frame, suggesting that the
framing context affected negotiation outcomes.
Another relevant cue in negotiation is the emotional state
of the negotiator. Carnevale (2008) investigated the
relationship of both negotiation frame outcome and felt
affect. He manipulated affect using a mood induction
paradigm that involved giving participants a small, clear
plastic bag full of chocolates. Results from Carnevale’s
(2008) study suggested that participants demanded more in
the loss frame than in the gain frame when they were not
given candy. Conversely, in the positive affect condition, the
opposite occurred such that individuals in the gain frame
demanded more in the negotiation.
Carnevale’s work suggested that positive affect led to a
reference point shift to the right of the origin in the classic
Prospect Theory value function, and this induced a
downsizing of loss differences and an upsizing of gain
differences. This explains why individuals in a gain frame
demanded more relative to those in the loss frame. Inducing
positive affect caused individuals to behave in the opposite
direction in the loss frame; they demanded less in the
negotiation task than those in the control condition, who did
not experience the mood induction paradigm.
In addition to felt affect playing a role in negotiation,
emotional displays by a negotiation partner can conceivably
affect the goals and related emotions of a negotiator. It is

2369

expected that two parties will display emotions when
negotiating over a set of issues, whether their goal is to obtain
the best outcome for themselves or arrive at an integrative
solution that maximizes the joint gain. Effective negotiation
involves not only expressing appropriate emotional
responses, but also understanding the effects of others’
emotions on the self (de Melo, Carnevale, Read, & Gratch,
2014; Khooshabeh et al., 2013). Emotional appraisals can be
inferred from behavior during a task or by asking participants
using subjective questionnaire survey instruments. It is also
plausible to index the effect of social cues, such as emotions,
on negotiators at an implicit level by using advanced
neurophysiological measures.

Inferring Psychological States from More than Just
Behavioral Performance Measures
Many researchers have demonstrated the role of emotions as
social information in motivated performance tasks such as
negotiations (Choi, de Melo, Khooshabeh, Woo, & Gratch,
2015; van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004). In addition to
behavioral performance during a negotiation task, other
measures can index the social effects of emotion, such as
psychologically driven neurophysiological states. The biopsychosocial (BPS) model (Blascovich & Mendes, 2010) is a
theoretical account of how a complex, multivariate pattern of
cardiovascular responses indicates states of task engagement
as well as motivational polarity; i.e., “challenge” and
“threat.” A challenge state indexes when an individual
appraises her resources as exceeding demands in a situation,
thereby having positive motivation and higher coping
potential, whereas threat indicates when an individual
appraises demands in a situation as exceeding resources.
Briefly, the BPS model is based on the neuroendocrine
underpinnings (i.e., Dienstbier, 1989) of cardiovascular
responses involving the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary
(SAM) and hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal-cortical (HPA)
axes. Both challenge and threat states involve the activation
of the SAM axis, while only the threat state involves both
axes. Accordingly, activation of common SAM axis neural
and adrenal medullary endocrine processes affect
cardiovascular responses underlying both challenge and
threat, including increased heart rate (HR) and increased
ventricular contractility (VC; i.e., decreased pre-ejection
period or “PEP”), both of which index task engagement.
Cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR)
patterns differ depending on motivational state. A challenge
state results in decreased TPR and an increase in CO, whereas
a threat state leads to little or no change or a decrease in CO
and little or no change or an increase in TPR (Blascovich &
Mendes, 2010).
Psychologically, challenge motivation occurs when an
individual’s consciously and/or unconsciously evaluated
resources outweigh consciously and/or unconsciously
evaluated task demands. Threat occurs when resources are
evaluated as not meeting task demands. For example,

situations that involve uncertainty, which can result from
unexpected social cues, have been found to implicitly
increase demand evaluations relative to resources (Mendes,
Blascovich, Hunter, Lickel, & Jost, 2007). The BPS model of
challenge and threat gives insights into appraisals of resource
and demand ratios through the lens of a complex set of
cardiovascular responses.
The BPS model also gauges the effect of outcome framing
when there is no other social counterpart in a decision making
context. In a study by Seery, Weisbuch and Blascovich
(2009), participants were given a cognitive test. Half the
participants were told that they could make as much as five
dollars and would receive a monetary reward of $0.50 for
each item they answered correctly. The other half of the
participants was told that they would begin the task with five
dollars and would incur a penalty of $0.50 for each item they
did not answer correctly. Expected values in both conditions
were the same; however one outcome was framed as a gain
and the other as a loss. Their results indicated that participants
in the gain frame experienced challenge (decreased TPR),
while those in the loss frame experienced threat (increased
TPR). This suggests that the BPS model has been validated
to detect psychological states that correspond to decision
frames. However, it remains to be seen whether
psychophysiological states in this unitary cognitive task
generalize to dyadic decision making tasks such as
negotiation.

Hypotheses
Loss framing will lead to greater demand Based on
Prospect Theory, we predicted that individuals in the loss
frame condition would be motivated to minimize their
expenses compared to those in the gain frame because losses
loom larger. Accordingly, those in the loss frame are
predicted to make fewer concessions (i.e., greater demands).
Affective Facial Expressions If positive facial expressions
from a negotiation opponent have the same effect on
observers as a positive mood-induction, then individuals in
the happy/gain condition should make more demands in the
negotiation based on Carnevale (2008). As Carnevale (2008)
noted, “An interesting follow-up experiment may be to
examine reference dependence in expected negotiation
outcomes driven by perceived negative and positive affect of
the adversary. (p. 60)”. The connection between moodinduction using chocolate versus a positive facial expression
is potentially tenuous, but this warrants an empirical study of
whether positive facial expressions simply induce positive
moods. For this study, affect was manipulated via the virtual
agent who displayed either angry, happy, or neutral facial
expressions (control), which were previously validated
(Khooshabeh et al., 2013). We included an angry expressive

2370

virtual agent as an exploratory investigation on the effects of
negatively valenced interpersonal affect.
Framing and Motivational State According to Seery et al.
(2009), framing outcomes in terms of a potential for loss led
to lower CO and greater TPR (consistent with relative threat,
which is more negatively valenced than challenge). But it is
possible that the mechanism by which gain/loss framing
worked in the context of their singular, cognitive motivated
performance task would be different in situations that involve
dyadic negotiation as a function of affect information
transmitted by one partner or the other. In particular, given
that losses loom larger, individuals should be more positively
motivated (i.e., challenged) to overcome expenses (as in the
loss frame) than maximize profits (as in the gain frame).
Moreover, the frame effect can be interpreted in terms of risk
in the negotiation. Negotiators are generally risk tolerant in a
loss frame (Carnevale, 2008), thereby making greater
demands (i.e., fewer concessions) and risking nonagreement; the opposite takes place in a gain frame, such that
negotiators are risk averse, hence making more concessions
to reach agreement. Based on this risk framing hypothesis, we
predict that loss framing should cause relative challenge
compared to gain framing. Similarly, gain framing should
cause greater relative threat compared to loss framing.

Methods
Participants
Participants were 162 undergraduate students (90 males, 72
females) at the local university, ranging in age from 18 to 24
(M = 19.2, SD = 1.22) and were granted course credit for their
participation.

Design
Participants were instructed to maximize points or
minimize loss. Specifically, their role was to sell home
appliances by negotiating multiple issues, which included
delivery time, discount terms, and financing terms. The
participants used the mouse to make offers to the interactive
virtual agent (buyer) which displayed either an angry, neutral
or happy facial expression after participants made an offer on
rounds 1, 3 and 5. The virtual buyer conceded two levels on
one of the issues per round, which is deemed to be moderate
in prior research (van Kleef et al., 2004); the task lasted six
rounds where the participants would make counter-offers to
the virtual agent’s initial and ensuing offer. Participants could
reach an agreement with the virtual agent by either accepting
the virtual agent’s offer or lowering their offer to match a
previous offer from the virtual agent.
In order to analyze the full effect of the virtual human’s
facial expressions across the whole task, an exclusion
criterion was applied to remove participants who agreed to
the virtual agent’s offer before the sixth round. The reason for
doing that was because those participants would not have

experienced the entirety of the virtual agent’s emotional
facial displays. The study used a 2 (gain frame/loss frame) x
3 (angry/happy/neutral) factorial between-subjects design.
Participants were randomly assigned to conditions via
computer program based on the “round robin” technique.
Frame Participants were randomly assigned to complete the
task with instructions that effectively put them in a loss or
gain frame context. They were informed that 8000 points
represented the highest profit they could obtain. In the gain
frame, they were informed that the worst negotiation outcome
was zero points on each of three issues and the best outcome
was the maximum 8000 points. They were instructed to
maximize profits. In contrast, loss frame participants were
told to minimize their expenses. They were told that -8000
represented the highest expenses, and hence, the worst
negotiation outcome. An expense of zero points on each issue
represented the best negotiation outcome in the loss frame
condition (see Table 1).
An example will help illustrate how the same negotiation
outcomes would result in a mathematically equivalent
number of points in each frame. For example, a participant
might arrive at a negotiation outcome of level 3 for the issue
of delivery time, 5 for discount terms, and 4 for finance terms.
In the loss frame, this corresponds to expenses of -4900 (1200 – 1200 – 2500 = -4900). The -4900 expense would cut
into a total possible profit of 8000, so the resulting profit
would be 3100 points (8000 – 4900 = 3100). The same level
3-5-4 for the three issues would result in 3100 points in the
gain frame (400 + 1200 + 1500 = 3100).
Participants and the virtual agent could vary each of their
offers on each of the three issues from levels of 1 to 9, with
9-9-9 representing the optimal profit (see Table 1); the
negotiation behavior of the virtual agent was fixed such that
the initial offer was 1-2-1 and he conceded two levels for one
of the issues on each round (see Khooshabeh et al, 2013). The
negotiation task interface reflected in real time the number of
points the participant earned or lost after each offer that the
virtual agent made and with each counter-offer the participant
provided.

Physiological responses Participants’ cardiovascular
responses were measured during the task using a BIOPAC
MP150 system and related amplifiers (Goleta, CA).
Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals were recorded using an
electrocardiograph amplifier (Model ECG100C). Blood
pressure was recorded via the continuous non-invasive
arterial pressure (CNAP) monitor (Model NIPB100F).
Impedance cardiography was collected using a tetra-polar
aluminum/mylar tape electrode system (Model NICO100C)
secured around the participant’s neck and torso and an
impedance cardiograph.

Procedure
Participants were brought to the lab. Prior to beginning the
experiment they completed an informed consent form. A
female research assistant then placed impedance tape and the
other electrodes on the participant's neck and torso followed
by a blood pressure cuff on the brachial artery of the
participant’s upper arm (for calibration purposes only) and an
additional cuff on the radial artery of the participant’s index
finger. After recording a five-minute resting baseline of
physiological data, the participant was instructed to begin the
negotiation task on a computer provided by the lab.
The participants first read instructions that described the
scenario and task at hand and then were asked four follow-up
questions to ascertain that they understood the instructions.
As an added incentive to motivate successful performance
during the task, participants were told that they had a chance
of winning the distinction of “top negotiator” by both (1)
reaching an agreement with the virtual agent negotiation
partner and (2) earning the highest profit. They first engaged
in a practice round to familiarize themselves with the
negotiation task interface before beginning the negotiation
task. Unbeknownst to participants beforehand, the task ran
for 6 rounds and the virtual agent’s offers were preset. Upon
completion of the negotiation task, participants were asked to
complete survey questionnaires and then were debriefed and
thanked for their participation.

frame, F (1, 156) = 10.9, p = .001, p2 = .07. Participants in
the loss condition demanded more on average (M = 5872, SE
= 249) compared to those in the gain condition (M = 4695,
SE = 256). This supports the risk framing hypothesis that
predicted loss framing would motivate participants to
demand more in the negotiation. There was no significant
interaction of the emotion and frame variables, F (2, 156) =
1.52, p = .22, p2 = .019.
Another measure of negotiation performance was the
amount by which the initial offer differed from the final offer
in the negotiation. This demand difference (concession) score
was computed by subtracting the number of points demanded
in the last round from those demanded in the first round. The
ANOVA on the demand difference score indicated that there
was no significant effect of emotion (F < 1) and no effect of
framing (F < 1), but there was a marginally significant
interaction of emotion and framing, F (2, 156) = 2.85, p =
.061. An exclusion criterion was applied to remove
participants who agreed to the virtual agent’s offer before the
sixth round. The reason for doing that was because those
participants would not have experienced the entirety of the
virtual agent’s emotional facial displays. The interaction
emotion and framing was significant based on this exclusion
criteria, F (2, 147) = 3.35, p = .038, p2 = .044. Demand
difference in the gain frame, anger emotion condition (M =
1300, SE = 290) was greater than the demand difference in
the gain frame, neutral emotion condition (M = 245, SE =
309), F (2, 147) = 3.16, p = .045, p2 = .041 (Figure 1). This
suggests that participants conceded more to the angry virtual
agent in the gain condition, which replicates previous results
(van Kleef et al., 2004). However, in the loss condition, the
virtual agent’s emotional facial display did not affect the
demand difference (Figure 1). Therefore, the gain/loss
context mediates the effect of anger emotional facial
expressions.

Negotiation Performance
First, all the demand scores were normalized so that they
were on the same scale ranging from 0-8000 possible points
available in the negotiation task. The scores in the gain frame
were already in this format; we normalized the scores of
participants in the loss frame by adding a value of 8000 to
them so that they would be in the same range as those in the
gain frame. A 3 (Emotion: Angry, Happy, Neutral) x 2
(Frame: Gain vs. Loss) ANOVA was conducted on the
demand scores.
We computed average demand over the six rounds of the
negotiation. There was no effect of emotion, F (2, 156) =
1.48, p = .23, p2 = .019. There was a significant effect of

Psychophysiological States
The behavioral results from the negotiation task replicated
previous work by Carnevale (2008). He found that average

2372

demand over the repeated rounds of the negotiation was
greater in the loss frame condition than in the gain frame
condition. This suggests that participants were more
motivated to minimize their expenses in the loss condition
compared to maximizing their profits in the gain condition.
Based on these results and the risk framing hypothesis, we
predicted that the negotiators’ neurophysiological state
would indicate challenge motivation in the loss frame.

reactivity was negative (M = -.36, SD = 1.5), which indicated
that individuals in the gain frame were threatened.
Univariate tests of the Frame by Emotion interaction
indicated that the effect was significant for the CO reactivity
measure, F (2, 107) = 4.64, p = .042, p2 = .06, and the TPR
reactivity measure, F (2, 107) = 5.6, p = .005, p2 = .095.
Bonferroni corrected simple-effects analyses were conducted
for each measure. The results suggested that
neurophysiological reactance to gain and loss frames differed
only in the happy emotion condition, F (2, 106) = 8.75, p <
.001, p2 = .142. Increased CO reactivity (M = .374, SD =
.996) and decreased TPR (M = -106, SD = 83.4) in the
loss/happy condition indicated a challenge motivational state.
In contrast, CO reactivity decreased (M = -.634, SD = .889)
and TPR increased (M = 75.4, SD = 205) in the gain/happy
condition, which indicated a threat motivational state (Figure
2).

Discussion

Physiological reactance scores were calculated by
subtracting the CO and TPR measures of last minute of
baseline from those in the first minute of the task.1 A
multivariate ANOVA was conducted on these measures with
the independent variables of Frame (gain vs. loss) and
Emotion (angry, happy, and neutral). The multivariate tests
indicated a significant effect of Frame, F (2, 106) = 3.6, p =
.03, p2 = .063, and a significant Frame by Emotion
interaction, F (4, 214) = 4.0, p = .004, p2 = .07. The effect of
Emotion was not significant, F < 1.
Univariate tests indicated that the effect of Frame was
significant for the CO reactivity measure, F (1, 107) = 5.32,
p = .023, p2 = .047. In the loss condition, CO reactivity was
positive (M = .12, SD = .88), which indicated that individuals
in the loss frame were challenged. In the gain condition, CO

In summary, the results here indicate both conscious and nonconscious reactions to contextual cues such as framing. The
behavioral performance during the negotiation task suggests
that participants in the loss frame were more demanding
relative to those in the gain frame. Analysis of
neurophysiological states also supports this behavioral
finding that those in the loss frame were more motivated to
profit from the negotiation. Cardiovascular measures indicate
that individuals in the loss frame exhibited a pattern of
physiological responses indicative of a challenge
motivational state.
Seery et al. (2009) did not report whether framing affected
task performance on the cognitive test whereas our study
showed a similar pattern across both the cardiovascular
responses and the behavioral performance in the negotiation
task. In particular, the results in this study suggest that
individuals in a loss frame are not only in a challenge
motivational state, but also demand more in the negotiation.
These results provide a novel contribution to Prospect
Theory, namely that peripheral neurophysiological measures
can index when individuals are more motivated to take
greater risks in order to avoid losses, because “Losses loom
larger than gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, p. 279).”
Cardiovascular physiology is a nonconscious autonomic
process, but negotiation behavior is under conscious control.
The fact that two drastically different types of data produced
congruent findings serves to strengthen our results.
A positive emotional facial expression displayed by the
embodied virtual agent did not seem to have the same effect
as a positive mood induction (Carnevale, 2008). There are at
least two possible factors that could account for this. First,
interpersonal emotional expressions can have complex
effects on observers beyond mere emotional contagion as

identical facial expressions can lead to different
interpretations based on context (Barrett, Mesquita, &
Gendron, 2011; Choi et al., 2015; Khooshabeh et al., 2013;
Szczurek, Monin, & Gross, 2012). Therefore, it is possible
that the appraisal of the embodied agent’s smile in the loss
frame condition could be different from the appraisal in the
gain frame condition due to changes in context. The second
factor that might account for why a positive facial expression
did not have the same effect as Carnevale’s mood induction
paradigm could be due to slight differences in the
experimental protocol. Embodied virtual agents in this study
displayed emotional facial expressions at a few distinct times
throughout the negotiation. Conversely, the positive mood
induction in Carnevale’s study was only done before and after
the instructions, but not during the actual negotiation. This
difference in the timing of the affect might account for the
different outcomes in framing compared to Carnevale (2008).
Results can help generate design guidelines for virtual
agent developers to create negotiation scenarios that convey
a gain frame if the goal is to make negotiators demand less
from a negotiation agent. For the design of training systems,
the goal might be to motivate negotiators more positively
when they are learning effective negotiation. To accomplish
that, negotiation tutors could engender a neurophysiological
state of positive motivation (i.e., challenge).
