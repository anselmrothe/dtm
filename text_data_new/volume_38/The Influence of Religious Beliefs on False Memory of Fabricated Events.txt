and politics can contribute to group belonging and may
also lead one to recall events in line with those beliefs.
Frenda et al. (2013) investigated the relationship
between political beliefs attitudes toward events, and
memory by presenting Democrats and Republicans with
images depicting political events. Participants were then
asked whether they remembered the event and how they
felt about the event. They were not asked how strongly
they remembered the event. Not only were participants
more likely to recall a fabricated event consistent with
their political views, but they also recalled feeling
emotions consistent with their attitudes toward the party
in question. For example, Democrats were more likely to
falsely remember Bush vacationing during Hurricane
Katrina and to report feeling more outraged about the
event. Republicans, on the other hand were more likely to
falsely remember events negatively depicting Democrats,
such as Obama shaking hands with the Iranian president.
On the other hand, fabricated events depicting Hillary
Clinton airing an attack ad linking Obama to Rev. Wright
or Joe Lieberman voting guilty during President Clinton’s
impeachment trial were not remembered because there
was low congruence between their political attitudes and
how they felt about the event. These findings support
previous research suggesting that real memories are
influenced by one’s positive or negative attitudes toward
an event, in addition to being influenced by one’s beliefs
about events. However, such research reveals mixed
results and a recent study showed that people may
remember positive and negative life events equally well
(Waters et al., 2013). In addition, emotions toward events
may promote memory for features of events, but not
overall accuracy of the memories (Earles et al., 2016).
Less is known about the role of affect on false memories.
In the present study, we were interested in examining
the effects of religious affiliation and strength of religious
beliefs on false memory for plausible news events some
of which had actually occurred, and some of which had
not. Although we expected participants to be more likely
to falsely remember events consistent with their religious
beliefs (or lack thereof), it is possible that, for example,
some events portraying religion may be recalled by

Abstract
Previous research has indicated that memories can be
modified in conjunction with one’s attitudes, in particular,
political beliefs. The current study extended this finding by
focusing on the relationship between differing religious
beliefs and false memories for news events. We predicted
that religious people would be more inclined to remember
fabricated news events positively depicting religion and
less likely to remember events negatively depicting religion
compared to non-religious people. Opposite effects were
predicted for events depicting atheism. In contrast, we
found that religious people were more likely to falsely
remember both events depicting religion positively and
negatively compared to non-religious individuals.
However, the extent to which individuals felt positively
about the events interacted with religious beliefs to predict
reported false memories. Religious individuals were more
likely to remember events if they felt positively about them
whereas atheists were more likely to remember events if
they felt negatively about them.

False memory refers to mistaken recollection of events
or aspects of events that never occurred as if they actually
happened. Elizabeth Loftus and colleagues have
conducted numerous studies on this phenomenon. In one
of the first studies to investigate false memory, Loftus and
Palmer (1974) showed participants videos of a car
accident and then asked them questions regarding the
accident. More participants falsely remembered seeing
broken glass when the verb “smashed” was used versus
when the verb “hit” was used. This seminal study was one
of the first to indicate how malleable memory can be, and
how easily it is influenced by leading questions – a
finding that has contributed to stricter guidelines for
witness interrogations (Loftus, 1993).
Further research has identified many possible
influences on false memory, such as plausibility of events
(Pezdek, Finger, & Hodge, 1997) and prior expectations
(Macrae, Scholoerscheidt, Bodenhausen, & Milne, 2002;
Vendetti et al., 2014). In addition, group identification can
influence pre-existing beliefs and bias memory (Van
Bavel and Cunningham, 2012). Beliefs regarding religion

nonreligious people if the religious event was similar to
their experiences of religion (Pezdek, Finger, & Hodge,
1997).
It was expected that Christians, compared to atheists
and agnostics, would be more likely to falsely remember
an event that positively described a Christian or an event
that negatively depicted nonbelievers, such as atheists.
Similarly, nonbelievers were expected to falsely
remember events that were consistent with their nonreligious views, such as events depicting religion as
causing harm rather than doing good. Because the role of
religious beliefs and valence in predicting false memories
had not previously been examined, our study was
designed to investigate whether effects existed, not to
reveal underlying mechanisms for such possible
associations.

To assess memory for false events, participants were
given a memory task in which they were presented with
eight images corresponding to news stories that depicted
four actual events (one in which religion was depicted
positively and one in which religion was depicted
negatively, one in which atheism was depicted positively,
one in which atheism was depicted negatively) and four
that depicted fabricated events from the same categories.
Procedure
Participants completed several online questionnaires via
surveymonkey.com. Participants provided information
about their sex, GPA, political, and religious affiliations.
Participants who reported being affiliated with
Christianity or other religions, or religious without any
affiliation were coded as religious. Those who reported
being atheist or agnostic were coded as non-religious.
They were then administered the scales described above
along with two additional scales that were not included in
the analyses. After the questionnaires, the participants
were presented with the memory task. Images of events
were presented in the same pseudorandom order for all
participants. For each image, participants responded as to
how strongly they recalled the event on a four point Likert
scale (not at all to very well) and how they felt about the
event on a five point Likert scale (very negatively to very
positively) with lack of memory at the middle point
(valence).

Materials
To assess the strength of participants’ religious beliefs,
the religious fundamentalism (Altemeyer & Hunsberger,
2004) and true religious belief scales (Zeigler-Hill &
Shackelford, unpublished) were administered

Results
Data was examined for normality and the memory scores
were found to have a positive skew. Memory scores were
therefore transformed using a logarithmic transformation
in order to correct for this positive skewness. Memory and
valence scores were then standardized before being
entered into analyses. We conducted bivariate correlations
between the predictor variables of religious category,
memory for true events, and valence for the false events,
and the outcome variable of memory for false events.
Correlation results revealed a high positive correlation
between false memory for the event negatively depicting
religion and valence of this event (r= -.59, p< .001).
Religious category was highly correlated with our
religiosity measure (described below), r=.62, p< .001.
We then performed hierarchical multiple regression
analyses where we regressed each log-transformed and
standardized false memory score on to strength of
religious beliefs and valence (measure of positive regard)
for the corresponding false event. Consistent with Frenda
et al. (2013), the transformed memory score for the
corresponding true event was entered into the regression
at the first step as a control. In addition, religious category
was added into this step to see if strength of religious
beliefs accounted for any variability above and beyond
what was accounted for by religious affiliation.

The Religious Fundamentalism Scale is a 20 item
scale with a Cronbach’s alpha typically ranging from .93
to .95. It measures the extent to which one views religion
as a single, absolute truth. Like the dogmatism scale, it
can be related to authoritarianism (Altemeyer &
Hunsberger, 1992). The scale was revised in 2004. An
example of an item is, “God has given mankind a
complete, unfailing guide to happiness and salvation,
which must be totally followed.” The items are answered
based on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from very strongly
disagree to very strongly agree ( = 95).
The True Religious Beliefs scale is a 59 question
compilation of items from several scales including six
items from the Shortened Post-Critical Belief Scale
(Duriez, Soenens, & Hutsebaut, 2004), ten items from the
Beliefs and Values Scale (King et al., 2005), two items
from the God Image Inventory (Lawrence, 1997), five
items from The God Delusion (Dawkins, 2006, pg207208), four items from the Literal, Anti-Literal, and
Mythological Scales (Hunt, 1972), and additional
measures as developed by Zeigler-Hill and Shackelford
(Unpublished data). In the current study, we obtained a
Cronbach’s alpha of .98 for the complete scale.

Correlation analyses between the True Religious Beliefs
Scale and Religious Fundamentalism scores suggested a
large correlation between the two scores (r = .81). To
eliminate the effect of multicollinearity, and because the
two scales reduced to a single component using PCA, the
scores were standardized and averaged to create a
composite religiosity score. This score was entered into
the second step of the regression model and allowed to
interact with valence in the third step. Results of the
regression analyses are displayed in Table 1.

After controlling for religious category and memory for
the true event, valence for the false event (β = .28, t =
7.39, p > .001) was positively associated with memory for
the false event.
Religiosity interacted with valence to predict false
memory (β= .12, t= 2.96, p= .003). Predicted values for
this interaction are presented in Figure 2. To further
understand this interaction, simple slopes tests were
conducted for individuals high and low in religiosity. For
both participants high (β= .37, t= 7.75, p < .001) and low
in religiosity (β= .16, t= 2.71, p= .007), valence was
positively associated with false memory. Participants
were more likely to falsely remember events negatively
depicting religion if they felt positively about them.

Memory for false positive religious events
Memory for the true event (β=.26, t= 6.59, p < .001)
and religious category (β= .08, t= 2.11, p= .04) were
positively associated with false memory for the event
positively depicting religion. After controlling for
religious category and memory for the true event, valence
of the false event was positively associated with false
memory (β= .46, t= 13.13, p< .001)
A significant interaction was found between strength of
religious beliefs and valence of the false event (β =-.08, t=
-2.24, p= .03). Predicted values for this interaction are
presented in Figure 1. Simple slopes tests were conducted
for individuals who were high and low in religiosity. For
both those lower in religiosity (β= .55, t= 10.53, p < .001),
and those higher in religiosity (β= .40, t= 8.93, p < .001),
valence was positively associated with false memory.
Participants were more likely to falsely remember events
positively depicting religion if they felt positively about
them.

religious events are presented illustrating the interaction
of religiosity and valence at values that are one standard
deviation above and below their respective means.

Memory for false, positive atheist events
Memory for the true event (β = .33, t = 8.27, p > .001)
was positively associated with memory for the false
event. After controlling for religious category and
memory for the true event, valence for the false event was
negatively associated with false memory for the negative
religious event (β = -.19, t = -4.69, p > .001).
Religiosity interacted with valence for the false event to
predict memory for the false event (β= -.35, t= -8.89, p <
.001). Predicted values for this interaction are presented in
Figure 3. To further understand this interaction, simple
slopes tests were conducted for individuals high and low
in religiosity. For participants high in religiosity, valence
was negatively associated with false memory (β= -.55, t=
- 9.92, p< .001), but valence did not significantly impact
false memory for participants low in religiosity (β= -.04, t
= -.87, p= .39). Only participants high in religiosity were
more likely to falsely remember events positively
depicting atheism if they felt negatively about them.

events are presented illustrating the interaction of
religiosity and valence at values that are one standard

Memory for false, negative religious events
Memory for the true event (β= .21, t= 5.12, p< .001)
and religious category (β= .12, t= 3.00, p= .003) were
positively associated with memory for the false event.

atheists in a negative light. The interaction between
strength of religious beliefs and valence for the false
event was not significant (β = .02, t= .69, p = .49).

Discussion
The results of our regression analyses support the
notion that religious beliefs interact with regard for the
events to impact false memory formation. Religious
participants and non-religious participants falsely
remembered the fabricated events consistent with their
religious beliefs, but differently as a function of how they
felt about various events. Religious participants were
more likely to remember religious events if they felt
positively about them and atheist events if they felt
negatively about them. Of particular interest is the finding
that both religious and nonreligious participants were
more likely to remember the event negatively depicting
religion if they felt positively about it.
The latter finding could be explained by features of the
events themselves. Because only a single event was used
for each category of events, it is possible that
idiosyncratic features of the individual events had
unexpected influence on participants’ valence ratings and
memories. For instance, the image of the Pope (Figure 5),
while telling a negative story, may have been more salient
than the caption itself. The event depicts a cover-up of
child sexual abuse by Pope Francis (when this was in-fact

religious events are presented illustrating the interaction

deviation above and below their respective means.

Memory for false, negative atheist events
Memory for the true event (β = .23, t = 5.72, p > .001) and
religious category (β= .14, t= 3.58, p< .001) were
positively associated with memory for the false event.
After controlling for religious category and memory for
the true event, valence for the false event was negatively
associated with false memory (β = -.57, t = -17.04, p >
.001). That is, people who had stronger negative feelings
about the event and those who were more religious were

possibility in a future study.

them. Perhaps religious people were able to reappraise the
negative religious events as more positive.
The finding that false memory is moderated by valence
is consistent with Frenda et al. (2013). For example,
Republicans in this study were more likely to falsely
remember events positively depicting Republicans if they
felt positively about the event. Conversely, if such
participants felt negatively about an event negatively
depicting democrats, they were more likely to remember
it. This finding, as well as the findings from our study are
consistent with the positive correlation between
conservatism and religious attitudes found by Pennycook
et al. (2011).
The current study is the first study to directly address
the relationship between religiosity and false memory.
Further research can focus on investigating the interaction
between religious affiliation and attitudes towards the
event. In addition, future research could investigate how
different religious viewpoints may influence false
memory (i.e. Christian events versus Jewish or Muslim
events).
Our study is limited by the use of a college sample.
Data from college students may not necessarily be
generalizable to the overall population particularly with
regards to beliefs and memory for public events. In
addition, our sample was predominately Christian and
female.
Because
our
population
included
a
disproportionate amount of religious and nonreligious
participants, the small amount of nonreligious participants
may not be truly representative of the atheist population.
We are currently addressing this limitation with a second
study using a community sample.
Our results suggest that religiosity may influence false
memory for religious events. This further adds to the
literature suggesting that memory may be biased by prior
expectations and attitudes. In addition, our research
provides further evidence that prior beliefs may interact
with attitudes towards an event to predict false memory.
By expanding the existing literature, we have shown that
memory can be influence by more ways in which we
imagined.

The false negative religious event depicted Pope
Francis covering up child sexual abuse.

Another possible explanation for the finding is that
negative events are in themselves more salient than
positive events. Pratto and John (1991) suggested that
people automatically attend to negative more than
positive stimuli. Other studies, however, also point to the
impact of emotion. Laney, Campbell, Heuer, and
Reisberg (2004) found that participants remembered
emotionally-arousing information better than more neutral
information. Kensigner and Corkin (2003) reached a
similar conclusion in finding that memory was greater for
events that were both negative and emotional. It is
possible that both religious individuals, and atheists, who
identify as being non-religious (which is defined more by
the absence than presence of a particular belief system),
feel more strongly about events aligned with the presence
rather than the absence of religion. The results of the
regression analysis are consistent with this literature given
that there was a large effect of valence on memory for the
false negative atheist event, which depicted atheists
burning a church. This finding may result from
participants both having strong negative feelings for the
events and strong memories for the events. This event, as
well as the true event involving the Westboro Baptist
Church, can be considered to be both negative and
emotionally-arousing.
Whereas negative events may be salient, it is also
possible that religious people tend to evaluate events more
positively. Vishkin et al. (2015) found that religious
people were more likely to effectively reappraise negative
information in more positive light. This finding could
explain why religious people generally remembered
events depicting religion if they felt positively about
