Psychological Basis of Creativity
We have looked at several hypotheses to account for
the cultural revolution of the Upper Paleolithic. Each
has merit, but none provides a satisfying explanation for
this burst of creativity. To determine more precisely
what gave rise to the modern human mind, it is useful
to examine the psychological basis of creativity.

Attributes of Creative Individuals
Martindale

identified

a

cluster

of

attributes

associated with high creativity. A first one is defocused
attention: the tendency not to focus exclusively on the
relevant aspects of a situation, but notice also seemingly
irrelevant aspects (Dewing & Battye, 1971; Dykes &
McGhie, 1976; Mendelsohn, 1976). A related attribute
is high sensitivity (Martindale, 1977, 1999; Martindale
& Armstrong, 1974), including sensitivity to subliminal
impressions; stimuli that are perceived but of which one
is not conscious of having perceived (Smith & Van de
Meer, 1994).
Creative individuals also tend to have flat associative

Contextual focus is not a matter of more memory, but
of a more sophisticated way of using memory; thus the
proposal is consistent with there being no increase in
brain size at this time. It is consistent with a point made
by Bickerton (1990) and Leakey (1984) that brain size
