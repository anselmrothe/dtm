therefore, be useful for the child to integrate multiple cues in
language acquisition (Christiansen & Dale, 2001). This
contrasts with a perspective that assumes that cues may act
individually as triggers for structuring the language (Pinker,
1997).
Phonological and distributional cues are an interesting test
case in exploring the issue of whether cues operate
individually or integratively. As a test case, we assess the
noun/verb distinction. In the next two sections we consider
phonological and distributional cues that have been
proposed as useful for syntactic categorisation. We then
discuss how the “typicality” of a word with respect to these
cues may influence lexical access. Finally, we present the
studies testing phonological and distributional typicality in
the lexical decision, naming, and noun/verb decision tasks.

Abstract
Information about the syntactic category of a word can be
derived from a number of complementary sources. We focus
here on phonological and distributional cues for
distinguishing nouns and verbs that have been proposed as
useful for language acquisition. In this paper we assessed the
extent to which this information affects lexical processing in
adults. We hypothesised that the phonological or
distributional typicality of a word with respect to its syntactic
class would influence lexical access – words that were more
typical of their class would be accessed more quickly. We
tested this in three tasks: naming, lexical decision, and a
noun/verb decision task. Words that were phonologically
typical of their syntactic category were responded to more
quickly in lexical decision and naming tasks. Distributional
typicality related only to the noun/verb decision task.

Phonological cues for categorisation

Introduction
Information from a variety of sources has been hypothesised
as useful for determining the syntactic category of a word.
Such syntactic categorisation is important in language
acquisition as a precursor to the child understanding the
relationship between speech sounds and objects in the
environment. In this paper we concentrate on phonological
and distributional information that distinguishes nouns and
verbs. Such information is useful for language acquisition,
and early acquisition has been shown to exert a profound
influence on processing in adults (Ellis & Lambon Ralph,
2000), therefore this information may impact on the
processes of lexical access in adults. We present data from
three lexical processing tasks: naming, lexical decision, and
a noun/verb decision task to test this hypothesis. Before we
discuss the phonological and distributional cues, we provide
the background to this research in terms of syntactic
categorisation in language acquisition.
There are many cues that are potentially useful in
determining the syntactic category of a word, and we are
interested in determining the identity, availability and use of
these cues in early language acquisition. Cues may be
derived from numerous sources – phonological, contextual,
gestural, emotional, and so on – but cues are unreliable
when considered alone for determining the syntactic (or
semantic) category to which the word belongs. It may,

Kelly (1992) reported several phonological variables that
distinguished nouns and verbs. In English, for example,
nouns tend to be longer than verbs, and tend to have stressed
initial syllables as opposed to stress on the second syllable
(e.g., record and record). Such cues have been shown to
predict category selection for nonwords, such that longer
nonwords are more likely to be used in noun contexts by
participants, and shorter nonwords used in verb contexts
(Cassidy & Kelly, 1991). We compiled a set of 15
phonological cues that have been proposed as potentially
useful in distinguishing words from different parts of speech
(Durieux & Gillis, 2001; Kelly, 1992; Shi, Morgan &
Allopena, 1998).
We derived all monosyllabic nouns and verbs that
belonged to only one syntactic category, according to the
CELEX database. This resulted in a set of 2029 nouns and
1986 verbs. We entered the 15 phonological cues as factors
into a linear discriminant analysis with noun/verb status as
dependent variable. Whereas each cue was unreliable for
discriminating nouns and verbs when used alone, the
combined set of cues correctly classified 60.9% of nouns
and 67.0% of verbs in a leave-one-out cross-validation
analysis.
We hypothesised that the extent to which a word shares
phonological cues with other words in the same syntactic

centre of the verb cluster than they are to the noun cluster.
category to which it belongs would influence the response
latency to that word. Figure 1 shows the rationale for our
hypothesis. Nouns tend to cluster in phonological space, as
do verbs. However, some nouns are more like other verbs
than other nouns in terms of their phonological cues. If
phonological cues are used for acquisition of category
information and this imparts an influence on the structure of
the lexicon, then nouns close to the centre of the category
will be responded to quickly. In contrast, “verby” nouns,
with a clash between category and phonological form, will
be responded to less quickly.
We assessed the probability of the category membership
for each of the nouns and the verbs in the discriminant
analysis. A noun that shares few phonological cues with
other nouns has a low probability of noun membership, and
a noun that shares many phonological cues has a high score.
We predicted that nouns with high scores would be
processed more quickly. We term this measure noun/verb
phonological typicality. We next consider distributional
cues for syntactic categorisation.

Distributional cues for categorisation
The contextual information of a word is extremely useful as
a reflection of syntactic category. Indeed, the specific
context in which a particular lexical token is found will
generally provide sufficient information for the syntactic
category to be guessed correctly. However, measures of
distributional information for words have largely
concentrated on providing generic methods for reflecting
syntactic or semantic groupings. Such models do not
assume that the input has been parsed, but rather have
sought to provide simple n-gram models1 of the language
that are appropriate for the early stages of language
acquisition. Such models rather drastically underestimate
the potential influence of context, but are useful for
providing a lower-bound for the availability of information
from such a source.
Fries (1952) suggested that nouns and verbs tend to occur
in different context templates. For example, only a noun

N-gram models reflect the statistics of the language by counting
co-occurrences in groups of n words. A bigram model will count
the co-occurrences of two words, whereas a trigram model will
count occurrences of triples of words.

occurs in the context ‘the ____ is/was/are good’. To test the
extent to which this information was useful, Redington,
Chater and Finch (1998) generated cluster analyses of words
according to counts of their contextual occurrence in a fourword window from a child-directed speech corpus, and
found that the different syntactic classes clustered together
with a high degree of accuracy and completeness.
Chiarello, Shears and Lund (1999) derived a measure of
noun-verb distributional typicality. A co-occurrence context
vector (from Lund & Burgess, 1996) was determined for
each word. Next, the distance from the target word vector to
that of each noun vector was computed, and subtracted from
the mean distance from the target word vector to each verb
vector. Nouns that occur in contexts similar to other nouns
will have a higher score, whereas nouns which occur in
atypical noun contexts will have a low score. This score was
termed the noun-verb distance difference (NVDD). Hereon,
we refer to this measure as noun/verb distributional
typicality.
The overlap between the words with distributional
typicality scores from Chiarello et al. (1999) and those from
our own database was small, and so we reproduced
distributional typicality scores using distances between
context vector representations (McDonald & Shillcock,
2001). On the words that did overlap, our distributional
typicality scores were correlated with those from Chiarello
et al. (1999), r(319) = 0.328, p < .001. The correlation was
low but highly significant – and, perhaps more importantly,
our typicality measure was derived from co-occurrence
vectors that produced a qualitatively similar level of
semantic clustering to that of Lund and Burgess (1996).
We next present analyses of the role of phonological
typicality in terms of phonological and distributional
information for the processing of nouns and verbs. We
assessed the contribution of phonological and distributional
typicality in accounting for variance in response times in a
naming task, a lexical decision task, and a noun/verb
decision task.

Analysis 1: Noun/verb naming
Several variables contribute towards response times in a
naming task. We wanted to assess the contribution of
typicality over and above these other variables. Hierarchical
regression analysis enables key variables to be entered after
other variables have been accounted for as predictors of
response times. In this regard, we employ the rationale of
Spieler and Balota (1997), who found that several variables
contributed towards accounting for variance in naming
latencies. Position and manner of articulation of onset
phoneme, log-frequency, orthographic neighbourhood size
and length were all significant. Kacinik, Shears and
Chiarello (2000) found that familiarity was also a significant
contributor towards accounting for variance in lexical
decision response times, and so we also included a measure
of familiarity from Balota, Cortese and Pilotti (1999). The
naming latency data were taken from Spieler and Balota’s
(1997) naming latencies for 2820 words, which were
produced by 31 undergraduates at Washington University.
All unambiguous nouns and verbs with familiarity,

phonological and distributional typicality measures, and
naming latency data were entered into a hierarchical
regression analysis. In accordance with Spieler and Balota
(1997), we first entered onset-phoneme characteristics in
terms of the 13 phonemic features that they employed in
their regression analyses of naming time (such as affricative,
bilabial, stop, voiced). Next, we entered log-frequency,
neighbourhood size, length and familiarity. Finally, we
entered phonological and distributional typicality. The
results are shown in Table 1.
The noun data accorded with the analyses on the whole
set of words presented in Spieler and Balota (1997), with
log-frequency and neighbourhood size as significant
predictors. Familiarity was also found to be a significant
predictor. For the verb data, neighbourhood size and logfrequency were not significant predictors, but length and
familiarity were. Distributional typicality did not
significantly predict naming response times, but
phonological typicality did contribute towards accounting
for variance in verb naming times. Phonological typicality
acted in the predicted direction: verbs that were more
typical of the phonological properties of verbs were
responded to more quickly than those that were less typical.
Words from different syntactic classes are influenced
differentially by the psycholinguistic variables.
In order to test the maximal contribution towards
accounting for variance by the typicality measures, we
reversed the step order for the regression analysis. When the
typicality measures were entered first, phonological
typicality contributed significantly to accounting for

variance for nouns, but not for verbs (β weight = -.164, t = 3.195, p = .002; β weight = .086, t = .714, p = .478,
respectively). For distributional typicality, there was no
evident contribution for noun naming latencies, but a
marginally significant contribution to verb response times
(β weight = -.076, t = -1.484, p = .139; β weight = .215, t =
1.788, p = .078, respectively). One of the phonological cues
related to length of words in phonemes, and so overlap
between phonological typicality and length may have
obscured typicality effects in the initial hierarchical
regression analyses.

Analysis 2: Noun/verb Lexical Decision
Lexical decision latencies were taken from the corpus
produced by Balota, Cortese and Pilotti (1999), with data
from 30 Washington University undergraduate students who
were tested on 2906 monosyllabic words, and an equal
number of nonwords.
We performed a hierarchical regression analysis on the
word lexical decision response times, with the 13 onset
phoneme variables entered at the first step, log-frequency,
neighbourhood size, length, and familiarity entered at the
second step, and phonological and distributional typicality
entered at the third step. The results are shown in Table 2.
The onset-phoneme variables did not account for as much
variance in response times to lexical decision as they did in
the naming task. At step 2, for nouns log-frequency,
familiarity and imageability were significant predictors,
whereas for verbs familiarity was the only significant

predictor. Again, distributional typicality was not a
significant predictor, though phonological typicality did
predict response times for both nouns and verbs. In each
case, greater phonological typicality of the phonological
properties of the word in its class reflected quicker
responses to the word.
When the step order was reversed in the regression
analysis, phonological typicality was again a significant
predictor of both noun and verb lexical decision latencies
(β weight = -.134, t = -2.656, p = .008; β weight = .251, t =
2.102, p = .039, respectively). Again, distributional
typicality was not found to contribute towards accounting
for variance in response times (for nouns, β weight = -.073,
t = -1.440, p = .151; for verbs, β weight = .024, t = .203, p =
.840).

Experiment 1: Noun/verb Decision Task
Kacinik and Chiarello (2002) found that noun-verb
distributional typicality was a significant contributor to
accounting for the variance of response times in a noun/verb
decision task. In a regression analysis, distributional
typicality and imageability were significant for predicting
response times for both nouns and verbs, with familiarity
also contributing to verb response time. We wished to test
whether both phonological and distributional typicality
contributed towards accounting for response times.

Method
Participants Forty native English speaking postgraduates
and undergraduates at the University of Warwick
participated, and were paid £1 for taking part.
Stimuli We used all 71 verbs for which we had measures of
familiarity and phonological and distributional typicality.
We paired these with 71 nouns which were selected to
match the range of frequency and length found in the verb
stimuli.
Procedure Participants were required to judge whether a
word was a noun (press “n”) or a verb (press “v”). For each
trial, a fixation cross appeared at the centre of the screen for
400ms, followed by the 100ms blank screen, followed by
the word, which disappeared on response and was replaced
after 1000ms with the fixation cross for the next trial. The
142 trials were preceded by 8 practice trials comprised of 4
nouns and 4 verbs that were not in the stimulus set. As in
Kacinik and Chiarello (2002), participants were instructed
that nouns were words naming a quality, person, place or
thing, and that verbs were words that refer to an action or
the occurrence of an event, and examples were given of
each.

Results
We performed a hierarchical multiple regression analysis on
response times for nouns and verbs separately, with onset
phoneme variables entered at the first step, log-frequency,
neighbourhood size, length, and familiarity entered at the
second step, and phonological and distributional typicality

entered at the third step. Table 3 shows the results for nouns
and for verbs.
Both nouns and verbs had length as a significant
predictor. Neither nouns nor verbs demonstrated an effect of
phonological typicality, though we replicated the effect of
noun-verb distributional typicality for nouns found by
Kacinik and Chiarello (2002). Nouns that occurred in more
typical contexts were responded to more quickly. However,
there was a marginally significant effect of typicality for
verbs, which was in the same direction – meaning that verbs
which occurred in more typical noun contexts were
responded to more quickly. This is in contrast to the finding
by Kacinik and Chiarello (2002), who found that verbs
which were more distributionally typical of the verb class
were responded to more quickly. Kacinik and Chiarello
(2002) used a larger set of words (152 nouns and 137 verbs)
and so the additional power of their analyses may have
revealed effects that were not significant in our data.
Another possibility is that the distributional typicality
measure we employed was somehow importantly different
to that used in their study. The correlation between the
Chiarello et al. (1999) measure and our distributional
typicality measure accounted for only a moderate amount of
variance.

Local distributional typicality
Distributional typicality, as measured by NVDD, was not
successful in predicting response times for naming or lexical

decision tasks. Our measure of distributional typicality was
derived from co-occurrence counts across a window of 10
words, taking into account only content words. Such broad
windows of co-occurrences blur the syntactic information,
and have been used rather as a reflection of semantics.
Measures of contextual typicality in terms of co-occurrence
with function words, and in a more local contextual window
may better reflect the syntactic typicality of nouns and
verbs.
To this end, we counted the proportion of times that each
unambiguous noun and verb occurred immediately after a
set of context words in the 100 million word British
National Corpus (Burnard, 1995). We chose the twenty
most frequent words from the corpus as the context words.
This provided a 20-dimensional vector for each word, which
we entered into a discriminant analysis with noun/verb as
dependent variable. As for the phonological typicality
measure, we derived a probability of classification as a noun
or a verb for each word. The classification was extremely
accurate, with 99.0% of nouns and 88.4% of verbs correctly
classified in a leave-one-out cross validation analysis. We
repeated the multiple regression analyses for naming
response time and lexical decision response time, replacing
noun/verb distributional difference with the new measure of
local distributional typicality. The results were very similar,
with phonological typicality significant for the same tests,
and distributional typicality not contributing significantly to
accounting for variance in latencies.

Discussion
We found a significant effect of phonological typicality on
verb naming latencies. We also found a significant effect of
phonological typicality on lexical decision latencies for both
nouns and verbs. This latter result is especially surprising,
as speech production is not directly implicated in lexical
decision, and yet the extent to which a word conformed to
phonological typicality for its class influenced processing
time. This effect may reflect the influence of graphemic
typicality, as nouns share similar letters in similar positions
within the word. It is still a surprising effect given that the
onset variables account for so much less variance in the
lexical decision task compared to the naming task.
The reliability of phonological typicality across naming
and lexical decision tasks for verbs indicates that it is an
important factor in describing the processing of single
words. The extent to which a word resembles the
phonological characteristics of other members of its
syntactic class influences reaction times. Words with a good
match are responded to more quickly than words where
there is a mismatch between category and typicality. This
suggests that syntactic information is engaged during lexical
access in single-word reading tasks. We hypothesise that the
speeded access for lexical items typical of their syntactic
category is due to cohort activity from other items in that
category. This is reminiscent of the gang-effect
explanation proposed by Kelly, Shillcock and Monaghan
(1996) for activating the class of function words. Function
words are closer to one another in phonological space than
they are to content words, and activation of a target function

814

word is assisted by partial activation of other function words
that are close in phonological space. The analyses presented
here indicate that further discriminations can be made within
the content word class, and, furthermore, that the gangeffect is greatest for words that are closest to the
phonological exemplar for their category.
Cassidy and Kelly (1991) have focused primarily on
individual phonological cues, such as syllable length. Our
analyses have merged several phonological measures
together, though it is possible that certain phonological cues
may have an individual impact on determining phonological
typicality. We performed a stepwise discriminant analysis
on noun/verb category for all unambiguous monosyllabic
words with the 15 phonological cues entered as factors.
Factors were entered into the analysis if the probability of F
was less than .05. Five cues were entered: length in
phonemes (P1), proportion of coronal consonants (P2),
final-consonant voicing (P3), number of consonants in the
onset (P4), and proportion of nasal consonants (P5). The
leave-one-out classification was similar in accuracy to the
original discriminant analysis we performed (61.8% of
nouns and 67.3% of verbs correctly classified).
We entered these five phonological cues in place of
phonological typicality in the third step of the regression
analysis. For noun naming, only P3 was a significant
contributor. For verb naming, P1, P2, P4 and P3 all
contributed. No cue contributed for noun lexical decision,
and for verb lexical decision, P1, P3 and P5 contributed. P3
contributed as a predictor for three measures, but no
individual cue reflected the effect of phonological typicality
found for noun lexical decision. In each analysis, different
cues seemed to contribute towards accounting for variance,
and this suggests an integrated use of the various cues better
accounts for the naming and lexical decision latency data.
Integrated cues provide a better explanation of the typicality
effects than do single trigger cues.
We have shown that differences between nouns and verbs
are evident even without the oft-cited difference in terms of
syllable length as a single cue
all the words in our
analyses were monosyllabic. We predict that the effects we
have found for monosyllabic words will be stronger still for
polysyllabic words. Discriminant analysis conducted on
unambiguous nouns/verbs of all syllabic lengths resulted in
a more accurate classification than just on monosyllabic
words (approaching 75% accurate classification). For
polysyllabic words, phonological typicality matches
syntactic class better, and we suggest that mismatches
between phonological properties and syntactic class would
impact on processing to a greater degree.
Distributional typicality was not found to predict naming
or lexical decision response times. This corroborates
Kacinik and Chiarello s (2002) study where distributional
typicality was only a predictor for a noun-verb decision
task. We partially reproduced the effect of distributional
typicality on the noun-verb decision task, when the
contextual window was wide (+/-5 words), or narrow (-1
word). The noun-verb decision requires the participant to
evoke implicit knowledge of words that is difficult to
retrieve. Distributional typicality appears to assist the
elicitation of such information, whereas phonological

typicality, in contrast, did not predict noun/verb decision
times. Noun/verb decision, therefore, appears to be tapping
rather different processes to those involved in naming and
lexical decision tasks. These latter tasks have been taken to
reflect general processes of lexical access.
We have been successful in demonstrating that nouns and
verbs have different variables as predictors. The
contribution of different variables in predicting variance in
naming response times indicates that even grapheme to
phoneme correspondence is modulated by syntactic
category. For instance, log-frequency is predictive only of
naming time for nouns, and, indeed for verbs, it has a nonsignificant but reversed effect. Consequently, large scale
item analyses of naming or lexical decision response times
ought to attend to the possibility of varying factors involved
in lexical access for different syntactic categories.

Conclusion
We found no effects of distributional information for
naming and lexical decision tasks. The influence of such
cues are more marked for the noun/verb decision task.
However, we have shown that phonological typicality
influences naming and lexical decision response latencies in
adult readers. We have focused on phonological cues that
have been proposed to be involved in constructing syntactic
category information in early language acquisition. The
influence of these phonological cues appears to be
integrative: Single cues are ineffective in accurately
discriminating between nouns and verbs, though accuracy is
significantly greater than chance when several cues are
entered simultaneously into a discriminant analysis. In
short, phonological cues employed in syntactic
categorisation exert an influence on lexical access, similar to
the influence of age of acquisition for single word
processing. The processes of early language acquisition can
be observed in adult language processing.
