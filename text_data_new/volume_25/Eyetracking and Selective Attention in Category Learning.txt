Abstract
An eyetracking version of the classic Shepard, Hovland
and Jenkins (1961) experiment was conducted. Forty years
of research has assumed that category learning includes
learning how to selectively attend to only those stimulus
dimensions useful for classification.We confirmed that participants learned to allocate their attention optimally.
However, we also found that neither associationist accounts of gradual learning nor hypothesis-testing accounts
accurately predicted the pattern of eye movements leading
up to successful learning. The implication of these results,
and the use of eyetracking technology more generally, for
categorization theory are discussed.

Selective attention has played a prominent role in most
theories of categorization ever since Roger Shepard’s influential work (Shepard, Hovland & Jenkins, 1961) demonstrating that a simple stimulus generalization account of category learning is untenable. The stimulus generalization account regarded category learning to be a process of simple
associations between stimuli and category labels. This account predicted that it should be easy for participants to associate stimuli that shared many features with one category
label, and difficult to associate such stimuli with different
labels. Unexpectedly, one important determiner of difficulty
was the number of stimulus dimensions needed for correct
classification. It has been generally accepted that this pattern
of results is best understood in terms of learners optimally
allocating their selective attention to those dimensions diagnostic of category membership (Rosch & Mervis, 1975)
Currently, such selective attention is often explicitly parameterized in computational models of categorization, as it
is in Nosofsky’s generalized context model (1986), or in
other descendents and extensions of Medin and Schaffer’s
(1978) exemplar-based context model of categorization such
as EGCM (Lamberts, 1998). It is similarly defined in prototype models, be they based on additive or multiplicative
similarity (Nosofsky, 1992; Smith & Minda, 1998). Rulebased models as well implicitly assume the operation of
selective attenion to those stimulus dimensions referred to
by the current hypothesis (i.e., rule) being tested (Smith,
Patalano, & Jonides, 1992).
In more recent years, categorization theory has developed

976

to include the mechanisms by which selective attention
changes during the course of learning. One prominent example is Kruschke’s (1992) ALCOVE, a connectionist implementation of the generalized context model that changes
attention weights as a function of error feedback. Another is
Nosofksy’s (1994) rule-plus-exception (RULEX) model of
classification learning which first performs hypothesis testing of single-dimension rules (then on multi-dimensional
rules and/or exceptions to those rules).
Despite its prominence in all modern theories of categorization, evidence for the operation of selective attention in
category learning has always amounted to demonstrations
that dimensions vary in their influence on explicit categorization judgments, not the operation of selective attention per
se (Lamberts, 1998). Accordingly, this study had two main
goals. The first was to determine if eyetracking data would
provide direct support for the claim that learners allocate
their attention so as to optimize classification performance.
The second was to determine whether the changes in the
pattern in eye movements during the course of learning was
well described by ALCOVE, RULEX, or either model. To
these ends, we performed a replication of the Shepard et al.
(1961) category learning experiment with an eyetracker.

The Shepard et al. (1961) Study
Shepard et al. (1961) constructed stimuli defined by three
binary-valued dimensions, resulting in eight stimuli which
could then be split into two categories. Division of stimuli
into categories was determined by six unique category structures, four of which are shown in Figure 1. Here, the dimensions have been arbitrarily instantiated by shape (circle vs.
triangle), color (black vs. white), and size (large vs. small).
Type I is the most basic category structure, requiring information from only a single dimension for correct classification (size in Fig. 1). The Type II structure is an exclusiveor problem along two relevant dimensions (size and shape in
Fig. 1). Type IV is a single dimension plus exception category structure (as were Shepard et al.’s Types III and V, not
shown in Fig. 1). Finally, the most complicated structure is
Type VI in which all three dimensions are equally important
for category membership. Shepard et al.’s central finding
was that the ordering among the category structures from
least to most difficult was Type I < II < (III, IV, V) < VI.
Because this ordering mirrors the number of dimensions

needed to solve each problem, it was taken as evidence for
the importance of selective attention in category learning.

Figure 2

Figure 1
We tested participants wearing an eyetracker on the four
category structures shown in Figure 1. Our first question
was whether, as predicted by all current theories of category
learning, participants would limit their attention to only
those stimulus dimensions needed to solve the Type I, II,
IV, and VI problems: 1, 2, 3, and 3 dimensions. Our second
question was whether the changes in attention (i.e., eye
movements) during learning would support a gradual or rulebased learning account. According to ALCOVE, participants should begin by examining all stimulus dimensions,
and then reduce the dimensions they fixate to the minimum
(to 1 for Type 1 and 2 for Type II). According to RULEX,
all participants should begin by examining one stimulus
dimension, and then increase the dimensions they fixate as
needed (to 2 for Type II and 3 for Types IV and VI).

Method
Participants
A total of 72 New York University undergraduates participated for class credit or for pay. Participants were tested individually and randomly assigned to conditions.

Materials
Because we were looking at eye movement data, it was crucial for the dimensions of our stimuli to be separated in
space (as in Experiment I of Shepard et al., 1961). The binary dimensions were realized by a pair of text symbols ($
and ¢, ? and !, and + and -) which we presented on a 20 inch
computer monitor set to a resolution of 1024 x 768. The
symbols were a light gray, RGB (128,128,128), Times New
Roman, 30 points, and bolded, situated 818 pixels apart on
the monitor forming an equilateral triangle. Figure 2 provides an example of one such stimulus. The assignment of
physical dimensions and location to the abstract category
structure was counterbalanced across subjects.
We used the SMI Eyelink eyetracking system. For efficiency, we recorded from a single eye. All eye movements,
button presses, and RTs were recorded.

Procedure
Each participant was first fitted and calibrated to the
eyetracker. Each subsequent learning trial consisted of a drift
correction in which the participant fixates on a small circle
that appears at the center of the stimulus allowing the
eyetracker to make small calibration adjustments that compensate for slight movements (drifts) of the eyetracker on the
participant’s head. Following the drift correction, one of the

977

eight exemplars was presented on the screen. Participants
classified the exemplar as belonging to either the “red” or
“green” category by pressing the corresponding red and green
buttons on a button box (assignment of categories to the red
or green labels was counterbalanced). Immediately after their
response they heard either a chime indicating that they were
correct or a low buzz indicating they were incorrect. The
exemplar remained visible for 4 sec. after feedback. The
stimuli were presented randomly in blocks of 8. The experiment ended if the participant completed 4 blocks in a
row without error, or if they completed all 28 blocks. After
each block, participants were informed how close they were
to this goal.

Eyetracking Dependent Variables
In addition to standard learning measures such as error rates
and number of blocks to criterion, we derived a number of
measures based on the eyetracking data. We first defined areas of interest (AOIs) as rectangles that encompassed the
physical location of each of the symbol dimensions on the
computer screen. Based on these AOIs we computed three
measures: number of dimensions fixated, proportional fixation time, and dimension priority.
Number of dimensions fixated (ranging from 0 to 3). This
is a basic measure which can be thought of as the number of
dimensions from which a participant sought information on
a particular trial. This measure is intended to tell us which
dimension(s) participants use to classify a stimulus.
Proportional fixation time (ranging from 0 to 1). This is
the amount of time spent fixating each dimension divided by
the total time spent fixating all three dimensions. This
measure is intended to provide information regarding which
dimension(s) participants found to be most important for the
classification decision.
Dimension priority (ranging from 0 to 1). Dimension
priority captures the relative order of fixations. Priority is
calculated by weighting fixations to a dimension more heavily to the extent they occurred earlier in a trial. The total
priority across dimensions sums to 1.

Results
We first set out to establish that this experiment replicated
the basic ordering of problem type difficulty found by
Shepard et al. (1961). The number of participants out of 18
that reached the learning criterion of four perfect blocks in a
row was 18, 18, 15, and 10 for problem Types I, II, IV, and
VI, respectively. For each participant we also computed the
number of blocks to criterion (for the Types IV and VI nonlearners we made the highly conservative assumption that
they would successfully solve the problem by block 29).

The average number of blocks to criterion was 7.11, 14.11,
18.11, and 22.94 for Types I, II, IV, and VI, respectively. A
one-way ANOVA demonstrated that these differences were
statistically reliable, F(3, 68) = 24.8, MSE = 32.5, p <.01;
all pairwise comparisons (I vs. II, II vs. IV, IV vs. VI) were
significant (p < .05). Finally, the total number of errors
committed for the four problems types was 8.17, 31.17,
36.89, and 70.56; F(3, 68) = 23.4, MSE = 510.9, p <.01
(all pairwise comparisons p < .05, except the Type II vs. IV
contrast, p < .15). Thus, this experiment indeed replicated
the basic problem type ordering: Type I < II < IV < VI.
One primary goal of this study, and a first for the categorization field, was to determine if selective attention can be
measured directly from eye movements. Figure 3 presents
the average number of dimensions fixated for learners only
in each category structure in each block. For participants
who reached criterion before the 28th block, we assumed
their eye movement data for the remaining blocks would
have been identical to their last actual four blocks.
Figure 3 illustrates that learners in this experiment indeed
allocated their attention (as measured by eye movements) to
only those stimulus dimensions needed to solve the classification problem. By the end of learning, the Type I group
was examining ~1 stimulus dimension; only 1 of the 18
Type I participants was not restricting his or her eye movements to the one relevant dimension. Similarly, the Type II
group was attending to ~2 stimulus dimensions; only 2 of
the 18 Type II participants were examining all three dimensions. Finally, as expected all Type IV and VI participants
were fixating ~3 dimensions. These results provide direct
evidence that the acquisition of categories involves selective
attention to only those dimensions needed for judging category membership.
A second goal of the present study concerns the process
by which participants reached their final pattern of selective
attention. We considered two possibilities. The first, based
on ALCOVE, was that attention would shift gradually to the
relevant dimensions. The second, based on RULEX, was
that attention would first be allocated to a single dimension
(as simple 1D rules were being tested) and then shift to include more dimensions as needed. As Figure 3 indicates, the
average group data clearly supports an ALCOVE-like gradual

978

To answer this question we examined the pattern of eye
movements for each of 18 participants assigned the Type I
problem. The Type I problem is ideal for this purpose because it is associated with the greatest reduction in the number of dimensions fixated, and hence the greatest change in
selective attention, during the course of learning. Although
at a detailed level there was of course a great deal of variety
across subjects, we found that the pattern of eye movements
of 15 of the 18 participants were qualitatively similar. This
pattern is exemplified by the eyetracking data of the one
Type I participant shown in Figure 4a-c.
Figure 4a presents the number of dimensions examined by
this participant in each of the participant’s 56 trials. As
Figure 4a indicates, in the first 21 trials this participant
typically fixated on all three dimensions (s/he fixated on 2
dimensions on 6 trials, and on 1 dimension on 1 trial).
However, starting on trial 22, and continuing for the rest of
the experimental session, only one stimulus dimension was
fixated. Note that rather than the gradual shift of attention
from ~2.5 dimensions to ~1 dimension suggested by the
Type I group data shown in Figure 3, this participant exhibits a sudden shift of attention to a single dimension. (The
fitted lines shown superimposed on the data in Figures 4a-d
are explained below.)
Figure 4b presents the proportion of time the participant
fixated on the one relevant dimension. A trial in which all
three dimensions are examined an equal amount of time results in a proportion time score of 0.33; one in which only
the relevant dimension is examined results in a score of
1.00. The figure indicates that in the first 21 trials the participant did not spend appreciably more time fixating the
relevant dimension than the other two dimensions. Starting
with trial 22 however, only the relevant dimension was fixated. This data confirms that the single dimension fixated
beginning with trial 22 (Figure 4a) was indeed the relevant
one (i.e., the one needed to respond correctly).
Finally, Figure 4c presents the relative priority of the
relevant dimension. A trial in which the three dimensions
were examined in random order would produce a priority
score of 0.33, and this score increases as the participant
tends to fixate relevant dimensions before the other dimensions. Figure 4c indicates that until trial 21, the participant
showed virtually no preference for looking at the relevant
dimension first. After trial 21, the relative priority score
becomes 1.00, a result entailed by the fact that starting with
that trial only the relevant dimension is fixated.
Taken together, Figures 4a-c suggest that this participant
exhibits none of the signs of gradual learning suggested by
the Type I group data. Up until trial 21, the participant typically examines all three dimensions, spends about as much
time examining the relevant dimension as the irrelevant
ones, and shows no preference for looking at the relevant
one first. Starting with trial 22 and continuing until the
learning criterion is reached on trial 56, only the relevant
dimension is fixated. The “suddenness” of learning suggested

To characterize the changes that took place in the pattern
of eye movements quantitatively, we fit sigmoid functions
to the results shown in Figure 4. Specifically, we fit the
following sigmoid function to the participant’s four dependent variables,
y = initial + diff / (1 + exp (–(mt + b)))
where y is the dependent variable being fit, initial is the
initial asymptote of the sigmoid, diff is the magnitude of the
change of the sigmoid from its initial asymptote to its final
asymptote, m is a measure of whether that change occurs
slowly or rapidly, b is the inflection point of the curve, and
t is trial number. (For the error fit, we set initial=0.50 and
diff=–0.50 reflecting initial guessing and eventual learning).
The results of these fits are shown superimposed on the
empirical data in Figure 4. For example, the parameters for
the fit to the number of dimensions fixated (Figure 4a) was
initial=2.65, diff=–1.65, m=10, and b=21.0. These parameter
estimates indicate that this subject began by fixating on
2.65 dimensions, ended up fixating 2.65–1.65=1 dimension,
the transition from 2.65 to 1 occurred rapidly (m=10), and
occurred at trial 21. The fits of the sigmoid functions in
Figures 4b-d also confirm the suddenness of the transition
on all three measures. Moreover, the value of the b parameter in all four fits confirms that the transitions occurred
within a trial or two of one another (b=21.0, 20.0, 21.0,
19.7 for number of dimensions, relevant fixation time, priority, and errors, respectively).
This fitting procedure was carried out for all 18 Type I
participants, and the parameter values for each of the four
fits averaged over participants are presented in Table 1. Consider first the fits for the number of dimensions fixated. The
averaged parameter values indicate that the average participant began by fixating 2.80 dimensions, ended fixating
2.80–1.63=1.17 dimensions, and made the transition at
about trial 13. Importantly, the average value of the m parameter (6.08) suggests that this transition from 2.80 to
1.17 dimensions occurred abruptly for most Type I subjects.

Figure 4
by these results is directly confirmed by the pattern of errors
(Figure 4d). Whereas during the first twenty trials the participant shows no indication of gradually reducing his/her
error rate (e.g., 5 errors committed in trials 1-10 followed by
7 in trials 11-20), errors cease entirely after trial 20.

To illustrate this result directly, we constructed “backward
learning curves” in which the curve fits for each participant
were aligned with one another by translating each participant’s trial number so that 0 corresponded to the value of the
b parameter, that is, the inflection point of the fitted sigmoid. These translated curves for each Type I participant are
shown in Figure 5. As expected given the average values of
the parameters shown in Table 1, Figure 5 indicates that
most Type I participants began by fixating between 2.5 and
3 dimensions, and all ended fixating the single relevant dimension. Moreover, for all but 3 of the participants, this
reduction in the number of dimensions took place within a
few trials. Figure 5 also shows the sigmoid produced by the
average parameter values shown in Table 1 for the number

of dimensions fixated. This curve, which represents the performance of the average Type I participant, shows that the
number of dimensions fixated undergoes a sudden decrease
from 2.6 to <1.2 dimensions in only two trials.
The three exceptions to the general pattern in Figure 5
have been labeled according to the alternative category learning strategy that these participants apparently used. First,
the one-dimensional rule tester looked at just one dimension
the entire session. We speculate that this person systematically tested one-dimensional rules until the correct one was
found. Second, the ALCOVE participant exhibited the gradual shift of attention toward the irrelevant dimensions and
toward the relevant one predicted by ALCOVE. Finally the
memorizer fixated all three dimensions the entire session.
We speculate that this person systematically memorized the
category membership of all eight stimuli.
The curve fits produced by the average parameter values in
Table 1 for all four dependent measures were computed, and
are presented in Figure 6. Figure 6 characterizes how performance according to all four measures changes as a function of trial for the average Type I participant. The figure
illustrates how the four effects all occur within a few trials
of one another. Before the critical learning point, the
learner’s chance of making an error is close to 50%, the
number of dimensions fixated is close to three, the proportion of time spent fixating the relevant dimension is less
than one-third, and the relevant dimensions is no more likely
to be fixated before the other dimensions. After the critical
learning point, errors have largely ceased, the average number of dimensions fixated is less that 1.5, the proportion of
time spent on the relevant dimension is over 90%, and the
relevant dimension is fixated early in the trial.

General Discussion
Since Shepard et al.’s (1961) seminal study a core assumption of virtually all theories of categorization has been that
category learning involves learning to attend to those stimulus dimensions that are useful for discriminating between
categories. However, evidence for this claim has consisted of
demonstrations that dimensions vary in their influence on
explicit categorization (and similarity) judgments, not the
operation of selective attention per se. To our knowledge,
the current results provide the first direct evidence for the

operation of selective attention in category learning.
Our findings provide strong support for the basic claim
that categorizers learn to allocate their attention in a way
that optimizes their classification performance. Of the 18
Type I participants, only one had failed to reduce the number
of dimension they fixated to the single relevant dimension
by the end of the experimental session. Similarly, by the
end of the session all but two of the 18 Type II participants
were fixating almost exclusively on the two dimensions
relevant to that category structure. That is, learners apparently confine their attention to those aspects of stimuli
needed to succeed at the classification task at hand.
Since Shepard et al. (1961), an important development in
categorization theory has been the development of computational models that formalize the mechanisms by which selective attention changes as a result of experience classifying
exemplars. One prominent example is the ALCOVE
connectionist learning model that predicts that attention
weights gradually shift in the direction of better performance
as learning experiences accumulate. In contrast to the gradual
change of attention suggested by ALCOVE however, our
eyetracking data indicated that the shift of attention to the
relevant dimension in the Type I problem occurred very
abruptly, in only a trial or two. Before that transition, most
Type I subjects showed no preference for looking at the relevant dimension any more than, or any earlier than, the other
dimensions.
Of course, the possibility exists that most Type I participants were gradually assigning more weight to the relevant
dimension in their explicit categorization decisions (as
ALCOVE predicts), but that this change was not reflected in
eye movements. However, this interpretation is undermined
by the fact that most participants’ error rates also showed no
improvement until what we have characterized as a critical
learning event occurred. That is, participants’ explicit categorization behavior and their eye movements were well
matched to one another: Before the critical learning event,
eye movements showed no preference for the relevant dimension, and error rates were about 50%. After it, eye movements showed exclusive preference for the relevant dimension, and errors ceased. Given this apparent “all-or-none”
learning, we follow Bower and Trabasso (1963) and Nosofsky et al. (1994) and suggest that results taken as support

for gradual learning may often be an artifact that results from
averaging over participants.
On the one hand, the all-or-none learning we found for
Type I problems is more consistent with a rule-based model
such as RULEX than ALCOVE. However, our results present problems for RULEX as well. Although RULEX predicts all-or-none learning for Type I problems, it also predicts that learners will initially consider single-dimension
rules as possible hypotheses regarding what defines category
membership. Instead, we found that on most trials almost
all Type I participants fixated on all three dimensions up
until learning occurred.
Once again, it is conceivable that participants were in fact
testing single dimension rules (as RULEX predicts), and that
the additional two or three dimension fixated were extraneous, that is, did not involve acquiring information that was
useful for the learning process. However, this suggestion is
incompatible with an overall view of category learners as
optimal allocators of attention. In the forty years since
Shepard et al. (1961), theorists have assumed, and the present experiment has confirmed, that categorizers largely allocate their attention to just those aspects of the stimulus they
believe are needed for successful classification. Analogously,
we suggest that learners largely allocate their attention to
just those aspects of stimuli they believe will be needed for
successful learning. That is, rather than assuming that our
Type I learners were committing extraneous eye fixations,
we argue that it is more likely that they thought they could
make use of the information on that which they fixated, and
that it is incumbent on categorization theorists to account
for why they sought out the sources of information that they
did. On these grounds, we conclude that models like RULEX
that assume that learners start off by (only) testing singledimension rules cannot be considered complete accounts of
participants’ learning strategies.
If our Type I learners were not involved in ALCOVE-like
gradual learning, or the testing of single-dimension rules,
what were they doing? One possibility is that they were
testing multi-dimension rules. Another is that they began by
trying to memorize the individual exemplars, but then “noticed” (somehow) that one dimension covaried consistent
with the category label. This noticing could be based on
comparing the current exemplar with the single previous
exemplar stored in working memory (Anderson, Kline, &
Beasley, 1979), or with multiple examples stored in longterm memory (Ross, Perkins, & Tenpenny 1990). Examining all stimulus dimensions is also consistent with the
growing trend toward considering category learning as involving multiple learning processes. For example, according
to Kruschke (2001), acquiring categories may involve learning which of possibly several learning “experts” (e.g. a 1D
rule-based learning module and exemplar learning) is producing the best performance. Examining all stimulus features
allows as many experts as possible to be involved in the
learning process. Finally, we note that because real-world
category learning often involves categories with meaningful
rather than meaningless stimulus dimensions, our participants may have been looking to find (or construct) meaningful relationships between category features.
To answer these and other questions we are continuing our

981

analyses of the rich set of eyetracking data produced for the
Type I category structure, the other three Shepard structures,
and yet other learning problems. Still, we believe even the
initial results reported here establish the usefulness of
eyetracking to measure selective attention in category learning. After several decades of building categorization theories
on the basis of binary choice data alone, we believe that the
field of categorization is ready for the introduction of more
sophisticated measures. We expect that use of a headmounted eyetracker will provide the field with a rich source
of empirical data that will help discriminate among existing
models and help advance cognitive theory in this area.
