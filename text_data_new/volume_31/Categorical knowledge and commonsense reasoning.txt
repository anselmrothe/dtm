argument can also be perceived as strong. Sloman (1993)
nicely formalized this idea in equation 1:

Abstract
This article examines how categorical knowledge influences
commonsense reasoning. In one behavioral experiment,
participants judged the likelihood of unrelated conclusions
when corresponding premises were given in categorical,
descriptive, or non-generic statements. The results showed
that participants were more likely to endorse the unrelated
conclusions when premises were given in the categorical
statements, suggesting that generic noun phrases tend to
promote explanation-like inferential reasoning.

model, the similarity between concepts is defined by
equation (2).

Consider the following sentences.

sim( P1 , C ) 

Why does John love football so much?
Because he is an American.
Why does Fred lie so often?
Because he is a lawyer.

F ( P1 )  F (C )
--- (2)
| F ( P1 ) || F (C ) |

Substituting (2) into (1) will yield

If you know a little about what it means to be an
“American” or “lawyer,” it wouldn’t be difficult to
understand some humor underneath these sentences. We
can’t help chuckling because we have shared categorical
knowledge about an “American” or “lawyer.” Most of our
everyday reasoning involves simple applications of
commonsense like these.
What cognitive process mediates commonsense reasoning
similar to those shown above? One approach can be
integrating “similarity” into a subsumption-based algorithm.
For example, in Argument 1 below, the strength of the
conclusion can be measured by two factors: (1) the
similarity between two concepts –American and football –
along with (2) the coverage of the premise concept –
American – over the conclusion concept – football:
Argument 1:
(Premise) John is an American.
(Conclusion) John loves football.
In this case, the concepts, American and football, are
represented by n dimensional feature vectors;
American=[ a1 , a2 ..., an ]T and Football=[ b1 , b2 ..., bn ]T,
where individual elements of the dimensions correspond to
some values associated with each feature. If the two vectors
are sufficiently similar, then the argument described above
is perceived as strong. If the premise concept, American, is
more inclusive than the conclusion concept, Football, the

F ( P1 )  F (C )

| F ( P1 ) | [ F ( P1 )  F (C )] | F ( P1 ) |

sim( P1 , C )
| F ( P1 ) || F (C ) || F (C ) |
| F (C ) |

As equation 3 shows, the Sloman model delineates that the
strength of inductive arguments come from (a) the similarity
between concepts in a premise (American) and conclusion
(football), and (b) the degree of coverage of a premise
concept (American) over a conclusion concept (football).
A variant of similarity-based reasoning algorithms have
been shown to account for a wide range of human
reasoning, including legal judgment (Rissland, 2006),
categorization (Love et al., 2005), and inference (Yamauchi
& Markman, 1998, 2000).
Is this similarity-based account sufficient to explain
commonsense reasoning? The similarity-based approach
assumes that concepts, such as American or football, consist
of a set of features, and reasoning operates over concepts
that exist prior to the operation. Categorical knowledge
specifies relationships among instances and properties, but it
may also help create new properties. For example, a
categorical statement such as “Jane is a feminist” not only
activates our general pre-existing knowledge about
“feminist,” but it also leads us to seek some properties to

1870

explain away a behavior of Jane (Wisniewski & Medin,
1994; Yamauchi, 2005). In other words, categorical
statements not only conjure up the common properties
shared by its members, but also create, generate, and
rationalize new properties that are not present.
In this article I will examine the role of generic sentences
– a syntactic property that characterizes kinds of objects –
in commonsense reasoning, and examine the idea that
generic sentences help justification and rationalization.

Generic Sentences and Categorical Reasoning
Compare sentences 1a-3a with 1b-3b.
(1a) Dogs bark.
(2a) A bird can fly.
(3a) The French love wine.
(1b) Dogs were barking.
(2b) A bird is flying.
(3b) The French bought wine.
These sentences use the same noun labels, dogs, a bird, and
the French, but the implications of these noun labels are
drastically different. Sentences (1a)-(3a) characterize dogs,
a bird, and the French categorically as an abstract whole,
while (1b)-(3b) treat the same nouns, dogs, a bird and the
French as specific instances of the categories. For example,
while (1a) describes the general characteristic of dogs as a
kind, (1b) tells us an episode about particular dogs.
Sentences like (1a)-(3a) are called generic noun phrases and
convey information about a category as a whole, rather than
properties associated with particular instances in the
category (Carlson & Pelletier, 1995; Prasada, 2000). My
conjecture in this article is that an explanation-like
reasoning strategy is promoted when categorical
information is given in a generic sentence.
The following sentences help illustrate the
manipulations introduced in our experiment:
(4) “KOMITA” is a birthday gift.
(5) Many people give “KOMITA” to their friends and
relatives for their birthdays.
(6) “KOMITA” is the birthday gift that John bought for
his wife this year.
The three sentences characterize an unknown item,
“KOMITA,” in different manners. (4) is a typical generic
sentence. This sentence links “KOMITA” to a category as
an abstract whole. (5) refers to “KOMITA” in terms of a
general episode associated with the item. The idea of
“KOMITA is a birthday gift” can be inferred directly from
(5), but no explicit reference to a category is made in this
sentence. Sentence (6) employs a category inclusion
statement in a similar manner described in (4), but this is not
a generic sentence. “KOMITA” is modified with a definite
article “the” along with an adjective clause. “KOMITA” in

(6) refers to a specific instance, not a category, of
“KOMITA” as a whole (Carlson & Pelletier, 1995).
Now consider a reasoning task in which subjects judge
the likelihood of a conclusion – (7) “KOMITA” sell well in
mid-size cities – with respect to these three types of
premises (4) – (6). Applying the similarity-coverage
algorithm (equation 3), it is not difficult to see that a
categorical statement such as (4) bolsters the estimation of
highly likely attributes (e.g., “’KOMITA’ costs about $30”)
(Gelman & Heyman, 1999; Yamauchi, 2005). The question
addressed in the next experiment pertained to the reasoning
about the attributes that have nothing to do with the
category.
In the experiment, the conclusion attributes had no
obvious connection with the premise categories. So, the
only way to support the irrelevant conclusion, such as
“’KOMITA’ sells well in mid-size cities,” is to make up
justifications. In the next experiment, I will show that
premises given in categorical statements systematically
bolster the estimation of unrelated features, even when
similarity and coverage factors are controlled in three
conditions – categorical, descriptive, and non-generic
conditions (between-subjects conditions).

Experiment
The materials were 15 descriptions of arbitrary items,
which were specified by a combination of three consonantvowel pairs (e.g., “KOMITA”, and see Appendix). Each
item is associated with one of 15 categories that represented
objects, activities, and locations. From these 15 categories,
three types of descriptions were created. In the categorical
condition, an unknown item (e.g., “KOMITA”) was
characterized generically with categorical statements. In the
descriptive condition, the same item was characterized
descriptively without category labels. In the non-generic
condition, an unknown item was characterized with a
category inclusion statement, but it was also modified by a
definite article “the” and an adjective clause.
Categorical condition
Premise:
“KOMITA” is a birthday gift. It is particularly popular
among young couples.
Conclusion:
A. KOMITA sells well during the summer.
B. Many lawyers own KOMITA.
C (probe). Many people give “KOMITA” to their
friends and relatives for their birthdays.
Descriptive condition
Premise:
Many people give “KOMITA” to their friends and
relatives for their birthdays. It is particularly popular
among young couples.
Conclusion:
A. KOMITA sells well during the summer.

The task of the participants was to estimate the likelihood

15. Healthy exercise
A. MINAMI requires expensive equipment.
B. People who exercise MINAMI also like traveling

The following subsection describes the procedure employed
to control similarity and coverage factors shown in equation
3.

Controlling Similarity and Coverage Factors
To control the similarity and coverage factors, one probe
question was inserted at the end of each stimulus. The probe
questions given in the descriptive condition were the
categorical statements given in the categorical condition.
The probe questions given in the categorical condition were
the descriptive statements given in the descriptive condition.
Thus, the stimuli had the following structure:
I. Categorical condition
P1: “KOMITA” is a birthday gift.
Conclusion (unlikely attribute): Many lawyers own
KOMITA.
Probe Question: Many people give “KOMITA” to their
friends and relatives for their birthdays.
II. Descriptive condition
P1’: Many people give “KOMITA” to their friends and
relatives for their birthdays.
Conclusion (unlikely attribute): Many lawyers own
KOMITA.
Probe Question: KOMITA is a birthday gift.
III. Non-generic condition
P1’: “KOMITA” is the birthday gift that John bought
for his wife this year..
Conclusion (unlikely attribute): Many lawyers own
KOMITA.
Probe Question: KOMITA is a birthday gift
These probe questions were employed to equate the
coverage of two types of premises – categorical statements
and descriptive statements. Consider equations (4) and (5)
below.

1872

a x ( P1 ' | P1 ) 

| F ( P1 ) |
sim( P1 , P1 ' )  1

pairs (e.g., “KOMITA”). The arbitrary items were
characterized by categorical statements, descriptive
statements or non-generic statements (see Appendix). Each
item description was accompanied by 2 unlikely attributes
and one probe question.

--- (4)

Let us assume that equation (4) represents a case in which
a participant endorses probe question P1‘ (i.e., a descriptive
statement) given premise P1 (i.e., a categorical statement)
with a score of 100, whereas equation (5) represents a case
in which a participant endorses probe question P1 (i.e., a
categorical statement) given premise P1‘ (i.e., a descriptive
statement) with a score of 100. By combining (4) and (5),
we will get (6).

a x ( P1 | P1 ' )  a x ( P'1 | P1 )

| F ( P1 ' ) |
| F ( P1 ) |
sim( P1 ' , P1 ) 
sim( P1 , P'1 )
| F ( P1 ) |
| F ( P'1 ) |
Because sim( P1 ' , P1 ) = sim( P1 , P '1 ) (equation (2)),
equation (6) can be reduced to equation (7).

| F ( P1 ' ) |
| F ( P1 ) |

| F ( P1 ) |
| F ( P1 ' ) |
| F ( P1 ' ) || F ( P1 ) |

--- (7)

Procedure The task of the participants was to estimate the
likelihood of the conclusion attributes given that premise
statements were true. Each stimulus was shown on a
computer screen and the order of presenting the stimuli was
determined randomly for each participant. All participants
estimated the same conclusion attributes, and participants
indicated their responses using a 0-100 scale.
Design The experiment had one factor with three betweensubjects levels (premise statement; categorical, descriptive,
and non-generic). The scores obtained from two attribute
questions were combined and analyzed together. To ensure
that the impact of the categorical statements and the
descriptive statements were equivalent in equation 1, the
data were analyzed for the participants who made a score of
100 to each probe question. This procedure assures that all
of the descriptive statements were endorsed with a score of
100 in the categorical and non-generic conditions, and all of
the categorical statements were endorsed with a score of 100
in the descriptive condition. This effectively balanced the
contributions of the two components, (a) similarity and (b)
coverage, in equation 3 in the categorical and descriptive
conditions.

Results

Thus, according to Sloman’s feature-based model, if
participants endorse the two types of probe questions with
an equal score (e.g., 100), then the perceived coverage of
two premises can be treated as equivalent. The question is
whether or not the unrelated attributes would be judged
more likely in the category condition even when the
similarity-coverage factors are controlled.
Because unlikely attributes had no direct association with
the categories stated in the premises, we reasoned that the
only way to support the irrelevant conclusion is to make up
some inferential justifications. Consequently, unlikely
attributes should be judged more likely in the categorical
condition if, as hypothesized, generic noun phrases enhance
explanation-like inferential reasoning.

Method
Participants Participants were 317 undergraduate students
who participated in this experiment for course credit. They
were randomly assigned to one of three conditions – a
categorical (N=104), descriptive (N=110), or non-generic
condition (N=103).
Materials
The materials were 15 descriptions of arbitrary items, which
were specified by a combination of three consonant-vowel

To eliminate outliers, all estimation scores that deviated 2
standard deviation units from the mean of each experimental
condition were removed from the data analysis. This
procedure resulted in 4650 data points (97.8% of the
original data points). To ensure that the categorical
statements and the descriptive statements were equivalent in
their truth values, the data were analyzed for the participants
who made a score of 100 to each probe question. This
procedure assures that all of the descriptive statements were
endorsed with a score of 100 in the categorical and nongeneric conditions, and all of the categorical statements
were endorsed with a score of 100 in the descriptive
condition (categorical condition, N=89; descriptive
condition, N=98, and non-generic condition, N=81).
To test the generality of the results, a minimum value of
quasi F-ratio (min-F’) was calculated from a subject-based
F-value and an item-based F-value (Clark, 1973). This
measure examines whether or not the effect obtained from
the three conditions can be generalized to different items
and different participants simultaneously.
Overall, estimation scores obtained in the three
conditions differed significantly; F(2, 267)=7.44,
MSE=260.3, p<.01; min-F’(2, 235)=6.36, MSE=51.1, p<.01
(Table 1). The average estimation score in the categorical
condition was higher than that in the non-generic condition;
min-F’(1, 163)=12.1, MSE=86.8, p<.01. The estimation

1873

score observed in the categorical condition was also higher
than that in the descriptive condition; min-F’(1, 162)=6.3,
MSE=40.3, p<.05. The performance in the descriptive
condition were not statistically different from that in the
non-generic condition; min-F’(1, 177)<1.0. This result
suggests that participants in the categorical condition were
far more likely to endorse unlikely attributes as compared to
participants in the descriptive condition and in the nongeneric condition even though they fully endorse
corresponding descriptive statements and categorical
statements perfectly.

Discussion
Commonsense reasoning is indispensable for everyday
reasoning as well as legal, medical and scientific reasoning
(Breuker et al., 2004; Brewka, 1991; Elio, 2002). To explain
inductive reasoning, a number of researchers have proposed
similarity-based algorithms (Doan et al., 2004; Rissland
2006). In cognitive psychology, similarity-based models
have also been successful in accounting for induction,
categorization, and memory retrieval (Love et al., 2004;
Osherson et al., 1990; Heit, 2000; Hintzman, 1986; Sloman,
1993; Sloutsky, 2003). The present experiment suggests that
the similarity-based approach can be extended and improved
by introducing an algorithm incorporates “explanation.”
The idea that explanation is an important factor in
generalization has attracted recent studies (Sloman, 1994;
Keil, 2006; Yamauchi, 2005). In AI research, Torroni, et al.
(2007) and Tempich, and colleagues (Tempich et al., 2007)
offer a promising framework. They place argumentation
technologies at the center stage of nonmonotonic reasoning
and knowledge engineering. A similar approach is also
suggested by Steels (2006), where the formation of new
concepts is taken as an adaptive and interactive process in
which agents (including humans) incessantly engage in
“representation-making” through negotiation, justification,
and explanation.
The current study shows a possible link between
explanation-like inferential reasoning and categorical
statements. It appears worthwhile to investigate further
explanation-based reasoning as a major tool to explore
human commonsense reasoning.

Table 1. A summary of the results from Experiment. These
numbers represent average estimation scores obtained over
individual participants in each condition.

There were different numbers of words in the
premise statements in the three conditions (categorical
condition, M=16.5; descriptive condition, M=19.5; nongeneric condition, M=22.1). This might have contributed to
the observed differences between the three conditions. To
rule out this explanation, item-based ANCOVAs (analysis
of covariance) were performed by treating the number of
words in stimuli as covariate. This analysis shows that the
mean estimation score from the category condition was
higher than those from the other two conditions; F(2,
41)=4.48, MSE=58.70, p<.01; categorical condition vs.
descriptive condition; F(1, 27)=4.40, MSE=66.04, p<.05;
categorical condition vs. non-generic condition; F(1,
27)=6.64, MSE=58.94, p<.05. The difference between the
descriptive condition and the non-generic condition was not
significant; F(1, 27)=1.31, MSE=52.60, p=.26. Clearly,
categorical statements, when stated in generic sentences,
elevate the estimation of unlikely conclusions.
