that 4-year-olds, but not 5-year-olds, have difficulty
remembering object locations relative to object
configurations (Nardini, Burgess, Breckinridge, &
Atkinson, 2006). Here, we suggest that these results are
linked and test whether 4-year-olds show a binding-specific
deficit consistent with their inability to anchor features to
object configurations. Thus, 4-year-olds might remember
that a duck, ball, and car were present in a scene and,
further, that the objects were red, blue, and yellow, but not
remember that the duck was blue, the ball was red, and the
car was yellow.

Abstract
Remembering object identities requires ‘binding’ visual
features together in working memory to form integrated
object representations. Research with adults suggests that
such feature binding is achieved through space: features at a
given spatial location are ‘bound’ to create integrated objects
that are anchored to a spatial map of the object layout.
Critically, 4-year-old children do not form such spatial maps,
whereas 5-year-old children do. This suggests that 4-yearolds might have difficulty binding features together in visual
working memory. We tested 4- and 5-year-old children and
adults in a change detection task, and found that 4-year-olds
showed a binding-specific deficit. Thus, the ability to
represent integrated objects in visual working memory is a
relatively late developmental achievement. We suggest that
before 5 years of age children’s object representations are
primarily mediated through visual long-term memory.

Feature Binding in Visual Working Memory
The past decade has seen considerable debate in the VWM
literature over whether feature binding presents a problem in
vision (for reviews, see Luck & Beach, 1998; Roskies,
1999; Treisman, 1996). Evidence suggests that object
properties such as color, form, and size are coded in a
distributed manner across different neural populations in the
ventral pathway (Tootell, Dale, Sereno, & Malach, 1998).
As information passes through this pathway, there is an
increase in the complexity of the features coded (Desimone,
Albright, Gross, & Bruce, 1984) and receptive field sizes,
with a decrease in the spatial resolution of receptive fields
for individual neurons (Gross, Rocha-Miranda, & Bender,
1972). Consequently, when multiple objects are present in a
scene, it may be difficult to determine which features belong
together as VWM representations. Consistent with this,
adults sometimes report illusory conjunctions, correctly
reporting that a target feature was present but mis-binding
that feature with the color of a nearby distracter (Ashby,
Prinzmetal, Ivry, & Maddox, 1996).1
Although the debate over the binding “problem” is far
from resolved (e.g., Garson, 2001), several behavioral
studies with adults have shown that feature binding can
present a challenge in working memory tasks (Allen et al.,
2006; J.S. Johnson, Hollingworth, & Luck, 2008; Wheeler
& Treisman, 2002). Several theories suggest that features
may be bound by integrating spatial and non-spatial visual
features (J.S. Johnson, Spencer, & Schöner, 2008).
According to feature integration theory (Treisman &
Gelade, 1980), for instance, object features are bound

Visual Working Memory
Human adults can quickly form a mental map of which
objects are where in a local workspace. Adults form
working memory representations of 3-4 objects in a few
hundred milliseconds with enough detail to detect changes
in those objects a second later, even when the objects are
composed of multiple simple features such as color,
orientation, and size (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997). Moreover,
given just 20 seconds to scan the surrounds, adults can
detect a subtle change in the features of an object in a scene
as much as 24 hours later after viewing more than 400
objects (Hollingworth, 2005). There are, of course,
limitations to humans’ visuo-spatial abilities (e.g., Pashler,
1992; Rensink, 2000), but these examples highlight the fast,
flexible visual working memory (VWM) system that
underlies adults’ interactions with objects.
The present report examines the developmental origin of
this ability. Can young children quickly form
representations of which objects are where with sufficient
detail to detect changes in those objects a second later? This
may not be the case. As we review below, research suggests
that visual features such as shape and color are ‘bound’ in
working memory by virtue of their shared spatial location
within the configuration of objects in a scene (e.g.,
Hollingworth, 2007; J.S. Johnson, Spencer, & Schöner,
2008; Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Evidence further suggests

Although these studies did not use working memory
paradigms, it is plausible that the perceptual mis-binding of
features they show would affect working memory representations.

together by virtue of their shared spatial location as visual
selective attention shifts sequentially about the scene. Such
spatial information is represented in a second cortical
pathway, the dorsal pathway (Ungerleider & Mishkin,
1982), which maintains multiple spatial reference frames
including a frame anchored to the object configuration. This
spatial frame is central to object representations; for
example, adults show decrements detecting changes in
object features when object configurations are broken
(Hollingworth, 2007).

performed at above-chance levels when the object array
moved or both the child and the array moved during the
delay. This suggests that 3- and 4-year-olds do not encode
object locations relative to object configurations. If binding
in VWM requires anchoring features to their spatial position
in the object configuration as suggested by data with adults
(Hollingworth, 2007), children younger than 5 years might
have difficulty using space to bind features together in
VWM.

Development of Feature Binding

In the present study, we tested whether 4-year-olds, 5-yearolds, and adults could detect changes in object features in a
feature-binding versus multi-feature memory version of the
change detection paradigm (cf. Wheeler & Treisman, 2002).
In the feature-binding task, object features are swapped
between two objects on change trials. In Figure 1, for
instance, the cross and triangle swap positions in the ‘shape
change’ example, thereby breaking the color-shape binding
for these objects. This task was contrasted with a multifeature memory task where a new color or shape is
introduced on change trials. In Figure 1, for instance, the
triangle changes to an hourglass in the ‘shape change’
example. The multi-feature task requires memory for the
colors and shapes in the sample array; however, because a
new feature is introduced at test, memory for color-shape
bindings is not required.

Empirical Test of Predictions
Relatively little is known about how children bind object
features together in VWM and the developmental course of
this ability. The dorsal and ventral visual pathways appear
to be functional in infancy but may not be tightly integrated
(M.H. Johnson, Mareschal, & Csibra, 2001). Given that
VWM and visual long-term memory work hand-in-hand,
however, it is possible that young children can represent
integrated objects when there is support from visual longterm memory. This possibility has not been adequately
explored due to the challenges of isolating these two
memory systems. For instance, studies using habituation or
preferential looking paradigms suggest that infants can bind
visual features (M.H. Johnson et al., 2001; Mareschal &
Johnson, 2003; Oakes, Ross-Sheehy, & Luck, 2006).
Nevertheless, because infants’ visual preferences in such
tasks emerge over 10 to 20 second trials, these paradigms
likely recruit visual long-term memory and, therefore, do
not specify whether features can be bound when VWM must
work in isolation (Simmering & Spencer, 2009).
The quality of children’s object representations in VWM
might also be difficult to assess given the stability of the
physical world—even though children might not remember
the exact features of an object, they can typically look back
to the location of the remembered object to refresh this
information. To accomplish this, they need only ‘bind’ a
single feature to the correct location. To refresh a memory
of a blue circle, for example, one need only remember
where the blue object was, look back to that location, and
recover the relevant shape information. Critically, this
would only refresh the currently fixated item; it would not
help with the integration of information across visual
samples. Interestingly, 4-year-olds have difficulty in tasks
that require this type of integration, such as block
construction and drawing tasks where they must scan back
and forth between a complex design and a nearby
workspace to duplicate the design (Georgopoulos,
Georgopoulos, Kuz, & Landau, 2004). Thus, 4-year-olds
have difficulty integrating information across visual
samples, suggesting they might have limited VWM abilities.
Four-year-olds also have difficulty remembering object
locations relative to an object configuration, whereas 5year-olds are more proficient. Nardini and colleagues (2006)
tested 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-year-old children’s location memory
abilities when either the object array or the child moved
during the delay. Critically, only 5- and 6-year-olds

Results show that adults perform comparably well in both
tasks (e.g., J.S. Johnson, Hollingworth, & Luck, 2008;
Wheeler & Treisman, 2002), providing an ideal starting
point for a developmental examination of feature binding:
we know adults do not show a binding deficit in this task;
the question is, do children?2 Because 4-year-olds have
difficulty in tasks that require remembering object locations
relative to the object configuration and integrating

One study used a variant of the change detection task to
examine whether children bind visual features to locations. Results
showed that 8- to 11-year-olds had difficulty binding colors to
locations (Cowan, Naveh-Benjamin, Kilb, & Saults, 2006).
Critically, college-aged adults also had difficulty in this condition,
which is not consistent with other results (e.g., J.S. Johnson,
Hollingworth, & Luck, 2008). This might reflect the use of a nonstandard task that required the detection of feature repetitions.

to show binding-specific deficits in VWM. Such a deficit
would suggest that integrated object representations in
VWM are a developmental achievement that occurs
surprisingly late in childhood.

than 7 years do not spontaneously verbally recode or
rehearse visual stimuli (Pickering, 2001).
Each session began with a block of eight practice trials,
four each (two change, two no change) in SS2 and SS3,
presented in random order; excluding SS1 trials from the
practice block facilitated the experimenter’s evaluation of
whether children understood the task. After the practice
block, the test trials were blocked by SS and presented in
the following order: SS2-SS1-SS3. Based on pilot data and
previous studies (Simmering & Spencer, 2009), this order
elicited the best performance from children, avoiding
boredom and frustration. Children were offered breaks
between blocks to prevent fatigue. Each test block included
six change and six no change trials, presented in random
order. For all no change trials, the sample and test arrays
were identical. For SS1 change trials, binding changes were
not possible; instead, for both conditions, the item changed
in either color or shape (half of the trials each). For SS2-3
change trials in the Multi-Feature Memory condition, this
same type of change occurred for one item in the test array.
In the Feature Binding condition, however, two items would
swap color-shape pairings. On half of the change trials, two
colors swapped locations; on the other half, two shapes
swapped locations (see Figure 1).

Method
Participants Participants were 28 four-year-olds (M age =
4.19 years, SD = 1.89 months; 15 females), 28 five-yearolds (M age = 5.08 years, SD = 1.75 months; 11 females),
and 28 adults (M age = 19.69 years, SD = 11.84 months; 9
females) who were randomly assigned across conditions.
Nine additional participants were excluded for the following
reasons: failure to understand the task (2 four-year-olds);
equipment failure (1 four-year-old, 2 five-year-olds);
experimenter error (1 four-year-old, 3 five-year-olds).
Children were recruited from a university database and
given small prizes for participating; adults volunteered or
were recruited through a psychology course for research
exposure credit. Informed consent was obtained from adult
participants and parents of child participants. All
participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision
and no colorblindness.
Apparatus and Procedure Complete details of the
apparatus and procedure are described by Simmering &
Spencer (2009). The task was presented on an 18” CRT
monitor with a black background at a viewing distance of
approximately 60 cm. Stimuli were comprised of one of
eight possible shapes with one of eight possible colors (cf.
Wheeler & Treisman, 2002); note that no color or shape was
repeated within a given array. Trials included 1, 2, or 3 item
arrays (set sizes [SS] 1-3) because 4- to 5-year-old children
have a VWM capacity of approximately 2-3 items in change
detection (Simmering & Spencer, 2009); testing array sizes
within children’s memory capacity ensured that their
performance was not generally impaired by task difficulty.
Each trial began with the memory array, presented for 2 s
(extended from the typically duration of 500 ms to be
appropriate for children), followed by a 900 ms delay. Next,
the test array was displayed until the participant responded
same or different (the terms match and no match were used
for children). Children responded verbally, and an
experimenter entered the response on a keyboard; adult
participants entered their responses directly on the
keyboard. To keep child participants motivated, a chime
played for each correct response; note that this feedback was
also provided to adult participants.3 For adults, a verbal load
was added to prevent verbal recoding and/or rehearsal: a 3digit number appeared on the computer screen before each
block, and adults repeated this number throughout the trials.
This was included only for adults because children younger

Results
Responses were tabulated separately for change and no
change test trials to arrive at percent correct scores for each
participant, trial type, and SS. Mean percent correct data,
shown in Table 1, were analyzed separately by trial type and
set size (SS1 separately from SS2-3) because no change and
all SS1 trials were identical across conditions (recall that
binding changes are not possible with one item). Thus, we
expected differences across conditions only on multi-item
(SS2-3) change trials.
Results for SS2-3 change trials are shown in Figure 2A. A
three-way ANOVA with Set Size (2, 3) as a within-subjects
factor and Age (4 years, 5 years, adults) and Condition
(Multi-Feature Memory, Feature Binding) as betweensubjects factors revealed significant main effects of Set Size
(F1, 78 = 7.47, p < .01), Age (F2, 78 = 22.18, p < .001), and
Condition (F1, 78 = 8.13, p < .01), as well as a significant
Age x Condition interaction (F2, 78 = 5.23, p < .01).
The Set Size main effect was driven by better
performance in SS2 (M = 74.84%) than in SS3 (M =
66.96%), which is consistent with previous findings that
performance decreases as set size increases (e.g., Luck &
Vogel, 1997). Follow-up Tukey HSD tests (p < .05) on the
Age main effect showed that adults (M = 85.48%)
performed better than both 4-year-olds (M = 61.16%) and 5year-olds (M = 66.07%), but the two groups of children did
not differ significantly. The Condition main effect was
driven by overall lower performance in the Feature Binding
condition (M = 66.41%; Multi-Feature Memory M =
75.40%), but this effect was qualified by the significant
interaction. Analyses of each Age group separately showed
that 4-year-olds performed significantly worse in the

Although this positive feedback seemed to improve children’s
motivation, the design of the current study precluded us from
testing whether children’s performance improved as a result of this
feedback. Specifically, the number of trials within each block was
too small for reasonable analysis within blocks, and set size was
confounded with order (see details in the following paragraph).

change trials (Figure 3A), consistent with our previous
results. When features were swapped between objects in the
Feature Binding condition, however, participants showed a
comparable proportion of misses for both types of feature
changes (Figure 3B). This resulted in a more than three-fold
increase in color-change errors for 4-year-olds in the
Feature Binding condition. This dramatic increase in errors,
specific to the task and type of change presented, is
consistent with ANOVA results suggesting that 4-year-olds
have a binding-specific deficit in VWM.

Feature Binding condition (F1, 26 = 14.48, p < .001), with no
significant differences across conditions for 5-year-olds or
adults (F1, 26 < 1.5, p > .2). In summary, on multi-item
change trials, adults performed well in both conditions,
consistent with previous studies. Although 5-year-olds
performed worse than adults overall, they had no specific
difficulty with the feature-binding task. By contrast, 4-yearolds showed significantly worse performance when binding
was required.

If 4-year-olds know that they need to look for changes but
have difficulty binding features together, then they should
have roughly equal difficulty when shapes versus colors are
swapped between objects (see Figure 1). By contrast, the
detection of new features at test in the Multi-Feature
Memory condition might be driven more by the salience of
the new feature, which could differ on shape-change versus
color-change trials (see Figure 1). For instance, previous
research using a single-feature memory task showed that
shape changes are more difficult to detect than color
changes (Simmering & Spencer, 2009).
To examine this issue, we computed the proportion of
misses for shape- versus color-change trials across
conditions for SS2-3 (Figure 3). When a new feature was
introduced in the Multi-Feature Memory condition,
participants missed the changes more frequently on shape-

Nevertheless, it is possible that 4-year-olds in the Feature
Binding condition did not understand the task. To evaluate
this, we analyzed performance on SS2-3 no change trials,
which were identical across conditions and randomly
intermixed with change trials; results are shown in Figure
2B. A three-way ANOVA with Set Size (2, 3) as a withinsubjects factor and Age and Condition as between-subjects
factors revealed only a significant main effect of Age (F2, 78
= 1.59, p < .001). Follow-up Tukey HSD tests (p < .05)
showed that adults (M = 96.72%) performed better than both
4-year-olds (M = 81.34%) and 5-year-olds (M = 84.82%),
but the two groups of children did not differ significantly.
Thus, all children could detect matching arrays that were
intermixed with change trials.
We also analyzed data from the SS1 trials, which were
identical across conditions, separately by trial type. We first

109

analyzed the SS1 change trials in a two-way ANOVA with
Age and Condition as between-subjects factors. Once again,
the ANOVA revealed only a significant main effect of Age
(F2, 78 = 4.76, p < .05). Follow-up Tukey HSD tests (p < .05)
showed that adults performed better than both 4- and 5-yearolds, but that the two groups of children did not differ
significantly (see Table 1 for means).
Next, we analyzed the SS1 no change trials with a twoway ANOVA. This analysis revealed a significant main
effect of Age (F2, 78 = 6.38, p <.01) and a significant Age x
Condition interaction (F2, 78 = 3.39, p < .05). Tests of simple
effects revealed significant main effects of Age in both the
Multi-Feature Memory (F2, 39 = 3.38, p < .05) and Feature
Binding conditions (F2, 39 = 5.54, p < .01). Follow-up Tukey
HSD tests (p < .05) showed different patterns across
conditions: in the Multi-Feature Memory condition, adults
performed significantly better than only 5-year-olds,
whereas adults performed significantly better than only 4year-olds in the Feature Binding condition (see Table 1 for
means). No other comparisons were significant. Critically,
additional tests of simple effects revealed no significant
Condition main effects for any of the age groups (p >
0.125), showing that, although 4-year-olds tended to be less
accurate than 5-year-olds and adults on SS1 no change
trials, there were no significant condition-related differences
in performance within age groups.
Even though follow-up tests showed no significant
condition effects for the 4-year-olds on SS1 trials, we
conducted one final analysis to assess whether 4-year-olds
in the Feature Binding condition might have had a general
response bias that could explain their binding deficit. We
computed response criterion bias on SS1 trials4 as follows
(Cowan et al., 2006):
β = -0.5 * [z(proportion hits) + z(proportion false alarms)].5
Response criterion bias is commonly used in signal
detection analyses to determine how likely participants were
to indicate a change when they are unsure whether a change
actually occurred, that is, whether they had a general bias to
respond change (Cowan et al., 2006). Scores range from
-2.33 to 2.33, with zero reflecting no bias (i.e., equal
numbers of change and no change responses), negative
scores indicating more change responses, and positive
scores indicating more no change responses. Mean bias
scores and standard deviations are shown in Table 2.
If young children in the Feature Binding condition had a
general bias to respond no change, this could explain their
lower performance on change trials with multi-item arrays.
If this were the case, response criteria adjustments that
participants made as a consequence of the type of changes

they saw in the first block of trials (i.e., new features in the
Multi-Feature Memory condition versus binding swaps in
the Feature Binding condition) should carry over to the SS1
trials (since these trials occurred in the middle of the
session; see Method). Such an effect would yield a
difference in response bias across conditions. A two-way
ANOVA with Age and Condition as between-subjects
factors revealed no significant effects (ps > .38). Thus, there
is no evidence that the deficit 4-year-olds show in the
Feature Binding condition was due to a general difference in
response criteria compared to the Multi-Feature Memory
condition. Rather, our analyses are consistent with the
conclusion that 4-year-olds show a binding-specific deficit
in VWM.

Conclusions
Evidence suggests that adults quickly bind visual features
into integrated object representations in VWM anchored to
the configuration of objects in the scene. Recent results
show that 4-year-olds have only a rudimentary ability to
remember locations anchored to an object configuration
(Nardini et al., 2006). Here, we suggested these results were
linked and hypothesized that 4-year-olds might show a
binding-specific deficit in VWM. This was indeed the
case—feature binding in VWM emerges between 4 and 5
years. These data contradict the commonly-held view that
feature binding in VWM is achieved in infancy (e.g., Oakes
et al., 2006). As discussed previously, the tasks used with
infants likely recruit long-term visual memory, which was
precluded here (Simmering & Spencer, 2009). Rather, our
data suggest that the ability to represent integrated objects in
VWM, without support from visual long-term memory, is a
relatively late developmental achievement.
What are the consequences for young children of
representing disintegrated objects in VWM, that is, failing to
recognize exactly which object features were where in the
visual scene? This failure should present challenges in tasks
that rely heavily on object-centered spatial frames, and 4year-olds have difficulty in such tasks including block
construction and drawing, visuo-motor alignment tasks, and
tasks that assess spatial relations across multiple objects
(Landau & Hoffman, 2007). Nevertheless, in supportive
situations, children may compensate by using long-term
visual memory, as described above (see also, Simmering &
Spencer, 2009). Indeed, there might be adaptive reasons to
not bind visual features together in a fast, flexible manner in
early development—this would help minimize errors in
binding until enough evidence accumulates in long-term

We computed these scores for SS1 only because it is
inappropriate to compare bias across conditions that affect change
and no change trials differentially (i.e., multi-item trials in this
study; see Figure 2).

alarms” are incorrect responses on no change trials. Because zscores cannot be computed on values of 0 or 1, these values were
replaced with 0.01 and 0.99, respectively.

visual memory to support a fully integrated representation
of objects.
Note that our data do not address whether young
children’s difficulty in the feature binding task arises during
the encoding, maintenance, or comparison of items that is
required for the change detection task. Moreover, we cannot
determine whether the feature-binding deficit at 4 years
reflects a problem binding multiple features to one location
or binding features together. For instance, several
researchers have proposed that feature binding is achieved
via phase-locked neural oscillations rather than through
spatial means (Crick & Koch, 1995). Although this is
computationally viable, it is not clear from this perspective
why 4-year-olds, but not 5-year-olds, have difficulty binding
features in VWM. By contrast, the developmental parallel
between our findings and research on spatial cognitive
development (e.g., Nardini et al., 2006) implicates some role
for binding through space, although conclusive evidence
will require studies that compare spatial memory and
feature-binding performance within individual subjects.
