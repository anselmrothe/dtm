Abstract: In this paper we investigate how frequency and amount of punishment affect Iranian subjectsâ€™ decision
making. In our first experiment, performing a computer-based Persian version of the Iowa Gambling task, participants
consistently chose more frequently and more rapidly from decks which had less frequent but larger amounts of
punishments in comparison to decks which had more frequent punishments with smaller amounts. In our second
experiment, participants did not differentiate between decks with the same frequency of punishment but with different
punishment amounts. However, among decks which had the same amount but different frequency of punishment, a
significant preference was apparent towards decks with less frequency of punishment. Our results are rather different
from previous studies, indicating a different strategy in risky decision making among Iranian subjects, as they show
low attention to the amount of punishment and are more concerned with the frequency of punishment.
