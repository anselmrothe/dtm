Keywords: conjunction fallacy; confirmation theory.

Since the early Eighties, about a hundred scientific papers
on the conjunction fallacy (CF) have been published. Such
wide interest is easy to understand, as CF has become a key
topic in the fervent debate on human rationality. Indeed,
from the very beginning the CF phenomenon has been
described as a violation of “the simplest and the most basic
qualitative law of probability” (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983,
p.293). The law at issue is the conjunction rule and states
that the joint occurrence of a pair of events cannot be more
probable than the occurrence of anyone of them. However,
despite such a plethora of studies (see for example, Tentori
et al, 2004; Bonini et al. 2004), CF still lacks a satisfactory
interpretation as well as a model predicting under which
general conditions its occurrence should be expected.
The original
explanation
in terms
of the
“representativeness heuristic” (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983)
has been challenged as being “vague” (Gigerenzer, 1996)
and at odds with scenarios involving forecasts and
prognoses (Crupi et al., 2008). Alternative accounts
postulate that people may assess the probability of a
conjunction by a (non-normative) averaging rule as applied
to the constituents’ probabilities (Fantino et al., 1997) or
represents CF as an effects of random error in the judgment
process (Costello, 2008). An important common feature of
these accounts is the prediction that CF rates will raise as
the judged probability of the added conjunct does.
We developed a novel reading of the phenomenon (Crupi
et al. 2008; Tentori & Crupi, 2009) as based on inductive
confirmation, a central notion in Bayesian epistemology
(Crupi et al. 2007) whose relevance has been recently
documented in the psychology of reasoning (Tentori et al.
2007a; Tentori et. al 2007b).
Three studies will be presented as testing the diverging
predictions of traditional accounts of CF as opposed to those
arising from the confirmation-theoretic analysis. In our
investigations, the probability of the added conjunct in CF
problems has been systematically manipulated and
dissociated from corresponding degrees of (Bayesian)
confirmation in controlled conditions.
The data obtained strongly favor a confirmation-theoretic
account of CF against competing hypotheses relying on the
probability of the conjuncts as major determinants of the
phenomenon. Apparently, intuitive assessments of
confirmation relations are crucially involved in major

probabilistic mistakes. Such a result sheds new light on the
subtle connection between probabilistic and inductive
reasoning in human cognition.
