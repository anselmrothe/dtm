Abstract: The regional interaction structure of brain biopotentials has been studied in adults during phonemic verbal
tasks: phoneme recognition in auditory presented words, generating words from auditory presented set of phonemes
and controlled word association. Using cross-correlation and coherent analyses of EEG we observed differences in
spatio-temporal structure of brain biopotentials interaction. Noticeable intensification of hemispheric interaction was
observed during phoneme recognition, especially in theta and delta frequency bands between temporal areas of both
hemispheres. During generating words the changes in the hemispheric interactions were most pronounced in the
temporal, especially in Wernikes zone, temporo-parieto-occipital areas of both hemispheres. Remarkable increasing
of regional interactions in occipital areas with decreasing interactions in frontal areas was observed during controlled
word association. Our data shown that differences in regional interaction structure of brain biopotentials during
verbal tasks in phonemic language level depends of different task performance in spite of phonological specificity
tasks.
