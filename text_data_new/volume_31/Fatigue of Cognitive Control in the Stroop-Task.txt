Abstract

Meijman, & Lorist, 2006; Lorist, Boksem, & Ridderinkhof,
2005). In a simple two-choice reaction task which had to be
performed for two hours, Boksem et al. (2006) found a slight
decrease of response time (RT) with time on task and an increase of errors with time on task. In addition, they found a
post-error slowing of RT which, however, disappeared with
time-on-task. The latter finding is of special interest in the
context of mental fatigue: it indicates impaired error monitoring and suboptimal behavioral adjustment with mental fatigue. Using a very similar set-up, Lorist et al. (2005) also
found a slight decrease of RT with time on task and an interaction of post-error slowing with time on task.

Working on cognitively demanding tasks for a long time leads
to a state of mental fatigue, which involves increased distractability, impaired error monitoring, or more generally an
impairment of cognitive control processes. The present study
indicates that cognitive control can deteriorate already after
about 15 minutes. During a Stroop task, a classical measure
of inhibitory control, where a high number of congruent trials
encourages goal neglect and thus increases working memory
load, error rate and the variability of response times increased
over the course of 480 trials. These results can be interpreted
as indicative of a gradual impairment of cognitive control due
to the continuous exertion of cognitive control.
Keywords: executive function; response time distribution;
mental fatigue; inhibitory control; response variability; Stroop.

Cognitive Control as a Depletable Resource Whereas
mental fatigue has been studied with simple repetitive tasks,
social psychologists have studied the loss of cognitive control
in more complex settings. Investigating the broadly defined
construct of self-control as the “ability to override or change
one’s inner responses, as well as to interrupt undesired behavioral tendencies and refrain from acting on them” (Tangney,
Baumeister, & Boone, 2004, p.275), dozens of studies have
shown that self-control for some task is hampered when the
task directly follows another task involving self-control (for
a review, see Schmeichel & Baumeister, 2004). For example, Hofmann, Rauch, and Gawronski (2007) have shown
that suppressing one’s emotional expressions impairs subsequent efforts at controlled (vs. automatic) processing: after
the emotion suppression task, the amount of candy consumption could be better predicted by an implicit measure of attitudes toward candy than by an explicit dietary restraint scale.
Yet attempts at self-control also have an influence on simpler tasks assumed to assess cognitive control. Richeson and
Shelton (2003) have shown that efforts at self-control hamper performance in a subsequent Stroop task. In the Stroop
task, cognitive control is necessary for an active maintenance
of the goal of naming the color instead of reading the word;
the controlled processing of naming the color has to be given
top-down priority compared with the automatized processing
of the word.
Unlike in studies of mental fatigue, studies of self-control
loss have until now only focused on group-level comparisons
of outcomes after an experimental intervention. In the typical
set-up of such a study, the experimental group has to perform
two self-control tasks after another, while the control group
only performs the second task. Performance on the second
task then is used as the dependent variable. Such a design can
neither detect interindividual differences in self-control loss
nor does it inform about the time evolution of self-control
loss. Consequently, it is not yet known whether self-control

Cognitive Control and Cognitive Fatigue
Cognitive control is a general concept, which is broadly defined and refers to several abilities: Goal setting, maintaining
goal-directed behavior, performance monitoring, and adjusting behavior in case of errors and in the face of distractions
and obstacles (e.g. Ridderinkhof, Wildenberg, Segalowitz, &
Carter, 2004). Cognitive control can also be defined as the
top-down or executive component of cognition. The capacity
for cognitive control is of central importance for many behaviors, especially in the pursuit of long-term goals, in emotional
and social adjustment, and in many other areas.
The capacity for cognitive control varies across individuals (Miyake et al., 2000). In addition to genetic influences,
it is known that age-related declines in neurobiological systems (Braver et al., 2001) as well as psychiatric disorders
(e.g. Geurts et al., 2008) can impair the capacity for cognitive control. But the capacity for cognitive control also varies
intra-individually: Performance on tasks involving cognitive
control can be enhanced as a function of incentives (Sarter,
Gehring, & Kozak, 2006), and performance deteriorates after sleep deprivation (Chuah, Venkatraman, Dinges, & Chee,
2006). Finally, working on cognitively demanding tasks for
a long time (Boksem & Tops, 2008) and previous exertion
of cognitive control (Schmeichel & Baumeister, 2004) impair
this capacity.

Losing (Cognitive) Control
Mental Fatigue Cognitive control becomes more difficult
when working for a long time. This phenomenon has been
called “mental fatigue”, which refers to both a subjective
feeling of “tiredness or even exhaustion . . . , and a decrease
in the level of commitment to the task at hand” (Boksem &
Tops, 2008, p. 126) and to more objective consequences such
as increased distractibility or impaired error monitoring and
failure to adjusting one’s responses after an error (Boksem,

had to be performed.

on congruent trials (Kane & Engle, 2003). Thus, a Stroop
task with a large proportion of congruent trials requires not
only to inhibit the automatized response (reading the word),
but also to actively maintain the goal (naming the color) in
working memory. We assume that having to execute a Stroop
task with a large proportion of congruent trials for an intermediate duration (∼ 15 minutes) gradually impairs cognitive
control resources. This impairment of cognitive control resources should lead to failures of goal maintenance and error
monitoring processes, so that more errors occur in later stages
of the task. We also explore changes in response times (RTs),
since the gradual impairment of cognitive control might lead
to more effortful processing in later stages of the tasks. Effortful processing in later stages of the task might also lead
to an increased variability of RTs, especially in the case of
lapses of cognitive control, leading to errors.
In addition to the substantive goals we wanted to explore
the benefits and additional insights of a time-course oriented and intra-individual analysis when studying mental fatigue and the depletion of cognitive control. Studies of the
loss of self-control after a previous exertion of self-control
have as yet only analyzed intraindividually and interindividually averaged responses (group-level approach). A goal of
the present study is to explore the time evolution of errors,
response times and intra-individual variability of response
times (cf. Castellanos et al., 2005), thereby extending the
analysis of the loss of control from simple before/after effects
to the analysis of a gradual decrease of cognitive control. We
assume that the Stroop task, which has already been shown
to be sensitive to self-control exertion effects, can be used to
study the loss of self-control intraindividually, time-oriented,
and without the need for a second self-control task.

Inhibition as a Cognitive Control Process
The general construct of cognitive control can be divided into
several related, yet separable functions (Miyake et al., 2000;
Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). Cognitive control is apparent in
top-down processes such as shifting between two task sets,
error monitoring, or maintaining a specific, non-automatized
response set even when other stimulus-response (S-R) mappings are strongly activated. The latter process is known
as inhibitory control: maintenance of a non-automatized response set can be assumed to involve active inhibition of the
prepotent, more automatized response. Inhibition plays a major role not only in “cool” cognition, but also in emotional adjustment, withstanding inadequate or even harmful impulses
and tempations (alcohol and drug abuse, risky sexual behavior), and may even be linked to educational and professional
achievement (Schmeichel & Baumeister, 2004; Tangney et
al., 2004).
In the assessment of inhibitory control, tasks are employed
where the manner of responding for a prepotent, i.e. automatized S-R mapping is compared with the manner of responding when the automatized reaction has to be inhibited. In
go/no-go tasks, for example, participants are required to respond as quickly as possible to a large number of stimuli,
but have to refrain from responding in case of the infrequent
and irregular appearance of a small subset of stimuli. Another
frequently employed inhibition task is the classic Stroop task:
In this task, color words are printed in colored ink. For congruent trials, the color word is the same as the print color
(e.g. the word ”red” is displayed in red); for incongruent trials, word and color differ (e.g. the word ”green” is displayed
in red). Naming the color is assumed to involve inhibition
of the automatized response to read the word; accordingly,
naming the color is slower and more error-prone than reading the word, especially for incongruent trials, as has been
demonstrated in literally thousands of studies (MacLeod &
MacDonald, 2000).

Method
Participants and Procedure
Participants were 21 undergraduate psychology students, 15
female, aged 19 to 36 years (mean = 22.9, sd= 5.1) who received course credits in exchange for participation. All participants were tested individually; the experimenter remained
in the room for the entire session. Stimuli (color words) were
presented on a computer screen, and participants had to name
the colour the word was presented in. After a short practice session, 480 trials were performed. Each trial began with
the presentation of a fixation cross (black on a silver background) for 400 ms. Then, the fixation cross was immediately
replaced by one of four color words (“red”, “blue”, “green”,
or “yellow”) presented in either red, blue, green, or yellow.
The same pseudo-random sequence of trials was used for all
participants; the trial sequence was constructed so that 50%
of trials were congruent (i.e. word and color were the same),
while all other (incongruent) color-word combinations were
equally likely. The response time (RT) was measured as the
time point a participant started to speak. Participants pressed
a button in order to proceed to the next trial. Thus, total duration depended on participants’ RT and varied from about 11

Motivation and Goal of the Present Study
Mental fatigue has mainly been studied in extended time
frames, with tasks that have to be carried out for at least two
hours. In the literature on the loss of self-control, however,
it has been shown that cognitive control can be impaired already after short and simple attempts at self-control. Another
central difference of the two research approaches lies in the
complexity of the experimental tasks: Studies of mental fatigue have mostly applied very easy tasks involving only a
little amount of cognitive control.
In the present study, a Stroop color-word task is used with a
large proportion of congruent trials, i.e. trials where color and
word match. A large proportion of congruent trials encourages neglecting the goal of naming the color, since the more
automatized response of reading the word can become active

minutes to about 18 minutes. The experimenter recorded errors (reading the word instead of the color, then proceeding
to the next trial) and corrected responses (starting to read the
word or reading the word, then naming the color).

Data Processing For each participant, we analyzed the
number of errors and the number of corrected responses. We
assume that corrected responses reflect a different kind of
cognitive process than errors: In the case of correcting a false
response, the cognitive control process of error monitoring
becomes active with a small delay; in the case of an error, the
participant proceeds to the next trial and the error monitoring process does not become active at all (cf. Boksem et al.,
2006)
Analysis of Change A central goal of the present study is
the intraindividual analysis of changes in the distribution of
erroneous responses and of changes in RT distribution during
the time course of the task. Consequently (cf. Rouder, Lu,
Speckman, Sun, & Jiang, 2005), we employed hierarchical
regression models (aka random effects or multilevel models)
with random intercepts for participants 1 .

Blocks of 40 Trials; Mean RT in Italics.

Several kinds of models were analyzed for the number of
errors, the number of corrected responses, RTs, and RT variability using the different kinds of data sets: Models differed
with regard to the construction of the time effect. The time
effect was modeled by including a predictor variable coding for blocks of subsequent trials. Two different ratios of
number of trials per block/number of blocks were analyzed:
(1) 12 blocks of 40 trials and (2) 4 blocks of 120 trials. For
both kinds of blocking, polynomial contrasts were used to test
for non-linear effects of time in addition to the linear effect.
Since in no case any replicable different effect could be found
for the two kinds of blocking, we will report only results for
the analyses with 4 blocks of 120 trials.
Preprocessing in the Analysis of RT and RT Variability
For the analysis of RT and RT variability, raw RTs were analyzed. Neither the exclusion of RTs from erroneous or corrected responses nor setting all RTs < 200ms to a value of
200ms as well as setting RTs > 3000ms to a value of 3000ms
(cf. Miyake et al., 2000) yielded results that differed considerably from the analyses of raw RTs.

Results
Errors and Corrected Responses
Descriptive Analysis Altogether, participants produced
very few errors (98 ≈ .97%) and corrected responses (204 ≈
2.02%). Participants varied widely in the number of errors
(0 − 34; sd = 8.3), with 6 participants without any errors, and
less strongly in the number of corrected responses (1 − 21;
sd = 5.8). The number of errors and the number of corrections were negatively correlated (r = −.31). Figure 1 presents
errors and corrected responses tabulated by Subject for 12
Blocks of 40 trials, figure 2 shows the mean number of errors (grey bars) and mean response times (black dots) for 12
Blocks of 40 trials for all participants.
Errors and Time Course For the analysis of errors, hierarchical logistic regression models were analyzed2 . As expected, there was a strong effect of congruency (z = −6.43,
p < .001)3 , with the odds of committing an error being almost
20 times higher for non-congruent trials. For time course
(block number), a test for polynomial contrasts revealed a linear effect of time (z = 2.29, p = .03) with the odds of committing an error increasing by a factor of 1.24 for every block
of 120. Congruency and time course did not interact.

For the analysis of RT variability, the different kinds of raw
and preprocessed RT data were logarithmized; then, for each
data set, variances were computed for 12 blocks of 40 trials
or for 4 blocks of 120 trials. These variability data were then
also subjected to hierarchical regression models, testing for
linear and non-linear effects of time using polynomial contrasts.

2 Note that only results for the models with 4 blocks of 120 trials
will be reported, since the kind of blocking did not change results;
see above.
3 One reviewer suggested to repeat these analyses excluding the
participant with the largest number of errors (displayed in the upper
right corner of all figures). This did not change the pattern of the
results.

1 A random intercept means that interindividual differences in the
mean of the dependent variable independent of the predictors are
accounted for in the model.

vs. incongruent trials across 12 blocks of 40 trials. In each
panel, non-parametric regression lines are plotted for congruent vs. incongruent trials.

Corrected Responses and Time Course For corrected responses, there was an even stronger effect of congruency,
with the odds of producing a corrected response being 78.5
times higher for incongruent trials. No significant effect of
time course was found for corrected responses. However,
there was a significant (z = 2.14, p = .03) interaction of congruency and time course: with each block of 120 trials, the
odds ratio for the congruency effect decreased by a factor of
.55; this means that for later blocks, the probability of producing a corrected response for congruent trials slightly increased.

RT Variability
In the hierarchical regression models for RT variability, the
linear effect of time course showed a significant (z = 3.32,
p < .01 for variances of logarithmized RT) increase of RT
variability with time. This effect remained for all kinds of
models. Figure 4 displays variances of logarithmized RT for
12 Blocks of 40 trials tabulated by subject together with both
linear (solid) and non-parametric (dashed) regression lines for
each subject.

Response Times

Discussion

None of the analyses revealed any systematic pattern of RT
change over time. Only in some of the analyses, a small decrease of RTs was apparent, but this decrease was not apparent for all participants, as indicated by the need to incorporate
random slopes for the time effect. Also, the small decrease
might be due to a smaller post-error slowing effect at later
stages of the task (see below).
As expected, RTs for congruent trials were faster with a
strong effect (mean difference for raw RTs = 164ms), but
there was no interaction with time course. Figure 3 displays
mean RTs (raw) for congruent vs. incongruent trials for 12
Blocks of 40 trials tabulated by subject together with a nonparametric regression line for each subject. Mean RT (raw)
correlated positively with the number of corrections (r = .19)
and negatively with number of errors (r = −.28).
RT increased for trials following an error (post-error slowing; raw mean increase = 465ms) and following a corrected
response (raw mean increase = 476ms). For trials following
an error, this effect slightly decreased with time course, but
this interaction effect failed to reach significance (z = −1.10,
p = .14 for raw data), which might be due to the fact that only
few errors were produced on the whole.

In the present study, a Stroop task had to be carried out with
a large proportion of congruent trials. This large proportion
of congruent trials paradoxically increases working memory
load (Kane & Engle, 2003), since congruent trials encourage goal neglect such that the goal of naming the color has
to be actively maintained in working memory and can not be
automatized during the time course of the task. Due to this
complication, the task was more cognitively demanding than
tasks used previously in the analysis of mental fatigue; in addition, since the Stroop task has also been employed in studies
of self-control loss, an analysis of the time evolution of this
loss of cognitive control was possible.

Time Evolution of Errors and Corrected Responses
As expected, the amount of errors increased during the time
course of the Stroop task, indicating that the participants’
ability to inhibit the automatized response of reading the word
instead of naming the color decreased over time. Errors in the
Stroop task can be viewed not only as failures in inhibitory
control, but also as failures in executive monitoring and behavioral adjustment, when participants proceed to the next
trial without noticing the error. The finding of a decrease in

753

in the first row, upper right corner) was the one with the smallest mean RT and the one with the second largest number of
errors. Anyhow, there were strong interindividual differences
in mean RT, as evidenced by differences in mean RT (raw;
sd = 192ms) being somewhat greater than the mean effect of
congruency (164ms), just as there were strong interindividual differences in the number of errors. These interindividual
differences in addition to the intraindividual differences evident in the time evolution of the number of errors and RT
variability once more illustrate the need for an in-depth analysis of responses to cognitive tasks instead of just group-level
comparisons of intraindividually averaged responses.
The increase in RT variability during the time course of the
Stroop task, on the other hand, is consistent with the results of
Boksem et al.’s (2006) analysis of mental fatigue. Increased
RT variability can not be due alone to the combined effect of
post-error slowing and increase of error rates, since the posterror slowing effect slightly decreased with time. Instead,
increased RT variability was visible even when only correct
responses were analyzed. An explanation for increased variability might be the impaired capacity for goal maintenance
(see above) and action monitoring as in mental fatigue: On
some trials at later stages, participants seem to have actively
“struggled” to produce a correct response, increasing their RT
on these trials above the response speed obtained at the beginning of the task. This interpretation is strengthened by the
observation of initially incorrectly processed congruent trials
in later stages of the task.
The increase of RT variability together with the results on
the time evolution of errors and corrected responses hint at
the explanation of a gradual impairment of goal maintenance
and error monitoring with time on task, results that have already been obtained in the study of mental fatigue. An interesting result is the similarity of the performance pattern
in the present study with the performance of children with
ADHD (Johnson et al., 2007; Di Martino et al., 2008): Not
only does the performance of children with ADHD decrease
over time, their RTs exhibit a high intraindividual variability.
However, for ADHD children RT variability is observable already from the beginning of a task, with simpler tasks and in
shorter time frames. Despite this difference, the overall similarity of performance deficits in ADHD and impaired performance in mental fatigue hints at the possibility of common
neural pathways of mental fatigue and ADHD.

error monitoring fits into results obtained in studies of mental fatigue (Boksem et al., 2006; Lorist et al., 2005), even if
in the present study the duration was much shorter and the
total number of trials much smaller than in studies of mental
fatigue.
Interestingly, the number of corrected responses was not
systematically related to the time course. This lack of a main
effect however does not attenuate the general conclusion too
much: the interaction of congruency and time course for the
number of corrected responses means that during later stages
of the task, participants sometimes started to name a color
that was neither displayed as a word nor as a color 4 . Thus,
it seems that repeated execution of the task generally impairs
participants’ cognitive control with regard to maintaining the
goal of naming the color: During the first stages of the task,
congruent trials were processed correctly, while some errors
and some instantly corrected errors occurred for incongruent trials. During the later stages, even congruent trials were
sometimes processed incorrectly. Because such a wrong processing is far more easy to detect for congruent trials, it could
be instantly corrected.

Response Times and RT Variability
Unlike in studies of mental fatigue (e.g. Lorist et al., 2005),
RTs did not increase systematically over the time course; instead, there was even some small evidence for a slight decrease of RTs during the time course. The lack of a systematic
pattern of RT change might be due to interindividually different response strategies; the negative correlation of mean RT
and number of errors at least hints that participants differed
in terms of a speed-accuracy trade-off. The only participant
with a clear increase in RT (see figure 3, second-to-last panel

Gradually Losing Control: Short-Term Mental
Fatigue
In the present study mental fatigue was studied using a shortterm approach: Instead of having to perform simple tasks
over two hours or more, a slightly more complex task was
employed for a much shorter time (∼ 15 minutes). Some
effects of mental fatigue were observable already after this
short time course. Still, Boksem et al. (2006) and Lorist et al.
(2005) have observed a decrease in RT after about an hour on
task, an effect that could not be replicated in our study. Future
studies might vary the time on task in order to explore these

named before the correct response was given.

phenomena more closely.
To our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to combine the approaches of research on mental fatigue with the
ideas of research on self-control loss. While the underlying
causes of self-control loss are as yet unclear (but see Gailliot
& Baumeister, 2007), this study adds to the first attempts to
integrate the results on self-control loss with the vast body
of knowledge on cognitive control and executive functions.
Just as in previous studies (Hofmann et al., 2007), we have
shown that the exertion of cognitive control leads to an increase of automatic processing: with prolonged time on task,
participants failed to maintain the goal of naming the color in
working memory and thus failed to inhibit the tendency for
automatized processing (reading).
Our intraindividually and change-centered analysis gives
evidence that there is still something to learn even from a
multiply employed task such as the Stroop. We believe that
our results give some evidence for the possibility of a crossdisciplinary integration of the theories on mental fatigue and
on self-control loss after previuous exertion of self-control.
