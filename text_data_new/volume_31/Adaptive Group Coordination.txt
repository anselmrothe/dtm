Abstract
Human groups exhibit poor performance in many social
situations because task constraints promote either individual
maximization behavior or diffusion of responsibility. We
introduce a group task that tests human coordination when
only a shared group goal exists. Without communication,
group members submit numbers in an attempt to collectively
sum to a randomly selected number. After receiving group
feedback, members adjust their submitted numbers in the next
round. Small groups generally outperform large groups, and
for all groups, performance improves with task experience,
and reactivity to feedback decreases over rounds. Our
empirical results and computational modeling provide
evidence for adaptive coordination in human groups despite
minimal shared history and only indirect communication, and
perhaps most interestingly, as the coordination costs increase
with group size, large groups adapt through spontaneous role
differentiation and self-consistency among members.

Introduction
Groups often suffer from behavioral limitations, including
impaired brainstorming performance (Kerr & Park, 2001),
difficulty in utilizing shared and unshared pieces of
information (Stasser & Titus, 1985), and inability to gauge
the relevant contributions of individual members
(Littlepage, Schmidt, Whisler, & Frost, 1995). Many group
limitations worsen as group size increases, and because
large groups confer anonymity, members increasingly fall
prey to diffusion of responsibility (Darley & Latane, 1968;
Freeman, Walker, Borden, & Latane, 1975). Even when
shared resource tasks encourage implicit coordination
(Ostrom, Gardner, & Walker, 1994), conflicts arise when
members choose individual gains over group gains.
However, many situations require coordinated
contributions in order to achieve a shared group goal. For
example, a potluck dinner ideally coordinates participants’
food contributions so there is enough to sate everyone,
without excess left-overs that no one wants to take home.
However, individuals often make unilateral decisions about
how much food to bring to the potluck. The question then
arises of how the group as a whole can coordinate the
correct amount of food to bring, with some individuals
volunteering to bring extra food to make up for other
individuals who forget to bring any food. Research labs
rely on the combined contributions of individuals to develop

a research program and lab reputation that leads to grant
funding, which may in turn benefit the individuals.
Similarly, statistical analyses in baseball and basketball
increasingly value players based on the team’s performance
while the player is in the game, rather than individual
statistics such as points scored (Berri, Schmidt, & Brook,
2006). In these examples, a group member can undermine a
team’s performance by either taking on too little or too great
a burden, and unlike intellective tasks in social psychology,
where a correct solution can propagate from an individual to
the rest of the group (Laughlin, 1980), these situations
involve the coordination or summation of multiple
individual contributions. Although some studies show that
group members can adequately share pieces of information
under the right circumstances (Stasser & Stewart, 1992;
Stewart & Stasser, 1995), and some group learning can
occur via indirect feedback (Maciejovsky & Budescu,
2007), there has been relatively little research on group
coordination and adaptation to tasks with shared goals.
In order to isolate and test the coordination capacities of
groups, we developed a simple round-based group game
called “Group Binary Search” (GBS) that creates a test bed
for pure coordination without competing individual goals.
In the GBS game, a computer server randomly chooses a
number between 51 and 100, and without communication,
each group member submits a guess between 0 and 50. The
computer compares the sum of participants’ numbers to its
selected number, and broadcasts the same directional (e.g.
“Too High”) or numeric (e.g. “Too Low by 17”) feedback to
all members. Given the range of individual guesses, group
members must coordinate to achieve the shared goal.
During the next round, members can adjust their guesses
and receive the new feedback, and the game continues until
the group correctly sums to the computer’s number. We
coined the name Group Binary Search after the binary
search algorithm in computer science (Knuth, 1997), which
searches for a number in a sorted list by iteratively guessing
the median number in the current range of possibilities. For
numeric GBS games, a normative solution suggests that all
players should change their guesses by Distance from Goal ,

individuals display a large variance in guess adjustments
due to their uncertainty regarding others’ actions. Stock
market investors face a similar dilemma when they know a
company’s expected value but fear trading on that
knowledge because of the unpredictable noise introduced by
other traders (Camerer & Fehr, 2006).
Our GBS game shares qualities of several other tasks
from game theory and behavioral economics, but GBS
uniquely tests participants’ adaptive coordination strategies
when only a shared group goal exists. Many 2 x 2
symmetric games such as Prisoner’s Dilemma display
coordination in order to achieve higher individual payoffs,
and in fact, simulations support the evolution of mutual
reciprocity in Prisoner’s Dilemma (Browning & Colman,
2004), and coordinated alternating reciprocity in games with
related payoff structures such as Battle of the Sexes, Leader,
and the route choice game (Helbing, Schonhof, Stark, &
Holyst, 2005). Each of these games emphasizes individual
maximization with clear payoff structures, while the GBS
game emphasizes group maximization without a clear trialbased payoff structure. Group members have a wide range
of possible guesses, and they do not receive rewards unless
the group goal is reached, so the task encourages group
members to continually make complementary guess
refinements until the goal is reached.
Even pure
coordination games in game theory focus on clear payoff
structures with pure – and sometimes mixed – strategies
leading to Nash equilibria (Colman, 2003).
Some more naturalistic framings of coordination allow a
wide range of responses, but still emphasize individual
payoffs in tasks such as group foraging (Roberts &
Goldstone, 2006), group path formation (Goldstone, Jones,
& Roberts, 2006), spontaneous traffic lane formation
(Helbing, Molnar, Farkas, & Bolay, 2001), and commons
dilemmas (Ostrom et al., 1994). In commons dilemmas,
group resources are typically over-harvested unless the
group communicates (Bouas & Komorita, 1996) or enacts
rules (Ostrom, Walker, & Gardner, 1992). However, given
that our later empirical and modeling results show adaptive
group behavior, it is intriguing that sequential sampling
versions of commons dilemmas demonstrate position effects
in which early samplers take large shares, and later samplers
request diminishing shares without even knowing how
many resources are left (Budescu & Au, 2002).
The GBS game also complements coordination tasks
geared towards larger populations, such as minority,
majority, and business entry games. The minority game
assumes that individuals want to avoid crowds, and it
examines how effectively individuals differentiate and
distribute themselves to two options, given that only
members of the resulting minority are rewarded (Arthur,
1994). Experimental and simulated minority games often
show oscillating group choice behavior, typically
approaching a 50/50 split between options, but the group
can deviate towards extreme proportions (e.g. 0% or 100%
select option A) if the members fail to differentiate (Botazzi
& Devetag, 2003). In contrast to simulation results (Savit,

Manuca, & Riolo, 1999), humans coordinate with minimal
information in minority games, and increased information
from longer reinforcement time windows does not improve
group performance. Majority games actually encourage
conformity and attempt to model situations where
individuals benefit from acting in crowds, such as
momentum trading and aggregating to form cities
(Kozlowski & Marsili, 2003). Self-fulfilling prophecies
naturally emerge in these situations, as momentum traders
flock to the majority stock (Marsili, 2001). Business entry
games occupy a gray area between minority and majority
games. In these tasks, individuals (businesses) receive a
small reward for staying out of a market and a large reward
for entering a market, but no one in the market receives a
reward if too many people join (Camerer & Fehr, 2006).
Each of these games differs from the GBS game by
encouraging conformity or differentiation in attempts to
maximize individual payoffs. The GBS game is agnostic to
strategies, allowing both coordination and differentiation of
strategies (substitutable or complementary strategies, as per
Camerer and Fehr (2006)) in pursuit of global coordination.

Methods
Participants
Participants were 106 undergraduate students at Indiana
University who received course credit for approximately 1
hour of participation. Participants were run in 18 GBS
experimental sessions with the following group sizes: 2, 2,
2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 10, 16, 17, 17. Each group
participated in 10 games, alternating between directional
feedback games and numeric feedback games. Participants
were instructed not to talk to each other, and they were
informed that there were a total of 10 games and they would
finish the experiment more quickly if their group quickly
coordinated to the solutions. We did not highlight the
number of participants in a group, but that information was
available, given that all group members were
simultaneously present and visible in the computer
laboratory.

Material and Procedure
Participants sat in a university computer lab at personal
computers running the game via client Java applets
connected to a computer server. Before each game, the
server randomly chose a number between 51 and 100.
During each round, each participant entered a guess between
0 and 50. After a 15 second guessing period elapsed, the
server compared the sum of participants’ guesses to its
number, broadcast the same feedback to all participants’
screens, and began the next round. Participants only knew
the group sum’s relation to the server’s number (e.g. “Too
high” for directional feedback games, or “Too high by 17”
for numeric feedback games), without knowing the server’s
actual number or the current group sum. If the participants’
guesses correctly summed to the server’s number, or if 15

next game began after a short delay.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows directional feedback games from a 2- and
17-participant group, and all graphs for the 18 groups are
at: http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/GBS_graphs.zip. In
general, groups coordinated very well, with 7.03 average
rounds to solution for numeric feedback games, and 10.51
for directional feedback games, a significant difference
under a two-tailed t test, t(17) = 5.47, p < .001. For many of
the analyses, we defined “small groups” as groups with 2 or
3 participants, and “large groups” as groups with 10 or more
participants. These group sizes showed strongly contrasting
behavior that will be discussed later, while the medium-size
groups displayed a mixture of behaviors from the two group
types. Small groups solved the games in an average of 6.80
rounds (numeric=4.31, directional=9.34), compared to 11.95
rounds for large groups (numeric=11.05, directional=12.85),
t(11) = 6.46, p < .001. These results suggest that
participants successfully modulate their reactions based on
the feedback magnitude, and small groups, with their fewer
degrees of freedom and decreased uncertainty, coordinate
more quickly. One can imagine large groups allowing
reactions to offset each other, thus averaging and
coordinating to the solution more rapidly, but instead the
larger groups exhibited larger oscillations. All group sizes
showed similar improvement across games, with a -.264
correlation between game number and average rounds to
solution, p < .001, and both large and small groups showed
approximately the same learning correlations, -.270 and .273, respectively (the medium size groups slightly lower
the average). Figure 2 shows similar learning in numeric
and directional feedback games.
In order to examine consistent behaviors among
participants, we calculated each participant’s “reactivity”
according to the formula (Gr – Gr-1) if the group was too low
on the previous round, and (Gr-1– Gr) if the group was too
high, where Gr is the participant’s guess on round r. Groups
generally under-react, as shown in Figure 3, though only

small groups significantly under-react. These results are
particularly revealing for directional feedback games,
because groups react surprisingly close to the best-fit line
despite only receiving directional information. In these
cases, groups may follow a conservative strategy of
gradually decreasing reactivities over rounds. In numeric
feedback games, large magnitude feedback tempts
individuals in large groups to over-react and form outliers,
but overall, the analyses support a nuanced strategy of
decreasing reactivity over time in both feedback conditions.
The average reactivity of group members per round
significantly decreases over the last six rounds prior to
solution (This method of aligning rounds maintains some
equivalence between numeric and directional games, and
small and large groups, given their different solution times),
ß = -.326, p = .001. However, a paired samples t test for all
games of all groups reveals that participants significantly
decrease their reactivities when the feedback direction (even
for numeric feedback games) changes from one round to the
next (mean decrease of 1.55), but maintain approximately
the same reactivity (mean decrease of .11) when the
feedback direction remains the same, t(148) = 4.75, p <
.001.

Models
Using agent-based models, we tested several reactivity
strategies. For each model, we ran 18 groups in 10
directional feedback games, and we matched group sizes to
our empirical groups. Each agent first sampled from an
empirically derived initial guess distribution that took into
account group size, such that there were three derived
distributions, for large, small, and medium group sizes. On
the second round, agents chose a reactivity from a uniform
random distribution with a range of 0 to (50–current guess)
if the group was too low on the previous round, and from a
range of (-1*current guess) to 0 if the group was too high on
the previous round. In order to maintain more realistic
reactivities, we further constrained agents to sample until
they chose a reactivity within the range -20 to +20. Model 1

Figure 3: Average group reactivity for each distance from
the correct solution
and Model 2 agents continued sampling reactivities in this
fashion for every round of a game, but Model 2 agents
probabilistically decreased their sampled reactivities across
rounds. On each round, each possible reactivity number in
the range -20 to +20 had a .5 probability of decreasing by an
integer chosen from the uniform random range 0 to 5. For
example, a Model 2 agent that would have chosen a +18
reactivity in round 6 may actually increase its guess by +12,
because the chosen +18 reactivity was decreased across
rounds. These random decreases were computed separately
for each group game. Models 1 and 2 constitute groups that
produce reaction in a feedback-consistent direction, €
and
Model 2 adds the assumption that reactions decrease over
time. Models 3 and 4 replace these random reactivity
decreases with the notion of agent consistency, Each agent
sampled a reactivity on the second round, and on each
subsequent round, a Model 3 agent had a .5 probability of
decreasing its reactivity by an integer chosen from the
uniform random range 0 to 5, while a Model 4 agent only
decreased its reactivity when the group feedback changed
(e.g. from “Too High” to “Too Low”), and otherwise
maintained the same reactivity from round to round. Thus,
these models tested whether consistent agents should simply
decrease their reactivities over time, or selectively decrease
their reactivities when the feedback changed, as our
empirical results support.
Model 4 coordinated significantly faster than the other

models (means: Model 1=13.63, Model 2=12.84, Model
3=12.00, Model 4=10.29, Empirical=10.51), p < .001 for all
pairwise model comparisons with Model 4, and was
indistinguishable from our empirical results for directional
feedback games, p = .684. The same model can solve
numeric feedback games more quickly by modifying the
range of initial agent reactivities according to the numeric
feedback. Models 1, 2, and 3 were not significantly
different from each other in pairwise comparisons, which
illustrates the importance of flexible group coordination.
Intuitively, Model 4 agents take large steps towards the goal
when they are far away, then decrease their step sizes after
passing the goal. In contrast, the approximate simulated
annealing strategy (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, & Vecchi, 1983)
from Model 3 does not efficiently span large initial-to-goal
distances unless it anneals slowly, but slow annealing
results in inefficient oscillations around the goal. We
further tested this intuition by comparing Models 3 and 4 on
extended games that could go up to 30 rounds, and the
influence of unsolved games especially hurt the average
solution time for Model 3 (means: Model 3=18.99, Model
4=14.53, p < .001). When we tried to improve Model 3’s
performance with alternative values for the probability of
reactivity decreases per round and the size of the uniform
random range, Model 3 still converged on the target more
slowly than Model 4 and our human participants because its
agents failed to adjust their reactivities according to
feedback. It is also noteworthy – but expected – that
randomly choosing reactivities as in Models 1 and 2 cannot
explain the empirical results, even when reactivities are
constrained to a range and decreased over time.
Groups in numeric feedback games clearly do not pursue
the expedient normative strategy. That strategy would
quickly lead to a solution, and it should be an easy strategy
for small groups to follow, but it requires everyone to
simultaneously adjust their guesses by Distance from Goal ,

numeric feedback rounds were evenly divisible for small
groups, compared with 3.2% for large groups, t(11) = 2.503,
p < .05. However, for these evenly divisible rounds,
participants rarely employed the normative strategy, with an
average of 14.9% of small group members and 0% of large
group members employing the strategy on applicable
rounds, t(11) = 1.59, p = .14. Instead, in conjunction with
our empirical results that participants’ reactivities decrease
when the group feedback changes, our models suggest that
human groups use a flexible, adaptive strategy for group
coordination when members are uncertain about others’
actions.

Group Differentiation
The results so far have implied similar coordination
mechanisms in small and large groups, but our final
analyses show striking divergent behavior. We calculated

2701

the variance of reactivities within individuals (Did a
participant exhibit consistent reactivities across rounds?)
and between individuals (Did all group members have
similar average reactivities?). For each of these analyses, we
used groups – rather than individuals – as the unit of
analysis by averaging over the individuals within a group.
Individual variance significantly decreases over rounds (ß =
-.519, p < .001) for large groups, but marginally increases
for small groups (ß = .165, p = .083). The variance of
reactivities among large group members marginally
increases over games (ß = .291, p = .068), and greater
variance among large group members significantly predicts
faster coordination (ß = -.395, p = .012). In contrast, the
variance among small group members significantly
decreases over games (ß = -.370, p < .001), and does not
predict solution time. The average reactivity of large group
members also decreases across games (ß = -.313, p = .049),
but there is no such relationship for small groups (ß = -.04, p
= .708).
Taken together, these results suggest that it is beneficial
for members of large groups to differentiate themselves
from each other, and then maintain those roles in order to
foster a predictable environment for subsequent adjustment
and coordination. Human participants appear to adapt
flexibly to the contingencies of group coordination, even
when group members have minimal shared history and only
indirect communication. The greater difficulty of the task
for large groups may serve as a selective pressure that forces
specialization. All of the group members are pursuing the
solution, but some manifest this pursuit by adjusting their
guesses, while others adopt small or zero reactivities in
order to decrease the group uncertainty. Our analyses
indicate that large groups coordinate more quickly when
group members assume these complementary roles.
Meanwhile, members of small groups can react in similar
magnitudes, without even being self-consistent, and still
coordinate rather quickly.
In post-task interviews, large groups invariably had many
participants who stated that they stopped reacting once the
group was close to the goal, because they assumed someone
else would react, and having too many reactive people
would risk overshooting the target solution. In this respect,
the GBS game is a paradigmatic task where orderly
diffusion of responsibility is a good thing. A simple
strategy for dropping-out can lead to deadlock if too many
people adopt it, so the group must coordinate its metastrategy in order to coordinate to the goal. However, it is
also possible to take meta-strategies too far. In each large
group, at least one person mentioned attempting to
compensate for an anticipated group over-reaction by
reacting in the opposite direction when the group neared the
goal. Analyses indicate that groups would have coordinated
faster without this extra compensation.
Both large and small groups showed impressive learning
trajectories, so it may prove worthwhile to examine groups
that have played many more GBS games in order to test the
limits of group differentiation and adaptation. Previous

research indicates that diversity (Page, 2007) and transactive
memory systems with divisions of cognitive labor (Wegner,
1987; Lewis, Lange, & Gillis, 2005) can improve group
problem-solving. However, diversity only helps when
group members recognize other members’ roles (Polzer,
Milton, & Swann, 2002), and group members sometimes
fail to adapt their roles to changing group conditions (Lewis,
Belliveau, Herndon, & Keller, 2007), which suggests that
members of our large or small groups may require
significant adjustment periods if we shift group sizes or
memberships.

Conclusion
Our current research indicates that the GBS game is a useful
framework for testing self-organized division of labor, role
development in groups, and relations between individuals’
strategies and group-level outcomes. This approach is
distinct from previous studies that emphasize either
competition among individuals while maximizing individual
returns, or the propagation of individual solutions or
information through a group. Many real world situations
(scientific research teams, sports teams, multi-party business
negotiations, committees, etc.) intrinsically involve actors
adjusting their contributions in order to achieve a mutually
satisfactory group goal, a win-win result. These tasks
cannot be solved by lone individuals, and the participation
of other individuals inevitably brings uncertainty. In these
tasks, more activity is not necessarily better; rather, an
individual’s role must complement others’ roles and actions
to achieve the desired outcome. Our results suggest that
teams of individuals with minimal shared history and
minimal communication automatically adjust their effective
sizes and member roles so that they coordinate appropriately
for a task’s complexity.
Although the GBS game is inherently a simple task, we
view this as an advantage that allows us to control for
nuisance variables and test groups with minimal shared
histories and minimal communication. The task offers a
simple experimental platform for studying the general
problem of group coordination while maximizing group
returns, much like Prisoner’s Dilemma and the minority and
majority games offer simple experimental platforms for
studying the general problem of competition while
maximizing individual returns.
