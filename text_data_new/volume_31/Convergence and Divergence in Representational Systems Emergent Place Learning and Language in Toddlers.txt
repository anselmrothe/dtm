Abstract

are different neurological underpinnings, with the caudate
underlying egocentric strategies and the hippocampus
underlying place learning (Compton, 2004; Iaria et al,
2003). However, the way in which they are combined is
only beginning to be understood. This is an especially
interesting question in young children who begin
navigating when both their bodies and minds are changing
rapidly, allowing them unprecedented access to new ways
of physically and mentally interacting with the world.
A primary goal of this study was to use an adapted
Morris water maze to explore the nature of children’s
search strategies as place learning
emerges.
Developmentally, egocentric strategies appear first,
followed by landmark use (Acredolo & Evans, 1980;
Cornell & Heth, 1979). Even in early development young
children, like adults, can use a dynamic combination of
strategies. For example, 6-month-olds rely on egocentric
strategies to look for a previously viewed stimulus after
changing perspective 180 degrees, while 9- and 11month-olds use a mix of ego and allocentric responses.
However, when the salience of the target is increased, all
age groups shift to using more allocentric strategies
(Acredolo & Evans, 1980), suggesting that even as spatial
abilities emerge they are dynamically incorporated with
other spatial strategies. Significant changes in spatial
representation occur at 20-24 months, including the
emergence of place learning (Newcombe, Huttenlocher,
Drummey, & Wiley, 1998; Sluzenski, Newcombe, &
Satlow, 2004). For example, while 18 to 22-month-olds
are able to use dead reckoning to search for a hidden
object after a position change, only children older than 22
months can use external features to increase the accuracy
of their searches (Sluzenski et al., 2004).
From this
research it is clear that various search strategies come
online early, with place learning emerging at about 24
months of age. What is missing in the developmental
picture is a research methodology that can provide
descriptive data about children’s search strategies as place

representational systems in humans.

acquisition has been much studied, while the ontogeny of
spatial navigation is comparatively less well understood,
as is the relationship between early language and space.
This study explored emergent place learning and
language in 16- to 24-month-old children using a spatial
task adapted from the Morris water maze, and the
MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory.
Children were placed in a circular enclosure and a puzzle
was hidden under the floor at one location. Before each
trial children were disoriented and placed in the maze
from a different starting position. Their search strategies
and success at finding the puzzle were coded. Older
children demonstrated more spatial searching and more
goal-finding success, as well as greater overall
expressive vocabulary. Place learning and expressive
language both significantly correlated with age, but place
learning and language did not correlate with each other
once age was partialled, with one crucial exception: a
theoretically-predicted correlation between prepositions
and goal localization.
Keywords: Place learning; spatial language; spatial
development

Introduction
People navigate the world every day, utilizing various
spatial strategies.
There are two systems of such
strategies; egocentric (involving self-referencing), and
allocentric (using viewer-independent referencing).
Allocentric strategies include landmark use (identifying
features at or immediately near a goal) and place learning
(triangulating a location using relationships between distal
features). Evidence suggests that adults use both ego and
allocentric
strategies
dynamically,
preferentially
weighting each according to the task and context (Iaria,
Petrides, Dagher, Pike & Bohbot, 2003), and that there

learning comes online, elucidating patterns of variability
across individuals and age ranges in early navigation.
The Morris water maze is a place learning task that has
been used with adults and non-human animals to obtain
descriptive data regarding search characteristics across
age ranges (Moffat & Resnick, 2002) and under various
lesion conditions (Compton, 2004). In the standard water
maze, individuals are placed in a circular tank and
navigate to a platform placed invisibly under the surface.
Each trial begins from a different location, and success
requires calculating the location of the platform relative to
surrounding features in the room. Adaptation of the water
maze for young children allows us to narrow the gap
between the animal, adult human and infant literature.
Additionally, the adapted maze can provide detailed
information about children’s performance regardless of
their ultimate success in finding the target.
A second goal of this study was to explore the
relationship between early emergent space and language.
Traditional views hold that language and space can be
dissociated to a certain extent. However, there is also
reason to believe that language and space may be interrelated, with content dependent linkages that both
constrain and enable development. It has been argued
that the terms used to code space in one’s native language
can affect categorization and hence processing of nonlinguistic spatial representations (Levinson, Kita, Haun, &
Rasch, 2002; but see Li & Gleitman, 2002). Interestingly,
children who have Williams Syndrome (who have severe
spatial deficits yet relatively strong language) show
spatial-specific language deficits, that is, prepositions
(Landau & Hoffman, 2005; Phillips, Jarrold, Baddeley,
Grant, & Karmiloff-Smith, 2004). Developmentally, the
specificity hypothesis (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1986; 1987)
suggests that during the single word acquisition period of
language development there is a relationship between the
emergence of linguistic content types and related
cognitive skills, the idea being that both linguistic and
non-linguistic skills rely on similar foundational
knowledge and that as they come online they can have a
reciprocal effect on each other, influencing mutual
development. Thus, it was predicted in this experiment
that both place learning and language would show rapid
yet independent development, with the exception of
prepositions, which were predicted to correlate with place
learning.

A 10’ diameter child’s pool with 8” high inflatable sides
was covered with a double layer of 15” x 15” tarpcovered foam tiles. The foam underneath four tiles, one
per quadrant, was cut away to hide a puzzle containing
eight pieces that when correctly fitted made a sound (only
one location was used per participant). With the puzzle in
place the goal was visibly indistinguishable. The pool was
placed in a rectangular room with many features including
the door and other experimental apparatuses.
Expressive language was measured using the
MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory
(MCDI) short form for toddlers (ages 16-36 months).
This is a checklist that a parent fills out by noting which
of list of nouns (100), verbs (103), and prepositions (26) a
child spontaneously says.

Procedures
Children and their parents entered a waiting area to
complete consent forms and the MCDI. Subsequently
they entered a different room for the place learning
experiment.
Familiarization The purpose of familiarization was to
introduce children to the task and to give them experience
finding the puzzle in its specific location.
The puzzle
was placed on top of the goal tile. Children and the
experimenter entered the pool and played with the puzzle.
Next, the experimenter demonstrated hiding the puzzle,
then lifting the tile to find it, and encouraged children to
try.
Familiarization ended when children had
demonstrated that they understood that the goal was to
find the hidden puzzle by independently lifting the tile
and placing a piece at least twice.
Testing Testing consisted of four learning trials, (with
the puzzle hidden), one probe trial, (with the puzzle
removed), and one control trial (with the puzzle clearly
visible on top of the tile) to ensure that children were still
motivated. On each trial the experimenter took the child
and, while the parent walked to a different quadrant, spun
the child to disorient her. This combination of
disorienting children while the parent moved and
beginning each trial from a different location ensured that
children could not use dead-reckoning to find the puzzle,
but instead had to rely on true spatial navigation. The
parent took the child and set her down inside the pool
facing outwards with a puzzle piece, to search for the
puzzle. Children searched, by lifting tiles, for 60 seconds,
or until they found the puzzle. After each search the
experimenter replaced the tile, and children were allowed
to search any tile as many times as they liked in a trial. If
children did not find it, the experimenter showed the
puzzle briefly, so that children could approach, lift the
tile, and place the piece. Note that every trial ended with

Experiment
Participants
Participants were 32 children aged 16-24 months (M=20.4
months), 14 boys and 18 girls, approximately equally
distributed. Five participants were discarded due to
fussiness or failure to continue searching, and five due to
technical issues such as camera failure.

the child finding the hidden puzzle, with or without a cue,
and only data was included from children who completed
every trial this way. This served as a control to ensure
that children understood the task and were still motivated
to find the puzzle. After children found the puzzle,
parents walked back around the pool to lift their child out
while the experimenter re-hid the puzzle. Then the
experimenter took the child back to the pool’s center to
start the next trial. Some children did not tolerate being
held by the experimenter, in which case the parent spun
the child while the experimenter walked to the starting
point. The parent and experimenter then exchanged
places, and the parent placed the child in the pool.
Additionally, some children required their parent to step
just over the side of the pool during the trial.

spatial search that was neither under the child nor
someone else). (See figure 1).

with “x” marking the goal.

Data Coding
Expressive Language The number of nouns, verbs, and
prepositions was tallied, and summed for a total
vocabulary score.

Although search types were exclusive within category
(e.g. a search next to the goal was coded as adjacent not
peripheral), a choice could be double-coded across
categories, (for example a search could be both spatial
adjacent and non-spatial egocentric.)
Scores were
summed for each type across all four learning trials and
converted into percentages by dividing by the total
number of searches.

Place Learning Place learning was measured by whether
a child correctly located and lifted up the target square, to
reveal the puzzle hidden underneath (maximum once per
trial). A place learning (PL) score score was calculated
for each child by adding the number of times the child
found the puzzle and dividing by 5 (total number of
trials).

Results
Place learning and age

Search Types To further explore spatial development,
the relationship between age, place learning, and search
characteristics was explored. Data on search types from
the first four learning trials was used, since on the probe
trial failure to find the puzzle in its expected location may
have resulted in children differentially interpreting what
was expected of them. A modified place learning (mPL)
score was calculated using the number of times children
located the goal divided by 4 (number of learning trials).
Children varied widely in walking speed, and often
stopped and started intermittently during a trial. Because
of this inconsistency, time measures were not utilized.
Instead, children’s discrete search choices (indicated by
lifting a tile) were categorized. Each trial consisted of
potentially multiple discrete searches as children lifted
tiles before finding the target square. Each search before
finding the target in every trial was coded as one of five
types, in two general categories, spatial and non-spatial.
Spatial types were peripheral (searching under a tile
approximately the same distance from the perimeter of the
pool as the goal), or adjacent (searching under a tile
immediately adjacent to the goal). Non-spatial searches
were social (lifting the tile under another person),
egocentric (lifting the tile under self) or unrelated (a non-

A primary question was whether older children were
significantly better at place learning than younger.
Participants were divided at the median into two age
groups, 16- to 19 month-olds, (M=17.6, SD=1.3) and 20to 24-month-olds (M=23.0, SD=1.4. A one-way Anova
(age) revealed a significant effect of age on place learning
(F (31)= 10.484, p=.003), and % non-spatial searching
(F(31) = 11.27, p=.002) and a marginal effect of age on %
spatial searching (F(31)=3.82, p=.06). (See figure 2).

search types with age. Note *p<.05, **p=.06

To explore search types across development more closely,
to determine if children showed similar gains across time,
an Anova was done using smaller age divisions. The
resulting groups were 16-month-olds, (M=16.27, N=6),
17-to 18-month-olds (M=17.27, N=6), 19- to 20-montholds (M=19.64, N=6), 21- to 22-month-olds (M=22.35,
N=5), and 23- to 24-month-olds (M=23.96, N=9.)
Despite small subject sizes, a one-way Anova (age)
revealed a significant effect of age on place learning, %
spatial searching and % non-spatial searching. Percentage
of non-spatial searches showed a significant linear
decrease (F(1,4)=12.94, p=.001) with age. The % spatial
searching showed both a linear increase (F(1,)=8.56,
p=.005) and quadratic increase (F(1,4)=3.04, p=.05) as a
function of age, reflecting an initial rapid increase in
spatial searching between the 16 month and 17- to 18month-old age groups within an overall linear trend (See
figure 3).

These results suggest that with age children show a
decrease in non-spatial strategies and an increase in
spatial strategies and place learning. Interestingly, the
shift in spatial strategies at about 17-months precedes
actual goal finding, since it is not until about 20 months of
age that children were able to reliably find the puzzle on
multiple trials.

Age, Place learning, and Language
Correlational analyses were conducted to explore the
relationship between age, spatial development and
language, with total number of searches partialled out to
ensure that older children did not experience greater
success simply from lifting more tiles. There was a
significant relationship between age, goal finding, spatial
searching and language with a negative relationship
between age and non-spatial searching (see Table 1).
Although place learning and language were correlated,
(r(29)=.59, p<.01) when age was partialled out the
correlation dropped to non-significance (r(28)=-.15,
p=.44, suggesting that both place learning and language
undergo rapid parallel, yet independent, development.
Although even 24-month-olds have not yet achieved
adult-like proficiency in either place learning or language,
there is a clearly rapid acquisition in both domains over a
very short developmental time period.
To further explore this relationship, goal finding, spatial
search types, and language subtypes were correlated,
partialling out age and total number of searches. There
was a significant relationship between spatial searches
and place learning, and a negative relationship between
non-spatial searches and place learning (see table 2).

Only adjacent searches correlated with goal finding
(r(27)=.38, p=.04), while peripheral and equivalent
searches did not, supporting the idea the idea that goal
finding relied on using distal cues to narrow searches to
the correct area of the pool. The lack of relationship
between place learning and language subtypes was of
particular interest, especially given the lack of
relationship between place learning and total language.
As predicted, place learning significantly correlated with
prepositions, but not with any other language subtype,
supporting the idea that place learning and spatial
language bear a unique developmental relationship to
each other.

maturation, experience-dependent behavioral changes,
and other cognitive development. For example, older
children can and do navigate more independently than
younger children, as do more securely attached vs. less
securely attached children, which can affect their
understanding of space (Hazen & Durrett, 1982;
Clearfield, 2004). In fact, the wide variability observed
within the same age groups (for example some 24-montholds never found the goal, and one 17-month-old found it
three times) provides intriguing evidence that the
developmental process may be impacted by multiple
factors, and this picture is only beginning to be
understood.
Language and place learning showed significant yet
non-correlated development occurring from 16- to 24
months. The exception was prepositions, the acquisition
of which was correlated with place learning. Often
language and spatial representation are considered to be
largely dissociable systems, yet evidence exists to suggest
that there are key areas of overlap. Given the methods
utilized here it is not possible to know the directionality of
this relationship, if indeed there is a clear uni-directional
relationship rather than a mutual interactive one.
Interestingly, all but one of the children who used
prepositions also found the goal at least once, but many of
the children who found the goal had no prepositions,
suggesting that if the relationship is directional it is that
spatial understanding influences spatial language. Future
studies incorporating more direct language measures are
needed to further explore this question. At minimum, the
correlation between prepositions and place learning
suggests that representations that rely on understanding
spatial relationships between objects emerge in two very
different cognitive systems behaviorally (as evidenced in
successful goal searches) and linguistically (as evidenced
in prepositions) on a developmentally related timescale.
The finding here, of a spatial specific language linkage,
presents an intriguing story about the interaction between
various cognitive systems, beginning early in
development, in fact, as early as either place learning and
expressive language can be measured.

Discussion
In this study, 16- to 24-month-old children’s place
learning skills were tested on an adapted Morris water
maze, to explore the emergent nature of place learning
and the relationship to expressive language development
as measured on MCDI. Previous research has suggested
that children undergo a rapid change in spatial
representation skills at approximately 20 months of age, a
finding that was verified in our current study.
Interestingly, place learning itself, that is, the ability to
find the goal, was preceded by a drop in of use non-spatial
search strategies and an increase in use of spatial.
Children as young as 17 months showed a sharp increase
in spatial strategy use compared to 16-month-olds.
Remarkably, this shift did not initially result in goal
finding and hence reflects a change that arises early and
persists unrewarded before it becomes effective. Most
models of learning, like reinforcement learning, rely on
some type of feedback (Sutton & Barto, 1990). The
exception, associative learning, is characteristic of the
hippocampus (McNaughton, 1993). Therefore it remains
an intriguing question whether the shift results from
endogenous neurological changes including early
hippocampal maturation, or rather external factors not
measured here. In fact, it is likely the spatial changes are
due to a number of converging factors including brain

Future Directions
The findings from this study reveal complex early
language and spatial systems in toddlers. Although it is
clear that by 24-months of age toddlers are able to
somewhat use place learning to find a hidden goal
location, it is not clear how they are able to access and
weight information in the environment and integrate it
with other spatial and egocentric information for efficient
way-finding. Therefore, further work needs to be done to
examine how children variably weight different
information sources throughout development as their
place learning skills become more mature and reliable. In
addition, further work needs to be done to more closely
explore the spatial and language relationship found here,
incorporating direct language measures rather than relying
on parental report tools, like the MCDI. Finally,
longitudinal studies need to be conducted to explore the
stability of individual differences in a variety of linguistic
and spatial paradigms across development
