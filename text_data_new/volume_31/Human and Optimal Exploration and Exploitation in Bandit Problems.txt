Abstract: We consider a class of bandit problems in which a decision-maker must choose between a set of alternativeseach of which has a fixed but unknown rate of rewardto maximize their total number of rewards over a short
sequence of trials. Solving these problems requires balancing the need to search for highly-rewarding alternatives with
the need to capitalize on those alternatives already known to be reasonably good. Consistent with this motivation,
we develop a new model that relies on switching between latent exploration and exploitation states. We test the
model over a range of two-alternative bandit problems, varying the number of trials, and the distribution of reward
rates. By making inferences about the latent states from optimal decision-making behavior, we characterize how
people should switch between exploration and exploitation. By making inferences from human data, we attempt
to characterize how people actually do switch. We find some important regularities in and similarities optimal and
human decision-making, but also some interesting individual variation. We discuss the implications of these findings
for understanding and measuring the competing demands of exploration and exploitation in decision-making.
