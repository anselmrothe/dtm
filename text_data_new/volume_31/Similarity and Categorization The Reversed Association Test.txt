functional independence as evidence for a multipleprocesses view, and then introduce Dunn and Kirsner’s
reversed association theory as a tool to assess the
relationship between task performance and cognitive
processes. A statistical method for evaluating reversed
association will be presented, and three empirical studies
and one computer simulation investigating the dissociation
between categorization and similarity will be described. As
readers will see, our study implicates a strong possibility
that similarity and categorization judgments rely on some
unshared cognitive processes, and suggests that the reversed
association test is an important and practical method to
examine the dissociation of the processes underlying two
related tasks.

Abstract
The reversed association theory (Dunn & Kirsner, 1988)
provides a powerful procedure for studying the link between
cognitive processes and task performance. It helps find
whether two behavioral tasks involve the same or different
cognitive processes. However, this theory has not been fully
utilized. Finding reversed association requires a large, single
study consisting of at least six independent manipulations.
Furthermore, the statistical procedure to verify reversed
association has not been fully developed. This article presents
practical solutions for these problems by investigating the
recent controversy over categorization and similarity
judgments. First, a contrast analysis is illustrated in a case
study to statistically verify reversed association. Second,
empirical experiments and computer simulations are
presented to verify the reliability of the reversed association
test. Combined together, this study reveals that there is a nonmonotonic relationship (i.e., reversed association) in
performance for categorization and similarity judgment tasks.

Dissociation in Similarity and Categorization
Judgment

Keywords: Similarity, Categorization.

The key evidence for Sloman’s two systems of reasoning
comes from the behavioral discrepancy underlying
categorization and similarity judgments (Sloman, 1996).
Rips (1989) provided some of the first empirical evidence
for this dissociation. His main argument is that some
independent variables affect categorization but not
similarity judgments, and vice versa (i.e., functional
independence). For example, modifying an internal feature
did not change the perceived similarity between original and
transformed animals, whereas modifying a surface feature
did change the perceived similarity between original and
transformed animals. In contrast, modifying an internal
feature changed the category membership of original and
transformed animals, whereas modifying a surface feature
did not change the category membership of original and
transformed animals (Rips, 1989). By manipulating central
features (Kroskaand & Goldstone, 1996), necessary features
(Thibaut, Dupont, & Anselme, 2002), causal features (Ahn
& Dennis, 2001), and the frequency of features (Rips &
Collins, 1993), other studies demonstrated analogous
dissociations.
All of these studies were designed to examine functional
independence between categorization and similarity
judgments. In the categorization task, participants judged if
a target item belonged to one of two designated categories.
In the similarity judgment task, participants judged if a
target item was similar to one of two designated categories.
Participants’ responses were analyzed in a 2-alternative
forced-choice setting. Two option categories were pitted
against each other, so that the selection of one category
reflected an operation of one cognitive strategy (e.g.,

Introduction
This article examines the cognitive processes underlying
categorization and similarity judgments. Although similarity
has been known to play a central role in category formation,
the role of similarity in categorization has been questioned
lately (Hahn & Ramscar, 2001; Hampton et al., 2007). On
the empirical side, a number of studies have demonstrated
functional
independence
between
similarity
and
categorization judgments. Some feature information that
affects a categorization task is nonetheless ineffective in a
similarity judgment task, and vice versa (see Han &
Ramscar, 2001). On the basis of this discrepancy, several
theorists have proposed that categorization relies on
multiple processes – a similarity-based associative process
and a rule-based abstract process (Sloman, 1996).
However, this view has been severely criticized on two
fronts. First, the empirical evidence for the multipleprocesses view of categorization also turned out to be
consistent with a similarity-based single process view
(Nosofsky & Johansen, 2000; Pothos, 2005). Second, the
evidence supporting the multiple-processes view is
primarily based on the notion of functional independence, 1
which by itself is not very informative in linking cognitive
processes and task performance (Van Orden, 2001). Thus, it
is unclear whether similarity and categorization tasks are
mediated by the same or different process(es).
In this article, I apply the reversed association theory
developed by Dunn and Kirsner (1988) and investigate the
relationship between categorization and similarity. In what
follows, I will first illustrate the problems with interpreting

124

attending primarily to causal features) over the other (e.g.,
attending equally to causal and non-causal features).
The problem with testing “functional independence” is
that its interpretation is not always straightforward. For
example, hypothetical data like those shown in Figure 1
may indicate functional independence between two tasks.
However, these response patterns can emerge from the two
tasks that are different only in their decision thresholds.

Figure 2: Two logistic regression functions simulating two
2AFC tasks (similarity vs. categorization tasks). The error
terms of the two logistic functions are distributed normally
with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.15. The 8000 dots
shown in (a) and (b) represent hypothetical results from
8000 subjects performing one of the two tasks at a given
level of the independent variable (the x-axes). (c) and (d)
represent “results” from two hypothetical experiments.
Assume that these functions represent the data collected in
two tasks – a similarity judgment task (Figure 2a) and a
categorization task (Figure 2b). The x-axes of Figures 2a
and 2b represent a hypothetical variable (e.g., the strength of
a particular feature dimension) varying from 0 to 100. The
y-axes of the figures represent the proportion of selecting
one category (e.g., Category A) over the other (Category B)
in a similarity task (Figure 2a) or in a categorization task
(Figure 2b). The two functions differ only in their decision
thresholds. Figure 2b is obtained by shifting Figure 2a by 18
units along the x-axis, and the slopes of these graphs are
identical.
Even in this simple setting, a semblance of “functional
independence” can emerge from a manipulation of an
experimental design. For example, similarity performance is
affected by var 1 and var 2 (e.g., modifying surface
features), whereas categorization performance is less
affected by the same manipulation (Figure 2c). In contrast,
the categorization task is affected by var 1’ and var 2’(e.g.,
modifying an internal feature), whereas similarity
performance is less affected by the same manipulation
(Figure 2d).
This simple observation suggests that a variant of
functional independence can emerge even when two tasks
differ in their decision thresholds (e.g., one task requires
more conservative responses than the other). In other words,

Figure 1: A hypothetical example of functional
independence. In (a), the performance for a similarity task,
but not a categorization task, is affected by a manipulation
of surface features. In (b), this relationship is reversed. By
measuring the relative impacts of the two types of features,
a crossed interaction effect can be obtained – (c). For
example, in (c) the impact of a superficial feature is larger in
a similarity task than in a categorization task. In contrast,
the impact of an internal feature is larger in a categorization
task than in a similarity task.
Consider the following logistic regression functions

procedure comparing several independent studies is
illustrated. Second, to test the presence of reverse
association statistically, a contrast analysis is presented.

demonstrating functional independence is important, but not
sufficient in determining whether two tasks stem from the
same or different cognitive process(es) (Hampson, 2007;
Henson, 2006 for a similar argument).

Study 1: A reversed association test
The purpose of this case study is to illustrate a statistical
procedure to test reversed associations in a series of
manipulations made in three independent studies. In one of
Rips’s (1989) original experiments, participants received a
description of an unknown animal called “sorp,” and made
either a similarity or categorization judgment. Participants
in the similarity condition judged whether a “sorp” was
more similar to a bird or an insect. Participants in the
categorization condition received the same stimulus
material, but they judged if the same sorp was more likely to
be a bird or an insect.
Rips’s original study consisted of a 2 (categorization vs.
similarity judgment tasks) x 2 (accidental vs. essential
transformation) factorial design (Rips, 1989, pp.38-42). This
design does not allow us to assess the non-monotonicity of
the two tasks. In Study 1, we added one more condition to
his study, and investigated reversed association in a 2
(categorization vs. similarity judgment tasks) x 3 (accidental
vs. essential vs. no-cause conditions) between-subjects
design.
The stimuli were 3 different descriptions of an unknown
animal called “sorp” whose attributes were later modified in
three different ways: accidental, essential, or no-cause. In
the Rips study (1989), “sorp” originally had attributes
consistent with “birds” (e.g., “has two wings” and “lives in a
nest high in the branches of a tree”), but later developed to
display characteristics of insects (e.g., “grows two more
pairs of legs and clinging upside down to the undersides of
tree leaves”). The transformation was caused by hazardous
chemicals – the accidental condition – or by a some genetic
process – the essential condition.
The accidental and essential conditions in this study were
taken directly from the original Rips study. In the other
condition, the no-cause condition, the transformation of the
animal was described but the actual cause of the
transformation was unspecified.

two tasks – (a), and reversed association in task 1 and task 2
– (b).
Dunn-Kirsner’s Reversed Association Test
Unlike functional independence, Dunn and Kirsner’s
(1988) reversed association theory is free from such
confusion. The theory is extremely powerful, because it
makes only a minimum assumption between a task and a
process. In a nutshell, the theory suggests that if the
performance for two tasks is not monotonically related, then
the two tasks are not mediated by the same process.
For example, in Figure 3, consider three independent
manipulations (e.g., manipulating feature information) with
respect to two tasks (e.g., similarity and categorization
tasks). If the three manipulations change the performance
for task 1 monotonically, then the same manipulations
should also change the performance for task 2
monotonically (either in an increasing or decreasing fashion
– Figure 3a), provided that the two tasks are based on the
same process. A violation of this monotonicity is called
“reversed association,” and it offers strong evidence for the
idea that two tasks are not identical in their cognitive
processes (Figure 3b) (a summary of a proof is presented in
the Appendix A, and see also Dunn & Krisner, 1988 for
details).
Despite its theoretical significance, the reversed
association theory has not been fully utilized. The problem
is its applicability. First, finding reversed association
requires at least 6 different conditions (three independent
variables applied to two tasks) in a single experiment. It is
difficult to implement such a large scale study in many
instances (e.g., neuroimaging studies). Second, it is unclear
how to verify reversed association statistically. For example,
a graph like the one shown in Figure 3b indicates a reversed
association, but how can it be verified statistically?
In the next case study, I propose a practical solution for
these problems. First, to overcome the need to implement

Reversed association test
This section illustrates a meta-analytic procedure to
investigate whether the three manipulations implemented
separately in the three sets of the study would affect
similarity and categorization performance. To examine the
impact of the three variables, we first calculated the
proportion of selecting one “designated” category in each
study. The designated category in this case study was
participants’ selecting “birds” over “insects.” We then
calculated the extent to which these proportions exceeded a
chance level performance of 0.5 in Z-scores. These Z-scores
were converted to effect size r and Fisher Z to compare the
three independent studies. A contrast analysis was applied

126

to assess the overall trend of the influence of the three
manipulations. The specific procedure applied in this
analysis is as follows:
(a) For the three studies, the proportions of selecting one
designated category over the other were calculated. The
extent to which the observed proportion p exceeds a chance
level performance of P0 =0.5 was translated into Z-scores

Materials & Procedures The stimuli were presented on a
piece of paper, on which one of the three different
descriptions of “sorp” was shown (accidental, essential, or
no-cause descriptions). Participants first read the
description, and then answered either a categorization or

for a few words.

In the three conditions, the unknown animal initially had
features consistent with birds and then came to possess the
features consistent with insects. The transformation of the
bird- to insect features was triggered by an accident
(exposure to hazardous chemical waste) in the accidental
condition and by a genetic process in the essential condition
(Rips, 1989). In the no-cause condition, no specific cause of
the transformation was described.

the bias stemming from the distribution of r as r becomes

Figure 4 is a graphical representation of the effect sizes
generated by the three types of descriptions (accidental,
essential, and no-cause). As Figure 4 reveals, a reversed
association effect is apparent. An application of a linear
contrast indicates a significant linear trend in the similarity
judgment task; z = 3.40, p < 0.001, but not in the
categorization judgment task; z = 0.87, p = 0.38. In contrast,
a significant quadratic trend was evident in the
categorization judgment task; z = 3.55, p < 0.001 but not in
the similarity judgment task; z=0.56, p >0.5.
These results demonstrate a significant linear trend in the
similarity task and a significant quadratic trend in the
categorization task. However, care should be taken to
interpret these results because we do not know the reliability
of this statistical procedure. Specifically, if the test still
yields a significant reversed association (a significant linear
trend in one task and a significant quadratic trend in the

other task) even when the two tasks are separated merely by
response thresholds (see Figures 2a and 2b), the test would
be unreliable. In this regard, it is important to scrutinize the
false alarm rate of this test procedure.

Parameter a in (7) corresponds to the slope of the function
(see Figure 5a), and -b/a corresponds to the point at which
the probability of selecting one category is equal to the other
(P(cate_A)=P(cate_B)=0.5). I call this point “the inflection
point” of a function.
Figure 5b shows two logistic regression functions with
two different inflection points.

thresholds applied in similarity and categorization tasks, we
generated 200 random pairs of inflection points (–b/a) with
a restriction that the parameter -b/a ranged from 0 to 100.
To simulate responses made by individual participants, error
terms were added to the two functions and 4000 random
data points were generated for each of the two functions
(Figure 5c).

Study 2: Estimating the false alarm rate of
the reversed association test
In Study 2, we conducted 30,000 simulated experiments and
examined the false alarm rate of the reversed association
test. Specifically, we estimated the probability that
statistically significant reversed associations would occur
when two tasks were identical except for their response
thresholds (i.e., a false alarm rate: False alarm rate = P(A |
B), where A = statistically significant reversed associations:
B = two tasks differ only in their response thresholds).
The basic procedure of this simulation study was as
follows: (1) selecting one logistic regression function from a
pool of three, and then modifying it with two different
response threshold parameters (Figure 5a and 5b); (2)
introducing three intervals (the intervals represent three
experimental conditions, such as the accidental, essential,
and no-cause conditions in Study 1) to the two functions
(Figure 5c); (3) randomly selecting 30 data points from each
interval and applying the reversed associated test to the
data; (4) repeating this procedure 30,000 times with
different parameters, and measuring how often statistically
significant reversed association would occur in these 30,000
simulated experiments. If the false alarm rate of the reversed
association test is high, then the test is not be very useful.

The error terms were assumed to be normally distributed
with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.15. To simulate the
three variables implemented in each experiment (e.g.,
accidental, essential, and no-cause conditions in Study 1),
we dividend the x-axis into 10 intervals ranging from 0 to
100 (see the x-axis of Figure 5c), and randomly selected 50
triads of intervals with the following restrictions:
0<interval_1< interval_2< interval_3<100.
Thirty samples were selected randomly from each
interval, from which the effect sizes were calculated, and
contrast analyses employing linear and quadratic weights
were implemented. This procedure was applied to three
different logistic regression functions with three different
slopes (a=0.1, 0.06, 0.04, and see Figure 5). A “statistically
signification reverse association effect” was measured by
the presence of a significant linear contrast in one task and a
significant quadratic contrast in the other task. To assure
that our statistics did not miss indications of false alarms,
we set the alpha level to be particularly lenient; alpha = 0.1
(one tailed).
In summary, this simulation study employed the
following steps. Step 1: we selected one logistic regression
function from a pool of three and generated 200 pairs of
functions that had different response threshold parameters (b/a); Step 2: 50 different randomly selected triads of
variable intervals were implemented to every pair of the
functions and 30 random samples were taken from each

Method
This simulation study assumes that people’s binary
responses, such as selecting one category from two options
(e.g, birds vs. insects), can be modeled by a logistic
regression function. A logistic regression function is defined
by two parameters, its slope and inflection point.

general pattern of reversed association (e.g., by means of
plotting) and then apply the statistical test.
(b) The two tasks should be compared in a tightly
controlled condition. Subtle differences in the procedures,
participants, instructions and stimuli are likely to result in
significant differences in the performance for the
categorization and similarity judgment tasks. In this regard,
the two tasks should be compared under a tightly controlled
uniform condition whenever possible.
(c) The test does not identify the underlying “processes”
that separate two tasks. The reversed association test is
useful to detect the “dissociation,” but the test does not tell
what “process” contributes to the dissociation. In other
words, the test cannot identify the cause of the
“dissociation.”

Results
The estimated false alarm rate of the reversed association
test was quite small. We found only one occasion (out of
30,000 simulated experiments) in which the test resulted in
a significant reversed association. To assure that the low
false alarm rate did not come from the arbitrary selection of
the parameters, we conducted additional studies. First, we
raised the alpha level from 0.10 to 0.15. Second, the
standard deviation of the error term was also changed from
0.15 to 0.20. Even with these modifications, the false alarm
rate remained the same.

Discussion
The results from the two studies have shown that the
reversed association test could be a promising tool in
detecting the dissociation between two tasks. But in order to
use this tool effectively, it is crucial to know its limitations.
This section summarizes important limitations of the
reversed association test.
(a) This is NOT a necessary and sufficient test. The
purpose of assessing linear and quadratic trends in two tasks
is to statistically verify monotonic and non-monotonic
relationships in two tasks. Assessing a liner trend is one
way of capturing the monotonicity of a function; however,
there are many nonlinear monotonic functions
(e.g., y  x ). This means that when the test does not show
significant effects, it can NOT be concluded that there is NO
reversed association between two tasks. In this sense, it is
important to show first whether the data conform to the
