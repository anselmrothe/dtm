many interconnected variables. Von Clausewitz’s (1832)
two principles underlying all strategic planning, i.e., utmost
concentration of sources and utmost speed, are essential in
WINFIRE. An action-oriented strategy is expected to lead
to success.
In order not to favor cultures that prefer making fast
decisions, we also chose COLDSTORE (Dörner, 1996),
which does not require the same urgency and quick
response. In COLDSTORE, the participant has to monitor
temperature changes to regulate or maintain an ideal of 4°
Celsius (39° Fahrenheit). COLDSTORE can be described as
moderately dynamic since decisions have delayed effects,
high in opaqueness as the delayed effect of actions is not
obvious, and low in complexity as it only consists of three
variables. A cautious, less action-oriented strategy is
expected to lead to success. This characterization of the
microworlds was confirmed through participants’ subjective
ratings (Güss et al., 2004).

Abstract
Previous research on complex problem solving (CPS) has
been conducted mostly in western-industrialized countries
and has often focused on individual differences such as
intelligence to explain performance. We tested a model
postulating that cultural values influence CPS strategies and
CPS strategies in turn influence performance when
controlling for individual difference variables. Participants
were 535 students in five countries: Brazil, India, Germany,
the Philippines, and the United States. They had to protect
cities from fires and prevent goods from perishing in two
microworlds with different demands. Fit indexes show
reasonable fit of the theoretical model in the two
microworlds. Results highlight the influence of culture on
CPS.

Microworlds
Imagine you are the commanding officer of a fire brigade.
You have several trucks and helicopters to protect three
small villages surrounded by forests. Imagine you are the
manager of a supermarket responsible for a coldstore full of
dairy products. Suddenly, the automatic temperature device
breaks down and you have to manually control the
temperature to keep products from spoiling.
We presented the fire and coldstore problems as computer
simulations WINFIRE (Gerdes, Dörner, & Pfeiffer, 1993)
and COLDSTORE (Reichert & Dörner, 1988) to
participants from Brazil, India, Germany, the Philippines,
and the United States.
The goal of this study was to test a theoretical model
postulating that cultural values predict problem-solving
strategies and performance in these two simulations with
different demands. Such simulations are also called microworlds (Brehmer & Dörner, 1993) and are commonly used
in the field of complex problem solving (CPS) and dynamic
decision making (DDM). The advantage of microworlds is
that they represent aspects of problems in real life, such as a
situation’s complexity and dynamic development, as well as
opaqueness of some aspects, yet they offer the possibility
for controlled laboratory studies (Frensch & Funke, 1995).
We chose the two simulations WINFIRE and
COLDSTORE because of the different challenges they pose
to the problem solver. In WINFIRE, the participant has to
make quick decisions under time pressure in order to
extinguish and contain fires. WINFIRE can be characterized
as highly dynamic with many changes occurring, low in
opaqueness as it shows on the screen most of what is
happening, and medium in complexity because it consists of

Culture and Complex Problem Solving
Previous research on CPS has been conducted mainly in
western-industrialized countries and has often focused on
individual difference variables like intelligence (e.g.,
Gonzalez, Thomas, & Vanyukov, 2005) and computer
experience (Schaub, 2001) to explain performance variance.
Recently, researchers recommended more focus on CPS
strategies (Schoppek & Putz-Osterloh, 2003).
Surprisingly, as Weber and Hsee (2000) stated, the study
of how culture influences problem solving and decision
making has not received much attention. Psychinfo shows
16 peer-reviewed articles from 1984 to 2008 for the three
keywords culture, decision making, and cognition. Although
cultural research on reasoning, concepts, and inferences has
increased in recent years (e.g., Medin et al., 2006; Nisbett,
2003), the study of culture and decision making and
problem solving is still in its infancy.
Culture can be understood as implicit and explicit
knowledge shared by a specific group of people and
transmitted from generation to generation. A strong
influence from culture might be expected as cultural
environment has a significant impact on problem-solving
knowledge. Indeed, some studies have shown cross-cultural
differences in CPS (e.g., Strohschneider & Güss, 1999).
Thus, the goal of our study was to assess both individual
difference variables and CPS strategies and their influence
on performance in different cultures.
Values are an aspect of cultural knowledge relevant to
this study because they can be understood as abstract,
transsituational goals that may act as guiding principles for

1942

the selection of specific strategies in complex and novel
problem situations.
This study focused on two value dimensions
individualism–collectivism and power distance (e.g.,
Hofstede, 2001). Those two dimensions were assessed in
four different relatively independent value preferences in
previous studies: Horizontal individualism (HI), vertical
individualism (VI), horizontal collectivism (HC), and
vertical collectivism (VC). HI favors equality and focuses
on oneself; VI accepts inequality and focuses on oneself;
HC favors equality and focuses on the group; VC accepts
inequality and focuses on the group (Singelis, Triandis,
Bhawuk, & Gelfand, 1995; Triandis, Chen, & Chan, 1998).
Previous research has shown that individualistic values were
related to more planning and to a more action-oriented
problem-solving strategy (Mann et al., 1998). Collectivist
values were related to more caution and risk-avoidance and
less action orientation (Ohbuchi, Fukushima, & Tedeschi,
1999). Low power distance was related to a higher desire for
actions in decision making (Brockner et al., 2001).
The following analyses were intended to test the
theoretical assumptions summarized in the path model (see
Figure 1): 1) HI would be positively associated with action
orientation, 2) VC would be negatively associated with
action orientation, 3) Action orientation would mediate the
relation between values and performance, 4) Action
orientation would be positively associated with performance
in WINFIRE and negatively with performance in
COLDSTORE, 5) Planning would be positively associated
with performance in WINFIRE, 6) Computer experience
and intelligence would predict strategies and performance in
both WINFIRE and COLDSTORE.

Method
Participants
Participants were 535 students from two different
universities in each of the following countries: Germany (n
= 104), the United States (n = 133), Brazil (n = 97), the
Philippines (n = 104), and India (n = 97). Students were
from the schools of arts and sciences, social sciences, and
business. Samples were comparable according to course or
major and gender. Females made up 63% of all participants.
The age range was 18 to 49, with an average age of 22.1
years (SD = 4.44). None of the participants had taken part in
other CPS experiments prior to this study.
To test for possible within-country variability, we
compared the performance in the two microworlds between
the participants of the two universities in every country.
None of the differences was significant (ps < .11).
The countries were selected based on their differences in
the two value dimensions studied. Germany and the United
States have high individualistic values, Brazil and the
Philippines have high collectivist values (Hofstede, 2001),
and India has both individualistic and collectivist values
(Sinha & Tripathi, 1994). The Philippines and India have
high power distance, Brazil has medium, and the United

States and Germany have low power distance values
(Hofstede). Data were not complete for every participant
due to computer problems, brownouts, no shows, and
missing data on some survey items.

Instruments
Language. The questionnaires and instruction sheets for the
microworlds were originally developed in English then
translated from English into German and Brazilian
Portuguese using the translation-backtranslation method.
Translators were the trilingual author and graduate-level
bilingual students in every country. As Indian and Filipino
participants were bilingual and the mode of instruction was
mostly English, the questionnaires were administered to
them in English.
Cultural values. Horizontal and vertical collectivism and
individualism were assessed with a Likert scale attitude
measure developed by Singelis et al. (1995) consisting of
eight items for each of the four dimensions, for example, “I
prefer to be direct and forthright when discussing with
people” (HI). The reliabilities were not ideal, but were
similar to those of Singelis et al. and other studies (e.g.,
Kurman, 2003). We conducted confirmatory factor analysis
for the four factor solution receiving the following
goodness-of-fit indices: χ2=1717.48 (df = 458), p < .001,
χ2/df = 3.75, GFI = .815, Std RMR = .086, RMSEA = .077,
NNFI = .79. The fit indices are similar to those of Singelis
et al., although they do not indicate adequate fit with the
data. To assess construct validity, we also assessed HI, HC,
VI, and VC with a decision scenario instrument consisting
of 16 scenarios (Triandis et al., 1998). Correlations between
the two scales were .22 for HI, .17 for VI, .24 for HC, and
.36 for VC (ps < .001). These correlations were always
higher than the correlations with the other subscales, thus
indicating acceptable construct validity. We did not include
the decision scenario instrument of Triandis et al. in further
analyses because it yields nominal data and psychometric
properties are not accessible in the literature or in our study.
WINFIRE. Performance in WINFIRE was measured by the
percentage of protected area during each of its 111 cycles.
In our study, the Cronbach alpha values for protected forest
in cycles 42, 54, 90, and 111 was .80 for the overall sample.
Overall, participants saved 52.33% (SD=11.69) of the forest
at the end of the game. Without any intervention or
commands from the firefighting commander, 45.18% of the
forest would have been saved. Two strategies were
identified from participants’ saved computer files: action
orientation, i.e., the total number of units moved during the
entire microworld, indicating problem solving for the
various fires; planning, i.e., the strategic distribution of
trucks and helicopters even before the first fires started.
COLDSTORE. Performance in COLDSTORE was
measured by the total deviations from the goal temperature.
In our study, the Cronbach alpha values for the performance

1943

variable in cycles 33, 66, and 100 was .84 for the overall
sample. The fewer deviations from the goal temperature, the
more successful the participant was. Action orientation was
operationalized as total number of control wheel
adjustments. It was not possible to operationalize planning
adequately from the saved computer protocols.
Possible demographic covariates. Among other demographic variables, we also assessed years of computer
experience due to its possibly variation across cultures and
due to previous findings (Schaub, 2001).
Nonverbal intelligence. Additionally, the Test of
Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-3; Brown, Sherbenou, &
Johnsen, 1997) was administered. The TONI was selected
because it is relatively culture-free and it assesses nonverbal aspects of intelligence related to problem solving.
The TONI-3, which takes about 15 minutes to complete, is a
language-free test that assesses abstract reasoning and
problem solving with 45 abstract-figural items assessing, for
example, classification, analogous reasoning, induction,
deduction, and detail recognition. The test has been
validated in various ethnic groups and with several other
intelligence tests. Retest reliabilities ranged from .79 to .95,
and Cronbach alpha values were in the .90s (Brown et al.).

Procedure
The author collected data in the five countries over a 3-year
period with an on site team in each country. Data were
collected in group sessions (2 hours) and individual sessions
where the WINFIRE and COLDSTORE microworlds were
administered (2 hours). In the first meeting, participants
filled out the demographic questionnaire, the two value
surveys, and the TONI-3. In the individual meeting, each
participant played WINFIRE and COLDSTORE and
answered surveys regarding the microworlds. Instructions
for each microworld were provided and test games were
played before the actual microworld started. Each
microworld lasted 12 minutes. All the decisions participants
made were automatically saved to computer files.

Results
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations,
correlations, and reliabilities were analyzed (due to space
limitations correlations cannot be shown). Table 2 shows
means and standard deviations of all variables for the
overall sample and for all cultural samples. One-way
between-groups ANOVAs were conducted to test for
cultural differences among the variables. The five countries
differed in all variables significantly (ps <.001).
Comparison of grand mean centered values data confirmed
the postulated differences between countries.

Pan-cultural Path Analyses
Path analysis as a variant of structural equation modeling
(SEM) was conducted using Mplus (Muthen & Muthen,
1998-2006). The compatibility of the specified model and
the observed data were evaluated for both the WINFIRE and
COLDSTORE models as strategy and performance
variables differed between them. The Maximum Likelihood
method was used to estimate path coefficients in the models.
To evaluate the path models, several fit indexes were used
following criteria guidelines on the interpretation of the
indices (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
The overall pan-cultural unconstrained model for
WINFIRE presented in Figure 1 shows adequate fit indices:
χ2(4) = 10.32, p = .04; CFI = .968, TLI = .833, RMSEA =
.054, and SRMR = .016. The proportion of the variability in
action orientation explained by specific values (HI, VI, HC,
VC), computer experience, and intelligence is 12% (R2 =
.116, p < .001). The proportion of variability in planning
explained by specific values (HI, VI, HC, VC), computer
experience, and intelligence is 9% (R2 = .091, p < .001).
Moreover, the proportion of the variability in WINFIRE
performance that is accounted for by action orientation,
planning, computer experience, and intelligence is 12% (R2
= .123, p < .001).
The overall unconstrained model for COLDSTORE
presented in Figure 2 shows very good fit indices: χ2(4) =
4.10, p = .39; CFI = 1.000, TLI = .999, RMSEA = .007, and
SRMR = .010. The proportion of the variability in action
orientation explained by specific values (HI, VI, HC, VC),
computer experience, and intelligence is 12% (R2= .124, p <
.001). The proportion of the variability in COLDSTORE
performance accounted for by action orientation, computer
experience, and intelligence is 40% (R2=.409, p < .001).
In WINFIRE, HI predicted action orientation positively
and HC predicted it negatively. In COLDSTORE, VC
predicted action orientation. In both models, computer
experience and intelligence predicted strategies and
strategies predicted performance. As expected, in
COLDSTORE, more actions led to more deviations from
the target temperature, i.e., worse performance. Computer
experience predicted performance only in COLDSTORE,
and intelligence predicted performance only in WINFIRE.

Path Analysis for Each Country
The models for the two microworlds were tested in all
cultural groups separately. Overall, data fit the models
reasonably well, indicating that the theoretical models hold
in different cultural contexts (see Table 3). In WINFIRE,
however, the German and Filipino TLI and RMSEA
indicated inadequate fit with the data. In COLDSTORE, all
but the German model showed excellent fit.

Multiple Group Analysis

planning, computer experience to performance, intelligence to performance, and planning to activity. In COLDSTORE, only the two paths from computer experience to
activity and intelligence to activity differed significantly in
more than two comparisons.

Path analyses with multi-group comparisons were then
conducted to investigate the extent country moderated the
relations specified in the models. Constrained and unconstrained models were compared. First we constrained all
paths, but not the means and variances of the dependent
variables, i.e., strategies and performance, as we expected
cultural differences. Chi-square results were compared to
the original model’s chi square, and the significance of the
difference was tested. Results from these analyses showed
significant differences between constrained and unrestricted models in WINFIRE, χ2D (52) = 77.42, p = .01, and
COLDSTORE, χ2D (28) = 38.33, p = .09.
In addition, we investigated which paths differed significantly between countries conducting pairwise comparisons
for the 17 paths in WINFIRE and the 9 paths in COLDSTORE. Results showed at least two cross-country differences on seven paths in WINFIRE: from HC to activity,
computer experience to activity, VI to planning, VC to

Discussion
The goal of this study was to test a theoretical model
postulating that values influence strategies and strategies
influence CPS performance in two different situations.
Both WINFIRE and COLDSTORE models manifested a
notable fit with the data for the overall pan-cultural model
and for the models of each country (with the exception of
the German models and the Filipino WINFIRE model). Six
specific predictions for the path model were made:
1) HI would be positively associated with action
orientation: Results showed that HI was only significantly
related positively with performance in WINFIRE.

2) VC would be negatively associated with action orientation: Results showed that while HC and VC were negatively related to action orientation in WINFIRE, VC was
positively related in COLDSTORE, contrary to our prediction. Paths did not differ significantly among countries,
which could be related to task characteristics and the finding that collectivistic values lead to low action orientation
in complex microworlds. The COLDSTORE microworld
is not complex, yet is non-transparent. Participants with
high VC values may feel comfortable dealing with nontransparence, leading them to be more active.
3) Action orientation would mediate between values and
performance: Analyses showed that action orientation
mediated the influence of HI and HC on performance in
WINFIRE and VC on performance in COLDSTORE.
4) Action orientation would be associated positively with
performance in WINFIRE and negatively in COLDSTORE: Results supported this prediction.
5) Planning would be positively associated with performance in WINFIRE: Results supported this prediction.
6) Computer experience and intelligence would predict
strategies and performance in both WINFIRE and COLDSTORE. Consistent with previous studies, computer experience (Schaub, 2001) and intelligence (Gonzalez et al.,
2005) were influential and predicted strategies in both microworlds in the expected direction, but not consistently.
Path coefficients showed that strategies predicted performance better than computer experience and intelligence,
showing the relevance of studying strategies in CPS as
Schoppek and Putz-Osterloh (2003) suggested. CPS is a
key ability for adapting to changes in the material and social environment. The environmental and social demands
from which problem-solving strategies develop differ between cultures. Our study addressed specific aspects of
culture that could be related to particular CPS strategies.
Notwithstanding potential limitations related to sample
and method, the present study makes important advances
in understanding cultural influences on CPS performance.
The two models tested in this study provide support for a
novel theoretical claim that abstract cultural values related
to perception of self and others affect CPS strategies, in
turn affecting performance. As the variance accounted for
by particular strategy values was not too high, further research is needed to investigate other cultural variables that
could influence CPS strategies and performance.
