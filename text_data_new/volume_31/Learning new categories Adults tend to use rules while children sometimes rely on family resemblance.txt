Abstract
We conducted an experiment in which children and adults were
asked to learn a set of categories for which a single-feature rule
(the criterial attribute) or overall family resemblance would allow for perfect performance. Test stimuli were presented after
the category was learned and were designed such that the information provided by the rule conflicted with the information
provided by the family resemblance structure. We found that
adults made significantly more rule-based responses to the test
stimuli than did the children. These data suggest that although
adults default to verbal rules under standard learning conditions, children may rely instead on an implicit, non-verbal system to learn the same categories.
Keywords Category Learning; Development; Multiple Systems

Categorization is a fundamental skill that has been studied
not only in adults but in children as well (Ashby & Maddox, 2005; Ashby, Alfonso-Reese, Turken, & Waldron, 1998;
Minda, Desroches, & Church, 2008; Smith, 1989). Existing research on the cognitive differences between children
and adults suggest that children and adults will perform similarly when learning some kinds of categories, but will exhibit specific differences when learning others. First, relative
to adults, children have a reduced working memory capacity
(Gathercole, 1999; Swanson, 1999). This means that in cases
where category learning relies on working memory, children
should not perform as well as adults. However, when learning
a new category does not tax working memory (or the involvement is minimal), children and adults will perform similarly.
Second, relative to adults, children have a generally reduced
capacity for executive functioning and rule selection (Bunge
& Zelazo, 2006; Casey, Giedd, & Thomas, 2000; Frye, Zelazo, & Palfai, 1995; Zelazo, Frye, & Rapus, 1996). This
means that when category learning depends on rule selection,
children should be impaired relative to adults. This impairment should not be present when the categories to be learned
have little or no rule selection component.
The idea that working memory and executive functioning
play a role in the learning of some categories but not in others
is one of the central predictions of a multiple-systems theory
of category learning called Competition of Verbal and Implicit Systems, or COVIS (Ashby & Maddox, 2005; Ashby

et al., 1998; Ashby & Ell, 2001; Minda et al., 2008; Waldron
& Ashby, 2001; Zeithamova & Maddox, 2006). This theory
suggests that at least two brain systems are fundamentally involved in category learning. The verbal system is assumed
to learn rule-described categories. These are categories for
which the optimal rule is relatively easy to describe verbally
(Ashby et al., 1998). For example, consider a category set in
which round objects belong to one group and square objects
belong to another group. These categories could be quickly
mastered by the verbal system because a rule is easy to verbalize (“category 1 items are round”). According to COVIS,
the verbal system is mediated by the prefrontal cortex and it
requires sufficient cognitive resources (working memory and
executive functioning) to search for, store, and apply a rule
(Zeithamova & Maddox, 2006). Furthermore, this system is
assumed to be the default approach for normally-functioning
adults learning new categories (Ashby et al., 1998).
However, not all categories can be easily described by a
verbal rule. COVIS also assumes that an implicit system
learns non-rule-described categories. These are categories
for which no easily verbalizable rule exists or for which two
or more aspects of the stimulus must be integrated at a predecisional stage (Ashby & Ell, 2001). That is, the dimensions themselves may be perceptually separable, but they
might need to be combined or integrated in order to make
a categorization decision. For example, consider a familyresemblance category in which most of the objects are small,
most are round, most are reddish, and most are shiny. The
objects in this category share an overall family resemblance
with each other, but there is no single feature to act as the
rule. The rule, “most are small, most are round, etc.” is difficult, though not impossible, to verbalize. COVIS assumes
that a category like this can be learned more accurately and
efficiently by the implicit system, without relying on a verbal
rule.
The implicit system is thought to be mediated by subcortical structures in the tail of the caudate nucleus. It relies on
a dopamine-mediated reward signal to learn categories and
does not rely heavily on working memory and controlled attention. The process of learning in the implicit system is assumed to be a gradual process of associating the perceptual

1518

aspects of an object with the correct response. As a result,
this system is well-suited to learn categories that have a strong
family resemblance structure (Ashby et al., 1998).
Both of these systems are assumed to operate in normallyfunctioning adults, and both can contribute to performance,
even after learning has progressed. In general, COVIS assumes that the two systems can compete during learning and
when a classification decision is made, but that the system
with the more successful responding strategy will eventually
dominate performance (Ashby et al., 1998). For instance, although the verbal system is considered the default system for
adults, some categories may not be easily learned by a verbal
rule. In this case, the implicit system would produce more
accurate responses and would take over. Also, if rule-based
categories are learned under conditions in which the learner
is distracted and working memory is being used for another
task, the implicit system would take over for the struggling
verbal system (Minda et al., 2008; Zeithamova & Maddox,
2006).
Because COVIS makes specific assumptions about the
brain regions involved in the two types of category learning,
there are clear predictions to be made about developmental
effects on category learning. Recent work has suggested that
the prefrontal cortex develops later than other areas (Bunge
& Zelazo, 2006; Casey et al., 2000). Furthermore, verbal
working memory and executive functioning develop substantially during childhood and are related to these physical developments in the prefrontal cortex (Gathercole, 1999; Swanson, 1999). Since the prefrontal cortex is assumed to mediate the verbal system, COVIS predicts that children should
be impaired relative to adults when learning categories that
rely heavily on this verbal system, particularly when learning requires substantial working memory resources (e.g., categories for which the optimal rule is a complex verbal rule).
On the other hand, the implicit system of COVIS is mediated
by the tail of the caudate nucleus. This structure seems to be
fully developed in children (Casey et al., 2004), and as a result, young children should be able to learn non-rule-defined
categories as well as adults. Furthermore, because this system does not require working memory resources (Zeithamova
& Maddox, 2006), the learning of non-rule defined categories should not be impacted by developmental differences
in working memory.
This prediction was recently tested by Minda et al. (2008)
who examined the learning of categories by children ages 3,
5, and 8 years old, as well as adults. Relying on a subset of
the categories sets of Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961),
Minda et al. found that children performed worse than adults
on categories that were optimally learned by a disjunctive rule
but that children and adults performed the same on family resemblance categories. However, children as young as 5 were
able to learn single-dimensional rules about as well as adults,
suggesting that the verbal system and the ability to learn rules
was not completely absent in children.
Although these results were generally consistent with the

predictions of COVIS, several issues necessitate additional
research. First, COVIS makes an explicit assumption about
the competition between the two systems. The verbal and
the implicit systems compete to learn the categories and provide the response (Ashby et al., 1998). Although Minda et al.
found that children learn rule-defined categories less well that
adults, they used categories for which only one strategy was
viable. A more interesting case concerns categories for which
rule-based and non-rule-based strategies might be available.
Adults should default to the verbal system and should base
classifications on a verbalizable rule, even if the rule conflicts
with overall similarity. However, it is not clear how children would perform in this case, although COVIS predicts
that they should be less likely to make rule-based classification because they would have difficulty inhibiting a response
to the conflicting information. Second, the subjects in Minda
et al’s study were evaluated on their performance in learning new stimuli, but not in their ability to transfer what they
learned to new stimuli. Stimulus generalization is an important aspect of categorization, and COVIS predicts that adults
should continue to apply rules to new stimuli, but it is not
immediately clear how children would behave (even if they
learned a rule).

Experiment
Our experiment examined category learning by a group of
five-year old children and a group of university students. We
asked them to learn two five-dimensional categories that had a
verbal rule that defined category membership, and also had an
overall family resemblance structure. This category set could
be learned perfectly by the verbal system, using a verbalizable
rule based on a single dimension (i.e., the criterial attribute,
referred to as the CA) that was perfectly predictive of category membership. This category set could also be learned
perfectly by the implicit system using a strategy based on
the family resemblance (FR) of members within each category on all five dimensions. Since the areas that mediate the
verbal system (the prefrontal cortex) are less well developed
in children, we predict that children will be less likely than
adults to find the CA. However, since the areas that mediate
the implicit system (the basal ganglia) are fully developed by
age five, we predict that there will be little impairment on
learning the FR structure. Therefore, although we expect that
children and adults will learn the categories equally well, we
expect that they will do so using different systems and different strategies.
The experiment featured a transfer phase in which subjects
provided a classification for a set of novel stimuli for which
the evidence provided by the CA conflicted with the evidence
provided by the family-resemblance structure. We predicted
that since adults would rely on the verbal system to learn the
rule, they would classify these items in accordance with the
CA. We expected some children to also classify these stimuli
in accordance with the CA, but we also predicted that because of the less-well developed verbal system, many chil-

1519

dren would classify the test stimuli in accordance with the
FR evidence or would have difficulty using a consistent classification strategy because of the conflict.

Category A

Category B

Method
Subjects Subjects included 28 children with a mean age of
5.21 years (SD = .62 years) recruited from the University of
Western Ontario’s YMCA Child Care Centre and Laboratory
Preschool. Of the 28 children who participated in the study,
three failed to complete the category-learning task. Data from
eight additional children was discarded because their performance on the last block of category learning was not significantly higher than chance performance. This left 17 children
(11 boys, 6 girls) who showed evidence of category learning. Subjects also included 21 students from the University
of Western Ontario who participated in the study for course
credit. Data from four adults was discarded because their performance on the last block of category learning was not significantly higher than chance performance. This left 17 adults
(4 men, 13 women) who showed evidence of category learning.
Materials Subjects learned to classify drawings of bugs
that varied along five binary dimensions: antenna (forwardfacing or backward-facing), head (circle or square), wings
(rounded or pointy), legs (bent or straight), and tail (bent or
straight). A complete set of stimuli is shown in Figure 1. The
category set was made up of 10 objects with five objects belonging to each of two categories. The binary structure for
Category A and Category B is shown in Table 1. The values
1 and 0 indicate the assigned feature values for each of the
five dimensions. For example, round head, forward-facing
antenna, rounded wings, straight legs and a straight tail were
each be assigned a value of 1, and the complementary set of
features were assigned a value of 0. The item 1 1 1 1 1 represents the prototype for Category A and the item 0 0 0 0 0
represents the prototype for Category B while the remaining
category members have four features in common with their
own category’s prototype and one feature of the opposite category’s prototype. Note, the fist dimension is the CA. The feature that corresponded to the CA was counterbalanced across
participants. Perfect categorization performance can be attained by learning the CA (e.g. “round heads in Category A,
otherwise Category B.”) or by learning the FR structure.
Transfer stimuli were used to distinguish between CA and
FR categorization strategies. That is, the feature corresponding to the CA indicated membership in one category but the
overall family resemblance indicated membership in the opposite category. As shown in Table 1, the first dimension of
the first transfer stimulus (0 1 1 1 1) was consistent with CA
evidence for category B, but the overall FR evidence is consistent with the evidence for Category A.

computer. Children were first told that they would be playing
a game in which they would see pictures of different creatures on the computer screen. They were told that some of
these creatures lived in the mountains and some lived in the
forest. Their job was to help these creatures find their homes
by pointing to the correct place on the screen.
The learning stage of the experiment consisted of five
blocks in which each of ten possible training stimuli was presented in random order, once per block, for a total of 50 trials.
On each trial, a picture of a creature appeared in the middle of
the screen and pictures of the two category labels (mountains
or trees) were shown in the top left and right corners of the
screen. As well, ten small white circles were centered along
the top of the screen. On each trial, the child indicated the
creature’s category label and the experimenter clicked with
the mouse. If the response was correct, the creature moved to
the correct category label and smiled for three seconds. If the
response was incorrect, the creature moved to the incorrect
category label and frowned for three seconds then moved to
the correct category label and smiled for three seconds. Each
time a trial was completed, regardless of whether it was correct or incorrect, one circle at the top of the screen turned red.
After ten trials, when all of the circles were red, the circles
all became white and a new set of ten trials began. The circles were used as a tool for participants to keep track of their
progress through the experiment. Pilot work suggested that
these progress circles offered a mild incentive for children to
complete the experiment. Minda et al. (2008) used stickers
for a comparable effect.
Upon completion of the 50 trials, children were told that
they would be seeing some additional creatures and that they
would be helping them to find their homes. They were told
to classify these new creatures using what they had learned
during the training phase. The transfer stage consisted of
one presentation of each of 10 transfer stimuli presented once
in random order. Each trial followed the same sequence of
events as in the training stage except that novel creatures were
presented (see transfer stimuli in Figure 1) and no feedback
was given (although the stimuli smiled when they moved to
the selected location).
At the start of the experiment, subjects were asked to indicate to the experimenter if they did not wish to continue,
though the experimenter tried to be as encouraging as possible to keep the children interested in the game. Children were
allowed to take a short break at any point during the experiment in which they were allowed to colour. All children were
given a short break at the end of the learning stage of the experiment. Adults were tested using the same basic procedure
as the children except that adults were tested on individual 17
inch iMac computers in a room with up to three other participants. Adults read instructions on their own and completed
the task without the aid of an experimenter, using a mouse to
select their responses. As well, adults were not specifically
told to take a break between the learning stage and the transfer stage, although they did take a break at least long enough

to read the transfer instructions.

Results
Learning Analysis We first examined the learning of these
categories by both groups of subjects. For children and adults,
the average proportion correct for each block of 10 trials was
calculated. The resulting learning curves for children and
adults are shown in Figure 2A and these data suggest a small
early advantage for adults over children but they also show
that both groups learned the categories well. A 2 (age) x 5
(block) mixed ANOVA revealed a main effect for block, F
(4, 128) = 23.30, p < .001, illustrating that learning occurred
between the first and fifth blocks. No main effect was found
for age, F (1, 32) = 2.38, p = .13, and no interaction was found
between age and block, F (4, 128) = .27, p = .90, indicating
that children and adults did not differ in how well they learned
these categories. Despite the age difference and the reduced
capacity of the verbal system in the children relative to the
adults, there was little evidence that the children had any special difficulty learning these categories. However, since these
categories could be learned by either a family resemblance
strategy (via the implicit system) or a rule-based strategy (via
the verbal system), any differences in learning strategy should
be revealed in an analysis of the transfer stimuli.
Strategy Analysis In the transfer stage, the stimuli were
designed so that a categorization strategy based on the criterial attribute would result in placement of a stimulus in one
category and other categorization strategies, such as a family
resemblance strategy, would result in placement of a stimulus in the opposite category. In order to analyze performance on the transfer phase, we calculated the proportion of
criterial-attribute responses for each subject. These data are
shown in Figure 2B and this graph shows that adults tended to
make more classifications based on the criterial attribute than
did children. A t-test comparing the proportion of criterialbased responding confirmed this difference, t (22) = 2.99, p
< .01. Despite learning as well as adults, children used strategies such as similarity-based responding more frequently than
adults.
The figure also shows individual performances, and shows
that while most (though not all) adults made classifications
that were rule based (100% CA Performance), a different pattern emerged for the children. Although some of the children did appear to learn the rule, many more did not. And
some classified the test stimuli in exactly the opposite way
(0% CA), suggesting that they may have relied on the family
resemblance to do so. The figure also indicates some variability in the nature of non-CA performances (the individual dots). In the transfer stage, a person using an imperfect
single dimensional rule would appear to have a proportion
of criterial attribute responding of .2. That is, using dimension 2 as a rule would result in making the same classifications as using the CA for the rule on two of the ten stimuli.
Accordingly, each participant’s pattern of responses during
the transfer stage was correlated with the response pattern

adults tended to responded according to a criterial attribute
strategy more often than children. A chi square tests confirmed that adults and children use different categorization
strategies, X 2 (2) = 7.22, p = .03.

In this Experiment we asked children and adults to learn a
set of categories that could be acquired by finding a singlefeature rule or by learning the overall family-resemblance
structure. We then asked them to classify additional test stimuli for which the rule information conflicted with the familyresemblance information. Although the children and adults
did not differ from each other in terms of how well they had
learned the categories, they did differ in their classifications
of the test stimuli. As we predicted, children were significantly less likely to classify the test stimuli according to the
criterial attribute rule than were the adults. These results echo
earlier developmental work on the holistic / analytic distinction in category learning, which found that children tended
to prefer overall similarity and adults tended to prefer rules
(Kemler Nelson, 1984). In addition, research using a similar
category set found that adults who were asked to learned the
categories in the presence of indirect feedback, or via incidental means were also less likely to find the criterial attribute,
possibly because there were not relying on their verbal systems (Kemler Nelson, 1984; Minda et al., 2008).
These results are also consistent with a multiple-systems
theory (Ashby et al., 1998; Ashby & Ell, 2001). COVIS predicts that the verbal system should learn these categories by
testing various rules and eventually applying a verbal description for the correct single-dimensional rule. Adults default to
this verbal system under most learning conditions (Ashby et
al., 1998; Minda et al., 2008; Zeithamova & Maddox, 2006),
and so they apply the rule to classify the test stimuli. However, the implicit system could also learn these categories by
relying on the good family resemblance structure. The family
resemblance structure is difficult to verbalize because of the
number of propositions in the verbal rules, but less difficult
to learn procedurally because of the straightforward relationship between features and responses. Children, unlike adults,
have more difficulty relying on the verbal system because the

1522

prefrontal cortex has not sufficiently developed to allow for
its full operation (Bunge & Zelazo, 2006; Casey et al., 2004).
Without the efficient use of the verbal system, the child is
less able to efficiently engage in hypothesis testing. As a result, children could still learn these categories, but many of
the children may have relied instead on the implicit system
to learn the categories and subsequent classifications on the
transfer stimuli were not likely to be based on a rule.
The verbal system relies on working memory and executive functioning to test and store hypotheses and rules. As
such, the category learning differences between children and
adults are consistent with other observed differences in working memory ability between children and adults (Gathercole,
1999; Swanson, 1999). Working memory plays a large role
in the verbal system and is required to learn categories for
which the optimal rule is verbalizable (Waldron & Ashby,
2001; Zeithamova & Maddox, 2006). Adult participants (but
children less so) rely on verbal working memory to help learn
these categories with the verbal system. Other research has
shown that younger children are more sensitive to the relational complexity of hypothesis-testing tasks (Andrews &
Halford, 2002; Bunge & Zelazo, 2006; Zelazo et al., 1996),
which is also consistent with our claims here.
Although we claim that the verbal system is less effective
in children, the results of our experiment suggest that it can
(and does) operate. Some of the children in this study were
able to learn rules, and many continued to make CA based
responses in the transfer phase. It is possible that some children did learn the rule, but were unable to resolve the conflict
during the transfer phase. This would be expected to happen
in children, since their prefrontal cortex areas are less well
developed (compared with adult) and they would have difficulty in inhabiting the response to the family resemblance
structure. Furthermore, Table 2 and Figure 2B, also reveal
some subjects who relied on other non rule-based strategies.
These other strategies could be a mixture of responses from
the two systems (some rule-based, some similarity-based) or
may also be imperfect exemplar-based strategies. At this
point our data do not allow a strong conclusion about this
subset of subjects and additional research is needed to understand the interaction of these two learning systems in general
and at different stages in development.
