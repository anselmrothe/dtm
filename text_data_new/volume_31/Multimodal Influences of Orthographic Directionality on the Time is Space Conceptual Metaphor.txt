Abstract
The present study aimed to test whether the “Time is Space”
conceptual metaphor is grounded on the sensori-motor
experience of reading and writing.
Two groups of
participants differing in their directional reading/writing
system (Spanish and Hebrew) carried out a time judgment
task on auditorily presented words referring either to the
past or the future. As expected, our results showed opposite
congruency effects in the two groups: Spanish participants
were faster responding to past words with their left hand and
to future words with their right hand, whereas Hebrew
participants showed the opposite pattern. However, contrary
to Santiago et al. (2007) with visual stimuli, we did not
observe a facilitation effect at the perceptual level: stimulus
location (left/right) did not interact with temporal meaning.
In two additional experiments, the saliency of the auditory
spatial frame of reference was increased, relative to the
visual spatial frame, by asking Spanish participants to
perform the task blind-folded. Under these conditions,
temporal meaning interacted with both stimulus location and
response side.

Introduction
If you ask an English native speaker to situate the Big Bang
on a horizontal timeline he will certainly point to the
leftmost part of it. The opposite should be true if you ask
him to point to the Big Crunch.
Santiago, Lupiáñez, Pérez, & Funes (2007) and Torralbo,
Santiago & Lupiáñez (2006) demonstrated that this left-past
right-future representation of time is psychologically real.
They asked Spanish participants to discriminate past and
future words (verbs and adverbs) presented to the left or
right on the screen by pressing a left or right key. They
observed facilitation effects both at perceptual and motoric
levels: past words were responded faster when either
response or presentation side was on the left and future
words when on the right.

This finding can be understood in terms of Conceptual
Metaphor theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). Its basic tenet is
that abstract concepts need to be grounded on more concrete
conceptual domains. According to this theory, all concepts
are based on sensori-motor experiences. The representation
of a concrete concept such as space is based on our direct
experience with space. However, the conceptualization of an
abstract concept is more complex. Time, like justice, love,
or happiness, cannot be touched, seen, tasted or smelled. To
be conceptualized, it is thought that they need to use
concrete concepts as structural donors.
It has been hypothesized that the sensory-motor
experience responsible for the left-past right-future
representation of time is related to the exposure of
participants to a left-to-right orthographic system. However,
Santiago et al (2007) and Torralbo et al (2006) did not test
this hypothesis by comparing left-to-right to right-to-left
readers.
Several perceptuo-motor tasks have demonstrated to be
sensitive to the reading and writing habits of the
participants. As an example, Nachson (1981) showed that
English compared to Hebrew and Arab native speakers were
more prone to reproduce series of objects from left to right.
Chokron & De Agostini (2000) observed that French
participants preferred pictures with a rightward direction
whereas Israeli right-to-left readers showed the opposite
pattern.
The influence of reading habits is also present on higherorder cognitive processes, such as those representing agentpatient relations. Maass & Russo (2003) and Dobel,
Diesendruck & Bölte (2007) showed that right-to-left
readers, compared to left-to-right readers, tended to
represent agents on the right side of patients. This mapping
is coherent with the normal agent-patient order of
appearance and the direction of writing because all the
languages used in these studies mainly use a SVO word
order (German, Italian, Arab, and Hebrew).
More akin to the concept of time are those few studies that
have investigated the relation of temporal sequences to
reading/writing directionality. Tversky, Kugelmass, &
Winter (1991) observed that whereas English participants

1840

represent graphically a day sequence from left to right
(breakfast, lunch and dinner), Arab and Hebrew native
speakers tend to do it the other way (dinner, lunch and
breakfast). Chan & Bergen (2005, exp. 3) compared English
and Chinese (left-to-right readers) to Taiwanese (right-toleft readers) participants in a similar task. The two first
groups preferred to arrange sequentially the events from left
to right, whereas Taiwanese participants showed a wide
variation, including a high proportion of right-to-left
arrangements. Fuhrman & Boroditsky (2007), with a less
reflexive task, showed that earlier and later in a sequence
facilitated left and right manual responses respectively for
English speakers and right and left responses respectively
for Hebrew participants.
All these cross-cultural studies suffer from some
methodological problems. First, with the exception of
Fuhrman & Boroditsky (2007), their task is likely to activate
a highly conscious problem-solving mode of thought, and
therefore, a wide variety of strategies. For this reason we
decided to use a highly implicit and automatic task.
Second, in these studies participants were asked to judge
relative order of events. We hereby aim to extend these
results to stimuli directly referring to the past or to the
future, by means of the use of conjugated verbs and
temporal adverbs.
Third, they all used the modality of vision, which is
involved in reading, mediating by hypothesis the construal
of the left-right spatial representation of time. It is possible
that the use of the visual modality in these tasks activates
the left-right mapping of time. So, we decided to use another
modality, audition. The fact that our participants did not
have to read the target words also rules out the possibility of
spatial biases being induced on the spot by the directional
action of reading itself.
Fourth, prior cross-cultural studies only investigated the
priming of motor responses, they did not look at how space
perception could modulate the semantic access of temporal
references, as in Santiago et al (2007). The present study
includes this factor.

Experiment 1
Participants from two groups differing in the direction they
first learned to read and write (Spanish vs. Hebrew) were
asked to judge the temporal reference of words, which were
auditorily presented either to the left or right ear (via
headphones), by pressing a left or right key.
We predicted that the auditory presentation of words
referring to the past or to the future would result in
congruency effects between temporal meanings and both
stimulus location and response side. At both levels, Spanish
participants should show facilitation for the association of
past with left and future with right, whereas Hebrew
participants should show the opposite pattern.

Participants
Twenty native Spanish speakers living in Spain (16 females,
one left-handed, mean age 22.3) and twenty-eight native

Hebrew speakers living in Israel (18 females, one lefthanded, mean age 26.9) took part in Experiment 1. They all
reported to have normal hearing.

Materials
We used the same list of words as in Torralbo et al (2006)
for the Spanish group, and their translation for the Hebrew
group: 24 words referring to the past (e.g., “hizo” - “‫ ”עשה‬“he made”) and 24 referring to the future (e.g., “hará” “‫ ”יעשה‬- “he will make”).
The word set comprised 18 verbs inflected in either past
or future tense, and 6 past and 6 future temporal adverbs
(e.g., “antes” - “‫ ”לפני‬- “before”). Eight further words were
used for the practice block. Spanish words and instructions
were recorded from a female native Spanish speaker, and
Hebrew words and instructions were recorded from a female
native Hebrew speaker. They were auditorily presented via a
Sony headphone set, model MDR-023. The task was
programmed in E-prime (Schneider, Eschman, &
Zuccolotto, 2002) and ran in an Intel Pentium IV PC
1.70GHz.

Procedure and design
The procedure for the Spanish and Hebrew groups was
identical with the only exception of location (Spain vs.
Israel) and language of the target words and instructions
(Spanish vs. Hebrew).
The headphone set was fixed on their head before the
experiment began. All instructions were given auditorily via
the headphones, and participants could press a key (“p” in
Spanish or “‫ ”פ‬in Hebrew) if they wanted the instructions to
be repeated. When participants were ready, they pushed the
space bar to start the experiment. First, a white fixation
cross was presented over a black background for 250 ms,
followed by a spoken word presented to the left or right ear.
Word location was completely orthogonal to temporal
reference. Participant’s task was to discriminate if the word
referred to the past or to the future by pressing “z” or “m”
keys in Spanish or their equivalent in Hebrew (“‫ ”ז‬or “‫”צ‬
keys). The fixation cross remained on screen during word
presentation and for a further 4000 ms or until a response
was detected. Before the beginning of the next trial, a blank
screen was presented for 1000 ms. Reaction time was
measured from the onset of stimulus presentation.
The experiment had two blocks, differing in the mapping
of the left and right keys to “past” or “future” judgments.
The order of blocks was counterbalanced over participants.
Within each block, each experimental word was presented
once on the left and once on the right location. Participants
were allowed to take a break between blocks.

Results
Errors occurred on 507 trials (5.5% of the trials). Correct
trials with latencies below 850 ms and above 3000 ms (334
trials, 3.84%) were considered outliers and also discarded
from the latency analysis. Two 2 (Group: Spanish or
Hebrew) X 2 (Temporal Reference: past or future) X 2

1841

(Target Location: left or right) X 2 (Response Location: left
or right) ANOVAs taking both participants (F1) and items
(F2) as random factors were used for the latency and
accuracy analyses. In the analyses by participants, Temporal
Reference, Target Location and Response Location were all
within-subject factors. In the analyses by items, Temporal
Reference was a between-items factor while Target Location
and Response Location were within-item factors. In both F1
and F2 analyses, Group was a between-subjects and items
factor.
There were somewhat more errors on future than past
words (F1(1, 46) = 3.41, p = 0.071; F2 < 1). Contrary to the
Spanish group, Hebrew participants tended to respond more
accurately on future than past words (F1(1, 46) = 8.91, p <
0.005; F2(1, 92) = 2.28, p > 0.1). No other main effects or
interactions were significant (Temporal Reference X
Response Location: F1(1, 46) = 1.67, p > 0.1; F2(1, 92) =
2.86, p = 0.094; all other ps > 0.1).
The ANOVA on latencies showed that Spanish
participants tended to respond faster than Hebrew
participants (F1(1, 46) = 3.56, p = 0.065; F2(1, 92) = 12.35,
p < 0.001). Main effects of Temporal Reference, Target
Location and Response Location were not significant (all ps
> 0.1). Responses were faster when the stimulus was
presented on the same side of the response (F1(1, 46) =
18.25, p < 0.001; F2(1, 92) = 18.83, p < 0.001). All other
interactions involving Target Location were far from
significance (with all Fs smaller than or near to 1). The
Group factor did not interact significantly with Response
Location (both Fs < 1) but it showed a trend to interact with
Temporal Reference (F1(1, 46) = 14.86, p < 0.001; F2 < 1).
Whereas Spanish participants responded faster to past tense
words, Hebrew participants gave faster responses for future
words. This was probably due to the fact that future in
Hebrew is marked by a prefix, allowing a faster recognition
of the temporal reference for these words. Past words tended
to be responded faster with the left hand and future words
with the right hand (F1 < 1; F2(1, 92) = 7.42, p < 0.01).
Of central interest for the purpose of this study, there was
a clear interaction between Group, Temporal Reference and
Response Location (F1(1, 46) = 5.16, p < 0.05; F2(1, 92) =
27.18, p < 0.001). Hebrew and Spanish participants showed
opposite patterns of congruency between response side and
temporal reference: Spanish participants showed the leftpast right-future congruency pattern, whereas Hebrew
participants responded faster with their left hand to future
words and with their right hand to past words (see Figure 1).
Planned comparisons demonstrated that this congruency
effect was significant for Spanish participants (F1(1, 46) =
4.571, p < 0.05; F2(1, 92) = 31.509, p < 0.001) whereas it
did not reach significance for Hebrew participants (F1 < 1;
F2(1, 92) = 3.097, p = 0.082).

Discussion
As predicted by the reading/writing hypothesis, when
compared to Spanish participants, Hebrew participants
showed a diametrically opposed pattern: they were faster
when responding past with their right hand and future with
their left hand, whereas the Spaniards replicated prior
observations by Santiago et al. (2007) and Torralbo et al.
(2006).
This facilitation effect shows for the first time that the
temporal meaning of auditorily presented words can activate
the left-right mapping of time. It also shows and that the
left-right mapping for words intrinsically referring to the
past and future is also linked to the participant’s directional
reading/writing system.
The fact that the congruency effect was weaker with
Hebrew native speakers is not a new phenomenon (Tversky
et al, 1991) and it may have two possible causes, at least.
First, the Hebrew writing system is not entirely right-toleft: single letters are normally written from left-to-right
(Lieblich, 1975), and so are numbers and music notation
(Braine, 1968).
Second, all our Hebrew participants were highly
proficient in English, which is a left-to-right language.
Nachson (1983), using other tasks sensitive to orthographic
direction, demonstrated that the introduction of English at
school (around the 7th grade) for Hebrew participants could
weaken the right-to-left bias and even reverse it.
A question remains: Why we did not obtain a facilitation
effect at the perceptual level, as observed with visual stimuli
in prior studies? (Santiago et al, 2007; Torralbo et al, 2006).
The observed congruency effect between Target Location
and Response Location (Simon & Rudell, 1967) rules out
the possibility that participants were unable to localize
sound sources. A possibility is that the perceptual
facilitation effect with temporal words is modality
dependent, but this would make difficult to explain our
facilitation effect for manual responses.
Working only within the visual modality, Carlson (1999)
demonstrated that various spatial frames are activated at the
same time and that they compete to serve as the spatial
frame of reference, often resulting in an inhibition of the
non-dominant spatial frame of reference. Lewald (2007)

1842

observed that participants were more accurate to localize
sounds when blindfolded, which was due to the fact that the
auditory spatial frame was not inhibited by the visual frame
of reference in that condition.
Therefore, it is possible that there is a competition
between the visual vs. auditory frames of reference for the
mental timeline mapping and that the dominant visual
spatial frame (Middlebrooks & Green, 1999) inhibits the
non-dominant auditory spatial frame of reference.
If this is true, increasing the saliency of the auditory frame
and decreasing the saliency of the visual frame should result
in a significant interaction between Temporal Meaning and
Target Location. Otherwise, this interaction should remain
non-significant.

Experiment 2
We tried to increase the saliency of the auditory spatial
frame of reference in a first group of participants by
presenting the words via two external speakers situated on
their left and right sides, instead of using headphones.
Moreover, in a second group, this manipulation was
supplemented by asking the participants to perform the task
blind-folded.
We wanted to investigate whether increasing the saliency
of the auditory spatial frame alone was enough to convert it
in the dominant frame or if it was necessary to decrease the
saliency of the visual spatial frame.

Participants
Participants were all native Spanish speakers divided into
two groups: thirty-six (31 females, three left-handed, mean
age 21.9) for the sighted group and thirty-eight (30 females,
four left-handed, mean age 22.5) for the blindfolded group.
They all reported to have normal hearing.

Procedure and design

responses to future words and right responses to past words
compared to the opposite (F1(1, 72) = 2.49, p > 0.1; F2(1,
46) = 13.05, p < 0.001) and this effect tended to be stronger
in the blindfolded group (F1(1, 72) = 1.06, p > 0.1; F2(1,
46) = 6.23, p < 0.05). The interaction between Group,
Target Location, and Temporal Reference approached
significance (F1(1, 72) = 3.36, p = 0.071; F2(1, 46) = 3.37,
p = 0.073), but planned comparisons for each group showed
no significant influences (all ps > 0.1). There was an
interaction between Target Location and Response Location
(F1(1, 72) = 4.38, p < 0.05; F2(1, 46) = 7.29, p < 0.01),
indicating that the sounds were localized. None of the other
interactions or main effects was significant (all ps over 0.1).
Latency analyses showed that sighted participants were
faster that blindfolded (F1(1, 72) = 3.79, p = 0.055; F2(1,
46) = 151.78, p < 0.001) and that past words were responded
to faster than future words (F1(1, 72) = 29.77, p < 0.001; F2
< 1). The Response Location by Target Location
congruency effect was replicated (F1(1, 72) = 4.98, p <
0.05; F2(1, 46) = 7.36, p < 0.01), and it tended to be greater
in the sighted group (F1(1, 72) = 2.86, p = 0.095; F2(1, 46)
= 3.75, p = 0.059). As for the Spanish participants in
Experiment 1, participants in Experiment 2 were faster to
respond with their left hand to past words and with their
right hand to future words (F1(1, 72) = 4.38, p < 0.05; F2(1,
46) = 7.29, p < 0.01). This pattern was enhanced in the
sighted group (F1(1, 72) = 1.18, p > 0.1; F2(1, 46) = 4.34, p
< 0.05).
The most important result of this second experiment was
the interaction between Temporal Reference, Target
Location and Group (F1(1, 72) = 4.18, p < 0.05; F2(1, 46) =
2.85, p = 0.098). Planned comparisons showed that the
interaction between Temporal Reference and Target
Location was significant only within the blindfolded group
(blindfolded: F1(1, 72) = 6.01, p < 0.05; F2(1, 46) = 4.57, p
< 0.05; sighted: both Fs < 1; see Figure 2).

Everything was the same as in Experiment 1, with the
following exceptions: headphones were replaced by two
external NGS (Sphere 2.0) speakers placed to the left and
right of the participants (1 m. away from the screen each)
and oriented in their direction. Participants in the second
group were blindfolded during all the experiment and the
experimenter helped them to get seated and finding the
response keys on the keyboard.

Results
Trials on which an error was made (903 trials, 6.36 %) and
correct trials with latencies below 850 ms and above 3000
ms (270 trials, 2.03%) were excluded from the latency
analysis. The design of the analysis of Experiment 2 was as
in Experiment 1, except that the Group factor now referred
to sighted and blindfolded participants and that it was a
within-item factor in the items analysis.
The analysis of accuracy showed a trend to make less
errors on future than past words (F1(1, 72) = 3.23, p =
0.076; F2 < 1). Congruent with the reading/writing
hypothesis, there were somewhat more errors on left

Discussion
Results of Experiment 2 were clear-cut. First, we replicated
the results observed in Experiment 1 with native Spanish

1843

speakers. Our participants showed a left-past right-future
facilitation of response codes.
Second, incrementing the saliency of the auditory spatial
frame combined with decreasing the saliency of the visual
frame of reference succeeded in revealing an auditory
spatial modulation of the semantic access for past and future
meanings. This result rules out the possibility that the
horizontal mental timeline is modality specific. It is
important to note that the use of external speakers instead of
headphones alone was not sufficient. It was necessary to
blindfold participants in order to make them rely on the
auditory spatial frame of reference.

General Discussion
Experiment 1 extended previous findings with temporal
sequences to words intrinsically referring to the past or
future. Such way of referring to time confirmed that the
directionality of the orthography a person first learned to
read can account for the directionality of the spatial
representation of time over the left-right horizontal axis: it
flows from left to right for Spanish and in the opposite
direction for Hebrew native speakers.
However, Experiment 1 also showed a weaker
congruency effect with Hebrew participants compared to
their Spanish equivalent. This could be accounted for the
fact that the Hebrew writing system is not entirely right-toleft and also for the fact that all our Hebrew participants had
learned and frequently used an orthographic system
(English) which proceeds in the opposite direction to that of
their first language (see the discussion of Experiment 1).
The fact that the left-right mapping of time is accessed in
the present studies through a sensory modality (audition) not
involved in its development suggests that this mapping is
linked to the abstract, amodal concept of time.
A theory proposed by Santiago, Román & Ouellet
(submitted) explains how routinary events, such as reading,
can affect the way mental models are constructed in order to
facilitate our understanding of abstract concepts like time.
When reading, events that occur earlier are also generally
mentioned earlier in the text (Levinson, 1983), which means
more to the left in a left-to-right orthography, and more to
the right in a right-to-left orthography. This spatial
positioning of events in the text would be transposed to a
coherent mental model representation.
This strategy can generalize to other left-to-right
mappings, like the arrangement of numbers (the so-called
SNARC effect, Dehaene, Bossini & Giraux, 1993), and the
arrangement of agents on the left of patients in drawings
(Chatterjee, Southwood & Basilico, 1997). In SVO word
order languages, agents normally occupy subject position,
whereas patients surface in object position (Bock, 1982). In
a left-to-right language, the result is that agents are normally
written more to the left and patients more to the right.
Maximally coherent mental models will arise when agents
and patients are placed in the same position they are
normally situated in the text. Reversals in these
arrangements are expected when the orthography runs in the

opposite direction (see Zebian, 2005, for numbers; Maass &
Russo, 2003, and Dobel, Diesendruck & Bölte, 2007, for
agent-patient organization).
Contrary to Santiago et al. (2007) with visual stimuli,
stimulus location in Experiment 1 failed to interact with
temporal meaning. Experiment 2 permitted to show that this
was due to a competition between visual and auditory
spatial frames of reference in which the auditory spatial
frame of reference was not salient enough to win.
Experiment 2 also showed that the visual frame of
reference is much stronger than the auditory spatial frame.
Even if the visual frame was not relevant to the task at hand
and the auditory frame was made more salient, the visual
frame still remained dominant. Only when the use of the
visual frame was completely prevented by asking our
participants to perform the task blindfolded, was the
location of the auditory stimulus able to interact with
temporal meaning.
To conclude, present results support the idea that time is
conceptualized as a horizontal left-right mental line, which
flows in a direction consistent with the direction of
reading/writing. They also support that this mental line is of
a central nature: it is not linked exclusively to either
perceptual or motoric codes, and it can be accessed through
both the visual and auditory modalities.
