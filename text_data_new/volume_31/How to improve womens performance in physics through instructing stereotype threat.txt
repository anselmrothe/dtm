Abstract

Stereotype Threat
Research into learning physics has repeatedly demonstrated
lower motivation and poorer performance for female students
than for male students. To attempt to reduce gender
differences in strategy use, flow, and performance we used a
stereotype threat manipulation. In a 2 x 2-design study
(instruction x gender) with 37 11th grade students (20 female)
we tested two groups: A control group and a stereotype
information group who were told the stereotype was invalid.
Both groups had to study a learning program in physics on
torque. Pre-tests included prior knowledge and initial
motivation. We recorded online exploration behavior to find
strategy indicators. After learning, the students took a
knowledge test. The results were consistent with our
hypothesis: Female students in the stereotype information
group reported a higher probability of success compared to
females in the control group; they employed more effective
strategies, experienced stronger flow, and demonstrated more
knowledge. Females in the stereotype information group did
not differ from males in either group.
Keywords: gender; learning; motivation.

Introduction
Not only in everyday life but also in empirical research
there are many reports that female students perform worse
than male students in mathematics and physics when
comparing grades or test results (Frey, Asseburg,
Carstensen, Ehmke, & Blum, 2007). When learning
outcomes differ, the variables which account for this may be
lying early in the learning process. Such variables for
example could be interest (Females are less interested in
mathematics and physics than men, e.g., Fredricks &
Eccles, 2002) or self-concept (Females believe that they are
not good at mathematics and science; Schütte, Frenzel,
Asseburg, & Pekrun, 2007). Since Steele and Aronson’s
(1995) introduction of the concept stereotype threat another
possible explanation has been that women are aware of the
prevalent stereotype asserting that they have low aptitude
for physics. This then leads them to perform poorly due to
fear of confirming that stereotype. The aim of our research
is to find further evidence as to which variables might
explain gender differences in physics performance.

In this study we will focus on the phenomenon of stereotype
threat as an explanation for gender-related performance
differences in physics. Schmader, Johns and Forbes’ (2008)
process model of how stereotype threat affects performance
can explain why groups perform more poorly if such a
stereotype is activated. They applied their model to
examples such as that African-Americans achieved lower
scores in intelligence tests when they had been told that the
test was diagnostic of their intelligence (Steele & Aronson,
1995). Schmader et al. argue that all situations of stereotype
threat activate three core concepts: the concept of one’s ingroup, the concept of the ability domain in question, and the
self-concept. If all three core concepts are in balance
(Heider, 1958) (e.g., My group, who are females, is good at
physics; I am like other females; I am good at physics) there
should be no threat. However, as soon as an imbalance
occurs (e.g., My group, who are females, is poor at physics;
I am not like other females; I am good at physics), the
individual has to resolve the imbalance. According to
Schmader et al. this imbalance creates negative thoughts
which absorb capacity from working memory and lead to
performance decrement.
However, once the group with the negative stereotype is
told that the stereotype is wrong, the imbalance should
disappear. To test this, Johns, Schmader and Martens (2005)
told female subjects about that their anxiety during a
mathematics test may be the result of a negative stereotype
and had nothing to do with their ability. This manipulation
lead to gender differences in mathematics disappearing. We
will use the same manipulation to attempt to reduce gender
differences in a physics task.

Learning Physics with a Computer Program
Females not only perform worse than males in physics, but
it is also claimed in learning with computers. However,
empirical results are inconsistent. Roy, Taylor, and Chi
(2004) found that male students retrieved more task-relevant
information in an online task than female students. In a
formatting task, Shapka and Ferrari (2003) could not find

1471

gender differences. Schaumburg (2004) reported gender
differences in knowledge about standard software if explicit
computer instruction was missing, but not after explicit
instruction. In our own study (Imhof, Vollmeyer, &
Beierlein, 2007) students had to redesign a Power Point
presentation. In this task male students could reconstruct
more features of the presentation than female students.
Female students who had to solve statistical problems with
an unknown statistics program solved fewer problems than
male students (Vollmeyer & Imhof, 2007). As a
consequence of our previous work, we wanted to study
gender differences in domains in which males outperformed
females, such as physics and computer learning. Through
the information that a negative stereotype against women
exists we wanted to reduce the gender differences.
However, we wanted to strengthen the effect through the
instruction to work against the stereotype threat.
To investigate what female students exactly do that is
different to male students, Püttmann (2008) asked students
to learn using a physics program on a computer. Compared
to a standard learning text a computer program offers the
advantage that we can track the learning behavior with a spy
program and thus can describe students’ strategies to learn
the content of the physics program. Another advantage is
that we can enrich the program with interactive graphics. A
meta-analysis by Höffler and Leutner (2005) demonstrated
that there is a medium positive effect of animation use on
learning performance.
In her own study, Püttmann (2008) collected variables
relevant to the cognitive-motivational process model
(Vollmeyer & Rheinberg, 1999, 2000) to describe possible
gender differences when learning with the physics program.
She found that male students reported a more positive
motivation before they began to learn (stronger interest,
higher probability of success) and also more flowexperience during learning. In addition, their way to use the
program and its interactive graphics differed from the
females’ use: Male students used the graphics earlier, more
frequently, and for longer periods of time. An analysis of
quality revealed a more effective use of the graphics for
male students. As a consequence, Püttmann found a strong
effect of gender on the final knowledge test. With the results
of this study in mind we predicted that these gender
differences will be reduced through a stereotype threat
instruction.
What we do not know is how such an instruction affects
male students. When male students read that there is a
stereotype claiming that males do better in physics, a
stereotype lift might occur. Although such an effect has
seldom been shown to be significant, Walton and Cohen
(2003) confirmed such a stereotype lift in a meta-analysis.
Therefore, we assumed that our instruction will also slightly
improve males’ performance compared to the not instructed
males. However, our main focus is on the females’ learning.

Predictions
The following hypotheses were stated for our study:

Hypothesis 1: Female students who learn that it is only a
stereotype that women perform worse in physics than men
have a more positive initial motivation than the female
control group. Specifically, we assumed their belief in
probability of success would increase. As the value or the
attractiveness of the task is not changed, interest in the task
should remain the same.
Hypothesis 2: Females in the stereotype group experience
more flow during learning than the female control group.
This may be due to the higher probability of success
assessment.
Hypothesis 3: Females in the stereotype group will have a
higher probability of success and therefore use the
interactive graphics sooner, longer and more efficiently than
the female control group.
Hypothesis 4: Females in the stereotype group acquire
more knowledge with the help of the physics program than
the female control group.
The hypotheses are only explicated for the women in our
population. We assume we would reduce the gender effect
for females but we leave open whether we can make it
disappear. Methodologically, we also would test null
hypotheses if we propose that females in the stereotype
group perform as well as males in the control group.
However, in the Results we will report comparisons
between males and females in the stereotype group.
Regarding the comparison between the male stereotype
group and the male control group, we expected a small, non
significant increase in performance as mentioned earlier as
being stereotype lift.

Method
Participants
Thirty seven 11th grade students (20 female, 17 male, age: M
= 16.9 years old) from two high schools, participated in the
study. The schools are situated in a small town near
Frankfurt, Germany, with a socioeconomically well-to-do
population. In our 2 x 2-design we had four groups: the
female stereotype group (n = 11), the female control group
(n = 9), the male stereotype group (n = 9), and the male
control group (n = 8). As this study is regarded as a
preliminary study we used small groups. As a consequence
we have only small statistical power and expect hardly
significant results. To reflect the magnitude of our results
we will provide Cohen’s d (1992) as recommended by APA
(2001). An effect size d > .20 is a small effect size, d > .50
is a medium effect size, and d > .80 is a large effect size.

Procedure
Participants had to study a computer-based physics program
on torque for thirty minutes. The computer program
contained five units with 12 interactive graphics (Wünscher
& Ehmke, 2002). None of the students were familiar with
the concept of torque, as this is not taught before the 11th
grade. The instruction for the stereotype groups included
information about the stereotype threat. After instruction but

1472

before beginning to work with the program, prior
knowledge and initial motivation (interest, challenge,
probability of success, anxiety, QCM, Rheinberg,
Vollmeyer, & Burns, 2001) were measured. We videotaped
navigation behavior while using the program to find
indicators for strategy. During learning, the students’ flowexperience was measured after each unit (FKS, Rheinberg,
Vollmeyer, & Engeser, 2003). After learning was
completed, we administered a knowledge test.

Material
Stereotype Threat Instruction. The independent variable
in our design was the stereotype threat instruction as used in
Johns’ et al. (2005). After the task instruction we added the
following sentence for the stereotype group: “It is important
to keep in mind that if you are feeling anxious while
working with the program, this anxiety could be the result
of these negative stereotypes that are widely known in
society and have nothing to do with your actual ability to do
well on the test.” We added that the women should make a
special effort to work against these stereotypes, but male
students should, of course, give their best as well.
Prior Knowledge on Torque. To control for prior
knowledge, we chose four items out of twelve from the
knowledge test which we presented at the end of the
learning session (see performance below). We measured
prior knowledge after the instructions had been given. The
final knowledge test was developed by Wünscher and
Ehmke (2002). The four selected items differed in difficulty.
Initial Motivation. After reading the instructions,
participants completed the QCM (Questionnaire of Current
Motivation, by Rheinberg, et al., 2001). This questionnaire
measures initial motivation on four factors. The answer
format is a seven-point scale.
(1) Probability of success is an aspect of motivation
that has been incorporated into models as early as Lewin,
Dembo, Festinger, and Sears (1944) and Atkinson (1957),
as well as being part of more recent theories such as
Bandura’s self-efficacy construct (1986), Anderson’s
ACT-R theory (1993) and Wigfield and Eccles’s
Expectancy-Value Model (2002). It is assumed that
learners, at least implicitly, calculate the probability of
success taking into account their ability and the perceived
difficulty of the task (example items: “I think I am up to
the difficulty of the task”, “I probably won’t manage to do
this task”).
(2) Anxiety can be partly interpreted as fear of failure in
a specific situation (Atkinson, 1957). This aspect is not
the opposite of high probability of success, as it can be
high for learners who are in a social situation in which
they do not want to fail even though they expect to
succeed (example items: “It would be embarrassing to fail

at this task”, “I feel petrified by the demands of this
task”).
(3) Interest means that the content to be learned is
important for a learner (e.g., Krapp, Hidi, & Renninger,
1992). If learners are interested they have positive affects
and positive evaluations regarding the topic (example
items: “After having read the instruction the task seems to
be very interesting to me”, “For tasks like this I don’t
need a reward, they are lots of fun anyhow.”).
(4) Challenge assesses whether learners accept the
situation as an achievement situation in which they want
to succeed (example items: “This task is a real challenge
for me”, “If I can do this task, I will feel proud of
myself”).
Flow. As a motivational construct during learning, we chose
flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Flow is a pleasant state, in
which the following characteristics occur: (1) a challengeskill balance, (2) merging of action and awareness, (3)
unambiguous feedback, (4) concentration on the task at
hand, (5) time transformation, and (6) fluency of action.
To measure flow, participants filled in the FKS (Flow
Short Scale, by Rheinberg, et al., 2003) after every unit a
student had completed (example items “I am totally
absorbed in what I am doing”, “I know what I have to do
each step of the way.”). The scale consists of 10 items on a
seven-point scale. Thus, for students who had finished after
Unit 3 we had collected three measures, for students who
had finished after Unit 4 we had four measures, and so on.
To compare students at the moment when they finished we
chose the flow measure after each student’s individual last
unit.
Strategy. To retrieve information on how students worked
with the interactive graphics we used the programs StatWin
and Screen Virtuoso to videotape the students’ learning. For
example, we counted the number of used graphics, and we
measured how long students spent with graphics, that is,
time spent with graphics.
As these two measures are merely quantitative, Püttmann
(2008) developed a category system to assess the quality of
the graphic use. She rated each use of an interactive graphic
in one of the following categories:
A = not used
B = careful, little use
C = experimental, but meaningful, extensive
D = playful, meaningless.
Püttmann (2008) demonstrated that this category system
was reliable (Cohen’s κ = .88). She also found that the more
students used interactive graphics in terms of category C,
the better their overall performance (r = .51). Therefore, to
determine the quality of graphic use we counted how often
students used an interactive graphic extensively and in a
meaningful way (Category C).

Performance. Students had to fill in a knowledge test with
12 tasks. These tasks had to be solved in different formats.
For some tasks students had to calculate, some needed
drawings. As the questions consisted of several parts, the
performance maximum score was 70.

Hypothesis 3. For strategy use we chose three indicators:
number of used graphics, time spent with graphics and
quality of graphic use. We first checked, whether they are
correlated (see Table 2).
Table 1: Descriptive statistics (M, SD) for all variables
separated for gender and instruction (f = female, m = male,
con= control group, st = stereotype group).

Results
Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics for all four groups
in our design. Before testing our hypotheses, we checked
whether the control group and the stereotype group had the
same prior knowledge, because prior knowledge could be a
confounding variable. Prior knowledge was measured after
the stereotype instruction and, surprisingly, there was no
instruction effect, F (1, 36) = .10, p = .75, but a significant
instruction by gender interaction effect, F (1, 36) = 13.16, p
= .001. Whereas females who were told to work against the
stereotype produced more prior knowledge than females in
the control group, t(18) = 3.47, p < 0.01, d = 1.59, the
opposite was true for males. Males in the stereotype group
had fewer correct answers in the prior knowledge test than
males in the control group, t(15) = 1.94, p = 0,72, d = 0.95.
Hypothesis 1. In our first hypothesis we assumed that
females in the stereotype group compared with females in
the control group would have a more positive initial
motivation, especially probability of success should
increase. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for all
four factors of initial motivation. As can be seen, the
stereotype group believed more in their success, t(18) =
2.13, p = 0.74, d = .95, and was more challenged, t(18) =
1.77, p = 0.093, d = .78, although not significantly.
With a second test we checked whether our manipulation
reduced the gender effect on motivation. Therefore, we
tested whether the females in the stereotype group differed
from the males in the control group. Results show that
women in the stereotype group believed even more in their
success than men in the control group did, t(17) = 2.98, p =
0.008, d = 1.39.
According to the stereotype lift assumption, males in the
stereotype group have a more positive probability of success
than males in the control group. The data, however, revealed
a weak but not significant difference, t(15) = 0.68, p = 0.40,
d = .43.
Hypothesis 2. In Hypothesis 2 we assumed that females in
the stereotype group would have more flow experience
(after last unit) than females in the control group. The
means in Table 1 and also the statistical test support the
hypothesis, t(18) = 4.30, p < 0.001, d = 1.91.
Our stereotype instruction helped women to experience
even more flow than the male control group, t(17) = 2.10, p
= 0.051, d = .99.
Although initial motivation, that is probability of success,
was more positive for the male stereotype group compared
with the male control group, flow, was more positive, but
not significantly for the male control group, t(15) = 1.25, p
= 0.23, d = .62. This result contradicts the stereotype lift
assumption.

Table 2 demonstrates that all indicators for strategy use

construct. According to our hypothesis, we expected that

Quality of graphic use (3)
In the context of learning a physics program they should
use the interactive graphics sooner and more often in a
meaningful way. Out of the twelve interactive graphics
females in the stereotype group used about six graphics (see
Table 1), the control group only four, t(18) = 1.16, p = 0.26,
d = .52. Therefore, they spent more time with graphics, t(18)
= 1.93, p = 0.070, d = .88. Females in the stereotype group
used more graphics in an experimental, but meaningful way,
t(18) = 2.06, p = 0.054, d = .94. Despite medium and large
effect sizes these differences are not significant. Thus there
is some evidence that the stereotype instruction supported
females to find and use helpful tools of the program.
The next question was whether the stereotype instruction
also helped females to learn in a similar way than the male
control group. This question has to be answered negatively
(see Table 1): Females in the stereotype group used fewer
graphics, t(17) = 1.65, p = 0.12, d = -.83, they spent less
time with the graphics, t(17) = 1.40, p = 0.18, d = -.67,
however, qualitatively, their use was similar, t(17) = 0.57, p
= 0.58, d = -.27.
The stereotype lift hypothesis assumes that males in the
stereotype group would use the graphics slightly more
effectively than the male control group. As expected, the
three indicators showed only small and incoherent effects.
Males in the stereotype group used more graphics (t(15) =
0.95, p = 0.36, d = .45) with higher quality (t(15) = 0.26, p =
0.80, d = .12), but they spent less time with the graphics
(t(15) = 0.27, p = 0.79, d = -.12) than the control group. All
differences were small and not significant.
Hypothesis 4. Finally, the stereotype threat instruction
should improve females’ performance in the stereotype
group compared to the control group. In line with the
motivation and strategy results, the data support the
hypothesis, t(18) = 3.01, p < .01, d = 1.37. Performance of
females in the stereotype group was as high as that of males
in the control group, t(17) = 0.58, p = 0.57, d = .27.
The stereotype lift hypothesis claiming that males in the
stereotype group performed slightly better than the male
control group, was not confirmed, t(15) = 0.78, p = 0.45, d =
-.38.

Discussion
The aim of our research was to find evidence whether the
observed gender effect when learning with the computer
could be reduced through a stereotype threat instruction.

The manipulation consisted of informing female and male
students that there exists a stereotype that females
performed worse than males in physics. They were also told
that there was no solid evidence for this stereotype, so that if
they felt worried or confused during work with the physics
program this had nothing to do with their ability, but was
probably due to the stereotype. In addition, we challenged
the female participants to actively work against this
stereotype. This small manipulation had large effects,
however, as there was not enough statistical power, the
effects were often not significant.
As a treatment check we tested if initial motivation had
improved, especially probability of success. Females in the
stereotype group should now believe in their ability and thus
they should be confident to understand information about
physics which would be presented in the computer program.
The results supported the hypothesis that females in the
stereotype group were more confident than females in the
control group and believed even more in their success than
the male students in the control group. This is very
encouraging, however, it needs a replication.
The stereotype instruction should not only help females’
initial motivation, it should also increase flow-experience
during work with the physics computer program. We found
the same pattern as for initial motivation: Females in the
stereotype group experienced more flow than the females in
the control group and even more flow than the males in the
control group. Therefore, our manipulation not only reduced
the males’ initial advantage, it even could reverse the effect,
that is, males were less positively motivated.
With regard to the question whether our manipulation
could also affect the way in which females work with the
program, we considered their usage of adequate strategies
when working with the interactive graphics. For the
difference between females in the stereotype vs. control
group we found weaker and not significant effects than for
motivation, but females in the stereotype group still
improved their strategies. However, compared to the males
in the control group they still did not use the interactive
graphics that often.
As females’ motivation and their strategies improved
through stereotype threat instruction, their performance also
increased compared with the females in the control group.
The effect was sufficiently large to bring the performance of
the female participants at a level with the male participants.
Overall, we found that the stereotype threat instruction
had a significant effect on relevant variables contained in
the cognitive-motivational process model. However, as we
had a small sample size the study needs a replication.
