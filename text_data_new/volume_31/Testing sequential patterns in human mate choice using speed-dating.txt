Abstract
Choosing appropriate mates from the sequential stream of
possible partners we encounter over time is a crucial and
challenging adaptive problem. But getting data on mate
search is also challenging. Speed-dating provides an
accelerated microcosm of such data which we can use to test
models of sequential mate search. Here we use such data to
assess search heuristics including fixed threshold models and
mechanisms that adjust aspiration levels for mates in response
to previous experiences of success or failure on the mating
market. We find that initial thresholds related to own
attractiveness combined with experience-based threshold
adjustment can account for most of the offers made during
speed-dating.

Introduction—The Problem of Mate Search
Humans and other animals search for the resources they
need, from food to information to habitats to mates.
Rational search strategies have been investigated for a wide
variety of these search problems. Example strategies include
cost-benefit analysis for making a complex choice, or
comparing items directly to maximize success. However,
when searching for a mate or romantic partner, there are too
many factors and unknowns to compose a finite list of
benefits and disadvantages of each candidate, and the
equivalent to comparison-shopping takes extensive time and
is dependent on the ability to return to previously-seen
options, which may often be impossible (Todd & Miller,
1999). Picking a mate from the sequentially-encountered
stream of possibilities is an important decision that
evolution has likely built adaptive strategies to address.
What strategies might humans in particular use, and how
can we find evidence for them? In this paper, we use data
from a sped-up form of real mate search, speed-dating, to
test a variety of models of mutual sequential mate search.
We begin by describing the problem of mate search in more
detail, before turning to some of the proposed models that

have been tested previously via simulation, and then
showing how data from speed-dating can provide empirical
tests as well.
Various strategies have been proposed for specific types
of search problems similar to the setting of mate selection.
For instance, in the secretary problem (Ferguson 1989), a
firm must find the best applicant for a secretarial job, seeing
each applicant one at a time and not being able to return to a
rejected applicant (who has probably since been hired
elsewhere) or predict the quality of future applicants. This
is similar to mate choice in its time-dependent nature, with
previously-passed options not being available for later
choice. Furthermore, as in mate search, the distribution of
the quality of the applicants is not known a priori. In the
case of the secretary problem, the optimal strategy is to look
at N/e of the available applicants, where N is the number of
alternatives and e ! 2.718 is the base of the natural
logarithm system. This translates to seeing the first 37% of
the applicants (without selecting any of them) to form a
general idea of the search space, remembering the quality
(say, typing speed) of the best applicant seen thus far, and
taking his/her quality rating as the threshold for further
search and acceptance. After 37% of applicants have been
reviewed, selecting the next better applicant who is above
the just-set threshold will result in the highest likelihood of
picking the single best applicant. This strategy is optimal
but takes a great deal of time and energy—requiring search
through three quarters of the applicants on average—and
only returns the best solution about 1/3 of the time.
Moreover, this strategy requires knowing N, the number of
possible candidates that could be encountered, which is also
not something that actual mate seekers are likely to know.
Instead of aiming for the optimal solution, individuals can
use heuristics, which are decision rules that use a small
amount of time, information, and computational processing,
and still yield relatively good choices (Gigerenzer, Todd, &
the ABC Research Group, 1999). Heuristics enable
individuals to behave adaptively—if not necessarily
optimally—in complex situations, such as deciding on a

2365

house or picking a potential partner, without high costs of
time and computation. In mate choice, heuristics are
particularly appropriate because the outcome criteria for a
good mate are usually somewhat lenient and not readily
optimized: Individuals are not looking for the perfect
partner, but rather a partner with whom they can be in a
successful relationship. Todd and Miller (1999) showed that
instead of looking at 37% of the available candidates,
assessing around 10% —or even a small fixed number like a
dozen—before setting an aspiration level for further search
would suffice to make a good choice.
While this
significantly decreases the length of the time needed to set a
suitable threshold, the 10% solution makes an important
simplifying assumption, namely that the potential partner
will accept if an offer is made. In much of human mate
search, however, either side can typically refuse, ending the
potential for a relationship. That is, at the same time
individuals are searching, they are being searched for in
return—mate search is mutual.

Simulation Models of Mutual Mate Search
When individuals making simple decisions are put together
into an environment where others are making similar
decisions, this can create a complex and dynamic system
that is challenging to predict and understand (Todd, 2007).
Computer simulations of mutual sequential mate choice give
us a handle on such complexity, allowing us to test how
different decision strategies would work if individuals in a
population followed particular rules when searching for a
partner. A number of such simulation models of marriage
and dating have been proposed, with one of the earliest and
best known being Kalick and Hamilton’s (1986) Matching
Hypothesis model. This model was used to explore
mechanisms behind the observed fact of high (e.g., r=.5-.6)
correlations of the attractiveness of women and men paired
in romantic couples. Kalick and Hamilton proposed a model
in which agents are more likely to make offers to more
attractive mates, and then, because both sexes are pursuing
each other in the same way, the most attractive individuals
accept each other first. The end result is high intracouple
attractiveness correlations—simply due to the mutual twosided nature of searching for a partner.
Another agent-based model takes a different approach to
mate search, where the driving factor is social pressure. The
“Wedding Ring” model proposed by Billari, Prskawetz,
Aparicio Diaz, & Fent (2007) has agents marrying when
social pressure causes a sufficient relaxation of
expectations, resulting in a higher probability of marriage.
Social pressure is driven by a weighted function that
considers the number of married people already in an
individual agent’s social network, as well as the age of the
agent. With increasing social pressure, the acceptable range
of potential partners is expanded, increasing the chances of
an agent finding a suitable partner. This model shows how
the cultural and social elements of mate choice can exert an
important influence on the desire and decision to marry.

A model capable of capturing the observed demographic
distribution of ages at which people first get married, as well
as divorce rates with age, is the Marriage and Divorce
model, or MADAM (Hills & Todd, 2008). Individual agents
search for mates with similar characteristics to themselves.
As time progresses, individuals who have not yet found a
mate relax their aspirations for similarity. Once an agent is
married, their expectations are fixed. If they subsequently
encounter another individual who is above this fixed
threshold and who also accepts them, they will divorce their
current partner to remarry. This model provides a
framework to account for differences in marriage and
divorce rates between different time periods.
Here we focus on further exploring the models proposed
by Todd and Miller (1999; Todd, 2007) for mutual
sequential search in mate choice. Individual agents in a
simulated population go through an “adolescence” phase in
which they form their aspiration level by interacting with
potential partners, and then they proceed to real mate search
in which they use their aspiration level to decide whom to
make an “offer” to. Whenever two individuals both
simultaneously make offers to each other, they are deemed
“mated” and removed from the searching population.
(Fawcett & Bleay, 2009, have also shown the adaptiveness
of changing aspiration levels with experience, using a
different modeling approach.)
In the simplest search model, called Take the Next Best,
individuals merely remember the highest-quality mate they
have seen during the adolescence period and use that quality
as their aspiration level. Then, in the true mate search
phase, they choose the first individual who has a higher
mate value than their aspiration level. This strategy,
however, neglects mutual search, and consequently makes
unrealistic predictions: If all individuals of a population
employ this method, they will all develop high expectations;
but then, since both individuals must accept each other for a
pairing to occur, only those with a high mate value will
successfully pair up.
More realistically, individuals could use the adolescence
period to get an idea of their own mate value and then use
their own relative position on the mating market as their
aspiration level to guide whom they make offers to. Using
one’s own mate value as an aspiration level proves much
more successful: Most individuals pair up, and the
intracouple correlation of mate value is high, making for
stable pairing. Still, this model does not explain how one
comes to know his/her own mate value. Individuals cannot
determine it by self-observation, nor does one know what
criteria the other sex might use when estimating mate value.
One explanation is that individuals use the adolescence
period to constantly update their self-perceived estimation
of their mate value (or aspiration level) by responding to
feedback received from members of the opposite sex. In this
case, during adolescence individuals make and receive trial
offers that cannot end up in actual partnerships, but instead
serve to explore the search space (see Furman, 2002). With
positive feedback (receiving an offer), one would increase

2366

one’s self-appraisal and hence aspiration level, while with
negative feedback (no offer), one would lower both. Todd
and Miller (1999) showed that this adjust up/down model
which alters one’s self-perception based on feedback from
everyone encountered results in pairings of only about 40%
of the population, mostly those individuals with lower mate
values. Their explanation is that this method results in
individuals with mate values above the mean ending up with
aspiration levels that are too high and individuals below the
mean often ending up with aspiration levels that are too low.
Finally, with the adjust relative model, instead of simply
adjusting aspiration levels in response to each oppositesexed individual, individuals consider the mate value of the
person they are interacting with. If that person’s mate value
is above the current aspiration level and they still make a
proposal, the individual receiving the offer should raise
his/her aspiration level in response. If the other person is
below one’s current aspiration level, a proposal is to be
expected and thus one’s aspiration level need not be
adjusted. However, if the other person makes no offer, one
should respond by lowering his/her aspiration level. This
model leads to the most realistic patterns of mate choices,
and hence is what we would most expect to see empirically.

Using Speed-dating for Mate Search Data
To test models of human mate search, we need to have data
about how people search through a succession of potential
partners. Ordinarily, this would take years to gather,
observing a set of people proceeding through the ups and
downs of dating, relationships, marriage, and divorce. But
recently, sped-up versions of this sequential search have
been developed, which allow us to view the process in an
evening instead of in a decade. Speed-dating, one such
modern mate-search institution, is designed to allow singles
to meet a large number of potential romantic partners by
successively participating in “minidates” that typically last 3
to 8 minutes. After each interaction, participants indicate
whether they would like to see the other person again
(making an “offer”). If both individuals are mutually
interested, after the session their contact information is
exchanged so they can arrange future meetings. Speeddating is an ideal way to study mate choice decisions by
maintaining ecological validity in a controlled environment
(Finkel, Eastwick, & Matthews, 2007).
The minidates, while short, still allow for serious mate
choice. Research in the minimal information paradigm has
shown that people can accurately judge others in a very
brief period of time. This accuracy is not just for observable
traits but for personality traits and intelligence as well
(Ambady, Bernieri & Richeson 2000; Borkenau, Mauer,
Riemann, Spinath & Angleitner 2004). Although speeddating events only focus on the initial interactions of
individuals pursuing a romantic partner, this initial stage is
important because outcomes within the speed-dating session
determine which pairings have any chance of becoming
short- or long-term romantic relationships. For these and
other reasons, speed-dating has been used in a growing

number of studies to test features sought in mates (e.g.,
Kurzban & Weeden, 2005; Todd, Penke, Lenton, & Fasolo,
2007; Eastwick & Finkel, 2008) and abilities of observers to
judge romantic interest between speed-dating couples
(Place, Todd, Penke, & Asendorpf, 2009), among other
aspects of human mate choice.
The data used in our computer simulations come from the
Berlin Speed Dating Study (BSDS), a set of carefully
controlled experimental speed-dating sessions run at
Humboldt University in Berlin ((Penke, Back, Klapilova, &
Asendorpf, in preparation; Place et al., 2009). In a typical
BSDS speed-dating session, roughly a dozen men and a
dozen women met in pairs and talked briefly for 3 minutes.
All BSDS participants were actual singles from the general
population who were recruited using advertising and
publicity in media outlets; in exchange for free speeddating, they agreed to have their interactions videotaped and
to provide additional data on themselves. Seventeen
sessions of speed-dating were run as part of the study, for a
total of 382 participants; for all the models described below,
we only used data from the seven sessions of people in their
20’s (78 men and 80 women).
The minidates took place in separate booths, and lasted
for 3 minutes, at the end of which each individual could
record their offer (or not) as well as whether or not they
thought the other person was interested in them. Results
from a follow-up study one year after the BSDS sessions
indicate that several sexual and romantic relationships
developed from matches in the sessions, showing that real
mate choices were made (Penke, et al., in preparation).
Third-party attractiveness ratings of the individuals in
their 20’s in the BSDS dataset were also collected. Six raters
(3 men, 3 women, ages 19 to 22, Cronbach’s !=.54 for male
raters of female photos and !=.52 for female raters of male
photos) judged photos of opposite-sex individuals using a 19 Likert scale, where 1 was “very unattractive” and 9 was
“very attractive.” The mean judged attractiveness of the
women was 3.98 (range of rater averages 1.00-6.67) and of
men was 2.83 (range 1.67-5.33). The mean offer rate of men
was 41% (n=78), and 31% among women (n=80). Mutual
interest between individuals occurred 11% of the time.

Modeling Speed-dater Searches
To find what proposed mate search models might account
for the patterns of sequential offers observed in our speeddating sessions, we begin by looking at the average offer
rates across the speed-dating sessions. Different possible
models predict different patterns at this global level in terms
of offer rates going up, down, or staying constant. One
possibility is that people come to the event with a pre-fixed
preference level based on past experiences in the dating
world at large. These individuals would make offers to
people only above that already established level, so that
their offer rates would be constant throughout the session,
assuming they meet people of different quality levels in
random order. The experience-based aspiration-setting rules
described above predict instead that individuals first explore

2367

the range of possibilities before starting to make actual
offers, which would mean an increase in offer rate that
occurs near the beginning of the speed-dating session.
Individuals may also relax their expectations and lower their
threshold over time, particularly as the end of the session
nears so as to not go home alone, resulting in a late increase
in offer rate. Finally, individuals may fatigue as the evening
progresses, in which case we would expect to see a decrease
in offers toward the end of a session. Do rates of offers by
men or women change over a session in any of these ways?

Figure 1: Mean offer rates made by women (black dashed
line) and men (grey solid line) during each minidate in a
session, averaged across sessions; standard deviations
shown by vertical bars. Women and men saw between 9
and 14 members of the opposite sex.
Figure 1 shows the patterns of offer rates by men and
women for each successive minidate, averaged across all
seven sessions. The fact that the offer rates of both men and
women are roughly flat across the entire speed-dating
session could indicate that participants are determining their
offers using a threshold which does not change with
experience, corresponding to a fixed threshold or fixed
aspiration model (Todd, 2006). But it could also mask
individual differences in the use of changing thresholds.
Hence the next step is to test a variety of mechanisms at the
level of the individual, to see which search strategies fit
participant decisions best. Table 1 shows the model fits.

Fixed aspirations
Operating under the assumption that individuals attending a
speed-dating session have had some experience in the
mating market already, it seems likely that they would have
a previously-set aspiration level that they could use to
decide to whom to make offers. But would they use this
fixed aspiration level throughout the session, rather than
change it as a result of experience within the session? In our
first model simulation, we test how well a fixed aspiration
level between 0 and 7 works to predict the offers that each
individual made as they saw a succession of speed-daters
with different mate values (here taken to be his/her thirdparty attractiveness rating, which is assumed to be highly

correlated with operational mate value in this setting—see
Eastwick & Finkel, 2008; Kurzban & Weeden, 2005; Todd
et al., 2007). The model made an offer whenever the mate
value encountered was above its fixed threshold.
To calculate the fit of this and subsequent models, we
took into account the base rates of offers being made and
weighted the correct predictions of offers and of rejections
independently so that their total contribution to the fit score
would be the same. That is, because women made offers
only 30% of the time (offer rate = 0.3), correct offer
predictions were each weighted 0.7 (=1.0-0.3) while correct
rejection predictions were correspondingly weighted 0.3
(and likewise for assessing models of men’s offers, using
their 43% offer rate). If the model made an inaccurate
prediction, no points were given. These weighted values
were averaged over all dates for each woman (and
separately for each man) and then divided by the maximum
fit possible (if all of that women’s offers had been correctly
predicted). This resulted in a final model fit between 0 and
1, with a random model that makes offers at the group base
rate yielding a fit of .5.
For females the mean best-fitting fixed aspiration level
was 3.52 (sd=2.02) (when taking the highest value for the
aspiration level that fits best for each woman—if the lowest
value is taken, m=2.67, sd=1.58), with a fit of .81. For men,
the mean best-fitting threshold was 3.7 (sd=2.12; or m=2.52,
sd=1.32 for the lowest value), with fit .80. This model thus
predicts offers well, but it does not address how individuals
establish their pre-fixed aspiration level in the first place.
We test two answers to this question by seeing how well
using the BSDS individual’s attractiveness as his or her
fixed aspiration level will do in predicting the offers made.
It seems reasonable that individuals would establish a
threshold similar to their own attractiveness value, as
suggested by the high intracouple correlations of
attractiveness observed in many studies (Kalick &
Hamilton, 1986). First, we used each individual’s self-rated
attractiveness as their threshold for making offers. This
model provided a fit of .59 for women and .60 for men.
However, the correlation between self-rated attractiveness
and the best-fit threshold for each individual was quite high,
r=.81 for women and r=.69 for men. This is surprising for
men, given that previous research found no relationship
between their self-rated attractiveness and where they aimed
their offers to women in a speed-dating session (Todd et al.,
2007); for women, this indication that they take their own
position in the mating market into account when making
their offers, fits our expectations. Also, social relations
analyses of the BSDS data showed that attractiveness
similarity was only a factor affecting choices in women, not
in men (Penke et al., in preparation). Second, using the
third-party ratings of attractiveness as the threshold, the
results were not markedly different; the model fits were .59
and .58 for women and men respectively, and correlations
between third-party attractiveness ratings and best-fist
threshold were r=.62 and r=.81.

2368

Take the Next Best
Our second type of model used an “adolescent” training
phase similar to that employed by Todd & Miller (1999) in
their Take the Next Best model, to see if there was any
learning or adjustment to the small-scale decisions made by
participants as they became familiar with the speed-dating
environment. In the first variation of this model, agents
representing the participants began with an offer threshold
equal to the mean attractiveness levels of all the oppositesex individuals in their speed-dating session. During the
adolescence phase, agents made offers to every opposite-sex
individual they encountered whose attractiveness was above
their initial threshold. After making an offer to an agent,
they would then use that agent’s mate value as their new
threshold, thus implementing experience-based threshold
adjustment or learning. When this phase ended, the
threshold was fixed and offers were made only to
subsequently encountered individuals above this threshold.
Since individuals in speed-dating are able to make offers to
multiple others, this search process is slightly different from
that originally modeled by Todd & Miller (1999), in that
here the offers made during the adolescence phase are real,
and multiple offers can be made after that phase when the
threshold has been fixed. The best-fitting adolescence phase
length for females was around 3 dates (n=46, m=2.76),
yielding an offer fit of .68 (sd=.14)—see Table 1. For some
of the females (n=34) the best fit was achieved by never
entering the adolescence period, simplifying this model into
the fixed threshold model and, resulting in offers only to
those males who were more attractive than the mean. The
same held for many males (n=34), and for those that did
leave the adolescence period the best fit came from leaving
after 2 to 3 dates (n=44, m=2.5), fit .66 (sd=.13).
Take the Next Best was also tested with an initial
threshold set at each individual’s self-rated attractiveness
value. The resulting model for female agents had a fit of .61,
averaging around 3 dates for those individuals who were
best fit with the utilization of an adolescence period (n=17,
m=2.88). For men the fit was .64 averaging 2-3 dates (n=19,
m=2.47). When the third-party attractiveness ratings were
used as the initial threshold, female agents stayed in the
adolescence phase for about 3 dates (n=37, m=3.18),
resulting in a model fit of .67; there was no effect on model
fit (.64) or length of adolescence for men (n=31, m=3.09).

Adjust up/down
In another simulation, corresponding to Todd and Miller’s
(1999) adjust up/down model, agents would increase or
decrease their threshold in response to the perceived interest
of the other agent. If a speed-dater believed that the person
they were meeting would make them an offer, the
corresponding agent increased its threshold by a fixed
increment size between 0 and 1 (tested in 0.1 steps). If not,
the threshold was decremented. In this simulation, agents
were initiated with a threshold set at the mean attractiveness
of the opposite-sex individuals. We found that an increment
size of 0.0 worked for a significant portion of the population

(37 females, 43 males), meaning that they did not change
their aspiration level with experience. For the other
individuals, the average best-fitting increment value for
females was .41, with a fit to the collected data of .68; for
men, the best-fitting increment was .26 yielding a fit of .65.
(Given that the mean attractiveness values of the oppositesex agents could themselves differ by as little as .3, these
threshold increments could still result in significant changes
in rates of offers made over a given session.)
When the initial threshold value was self-rated
attractiveness, 40 females and 40 males were best fit with an
unchanging threshold, while the other females were best fit
with mean increment size of .57, and the other males with
mean increment size of .33 (see Table 1 for fits). The use of
third-party attractiveness as the initial threshold resulted in
45 females and 40 males being best fit by an unchanging
threshold; the other females were best fit with an increment
size of .46 and males with an increment of .43.

Adjust relative
A variation of Todd and Miller’s adjust relative model
(1999) was run in which agents only adjusted their threshold
up when receiving positive feedback from someone above
threshold and adjusting their threshold down when receiving
negative feedback from someone below threshold. This
model worked best with an initial threshold set at the
individual’s own self-rated attractiveness (see Table 1),
though it was not much better than the previous model.

empirical BSDS data, given different initial thresholds.

Implications and further directions
The results from our model simulations suggest that
individuals come into speed-dating sessions with an already
set aspiration level. The high correlation between self-rated
attractiveness and best-fitting fixed threshold indicates that
self-rated attractiveness plays a large role in setting
aspiration levels. Evidence has shown that women consider
their self-rated attractiveness much more than men when
making offers to men (Todd, et al., 2007). We also see this

2369

pattern in our simulations, with the models with initial
thresholds set to self-rated attractiveness fitting women’s
offers. And, surprisingly, self-rated attractiveness also
provides the best model fit for men.
But our results also indicate that people are responsive to
the feedback they get during the speed-dating session—that
is, they adjust their aspiration levels in response to
experience. This is suggested by the superior fit of the
aspiration-adjusting models compared to the other models
(though the former have one more free parameter), with all
models starting with self-rated attractiveness as the initial
threshold. We do not have enough evidence to say
conclusively which of these learning models best accounts
for participants’ data, however, as the fits are too similar.
There could also be limits on how well participants can
apply threshold-adjusting heuristics in a speed-dating
situation. The short interaction time paired with multiple
interactions in quick succession may diminish or distort the
role of feedback on setting aspiration levels. Furthermore,
feedback may be difficult to ascertain correctly, since
nobody has to indicate their rejections (or acceptances)
openly. But even if speed-dating does not reveal strong
evidence for threshold adjusting mechanisms, individuals
may still use some forms of them in regular mate searches
that are based not on initial interest but longer lasting, more
involved interactions. In that case, the overall experience of
speed-dating might cause a change in aspiration level that
could be seen only by following individuals through
multiple speed-dating sessions or in their outside dates.
To understand more fully the complexity of the mate
choice problem, we will continue to expand the range of
heuristic models under consideration, and the sets of data
we can bring to bear to test among the models. We will
begin by analyzing the search behavior of speed-daters in
their 30’s and 40’s and comparing that with the results for
younger people covered here. By looking at different age
groups, we hope to gain further insight into the way in
which aspiration levels for mates are initiated and changed
throughout an individual’s lifetime.
