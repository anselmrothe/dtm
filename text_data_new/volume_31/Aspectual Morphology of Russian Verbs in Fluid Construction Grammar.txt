Abstract
Aspect is undoubtedly the most capricious grammatical category of the Russian language. It has often been asserted as
a mystery accessible only to native speakers, leaving all the
others lost in its apparently infinite clutter. Recent work in
cognitive linguistics has tried to bring order to the seeming
chaos of the Russian aspectual system. But these approaches
have not been operationalized so far. This paper demonstrates
how the aspectual derivation of Russian verbs can be handled
successfully with Fluid Constructional Grammar, a computational formalism recently developed for the representation and
processing of constructions. Keywords: Fluid Construction
Grammar; Russian aspect.

Introduction
Russian aspect is notorious for its complexity. Traditional
analysis organizes Russian verbs according to a paired imperfective vs. perfective distinction, but this only offers partial
explanations and requires a large list of “exceptions” to account for the characteristics of the verb system. These problems have cast doubt on whether there is a system underlying
the conceptualization of Russian aspect. And consequently,
Russian and other Slavic languages are typologically often
classified as an idiosyncratic group in terms of their aspectual
behavior.
However, a promising approach to this issue has emerged
within cognitive linguistics, particularly in the work of Laura
Janda (2004). She motivates Russian aspect with metaphors
grounded in embodied experience and has argued that Russian has in fact a “highly constrained and well-motivated”
structure of aspectual verb clusters that goes well beyond the
distinction between perfective and imperfective (Janda, 2007,
p. 608). She therefore proposes a novel way of classifying
Russian verbs using a more intricate interaction between semantic distinctions than assumed so far.
However, no operationalization exists yet of this hypothesis, indeed most proposals from cognitive linguistics remain
stuck in verbal description without formalisation. Nevertheless, we believe that operationalization is a crucial step in
the empirical research process because it is the only way to
demonstrate the validity, completeness, and coherence of a
proposed linguistic system. The main contribution of this paper is to offer an operationalization of Russian aspect based
on the analysis developed by Janda (2004, 2008) and to
show that Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG), a computational grammar formalism recently developed to allow the bidirectional processing of grammatical constructions (Steels,

2004; Steels and De Beule, 2006), is adequate to capture this
analysis. As part of this effort, we found that an additional
dimension had to be added to Janda’s analysis based on the
well known notion of Aktionsart.
The next section briefly describes the proposal of Janda
and the extension with Aktionsart. Then we briefly report on
the formalisation and implementation effort. Since the linguistic structures of the provided examples are quite elaborate, we can only sketch here the outline of the solution
and give some examples. The interested reader is invited
to look at the complete demonstration of the examples at
www.fcg-net.org/aspect/. In the conclusion, we discuss
the next steps to be undertaken.

Linguistic Background
Russian verbs can be roughly divided into ‘simple’ verbs,
consisting of a stem, suffix and ending, e.g. qit-a-t~i
(‘read’), wip-a-t~i (‘pinch’), and ‘complex’ verbs, which
are derived from the latter by the addition of aspectual markers, e.g. by prefixation pere-qitat~ p (‘re-read’), vywipat~ p (‘pinch out’). Simple verbs typically describe activities and are imperfective (indicated by an index i ), e.g.
rezat~i (‘cut’). In this paper, we focus on how the addition
of a prefix changes the aspect of simple verbs into Perfective
(indicated by an index p ), e.g. na-rezat~ p (‘cut’), pererezat~ p (‘cut off’), po-rezat~ p (‘cut for a while’) etc. Russian has nineteen verbal prefixes that productively form Perfective (Krongauz, 1998). There is also a perfectivising suffix
-nu- leading to such forms as reza-nu-t~ p (‘cut once’).
This study draws upon a theory developed by Janda (2004,
2008), postulating that the lexical meaning of verbs dictates
their aspectual behaviors because different types of events
and their relationship to time are conceptualized in different
ways. This necessitates a distinction among (at least) four
different types of Perfective: Natural, Specialized, Complex
and Single Act Perfectives (Figure 1) – each with different
semantic and morphological behavior. For instance, the verb
wipat~i (‘pinch’) describes an activity that can be completed, which is why it can derive a Natural Perfective obwipat~ p (‘pinch’) (upper right corner in Figure 1). Other
verbs lacking this component in their meaning cannot form
Natural Perfective, e.g. pahnut~i (‘smell’).
If after a modification by a prefix the verb describes an activity with a potential completion, Specialized Perfectives can
be formed, e.g. vy-wipat~ p (‘pinch out’), ot-wipat~ p

Operationalizing Aspect in FCG
We operationalized Russian aspect in Fluid Construction
Grammar (FCG) (Steels, 2004; Steels and De Beule, 2006).
FCG is currently the only computational implementation of
construction grammar which can handle both production and
parsing. FCG is a unification-based grammar formalism that
uses feature structures for representing linguistic knowledge.
A feature structure contains a set of units, a set of features
or slots for each unit, and values for these features. The
units might correspond to lexical items, morphemes, words,
or phrases. Features are both related to syntactic aspects, for
example the form constraints associated with a unit or its syntactic categories, and to semantic aspects, for example, the
associated meaning, the referent identified by the unit, the semantic categories, etc.

(‘separate pinching’), pere-wipat~ p (‘pinch to exhaustion’) etc. Next, if the verb describes an activity that one can
engage in without making progress toward a goal, it is possible to get Complex Act Perfective, e.g by setting a temporal
limit to the corresponding activity - po-wipat~ p (‘pinch a
while’). The last Perfective type - Single Act Perfective - can
be formed if it is possible to extract a single cycle from a
repeated activity, e.g. wip-nu-t~ p (‘pinch once’).
Our efforts to operationalize these aspectual behaviors
showed that Janda’s analysis needs to be expanded with
an explicit implementation of Aktionsart (Forsyth, 1970) in
order to separate between the different temporal semantics
within a single Perfective type. For instance, the Complex
Act Perfective combines an activity with temporal limits, so
it can highlight either the beginning of an activity leading to
an ingressive Aktionsart, e.g. za-rabotat~ p (‘start working’), its ending phase – terminative Aktionsart, e.g. otrabotat~ p (‘stop working’), or just a notion of a limited
time span – delimitative Aktionsart, e.g. po-rabotat~ p
(‘work for a while’). Aktionsarten bridge the gap with prefixes, which encode exactly what feature of an activity is emphasized. It is, however, not always the case that there is one
single prefix for each Aktionsart.

In line with cognitive linguistics, FCG represents all linguistic knowledge in a uniform way, namely as constructions that
map some aspects of meaning into some aspects of form and
back (Goldberg, 1995; Croft, 2005). The proposed constructions can nevertheless be organized into four sets according
to their functionality: There are lexical constructions which
map lexical stems to their meanings, semantic constructions
which recategorise meaning in terms of semantic categories
(within certain syntactic contexts), mapping constructions
which map abstract semantic structures to abstract syntactic
structures, and syntactic constructions which work out and
refine syntactic categories (within certain semantic contexts).
The latter include morphological constructions. The following subsections provide examples of these various constructions using the verb wipat~i (‘pinch’) as example (see Figure 1). It falls out of the scope of the present paper to explain
all technical details of FCG and the reader is therefore not
expected to understand the FCG examples given here in full
detail. Nevertheless these examples are useful as illustrations
and as proof that the whole system has successfully been implemented.
Lexical Constructions Lexical constructions couple for a
particular word its meaning with a string acting as the lexical
stem. In production, the construction triggers when a particular meaning is detected as target meaning and then creates a
new unit (using the J-operator; De Beule and Steels, 2005),
which has particular semantic categories, for example a basetype and a potential for perfectivisation, a particular string as
lexical stem, and additional syntactic categories like the part
of speech. In parsing, the same rule triggers when a certain
lexical stem is detected in the utterance and then creates a
new unit for this word with the same syntactic and semantic
information and the relevant meaning.
The lexical entry for wipat~ (‘ščipat’’, ‘pinch’) (technically for its stem wip- because the rest depends on conjugation) is as follows:

1371

viewed as solid-object into a perfective semantic aspect. The
Aktionsart remains undetermined so far because the solidobject-view is compatible with many event-types, and is
therefore filled in with a logic variable (?event-type).

(define-lex-entry pinch
((?top-unit
(tag ?meaning
(meaning (== (pinch ?event)))))
((J ?new-unit ?top-unit)
?meaning
(referent ?event)
(sem-cat
(==1 (base-type ?event event)
(potential ?event
(completable-culminating
completable-specializing
non-completable
singularizable))))))
<-->
((?top-unit
(tag ?form
(form (== (string ?new-unit "scip")))))
((J ?new-unit ?top-unit)
?form
(syn-cat (==1 (pos verb))))))

The semantic pole of this rule contains features for meaning, referent and sem-cat (stands for semantic category), and
the syntactic pole has form and syn-cat (syntactic category)
features. The lexical entry states that the meaning of wipat~
is ‘pinch’, the referent is the event itself, sem-cat declares it
as an event with a certain potential. The potential plays an important role because it implements the constraints encoded in
the lexical semantics of the verb, i.e., which aspectual forms it
can derive. We saw in the derivational diagram (Figure 1) that
wipat~ can form all four Perfective types. So, it includes
the potential to become completable-culminating by forming
Natural Perfective, completable-specializing for Specialized
Perfective, non-completable for Complex Act Perfective and
singularizable for Single Act Perfective. The syntactic side
defines a string “scip” as a form of the stem and its syn-cat
states that it is a verb as a part of speech (pos).
Semantic Constructions Semantic constructions translate
parts of the meaning which are not directly expressed by lexical items into semantic categories that then will be mapped
onto syntactic features of the utterance, such as morphological markers and word order. We argue that Russian aspect
involves two semantic categories. The first one, according
to Janda (2004), is based on the metaphor that “Perfective
is a discrete solid object” and “Imperfective is a fluid substance.” Without this opposition it is not possible to distinguish between, e.g., the two forms wipat~i (‘pinch’) and
obwipat~ p (‘pinch’) or between perewipat~ p (‘pinch to
exhaustion’) and perewipyvat~i (‘pinch to exhaustion’),
which differ only in how the event is “viewed” as a fluid
substance or a solid object. The second shade of meaning
encodes the semantic category of Aktionsart, which, simply stated, refers to the phase in which the action finds itself. For instance, the perfective derivatives of it~i (‘live’),
such as zait~ p (‘begin to live’), poit~ p (‘live some
time’), otit~ p (‘stop living’), proit~ p (‘live for a certain amount of time’), all belong to the Complex Act Perfective type, but differ in Aktionsart, which is ingressive, delimitative, terminative, and totalizing, respectively.
Here is an example of a semantic rule that maps an event

(define-sem-rule solid-object-sem
((?top-unit
(tag-only ?meaning
(meaning
(== (event-view ?event solid-object)
(event-type ?event ?event-type))))
(sem-subunits (== ?event-unit)))
(?event-unit
(referent ?event)
(sem-cat (==1 (base-type ?event event))))
((J ?event-unit ?top-unit)
?meaning
(sem-cat
(==1
(sem-aspect ?event perfective)
(sem-actionsart ?event ?event-type)))))
<-->
((?top-unit
(syn-subunits (== ?event-unit)))
(?event-unit
(syn-cat (==1 (pos verb))))))

An analogous semantic construction has to be created associating a “fluid substance” view with the semantic category of
imperfective.
Mapping Constructions The mapping constructions map
abstract semantic categories onto abstract syntactic categories.
Roughly speaking, semantic aspect (Perfective/Imperfective) and semantic Aktionsart are translated into
their corresponding syntactic counterparts depending on the
semantic and syntactic context, particularly the potential of
the verb. For instance, the delimitative Aktionsart can be
expressed only within the Complex Act Perfective, so that
the relevant mapping construction has to verify that the corresponding semantic aspect is Perfective, the syntactic aspect is Complex Act Perfective, and the verb is actually able
to derive this form, meaning that its potential includes noncompletable. Here is an example of a mapping rule that implements this constraint:
(define-con-rule delimitative-con
((?event-unit
(referent ?event)
(sem-cat
(==1 (potential ?event (== non-completable))
(sem-actionsart ?event delimitative)
(sem-aspect ?event perfective)))))
<-->
((?event-unit
(syn-cat (==1 (pos verb))))
((J ?event-unit nil)
(syn-cat
(==1
(syn-aspect complex-act-perfective)
(syn-actionsart delimitative))))))

Analogous rules for other Aktionsarten are needed, e.g.
ingressive Aktionsart requires a Complex Act Perfective,
semelfactive Aktionsart requires the Single Act Perfective,
and includes both non-completable and singularizable potentials because only non-completable events are singularisable,
etc. for the other Aktionsarten.

1372

Syntactic Constructions Syntactic constructions complete
the meaning/form relation by specifying the surface forms
(here in particular morphological markers) of abstract syntactic categories (like Perfective or delimitative Aktionsart).
Here is an example of the rule for the prefix po- (‘po-’):

the current coupled feature structure is added to its syntactic
pole. The resulting linguistic structure is shown in Figure 3.

The rule states that the prefix ‘po-’ can be used by the delimitative Aktionsart within the Complex Act Perfective type,
such as in poprygat~ p (‘jump for a while’), pogult~ p
(‘walk for a while’), poderat~ p (‘hold for a while’) etc.
Other prefixes and a perfectivizing suffix -nu- have similar
morphological rules, bringing together syntactic aspect, Aktionsart, and the form of the marker. Additionally, the morph
rule attaches other infixes such as suffix -a- and infinitive
ending t~ (we are neglecting conjugation) and establishes the
ordering prefix-stem-suffix-ending of the verb pattern.

Producing
Let us go through an application of these rules to see how everything works. We will focus on the utterance powipat~ p
(‘pinch a while’) whose meaning is ‘pinch-event viewed as
a solid object and having a limited time span’. Figure 2
presents the initial feature structure in production: on the semantic side the top unit consists of the meaning, the syntactic
pole is empty so far.
The first phase in production is the unification of the semantic pole of the construction with that of the linguistic
structure that the speaker has to build. Lexical constructions
are applied first, so we are searching whether parts of the
meaning to be expressed can be captured by lexical items.
This is the case for the verb ‘pinch’, which has as meaning:
(pinch ?event). Because in production the unification operates on the semantic side, the top unit of the lexical rule for
‘pinch’ unifies with the top unit of the initial feature structure and subsequent application of the J-operator creates the
new unit for the found word, moves a tagged meaning to it
and makes it a child unit of the top unit declaring some of its

Figure 3: The lexical entry of the verb ‘pinch’ has created a
new unit in the semantic and syntactic poles of the linguistic
structure, which encapsulates all the relevant features of the
verb.
The next step in production is the application of the semantic constructions. Here, the “solid-object-sem-rule” incorporates the notion that the event of a kind of event-type
is (metaphorically) viewed as a solid object. Exactly those
meanings were still left in the top unit of the linguistic structure, so the unification of the semantic poles can occur by
binding ?event-type to delimitative and given the coherence
of other semantic features (i.e. there is a subunit of the top describing an event, its sem-cat includes an event as base-type
and the particular event as a referent). After the unification,
the J-operator removes the tagged meaning from the top unit,
inserts it to the meaning of the event unit and adds the corresponding sem-cat of semantic aspect and Aktionsart. The

Figure 4: The semantic construction has removed the grammatically relevant meanings that were left in the top-unit and
added them to the meaning-feature of the new-unit, and added
more information in the sem-cat feature.

Figure 5: The mapping construction was triggered on the semantic categories added by the semantic constructions, and
subsequently added grammatical aspectual features to the
syn-cat of the new-unit.

merging process does not add any information to the syntactic pole because it was already integrated there by the lexical
construction. In the resulting linguistic structure, the semantic side of the top is empty, so all the meaning was absorbed
either by the lexicon or by the semantic categorization (see
Figure 4).
Now it is the turn of the mapping constructions to take
action and enhance the syntactic pole of the feature structure with syntactic categories of the language, which later
become visible though morphology. The aim of the construction “delimitative-con” is to translate the semantic Perfective aspect and delimitative Aktionsart into the syntactic
categories of Complex Act Perfective and delimitative Aktionsart given the proper potential of the verb, in this case to
be non-completable. This rule successfully unifies with our
current feature structure, which has the corresponding semcat and referent in its event unit. Again the J-unit inserts the
needed syntactic categories to the syntactic pole of the current
feature structure in the merging phase (see Figure 5).
The last rule type applied in production is the morphological rules, which express syntactic categories as morphological
markers attached to the word. The rule for the prefix “po-” requires the presence of the syn-cat Complex Act Perfective and
delimitative Aktionsart to unify. The current feature structure
has those, so the rule can apply and create three additional
units for the prefix, suffix and ending through the J-operator,
each with strings and meets-constraints. Figure 6 shows the
resulting feature structure.
The final step in production is to gather all the strings from

the form of all units taking care of the meets-constrains. The
resulting utterance is “po-scip-a-t’” - powipat~ p .

Parsing
One major advantage of using FCG is that it can apply the
same constructions and processing mechanisms for parsing
the utterance “po-scip-a-t’” - powipat~ p - into the meaning ‘pinch-event within the limited time span viewed as a
solid object’ (as opposed to declarative formalisms that need
to compile their constructions into separate generation and
parsing procedures). Parsing is achieved in FCG by simply
reversing the order of construction application: this time, unification will take place in the syntactic pole followed by the
merging of the semantic pole.
The only major difference is that the various types of constructions are applied in a different order: lexical constructions still come first, but are immediately followed by the
morphological rules. This is necessary because these two
rule types provide the syntactic information that is required
to map constructions for determining a verb’s semantic Aktionsart and aspect. Finally, after the mapping construction
has been applied, the semantic constructions can integrate the
grammatical aspect with the inherent Aktionsart of the verb.

Discussion
This paper focused on the notoriously difficult domain of
Russian aspect, examining how the necessary lexical and
grammatical rules could be operationalized using a construction grammar approach. The analysis was primarily based on

the work of Janda (2004, 2007, 2008), who has argued that
the potential for participating in aspect is part of the lexical
definition of the verb. Experiments in operationalizing this
analysis showed however that the notion of Aktionsart had to
be incorporated as well in order to properly handle prefixes.
In this paper, only a small example was shown due to space
limitations, but the whole system has been operationalized
and www.fcg-net.org/aspect/ shows more examples for:
wipat~i - vywipat~ p - vywipyvat~i - povywipyvat~ p (diagram in Figure 1).
From the viewpoint of construction grammar, one of the
most important points of the present paper is that the set of
constructions needs to be subdivided into different subsets
(lexical, semantic, mapping, and syntactic constructions) and
the example of Russian aspect has shown how it is to be done
and that it effectively works in a bi-directional system (parsing and production) without changing the definition of the
constructions themselves. The division into different types of
rules is also helpful to organise the learning process that is
the target of our current research. Lexical constructions can
be learned independently of the complex aspect system, aspect markers can be learned first in an ad hoc way, and then
the more abstract and more difficult to learn categories can be
acquired.
