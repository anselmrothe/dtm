Abstract
The encoding specificity principle, first proposed by Thomson
and Tulving (1970), holds that successful memory
performance depends importantly on the extent to which there
is a match between encoding and retrieval conditions.
However, Nairne (2002) proposed that the principle is a myth
because one cannot make unequivocal predictions about
memory performance by appealing to the encoding-retrieval
match; instead, what matters is the relative diagnostic value of
the match, and not the absolute match. Two experiments
varied the diagnostic value of the cue by manipulating the
degree of cue overload in terms of the extent to which the
retrieval cues subsumed other items in the study list and the
level of the encoding-retrieval match. Results support
Nairne’s (2002) assertion that the diagnostic value of retrieval
cues is a better predictor of memory performance than the
absolute encoding-retrieval match.

retrieval processes; memory.

Introduction
One of the fundamental ideas in modern memory research is
that the match between encoding and retrieval conditions
affects memory performance, an idea that was first proposed
in a series of studies conducted by Tulving and colleagues
(Tulving & Osler, 1968; Thomson & Tulving, 1970;
Tulving & Thomson, 1973; Tulving, 1983). These studies
suggested that successful remembering is a joint function of
encoding and retrieval processes, and subsequently led to
the encoding specificity principle, which states that a
retrieval cue will be effective to the extent that it was
specifically encoded at the time of learning. Thus, if the
target word NAIL is encoded and stored in the context of the
word FINGER, a subsequent retrieval cue such as a tool will
be ineffective, but a cue such as a part of the human body
will probably be quite effective.
Recently, Nairne (2002) argued against the case that
similarity between encoding and retrieval conditions (or the
encoding-retrieval match) is all that matters in cue
effectiveness. He in fact argued that knowing the status of
the encoding-retrieval match by itself predicts next to
nothing about subsequent retention. It is not matching
features from the encoding and retrieval conditions per se
that are needed; it is the presence of features that help
discriminate the correct target from incorrect competitors,

i.e., the distinctiveness of the retrieval cue. Using the NAIL
example, if its competitors included TOE and HAND, the
effectiveness of the cue a part of the human body would
probably be diminished. Adopting Watkins and Watkins’
(1975) terminology, the cue can be said to be “overloaded”
as it does not provide any diagnostic information about the
target occurrence because the competitors are also
subsumed by the cue.
As an analogy, Nairne (2002) likened the relationship
between the encoding-retrieval match and cue
distinctiveness to intensity and brightness. What determines
the perception of brightness of a light is the amount of light
falling in the centre relative to the surroundings, not the
absolute amount of light. In a similar vein, he argued that it
is not the absolute encoding-retrieval match that is critical,
but rather the relative diagnostic value of the match, which
is the extent to which the cue uniquely specifies the target.
It is in this sense that he argued that the encoding specificity
principle is a “myth” because although the principle
specifies that the successful retrieval of a target depends
importantly on the extent that to which there was a match
between encoding and retrieval conditions, it is not the
absolute match per se that predicts memory performance,
but the relative distinctiveness of the retrieval cue.
The question that then arises is whether these arguments
render the encoding specificity principle, which claims that
“a retrieval cue is effective if, and only if, the information
about its relation to the to-be-remembered (TBR) item is
stored at the same time as the TBR item itself” (Thomson &
Tulving, 1970, p. 255), irrelevant or redundant. The aim of
the present study is to examine these arguments in more
detail and to empirically test the predictions articulated in
Nairne’s (2002) thought experiments.

Experiment 1
One thought experiment can be summarised as follows.
Participants memorise a series of events E1, E2, E3 ... En, and
are asked to recall E1. E1 has features X1 and X2 which
could be provided as retrieval cues. From the perspective of
the encoding specificity principle, providing both X1 and X2
as cues should logically increase the degree of the encodingretrieval match compared to a single retrieval cue. Hence,
one would expect better recall for the condition with two
retrieval cues than the condition with just one cue.

2523

However, suppose X2 is also found in E2, E3 … En. X2 now
provides no diagnostic value for differentiating E1 from its
competitors. In this case, the two cue condition would not
have any advantage over a single cue. Performance may
even decline since X2 subsumes all of the memorised
events.
These predictions were tested in Experiment 1 using a
cued recall task. In each trial, participants studied 10
semantically unrelated cue-target pairs such as ABORTDONKEY. The degree of cue overload and the degree of the
encoding-retrieval match were varied. In the high-overload
conditions, all 10 cue-target pairs had targets that were from
the same semantic category as DONKEY, e.g. TIGER,
ELEPHANT. In the low-overload conditions, the targets
were unrelated to DONKEY, e.g. FINGER, PAPAYA. In the
high-match conditions, two retrieval cues were provided at
test, the original studied cue abort, and a second cue that
was the name of the semantic category that DONKEY
belonged to, a four-footed animal. In the low-match
conditions, only the original studied cue was provided.
If the predictions of the thought experiment are correct,
only the low-overload condition would benefit from an
increase in the encoding-retrieval match by the provision of
a second retrieval cue, since that cue uniquely specifies the
target DONKEY and maximises the diagnostic value of the
retrieval environment.

Design and materials A 2 (Overload: high, low) x 2
(Match: high, low) within-subjects design was employed.
Forty semantic categories were selected from the Van
Overshelde, Rawson, and Dunlosky (2004) and Yoon et al.
(2004) norms. The category name was used as the second
retrieval cue in the high-match conditions. From each
category (e.g, a four-footed animal), an exemplar with a low
response frequency (e.g. DONKEY) was selected to be a
critical target, i.e. a target that would be tested in the recall
phase. Response frequency refers to the proportion of
responses that produced that exemplar out of the total
responses for that category. High response exemplars were
not selected as critical-targets in order to minimise guessing
when given the category name as a retrieval cue. From each
category, nine high response exemplars (e.g. TIGER,
ELEPHANT) were selected to be foil-targets, i.e. targets that
would be studied but not tested during recall. When studied
within the same list, these foil-targets would generate high
cue overload as they are subsumed by the category retrieval
cue. Each target was then paired with a semantically
unrelated cue word. Thus, there were altogether 40
category-lists of 10 cue-target pairs (1 critical-pair and 9
foil-pairs) each.
All words were rated for familiarity by participants who
did not take part in the study but were from the same
population as the experimental sample. Unfamiliar words
were replaced and checked again. The lists were then

divided into 4 sets of 10 lists each, which were equated for
average response frequency, word frequency, and number of
syllables.
Procedure A balanced latin-square procedure was used to
rotate the sets across the 4 conditions in the study. For any
one participant, a set was assigned to a single condition and
was never repeated across conditions. In the high-overload
conditions, all cue-target pairs were sampled from within
the same category-list. In the low-overload conditions, each
cue-target pair was sampled from a different category-list
within the set.
A single trial comprised a study phase where ten cuetarget pairs were displayed one at a time, with the cue
appearing to the left of the target, at a rate of two seconds
per pair centred on the computer monitor. To avoid primacy
and recency effects, the critical cue-target pair always
appeared randomly in either the fourth, fifth, sixth or
seventh serial position within the sequence. After the study
phase, the test cue(s) appeared and participants typed in
their response before moving to the next trial. Participants
were told that on some trials, an additional cue would be
provided to assist recall.
The 40 trials, 10 from each condition, were randomly
interspersed throughout the experiment. Eighteen filler
trials that were similar to the experimental trials were also
randomly interspersed. These fillers were created such that
their critical-pairs were presented in either the first three or
last three positions of the sequence, so as to prevent
participants from noticing that the position of the criticalpair to be tested always occurred in the middle of the
sequence. No subsequent analyses were performed on these
fillers.

Results and discussion
The correct recall proportion is summarised in Table 1.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant
interaction, F(1,39) = 13.89, MSe = 0.01, p < .01. Planned
comparisons of the simple effects showed that when cue
overload was low, recall was better in the high-match
condition than the low-match condition, F(1,39) = 17.14,
MSe = 0.02, p < .001. In the high-match conditions, recall
was also better with low-overload than high-overload,
F(1,39) = 8.92, MSe = 0.02, p < .01. No other simple
effects were reliable.

The pattern of results is consistent with the predictions of
Nairne’s (2002) thought experiment. Providing a second
retrieval cue in the form of the category name of the target
should increase the encoding-retrieval match relative to a
single cue. However, this advantage only occurs if the

2524

second cue confers additional diagnostic information. If the
second cue subsumes competing targets, as is the case in the
high-overload conditions, then performance is no better than
having just a single cue. This supports the contention that it
is the relative diagnostic value of the cue that is important in
predicting cue efficacy, rather than the absolute value of the
encoding-retrieval match.

Experiment 2
Experiment 1 demonstrated that high match can be negated
by high overload. Is it possible to demonstrate a situation in
which the encoding-retrieval match still matters despite a
large amount of overload?
Nairne (2002) argued that memory performance can be
conceptualised as a joint function of the degree of the
encoding-retrieval match and the degree of cue overload,
where performance is proportional to the former and
inversely related to the latter. If this is true, then one can
hypothesise that increasing the encoding-retrieval match
should cause performance to increase if the degree of cue
overload does not change across conditions.
If we consider the original paradigms used to investigate
encoding specificity (e.g. Newman et al., 1982; Thomson &
Tulving, 1970), it may be easy to see why they were able to
demonstrate specificity effects. The general procedure
required participants to memorise a set of cue-target pairs
that were pre-experimentally weakly associated, such as
TRAIN-BLACK. Weakly associated pairs were studied so
that recall by guessing is minimised. At test, some
participants were re-presented with the originally studied
weak cue train; others were given an extra-list cue that was
pre-experimentally strongly associated with the target
BLACK, such as white; and a final group was either given
no cue at all or a weakly associated extra-list cue. Results
showed that the original studied cue train, though weakly
associated with the target, was much better in eliciting recall
of BLACK than the other conditions, including strongly
associated cues such as white. This was the primary basis
for the encoding specificity argument – when the target
BLACK was studied in the context of TRAIN, the target
word was encoded in a specific manner that is distinct from
the pre-experimental encoding of BLACK in the context of
WHITE. This demonstrated that for a cue to be effective, it
must be stored during the original encoding.
It is important to note that most experimental work on
encoding specificity did not make any explicit control for
the degree of cue overload. Although each cue-target pair
was associated, there were presumably no associations
across pairs similar to the manipulations that were done for
Experiment 1. It is then entirely possible that the degree of
cue overload was essentially held constant across the
experimental conditions. Hence, re-presenting the original
studied cue would maximally increase the encodingretrieval match and result in the best performance.
Experiment 2 introduced a novel manipulation of cue
overload to a design adapted from Newman et al. (1982).
Participants studied weakly associated cue-target pairs such
as TEA-POT, AIRPLANE-BIRD, and ROOF-TIN. At test,
participants would be re-presented with the originally
studied weak intra-list cue, e.g. tea for recalling POT; a

strong extra-list cue, e.g. feather for recalling BIRD; or a
weak extra-list cue, e.g., armour for recalling TIN. In the
high-overload conditions, the foil cue-target pairs that were
studied with the critical-pair had targets that were strongly
associated with the recall cue in the respective test
conditions. For example, COFFEE, ICE for the intra-list
cue tea; LIGHT, SOFT for the strong extralist cue feather;
and KNIGHT, PROTECTION for the weak extralist cue
armour. In the low-overload conditions, foil-targets were
unrelated to the recall cues.
At first glance, one might expect to obtain results similar
to Experiment 1, in that the high-overload condition should
eliminate any advantage of an encoding-retrieval match that
would be obtained by providing the intra-list cue at test.
However, we make the somewhat counter-intuitive
prediction that while overall recall rates would drop in the
high-overload conditions due to the subsuming of foiltargets under the recall cues, there should still be some
evidence of facilitation due to the use of an originally
studied cue relative to the extra-list cues, i.e. the encoding
specificity effect, even in the high-overload conditions.
This is because when the encoding-retrieval match was
increased (i.e. from no match in the extra-list conditions to a
match in the intra-list condition), the degree of overload did
not change across recall conditions. Overload remained
either high or low because all retrieval cues were
manipulated to either subsume all the targets of the foilpairs or were unrelated to those foil-targets. In this
situation, the use of an intra-list cue should provide enough
diagnostic information relative to extra-list cues to facilitate
recall.

Method
Participants Forty introductory psychology students who
did not take part in the previous experiment participated for
course credit.
Design and materials A 2 (Overload: high, low) x 3 (CueType: intra-list, strong extra-list, weak extra-list) withinsubjects design was employed.
A total of 54 critical cue-target pairs, 9 in each of the 6
experimental conditions, were created based on the Nelson,
McEvoy, and Schreiber (1998) norms. For the intra-list and
weak extra-list conditions, a target word (e.g. POT) that was
weakly associated with each recall cue (e.g. tea) was first
selected. For the strong extra-list conditions, a strongly
associated target was selected. In the three high-overload
conditions, 7 words (e.g. COFFEE, ICE) strongly
associated with each recall cue were then selected to be the
subsumed targets of the foil-pairs. In the three low-overload
conditions, the 7 foil-targets were not associated with the
recall cues. All targets were then paired with a weakly
associated word to form the cue-target pairs (e.g. TEA-POT,
AROMA-COFFEE, GLIDE-ICE). Following Newman et
al.’s (1982) study, a further constraint was that for both
extra-list conditions, each studied cue (e.g. ROOF) of a
critical cue-target pair was semantically unrelated to the
corresponding extra-list recall cue (e.g. armour). This was
to minimise indirect retrieval of the target via associations

2525

between the studied and recall cues. Each of the 6
experimental conditions thus had 9 lists of cue-target pairs,
with each list comprising 1 critical-pair and 7 foil-pairs.
The words were then checked for familiarity using the
same method as Experiment 1. Due to various constraints
faced in selecting the words, it was not possible to divide
them into lists and rotate them through the conditions using
latin-square procedures. Lists were thus fixed across
conditions and were equated on average associative strength
between the recall cue and subsumed targets for the highoverload conditions. This was to ensure that recall
differences cannot be attributed to differences in the amount
of overload generated by the subsumed targets across the 3
cue-type conditions. The low-overload conditions were
already equated as it was ensured that recall cues and foiltargets were not associated.
Procedure Instructions to participants followed those of
Newman et al. (1982). They were asked to memorise all
target words and to pay attention to the cue word that
accompanied each target as it might help them to remember
the target. They were also informed that recall cues at test
were related to the targets but they may or may not be from
the study lists. They were to recall the target that they think
was related to the cue.
Eighteen trials were required to present the 54
experimental-lists without replacement. Within each list of
1 critical-pair and 7 foil-pairs, the presentation order was
fixed such that the critical-pair is presented first followed by
the foil-pairs in descending order of their targets’
associative strength to the corresponding condition’s
eventual recall cue. This was done to maximise the degree
of activation of the recall cue, and thus maximise cue
overload at test.
A single trial comprised a study phase where 6 filler cuetarget pairs were first presented, followed by a random
selection of 3 lists from 3 of the 6 experimental conditions.
The purpose of the fillers was to minimise primacy effects,
since the critical-pair of each list was always the first pair in
the within-list sequence. This resulted in 30 pairs to be
studied on each trial, which closely approximated the
original procedure of Tulving and Thomson (1970), which
had 24 pairs for each study trial. Each pair was presented
one at a time on the monitor at a rate of two seconds per
pair.
At the end of each trial, the 3 recall cues for the presented
conditions were shown one at a time in a random order.
There was also a recall cue from one of the filler trials,
otherwise participants may notice that the first few pairs
were never tested. Participants typed their responses to each
cue before the next one was shown. Responses to the filler
cues were not analysed. After all responses to the 4 cues
were made, the study phase of the next trial of 30 pairs was
initiated.

Results and discussion
The correct recall proportion is summarised in Table 2. An
ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of overload,
F(1,39) = 90.24, MSe = 0.02, p < .001. Recall was better

with low-overload (M = .31, SD = .11) than high-overload
(M = .14, SD = .07). The main effect of cue-type was also
reliable, F(2,78) = 38.33, MSe = 0.03, p < .001. Planned
contrasts showed that the intra-list cues (M = .32, SD = .16)
elicited better recall than both the strong extra-list cues (M =
.25, SD = .11), F(1,39) = 4.83, MSe = 0.02, p < .05, and the
weak extra-list cues (M = .09, SD = .08), F(1,39) = 62.40,
MSe = 0.02, p < .001. Strong extra-list cues were better
than weak extra-list cues, F(1,39) = 66.58, MSe = 0.01, p <
.001. The interaction was not significant, F < 1.

The pattern of results replicated the basic findings of
Newman et al. (1982) and Thomson and Tulving (1970).
The low-overload conditions were essentially similar to
these previous studies, and showed that re-presenting the
original studied cue, even though it was weakly associated
with the target, elicited better recall than extra-list cues,
even those with strong associations with the target. In the
novel high-overload conditions, the same pattern emerged,
even though overall recall dropped significantly. This
demonstrates that if cue overload can be experimentally
held constant across retrieval conditions, then the difference
in the encoding-retrieval match between extra-list and intralist cues would lead to a facilitative recall advantage for the
latter, even when cue overload is high.

General Discussion
The present experiments were designed to evaluate whether
Nairne’s (2002) claims that the encoding specificity
principle is a myth is valid. The principle specifies that
successful memory performance depends importantly on the
similarity, or match, between encoding and retrieval
conditions. However, Nairne (2002) argued that to improve
performance, it is not really the absolute encoding-retrieval
match that is critical, but rather the presence of diagnostic
features that help discriminate the target from competitors.
Stated differently, what matters is not the absolute
encoding-retrieval match, but the relative diagnostic value
of the match, which is the extent to which the retrieval cue
uniquely specifies the target. Nairne (2002) supported his
claims through a few thought experiments, which suggested
that under the right circumstances, increasing the encodingretrieval match can improve performance, produce no effect,
or even lower performance. In this respect, he argued that
the encoding-specificity principle is a myth. Specifically,
the myth is that recall performance will improve to the
extent that features of the retrieval cue match those present
during original encoding.
Experiment 1 demonstrated that an increase in the
encoding-retrieval match does not necessarily result in a

2526

recall advantage. Providing a second retrieval cue that
subsumes the target should theoretically increase the
functional match because there are now two features, the
original studied cue and an additional feature that is present
in the target. However, if this second cue also subsumes the
target’s competitors, the increased match is now countered
by an increase in cue overload. This essentially reduced the
diagnostic value of the two-cue retrieval condition, leading
to recall levels that were no better than the one-cue
conditions. Only when the second cue uniquely specified
the target was there an increase in the relative
distinctiveness of the two-cue retrieval condition over the
single cue condition, leading to better recall.
Experiment 2 demonstrated that the encoding and
retrieval conditions could be manipulated such that
increases in the encoding-retrieval match would result in
improved recall in spite of increases in cue overload. This
occurred only because the degree of overload, regardless of
whether it was high or low, was held constant across the
retrieval conditions. Therefore, the increased match found
in the intra-list cues provided information that overlapped
with the original encoding, which conferred a recall
advantage over the extra-list cues, and the advantage was
still evident in spite of the general reduction of recall
performance due to high cue overload.
At this point, it is possible to argue that having
demonstrated that other factors such as cue distinctiveness
also play important roles in recall need not necessarily
render the encoding-specificity principle a myth. Both
encoding-specificity and cue distinctiveness could play
equally important roles in retrieval.
Nairne (2002)
addressed this point and claimed that it is misleading to give
equal weight to both encoding specificity and cue
distinctiveness because the main controller of performance
is the distinctiveness of the retrieval cue (or diagnostic value
of the encoding-retrieval match), rather than the absolute
encoding-retrieval match. He suggested that when an
encoding-retrieval match leads to an improvement in recall,
it could be because the matching features happened to
possess diagnostic features which may help one to
discriminate the target item from its competitors. This was
precisely what happened in Experiment 2.
In conclusion, it is apparent from the present findings that
increasing the encoding-retrieval match need not necessarily
facilitate recall. It could facilitate recall, when cue overload
was kept constant (Experiment 2), but it could also have no
effect on recall when the match increase was countered by a
cue overload increase (Experiment 1). It can be argued,
therefore, that an encoding-retrieval match is not
intrinsically or universally beneficial, but should be
effective in so far as the matching features do not overlap
with the encoded features of other possible retrieval
candidates. The critical factor for successful retrieval thus
appears to depend on the extent to which a retrieval cue can
provide diagnostic information about the target. For
example, if one was asked to search for a particular

individual and was told that this person is a boy in school
uniform, this information would most likely be very useful
for identifying this person in a room full of adults.
However, the same cue would practically provide no
distinctive information about that particular person in the
setting of a school cafeteria full of school boys (Goh & Tan,
2006).
Is the encoding specificity principle a myth? The present
findings suggest a ‘yes’ because in line with Nairne’s (2002)
proposal, an encoding-retrieval match by itself cannot be
used to make unequivocal predictions about memory
performance. As argued throughout, it is the relative extent
to which a retrieval cue uniquely specifies a given target
(i.e. cue distinctiveness) that determines successful memory
performance.
