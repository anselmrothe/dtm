Abstract
Human performance can degrade as a result of an increasing
cognitive workload. Especially in domains in which good task
performance is crucial these effects are unwanted, and hence,
need to be avoided. In Psychological literature studies have
been presented which relate a variety of measures to the
workload experienced by humans. However, these
experiments have not been conducted with more complex
tasks. In this paper, the aim is to perform a variety of
measures to see whether combinations thereof can be used to
predict performance of humans under tasks with varying
complexity. A dedicated experiment has been conducted with
31 subjects, of which the results have been analyzed from
both a statistical as well as a temporal perspective.
Keywords: human workload, human
personality, physiological measures.

Introduction
Working under high pressure can result in negative effects
on the functional state of a human (see e.g. Hancock 1995,
Hockey 1997). As a result of this negative effect, the
performance of the task at hand can be negatively
influenced. In critical domains such degradation of
performance can lead to severe consequences that might be
highly undesired (Wickens, 2002) Therefore it is very useful
to be able to obtain more precise knowledge about
measurements that can be used to make more accurate
predictions concerning the performance upon tasks (and the
potential degradation thereof).
In the literature, various measurements have been
proposed to measure the cognitive workload experienced by
humans. Roscoe (1992) for example, shows that the heart
rate of a human is a good indicator of cognitive workload (if
no physical effort is performed). Also subjective
measurements have been put forward, such as the NASATLX questionnaire (Hart and Staveland, 1988). In (Rose et
al., 2002) the relation between the so-called Big Five
personality factors upon vigilance performance and
workload has been studied. However, the tasks studied do
not concern complex tasks.
In this paper, the aim is to perform a set of measurements
to see whether the performance of a task can be predicted
for complex tasks as well using (a combination of) these

measurements. Hereby, an experiment has been conducted
whereby participants had to perform a cognitive task with
varied complexity. The measurements performed consisted
of: (1) personality characteristics (using the NEO-PI-R and
NEO-FFI test, cf. Costa and McCrae, 1992); (2) cognitive
abilities (using several tests); (3) performance quality using
an objective measure; (4) the complexity of the task; (5) the
NASA-TLX as a measure of perceived workload, and (6)
the heart rate during the experiment.
For the data obtained, the prediction is that performance
will depend on personality characteristics, as well as on
heart rate and the complexity of the task. Furthermore, the
subjective performance as measured with the NASA-TLX is
predicted to be dependent on objective performance and
personality.
For the data analysis, not only a statistical analysis is
performed, but also more complex temporal properties have
been analyzed. For example trends over time that influence
the performance quality and perceived workload will be
analyzed. In order to enable such a temporal analysis, tools
from the domain of Artificial Intelligence are used (cf.
Bosse et al., 2008).
Using these analysis methods, the relationship between
personal characteristics (like personality, cognitive abilities
and expertise) and performance is investigated for complex
tasks, as well as between task characteristics (e.g. the
complexity of a task) and performance. These kinds of
relations can be used to give adequate support, for example
if a correlation would be found between heart rate and
performance, a high heart rate would indicate that another
human should be signaled to support the performance of the
task.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the
experimental setup is described. Section 3 describes the
statistical non-temporal analysis whereas Section 4 descries
the temporal analysis. Finally, Section 5 is a discussion.

Experimental Setup
Participants
In this study 31 people participated (18 males, 13 females),
of which 25 students from the Vrije Universiteit.

2819

Participants ranged in age from 17 to 57 years with a mean
age of 26 years. The experiment took approximately 1 hour
for which participants received a voucher of 10 euro. In
addition, there was a voucher of 100 euro for the participant
with the best score on the experiment-task.

The Task

of points a participant receives for destroying an enemy is
proportional to the proximity of the explosion and to the
distance travelled by the contact, with a maximum of 10000
points. When a participant shoots an ally or when an enemy
reaches the bottom of the screen 10000 points are lost.
When an allied contact reaches the bottom of the screen the
participant receives 1000 points.

Procedure

Figure 1: A screenshot of the experiment-task.
In the experiment the main task was a shooting game
where the goal was to get as many points as possible. The
task was performed on a 24” monitor displaying a fullscreen application at 1900x1200 pixels. During the
execution of the task the participant was wearing
headphones to allow auditory feedback and to minimize
distraction. A partial screenshot of this task is displayed in
Figure 1. The object at the bottom of the screen represents
the participant’s (stationary) weapon. Contacts (allies and
enemies in the shape of a purple dot with a radius of 5
pixels, each accompanied by a simple mathematical
equation) appear at a random location on the top of the
screen and fall down to a random location at the bottom of
the screen. The speed at which the contacts fall varies
between 50 and 100 pixels per second. The rate at which the
contacts appear varies between 10 and 20 seconds in less
demanding situations and between 2.25 and 4.5 seconds in
demanding situations. The identification of a contact is
performed by checking the correctness of its equation,
incorrect equations correspond to enemies and correct ones
to allies. Points are gained by shooting down the enemies
and by allowing the allies to land. The participant can shoot
a missile by executing a mouse click at a specific location;
at that moment, the missile will move from the weapon and
explode exactly at the location of the mouse click. The
speed with which the missile reaches this location is 80
pixels per second. When a contact is within a radius of 50
pixels of the exploding missile, it is destroyed. The number

For the experiment a 2 factor within subjects design was
used. Two different conditions within each participant were
tested. Condition 1 (easy-difficult) started with 1 object
present per 10 to 20 seconds (easy). After 7.5 minutes the
number of objects which were presented per second (1
object per 2.25 to 4.5 seconds) was increased and more
difficult equations were given (difficult). Condition 2
(difficult-easy) started with the difficult section (as the
difficult section in condition 1), after 7.5 minutes the
number of objects which were presented per second was
decreased (as in the easy section in condition 1). Both
conditions took 15 minutes in total. The condition was
counterbalanced over participants to correct for a possible
order effect, such that participants with an odd number
started with condition 2 and participants with an even
number started with condition 1.
First, participants had to fill out a personality
questionnaire with questions from the NEO-PI-R and the
NEO-FFI (Costa and McCrae, 1992); with these questions
some aspects of each participant’s personality were
measured in order to see if performance and stress are
dependent on personality. Neuroticism and extraversion
were measured with the NEO-FFI. With the NEO-PI-R
vulnerability (aspect of neuroticism) and ambition (aspect of
conscientiousness) were measured. When participants
finished the questionnaire, electrodes were attached to the
participants’ body such that an ECG could be measured, and
the experiment was started.
Before performing the experiment-task, participants had
to perform three small tests. Instructions for each test were
shown on the screen. Participants started with a simple
choice Reaction Time test (choice-RT), where a square was
presented either left or right from a fixation cross at the
centre of the screen. Participants had to react with either the
left arrow (when the square was presented left) or the right
arrow (when the square was presented right). Simple RT is
often used to measure general cognitive ability (Plomin and
Spinath, 2002). The second test was a task where equations
were presented similar to the equations in the identification
task of the experiment. As in the experiment-task,
participants had to choose whether the equation was correct
(left arrow) or incorrect (right arrow). The third small test
(mouse-RT) was another Reaction Time task; here a circular
target was presented somewhere on the screen. Participants
had to react quickly and precisely by clicking with the
mouse as close as possible to the centre.
After the three small tasks, participants practiced during 3
minutes for the experiment-task. The goal of the practice

task was familiarize with the shooting and identification
tasks in the main experiment. After practice the participants
started the experiment-task with either condition 1 or
condition 2. When they finished one condition, the
participants filled out the NASA-TLX (Hart and Staveland,
1988) to measure their perceived workload and performance
quality. After five minutes rest, the second condition was
started.

Data Analysis
All participants were analyzed using a repeated measured
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), using the Huyn-Feldt
correction for violations of the sphericity assumption of the
variance-covariance matrix. Personality was divided in three
groups, low, middle and high, based on a significantly lower
score than average (1-3), an average score (4-6) and a
significantly higher than average score (7-9) and was used
as a between subjects factor. In all tests, the significance
level was .05.

Statistical Results
The performance was calculated similar to the score in the
task. Performance increased when participants shot an
enemy (depending on the proximity of the explosion and on
the travelled distance of the enemy and on how many shots
they used) and when participants landed an ally. When
participants shot an ally or landed an enemy, performance
decreased.
Table 1 shows the results of the ANOVA, on the
dependent variable performance and heart rate and their
interactions with personality characteristics. When looking
at performance, a difference was found between low and
high task demands. When task demands were low,
performance was lower (M=0.91, SD=0.13) than when task
demands were high (M=0.83, SD=0.14). The interaction
between performance and ambition shows that this
difference disappears for participants who scored high on
ambition (Figure 2). This difference in performance is
especially apparent in the condition with low task demands,
where performance of participants with a high level of
ambition is lower (M=0.81, SD=0.16) than that of
participants with a medium (M=0.92, SD=0.12) or a low
(M=0.98, SD=0.08) level of ambition.

Figure 2: Mean performance as a function of task demands
and level of ambition.

Figure 3: Mean heart rate as a function of Task Demands
and Neuroticism.
The difference in heart rate between low and high task
demands was significant, indicating that when task demands
were low, heart rate was low (M=76.46, SD=10.47)
compared to when task demands were high (M=78.23,
SD=10.22). Furthermore, the significant interaction between
heart rate and neuroticism points out that heart rate of
participants who scored high on neuroticism was higher
than heart rate of participants who scored low or medium on
neuroticism. In addition, no difference in heart rate between
low and high task demands was found in participants who
scored high on neuroticism (Figure 3).
To further investigate the relationship between heart
rate/performance and personality characteristics, a
regression analysis was conducted. The interaction of
neuroticism and performance was revealed in the regression
analysis in the sense that neuroticism predicted performance
when task demands were low (R²=0.19, r=-0.34, F(1, 28) =
6.61, p<0.02). The negative correlation indicates that an
increase in ambition predicted a decrease in performance
quality. No significant results were found on other
personality characteristics.
In addition, it has been tested whether the equation test
and mouse-RT test are a good representation of the expertise
level of the participant. For this, the dependence of
performance quality on these two tests has been analyzed.
Also, the dependence of heart rate on expertise profile has
been tested to see whether more experienced participants
show a lower heart rate. No significant dependence was
found between performance quality and both tests. In
addition, no significant dependence was found of heart rate
on the equation and mouse-RT scores.
The dependence of performance quality on heart rate has
been measured to see if a higher heart rate results in lower
performance. No significant relation has been found for all
four parts of the two conditions or for the average
performance on both low and both high parts. For the
NASA-TLX, first regression analysis was conducted to see
whether participant’s score on the subscale “Performance’
was dependent on their actual performance. The analysis
revealed no significant difference, indicating that actual
performance could not explain participant’s score on the
performance subscale of the NASA-TLX.

Furthermore, a repeated measures ANOVA was
conducted to investigate the difference between low task
demands and high task demands regarding the score on the
NASA-TLX. In Table 2, results of the ANOVA are
displayed, non-significant results excluded. The analysis
revealed significant differences on all subscales between
low and high task demands. On all subscales, mean score
was higher when task demands were high than when task
demands were low. Mean scores are represented in Table 3.
In addition, a trend in interaction was found between
participant’s score on Effort and their score on the
personality characteristic neuroticism. This interaction
shows that when participant’s had a high score on
neuroticism, their score on the effort scale in the condition
with high task demands was high (M=18.27, SD=0.88) as
compared to participants who scored low (M=13.61,
SD=4.08) or medium (M=12.61, SD=2.73) on neuroticism.

called TTL (for Temporal Trace Language), (cf. (Bosse et
al., 2008)) that features a dedicated editor and an automated
checker. This predicate logical temporal language supports
formal specification and analysis of dynamic properties,
covering both qualitative and quantitative aspects. TTL is
built on atoms referring to states of the world, time points
and traces, i.e. trajectories of states over time. In addition,
dynamic properties are temporal statements that can be
formulated with respect to traces based on the state ontology
Ont in the following manner. Given a trace  over state
ontology Ont, the state in  at time point t is denoted by
state(, t). These states can be related to state properties via
the formally defined satisfaction relation denoted by the
infix predicate |=, comparable to the Holds-predicate in the
Situation Calculus: state(, t) |= p denotes that state property p
holds in trace  at time t. Based on these statements,
dynamic properties can be formulated in a formal manner in
a sorted first-order predicate logic, using quantifiers over
time and traces and the usual first-order logical connectives
such as , , , , , . For more details on TTL, see
(Bosse et al., 2008).
Below, the various properties that have been verified are
listed, and the results thereof are shown. Hereby, formal
traces have been created based upon the data obtained
during the experiments. In order to reduce the
computational complexity, the traces represent 60 seconds
as one time point, whereby the averages of the observed
values during this period have been used. First, a number of
generic properties are expressed, after which they have been
checked with specific values filled in. The first property
specifies that if a certain attribute has a value above or
below a certain threshold for a particular duration, then the
value of another attribute will be positively or negatively
influenced. This is expressed in property P1.
P1(a1:attribute, s1:{<, >}, threshold:real, x:duration
a2:attribute, s2:{<,>})
For all time points t, if between time point t and time point t + x
the value of attribute a1 is {less than, greater than} a specified
threshold, and the value of a2 at time point t is v1, and the value at
time t + x is v2, then v2 is {less than, greater than} v1.

Temporal Results
Besides the statistical toolkit which has been used as
described in the previous section, another technique has
been used to look at the temporal aspects in the
measurements. Hereby, logical verification techniques have
been used to perform such an automated analysis. More
specific, the properties have been specified in a language

The property P1 seems quite abstract, but when filling in
the variables becomes quite intuitive. For example, a
property stating that a task level above a certain threshold
(e.g. 400) for a certain duration (e.g. 180 seconds) results in
a decreasing performance quality is represented as follows:
P1(task_level, >, 400, 180, performance_quality, <). In
Table 4 an overview is given of the variants of the property
above that have been verified against the empirical traces
obtained from the experiment (identified with P1.x).
Hereby, the first property P1.1 expresses that a high task
level (for 3 consecutive minutes above 300) results in an
increasing heart rate. This is seen in none of the traces. The
reason for this is that as the task level is high an initial
increase is seen in the heart rate, but this does not continue
for the whole period. Eventually the heart rate stabilizes at a
particular level. The same can be said for the second
property (P1.2) which specifies that the performance quality
goes down during a period of high task level. This property
is also never satisfied for the same reason: the performance
quality eventually stabilizes as well. Property P1.3
represents the fact that a heart rate above a certain level (in
this case 10% above the lowest value measured) entails a
decreasing performance quality. This property is satisfied in
all traces for condition 1, whereas it is satisfied in only
33.3% of the traces belonging to condition 2. When the
heart rate threshold is increased to 20% above the lowest
value (P1.4) the property is satisfied for all traces.
Besides a property expressing a certain value being above
a particular threshold, a property has also been expressed
which checks the influence of temporal trends in certain
attributes upon other attribute values. Below, the
specification of this property P2 is given:
P2(a1:attribute, s1:{<, >}, x:duration
a2:attribute, s2:{<,>})
For all time points t, if between time point t and time point t + x
the value of attribute a1 is {less than, greater than} the value of the
attribute at the previous time point, and the value of a2 at time
point t is v1, and the value at time t + x is v2, then v2 is {less than,
greater than} v1.

For example, a relation such as the fact that an increasing
task level for 180 seconds results in an increasing heart rate
can be expressed as follows: P2(task_level, >, 180,
heart_rate, >). Table 4 also shows the result of verification
of various variants of the properties that have been checked
(identified with P2.x). The relationship between the task
level increasing (for 3 minutes) and the heart rate going up
(P2.1) holds in 33.3% of the traces for condition 1, and
100% of the traces of condition 2. The latter has to do with
the fact that the task level does not increase for such a long
period in condition 2 (as the condition starts with high task
level immediately). The relation between the task level
going down, and the heart rate going down simultaneously
(P2.2) is satisfied in 66.7% of the traces for condition 1, and
in none of the traces of condition 2. The fact that it is
satisfied in condition 1 for quite some traces can be
explained by the fact that the task level in principle does not
decrease for longer periods as the task level goes from low
to high. Property P2.3 expresses that an increasing task level
results in a decreasing performance quality. This property
only holds in 33.3% of the trace, equally divided among
traces for condition 1 and traces for condition 2. The
opposite (P2.4: task level going down resulting in
performance quality going up) holds in 0% of the traces of
condition 2. In condition 1 the property is satisfied all the
time since the task level does not decrease in the condition.
The relation between the heart rate and the performance
quality is promising: if the heart rate goes up the
performance quality indeed goes down (P2.5, 83.3% of the
traces), and if the heart rate goes down, the performance
quality goes up (P2.6, 83.3% of the traces). Hereby,
condition 1 gives the best results with an accuracy of 100%
versus 66.7% for the traces concerning condition 2.

Discussion
The aim of this paper is to see whether a set of
measurements can predict the performance accurately
during a complex task. For this goal, an experiment has
been conducted in which participants performed a shooting
task. During the experiment, different measurements have
been performed. Performance was expected to be dependent
on personal characteristics (e.g. personality, expertise),
physiological measurements (heart rate) and task
complexity.
Results confirm that indeed task demands can predict
performance. Both statistical analysis and temporal analysis
(property 2.3 and 2.4) pointed out that performance
decreased when task demands were high. This effect was
also found in the subjective performance and effort
measured with the NASA-TLX, consistent with earlier
findings (e.g. Rubio et al., 2004). An unexpected result was
the fact that ambitious people perform worse with low task
demands than people who are less ambitious. This effect
may be due to the more boring character of the low task
demand parts: ambitious people could be bored easily and
are therefore not motivated to perform optimally. This is
contrary to the findings of Rose et al., 2002 who found no
relation of ambition with performance in vigilance tasks. In
future work this effect should be studied more closely.
In addition, statistical analysis shows that the average
heart rate is a good predictor for the average task demands
for both low and high task complexity, as heart rate goes up
when task complexity increases. These results confirm that
heart rate increases when more work pressure is experienced
(confirming the observations found in Roscoe 1992). People
who score high on neuroticism (the tendency to experience
more negative emotions), do not show this effect as heart
rate is high in both low and high task complexity. However,
as the NASA-TLX points out, people who are more neurotic
do contribute more effort to the task than people who are
less neurotic when complexity is high.
In this paper, the strength of temporal analysis is shown.
Not only does the temporal analysis confirm the effect of
task complexity on both performance and heart rate
(properties 2.1 to 2.4), it also reveals a more temporal
relation between heart rate and performance. This indicates
that heart rate goes up when performance goes down
(properties 2.5 and 2.6), although statistical analysis fails to
show such a relation. Results show the temporal character of
work pressure, also emphasized by Robert & Hockey (1997)
and Wilson & Russell (2003). As the temporal aspect has
good predictive possibilities, it can be used as a means to
provide optimal support in demanding circumstances.
The measurements that were taken to represent expertise
profile, namely the equation- and mouse-RT tests are not a
good representation of expertise level, since results of these
tests do not predict performance quality. In addition, no
relation was found between expertise profile and heart rate,
which says that more experienced people do not show a
lower heart rate in any part of both conditions than less
experienced participants. For future work, the expertise

profile needs to be redefined by possibly changing the tests
so they are even more similar to the actual task.
This paper shows that it is possible to predict performance
and mental/physical health from task complexity and heart
rate. And although effects of personality have to be
examined more thoroughly, this paper also shows that it is
important to take personality into account when providing
support during demanding tasks.
