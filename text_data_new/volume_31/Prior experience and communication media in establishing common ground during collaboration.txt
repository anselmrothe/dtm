In this study, we examine how these two factors affect common ground during collaborative problem solving.

or white background. The participants acquire a single perspective focusing on Objects where the objects’ color is the
opposite from the background color.
Two participants, collaborating through computer terminals, were separated by a partition so that neither could see
the partner’s display (see Figure 2). First a square frame was
presented for one second, and then the stimulus was presented
in the frame. The presentation of a frame and a stimulus is regarded as one trial (see Figure 3). It was possible to move to
the next trial by clicking on a button presented on the screen.
The participants were required to find a target rule, i.e., the
regularity of a sequence of the numbers of Objects presented
inside the frame as shown in Figure 3. The participants were
instructed to discuss the target rule and press the termination
button presented on their screen when they reached the solution. In addition, the participants were required to examine at
least 30 trials before they reached the solution. The instruction was stressed that the stimuli presented inside the frame
are identical with each other.

Goal of our study and hypothesis
Our goal is to investigate the next two points:
1. If the establishment of common ground leads to successful
problem solving,
2. How the two factors, communication experience between
the members and the richness of media connecting them,
affect the establishment of common ground.
Our hypotheses are as follows.
H1: The establishment of common ground enhances successful problem solving.
H2: Communication experience between the members enhances the establishment of common ground and, as a result, successful problem solving.
H3: Rich communication media enhances the establishment
of common ground and successful problem solving.

Experiment paradigm
In our study, we use an experimental paradigm designed by
Hayashi et al. (2006). In this paradigm, two participants engage in a rule discovery task, and each of them engages in
the task with a different perspective. While solving the task,
each of the participants confronts miscommunication about
the other’s perspective and has to manage to overcome this
situation.

Figure 2: Experimental situation

Controlling the participants’ perspective
We controlled the degree of tendency of focusing on each of
two different colored surfaces as an experimental stimulus to
manipulate the participants’ perspectives based on the Gestalt
psychological principles (Koffka, 1935). As shown in Figure
1, we constructed stimuli where white and black unit squares
are randomly arranged on a six × six grid.

Figure 3: Series of presented stimuli

Manipulating miscommunication
Next, we explain how to manipulate a sequence of the numbers of Objects to create miscommunication. In the introductory phase, the participants are led to have one of the distributed perspectives: i.e., either a perspective focusing on
black Objects or one focusing on white. After this phase, the
conflict phase follows where the participants are required to
integrate the two distributed perspectives to discover the target rule (See Table 1).
Figure 1: Example of stimuli

Introductory phase The sum of the numbers of white and
black Objects is manipulated to rotate, such as between 6, 8,
10, and 12. Under this constraint, each number of the white
(or black) Objects also individually rotates such as between
3, 4, 5, and 6. In the introductory phase, even though the two
participants have different perspectives (focusing on a black

We call each surface comprising the white and black
squares an Object. In an example stimulus in Figure 1, there
is a total of ten Objects comprising five black Objects and five
white Objects. This stimulus is displayed on either a black

527

or white Object), miscommunication does not occur between
the two participants because each continuously reports the
identical rotation of the numbers (i.e. 3, 4, 5, and 6) to the
other. Additionally, in this phase they expect not to notice
that they have different perspectives.

Table 2: Experimental conditions and participants
Media

Conflict phase After the seventeenth trial, the sum of the
numbers of black and white Objects keeps rotating; however,
the number of individual colored Objects is controlled so that
when the participants focus on only one of the two colors,
they do not report the same numbers and miscommunication occurs. For example, in Table 1, the regularity of the
sequence of black Objects has ceased, such as with 2, 2, 6,
and 5; and the sequence of white Objects has become 4, 6, 4
and 7. Although in the conflict phase, the circulation of the
sum of the numbers of Objects remains as 6, 8, 10, and 12,
the rotation of the numbers of both black and white Objects
irregularly changes against the sequence of 3, 4, 5, and 6. To
discover the sequence of 6, 8, 10, and 12, as the target rule,
the participants have to integrate the two distributed perspectives.

Phase one In this phase, we controlled the experience factor. We used a tangram task where the participants were instructed to create several types of tangram figures by combining different, small pieces within 20 minutes. In the experience condition, the participants created the tangram figures
together while conversing with the partner via computer terminals. On the other hand, conversation was prohibited in
the no experience condition, and the participants created the
tangram figures independently.
Phase two In this phase, we controlled the media factor. In
the conversation condition, the participants were able to talk
with the partner while they engaged in the task. On the other
hand, in the chat condition, the participants engaged in the
task while using the chat system implemented on the experimental system. This chat system was set up so that the participants were able to exchange their messages alternatively.
The time limit of this phase was 40 minutes.
After the task, in order to examine the performance of
problem solving, i.e., finding the target rule, the experimenter
asked the participants their inferred rule individually. For protocol analysis, we recorded the participants’ conversation in
the conversation condition, and recorded the dialogs in the
system in the chat condition.

Experiment design
Controlled factors
The experiment has a two × two between-subjects factorial
design. The two factors, communication experience between
the participants and the richness of media, were experimentally manipulated. The first factor was controlled by manipulating whether or not the participants had communication experience prior to the rule discovery task explained above. In
the following, we call this factor the experience factor. The
condition with communication experience is called the experience condition, and the condition without communication
experience is called the no experience condition. The second factor was controlled by manipulating whether the participants engaged in the task with oral conversation or chatting
via computer terminals. In the following, we call this factor the media factor. The condition of communication with
conversation is called the conversation condition and the condition of chatting is called the chat condition.

Phase three In this phase, we conducted a questionnaire
to investigate the establishment of common ground. In this
questionnaire, the participants’ understanding was tested on
how precisely they understood the arrangement of Objects on
their partner’s screen. In particular, to the participants an arrangement of Objects on their own screen was presented to
the participants on the questionnaire sheet, and an arrangement of Objects on the partner’s screen was required to be
drawn. When the participants drew the partner’s screen precisely, we conclude that they established common ground.

Criterion of problem solving and common ground
In our task, successful problem solving means to discover the
target rule; in other words, the participants answered the target rule correctly at the final stage of Phase Two. On the other
hand, the establishment of common ground means that the
participants understood their partner’s perspective correctly;
more concretely, the participants drew the partner’s screen
precisely in Phase Three. Therefore, from this criterion, we
examine hypothesis H1, that the establishment of common
ground enhances successful problem solving.

Participants
Eighty-eight undergraduates participated in the experiment
(males = 37, females = 51, M age = 18.47 years). All participants were randomly assigned to each condition. Table 2
shows the number of participants assigned to each condition.

Procedure

Analysis was performed for each individual, not in pairs.

The experiment is composed of three phases.

Establishment of common ground and successful
problem solving

Performance on establishment of common ground
We analyzed the ratio of the participants who successfully
established common ground. Figure 6 indicates the result of
the establishment of common ground. The vertical axis represents the ratio of the participants who established common
ground, i.e., correctly answered the questionnaire conducted
in Phase Three, and the horizontal axis represents each experimental condition.
Here, we conducted the same ANOVA using the χ2 distribution. There was a significant main effect in both the
factor of experience and media (χ2 (1) = 9.045, p < .01;
χ2 (1) = 2.26, p < .01). The ratio of successful common
ground in the experience condition was higher than that in
the no experience condition, and the ratio in the conversation was also higher than that in the chat condition. In addition, there was a marginal interaction between the two factors
(χ2 (1) = 2.73, p = .09). The main effects of the two factors indicate that both the communication experience between
the participants and the richness of media improve the establishment of common ground. The results of performance on
problem solving and the establishment of common ground
support our hypotheses H2 and H3.

Figure 4 indicates the relationship between the establishment
of common ground and successful problem solving.
Here, we divided the participants into two groups: the participants who established common ground and those who did
not; in each group of the participants, we calculated the ratio of successful problem solving. Fisher’s exact test shows
a statistical difference in the ratio of successful problem
solving depending on the establishment of common ground
(p < .01). This indicates that there was a correlation between
the achievement of common ground and success in problem
solving. This result supports our hypothesis H1.

Performance on problem solving
Figure 5 indicates the performance of problem solving. The
vertical axis represents the ratio of the participants who succeeded in problem solving, and the horizontal axis represents
each experimental condition. Our interest is to investigate
how the two factors, experience and media, influence the performance. Therefore, we conducted an ANOVA using the χ2
distribution based on the arcsine transformation method. This
method enables detecting both the main effects and interaction of the two experimental factors.
The analysis was performed by a two × two ANOVA with
the factor of experience (experience condition vs. no experience condition) and the factor of media (conversation condition vs. chat condition) as a between-subject factor. There
was a main effect in both the factor of experience and media
(χ2 (1) = 13.72, p < .01; χ2 (1) = 34.52, p < .01). The performance in the experience condition was better than that in
the no experience condition, and the performance in the conversation condition was also better than that in the chat condition. In addition, there was a marginal interaction between
the two factors (χ2 (1) = 3.68, p = .055).
The main effects of the two factors indicate that the communication experience between the participants and the richness of media actually contribute to successful problem solving.

Discussion and conclusions
Our goal was to investigate the following two points: (1) if the
establishment of common ground leads to successful problem
solving, and (2) how the two factors, communication experience and richness of media, affect the establishment of common ground.

529

We conducted a psychological experiment to investigate
the above points. The results indicate as follows: (1) the establishment of common ground enhances successful problem
solving, (2) communication experience between the members
improves the establishment of common ground and as a result
enhances successful problem solving, and (3) rich communication media enhances the establishment of common ground
and successful problem solving. We discuss the results in the
following.

1974). We assume that the enforcement of this turn taking
influenced the failure in establishment of common ground.
In addition, the marginal interaction of the two factors, experience and media, implies that the performance in the chat
situation without prior communication experience decreases
remarkably compared to the other conditions. To investigate
this in detail, we analyzed the process of the establishment
of common ground by conducting the protocol analysis. In
particular, we focus on the protocols mentioning the color of
Objects and the background color of the display. The protocols about the numbers directly relate to communication for
solving the problem, i.e., finding the target rule. On the other
hand, the protocols about the colors are interpreted as the efforts for establishing common ground, i.e., understanding the
partner’s situation.
Figure 7 indicates the efforts for establishing common
ground. The vertical axis represents the ratio of sentences
referring to the colors to all sentences. The horizontal axis
represents each experimental condition.

Establishment of common ground and success in
problem solving
The results indicated that there was a correlation between
the establishment of common ground and success in problem
solving; that is, the establishment of common ground led to
successful problem solving.
An interesting point is that, just to solve this task rationally, the establishment common ground is not an essential
qualification. The most important information to solve the
task is the numbers of Objects. It is not necessarily required
to understand the partner’s perspective because it is possible
to solve the problem by exchanging only information about
the numbers of Objects. In spite of this, the participants tried
to resolve miscommunication and to understand the partner’s
perspective, and eventually they established common ground
and succeeded in problem solving.
Now, we discuss why the establishment of common ground
enhanced successful problem solving. It is assumed that efforts to establish common ground aroused an intention to
bring in the partner’s perspective, and as a result the participants integrated the two perspectives, focusing on information given from the partner. The credibility of statements of
the partner decreased in the initial stage of the conflict phase
because miscommunication occurred. But as the participants
deepened their understandings of the partner’s perspective
through establishing common ground, the credibility of the
partner’s statements increased. As a result, the participants
focused on both colors and eventually found the target rule.
On the other hand, when the participants could not understand
the partner’s perspective, the credibility of statements of the
partner remained low. This may inhibit the attitude of trying to consider information from the partner. As a result, the
participants could not find the target rule because they did not
integrate the black and white Objects considering information
from the partner.

Figure 7: Efforts for establishing common ground
The analysis was performed by a two × two ANOVA with
the factor of experience (experience condition vs. no experience condition) and the factor of media (conversation condition vs. chat condition) as a between-subject factor. The interaction between the two factors, experience and media, was
significant (F(1, 84) = 7.16, p < .01). An analysis of the simple main effect was conducted in each level of the media factor. In the conversation condition, the ratio of protocols mentioning the colors between the experience and no experience
conditions was not significantly different (F(1, 84) = 1.68,
p = .2). On the other hand, in the chat condition, the ratio
was significantly higher in the experience condition than that
in the no experience condition (F(1, 84) = 25.8, p < .01).
The results indicate that in the chat condition the participants’ protocols about the colors definitely decreased when
they did not experience prior communication. Based on the
above discussion, it is assumed that the reason the performance decreased in the chat without communication experience may be because the process for establishing common
ground did not emerge in such a situation.

Media
The main effect of the media factor indicates that it was difficult to establish common ground in the chat condition compared to the conversation condition. The chat system was
designed so that the turn taking during conversation was permitted only alternatively. Therefore, the participants’ turn
taking in the chat condition was more enforced and communication was difficult compared to the conversation condition.
It is pointed out that turn taking is an essential factor that organizes human conversation (Sacks, Scheglioff, & Jefferson,

Communication experience

mon ground. When no verbal communication was experienced, the establishment of common ground was difficult
because inadequate recognition of the partner’s situation appeared due to the lack of communication experience between
the participants.
In CMC (Computer Mediated Communication), we often
face opportunities to communicate with someone we don’t
know. It has been pointed out that discussion in CMC sometimes degenerates into defamatory exchanges. This phenomenon is called Framing (Sproull & Kiesler, 1991). We
assume that this is an example phenomenon that occurs by
inadequate recognition of the partner due to the lack of communication experience. This false recognition about the partner in such a situation leads to preconceived impressions that
are not based on facts. Based on this view, in our experiment
we examine which types of inadequate recognition about the
partner’s situation appear especially in the no verbal communication condition. To do so, we analyzed the pictures drawn
in the questionnaire sheet by the participants who were not
able to establish common ground.
As a result, we found the typical incorrect figures shown
in Figure 8. In the pictures, the colors of Objects, which are
supposed to be physically identical, changed oppositely. This
picture contradicts the instruction that each stimulus inside
the frame for one participant is identical to the other stimulus
for the partner. This drawing is interpreted as the deviation
from the instruction. Figure 9 indicates the ratio of the participants who drew such an incorrect picture indicated in Figure
8. The vertical axis represents the ratio of the participants
who drew the incorrect picture. The horizontal axis represents each experimental condition.

We conducted an ANOVA by using the χ2 distribution. The
ANOVA indicates that neither the interaction nor the main
effect of the media factor was significant (χ2 (1) = 0.2, p =
.65; χ2 (1) = 0.001, p = .98). On the other hand, there was a
main effect of the experience factor. This indicates that more
incorrect drawings emerged in the no experience condition
than in the experience condition (χ2 (1) = 4.81, p < .05). The
result shows that the lack of prior communication experience
brings about this kind of serious inadequate recognition of the
partner’s situation, and this eventually leads to the difficulties
for establishing common ground.
