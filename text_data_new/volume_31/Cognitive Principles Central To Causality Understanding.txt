Abstract
Many studies in the psychological literature focus on the
distinctive features of physical and psychological causality
understanding. Our aim is a preliminary study from a
different perspective, looking for similarities in the two
domains.
The results of Experiment 1 (38 adults
participants) confirm our prediction: some features of the
perceptual stimulus affect causality understanding in both
the physical and the psychological domain. Also, the results
of Experiment 2 (16 autistic children and 16 controls)
confirm a clinical prediction deriving from our assumption.
Autistic individuals, who are notoriously impaired in
understanding psychological causality, turn out to be
impaired also in understanding physical causality.
Keywords: Causality understanding; physical causality;
psychological causality.

Introduction
The notion of causality is central in both the physical and
the psychological domains. In the physical realm, the
rotation movement of the Earth causes the alternation of
night and day, while in the psychological domain the
defying glance of a child causes her friend’s wild reaction.
In the physical domain, particular attention was devoted to
simple launching events such as a billiard ball colliding with
and launching another billiard ball – i.e., the same kind of
events notoriously studied by the philosopher Hume
(1741/1978). Two centuries later, Piaget (1955) studied how
children develop causality understanding. An important
finding in the most recent literature is that individuals are
sensitive to the contingency or temporal contiguity between
pairings of a cause and an effect. In other words, cause and
effect must be temporally contiguous in order to generate a
judgement of causality. A 0.5 seconds delay between an
action and its outcome suffices to decrease causality
perception in young infants (see, e.g., Spelke, Phillips &
Woodward, 1995). In adults, Michotte (1963) observed that
the perceptual system assumes cause-effect relations in the
absence of contradictory evidence such as the lack of
temporal or spatial contiguity, even when there is no real
object.
In the psychological domain, many studies attempted to
understand which perceptual features trigger the perception

of agents. Baron-Cohen (1995), for example, purported the
existence of the Mindreading System, a cognitive
mechanism detecting complex psychological causes of
action. One component of the system is the Intentionality
Detector (ID), a specialized perceptual mechanism detecting
an agent’s goal. Other studies evidenced that eyes are
fundamental social and psychological stimuli. It is from the
presence of eyes that we immediately recognize agents, and
we spontaneously tend to “read” mental states in the eyes of
someone. According to Baron-Cohen (1995), eye-like
stimuli trigger the Eye Direction Detector (EDD)
component of the Mindreading System, that computes the
direction of the gaze, finding what the eyes are looking at.
ID and EDD trigger SAM (Shared Attention Mechanism),
which detects mutual attention and communicative
situations. The assumption of specialized mechanisms
involved in psychological causality is enforced by clinical
data that can be read in terms of an impairment in such a
mechanism.
In
particular,
causal
psychological
understanding is notoriously impaired in autism (see, e.g.,
Klin, 2000, Klin, Volkmar & Sparrow, 1992). Autistic
people generally do not understand the psychological state
expressed by a particular glance, nor they understand that a
person wants what she is looking at (Baron-Cohen et al.,
2001). At a higher level, they do not understand that beliefs
cause behavior. On the contrary, autism is not regarded as a
syndrome that impairs physical causality understanding
(Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1986).
Some studies revealed a precocious ability to differentiate
agents from objects in causal events. For example,
Woodward and colleagues (1993) found evidence that 7month-old infants make a distinction between mechanical
forces and animate sources of motion. On the whole, those
experimental data show that people not only have
precocious causal understanding in both the physical and
psychological domains, but also know that the two realms
are governed by different principles. An interesting question
thus concerns the relation of the two domains of knowledge.
Some authors tend to see causal understanding in the
physical and
psychological domains as completely
separated. According to Leslie (1994), for example, the
cognitive mechanism ToBy (Theory of Body Mechanism)

2735

allows us to understand the physical notion of force, while
ToMM1 (Theory of Mind Mechanism 1) and ToMM2
(Theory of Mind Mechanism 2) are the bases of
psychological understanding. Also, the Mindreading System
proposed by Baron-Cohen (1995) is triggered by
specifically agentive stimuli, such as eyes and selfpropelled movement. Gelman, Durgin and Kaufman (1995)
purport a different view. They claim that there exist
numerous skeletal causal principles that organize attention
to and learning about the animate-inanimate distinction.
Perceiving a particular kind of movement is neither
necessary nor sufficient to identify causal situations: other
conceptual information, such as those concerning the
transmission of force and the respect of specific naïve
physical principles, are also considered (see also Leslie &
Keeble, 1987; Spelke, 1994).

Cognitive Principles of Causality
Understanding

Experiment 1: Evidence for Aspects Common
to Physical and Psychological Causality
judgments
The adults participants in the experiment were invited to
watch some video-taped animations and to answer, for each
animation, two questions (translated from Italian): 1) “Are
those moving on the screen characters or objects?”, 2) “Do
they move independently or they interact?”. We combined
the answers to the two questions and we coded them as
follows:
• Objects that move independently: chance event.
• Objects that move dependently: physical causality.
• Characters
moving
independently:
private
psychological causality.
• Characters moving dependently: communicative
psychological causality.

Method

In line with Gelman and colleagues (1995), we assume that
numerous factors contribute to causality understanding.
From this perspective our study looks for possible factors
playing a major role in both the physical and the
psychological domains. We considered interactive situations
more complex than those situations typically investigated in
the literature; we explored both judgments of physical and
psychological causality and, within the two categories, two
further sub-categories. As regards physical events, we
allowed for the possibility to judge it as an instance of either
a chance event or an event of physical causality. As regards
psychological events, we allowed for the possibility to
evaluate them as instances of private psychological
causality or communicative psychological causality. With
private psychological causality we refer to a situation where
the agents act on their own, with no communicative intent.
With communicative psychological causality we refer to a
situation where at least one agent acts with the intention to
communicate something to others (Grice, 1989).
A main assumption of our investigation was that
psychological causality judgements may be affected by the
same features of the perceptual stimulus as physical
causality judgements are. In particular, as contact and
temporal contiguity, compared with no contact and no
temporal contiguity, distinguishes between a physical
causality event and a chance event, we expected them to
distinguish between two different kinds of psychological
causality judgment, i.e., communicative and private. From
our assumption another important prediction follows. If
some cognitive principles are central to both the physical
and the psychological domains, then autistic people should
also have difficulties in physical causality understanding.

Thirty-six students at Turin University participated in the
experiment (7 males and 29 females: mean age 23 years).
They were students attending a course of General
Psychology and voluntarily accepted to take part in the
experiment. The experimental material consisted of 12
video-animations all sharing the same structure. Each
animation involved two billiard balls of the same size
(diameter: 110 pixels) and started with a ball standing at ¾
of the visible area (on the right side of the screen); let us call
it the first ball. After 1 second another ball, let us call it the
second ball, which was not visible at the beginning of the
animation, arrived from the left side of the screen (speed:
18.1 cm/sec in a 14-inch television set). Only at this point
the first ball moved through the right side of the screen and
exited. Each animation ended with the ball that entered the
screen resting in the place where originally stopped. The
twelve video-animations differed according to the following
variables: presence of eyes or not; ocular contact or not;
physical contact or not; temporal contiguity of 0.5 seconds
or not. In the “no contact” condition, the second ball
stopped before arriving at the central part of the screen.
Figure 1 illustrates a photogram of an animation (i.e., an
instance of animation involving eyes, eye contact, physical
contact).

presence of eyes, eye contact and physical contact.

2736

The 12 animations were arranged in four different random
orders and the participants were casually assigned to one of
the four randomizations, for a total of 9 participants in each
randomization. The experiment was carried out individually,
in a quiet room. Participants were told that the experiment
was concerned with how individuals judge brief animations.
Each animation was presented twice; once after the first
question, once after the second question.

Results and Discussion
For a conservative analysis, which allows us to consider
how globally the variables we considered affected
individuals’ judgments, we carried out a series of log-linear
analyses. If we consider all the variables with the exception
of eye contact (the animations without eyes do not feature
this variable), the STEPWISE log-linear analysis selects as
the best model (LR χ2 (df=12): 7.84, p=.80) the model in
which judgments were affected by the variable eyes (see
Table 1) and by the interaction between physical contact and
temporal contiguity (Table 2).

causality. When there was no temporal contiguity, and there
was not physical contact, participants judged the events as
either a chance event or private psychological causality.
Let us consider only the animations with eyes (for them
we can consider the variable eye contact); the STEPWISE
log-linear analysis selects as the best model the model in
which judgments were affected by the interrelation between
physical contact and temporal contiguity (LR χ2 (df=16):
15.02, p=.52); see Table 3). In case of temporal contiguity
and physical contact, participants tended to judge the event
as either physical causality or psychological causality. In
case of no temporal contiguity and no physical contact,
participants tended to judge the event as private
psychological in the psychological realm.

From Table 1 we can consider that animations without the
eyes lead participants to judge the event as pertaining to the
physical domain, whereas the presence of the eyes led to
judge the event as an instance of causality in the
psychological domain.

We conclude that some features of the perceptual stimulus
affected individuals’ judgments of causality both in the
physical and the psychological domains. In particular, our
global results reveal that physical contact and temporal
contiguity were essential to distinguish between a chance
event and physical causality in the realm of objects
(animations without eyes), and between private
psychological causality and communicative psychological
causality in the realm of agents (animations with eyes).

Experiment 2 was devised to test a clinical prediction.
Autistic children, who are impaired in psychological
causality understanding, ought to be impaired also in
physical causality understanding. The experimental
procedure of this study (see below) allowed us to overcome
a limit of Experiment 1, which did not discriminate between
communicative psychological causality and physical
causality involving agents in animations with eyes. An
agent could cause the movement of another agent
unintentionally.

Table 2 shows that, independently on the presence of the
eyes, when there was temporal contiguity, and there was
physical contact, participants judged the event as either
physical causality or communicative psychological

Method
The experimental group consisted of sixteen children (12
males and 4 females: mean age: 8;9) with a diagnosis
pertaining to the autistic spectrum according to the DSM-IV

2737

and the ICD-10. In particular, 8 children were autistic, 4 had
a pervasive disease of the development non otherwise
specified, and 4 had Asperger syndrome. Their non verbal
mental age - as measured by the Brief IQ (BIQ) Screening
Assessment from the Leiter International Performance Scale
Revised (Roid & Miller, 1997) - was 6;9 years, and their
verbal mental age - as measured by the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test Revised (Dunn & Dunn, 1981) - was 6;7
years. Children were all attending the Center for autism of
the Local Sanitary Health Authority of Cuneo.
The control group consisted of sixteen non-autistic
children attending the local schools of Cuneo. They were
comparable to the autistic children for sex and verbal mental
age (12 males and 4 females: mean verbal mental age: 6;7
years). We assumed also a match of the two groups of
participants on non verbal mental age.
Children were presented with a theory of mind test and
with the causality test we devised. The theory of mind test
was intended to ascertain that our autistic children were
impaired in theory of mind tasks like the autistic children
described in the literature. We used the classical Sally and
Ann test (Baron-Cohen, Leslie & Frith, 1985), presented
through a series of 5 vignettes. There were two doll
protagonists, Sally and Anne. Sally first placed a marble
into her basket. Then she left the scene, and the marble was
transferred by Anne and hidden in her box. Then, when
Sally returned, the experimenter asked the critical Belief
Question: “Where will Sally look for her marble?”. If the
children point to the previous location of the marble, then
they pass the Belief Question by appreciating the doll’s now
false belief. If however, they point to the marble’s current
location, then they fail the question by not taking into
account the doll’s belief. These conclusions are warranted if
two control questions are answered correctly: “Where is the
marble really?” (Reality Question); “Where was the marble
in the beginning?” (Memory Question).
The causality test consisted of 6 of the 12 animations used
in Experiment 1. In particular, we focused our attention on
the crucial animations for investigating the relationship
between physical contact and temporal contiguity (see
Tables 4 and 5). The experimental procedure was slightly
different from the procedure used in Experiment 1.
Participants were told that they were going to see characters
when presented with animations with eyes, and they were
told that they were going to see objects when presented with
animations without eyes. This procedure was meant to
detect situations in which, while knowing that animations
involved agents, children still attribute physical causality.
Each of the 6 animations was presented twice, but not on
consecutive trials, for a total of 12 animations (12 trials).
Also, each trial involving an animation with agents required
the participant to answer two questions, and for this reason
the animation was presented twice within a trial. Each
question and each possible answer was written on a piece of
paper and read aloud by the experimenter. The first question
was common to both animations, with and without eyes:
‘Does one move the other or they move by themselves?”. In

case of animations without eyes, the answer discriminates
between physical causality and a chance event. In case of
animations with eyes, the situation is different. Indeed, it is
possible for someone to recognize two stimuli as agents and
to interpret their interaction as physical causality, as when
one person unwillingly pushes the other. Thus, in case of
agents, the first question was followed by a second one:
‘Does the [COLOR OF BALL ON THE SCENE SINCE THE
BEGINNING] ball move because the [COLOR OF THE BALL
ENTERING THE SCENE AFTERWARDS] ball want it?’.
Depending on the answers to the two questions, we coded
participants’ interpretations of the animation involving
agents as follows:
• Character/one moves the other/did not want:
physical causality
• Character/one
moves
the
other/wanted:
communicative psychological causality
• Character/they move by themselves: private
psychological causality

Results and Discussion
In the false belief task the participants behaved according to
the literature in that autistic children performed poorly (see,
e.g., Baron-Cohen et al., 1985; Leslie & Frith, 1988). Only
4 of the 16 autistic children answered correctly both the
Reality and the Memory questions, and of these 4 children
only 1 answered correctly the Belief question. As regards
the control group, 7 of the 16 children answered correctly
both the Reality and the Memory questions, and of these 7
children 6 answered correctly the Belief question. Hence,
children in the control group outperformed children in the
experimental group (Mann-Whitney test: z=2.21, p<.04). As
regards the causality test, Table 4 and 5 summarize the
percentages of typologies of judgment by the autistic and
the control group, respectively.

A series of bi-nomial tests (with an a priori probability of
½) reveals what follows for the animations involving
objects (animations number 5 and 6), the only animations
having normative correct judgments according to the
literature. As regards the event in problem 6 (no physical
contact, no temporal contiguity), the normative correct

2738

judgment is chance. As expected, children in the control
group were more accurate with this problem than children in
the autistic group (Mann-Whitney test: z= 1.86, tied
p=<.05). Children in the control group judged the event in
problem 6 as an instance of chance, whereas autistic
children were divided between judgments of physical
causality and chance, and there was no a difference
statistically significant between the frequencies in the
production of the two sorts of judgment (Wilcoxon test:
z=1, tied p= .25). The event in problem 5 (physical contact
and temporal contiguity) is prototypic of physical causality;
the normative correct judgment is physical causality. Again,
as expected, children in the control group were more
accurate with this problem than children in the autistic
group (Mann-Whitney test: z= 3.2, tied p=<.002). Children
in the control group judged the event as physical causality.
Autistic children, instead, divided themselves between
judgments of chance and physical causality, and there was
no a difference statistically significant between the
frequencies in the production of the two typologies of
judgment (Wilcoxon test: z=.71, tied p= .36).

As regards the animations involving agents (animations
with eyes, i.e., number 1 to 4), a series of bi-nomial test
(with an a priori probability of ¼ for judgments of physical
causality and private psychological causality, and an a
priori probability of ½ for judgments of communicative
psychological causality) reveals what follows. Autistic
children interpreted all the animations as instances of
communicative psychological causality, whereas children in
the control group did not. This result is new in the literature;
it implies that autistic children, as compared to children in
the control group, overrated causal interactions as
communicative. In particular, this result holds for ‘pure’
autistic children, as well as for children with a pervasive
disease of the development non otherwise specified, and
children with Asperger syndrome (a mean of 2.9 and 2.8
judgments of communicative psychological causality,
respectively). Children in the control group were sensitive
to the interrelations of the variables temporal contiguity and
physical contact. Only in absence of physical contact and
temporal contiguity (see problems 2 and 4), children in the
control group judged the event as an instance of

communicative psychological causality. On the contrary, in
case of physical contact and temporal contiguity (see
problems 1 and 3), they judged the event as an instance of
private psychological causality. These results reveal a
pattern which is contrary with respect to that revealed by
adults’ results in Experiment 1. We have some tentative
explanations (see the General Discussion).
The global results of the experiment confirmed the
predictions deriving from our assumptions. First, differences
in performance between the autistic children and the non
autistic children were traceable in both causal domains.
Most important, the autistic population was poor in physical
causality understanding. Second, in the case of agents, with
physical contact and temporal contiguity autistic children
envisaged communicative intentions more than children in
the control group did.

General Discussion
In our investigation we looked for possible factors that
might interact in producing causality judgments in the
physical and in the psychological domains. The focus of our
investigation were launching events. The results of
Experiment 1 confirmed our predictions: some features of
the perceptual stimulus influence judgments of causality in
both the physical and the psychological domain. In
particular, physical contact and absence of temporal
contiguity are essential to distinguish between chance
events and physical causality among objects, and between
private psychological causality and communicative
psychological causality among agents. These results are not
easily reconcilable with those of Woodward, Phillips and
Spelke (1993). Their children had not specific expectation
of contact with human agents. More in general, the authors
purported that infants may have a separate set of principles
to guide their reasoning about human action. In our view, it
is possible that previous studies like the one by the authors
failed to find similarities between judgments of physical and
psychological causality because they focused on the role of
single variables rather than on their interactions in
producing causality judgments in the two domains.
Also the results of Experiment 2 confirmed our
expectations: in the physical domain autistic children were
poorer than controls in understanding physical causality.
More in general, differences in performance between the
autistic and the normal children were traceable in both
causal domains.
The results of our experiments, along with those in the
literature, let us envisage several ways to further investigate
into causality understanding. First, both experiments suggest
that the interrelation between physical contact and temporal
contiguity is relevant to understanding causality in both the
physical and the psychological domain. Nevertheless, in
Experiment 1 the presence of physical contact and temporal
contiguity lead to judgments of communicative
psychological causality, whereas in Experiment 2 judgments
of communicative psychological causality were produced in
absence of those two variables. There are at least two

2739

possible explanations. One is the difference in the
experimental procedures used in the two experiments, the
other is the different age of the participants in the two
experiments. A replication of Experiment 2 on subjects
older than 7 years could discriminate between the two
possibilities. Second, since the participants in our
experiments had to provide simple Yes/No answers to
questions about whether agents/objects were involved in the
animations,
and
whether
they
moved
dependently/independently, future studies should investigate
how subjects spontaneously interpret similar situations.
Finally, although in Experiment 2 neither autistics nor
controls were affected by the variable eye contact, autistics
seem to have noticed the presence of the eyes in the
animations and to have taken this kind of stimuli as a cue of
a communicative interaction. This results contrast with
those in the literature (see, e.g., Klin, 2000; Klin &
Volkmar, 1995, 1997). A possible explanation relies in the
experimental material we used; we used simplified stimuli
characterized by oversized eyes, but lacking other elements
that constitute the human face: the nose, the mouth, the ears,
etc. Also, such simplified stimuli are presented in dyadic,
rather than complex, social interactions. Our simplified
stimuli might have resulted in a more salient presence of the
eyes for autistic children. It would be interesting to verify
whether a specific training using such a stimuli could
improve
autistics’
sensitivity
to
psychological
interpretations
in
more
complex
and
realistic
communicative situations.
