Individual differences in implicit learning: Is Reber wrong?
Ingmar Visser
University of Amsterdam
Abstract: Reber (1989) hypothesized that implicit learning is an evoluonarily old system. From this idea, Reber
deduced a number of predictions: 1) IL should not vary with age or IQ, 2) IL should be robust in the face of
interfering tasks and (certain) forms of neurological damage. Siegert et al (2006) used a meta-analysis to show that
Parkinson’s patients have important deficits in IL. In the current study we performed meta-analyses in three pools of
IL studies: 1) studies with dual tasks, resulting in considerable differences between IL with and without dual tasks;
2) studies into age differences, indicating that there is no relationship between IL ability and age (although there
was a trend towards a curvi-linear relationship); 3) studies into IL and IQ, indicating a correlation between IQ and
implicit learning abilities. Hence three of four results are inconsistent with Reber’s predictions.
