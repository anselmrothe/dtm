Abstract
Symbolic cues have always been thought to elicit voluntary
orienting of attention. Arrows, as well as other centrally
presented cues, could lead to reflexive shifts of attention,
without showing, however, the biphasic pattern (initial
facilitation / later inhibition) typical of peripheral automatic
orienting. This study evaluated the role of awareness in
endogenous orienting of attention, in order to understand
whether it is necessary for either automatic or voluntary
orienting, or both. Results showed a facilitation at brief cuetarget intervals in both the aware and unaware conditions; a
tendency to inhibition at longer intervals for non-predictive
arrows, but only in the aware condition; a facilitation with no
inhibition for predictive arrows, in both the aware and
unaware conditions. Our results suggest that arrows can cause
automatic shifts of endogenous attention, which can be
triggered by unconsciously perceived cues, implying that
awareness is not necessary for automatic attention to occur.
Keywords: spatial orienting; attention; arrows; symbolic
cues; automatic; unconscious perception.

Introduction
Since Posner (1980) suggested the dissociation between
endogenous and exogenous orienting of attention, it has
been assumed that symbolic, centrally presented cues, yield
to voluntary shifts of attention, while peripheral abrupt
onset cues elicit automatic shifts of attention.
It is possible to observe the automatic orienting in a
peripheral cueing task, even though cues are not consciously
perceived (McCormick, 1997; Ivanoff & Klein, 2003;
Lambert et al., 1999). McCormick (1997) instructed
participants to reorient their attention toward the opposite
location of a non-perceived peripheral cue. Results showed
faster RT (facilitation) for target appearing at the cued
location with brief stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) and
slower RT (inhibition of return, IOR) with longer SOA.
Neither reorientation following predictive cues McCormick
(1997), nor IOR in a non-predictive paradigm (Ivanoff &
Klein, 2003; Lambert et al., 1999) has been found, with notconsciously perceived cues.
However, Casagrande, Mereu, Martella and Marotta
(2006), showed facilitation at the location indicated by a
centrally presented and predictive arrow, which was
invisible due to visual masking suggesting that even
voluntary orienting could be elicited unconsciously.
However, it has been suggested that arrows (Tipples, 2002),

as well as other types of central cues like eye gaze (Friesen
and Kingstone, 1998), may trigger a reflexive orienting of
attention because they can elicit shifts of attention even
though they are not predictive of the target onset location.
So, the shifting of attention found in Casagrande et al.,
(2006) studies can be ascribed to automatic instead of
voluntary orienting.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of awareness
in endogenous orienting of attention, in order to understand
whether it is necessary for either automatic or voluntary
orienting, or both.

Experiment 1
The results found in Casagrande et al., (2006) seem to
suggest what was proposed earlier (e.g. Warner et al., 1990),
that both a voluntary and an automatic component coexist in
the endogenous orienting of attention. Otherwise, one
should accept the idea that either voluntary orienting could
be elicited by not consciously perceived cues or that the
endogenous orienting of attention is not voluntary at all.
This last case would bring into question almost 30 years of
modeling of attention, which claims that endogenous is
voluntary.
It is possible that if the orienting of attention found in
Casagrande et al. (2006) study using a centrally presented
cue is the product of an automatic orienting mechanism, the
same results could be observed in a non informative
paradigm where the cue is not a reliable predictor of the
target onset location.
In order to verify this hypothesis, we conducted an
experiment in which the cues (arrows) were non-predictive
of the target location and we gave no instruction about the
cue to naïve observers who never participated in a cueing
task before. Showing an effect on non predictive, central,
masked cues would confirm that the endogenous orienting
has an automatic component, which could occur in the
absence of awareness, in line with studies that showed a
reflexive orienting after non-consciously perceived
peripheral cues (McCormick, 1997; Ivanoff and Klein,
2003; Lambert et al., 1999).

Method
Participants Sixteen right handed students with normal or
corrected-to-normal vision (age 25.7; ± DS: 2.56)
participated in the experiment after signing a consent form.

Stimuli and procedure The spatial cue was a dark grey
arrow or a circle (1°). The cue appeared in one of 5 possible
locations, each one delimited by a squared box (3°). One
was located in the center of the display and the others, on
the left, on the right, above or below the center, at 5°
eccentricity. The mask, similar to the one introduced by
Enns and Di Lollo (1997), consisted of 4 small dots (0,2°)
arranged in an imaginary square (2.8°) centered in each box.
The target was a black circle, the same size of the cue,
which could appear in only 2 of the 5 boxes, on the left or
on the right of the display. All the stimuli were presented on
a light grey background. The sequence (Figure 1) started
with the fixation box. After 500 ms the 5 boxes appeared
and stayed for the entire experiment. The cue was then
presented, which consisted either of a circle (neutral) or of
an arrow pointing to the left or to the right and indicating
the target onset location in 50% of the trials. After 500 ms
since the appearing of the boxes the cue was presented,
together with the 4-dots masks. Two conditions were
equally likely: high visibility when the cue duration was 100
ms; low visibility when the cue duration was only 10 ms.
Successively the cue disappeared and only the 4-dots
remained on the screen for 50 ms in the high visibility
condition or 140 ms in the low visibility condition. In
sequence, the 4-dots disappeared and reappeared dislocated
by 0,2° externally, on the diagonals of the square where they
were place. After another 150 ms they disappeared and
reappeared dislocated again by 0,2°. The aim of this
sequence, 450 ms long, was to give the illusion of apparent
motion for reducing the cue visibility. Two SOA (Stimulus
Onset Asynchrony) were used: 150 ms and 850 ms, after
which the target appeared for 150 ms. Of course, the target
appeared during the mask sequence in the 150 ms SOA
condition but 400 ms after the end of the mask sequence in
the 850 ms SOA condition; 1500 ms after the target
disappeared, if no response was collected, then the next trial
began.

perceiving the cue when the duration was 10 ms were
excluded from the analysis. Participants completed 80
practice trials, 4 minutes duration, and 2 experimental
blocks, 400 trials (around 15 minutes) each. There were 112
valid, 112 invalid, 112 and neutral trials; there were also 10
trials without the cue and 30 trials in which the target was
not presented (catch trials).The interval between block
depended on subjects' needs.

Results
Central cues. The t-test on accuracy showed an effect of
Visibility (t1,15=8,8; p<.0001) with a higher percentage of
“yes” answers in the high visibility (mean= 98.2%; DS=
±2.8) than the low visibility (mean= 28.3%; DS=±32.1)
condition. The t-test also showed that the number of “yes”
answers in the low visibility condition was significantly
different from zero (t1,15=3.5; p<.002).
The ANOVA on reaction times (RT; Table 1) showed an
effect of Visibility (F1,14=22.2; p<.004), with faster RT in
high visible trials (mean= 399 ms) than in the low visible
trials (mean= 483 ms). The interaction Visibility by SOA
(F1,14=5.56; p<.003) and the interaction Visibility by Cue by
SOA (F1,14=15.44; p<.001) were also significant; the post
hoc analysis of the means showed differences between valid
and invalid trials at brief SOA, with both low (p<.03) and
high (p<.001) visibility; a significant difference at longer
SOA with low visibility (p<.001) and a tendency with high
visibility (p=.06). The Visibility by Cue interaction was not
significant (F=2,34; p=.15).

Participants did not receive any instruction regarding the
cue. At the end of each trial the participant was required to

see the grey stimulus?”), by pressing one of two buttons,
“SI” (“YES”) or “NO”, located on the keyboard in front of
him. Trials in which the subject reported consciously

Peripheral cues. The t-test on accuracy showed a difference
for Visibility (t1,15=23.8; p<.0001), with a higher percentage
of answers “yes” in the high visibility (mean= 98.4%; DS=

condition. The t-test also showed that the number of “yes”
answers in the low visibility condition was significantly
different from zero (t1,15=3.1; p<.005). The ANOVA
Visibility by Cue by Target Location showed a significant
effect of Visibility (F1,15=24.9; p<0001) with faster RT in the
high visibility condition (mean= 393 ms) and slower in the
low visibility condition (mean= 471 ms). The effect of
Target Location was also significant (F1,15=32.2; p<00001),
with slower RT for cue and target presented in the same
location (mean= 443 ms) than when they were presented in
two different locations (mean= 422 ms). The interaction
Visibility by Target Location (F1,15=43.35; p<00001) was
also significant. The post hoc analysis of the means revealed
slower RT for targets presented in the same location as the

3071

cue (mean= 417 ms) than in a different location (mean= 370
ms), but only when the cue was highly visible (p<.0002).

Discussion
The masking procedure used in the experiment was
effective in decreasing the cue visibility. When the cue was
presented for very short time (10 ms), participants reported
its presence in 30% of the trials when it appeared in the
central location, and in only 12% of the trials when it
appeared in the peripheral locations, similar to previous
results (e.g. Enns and Di Lollo, 1997) showing an increase
of the masking effect at bigger eccentricities. At 100 ms
durations, however, participants reported its presence on
98% of the trials.
When the cues appeared in the central location, although
they were not informative of the target onset location and no
instruction was given on the cue, participants showed a
facilitation effect for the cued location, suggesting that they
were following the information driven by the cue even
though the cue was not consciously perceived. Indeed, faster
RTs for the cued location were observed in both the high
and the low visibility conditions. This result seems to
confirm the hypothesis that the arrows cause an automatic
shift of attention; in fact, the observers did not have any
reason for trusting the cue’s indication because it was not
informative. On one hand, this result seems to replicate the
Tipples (2002) study, in which a centrally presented arrow
was able to induce an automatic shift of attention; on the
other hand it also confirms the results of studies showing
that not consciously perceived cues are able to induce an
automatic shift of attention (McCormick, 1997; Ivanoff and
Klein, 2003). Also, the typical biphasic pattern of reflexive
orienting (obtained usually with non informative peripheral
cues) was observed, with a facilitation at the 150 ms SOA
and a tendency toward inhibition (p<.06 but 30 ms
magnitude) at the 850 ms SOA, which seems to indicate the
presence of inhibition of return (IOR), but only after
consciously perceived cues. With non-consciously
perceived cues, facilitation was observed at both 150 ms and
850 ms SOAs. This result is relevant considering that,
although centrally presented symbolic cues – like eyegaze
for example – seem to elicit an automatic orienting of

attention (Friesen and Kingston, 1998), IOR is not typically
observed using either eye gaze (e.g. McKee, Christie and
Klein, 2007), or using arrows (Hommel, Pratt, Colzato and
Godijn, 2001).
On the other hand, Frischen and Tipper (2004) in a series
of experiments show that it is possible to observe IOR with
centrally presented non informative cues, at 2880 ms SOA
but not at 1200 ms. These results seem to show that IOR in
endogenous cueing could have a delayed onset; though it is
possible that differences in observing the IOR effect could
be due to methodological differences, because it is well
known that IOR strictly depends on both the task and the
attentional setting (Gibson and Amelio, 2000).
When cues appeared in peripheral locations the abrupt
onset effect seems to prevail on the symbolic meaning of the
cue. The IOR was observed only in the high visibility
condition and never in the low visibility, consistent with the
study by Ivanoff and Klein (2003), which showed IOR only
when observers were not required to report the cue. The
authors suggested that the IOR was observed because of this
methodological difference, suggesting that asking
participants to report the presence of the cue would
encourage the engaging of attention (Posner and Cohen,
1984) in the cued location, impeding the disengagement and
re-engagement to the new location (the mechanism that is
supposed to be involved in IOR), because observers were
not aware of the engagement itself.
However, it is possible the Ivanoff and Klein’s (2003)
results were due to a partial visibility of the cue, since not
asking any report could potentially have caused the
experimenters to include in the analysis the trials in which
the cues were seen. According to McCormick (1997), our
results suggest that IOR is not observed without awareness.

Experiment 2
The results of Experiment 1 showed that when observers
subjectively reported not to see the cue it is still possible to
observe that cue effect. However, some authors (e.g.
Eriksen, 1960; Kunimoto, Miller and Pashler, 2001) express
concern with subjective report measures.
The subjective report was used often in the first study of
unconscious perception. Sidis (1898), for example, asked
participants to identify alphanumeric characters. Observers
were able to identify a symbol despite the fact that it was
presented from such a great distance, that they only reported
to see a meaningless stain at the stimulus location.
This response bias could lead observers to make a
systematic mistake, denying the visibility of a stimulus that
could have been partially seen (Eriksen, 1960).
Accordingly, our result in the Experiment 1 could be due to
a partial visibility of the cue. Participants were asked, in
fact, to report the stimulus visibility as they subjectively
perceived it. In other words, the observer could have
adopted a conservative strategy, denying the visibility in
case of uncertainty, allowing the residual perception to
affect the results.

3072

Cheesman and Merikle (1984), in the attempt to avoid
response bias, used the subjects' ability to discriminate the
presence / absence of the stimulus to determine the
threshold of awareness. Based on this technique, they
concluded that unconscious perception does not exist.
Nonetheless, that definition of awareness is totally
insensitive to the phenomenal aspect of consciousness (e.g.
Cheesman and Merikle, 1986). Thus, it is not surprisingly
that many failed show the effect of unconsciously perceived
stimuli (Kunimoto, Miller and Pashler, 2001). Cheesman
and Merikle (1986) argued that the definitions of awareness
based on the objective report are not sensitive to
phenomenal experience, which is measurable only
subjectively, and suggested to distinguish between
conscious and unconscious perception by qualitative
differences, which would show different processing
modalities. The authors (Cheesman and Merikle, 1986)
showed that the Stroop effect increased as a function of the
number of congruent trials, consistent with the results of
studies on this effect in conscious conditions (e.g. Glaser
and Glaser, 1982), but only with above threshold stimuli.
This result seems to suggest that observers, not conscious of
the contingency relation between stimuli, could not
voluntarily adopt a strategy for predicting the prime
information. Accordingly, Lambert et al. (1999) showed that
observers did not show any cueing effect with peripheral
cueing task, when the performance on the presence of the
cue was at chance. Contrarily, observers showing a
performance a little better than chance showed a typical
automatic effect, while only subjects showing high visibility
showed an additional effect due to the contingency
relationship between cue and target.
In order to better understand the previous experiment's
results, it seems relevant to evaluate how they were
influenced by the residual visibility. Using an objective
report (2-alternatives forced choice) could resolve that
ambiguity and evaluate better how awareness affects the
orienting of attention.
The aim of the study is to replicate and extend the results
of the previous experiment and to evaluate the effective
residual perception on the cue visibility with an objective
report. In order to evaluate the effect of endogenous cues as
a function of visibility we ran an informative cueing task, in
both high and low visibility conditions asking subjects to
report the direction of the arrow. We expect to replicate
Casagrande et al. (2006) study, except for the IOR, which
should not arise using predictive cues.

Method
Participants Eighteen right handed students with normal or
corrected-to-normal vision (age= 23.7; DS ±2.24)
participated in the experiment after signing a consent form.
Stimuli and procedure. The stimuli were the same as the
previous experiment. The procedure was the same except
for two differences. The cues were predictive (p=.80) of the
target onset location and the observers were required, after

each trial, to indicate whether the grey stimulus was a circle
or an arrow pointing to the left or to the right, by pressing
the respective button on the keyboard in front of them.

Results
Central cues. The ANOVA showed an effect of Visibility
(F1,13=186.8; p<.0001) with a higher percentage of correct
answers in the high visibility (97%) than in the low
visibility condition (56.3%). The t-test indicates also that
the accuracy in the low visibility condition was significantly
better than chance (t=6.34; p<.0001).
The ANOVA on RT (Table 2) showed an effect of Cue
(F1,15=11,6; p<.003) with faster RT in the valid (mean= 391
ms) with respect to the invalid (mean= 408 ms) condition.
The ANOVA showed also the effect of Visibility
(F1,15=9.84; p<.01), with faster RT in the high visibility
condition (mean= 386 ms) and slower RT in the low
visibility condition (mean= 413 ms), as well as the effect of
SOA (F1,15=48,5; p<.0001), with slower RT at the shorter
SOA (mean= 468 ms) with respect to the longer SOA
(mean= 328 ms).

Peripheral cues. The ANOVA Target Location by
Visibility by Block by SOA showed an effect of Target
Location (F1,15=13,7; p<.002); RT were slower when target
appeared in the same position as the cue (mean= 423 ms)
and faster when it appeared in the opposite location (mean=
382 ms). Were also significant the effect of Visibility
(F1,15=14,46; p<.0002), of Block (F1,15=7,92; p<.01) and of
SOA (F1,15=52,9; p<.000003). The Target Location by
Visibility by Block by SOA was also significant (F1,15=9.19;
p<.01; Figure 3).

Discussion
The masking procedure used in the experiment turned out to
be effective in decreasing the cue visibility, even evaluated
with an objective report. When the cue was presented for
very short time (10 ms), participants correctly identified the
cue in the 53% of the trials while at 100 ms duration
participants correctly identified the cue in the 98% of the
trials. When cues were presented in the central location, the
results on RT confirm the ones obtained in previous
experiments (Casagrande et al., 2006) using a subjective
report for evaluating the cue visibility. We observed a
facilitation effect for targets presented at the cued location
in both the high and the low visibility conditions. Contrary
to the experiment 1, the IOR was not observed with
centrally presented cues. This result seems to confirm that

3073

the predictability of the cue could encourage the
engagement of the attention and impede the disengagement
and the following engagement to another location (Müller
and Findlay, 1988; see Berlucchi, Chelazzi & Tassinari,
2000 for a different result). The same effect has been found
in both the high and the low visibility conditions.

Figure 3: Mean RT for both high and low visibility
conditions when the target was presented at the same
location as the cue or at a different location, in both blocks
at each SOA.
When cues were presented in the peripheral locations a
difference arose between the first and second part of the
experiment (block 1 and 2). Results showed an IOR effect
when the cue was highly visible, in both the first and the
second block; when the cues were less visible there was no
effect on the first block, but there was in the second block.
The typical biphasic pattern of peripheral orienting (Posner
& Cohen, 1984) was observed, with facilitation at short
SOA and inhibition at long SOA.
This result has two implications: the first concerns the
automaticity of unconscious processes; the high training
received on the second part of the experiment seems to have
allowed the partial automation of the orienting effect
(Warner, Juola & Koshino, 1990), allowing it to arise in the
unconscious condition too. The second concerns the
possibility to observe the IOR effect in the unconscious
condition. The results in this experiment contrast with the
ones obtained by McCormick (1997) and Ivanoff and Klein
(2003). The differences between this experiment and the
ones reported by McCormick (1997) and Ivanoff and Klein
(2003) could depend on different procedures used in order
to reduce the visibility of the cue. In fact, either reducing the
contrast between stimulus and background (McCormick,
1997) or masking by metacontrast (Ivanoff & Klein, 2003)
might not have allowed the expression of the voluntary
component involved in the IOR, because of an earlier
interruption of the stimulus processing with respect to the 4dots masking (Enns and Di Lollo, 1997).

General Discussion
Taken together, these results seem to confirm that it is
possible to orient attention without consciously perceiving

the cue. Visual awareness, though, does not seem necessary
for spatial orienting to occur. Tipples (2002) suggested that
the arrow, as well as other symbolic spatial cues with high
social salience (e.g. Friesen & Kingstone, 1998), could
trigger an automatic, instead of voluntary, orienting of
attention as suggested by many (e.g., Posner, 1980).
It is relevant that the IOR was observed with centrally
resented cues. The biphasic pattern (early facilitation and
later inhibition), usually observed in peripheral
uninformative cueing tasks and not easily found in
endogenous cueing tasks (e.g. McKee, Christie & Klein,
2007), was observed, but only in the aware condition.
There are two possible explanations for the absence of the
IOR in the unconscious condition. First, it could be
impossible to observe IOR with not consciously perceived
cues. According to the original hypothesis on IOR (Posner
and Cohen, 1984) the disengagement (and following reengagement) of attention might be impossible without being
aware of the first engaging location.
Contrarily to the Experiment 1, in Experiment 2 no IOR
was observed for centrally presented cues. In this case,
however, the cue was predictive of the target onset location.
On one hand this result seems to confirm the automatic
component of the endogenous orienting. On the other hand
it could be important in the understanding of the IOR. It is
possible that the lack of awareness of the cue would delay or
impede the motor preparation, and the following inhibition,
as well as discrimination, related to detection tasks (e.g.
Klein & Taylor, 1994).
An apparently contradictory result is that IOR has been
found for cues presented in peripheral locations even with
not consciously perceived cues.
However, a partial
visibility of the cue, not sufficient for correctly identifying it
but sufficient for the motor activation to occur, could be
responsible for IOR in that condition. Contrarily, for
centrally presented cues a correct identification would be
needed for the activation to occur according to Treisman
and Gelade (1980), who suggested that localization occurs
before identification of complex features. Brignani et al., (in
press), on the other hand, show convincingly that the neural
mechanism involved in the spatial orienting of attention
elicited by arrows and purely endogenous stimuli are
identical, denying that those stimuli are “special”. The
authors suggested that the effects attributed to the automatic
orienting, observed with central cues, could be due to the
overlearned associations.
None of these claims is nonetheless surprising; in fact, it
seems clear that both a) the information driven by a symbol
has to be endogenously processed in order to be interpreted
and yield a spatial orienting, and b) that a strong association
between arrows and spatial region exists. Why, then, does
an endogenous cue yield an orienting effect even though not
consciously perceived? An alternate explanation, which
does not contrast with models of visual attention (e.g.
Posner, 1980) is that the endogenous orienting could have
an automatic component. If this was the case, it would not
be surprising that not consciously perceived arrows could

3074

elicit an endogenous orienting of attention. On the other
hand, many studies showed endogenous effects driven by
not consciously perceived cues (e.g. Marcel, 1983). This
hypothesis would be in line with Posner and Snyder (1975),
who said that a necessary characteristic of an automatic
process is that it should be able to occur without awareness.

Conclusions
Awareness does not seem necessary for driving the
automatic component of visual endogenous attention, as is
the case for exogenous orienting (McCormick, 1997;
Ivanoff & Klein, 2003). This result is highly relevant
because it shows for the first time that unconsciously
perceived cues lead to an en endogenous orienting of
attention. It does not contrast, however, with the hypothesis
of the dissociation between endogenous and exogenous
orienting. It contrasts, however, with the conceptual
overlapping of automatic and voluntary control respectively.
We did not find a definitive answer to any of the explicative
hypotheses in this study, but we did provide a good working
hypothesis for future studies on the relationship between
attention and consciousness.
