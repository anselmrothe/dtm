Abstract
Bayesian logic provides a rational model of probability
judgments deviating from the standard extensional norm of
extensional probability. It formalizes the general idea of an
inductive pattern logic that may resolve paradoxes of
inclusion. Bayesian logic predicts that it should be possible to
generalize the phenomenon of frequency-based logical conjunction fallacies to a system of logical inclusion fallacies. In
Experiment 1 quantitative conditions for conjunction fallacies
and the role of negations are investigated. Experiment 2 provides a first test of the postulated more general system of logical inclusion fallacies. The results of both experiments
confirmed the proposed pattern logic and its formalization as
Bayesian logic. Other theories of the conjunction fallacy
cannot readily explain this class of frequency-based and
pattern-based inclusion fallacies. Whether there are simpler
heuristics that may perhaps explain these data as well should
be investigated in the future.
Keywords: Probability judgments; conjunction fallacy; logic;
predication; paradoxes of inclusion.

Predication: Paradoxes of Logic
and Probability Theory
Human predication about a type of entities (the subject class
X) often deals with a logical relation (here using the general
symbol: l) between two predicates (predicate A and
predicate B). Take the ubiquity of the predication of the
relation ‘A and B’, understood as logical conjunction (A l
B = A ∧ B): “Ravens are black and they can fly.”
“Professional basketball players are quick and tall.”
Formulated generally: “X are A and B”.
Traditionally, a necessary condition for a valid logical
predication is that the predicate is true, in the sense that all
observed empirical cases confirm the classes of a connective’s truth table that are true (Frege, Russell,
Whitehead, Wittgenstein, Popper). Using predicate logic,
one would treat a predication as involving an implicit universal quantifier, “all X are A and B”. (An alternative is to
assume an implicit existential quantifier, cf. Brentano’s
works.)
Such an interpretation of predication entails two problems: (1) The problem of exceptions: There are exceptions
to most general predications that are concerned with
contingent empirical matters (cf. the problem of monotonicity). Actually, there are for example white ravens
(whole species of white ravens and cases of albinism) and
there are ravens that cannot fly. (2) The problem of
inclusions: The predication “ravens are black and they can
fly” paradoxically entails that one may equally use the
predicate of the inclusive disjunction “ravens are black OR
they can fly or both” (∀x (B(x) ∧ F(x)) => (B(x) ∨ F(x))).
Although this is, of course, true according to (extensional)
logic, it is a psychologically uninformative conclusion,
given that we are interested in an overall characterization of

a situation. For any situation in which one would use an
AND-predicate, one could equally use an OR-predicate.
This problem may also lie at the heart of the paradoxes of
implication in the narrow sense (cf. Evans & Over, 2004).
From “ravens are black and they can fly” it follows that “If
ravens are black then they can fly” (B ∧ F) => (B → F).
There is a bunch of these paradoxes, discussed in the
literature, e.g.: ¬B => (B → F); F => (B → F); (¬B ∧ F) =>
(B → F); (¬B ∧ ¬F) => (B → F). Still, here we will not
directly concentrate on conditionals, because there may be
specific problems of conditionals, due to a subjunctive interpretation, an incomplete representation or a reference to
causal relations. However, we saw that analogous paradoxes
arise for other connectives as well. I generally call them
paradoxes of inclusion. Even if one takes a different view on
the paradoxes of implication, this does not resolve the
paradox that ∀x B(x) ∧ F(x) implies a justification for the
predication ∀R B(x) ∨ F(x). The subset relation between an
AND-set and an OR-set is generally undisputed. We here
investigate this more general subset relation without
investigating questions of implication directly.
An apparent solution to the first problem, the problem of
exceptions, is the use of high probabilities as a necessary
condition for prediction (apart from existential prediction).
The sentence “Ravens are black and they can fly” may be
interpreted as a claim that the probability P(B & F|R) is high
(cf. Adams, 1986). This would offer a rational basis for
predication, but would not resolve the paradox of inclusion.

Conjunction Fallacy Debate: Problems of
Extensional Probability Judgments
A related debate – but normally discussed separately – is
concerned with the assignment of probabilities of conjunctive events. Here subjects’ intuition seems to deviate from
the perhaps most simple norm of (extensional) probability
theory (Kolmogorov, 1933):
In the classical Linda task, first proposed by Tversky and
Kahneman (1982, 1983; cf. Kahneman & Frederick, 2002)
participants were presented with a story: “Linda is 31 years
old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in
philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with
issues of discrimination and social justice, and also
participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.” As dependent
variable subjects had to rank statements to their probability,
including: “Linda is a bank teller” (B) and “Linda is a bank
teller and she’s active in the feminist movement” (B and F).
Most participants estimate P(B and F) > P(B). This is
known as conjunction fallacy (CF).
According to extensional probability theory, the conjunction ‘B ∧ F’ can never be more probable than one of its
components, ‘B’ or ‘F’ respectively, since any second property delimits the set size of the first one. Likewise also
non-standard accounts of probability, like the DempsterShafer belief functions, Cohen’s Baconian probabilities, or

248

fuzzy logic, which partly gave up the strict additivity of
probabilities, accept the conjunction rule: P(A ∧ B) ≤ P(A)
(cf. Kahneman & Frederick, 2002). Tversky and Kahneman
explained this phenomenon by the use of a “representativeness heuristic”. This heuristic consists of a first step of
evoking a prototype (a representative exemplar) to represent
categories (e.g. bank teller) and a second step of judging the
similarity of Linda with that prototypical exemplar (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002). Previously, the concept of representativeness has been criticized as being defined in a way
that is too vague to count as a proper explanation (Wolford,
1991; Gigerenzer, 1996, cf. 2000). However, the mentioned
refinement will not rule out this criticism completely.
A multitude of other qualitative and quantitative
approaches have been inspired by this phenomenon (cf. v.
Sydow, 2008, subm. a). Researchers argued qualitatively
that the fallacy could be prevented if one used clear logical
terms (e.g., Hilton, 1995; Mellers, Hertwig, & Kahneman,
2001; cf. Sides, Osherson, Bonini, & Viale, 2002; Bonini,
Tentori, & Osherson, 2004), a frequency format (Fiedler,
1988; Gigerenzer, 1996, 2000; Hertwig & Gigerenzer,
1999), less complex tasks (Lagnado & Shanks, 2002), a
ratings instead of rankings (Hertwig & Chase, 1998;
Hertwig & Gigerenzer, 1999; Sloman et al., 2003; Wedell &
Moro, 2008), or clear set inclusions (Sloman, Over, Slovak,
& Stibel, 2003; cf. Johnson-Laird, Legrenzi, Girotto,&
Legrenzi, 1999). Although these factors have shown to be
important extensional cues, the pattern logic advocated here
predicts that they are not sufficient to elicit extensional
answers (v. Sydow, 2007, 2008). Actually, conjunction
fallacies continued to occur even if one introduced many or
all of these factors simultaneously (Lagnardo & Shanks,
2002; Tentori et al., 2004; Sides et al., 2002; Bonini et al.,
2004; v. Sydow, 2007, 2008).
Moreover, there are a number of interesting quantitative
accounts of CFs that may in principle provide predictions
also for the frequency-based CFs investigated here. It has
for instance been argued that the conditional probability of
an AND-relation given the data, P(A & B| D), is misunderstood as inverse probability (cf. Wolford, 1991; Fisk,
1996; Hertwig & Chase, 1998), or as an increase in probability (support theory; Lagnado & Shanks, 2002; Sides et
al., 2002; cf. Crupi, Fitelson, & Tentori, 2008) or as some
other measure (Busemeyer & Wang, 2007; Costello, 2005).
Although these models were able to explain some data, the
empirical situation has remained unclear and none of these
models would have predicted the frequency-based CFs
confirming Bayesian Logic (v. Sydow, 2007, 2008).

Bayesian Pattern Logic
General Idea Bayesian Logic (v. Sydow, 2007, 2008,
subm. a, subm. b), formalizes the idea of pattern-based,
logical probability judgments, providing a rational basis for
a class of conjunction fallacies and related logical fallacies.
This account builds on the idea that probability is a polysemous notion (Hertwig & Gigerenzer, 1998; cf. Fiedler,
1988; Wolford, 1991; Fisk, 1996; Sides et al., 2002).
However, from my point of view this does not need to imply
normative agnosticism (Kahneman & Tversky, 1996). Extensional probabilities, e.g. PE(A ∧ B|D), are defined by (the

limit of) the number of confirmatory cases (the extension)
relative to all observed cases in the given universe of
discourse X. The analogous pattern probability
(PP(A ∧ B|D)), specified by Bayesian logic, is the probability that, given some data, the underlying generative
structure as a whole is e.g. an AND probability pattern.
There are two main reasons for introducing pattern probabilities. First, pattern probabilities could provide a rational
probabilistic basis for logical predication that can account
for exceptions and that may resolve the paradoxes of inclusion. Bayesian logic allows using a high probability criterion as necessary condition for predication, but does not fall
pray to the paradoxes of inclusion. “Ravens are black and
they can fly” is probable, “Ravens are black or they can fly
or both or none” may nonetheless be improbable (as
pattern). Second, the goal of probability judgments is often
to characterise an overall situation in one single sentence.
Imagine a hunter, who has knowledge about a few exemplars of a species of wisent and the relation of two properties (say thick fur, A, and good meat, B). Think of two
worlds (Table 1).

In which of these worlds would the hunter tell his friend
that probably wisent have thick fur and at the same time
provide good meat? The extensional probability PE(A ∧ B)
is, of course, identical in both worlds. The pattern probability favours a dominant AND-pattern in world 1 and an Apattern in world 2 (v. Sydow, subm. a). If we really have the
goal to use probability judgments to evaluate overall
situations, extensional probabilities are inefficient. An
AND-proposition would only be concerned with one cell
relative to all other cells, without characterising the overall
pattern. You would need several extensional probability
judgments to characterise a situation. If people have the goal
to characterise a situation in one sentence, a rational
analysis (cf. Anderson, 1990) would predict that people
should intuitively reason in a pattern way, deviating from
extensional probability judgments.
Sketch of the Model Bayesian (Pattern) Logic (or BL, for
short) is intended to be a rational and, for the time being, an
empirical model of pattern probabilities (for more details cf.
v. Sydow, 2007, 2008, subm. a, b). However, the model is
formulated on the so-called computational, not on the
algorithmic level (sensu Marr). It is assumed that people are
intuitive experts of pattern recognition and approximate the
predictions of BL, whatever underlying process gives rise to
this performance.
BL aims to contribute to the renaissance of Bayesian
models in the cognitive sciences (cf. Oaksford & Chater,
2007; Tenenbaum, Griffith & Kemp, 2006). BL provides
probabilities about hypotheses concerned with logical
relations and whole situations (previous Bayesian accounts of
the CF were not, cf. Fisk, 1996). BL itself is formulated in
terms of extensional probability theory, but on the emergent
level, it does not subscribe to extensionality and the

249

conjunction rule. BL calculates pattern-sensitive posterior
probabilities of logical hypotheses, given some data pattern D
in a 2×2 contingency matrix: PP(A l B | D).
The ‘logical’ hypotheses are formalized as probabilistic
probability tables, consisting of four probabilities. The
changing posteriors are actually second order probabilities
each concerned with a whole probability table.
(1) Probability tables (PTs) are built corresponding to the
16 truth tables of propositional logic. The construction of the
PTs relies on two assumptions.
Assumption of idealization. To get from truth tables to
PTs an assumption about the distribution of the probabilities
of the true cases has to be made. Formal logic only assumes
that evidences correspond to true cases. According to the assumption of idealization the cell probabilities of true cases,
PPT(T), in a PT are assumed to be equally probable (cf.
Johnson-Laird et al., 1999). This formalizes the idea of an
ideal logical explanation. In case of deterministic logical
relationships (no noise, r = 0), the cell probability of a true
cell in an ideal logical PT is one divided by the number of
true cells: PPT(T | r = 0) = 1 / N(Tl) = tl, resulting for instance
in tA∧B = 1, tA = 50, and tA∨B = .33.
For deterministic relations the
R = 0 R = .3 R = .6
probability of a false cell is zero: A ∧ B
PPT(F | r = 0) = 0.
Secondly, the assumption of
uncertainty formalizes the idea of
A
probabilistic logical relations.
Here a general level of uncertainty for a PT is assumed (cf.
B
Oaksford & Chater, 2007), given
that no specific sources of noise
are known (v. Sydow, 2007, A><B
2008). Whereas a single disconfirmatory event should be able to
falsify a deterministic relation- A ∨ B
ship, this event should not refute
a probabilistic relationship. A Figure 1: Illustration of
the general idea of
single PT formalizes an explanadifferent
PTs and noisetory connective at a particular
levels r. Darker vs.
noise level. The assumed noise
level r of a PT is taken to be the brighter cells represent
ratio of the cell probability of a high vs. low probability.
true cell relative the probability of a false cell.1 The same
formalization results if noise is taken to be an external cause
that influences each cell independently (noisy-or). Based on
this assumptions, it can be shown that for ideal noisy PTs
the probability of a true cell is P(T) = 1 / (t + 4r –tr) and that
of a false cell is P(F) = r / (t + 4r –tr).
For r = 0.1 the PT for A ∧ B is (.76, .08, .08, .08), the PT
for A∨B is (.32; .32; .32; .04). Each PT represents a possible
connective-noise combination: A l,r B. Note, that here P(r)
is not treated as free parameter. We start with a flat
uninformative prior probability distribution both for the
noise levels and the connectives.
1
Previously r was the proportion of probabilities that were distributed equally over all cells of a PT (cf. v. Sydow, 2007, 2008).
Both possible variants here lead to the same predictions.

(2) Further model steps. Now it is possible to generate the
likelihood for the generative connective-noise hypotheses, A
l,r B. The multinomial distribution provides the discrete
probability distribution of obtaining a data pattern D of the
disjoint outcomes D = (xa, xb, xc, xd), in a sample of N trials,
given a PT (a connective-noise hypothesis) with the
respective probabilities pa, pb, pc, pd (with 0 ≤ pm ≤ 1).

Subsequently, Bayes’ theorem is used to calculate the
posterior probabilities given the data, D:

PH ( A o l,r B | D ) =

In order to calculate the probability of a logical
hypothesis (Hl = A l B), we sum up the posterior
probabilities over all error levels rj:
PH ( A o l B | D ) =

∑

PH ( A o l, r B | D )

(4)

j

The resulting value is a pattern probability, with the same
form as the requested conditional probability P(A ol B|D).
Since subjects may be not interested in differences, but in
ratios of these probabilities one may use the mean of the log
odds of all comparisons between hypotheses (cf. Study 1).
(3) Predictions and previous corroborations. BL makes a
number of novel predictions. BL should be applicable if one
is concerned with alternative logical hypotheses and whole
situations (rather than subsets). Qualitatively, CFs should
hence occur, even if one uses extensional cues, as long these
preconditions of the model apply. In von Sydow (2008) this
was corroborated, using frequencies, clear set inclusions and
rating scales. Quantitatively, BL predicts sample size effects
(v. Sydow, 2007) and pattern sensitivity (v. Sydow, 2008).
The following two experiments test some further
predictions. Experiment 1 is concerned with the role of
negations and quantitative conditions of double conjunction
fallacies. Experiment 2 is concerned with the generalization
to other connectives: logical inclusion fallacies in general.

Experiment 1: Quantitative Conditions of
Double Conjunction Fallacies and Negations
Goals Experiment 1 had three goals: First, the quantitative
conditions of double CFs will be investigated. Second, the
experiment was intended to check whether the predictions
hold independently of whether we use negated evidence and
negated hypotheses. Third, the experiment excluded possible
misunderstandings of the conjunction and the affirmation by
using all four kinds of possible conjunctions.
Double CFs are committed if participants probability
judgments involve Pemp(A) < Pemp(A ∧ B) and Pemp(A ∧ B) >
Pemp(B) (cf. Carlson & Yates, 1989). Bayesian logic formalizes the proposed pattern logic and provides more precise
predictions when these double CFs are rationally predicted. In
this experiment all four types of data patterns had a modal

(conjunctive) frequency in the same logical cell (cf. Fig. 2A
first line). However, dominant double CFs are only predicted
for two of these patterns (Pattern type 1 and 2; cf. Fig. 1B).
Pattern type 1 investigated whether dominant double CFs
occur at least with highly probable conjunctive cell (Pattern
Type 1 with PE(B ∧ F) = .8). Pattern type 2 explores whether
participants commit double CFs even if its probability is
below 50 % (PE(B ∧ F) = .4). BL predicts dominant double
CFs with reduced confidence, cf. Fig. 1B). This would pose a
problem for an account that is only concerned with very high
probabilities (cf. Adams, 1986). For the other two patterns,
double CFs should not be dominant, although the extensional
probability of the conjunction is now higher (Pattern Type 3
with PE(B ∧ F) > .5) or gets closer to an AND-pattern
(Pattern Type 4). The few theories that explicitly predict
double CFs (Costello, 2005, cf. Carlson & Yates, 1989)
would have to predict them here as well. However, Bayesian
logic predicts more double CFs in Pattern 2 than in Pattern 3.
Method 64 participants from the University of Göttingen
participated in the study voluntarily. Participants received a
booklet with four judgment tasks, each presented on a single
page. The shown frequencies were derived from four pattern
types, using 4 rotations as balancing factors, resulting in 16
frequency patterns (Fig. 2A). The sample size was always
60. Participants received all four pattern types, but only one
rotation. Each pattern type and rotation occurred equally
often in all 16 presentation positions (cf. Fig. 2C).
Participants were instructed to be in a role of someone
who is generally interested in the overall evaluation of
different schools (e.g. the ‘Linda school’). They should tick
the hypothesis about the logical relation between two
properties of the graduates (they become bank teller, they
become feminist) that is “at least most probable”.
The frequency information was presented to the participants in a contingency table, whose cells and marginals
were labeled (e.g. ‘bank teller & feminist’, ‘bank teller’)
The used eight hypotheses read: “The graduates of the Linda
School generally became bank tellers and at the same time
feminists” (B & F) and analogous formulations for B &
Non-F; Non-B & F; Non-B & Non-F. The affirmations read
“[…] bank tellers” (B); “[…] no bank tellers” (non-B), with
analogous other formulations for F and non-F. Subjects
were asked to answer intuitively.
Results Figure 1D shows the percentage of the selection
of a particular logical hypothesis to be most probable in the
four pattern types. The results were conflated over the factors Rotation and Position. Beforehand, the data for the rotations were recoded (e.g., B & non-F selections in the 90°
rotations became B & F selections). In all pattern types the
dominant selections corresponded to the dominant prediction of BL. As expected, the results for the Pattern types,
where the confidence should be lower, were slightly less
pronounced. The second most frequent selections for all
pattern types corresponded to the second most probable pattern, as predicted by BL (cf. Fig. 2B). However, this may
correspond to a combination of other strategies (extensional
strategies in type 1 and 2, and a most probable cell strategy
in pattern 3 and 4).
If participants misunderstood conjunctions as disjunctions, they should have answered differently.

(C) 16 presentation orders for 4 positions: numbers =

The few other theories that explicitly predicted double
CFs would have predicted them in all four pattern types (cf.
Carlson & Yates, 1989; Costello, 2005). Other theories would
predict specific order effects.
A parsimonious way to test, whether only pattern type or
also other factors contributed to the data is to conduct a loglinear analysis, simply treating the data as independent
observations. On the level of single data points, Pattern type
and Rotation are fully crossed factors and Position can be
used as a third factor, not considering confounding predecessors (order). To increase the number of expected cases in
each cell we used the factors Pattern types (Types 1 & 2 vs.
Types 3 & 4) * Rotations * Positions (Position 1 & 2 vs. 3
& 4) * possible answers (B & F vs. B vs. Rest). If the answers are only determined by the factor postulated by BL, a
hierarchical model with only one interaction between Pattern type and answers shall fit the data. Our analysis yielded
that only the 2-way term for the interaction became significant (k = 2 with Pearson’s χ2= 31.26, df = 17, p = .01).
The default model fitting then eliminated all two-way term
interactions that did not significantly contribute to this
effect, resulting only in the predicted second order term,
which fitted the data without significant deviation (χ2 =
28.60, df = 42, p = .94). A further analysis was run, enlarging n per cell by distinguishing only two types of rotations,
again yielding the same best model with only the predicted
second order term (Pattern type * Answers) (χ2 = 12.12, df
= 18, p = .84). As predicted, participants’ selection of the
most probable hypothesis was primarily affected by Pattern
type, not by Rotation or by Position.
Discussion The results of Experiment 1 provide evidence
that double CFs occur systematically and under the quantitative conditions predicted by BL. The results corroborated
the existence of a kind of pattern logic of probability judg-

comparing Type 2 and Type 3). The used eight
hypotheses with the frequency variations excluded a misunderstanding of the ‘B AND F’
as ‘B OR F’, and of the ‘B’ as ‘B & non-F’. It
was shown that in the tasks without memory
component BL holds for negations as well as
for affirmations.

Moreover, in a context with given frequencies and without
memory load, we found no asymmetry in the treatment of
positive and negative hypotheses and evidences. In
Experiment 2 a generalization to other logical connectives
was tested, corroborating the predicted system of resulting
logical inclusion fallacies. The results additionally suggest
that pattern logic may be a default strategy (Exp. 2a vs. 2b).
The found system of pattern-based probability judgments
cannot be explained by any previous theory of the CF, like
inverse probability, support, signed summation, or rescaling.
Although BL has some similarities to representativeness, the
results cannot be explained by a ‘prototypic exemplar +
similarity’ explanation (cf. v. Sydow, 2007).
In conclusion, there seems to be a highly coherent class of
frequency-based inclusion-fallacies, which are consistent
with the rational predictions of Bayesian logic.
