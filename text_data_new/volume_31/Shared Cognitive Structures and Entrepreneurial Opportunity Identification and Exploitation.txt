Abstract
This paper analyzes collective cognitive structures in
entrepreneurial teams. Recently, there has been increased
interest in entrepreneurial cognition and teams. This study
contributes to explaining how entrepreneurial teams identify
and exploit opportunities. The focus is on shared cognition
and its evolution over a period of two years in the Germanspeaking software industry.
Keywords: collective cognitive structures, entrepreneurial
teams, opportunity identification and exploitation.

Introduction
In the pursuit of opportunity identification and
exploitation (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), entrepreneurs
develop cognitive structures. The cognitive structures
oftentimes span across the entire entrepreneurial team
(Ensley & Pearce, 2001; West, 2007). This research
analyzes the differences in team members' cognitive
structures and the shared cognition of the entrepreneurial
team. Moreover, this study concerns the evolution of
cognitive structures or, in other words, the learning of
entrepreneurial team members over time. Finally, the
relationship between the change in shared cognition in the
entrepreneurial teams and the identification and exploitation
of opportunities is examined. The research questions are:
(1) How do shared cognitive structures of entrepreneurial
teams evolve over time?
(2) How do these shared cognitive structures relate to
opportunity identification and exploitation?

Literature
Shared team cognition has been understood in
many different ways. In this paper, shared cognition is
conceptualized as overlapping causal maps (Laukkanen,
1994). More generally, shared mental models are “beliefs
that shape inferences, predictions, and decisions about what
actions to take” (Cannon-Bowers, Salas, & Converse,
1993).
In management, shared mental models were
discussed as “dominant logic” (Prahalad & Bettis, 1986)
and other frameworks of social cognition (e.g., Ginsberg,
1990). Levine, Resnick and Higgins (1993) pointed out that
“outside the laboratory and the school, cognition is almost
always collaborative” (p. 591). Walsh (1995) argues that
“When a group of individuals is brought together, each with

their own knowledge structure about a particular
information environment, some kind of emergent collective
knowledge structure is likely to exist.” (p. 291). There is
plenty of empirical evidence that entrepreneurial teams are
omnipresent (e.g., Kamm et al., 2000). Moreover, Gartner et
al. (1994) suggested that “entrepreneurship is more likely to
be plural”.
In order to better understand shared mental models
of entrepreneurial teams, this study draws on insights from
the group literature in management (e.g., Miller, Burke, &
Glick, 1998). Particularly, Fiol (1994) discusses the tensions
between unified thinking and multiple interpretations. In
addition, there is evidence of cognitive variance of the team
members (Ginsberg, 1990; Prahalad & Bettis, 1986). In the
field of entrepreneurship, West (2007) proposes a model
where Entrepreneurial Team Collective Cognition (ETCC)
is a mediator between the individual-level factors and the
decisions and actions of the new venture. West finds an
inverted U-shaped relationship between the new venture
performance and the degree of differentiation and
integration of strategic constructs within the top
management team of a venture. The current study builds on
the insights gained from a limited number of studies on
entrepreneurial teams (e.g., Ensley & Pearse, 2000; West,
2007) and from group research in management (e.g., Miller
et al., 1998).
Yet, the objective of this paper goes beyond
understanding shared mental models of entrepreneurial
teams. This paper focuses on the evolution of shared mental
models and their impact on opportunity identification. In
essence, this paper tries to understand collective cognitions
of entrepreneurial teams from a dynamic perspective. With
the prominent exception of Barr, Stimpert and Huff (1992)
very few studies analyze cognitive maps over time. Barr et
al. investigated the cognitive maps of two railroad
companies over time where only one had satisfactory
performance and survived. Although both railroad
companies recognized the decline in the rail industry, only
the surviving firm changes their mental model of how
organizational performance is affected by the changed
environment. While Barr et al. (1992)’s paper is extremely
important and highly relevant, by design it cannot analyze
the divergence among the different members of the
management team because it uses letters to shareholders as

2182

data source rather than individual interviews as does the
current study.

Methodology and Research Design
The research is designed as a comparative case
study (Yin, 1994; Eisenhardt, 1989/2007) of nine ventures
in the German-speaking software market. The Software
Industry within the Information Technology Industry is
interesting for several reasons: first, the burst of the internet
bubble (European Information Technology Observatory,
2004) and the economic downturn 2001/02 (OECD report,
2002/03) hit very hard as the evaluation in this sector in the
stock market and the projects done in this field were
incomparably well paid. This, of course, led to major
change and new opportunities in this industry. On the other
hand, many potential opportunities through merging with
other industries such as the telecommunication industry
arose. Second, the software industry reaches maturity over
the observation period: professionalization, standardization,
and industrialization become very relevant in this industry.
The above arguments together with the fact that this
industry is characterized by little regulation by authorities,
few standards and no patents makes it an interesting
industry to study entrepreneurial opportunities.
The ventures investigated here are located in
Munich (Germany) and Zurich/St. Gallen (Switzerland) and
are comparable along a number of dimensions such as
business, customers, size, structure and development of the
company. At three equidistant time points between 2004
and 2006 semi-structured interviews of each 90 minutes
were conducted with the three most influential individuals
in each one of the nine ventures resulting in 81 interviews.
The method for data analysis is cognitive mapping
technique (Eden, 1992; Eden & Spender, 1998; Fiol & Huff,
1992; Huff, 1990, Walsh, 1995). Precisely, causal mapping
technique (Eden & Ackermann, 1998) was used. The causal
maps are analyzed on the individual level and on the
collective level. For the collective level, the causal maps are
aggregated across participants with the focus on the
diversity of explanations that the team members provided
(Bougon, 1992; Cossette & Audet, 1992; Laukkanen, 1994).
As opposed to congregate maps, aggregate maps include
dominant causalities and concepts of individuals maps
(Bougon, 1992). This is essential for this study as it
preserves the diversity of concepts since concepts that are
dominant in individual maps are retained. In sum, the
cognitive maps will be analyzed on three levels: (1)
individual cognitive structures; (2) collective cognitive
structures; and (3) collective cognitive structures over time
(=collective learning about opportunities). This stepwise
analysis enables me to compare the collective or shared
cognitive structures over time and its impact on
entrepreneurial opportunity identification.

The dependent variable in this study is opportunity
identification and exploitation. In line with Shane and
Venkataraman (2000; 220) I define opportunities as
“situations in which new goods, services, raw materials,
markets and organizing methods can be introduced through
the formation of new means, ends, or means-ends
relationships”. Regarding opportunity exploitation, an index
was created from the actual opportunities that have been
implemented by the company on a scale of 1 through 10. It
is important that these measures are – as opposed to the
shared cognitive maps described above - not subjective.
These measures are objective and based on a multitude of
internal and external documents of each one of the ventures
(e.g, internal reports, marketing reports, websites, reports
about the company, sales figures, etc.) that were
triangulated. In this process of triangulation, only
information was tested for consistency across sources and
only used when consistent across at least two sources. In
order to be comprehensive, a given venture’s opportunity
exploitation was examined along five dimensions: product
innovation, service innovation, technology innovation,
marketing innovation, and organizational innovation. The
opportunity identification is constructed from additional
information and interviews with people within the
entrepreneurial team and outside of the entrepreneurial team
in order to get a sense of the number of opportunities
currently identified.
In the interviews, a set of questions was asked
relative to opportunities identified by each company. These
questions were asked in the same way in t1, t2, and t3. In
order to be inclusive, the questions in each one of these
interviews refer to a compilation of the different strategic
areas of any business: business model, learning and
challenges, strategy and core competencies, customer focus
and management, strategic alliances, perception of industry
and competition and vision. While the focus of these
interviews is intentionally broad, it is systematic in its
replication over time (i.e., the same set of questions is asked
at the three different points in time, interviews span 2 years
and are separated by eight months each). These maps are
aggregated into a map representing the overlap and diversity
of concepts and causalities. The aggregate maps were
subject to an analysis of centrality, domain and cluster.
These three measures together indicate the dominance of
certain concepts from different angles and therefore
guarantee validity. The coding process for two randomly
selected interviews was replicated by two independent
researchers that are active in other disciplines. The interrater reliability was 87%.

Data Analysis and Results
In the following, the insights from the analysis of
the individual and the shared cognitive maps over time are
presented.

Researchers have found that complex mental
model structure increases both individual and organizational
capacity to respond and perform successfully (Ginsberg,
1990). Ginsberg (1994) argues that groups with greater
cognitive complexity are more likely to define their
competitive environment comprehensively and creatively
than homogenous groups. The importance of cognitive
complexity on a variety of output variables having been
shown in on the individual level (e.g., Bartunek, Gordon, &
Weathersby, 1983) and on the organizational level (e.g.,
Goodwin & Ziegler, 1998), there is reason to believe that it
leads to convergent results in the context of entrepreneurial
opportunity identification and exploitation given uncertainty
and the ambiguity of the entrepreneurial situation and the
fact that processes and routines are usually not yet in place
in this young firms to cope with these challenges. Therefore,
the following is proposed:

The data analyzed in this study clearly showed the
above stated relationship. For instance, the company with
the highest overall average of cognitive complexity of the
shared cognitive maps over time, Epsilon-Tech showed a
clear vision to expand their current business to reach a very
large and different market. The company envisions a
strategy where they can replicate their business model with
exponential growth. Delta-Tech, by contrast, is the company
in the entire sample that neither identified nor exploited any
substantial business opportunities over the observation
period.
Related to this is the question to what degree are
the cognitive maps shared by the members of the
entrepreneurial team which I will discuss in the following
sections and which will result in propositions 2, 3a and b.
Given that cognitive maps consist of concepts and
causalities, four theoretical possibilities of overlap present
themselves in this context. The first set of possibilities is
that the concepts and causalities are shared or are not
shared. The second set of possibilities is that only concepts
or only causalities are shared.

2. Number of Shared Concepts and Causalities
Fiol (1994) investigated the new venture
development process and found that organizational learning
is really about the development of diverse interpretations.
Fiol shows how the team members in the ventures that she
analyzed developed unified ways of framing their
arguments, while at the same time maintaining diversity
through differences in the content of team members'
interpretations. Similarly, Clarysee & Moray (2004) relate
knowledge diversity to team learning, which, respectively is
likely to lead to a greater number of opportunities. For the
study of shared cognitive maps, this finding would translate
into a high number of shared elements of the maps and a
low number of shared elements of the maps. Given that the
constituent elements of cognitive maps are concepts and
causalities (i.e., links), the following is proposed:
Proposition 2: A ratio of shared concept to shared
causalities of greater than 2 results in the identification of a
great number of opportunities.

At Epsilon-Tech, for instance, at t1 adaptiveness
was the most dominant concept for all three interviewees.
Figure 3 illustrates the map across participants (=different
colors) for Epsilon-Tech at t1. The different dominant
decision makers recurred to different explanations how
adaptiveness serves the company and how it may be
reached. Yet, the different causal explanations all support
the general concept of adaptiveness to the environment. The
reasons provided by the team members are of different
nature such as “freedom of the partners”, “clarity of guiding
principles”, “performance of strategy process”, or
“compatibility of product roadmap”.

Proposition 3b: A high number of shared concepts and

opportunities but the exploitation of many opportunities
when overall complexity of cognitive maps is high.

Proposition 3a: A high number of shared concepts and
causalities results in the identification and exploitation of
few opportunities when overall complexity of cognitive
maps is low.

Theoretically, there are two more possibilities. The
first possibility is that near to no concepts and causalities are
shared. This was not the case for any of shared cognitive
maps analyzed here. The last alternative would be that only
the causalities are shared but not the concepts. Yet, this
theoretical possibility is precluded from empirical
occurrence since causalities without concept cannot exist in
this approach.

remaining cases in the sample show a similar pattern.
Therefore, a set of propositions is derived:

Figure 3: Map of Epsilon at t1.

By contrast, Beta-Tech (data available from the
author) shows the highest number of shared concepts and
causality in the sample. In other words, the maps of BetaTech are strikingly coherent and integrated; nearly every
element in the maps is connected with every other element
in the map. Beta-Tech identifies quite a number of
opportunities such as developing a new product on a
different technological platform and a completely new
business model and organizational structure as well as
strategic partners. Beta-Tech did have some interesting
ideas, yet all the members of the team were so familiar with
the company that they found a lot of reasons why the
opportunities should not be exploited at this specific point in
time. In this sense, the shared cognition inhibited the
exploitation of opportunities. This raises another interesting
issue, i.e. that shared cognition has a differential effect on
opportunity identification and exploitation.

Only few studies in the field of management
investigate the change of cognitive maps over time. Barr et
al. (1992) did not look at the overall integration of the map
in terms of centrality, domain and cluster. The analysis of
integration of cognitive concepts and causalities of this
study and the comparison with the opportunity identification
and exploitation gave a different pattern. Based on the
identification of continuity vs. discontinuity of concepts
from tn to tn+1, I explored the following set of propositions:
Proposition 4a: The continuity of concepts in shared
cognitive map (concepts and causalities) is associated with
the identification (and hence exploitation) of fewer
opportunities.
Proposition 4b: The discontinuity of concepts in shared
cognitive map (concepts and causalities) is associated with
the identification and exploitation of more opportunities.
The development of the shared cognitive maps of
Alpha-Tech and Epsilon-Tech are illustrated in Figures 4
and 5 respectively.

3. Shared concepts and cognitive complexity
Just like Beta-Tech above, Delta-Tech is a
company that had also a substantial overlap of concepts and
causalities. Yet, it identified only very few opportunities and
these opportunities were highly related to their current
business and their strategic moves were rather reactive. The

Figure 5: Evolution of dominant concepts at Epsilon-Tech
At each time point the concepts that were the most
prominent in the collective maps are illustrated. While
evolution of the shared cognitive maps at Alpha-Tech is
characterized by the highest continuity, the cognitive map at
Epsilon-Tech is associated with discontinuity. The
continuity of all central concepts at Alpha-Tech is
evidenced by the continued line in the above graph. This
continuity of the concepts is striking when compared to the
remaining firms in the sample. Alpha-Tech’s cognitive
maps show extremely consistent argumentation over time.
The most dominant concepts at Epsilon-Tech
clearly change (indicated by the single data points in Figure
5). At t2 the most relevant shared concept at Epsilon-Tech is
a financial goal, i.e. “100 million dollar growth in three
years” and at t3 the most dominant shared concept is
“profit” with acquisitions and more precisely an acquisition
capability being the main driver for profits. Yet, the pattern
in the shared cognitive maps supporting the changing most
dominant constructs remains, i.e. high number of shared
constructs with high diversity in causalities.

Figure 6 illustrates that the total overlap between
concepts and causalities is negatively related to opportunity
identification and exploitation. The partial overlap of
concepts only but not causalities, by contrast, is positively
related to opportunity identification and exploitation.
Discontinuity of concepts contained in the shared cognitive
map over time is also positively related to opportunity
identification and exploitation. Furthermore, overall
cognitive complexity of the collective map was identified as
a moderator in this relationship by this study.
There may be trade-offs between these variables that have
not yet been fully explored in this study. It would be
interesting to understand, for instance, whether a
discontinuity of concepts (that could be generated through
external consultants and/or industry outsiders) could
mitigate the negative effect of limited cognitive complexity
or exceeding overlap at a map at one point in time.
Conceivably, an intervention in some companies that share
too much of their knowledge in order to generate creative
“follow-up opportunities” could be valid basis for
generating new ideas, yet the complexity of the maps need
to be increased through outsider input resulting in a
discontinuity. In sum, the model invites researchers to a
rigorous large sample test of the variables in this model and
(entrepreneurial) teams to reflect on their current practices
and mental models and how they fit this model.
While being limited to one cultural context and a
selection of ventures, this project provides insights into the
development of shared collective cognition and its impact
on business outcomes.
