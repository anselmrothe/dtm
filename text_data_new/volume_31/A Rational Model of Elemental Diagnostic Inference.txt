sulting from a rational inference strategy that is well adapted
to the goal of acquiring and using causal knowledge.

Abstract
Whereas the traditional normative benchmark for diagnostic
reasoning from effects to causes is provided by purely statistical norms, we here approach the task from the perspective of
rational causal inference. The core feature of the presented
model is the assumption that diagnostic inferences are constrained by hypotheses about the causal texture of the domain.
As a consequence, the model’s predictions systematically deviate from classical, purely statistical norms of diagnostic inference. In particular, the analysis reveals that diagnostic
judgments should not only be influenced by the probability of
the cause given the effect, but also be systematically affected
by the predictive relation between cause and effect. This prediction is tested in three studies. The obtained pattern of diagnostic reasoning is at variance with the traditional statistical
norm but consistent with a model of rational causal inference.

“(aïve Bayes” as a (orm of Diagnostic Inference
Let C denote a binary cause and E a binary effect, and let c+,
c− and e+, e− indicate the presence and absence, respectively,
of these events. Making a diagnostic judgment from effect
to cause can then be expressed as estimating the conditional
probability of the cause given the effect, P(c+|e+). Given a
joint frequency distribution over C and E the empirical
conditional probability P(c+|e+) can be directly estimated
from the frequency of co-occurrences (·). Alternatively,
one can use Bayes’ rule to derive this probability from the
conditional probability of the effect given the cause,
P(e+|c+), the base rate of the target cause, P(c+), and the
marginal probability of the effect, P(e+):

Introduction
In this paper we present a rational analysis of diagnostic
reasoning – the process of reasoning from effects to causes.
Diagnostic inferences are not only ubiquitous in medicine,
but also in everyday reasoning. For example, we reason
from effects to causes when we try to explain why our car
does not start or when we try to identify the causes of why
our computer crashed once again. Whereas the traditional
normative yardstick for such inferences is provided by purely statistical norms, we use the framework of causal-model
theory (e.g., Pearl, 2000; Waldmann & Holoyak, 1992;
Waldmann, Hagmayer, & Blaisdell, 2006) and causal Bayesian inference (Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005; Lu, Yuille,
Liljeholm, Cheng, & Holyoak, 2008) to elucidate the relevant kinds of inputs, computations, and outputs involved in
diagnostic reasoning.
We here focus on the most basic type of diagnostic inference, which involves a single cause-effect relation between
two binary events. Based on a rational analysis of such
diagnostic inferences we have developed a computational
model that details the influence of competing hypotheses
about causal structure and causal strength. Whereas it is
usually assumed that diagnostic judgments should merely be
a function of the empirical conditional probability
P(Cause | Effect), our analysis reveals that diagnostic inferences should also be systematically affected by the predictive probability P(Effect | Cause) and by the causal power
(Cheng, 1997) of the target cause. We tested the model’s
predictions in three studies. While the observed pattern of
reasoning appears irrational from a purely statistical perspective, our analyses suggest that it may be viewed as re-

We refer to this approach as naїve Bayes because under this
view the application of Bayes’ rule is nothing but an elementary result of standard probability theory. In particular,
no reference is made to the generative causal processes
underlying the observed events, and no uncertainty about
parameter estimates is assumed in these computations.
This use of Bayes’ rule provides the classical statistical
norm to which peoples’ diagnostic judgments usually have
been compared (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1973). Several
studies have shown that peoples’ judgments often substantially deviate from this norm and have attempted to pinpoint
factors which lead people to conform to this norm (e.g.,
Gigerenzer & Hoffrage, 1995). However, the prescriptive
validity of this statistical norm has rarely been questioned
(but see Krynski & Tenenbaum, 2007). We suggest that
approaching diagnostic inferences from the perspective of
causal reasoning may provide a more appropriate standard
of rational diagnostic inference and a better descriptive
model of peoples’ diagnostic judgments.

A Rational Model of Diagnostic Inference
The core idea behind our model is the assumption that diagnostic inferences operate over causal representations that are
estimated from data (cf. Krynski & Tenenbaum, 2007).
Thus, the data we encounter are typically interpreted as
arising from some unobserved causal processes, and our
inference goal when making predictive and diagnostic inferences is to reason about causal relations, not about the
noisy data we perceive.

Briefly, our model consists of the following five steps1: 1)
Specify alternative causal structures that may underlie the
data. 2) Use the data to estimate the parameter distributions
associated with each causal structure. 3) Compute P(c+|e+)
for each (parameterized) causal structure. 4) Compute the
posterior probability of each causal model. 5) Integrate out
the causal models to obtain an overall diagnostic judgment
P(c+|e+). We next describe these steps in more detail.
(1) Specifying alternative causal structures Given information about the co-occurrences of a single candidate cause
C and a single effect E there are three qualitatively different
causal structures that might underlie the observed data.
These three causal networks, in the following denoted as
M0, M1, and M2 are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Alternative causal models which may underlie a
co-occurrence of a cause event C and an effect event E.
Each causal structure consists of a set of nodes, which
represent the domain variables, and directed edges (“causal
arrows”), which represent hypotheses about the presence of
causal influences connecting the variables. Thus, a core
feature of such causal model representations is that they
mirror a characteristic feature of our environment, namely
the fact that some events, causes, have the power to generate
or prevent other events, their effects.
Each structure expresses a different qualitative hypothesis
about the generative causal processes assumed to underlie
the observation of C and E. According to model M0, there is
no causal relation between C and E. Though the two events
may sometimes co-occur, the effect is generated by some
unobserved background cause (A). The second structure,
M1, states there exists a causal relation between C and E,
that is, when C occurs it has the power to produce E. However, there are also alternative background causes that can
generate the effect. Finally, according to structure M2, event
C is the only cause of E, as indicated by the missing arrow
from A to E. Thus, C is necessary for the occurrence of E.
Note that structures M0 and M2, respectively, are not merely special cases of structure M1, but constitute qualitatively
different, less complex hypotheses suggesting different
causal explanations for the observed data. For example, due
to their simpler form causal structures M0 or M2 may have a
higher posterior probability than structure M1 (i.e., Bayesian
Occam’s Razor), which would not be possible if the former
were merely special cases of the latter. Rather, the models
form the background against which the observed data is

P(D | w) is the likelihood of the data given the parameter
values for wbc, wc, and wa, and P(w) refers to the joint prior
probability of the parameters. The prior distributions of the
parameters wbc, wc, and wa, are independently set to flat,
uninformative Beta(1, 1) distributions (e.g., Anderson,
1990; Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005). Under a noisy-OR
parameterization (e.g., Pearl, 2000), for which Cheng’s
(1997) causal power measure is the maximum likelihood
estimate (MLE), the likelihood function P(D | w) is given by

evaluated. This, for example, allows the model to be sensitive to the question to what extent some data D provides
evidence for or against the existence of particular causal
relations potentially underlying the observations (see also
Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005).
(2) Parameter estimation Connected with each causal
structure is a set of parameters w: wbc denotes the base rate
of cause C, wc denotes the causal strength of C, and wa encodes the causal influence of an amalgam of further (unobserved) background causes of E.2 By Bayes’ rule, the posterior probability distributions of each model’s parameters
given the data, P(w | D), is proportional to the likelihood of
the data given the parameter set w:

The posterior distributions of the parameters P(w | D) are
derived separately for each of the three causal structures.
For structure M1 the parameter set consists of wbc, wc, and
wa. By contrast, M0 and M2 have only two parameters whose
probability distributions are updated in light of the available
evidence. According to M0, there is no causal relation between C and E, therefore only estimates for wbc and wa are
derived. Conversely, M2 represents the possibility that there
are no alternative causes. Therefore, only estimates for wbc
and wc are being computed. Note that the derived parameter
distributions differ depending on the assumed causal structure. For example, given some data D the posterior distributions on wc are not the same under structures M1 and M2.
(3) Deriving P(c+|e+) The next step is to derive an estimate of the diagnostic probability P(c+|e+; Mi, w) under the
different models given their parameters. According to structure M0, there is no causal link between C and E, therefore
observing E provides no diagnostic evidence for C. Thus,
P(c+|e+; M0, w) = P(c+; w) = wbc. In structure M1, P(c+|e+) is
derived under the noisy-OR assumption:

Depending on the parameters’ prior distributions this estimate may or may not coincide with the empirical conditional probability.

Finally, structure M2 expresses the possibility that C is the
only existing cause of E. Therefore, whenever effect event E
is present, it is certain that C is also present. Thus, P(c+|e+;
M2, w) = 1. The target inference for each structure can be
computed by integrating over the parameters’ values.3
(4) Computing the models’ posterior probabilities The
posterior probability of the models is proportional to the
likelihood of the data given the models, weighted by the
prior probability of the model (Bayes’ rule):

(5)

P(D | Mi) is the likelihood of the data given structure Mi,
which is simply the integral over the likelihood function of
the parameters under structure Mi.4 P(Mi) denotes the prior
probability of structure Mi. We assume that prior to observing any data all three models are equally likely, thus, P(M0)
= P(M1) = P(M2) = 1/3.
One way to analyze how the predictions of naïve Bayes
differ from our model is to look at data sets for which naïve
Bayes predicts identical judgments, whereas our model
predicts differences. Figure 2a shows the causal models’
posterior probabilities for three different data sets with a
fixed conditional probability of the cause given the effect
(i.e., P(c+|e+) = 0.75) and varying probability of the effect
given the cause (0.9, 0.6, and 0.3, respectively). Since the
value of P(e+|c+) provides the upper boundary for the causal
strength estimate of C this variation strongly affects the
likelihood of the three causal models (M0, M1, M2). In particular, the probability of M1 and M0 varies systematically
with the value of P(e+|c+): the weaker this relation is, the
more likely M0 becomes, since a weak observed contingency may merely be a coincidence. When P(e+|c+) = 0.9, M1 is
the most likely model, but when P(e+|c+) = 0.3 both structures M1 and M0 are equally likely. The probability of M2
remains at zero since in all data sets the effect sometimes
occurs in the absence of the candidate cause.
(5) Integrating out the causal models The final step is to
integrate out the alternative causal structures to obtain a
single value for the diagnostic probability P(c+|e+). This is

done by summing over the values of P(c+|e+; Mi) derived
under each causal model weighted by the posterior probability of the respective model:

(6)

The result of this Bayesian model averaging is a single value for P(c+|e+), that takes into account uncertainty about
causal structures and parameter estimates. Fig. 2b shows
how the resulting estimate for P(c+|e+) deviates from the
empirical probability. A comparison with Fig. 2a shows that
this downward trend is due to the increased likelihood of
structure M0 across the three data sets: the more likely M0
becomes, the stronger the derived estimate of P(c+|e+) deviates from the empirical conditional probability.
Asymmetries between diagnostic and predictive inferences The analyses also reveal an interesting asymmetry
between predictive and diagnostic inferences.5 Whereas our
model predicts that diagnostic judgments should be affected
by the predictive probability and by the causal strength of
the target cause, the converse is not necessarily true. Thus,
predictive judgments should usually only be affected by the
predictive probability P(e+|c+), but not by the diagnostic
probability P(c+|e+). The reason for this asymmetry is that
under structure M0 the estimated value of wa is larger than
under M1 since all occurrences of the effect must necessarily
be attributed to the influence of the background causes. As a
consequence, an increase in the likelihood of M0 usually
entails only a small decrease for estimates of P(e+|c+) when
integrating out the causal models. Figures 2c and 2d illustrate this prediction for three data sets with a fixed level of
P(e+|c+) but different values of P(c+|e+) (1.0, 0.75, and 0.6,
respectively). The figure also shows that M2 is the most
likely model when the effect never occurs in the absence of
the target cause, which entails that P(c+|e+) = 1.0.
Summary The presented model provides a rational account
of diagnostic reasoning. Because the computations involve
alternative hypotheses about the existence and strength of
causal dependencies, the model’s predictions substantially
5
Predictive inferences from cause to effect are modeled analogously to the diagnostic inferences. Thus, an estimate of P(e+|c+)
is derived under the three causal structures, which are then integrated out to obtain a single estimate.

Experiment 1
The main goal of Experiment 1 was to investigate whether
people’s diagnostic judgments are indeed not only affected
by the diagnostic probability P(c+|e+), but also by the predictive probability P(e+|c+) and the causal strength of the candidate cause. We therefore factorially combined three levels
of the diagnostic probability P(c+|e+) (1.0, 0.75, and 0.6,
respectively) with three levels of the predictive probability
P(c+|e+) (0.9, 0.6, and 0.3, respectively). The resulting nine
conditions are shown in Table 1.
Participants and Design Thirty-six University of Göttingen
undergraduates participated for course credit. The factors
‘learning data’ and ‘type of causal judgment’ (predictive vs.
diagnostic) were varied within subjects.
Instructions We used a medical scenario according to
which physicians are investigating how certain diseases
causally relate to the presence of certain substances found in
the blood of people. Participants were told that they would
be requested to make two judgments after being presented
with some data. They were informed that one question
would require them to make an inference from the cause
event (disease) to the effect event (substance), whereas the
second question would refer to a diagnostic inference question from effect (substance) to its potential cause (disease).

Learning Data Subsequent to reading the instructions participants received a sheet of paper presenting 40 (randomized) individual cases referring to patients who had been
tested for the presence of the disease and substance, respectively (Table 1). Each disease-substance combination was
denoted by different (fictitious) labels (e.g., Midosis/Rothan). The order of the nine disease-substance combinations was counterbalanced across subjects.
Test Phase After examining the data sheet, participants
were presented with the two test questions, with the order of
questions being counterbalanced across participants. The
predictive question reads like this (translated from German):
“How certain are you that a novel patient who has been
infected with [Midosis] has the substance [Rothan] in his
blood?” Estimates were given on a rating scale ranging from
“0 = I am absolutely certain that the patient does not have

the substance in his blood“ to “7 = I am absolutely certain
that the patient does have the substance in his blood”. The
diagnostic question asked for an inference from effect to
cause: “How certain are you that a novel patient who has the
substance [Rothan] in his blood has been infected with [Midosis]?” The rating scale ranged from “0 = I am absolutely
certain that the patient does not have the disease “ to “7 = I
am absolutely certain that the patient does have the disease”.
Subsequent to answering the two questions participants
proceeded to the next disease-substance combination.
Results and Discussion Table 2 shows participants’ responses to the predictive and diagnostic inference questions.
A first inspection of the data indicates that the predictive
judgments were not affected by the diagnostic probability
P(c+|e+), but that the diagnostic causal judgments seem to
decrease proportionally to the size of the predictive probability P(e+|c+).

data (“naїve Bayes”). These analyses demonstrate that causal norms and statistical norms do not necessarily coincide
and illustrates how rational Bayesian causal inference can
lead to very different predictions than a purely statistical
account.

For the predictive inference questions, an analysis of variance with level of predictive probability P(e+|c+) and level
of diagnostic probability P(c+|e+) as within-subject variables revealed a main effect of predictive probability,
F(2, 70) = 100.7, p < .001, but no effect of diagnostic probability, F(2, 70) = 1.29, p = .28. Thus, participants’ responses to the predictive causal inference questions were
only determined by the predictive probability P(e+|c+). The
same analysis was conducted for the diagnostic questions.
Not surprisingly, participants’ responses to these questions
were strongly influenced by the diagnostic probability
P(c+|e+), F(2, 70) = 74.02, p < .001. However, the analysis
also revealed a strong influence of the predictive probability
P(e+|c+), F(2, 70) = 12.83, p < .001. The lower the predictive probability P(e+|c+), the lower the diagnostic judgments
turned out to be, despite identical empirical probabilities
P(c+|e+). An exception seemed to be when the cause is a
necessary event for the effect (i.e., when P(c+|e+) = 1.0);
here the response pattern indicates only a weak influence of
the predictive probability P(e+|c+). As a consequence, the
analysis also revealed a significant interaction,
F(4, 140) = 2.51, p < .05.
Taken together, these results show that participants’ predictive judgments were only affected by the probability of
the effect given the cause, while the diagnostic inferences
were affected by both the predictive and diagnostic proba-

2179

Experiment 2
The goal of Experiment 2 was to examine more closely
conditions in which the candidate cause is necessary for the
effect, which implies that observations of the effect are
perfectly diagnostic for the candidate cause. The diagnostic
probability P(c+|e+) was fixed to values of 1.0 and 0.8, respectively, whereas the predictive probability P(e+|c+) could
take values of 0.8 and 0.4. The conditions in which
P(c+|e+) = 1.0 provide an interesting test case as our model
predicts no influence of the predictive probability in this
case. The reason is that in these conditions structure M2
(which entails that P(c+|e+) = 1.0)) has the highest posterior
probability of all three models (cf. Fig. 2c). By contrast, for
the two conditions in which P(c+|e+) = 0.8 an influence of
the predictive probability is predicted since structure M0 is
more likely when P(e+|c+) = 0.4 than when P(e+|c+) = 0.8.
Participants and Design Ninety-six University of Göttingen undergraduates participated for course credit or were
paid 5€. The factor ‘learning data’ was varied between subjects, the factor ‘type of causal judgment’ (predictive vs.
diagnostic) was varied within subjects. We used the same
procedure and materials as in Experiment 1.

(i.e., P(e+|c+) = 0.4), t(46) = 1.89, p < .05 (one-tailed). By
contrast, the predictive probability had no influence on the
diagnostic judgments when the cause was necessary for the
occurrence of the effect (i.e., when P(c+|e+) = 1.0). In these
conditions equal estimates were obtained regardless of the
predictive strength of the candidate cause.

decreased with the predictive strength of the cause event.
These patterns clearly support our rational model and indicate that participants attempted to make assessments on the

In summary, in Experiment 2 two major findings were obtained. First, in the conditions in which the target cause was
not a necessary event for the occurrence of the effect (i.e.,
P(c+|e+) = 0.8), participants’ diagnostic judgments again
declined with the decrease of the predictive probability
P(e+|c+). These results replicate the previous findings in a
between-subjects design. The second result concerns the
conditions in which P(c+|e+) = 1.0, for which our model
predicts that the value of P(c+|e+) should not affect the diagnostic judgments. Consistent with this prediction, no
influence of the strength of the predictive relation was obtained between these conditions.

questions were only determined by the value of the predictive probability P(e+|c+), F(1, 92) = 53.45, p < .001, but not
by the diagnostic probability. Similarly, the obtained diagnostic judgments systematically varied with the level of the
diagnostic probability, F(1, 92) = 12.18, p < .001. A more
detailed analysis of the diagnostic responses revealed an
interesting asymmetry between the conditions in which the
target cause was necessary and those in which the effect
also occurred in the absence of the target cause. For the two
conditions in which the target cause was not necessary for
the occurrence of the effect (i.e., P(c+|e+) = 0.8), participants’ judgments again systematically varied in accordance
with the predictive strength of the target cause. Thus, people
were more certain that the target cause would be present
when the cause had a high predictive power (i.e.,

The previous two experiments demonstrated how people’s
diagnostic inferences are systematically influenced by the
probability with which the effect occurs in the presence of
the candidate cause. In these studies, the diagnostic probability P(c+|e+) was fixed at constant levels by decreasing
P(e+|c-) along with P(e+|c+) (i.e., by varying the strength of
the (unobserved) alternative cause). In Experiment 3 we
fixed the strength of the unobserved background cause to
P(c+|e-) = 0.2. To fix the diagnostic probability to two different levels (0.8 and 0.4, respectively) we varied the base
rate P(c+) accordingly (Table 3). The rational model again
predicts that the diagnostic judgments would decrease with
a decline of the predictive probability P(e+|c+ ).
Participants and Design Thirty-two University of Göttingen undergraduates participated for course credit or were
paid 5€. The factors ‘learning data’ and ‘type of causal
judgment’ (predictive vs. diagnostic) were varied within
subjects. We used the same procedure and materials as before.

and diagnostic probability P(c+|e+) (0.8 vs. 0.4) as withinsubject variables revealed only a main effect of predictive
probability, F(1, 31) = 68.78, p < .001, but no effect of the
diagnostic probability and no interaction. By contrast, participants’ responses to the diagnostic inference questions
were not only influenced by the value of P(c+|e+),
F(1, 31) = 16.53, p < .001, but also by the predictive probability P(e+|c+), F(1, 31) = 14.25, p < .001.
Thus, as in Experiments 1 and 2 participants’ estimates for
the predictive inference questions were only influenced by
the predictive power of the candidate cause, P(e+|c+), their
diagnostic causal judgments were not only determined by
the diagnostic probability P(c+|e+), but also by the causal
strength of the candidate cause. This pattern again supports
our rational model in a situation in which the diagnostic
probabilities in the data were fixed by varying the base rate
of the target cause.

General Discussion

References

We have presented a rational model of diagnostic reasoning
based on the framework of causal-model theory and causal
Bayesian inference. The key feature of this model is that it
assumes that diagnostic inferences operate on the causal
level, and therefore are sensitive to the noise inherent in the
data that are used to infer the underlying causal relations. As
a consequence, the model’s predictions strongly deviate
from a purely data oriented statistical account, which is
often considered the normative benchmark for diagnostic
inferences. Our studies revealed that participants’ diagnostic
judgments were systematically affected by the predictive
relation between cause and effect and therefore by the causal power of the target cause. This inference pattern is at
variance with a purely statistical model (“naïve Bayes”) but
consistent with a rational causal inference strategy that goes
“beyond the information given.”
Another weakness of using a purely statistical framework
is that it lacks the representational power to express different types of diagnostic queries. A causal inference framework, by contrast, does not only allow us to compute how
likely the candidate cause is present given the occurrence of
the effect. It can also be used to provide an answer to other
queries, for example concerning the degree of “causal responsibility,” which refers to the probability that the observed effect was indeed produced by the candidate cause
(cf. Cheng & Novick, 2005). In related research we have
extended the presented model to inferences regarding this
quantity, too, and we have also been able to disentangle
different types of diagnostic queries empirically. In addition,
we have also applied the model to more complex situations
involving multiple observed causes.
In summary, we suggest that acquiring causal knowledge
about a domain may be viewed as a fundamental distal goal
of an agent with data providing the proximal evidence for
achieving this goal. Causal model representations which
take into account the generative nature of the causal
processes in the environment enable the agent to reach her
distal goals, such as prediction, diagnosis, and planning of
