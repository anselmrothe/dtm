teraction because they are constructed using a recurrent neural network. Furthermore, those two models can adequately
cover many kinds of metaphorical expressions because they
are based on a statistical language analysis. While Terai &
Nakagawa’s (2007) model suffers somewhat in its inability to
distinguish targets and vehicles, because it is based on a comparison theory, Terai & Nakagawa’s (2008) model avoids that
problem because it is based on a categorization theory. The
later model is also capable of computing feature emergence
within the metaphor understanding process, and its psychological validity has been examined in an experiment. A parameter of the model indicates the strength of interaction influence, which makes it possible to simulate the understanding process either with many emergent features or without
emergent features. Hence, this paper conduct a psychological
experiment using the results of Terai & Nakagawa’s (2008)
model simulation in order to clarify the mechanism of feature
emergence with consideration for individual differences.
The procedure for conducting the experiment is as follows:
Step 1: The model simulates three versions of the metaphor
understanding process (with many emergent features, with
few emergent features, and without any emergent features)
by changing the value of the parameter representing the influence of interaction. Specifically, the parameter value determines of the level of feature emergence within the metaphor
understanding process. The model outputs three kinds of feature sets as interpretations of a metaphor in accordance with
the parameter values.
Step 2: In order to clarify whether feature emergence occurs
as part of the understanding process for a given participant,
the participants are asked to evaluate the validity of the various simulation results from Step 1. Thus, the Step 2 results
provide indication as to which parameter setting is the most
appropriately matches the metaphor understanding process of
each participant in question.
Step 3: The same participants from Step 2 evaluate the
characteristics of the metaphors (their conventionality, understandability, interestingness, and the similarity between a vehicle and a target).
Step 4: The mechanism of feature emergence is clarified by
identifying the relationships between feature emergence and
metaphor characteristics obtained at Steps 2 and 3.

rization process and a dynamic interaction process. Firstly,
the knowledge structure of concepts is estimated through statistical language analysis (Kameya & Sato, 2005) employing extracted frequency data for adjective-noun modifications and three types of verb-noun modification in Japanese.
The statistical method assumes that the terms ni (noun) and
a j (adjective or verb) co-occur through latent classes and that
the co-occurrence probabilities of these terms, P(ni , a j ), can
be computed using formula(1).
P(ni , a j ) = ∑k P(ni |ck )P(a j |ck )P(ck ),

(1)

where ck indicates the k-th latent class assumed in the method.
The parameters (P(ni |ck ), P(a j |ck ), and P(ck )) are estimated
as the value that maximizes the log likelihood of the cooccurrence frequency data between ni and a j using the EM
algorithm. In this paper, these parameters are estimated from
extracted data consists of 21,671 noun types and 3,403 adjective types for adjective-noun modifications, 29,745 noun
types and 22,832 verb types for verb-noun(object), 26,113
noun types and 21,487 verb types for noun(subject)-verb,
and 28,451 noun types and 24,231 verb types for verbnoun(modification). The model deals with the 18,142 noun
types (ni ) that are common to all four types of modification
data. The conditional probability of the latent class ck given
the noun ni (P(ck |ni )) is computed using Bayes’ theory. The
nouns(concepts) are represented by vectors using the conditional probability (P(ck |ni )).
In the categorization process model, a vector, representing
an assigned target as a member of an ad hoc category for a
vehicle, is estimated based on a categorization theory using
the meaning vectors of concepts. The algorithm for the categorization process is as follows. First, the semantic neighborhood (N(ni )) of a vehicle of size s is computed on the basis of
similarity to the vehicle, which is represented by the cosine
of the angles between meanings. Next, L concepts are selected from the semantic neighborhood (N(ni )) of the vehicle
on the basis of similarity to the target (L indicates the number
of the selected concepts). Finally, a vector is computed for
the centroid of the meaning vectors for the target, the vehicle and the selected L concepts as the vector representing the
assigned target as a member of the ad hoc category for a vehicle. The computed vector represents the assigned target as a
member of an ad hoc category for a vehicle and the vector is
indicated using V (M). The strength of relationship between
feature a j (adjectives or verbs) and V (M) is indicated using
P(a j |M).

Model Simulation of Metaphor Understanding
In order to represent the metaphor understanding processes
with many emergent features, with a few emergent features and without any emergent features, Terai & Nakagawa’s(2008) model of metaphor understanding is used. It
can represent many types of metaphor understanding processes relating to feature emergence by changing the value
of the parameter that represents the influences of interaction
among features.

In the dynamic interaction process model, the meaning of
a metaphor is computed using the meaning vectors estimated
by the categorization process(P(a j |M)) by applying the dynamic interaction process model using a recurrent neural network model(Fig.1). Each node corresponds to a feature and
there are connections. These nodes have both inputs and outputs. The dynamics of the network are based on the following

where xq (t) represents the activation strength of the q-th node
at time t. The range is between 1 and 0. exp(−α t) is the
term for convergence which decreases according to time t.
When dxq /dt = 0, the node outputs Oq (M) = xq (t). The
vector(O(M)), which is a set of Oq (M), represents the meaning of the metaphor M. Iq (M) represents the input value of the
q-th node related to the metaphor M. The value of P(a j(q) |M)

features for the target and for the vehicle, while participants
in the other group were asked to respond with appropriate
features for the metaphor. Features given by three or more
participants were regarded as being appropriate features for
the vehicle, the target, or the metaphor, respectively, while the
features that were given as being appropriate for the metaphor
but not for the vehicle or the target were regarded as emergent features. The pilot study results indicate that the emergent features of ”difficulty like a wall” are ”run over”, ”get”,
and ”block”. The model with β = 0.3 and β = 0.6 estimates
”be blocked” (as passive of ”block”) as the 9th most salient
feature and as the 7th most salient feature, respectively. The
model with β = 0.3 and β = 0.6 estimates the passive feature which is defined as the emergent feature through the pilot study. The results also demonstrate that the β value represents the extent of feature emergence within the metaphor
understanding process.

The Results of the Model Simulations
The model simulated the metaphor understanding processes
concerning 16 metaphors in Japanese.
In a previous
study(Nakamoto & Kusumi, 2004), 120 metaphors were classified into 7 categories based on their characteristics. Three
metaphors were selected from two categories consisting of
very understandable metaphors and 2 metaphors were extracted from each of the other categories. These 16 metaphors
are presented in Table1.
The model was simulated using the fixed parameters of
s = 50, L = 3, α = ln(10). The value of the parameter β was
changed β = 0, β = 0.3 and β = 0.6. The simulation results
with β = 0 correspond to metaphor understanding without
feature emergence, the simulation results with β = 0.3 correspond to low occurrences of feature emergence, while the
results with β = 0.6 correspond to metaphor understanding
with a considerable level of feature emergence. The simulation results are shown in Table2.
The pilot study was conducted for the purpose of confirming the efficiency of the parameter β. The participants were
85 undergraduates, who were divided into two groups (Group

Evaluating the Validity of the Simulation Results
In order to clarify whether feature emergence occurs within
the understanding process of a given participant, the participants evaluated the validity of the simulation results. The
participants were presented with each metaphor and the three
simulation results (top 10 features) with β = 0, β = 0.3 and
β = 0.6, although the significance of the different output values was hidden with a story about them being the results
from three different computers (Computer A, Computer B
and Computer C). The participants were asked to evaluate the
validity of each interpretation and to choose one computer
that had simulates the most appropriate interpretations.
In this paper, β∗ indicates the β that was used in the simulation that yielded the results that were selected as being the
most appropriate interpretation. The mean and the entropy of
β∗ , as well as the mean ratings for the simulation results using
β∗ , are shown in Table3.
On the scale, 5 corresponded to ”slightly agree that the
interpretation is appropriate” (with 4 being ”neutral”). The
rating means for 14 metaphors are in excess of 5, while the
means for the remaining two metaphors are in excess of 4.
These results indicate the validity of the simulation results.
The entropy of β∗ represents the individual difference in
terms of feature emergence. If one third of the participants
chose β∗ = 0, one third chose β∗ = 0.3 and the other one
third chose β∗ = 0.6, the entropy of β∗ would be 1.59. The
entropies for 2 metaphors are less than 1. This indicates that
there are individual differences relating to feature emergence
within each metaphor understanding process.

Relationships between Feature Emergence and the
Metaphor Characteristics
In order to clarify the relationships between feature emergence and metaphor characteristics, a number of statistical
analyses are conducted using 717 responses (45 participants
multiplied by 16 metaphors minus 3 not available responses).
A one-way analysis of variance was carried out to examine
the differences in the ratings for each characteristic as a function of the β used for the simulation results that were chosen as being the most appropriate interpretation (β∗ ). The
results indicated that while there were no significance differences for conventionality, interestingness and similarity,
there was a significantly effect of β∗ for understandability

understandability groups and the conventionality groups is
shown in Tab.6.
The number of responses in the low-understandability and
the high-conventionality cell is only 4. Hence, these 4
cases were ignored, and a one-way analysis of variance was
conducted to test for differences between the other three
cells (high-understandability and high-conventionality (HH), high-understandability and low-conventionality (H-L),
and low-understandability and low-conventionality (L-L)) as
a function of β∗ . The results indicated a significant effect
of β∗ on these three groupings (F(2,710)=5.21, P<.001), as
shown in Fig.4.
The results indicate that the value of β∗ was highest for
the L-L grouping, while the value of β∗ was lowest for the
H-L grouping. Thus, while feature emergence would seem
to occur when a metaphor is neither understandable nor conventional, feature emergence seems to happen less when a
metaphor is very understandable but not conventional.

indicated a marginally significant interaction in terms of conventionality (as showing in Table5 and Fig.3). However, no
significance differences were observed in terms of interestingness and similarity. These findings indicate that feature

conventionality and understandability characteristics.

also be possible to investigate such relationships in greater

(B)(19330156).

In order to clarify individual differences in terms of feature
emergence, the entropy values for β∗ were analyzed. Similar to the previous analysis, the metaphors were divided into
three groups (H-H, H-L, L-L) based on the mean understandability ratings and the mean conventionality ratings. This resulted in 6 metaphors being classified into the H-H group, 5
metaphors for the H-L group, and 5 metaphors for the L-L
group. The results of a one-way analysis of variance for the
value of β∗ indicated that there was a significant difference
between the L-L group and H-L group. Hence, the difference
in entropy between the H-L group and the L-L group was
tested using a t-test. The results indicated that the mean of
β∗ for the H-L group (1.47) was significantly higher than the
mean for the L-L group (1.26) at 10% level (t(9)=1.93,p<.1).
This finding indicates that there are greater individual differences in terms of feature emergence for the H-L group
metaphors than for the L-L group metaphors.

Discussion
In order to examine the mechanism of feature emergence
without ignoring individual differences, a psychological experiment was conducted using simulation results for Terai
& Nakagawa’s (2008) model. The results of the experiment indicate that feature emergence occurs when a metaphor
is neither understandable nor conventional, but that it happens less a metaphor is very understandable but not conventional. The results also indicate that participants tend to be
more consistent in their processing of metaphors that are neither understandable nor conventional, but that there is greater
individual variation when processing of metaphors that are
very understandable but not conventional. These findings
suggest that metaphors that are not understandable cannot
be comprehended only with the high-salient features of the
target and the vehicle, and that they require the additional
activation of emergent features. The finding of no significant differences between the high-understandability and highconventionality (H-H) group and the low-understandability
and low-conventionality (L-L) group seems to suggest that,
while some metaphors require some level of activation of
emergent features to be understood, some metaphors become
sufficiently familiar that they can be understood more readily.
