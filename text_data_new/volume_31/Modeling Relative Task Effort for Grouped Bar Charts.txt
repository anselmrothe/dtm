Abstract
The overall goal of our research is a system which can recognize the intended message of a grouped bar chart by reasoning about the communicative signals contained in the graphic.
One such communicative signal is the relative effort required to
perform different perceptual tasks on the graphic. This paper
presents our methodology for estimating relative task effort.
Based on graph comprehension research and our motivational
eye tracking experiments, we hypothesize a set of factors that
should be taken into account in a model of task effort. We
present our model, implemented in the ACT-R framework, and
discuss the results of a final set of eye tracking experiments
that validate our model as a predictor of relative task effort.

Information graphics, ranging from simple bar charts and line
graphs to grouped bar charts and multiple line graphs, play a
prominent role in today’s information age. When such graphics appear in popular media, they generally have a communicative goal or message that they are intended to convey. For
example, the message conveyed by the top graphic in Figure 1
is ostensibly that female salaries lag behind male salaries in
all of the disciplines listed. Our research has shown that when
information graphics appear in popular media, their intended
message is very often not repeated in the article’s text and
cannot be gleaned from the graphic’s caption(Carberry, Elzer,
& Demir, 2006). Thus, recognizing the graphic’s message
is fundamental to the two applications that we are pursuing:
1) constructing a rich summary of a multimodal document
and 2) providing sight-impaired individuals with alternative
access to information graphics in popular media via a brief
summary of the graphic.
Our previous research produced a Bayesian network that
uses the communicative signals present in a simple bar chart
as evidence in hypothesizing the graphic’s message(Elzer
et al., 2005). We are now extending our methodology to
grouped bar charts, which are considerably more complex
than simple bar charts and present additional challenges. One
of the most important communicative signals is the relative
effort of different perceptual tasks.1 For example, consider
1 Other communicative signals include whether a group is highlighted, the position of a group in the chart, etc.

the two graphics in Figure 1, both of which display the same
data. In the top graphic, it is easy to perceptually compare
the salaries of males and females in each discipline, and the
graphic’s intended message is ostensibly that female salaries
lag behind male salaries in all of these disciplines. While
these comparisons can also be made in the bottom graphic,
they are much more difficult due to the design of the graphic.
Thus, the bottom graphic appears to convey a different message. This correlates with Larkin and Simon (1987) who observe that informationally equivalent graphics are not necessarily computationally equivalent, and with Peebles and
Cheng (2003) who note that seemingly minor design changes
can greatly affect a graph viewer’s performance on graph
reading tasks. Thus perceptual task effort affects the message
that is conveyed by a grouped bar chart.

This paper presents our model of relative task effort for
grouped bar charts. Note that our goal is not a cognitive
model of human graph comprehension, but rather a model
that takes into account cognitive and perceptual aspects of the
graphic to estimate the relative effort required to perform relevant recognition tasks. Our aim is to develop this model with
solid cognitive underpinnings and to validate it with sound
experimental data. In future research, we will incorporate the
results of this model into a Bayesian network and use this
evidence alongside other communicative signal evidence to
hypothesize the intended message of a grouped bar chart.

Related Work
There has been much work on graph comprehension. Classical graph work such as Lohse (1993), Meyer (2000), and
Simkin and Hastie (1987) involve the modeling of specific
fact-retrieval tasks on a graph. Shah, Freedman, and Vekiri
(2005) are concerned with how quantitative information is
comprehended from graphics. Freedman and Shah (2002) use
a constraint-satisfaction approach and consider the graphic
viewer’s prior knowledge. Our work differs from these and
other efforts in that rather than modeling human processing,
our emphasis lies in estimating and ranking the relative effort
of different message recognition tasks. Our work is similar
in that it must take into account both graphic complexity and
the human-visual architecture.

Messages and Task Effort
In this paper, we will consider five general categories of messages that are common in grouped bar charts, and we will
model the effort required to perform the task of extracting
these messages from a graphic. We hypothesize that the more
difficult a message is to extract, the less likely it is that the
graphic was intended to convey that message.
• Same-relation: a set of entities have the same relationship to one another over an ontology. The top graphic in
Figure 1 has an intended message that falls into the samerelation category, as does Figure 3 whose intended message is that rural households have less internet access than
urban households at all income levels.
• Contrast-relation: a set of entities have a different relation to one another at one place in an ontology compared
with everywhere else in the ontology. Figure 1 would contain such a contrast-relation message if female salaries exceeded males salaries for one of the listed disciplines.
• Same-trend: several entities have the same trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) over some ordinal set (such as
years, ages, etc.). Figure 2 is an example of a grouped
bar chart whose intended message falls into the same-trend
category. A same-trend message can also be extracted from
Figure 3.
• Contrast-trend: one entity has a different trend from the
other entities. This would be the case if the group labeled

Figure 3: Graphic from Business Week, “A Small Town Reveals America’s Digital Divide”, October 4, 1999.
“Philadelphia to New York” in Figure 2 displayed decreasing prices from Sept. to Feb.
• Gap-trend: The gap between entities is generally changing in the same direction (increasing or decreasing) over
an ontology. Such a gap-trend message could be extracted
from Figure 3 (although it is effortful to do so) since the
gap between internet access for rural and urban households
is generally increasing across income levels.
We have developed a model for estimating the relative effort involved in extracting each of the above message types
for a given grouped bar chart, based on the design of the
graphic. In our work on simple bar charts, effort was modeled using a GOMS approach(Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983)
which decomposed tasks into perceptual subtasks, such as
‘find the top of a bar’. The effort for primitive subtasks was
estimated based on cost estimates by cognitive psychologists,
and the effort estimates for the subtasks were summed to provide an effort estimate for the composite task. Although this
GOMS approach worked well for modeling relative effort in
simple bar charts, grouped bar charts are much more complex
and can involve high dimensional relationships over multiple
sets of entities, as well as the inherent cognitive limitations
in extracting those messages. Thus we chose to use the ACT-

2293

R programmable framework(Anderson, Matessa, & Lebiere,
1997) which is an implemented cognitive theory with visual
and declarative modules that are relevant to the perception
and memory issues in modeling task effort. However, our
goal is NOT to construct a cognitive model that simulates how
humans comprehend graphs; instead we want to identify the
factors that make tasks on one graphic more difficult than on
another graphic and utilize them in a model that estimates the
relative difficulty of a task on a given graphic.

Factors that Affect Effort
We performed preliminary (motivational) eye tracking experiments with human subjects to gain insight into the factors
that affect task effort in grouped bar charts and to motivate the
design of our effort model. Subjects were given a grouped bar
chart and asked to perform a recognition task, during which
fixations and their durations were measured along with the
time to complete the task. Our observations from these experiments, along with previous research by cognitive psychologists and graph designers, suggest factors that should be incorporated into our model of task effort.
High-level Visual Patterns The presence of high-level visual patterns that can be easily perceived by the human visual
system appears to significantly affect the effort required to extract messages from grouped bar charts. When such patterns
were present, we observed fewer bar fixations and shorter
time for task completion in our preliminary eye tracking experiments.
Pinker (1990) identified various high-level visual patterns
such as linear lines or quadratic curves which are easily identifiable for most viewers. Shah, Mayer, and Hegarty (1999)
show that graph viewers use bottom-up visual pattern recognition in graph comprehension and note that the grouping of
data points in graph design will influence the perceived pattern recognition of trends. Applying this to identifying the
presence of messages in grouped bar charts, we note that attentions on successive bars which are positioned in a relatively straight line are not needed to determine that those bars
are indeed in a straight line. For example, one can very easily
recognize at a high-level that the bar heights in Figure 2 form
an increasing pattern. Other patterns, such as a “U” shape in
a same-relation message with 3 or more bars per group, also
appear to be perceived quickly without a fixation on each bar
in the pattern.
Peripheral Vision The concept of peripheral vision is
closely related to the idea of high-level visual patterns in
the domain of information graphics and the acceptance that
multiple objects can be processed in parallel in a guided
search(Anderson & Lebiere, 1998). Salvucci (2001) has
shown the ability to attend to an object without fixating on
it, in the domains of equation solving, reading, and visual
search. We have observed in our eye tracking experiments
that subjects do not always fixate on the first and last groups
of a graph, but theorize that subjects still attend to them. We

also hypothesize that the use of peripheral vision explains
why subjects in our eye tracking experiments did not fixate on every bar when identifying a same-trend message in
a grouped bar chart.
Exceptions We will refer to one or a couple of bars that
do not conform to an overall trend, such as the bars in the
groups ’02 and ’03 in Figure 4, as an exception. When given
a graphic with an overall trend but containing some exceptions, subjects tend to identify the trend, but take longer to do
so compared to a similar graph without exceptions. This increased processing time is the general result of more fixations
occurring on the graph, especially around the exception area.

Clutter Wickens and Carswell (1995) showed that performance in comprehension tasks degrades when visual clutter
increases, where visual clutter is the close spatial proximity of two perceptually or semantically contrasting elements
which should not be compared. The encoding time for one of
these elements increases because of the close proximity of the
other element’s “noise”. We have observed increased time for
recognition tasks on grouped bar charts when visual clutter is
present.
Spatial Reasoning Ability Trickett and Trafton (2006) theorize that spatial cognition is often used in graph comprehension. They hypothesize that one such spatial task is, for example, the mental averaging of bar heights within a group, for
performing the task of comparing the height of two groups.
They use the work of Simkin and Hastie (1987) in their modeling, whose superimposition elementary graph process involves a graph viewer spatially moving graph objects to create overlap and ease comparison with other graph objects. We
hypothesize that superimposition is present in the extraction
of some gap-trend messages.

Modeling in ACT-R and its Limitations
The ACT-R framework enables us to address many perceptual
and memory issues involved in our recognition tasks. For example, the imaginal module allows us to build a problem representation, and to handle frequent comparisons between an

2294

object of current attention and a representation of a previously
attended object. However, other aspects of ACT-R are inadequate for our needs. For example, ACT-R is unable to automatically recognize that the data points representing the tops
of a series of bars can be encoded bottom-up to form a single line object, unless that relationship is explicitly declared
in the model. Therefore, to implement pattern recognition,
we wrote a small script which takes as input a graphic’s data
points and automatically outputs any relevant high-level visual patterns present in the graphic. These high-level patterns
are then available for the ACT-R model to use in modeling
recognition tasks on the graphic.
We also incorporated EMMA, an ACT-R add-on(Salvucci,
2001) which was designed to model peripheral vision.
EMMA adjusts the constant visual encoding time cost of an
object into a variable cost, affected by the proximity of the
previous attention location. It is able to successfully model
that a “skipped fixation” will occur when two attentions are
approximately close and are executed successively.

Modeling Task Effort
This section briefly discusses the five categories of message recognition tasks and the implementation of our ACT-R
model of relative task effort.

Same-relation and Contrast-relation Tasks
When the relation being examined is among entities represented by adjacent bars in a group (such as the relation between rural and urban internet access in Figure 3 or the relation among train prices in Sept, Oct, and Feb2 for the three
trips depicted in Figure 2), high-level visual patterns may help
with recognizing a same or contrast relation. Therefore, when
the tops of the bars in a group represent a high-level visual
pattern (such as a “/” or a “U” shape), our ACT-R model encodes this pattern and models the same-relation and contrastrelation tasks as a comparison of the pattern with each group.
On the other hand, there may not be a common visual pattern; this happens when the tops of the bars do not represent
a common pattern (typically occurring with 4 or more bars
per group) or when the bars are so similar in height that a
more detailed examination is needed to discern which bar is
higher. In such cases, bar-by-bar processing of each group is
performed to determine whether there is a same or contrast
relation message. When there was a contrast-relation, our
motivational eye tracking experiments showed re-attentions
in the vicinity of the group that is in contrast with the other
groups, presumably to double-check the contrasting relation;
thus our model also includes an extra check.
In some cases, such as the bottom half of Figure 1, a
same-relation message (that female salaries lag behind male
salaries in each discipline) can be extracted from the graph
but the related bars are not adjacent to one another. For such
graphics, our ACT-R model must capture the extraction of the

not a same-relation message.

bars being compared (in the case of Figure 1, the female and
male salary bars for each discipline must be extracted from
different groups) and perform bar-by-bar comparisons to determine whether they have the same relation to one another
— resulting in many fixations and much cognitive processing, and therefore producing a high effort estimate.

Same-trend and Contrast-trend Tasks
In modeling the same-trend and contrast-trend recognition
tasks, we differentiate between intra-trends (where each
group in the grouped bar chart represents a trend, as in Figure 2) and inter-trends (where each series of bars across all
groups represents a trend, such as in Figures 3 and 4).
Intuitively, the recognition of an intra-trend requires that
one realize that a trend exists in each group of a graph. Therefore, the effort for this realization is dependent on both the
cost of recognizing each individual group trend and the number of groups. Thus one would expect that as the number of
groups in a graph increases, the effort and total time to realize
an intra-trend should increase as well. This was borne out in
our preliminary eye tracking experiments.
Our motivational eye tracking experiments also showed
that the number of bars per group did not significantly affect
recognition time. We hypothesize that this can be accounted
for by the human ability to recognize high-level visual patterns. Because the bars which form the trend over a group
can be encoded as a high-level line pattern, the recognition
of the trend at each group can occur without an exhaustive
fixation on every bar in the group. Thus our ACT-R model
scans group-by-group using high-level group attentions, and
compares the current group’s visual pattern with a pattern in
ACT-R’s imaginal module representing the pattern of the preceding group attention. Our experiments suggested that subjects re-attend on and around areas which semantically differ
from the surrounding areas and their expectations. Thus in the
case of a contrast-relation, our ACT-R model captures this extra effort by re-attending to the prior and succeeding groups
around any contrast.
Inter-trends consist of a series of bars across all groups (for
example, the increasing internet access over income levels
for both rural and urban residents in Figure 3). In our eye
tracking experiments, the fixations by subjects suggested that
they were both processing multiple trends in parallel and processing several adjacent bars in a trend with a single fixation.
This apparent use of peripheral vision is accounted for in our
model in two ways. When the tops of the bars in a series
are all approximately near the tops of the bars in another series, our ACT-R model marks one series as a “free” attention,
and attending to the non-free series automatically encodes the
trends of both that series and the “free” series. In addition, our
model does not fixate on each bar in a series, but instead uses
EMMA’s ability to capture attending to several close adjacent
bars with a single fixation.
However, since inter-trends are spread across groups, there
is opportunity for visual clutter, particularly when one trend
contrasts with the other trends in the graph — for example, a

2295

decreasing trend when the other trends are increasing. Thus
not only does our ACT-R model re-attend to contrasting intertrends, but it also re-attends to the bars in the area where the
contrasting trend crosses the other trends since this represents
an area of visual clutter.
For both intra-trends and inter-trends, our ACT-R model
re-attends to the bars around any exceptions to the trend. This
captures the extra processing observed in our eye tracking experiments and the resulting extra time to perform same-trend
and contrast-trend tasks in the presence of exceptions.

Gap-trend Task
The gap-trend messages that we have observed in our corpus of graphs3 consist of two bars per group. Based on the
work of Trickett and Trafton (2006), if the two series of bars
across all the groups are both increasing or both decreasing,
we hypothesize that superimposition is used in the gap comparison process. Our ACT-R model takes this into account by
fixating on a gap and superimposing it on the succeeding gap
to recognize whether the gap-trend is generally increasing or
decreasing over the graph.4
If the two series are moving in opposite directions, the
high-level visual pattern formed by the bar tops of the two series can generalize to resemble “<” or “>”, and would be easily recognizable.5 Thus our ACT-R model extracts the highlevel visual patterns for the two series and compares them.
As with trend messages, exceptions can occur and result in
re-attentions in the area of the exceptions.

subjects was randomized. Both the subjects and the graphics
used in this validation experiment were different from those
used in the preliminary eye tracking experiments.
For each graphic, an untimed instruction slide was first displayed explaining to the subject which task they were being asked to perform on the next graphic. The subject hit
the space bar after comprehending this instruction. Then
the graphic was displayed on the screen and the subject performed the requested recognition and then hit the space bar
again. In addition to gaze points, the elapsed time following
the onset display of the graphic and the hitting of the space
bar was also recorded. Then a multiple choice prompt was
displayed, and the subject was instructed to select the answer
corresponding to his/her response to the task.

Results and Analysis
For each of the 42 graphics that contained a trend, relation,
or gap-trend that the subject was supposed to recognize, we
computed the mean completion time for the human subjects6
and the effort estimate produced by our ACT-R model, where
the ACT-R effort estimate was in terms of task completion
time. Since our goal is to rank tasks on a graphic in terms
of their relative effort, we performed a Spearman Rank-Order
Correlation, which is used to determine whether two sets of
rank-ordered data are related; values approaching 1.0 show a
strong correlation. Table 1 shows the results of the correlations between the model’s effort estimates and average task
completion time for the human subjects.

Validation Experiment
Design
To evaluate our model for estimating relative task effort, we
performed an eye tracking validation experiment using a Tobii T60 system with 20 human subjects.
Each subject was initially presented with learning and
practice slides which explained the kinds of tasks that they
would be asked to perform and the concept of an exception
to a trend. Each subject was then presented with 52 graphics, and in each case the subject was asked to perform one
of the five tasks: determine whether there is 1) a same-trend,
2) a contrast-trend, 3) a same-relation, 4) a contrast-relation,
or 5) a gap-trend. 42 of the graphics contained a trend, relation, or gap-trend that the subject was supposed to identify
and the other 10 graphics did not. The graphics included both
intra and inter trends and varied in the number of groups, the
number of bars per group, and the presence of exceptions and
clutter. The order in which the graphics were presented to

extracted from a variety of popular media sources.

space(Hiatt, Trafton, & Harrison, 2004).
5 An “X” pattern can also occur, when the relation between the
bars changes — for example, when the first bar is taller than the
second bar for the beginning groups (with the gap between them
decreasing) and then the second bar becomes taller than the first bar.

The results in Table 1 show a strong correlation between
the relative task effort produced by our model and the ranking of graphics according to the average task completion time
by human subjects; this correlation holds both within the categories of tasks and more importantly, across all tasks. For
same/contrast-trend tasks which involved an inter-trend and
for same-relation tasks, the main disagreement in the rankings occurred in graphics where the estimated recognition
times by the model and the mean completion times by the
subjects differed only slightly. For same/contrast-trend tasks
that involved an intra-trend, differences in the rankings appear to reflect disagreement about how much extra effort is
needed when either a contrasting group or an increase in the
number of groups occurs. Our model estimates less time on

graphics with many groups and no contrasting group than it
does for graphics with fewer groups that include a contrasting
group, whereas subject completion times reflect the opposite.
Overall, the strong correlations displayed in Table 1 validate
our model of task effort.

Future Work
In the next phase of our project, our model will be used to
provide evidence about relative task effort for use with other
communicative signals in a Bayesian network to hypothesize
the intended message of a grouped bar chart. For example,
we processed both the top and bottom graphic of Figure 1
in our model of task effort. As hoped, the model estimated
that the top graphic required significantly less effort to recognize a same-relation message than the bottom graphic (approximately only a third of the time required by the bottom
graphic). This result suggests that our ACT-R model will
produce relative effort estimates that will serve as useful evidence in our Bayesian network.

Conclusion
We have developed a model of relative task effort on grouped
bar charts, implemented within the ACT-R framework. Our
model takes into account a number of factors that appear to
impact the requisite effort, including the recognition of highlevel visual patterns, the use of peripheral vision, the presence of exceptions and clutter, and the potential for spatial
reasoning. Our model was validated by a final set of eye
tracking experiments in which a strong correlation was shown
between the effort estimates produced by our model and the
average completion times of human subjects. Future work on
this project involves implementing a Bayesian network which
will use the communicative signals present in a grouped bar
chart, including relative task effort, to probabilistically reason
about the graphic’s intended message.
