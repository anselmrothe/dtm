Abstract: We report on preliminary tests of the hypothesis that creativity is correlated with degree of difference
between ones parents. The rationale is that different parental worldviews (1) require reconciliation/honing such that
the child develops a more complex worldview, and (2) accustom the child to thinking things through for him/herself.
Initial evidence from studies of creative thinking, creative personality traits, and parental differences are consistent
with this hypothesis. This is the case for both direct measures of creative thinking, and for indirect, trait-based
measures of creativity. We are testing the parental differences hypothesis using DAWN, a Kohonen-type neural
network model of how an integrated worldview emerges as patterns of associations, or indexical relations, across
inputs, or icons. Parental input is simulated by exposing DAWN to the outputs of parent networks of varying
degrees of similarity. The correlation between similarity of parent networks and creativity of DAWNs outputs is
being assessed.
