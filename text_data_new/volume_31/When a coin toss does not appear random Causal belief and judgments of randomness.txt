Abstract
Distinguishing between random and non-random data is
important for inductive reasoning. Prior research has found a
bias towards judging binary sequences with alternation rates
above 0.5 as most random. In most of this research the
concept of randomness was explained to participants via the
example of a coin being tossed. The current experiment
examined the influence of such example explanations on the
perception of the randomness of binary sequences.
Participants were told that sequences had been generated by a
coin toss, a basketball player taking free throws, or were
given no prior belief about the generating process (control). In
the control condition there was no bias towards rating high
alternation rate sequences as most random, however the bias
persisted when a causal mechanism (coin, basketball player)
was provided. Previously found correlations between
perceived memorisability and perceived randomness were
only found when a belief about the generating mechanism
was provided.
Keywords: randomness judgment; binary sequences; causal
belief; coin toss; gambler‟s fallacy; hot hand belief.

A coin being tossed is the classic example used to illustrate
randomness, as it satisfies many of the elusive features of
randomness. It has often been stated that randomness is hard
to define and requires consideration of the randomness of
the source as well as the output (e.g. Bar-Hillel &
Wagenaar, 1993; Falk & Konold, 1997; Nickerson, 2002).
Using a coin toss to explain what is meant by randomness
avoids complex and potentially biasing instructions in
experiments. Wagenaar (1972) comments that the coin toss
example is well accepted by participants as an “ideal
randomizer” (p. 112). There is a long history of research
into our understanding of randomness, much of it
concluding we are poor at both generating and judging
randomness (e.g. Falk & Konold, 1997; Tune, 1964;
Wagenaar, 1970a, 1970b; Weiss, 1965). In this paper we
will explore whether using examples like a coin toss have
actually impeded measurement of our understanding of
randomness.
When making predictions about future events we tend to
observe the past, look for patterns and then make inductions
about what is likely to occur in the future. Thus the ability
to distinguish between random and non-random sequences
is a key human behavior (Lopes, 1982). Statistical analysis
of sequence structure can provide details on how
representative each sequence or set of sequences is of a

stochastic process. A prototypically random sequence has an
alternation rate of 0.5 (Falk & Konold, 1997). Sequence
alternation rate describes the proportion of times an
outcome is the opposite of the previous one. Sequences with
long runs of one outcome have low alternation rates while
those where the outcome changes frequently have high
alternation rates.

Judging Randomness
While early research into our understanding of randomness
focused on generation of random sequences, Wagenaar
(1970a) suggested that judgment tasks better assess our
understanding as they avoid attentional and memory
limitations which could impact generation performance. In
judgment tasks people select random sequences from sets of
sequences with varying properties. As generation studies
had found that people tend to produce sequences with too
many alternations between outcomes, Wagenaar studied the
effect of manipulating sequence alternation rate on
perceptions of randomness. Wagenaar (1970a) found that,
consistent with the generation studies, people have a
tendency to select sequences with alternation rates around
0.6 as the most random. This indicates a bias towards
judging sequences with too many alternations as ideally
random. The preference for alternation in both judgment
and generation tasks is consistent with the gambler‟s
fallacy, that is, the belief that following a run of one
outcome, the other outcome is now due.
Similar studies by Falk (1981), and Falk and Konold
(1997) also found that people tend to rate sequences with
alternation rates around 0.6 to 0.7 as the most random. Falk
and Konold propose perceived sequence complexity as the
mechanism underlying the bias in randomness ratings. That
is, people decide how complex a sequence appears and use
this to rate its randomness. To study this, they equated
perceived sequence complexity with judgments of sequence
encoding difficulty (operationalised as actual and perceived
difficulty to memorise or copy the sequences). As they
found strong correlations between measures of encoding
difficulty and judgments of randomness across sequence
alternation rate they concluded that people use a subjective
measure of sequence complexity as a proxy for determining
sequence randomness.

Is judgment always poor?
The bias towards perceiving high alternation rate sequences
as random suggests a consistent but flawed human
understanding of randomness. However, other research has
found that certain experimental conditions can alter this
bias, indicating that there is not a consistent biased view of
randomness. Wiegersma (1982) found that when he asked
participants to produce a random sequence using music
tones there was less bias than in a conventional generation
task. He also found that altering the physical presentation of
the symbols, such as changing the font or changing the
spacing, impacted on the degree of bias (1987).
Additionally, Lopes and Oden (1987) found that if they
gave people information about the properties of the
hypothetical machines causing the sequences that people
were better able to identify the random sequences.
Furthermore, research into the role of causal belief on
gambler‟s fallacy behaviour suggests that knowledge of the
mechanism producing the sequence can influence our
judgments about its randomness. Studies by Ayton and
Fischer (2004), and Burns and Corpus (2004) looking at the
gambler‟s fallacy found that people‟s belief about the cause
of the sequence affects when they are likely to follow the
gambler‟s fallacy and when they are likely to follow its
converse, the hot hand belief. The hot hand belief originated
in basketball and describes the belief that a run of one
outcome (e.g. making shots in basketball) will continue.
Burns and Corpus found that beliefs about the randomness
of the generating mechanism influenced whether people
predict a short run of the same outcome would continue or
end. When the causal mechanism was perceived to be
random, such as a roulette wheel, people were more likely
to end a run than when they perceived the cause to be nonrandom, such as a basketball player (see also Ayton &
Fischer).
The inference from these studies is that knowledge of the
cause of a sequence can influence our interpretation of its
randomness. Thus the instructions given to participants in
perception of randomness tasks might also influence the
judgments participants make.

The role of instruction
In their studies on perceived randomness, Wagenaar (1970a)
and Falk and Konold (1997), gave participants the example
of a coin toss to aid explanation of the concept of
randomness. In her earlier study Falk (1981) used colored
cards and asked participants how “well shuffled” (p. 225)
the cards were. Wiegersma (1982) also used the example of
a coin toss for his conventional perception of randomness
task, but used the example of a roulette wheel for his
random music tone generation task. In their judgment task
Lopes and Oden (1987) refer to sequences produced by
various machines with different process properties. Thus it
appears that in studies of perceived randomness, some type
of causal „agent‟ or mechanism is mentioned and in many
cases it is a coin being tossed.

The coin toss example was introduced to make the task
clearer for participants and presumably because, as a coin
toss is known to be random, it should not influence people‟s
judgments about randomness. Is it possible however that
people do not believe coin tossing is really random? Roney
and Trick (2003) found that people believe there is
interconnectedness between successive coin tosses. In their
study, people predicted a series of coin toss outcomes while
getting feedback. They found that participants committed
the gambler‟s fallacy except when they were told a new
block of tosses was starting. Gambler‟s fallacy behavior is
only sensible when you believe there is interconnectedness
between outcomes, which mention of the new block broke.
Clearly, whenever people follow the gambler‟s fallacy, they
are behaving as if a coin toss is not random. As apparently
all previous perception of randomness studies have used an
example such as a coin toss, it is possible that the bias in
randomness judgments is due to the coin example and not
due to an innate bias in our understanding of randomness.
A well cited study by Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky
(1985) on the hot hand belief had participants judge the
randomness of sequences that were nominally created by
basketball players. They asked participants to rate sequences
with different alternation rates as chance, streak or alternate
shooting and found that sequences with alternation rates of
around 0.7-0.8 were judged as typical of a chance sequence.
It has been suggested by Gilovich and colleagues that
people believe in the hot hand effect because they do not
believe that basketball shots are independent events. This is
similar to believing that successive coin tosses are
interconnected and thus it is interesting that a similar bias is
found when the sequence cause is a basketball player. It is
possible that introducing a causal agent, regardless of the
type of cause, reduces beliefs about outcome independence,
thus resulting in a biased assessment of randomness.

Current experiment
The current experiment directly assesses the role of causal
agent on judgments of randomness by comparing the
perceived randomness (PR) ratings of people given a causal
belief with those given none. Falk and Konold (1997)
proposed that randomness judgments are influenced by
perceptions of sequence complexity, operationalised as
encoding or memorisability difficulty. They presumed that
the bias in people‟s judgments of randomness is due to an
innate misunderstanding of randomness and sought to find
the underlying mechanism. They took the strong
correlations they found between various measures of
encoding difficulty and measures of perceived randomness
as evidence for their theory that judgments of randomness
are influenced by perceptions of sequence complexity. If
judgments of randomness are biased due to belief examples
such as a coin toss and not encoding difficulty, then
difficulty of encoding may not correlate with perceptions of
randomness when no causal belief is given. So in addition,
one measure of encoding difficulty, perceived difficulty to
memorise (PM) the sequences, was also explored.

1582

In this experiment, sets of sequences with various
alternation rates were presented to participants who rated
the perceived randomness or perceived memorisability of
each sequence. To investigate the role of causal belief on
these judgments participants were given either no causal
belief or one of two causal beliefs. The two causal beliefs
used were a coin being tossed and a basketball player taking
free throws. It was expected that as causal beliefs reduce
beliefs about the independence of outcomes, they would
influence perceptions of randomness. In particular, when no
belief is given, the highest randomness ratings would be
given for sequences with alternation rates close to the ideal
0.5, whereas when a causal belief is given the highest
randomness ratings would be for sequences with higher
alternation rates.
It was expected that when no causal belief was given
there would be no correlation between PR and PM ratings.
In addition, perceived memorisability scores would not be
influenced by causal belief as the ratings should be
influenced only by the sequence structure. In keeping with
the findings of Falk and Konold (1997) it was expected that
sequences judged to be most difficult to memorise would be
those with alternation rates around 0.6 to 0.7.

Method
Participants
Second year students (N = 241, mean age = 20.7 years, SD =
2.7) from UNSW took part in the experiment as part of a
class activity. Different tutorial groups were assigned to
each of the six experimental conditions (n = 35 to 46).

Stimuli
The sequences shown to participants were generated using
the random number generator in Microsoft Excel and
sequences with the required alternation rates were selected.
As well as controlling for alternation rate, sequences were
selected with approximately even numbers of each outcome.
These sequences were then converted to @ and # symbols.
Figure 1 provides examples of sequences used for three of
the alternation rates.

Figure 1: Examples of sequences used with alternation
rates of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8.
There were six sequences for each of the seven alternation
rates (0.2 to 0.8) resulting in a total of 42 sequences.
Sequences were presented in blocks of seven with one
example of each alternation rate in each block. The
sequences were chosen and ordered randomly. Each
sequence was used once for each participant.

Procedure
Participants read instructions appropriate for their condition
and then rated six sets of seven sequences. The instructions
were kept as similar as possible but the middle section was
modified for the three belief conditions. The instructions for
the memorisability task are consistent with those used by
Falk and Konold (1997). The section below highlights the
differences in instructions.
Perceived randomness (PR) conditions:
Everyone:
The aim of this experiment is to find out how random
sequences appear to people.
Control condition:
You are about to see some sequences of @ and #
symbols. You need to rate how random you think each
sequence is on a scale from 1 to 7. A random sequence is
one governed by chance in which each outcome is
independent of the one before it.
Coin toss condition:
When a coin is tossed you get a sequence of head and tail
outcomes. You are about to see some sequences of @ and
# symbols that were created by tossing a coin. You need
to rate how random you think each sequence is on a scale
from 1 to 7. A random sequence is one governed by
chance in which each outcome is independent of the one
before it, thus all of these coin toss sequences can be
considered to be equally random; however we are
interested in how random they appear to you.
Basketball condition:
In the game of basketball people make free throws, which
are attempts to shoot a goal. This creates a sequence of
hits and misses. You are about to see some sequences of
@ and # symbols that were created by people making free
throws in basketball. You need to rate how random you
think each sequence is on a scale from 1 to 7. A random
sequence is one governed by chance in which each
outcome is independent of the one before it.
Everyone:
Please look at all the sequences first then assign a 7 to the
sequence or sequences that appear most random to you
and a 1 to the sequence or sequences that appear least
random to you. You need to use the rating 1 and 7 at least
once per page. Use the remaining numbers (2-6) to rate
the rest of the sequences.
Perceived memorisation (PM) condition:
Everyone:
The aim of this experiment is to find out how people rate
their ability to memorise information.
Control condition:
You are about to see some sequences of @ and #
symbols.

1583

p <.05, η2=.04. This interaction indicates that people given a
causal belief rate sequences with higher alternation rates as
more random compared to those not given a causal belief
(control).

Coin toss condition:
When a coin is tossed you get a sequence of head and tail
outcomes. You are about to see some sequences of @ and
# symbols that were created by tossing a coin.
Basketball condition:
In the game of basketball people make free throws, which
are attempts to shoot a goal. This creates a sequence of
hits and misses. You are about to see some sequences of
@ and # symbols that were created by people making free
throws in basketball.
Everyone:
You need to rate how difficult you think it would be to
memorise each sequence on a scale from 1 (not at all
difficult) to 7 (extremely difficult). Imagine that you have
to memorise each sequence and then reproduce it on a
piece of paper without looking at the computer screen.
The difficulty of memorising might be affected by things
like how easy it would be to divide the sequence in to
memorable „chunks‟ or the presence of patterns in the
sequence. Please look at all the sequences first then assign
a 7 to the sequence or sequences that appear most difficult
to memorise and a 1 to the sequence or sequences that
appear least difficult to memorise. You need to use the
rating 1 and 7 at least once per page. Use the remaining
numbers (2-6) to rate the rest of the sequences.

Perceived Memorisability

Participants then rated the sequences as per the
instructions. While participants were forced to use the
extremes of the scale they were free in their use of the other
ratings. Thus the ratings are not strictly ordinal.

Results
Each participant‟s average rating for each alternation rate
was calculated. Consistent with Falk and Konold (1997)
average group ratings were calculated and normalized (0 to
1). These group ratings are presented separately for the two
tasks in Figures 2 and 3. (Note: No bar is visible when the
rating is 0.)
The results for both tasks were analysed using ANOVAs.
In both analyses there are several significant main effects
for alternation rate, so for each analysis only the largest
effect is reported.
As expected, both tasks had significant main effects for
alternation rate, PR (quadratic): F(1,115) = 81.32, p <.05, η2
= .41; PM (linear): F(1,120) = 749.84, p <.05, η2 = .86.
There were no main effects for belief for either task which
was expected as the belief manipulation was between
participants and the same range of ratings was used for each
belief. For the PM task there was no significant interaction
between belief and alternation rate, F(2, 120) = 1.81, p =.17,
indicating that the belief manipulation had no effect on
ratings of perceived randomness. For the PR task a
difference was expected between the two belief conditions
and the control condition. Therefore the results from the two
belief conditions were combined and compared against the
control condition. A small but significant interaction was
found between belief and alternation rate, F(1, 116) = 4.33,

Taken together these results indicate that the pattern of
results is different for the two tasks and that there are small
effects for belief only in the PR task. Earlier research into
perceived randomness concluded that people are biased
towards seeing higher alternation rate sequences as more
random than the mathematically random 0.5 alternation rate
sequences. That is, earlier research has found that the peak
randomness rating by participants was for sequences with
alternation rates above 0.5. To explore the role of belief
within each task further, peak PR and peak PM values were
calculated.
For each participant a quadratic curve was fitted to their
rating data allowing the alternation rate with the peak rating

1584

to be calculated. Thirteen participants from the PR task were
excluded as it was not possible to fit a curve to their data
and thus no peak perceived randomness could be calculated
For the PM task only one participant was excluded. For
each belief and task the peak ratings were compared against
a value of 0.5 using a single sample t-test. The value of 0.5
was selected as it should be the peak if ratings were based
on the mathematically correct value. Results from this
analysis are presented in Table 1 below. These results show
that for all conditions except the control PR group, the peak
rating was above 0.5.

Falk and Konold (1997) found correlations between
various encoding measures and the randomness ratings,
suggesting that when judging randomness people rate the
sequences based on encoding difficulty. In the current study
correlations between PR and PM were calculated using the
group averages. Strong and significant correlations were
found between PR and PM for the conditions with causal
beliefs (coin toss: r2=.981, p=.000; basketball: r2=.885,
p=.008) but no significant correlation was found for the
control condition (r2=.534, p=.217). The differences in the
correlations are due to the effect of causal belief on PR.
Causal belief influences PR ratings but not PM ratings, so it
is not possible for PR and PM to correlate for all beliefs.

Discussion
Peoples‟ inability to accurately select the appropriate
sequence as the most random has been used as evidence of
our poor understanding of randomness (Falk, 1981; Falk &
Konold, 1997; Wagenaar, 1972). The results from the PR
task reported here suggest that when not influenced by
causal information people are able to accurately select the
most random sequence. This contrasts with instances where
a causal belief is given, where perceptions of randomness
are biased towards judging sequences with higher
alternation rates as more random. The results are generally
consistent with previous research, as studies that found
randomness ratings biased towards higher alternation rates
have involved causal agents (Falk, 1981; Falk & Konold,
1997; Wagenaar, 1970a). However, the results from the
control condition, finding no bias, lead to a different
interpretation, namely that under certain conditions people
are able to accurately judge the randomness of a sequence.

The results show that causal belief does influence
perceptions of randomness by shifting the peak randomness
rating to higher alternation rate sequences.
The results of the present study contrast with those of
Ayton and Fischer (2004), and Burns and Corpus (2004)
who found that the type of causal belief influences
judgments. That is the animacy (Ayton & Fischer) or the
perceived randomness (Burns & Corpus) of the belief was
crucial in determining people‟s assessment of the sequence.
The current experiment compared belief with no belief and
found that belief, regardless of the type, results in a bias in
judgments of randomness.
While causal belief influences perceptions of randomness
it appears to have no effect on perceptions of
memorisability. Falk and Konold (1997) suggested that
encoding difficulty may be used as a proxy in rating the
randomness of a sequence. In this experiment we have
operationalised encoding difficulty as perceived difficulty to
memorise the sequence. When no belief was given there is
no correlation between PR and PM, suggesting that ratings
of memorisability or encoding difficulty are not directly
influencing ratings of randomness. In the two experiments
where Falk and Konold measured perceived memorisability
they do not appear to have mentioned a causal agent as part
of the instructions. Despite manipulating causal belief, the
PM task results reported here are consistent with those
found by Falk and Konold, showing a bias towards judging
higher alternation rate sequences as harder to memorise. As
belief has no effect on PM ratings, it appears that
participants are focused on the sequence structure.
The high correlation between randomness rating and
difficulty of encoding task found by Falk and Konold
(1997) are replicated in the coin toss condition, while the
correlation in the basketball condition exists but is slightly
weaker. This occurs because the coin toss and basketball PR
results are biased towards high alternation rates. For the
control condition there is no bias in the PR task but still a
bias in the PM task so the correlation is weak and not
significant.
The PR task appears susceptible to manipulation of
experimental variables. For example, Wiegersma (1987)
was able to reduce the bias in a perception task by varying
the font and symbol spacing. In the current study the causal
beliefs seem to have created the impression that the
individual outcomes are not independent. While this is not
unusual for the basketball belief it is unexpected for the coin
toss belief. However, Roney and Trick (2003) have
previously demonstrated that people do hold faulty beliefs
about the interconnectedness of consecutive outcomes of
coin tosses. A similar design as that used by Roney and
Trick, where interconnectedness is manipulated, could be
used
to test
whether
reducing the apparent
interconnectedness of outcomes would reduce the effect of a
causal belief on judgments of randomness.
The finding from the current study, that people are not
biased in their understanding of randomness, appears at
odds with the overwhelming prevalence of the gambler‟s

1585

fallacy in everyday life. It is important to note however, that
when the gambler‟s fallacy is observed there is always a
known cause for the sequence. It is possible that the
gambler‟s fallacy could be reduced if people made
predictions of future outcomes without knowing the cause
of the sequence.
This study has not explored the role of causal belief in
generation of random sequences. At least some previous
studies have included the coin toss example to guide
participants in their concept of randomness (e.g. Kareev,
1992; Rapoport & Budescu, 1992). Budescu and Rapoport
(1992; 1994) found that under game conditions, and when
no causal belief was given, people produced less biased
sequences than when asked to produce random sequences
with a coin toss (1992) or a die (1994) as examples. It
would be worthwhile to separate the belief instruction from
the task type to see whether just asking participants to
produce a random sequence without mentioning a causal
agent is sufficient to reduce the bias in generation of
sequences. However, generation and judgment may still be
distinct tasks involving different processes and perhaps the
process of generation encourages people to construct
interconnectedness between outcomes. Alternatively, people
may be limited in their ability due to attention or capacity
restrictions as suggested elsewhere (Falk & Konold, 1997;
Wagenaar, 1970a).
The results presented provide a new mindset from which
to view previous findings and the oft stated comment that
people have a poor understanding of randomness. It appears
that when not influenced by causal information we are able
to accurately perceive randomness. However, when a causal
agent is present, as is the case in most everyday situations,
interconnectedness between outcomes is perceived,
resulting in biased judgments. No support was found for the
suggestion by Falk & Konold (1997) that judgments of
randomness are directed by perceptions of sequence
complexity.
