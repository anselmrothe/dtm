Abstract
Is income inequality more of a blemish or a failing organ in
our economy? Both metaphors capture something about
wealth disparities, but only failing organ seems to emphasize
the fact that our economy is a complex system where activity
in one region may lead to a cascade of problems in other parts
of the system. In the present study, we introduce a novel
method for classifying such “systemic” metaphors, which
reveals that people can reliably identify the extent to which a
metaphor highlights the complex causal structure of a target
domain. In a second experiment, we asked whether exposing
people to more systemic metaphors would induce a systems
thinking mindset and influence reasoning on a seemingly
unrelated task. We found that participants who were primed
with systemic metaphors scored higher on subsequent tasks
that measured relational and holistic thinking, supporting the
view that these metaphors can promote systems thinking.

Introduction
The greatest challenges humans currently face – climate
change, poverty, epidemics, financial meltdowns – involve
enormously complex systems. To facilitate effective
decision making in these critical areas, scholars from
diverse fields have emphasized a need to promote a systems
thinking mindset among policy experts and the lay public
(e.g., Checkland, 1972; Davis & Stroink, 2015; Maani &
Maharaj, 2004; Richmond, 1993; Rozenblit & Keil, 2002).
There are three core components of systems thinking.
First, it requires people to move away from reductionist
modes of inquiry (explaining a system in terms of the
behavior of individual components) and towards holistic
modes of thinking (explaining a system in terms of the
dynamic interrelationships between constituent elements;
e.g., Richmond, 1993). Second, it requires a broader
conception of causality because outcomes in systems are
determined by a complex set of frequently non-linear, direct
and indirect causes (e.g., Capra, 1985). And third, it requires
an appreciation that systems are in constant, but patterned,
flux (e.g., Sweeny & Sterman, 2007). Here, we offer
theoretical and empirical support for designing metaphorbased interventions to promote systems thinking.
Metaphors are powerful tools for conceptual and
behavioral change (Dweck, 2006; Hauser & Schwarz, 2014;

Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Landau, Sullivan, & Greenberg,
2009; Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2011; 2013). Hauser and
Schwarz (2014), for instance, have found that describing
cancer using war metaphors, as an enemy that must be
fought, increases general support for cancer research but
decreases individual propensities to engage in healthy
preventative behaviors. Dweck (2006) has similarly shown
that metaphor-based interventions can fundamentally
change children’s epistemic beliefs. By comparing the brain
to a muscle, she and her colleagues induced a growth
mindset for intelligence, which led students to engage more
deeply and deliberately in their coursework.
Metaphors influence our thought most strongly in areas
where direct experiential or perceptual knowledge is
limited, as is the case with complex systems. Many scholars
have argued that the concept of time, for instance, requires
metaphoric thinking – a reliance on our conception of space
– because we cannot experience time in a direct and tangible
way (e.g., Boroditsky, Fuhrman, & McCormick, 2010;
Clark, 1973; Traugott, 1978). Although people have some
direct experience with complex systems like the
environment and the economy, the full scope and dynamics
of systems cannot be experienced all at once and are
difficult to conceptualize on their own.
Implicit in several findings on the role of metaphor in
reasoning is an appeal to a distinct class of systemic
metaphors that invite people to build a richer, more nuanced
representation of the target domain that includes multiple
causal entailments. Consider the complex domain of crime.
Thibodeau and Boroditsky (2011; 2013) found that
describing crime as a beast led people to support direct
crime-fighting measures like hiring more police officers.
Framing crime as a virus, on the other hand, led to support
for reform-based measures like increasing education and
investigating the origins of crime in the community. One
way of characterizing the difference between virus and
beast metaphors for crime is that the virus metaphor invites
people to build a deeper causal structure of the problem, so
people think more about the root causes of crime and try to
address them (i.e. the virus metaphor is more systemic).
In this paper we first describe a method for identifying the
degree to which metaphors are systemic (Experiment 1).
This dimension is similar to a distinction that is commonly
made in the analogy literature between attributional (e.g.,

2362

“The sun is an orange”) and relational (e.g., “The atom is a
solar system”) comparison (Gentner, 1983; Lakoff, 2002;
Wolff & Gentner, 2011). Relational analogies and
metaphors highlight complex structural relationships (e.g., a
national park is the backbone of the park system because it
provides support and structure to the whole system, without
which the system would not function properly) whereas
attributional analogies and metaphors focus on relatively
superficial, feature-level correspondences between domains
(e.g., a national park is the pearl of the park system since it
is particularly beautiful).
In a second experiment, we exposed participants to more
or less systemic metaphors (based on results from
Experiment 1) before they completed a set of tasks that have
been used to measure holistic (Maddux & Yuki, 2006) and
relational reasoning (Rottman, Gentner, & Goldwater,
2012). We predicted that exposing people to systemic
metaphors would help induce a systems thinking mindset
that would transfer to seemingly unrelated tasks, thus
leading to enhanced holistic and relational reasoning.

metaphors were used to describe the educational system: the
more systemic frame compared education to a garden, while
the less systemic frame compared education to a flower.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of six
between-subjects metaphor conditions in this experiment,
and completed a set of three tasks for just one of the
metaphors described above.
First, participants were presented with one of the six
metaphors and were asked to provide an interpretation. For
instance, “How is income inequality like a failing organ?”
Next, they were asked to rate the metaphor using an
adapted version of Davis and Stroink’s (2015) Systems
Thinking Scale. There were six items on this scale that
asked people to rate the extent to which, for instance,
talking about income inequality as a failing organ captures
the idea that…
1. …everything in the universe is somehow related to each
other.
2. …nothing is unrelated.
3. …everything in the world is intertwined in a causal
relationship.
4. …even a small change in any element of the universe
can have significant consequences.
5. …any phenomenon has numerous causes, although
some of the causes are not known.
6. …any phenomenon entails numerous consequences,
although some of them may not be known.

Experiment 1
Methods
Participants We recruited and paid 600 participants
through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. We used Turk’s
exclusion capabilities to ensure that participants lived in the
US and had a good performance record on pervious tasks.
At the end of the survey participants were given a random
completion code. Data from 18 participants were excluded
because they did not provide an accurate completion code,
leaving data from 582 participants for analysis.
This sample included an equal number of males (50%) as
females. The average age of participants was 32.8 (sd =
11.46). Most (84%) had completed at least some college.
The political affiliation of participants was skewed liberal,
with 43%, 43% and 14% identifying as Democrat,
Independent, and Republican, respectively.
Materials & Procedure We created three pairs of
metaphors in which one was thought to be more systemic
than the other (based on author intuitions and prior
research). Each pair was used to frame one of three
important socio-political domains: crime, education, and the
economy.
To control for the valence, arousal, and additional
linguistic associations of the metaphors, each pair of
metaphors was developed from the same source domain. For
instance, the two metaphors that were used to describe the
economy both represented the financial system as a body.
One, however, focused on a relatively superficial and
isolated feature of a body by comparing income inequality
to a blemish. The other highlighted the body as a holistic
system by comparing income inequality to a failing organ.
Body-related metaphors were also used to describe crime:
the more systemic frame compared crime to a virus; the less
systemic frame compared crime to a broken bone. Plant

Participants indicated their response using a five-point
Likert scale that ranged from, 1, “Strongly Disagree”, to 5,
“Strongly Agree”.
For the first two tasks, participants only saw one
metaphor for a given issue. In the third task, they were
presented with both metaphors for that issue at the same
time (e.g., income inequality can be described as a blemish
or a failing organ). They were then asked to make five
judgments about the pair of metaphors:
1. Which seems to situate the issue in broader context?
2. Which seems to make the issue seem more complex?
3. Which seems to make the issue seem more simple?
4. Which seems to make the issue seem more involved –
something you can really influence and change?
5. Which do you find more appropriate?
After completing these three tasks, participants completed
Davis and Stroink’s (2015) Systems Thinking Scale, a 15item questionnaire designed to measure “the tendency to
perceive and understand relevant phenomena as emergent
from complex, dynamic, and nested systems.” Then they
were asked a set of background demographic questions
including their age, sex, first language, educational
background, geographic location, and political affiliation.

Results and Discussion
Metaphor Interpretations We used the Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count software (LIWC; Pennebaker, Chung,
Ireland, Gonzales, & Booth, 2007) to analyze participants’
interpretations of the metaphors. We predicted that people
would write longer and more intricate interpretations for the
metaphors that we considered relatively systemic. We also
predicted that people who were high in systems thinking
would write longer and more intricate interpretations.
Accordingly, we fit an ANCOVA with main effects for
issue, metaphor type (systemic or not), and systems
thinking. We also included an interaction term between
metaphor type and systems thinking.
We found a significant main effect for issue, F[2, 574]=
10.439, p<.001: people wrote more about the economy (M =
33.55, sd=31.49) than crime, t[296.79; variances not
assumed to be equal]=3.29, p=.001, (M=24.30, sd=21.59) or
education, t[264.81] = 3.94, p<.001, (M=22.92, sd=17.73).
There was no difference between the crime and education
stories in terms of length, t[398.57]=.71, p=.481.
In addition, we found a significant main effect of systems
thinking, F[1, 576]=9.673, p=.002. People who were higher
in systems thinking wrote more, B=.774, SE=.219, p<.001.
We also found an interaction between systems thinking and
metaphor type, F[1, 574]=4.4390, p=.037. In general,
people wrote more in response to systemic metaphors
(M=27.33, sd=23.51 compared to nonsystemic metaphors
M=25.74, sd=25.21), B=43.31, SE=20.08, p=.031. At the
same time, however, people who were high in systems
thinking wrote slightly less about systemic metaphors than
people who were low in systems thinking, B=-.619, SE=295,
p=.036. In other words, people who were high in systems
thinking wrote longer responses regardless of metaphor
type, but people who were lower in systems thinking wrote
more in response to systemic metaphors. There was no
interaction between issue and metaphor type, F[2,
574]=.070, p=.932.
Ratings of Systemic-ness We fit the ratings data to an
ANCOVA with the same terms for main effects and
interactions (i.e. main effects for issue, metaphor type, and
systems thinking; interactions between issue, metaphor type,
and systems thinking). In this case, we found main effects of
issue, (F[2, 574]=3.28, p=.038), systems thinking (F[1,
574]= 15.538, p<.001), and metaphor type (F[1,
574]=5.331, p=.021). People considered the economy
(M=21.36, sd=4.56) to be more systemic than crime
(M=20.16, sd=4.56) or education (M=20.27, sd=4.77),
t[381.323; variances not assumed to be equal]=2.25, p=.017
and t[367.44] = 2.25, p = .025, respectively. There was no
difference in ratings between crime and education, t[405.31]
=.22, p=.824.
People who were higher in systems thinking considered
the metaphors more systemic overall, B=0.116, SE=.030,
p<.001, and systemic metaphors were rated as more
systemic (M=20.99, sd=4.88, compared to nonsystemic
metaphors, M=20.05, sd=4.92), t[565.45]=2.304, p=.022.

There were no interactions between systems thinking and
metaphor type, F[1, 574]=1.643, p=.200, or between story
and metaphor type, F[2, 574]=1.977, p=.140.
Metaphor Comparison Participants viewed the systemic
metaphors as situating the target problems in a broader
context, χ2[1]=208.08, p<.001, as more complex,
χ2[1]=220.21, p<.001, and as less simple χ2[1]=163.00,
p<.001. They also thought that the systemic metaphors
made the target problems seem more involved but tractable,
χ2[1]=43.99, p<.001, and more appropriate, χ2[1]=165.12,
p<.001 (see Table 1).

metaphor as a better answer to the five comparison questions.

The results of Experiment 1 suggest that metaphors can
be quantified in terms of the degree to which they highlight
systems. As predicted, people wrote more in response to
systemic metaphors, rated them as more systemic, and
viewed them as more systemic in a comparison task.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 2 we tested whether exposing people to a pair
of systemic metaphors could induce a systems thinking
mindset. There were four between-subjects conditions in the
metaphor exposure task: people read one of two types of
metaphors (systemic or not) and made one of two kinds of
judgments about the domains that the metaphors framed (an
evaluation or an explanation). Half of the participants were
asked to rate the degree to which a policy proposal would
address the target problem, while the other half were asked
to explain how and why a policy would address the target
problem.
The policy proposals were designed to be consistent with
the distinction between the metaphor frames. After reading a
more systemic metaphor, people were asked to evaluate or
explain a more systemic intervention; after reading a less
systemic metaphor, people were asked to evaluate or
explain a less systemic intervention. For instance, people in
the more systemic condition were asked whether “reforming
educational programs” would be likely to reduce a crime
virus. In contrast people in the less systemic condition were
asked whether “increasing street patrols” would be likely to
reduce crime when it was framed as a broken bone.
We chose to pair policies with matching metaphors (i.e.
relatively systemic policies with relatively systemic
metaphors and less systemic policies with less systemic

2364

metaphors) to facilitate the influence of the metaphor
frames. For instance, evaluating a systemic policy (e.g.,
reforming educational practices) after reading a less
systemic metaphor might disrupt the mindset induced by the
metaphor frame1.
After completing the metaphor exposure task, participants
completed two follow-up tasks that were designed to
measure their tendency to engage in systems thinking. As
the conceptual foundation of systems thinking relates to
constructs like holistic thinking and relational thinking, one
of the follow-up tasks was adapted from studies of holistic
thinking (Maddux & Yuki, 2006) and the other was adapted
from studies of relational thinking (Rottman, Gentner, &
Goldwater, 2012).
Our hypothesis was that people who were exposed to
systemic metaphors would be more likely to show patterns
of behavior consistent with holistic and relational thinking.
We also predicted that the effect might be strongest in the
explanation conditions, as these conditions would seem to
require that participants think more deeply about the target
domains.

Method
Participants We recruited and paid 450 people through
Mechanical Turk, using the same exclusion criteria as in
Experiment 1. Data from 42 participants were excluded
because they either did not provide an accurate completion
code or because they had also participated in Experiment 1.
There were slightly fewer male participants (39%) than
female. The average age of participants was 36.47 (sd =
12.99). Most (86%) had completed at least some college.
The political ideology of the participants was skewed
slightly liberal: 38%, 32% and 22% identified as a
Democrat, Independent, Republican, respectively; 9%
identified as “other”.
In line with prior work on relational reasoning (Rottman,
Gentner, & Goldwater, 2012), we asked participants to
report their level of mathematical and scientific training on
a 4-point scale: 6%, 37%, 45%, and 11% of participants
identified as having no background, not much background,
some background, and a lot of background in math and
science, respectively. The sample also included participants
with a range of scores on the Systems Thinking Scale (M =
68.14, sd = 6.95; median = 68).

Materials and Design Before completing the experimental
tasks, participants completed the Systems Thinking Scale
(Davis & Stroink, 2015). This measure was presented at the
beginning of the study so that the manipulation would not
influence participants’ responses on the scale.
Then participants completed a metaphor exposure task.
They read two metaphors that did or did not emphasize a
holistic system. We used the crime and economy metaphors
from Experiment 1 because they showed a clear dichotomy
on the systemic dimension and because both conceptualized
the target domain as a body. In the more systemic condition,
participants read reports that framed crime as a virus and
income inequality as a failing organ. In the less systemic
condition, participants read reports that framed crime as a
broken bone and income inequality as a blemish.
Next, participants were presented with a policy
intervention for each issue. The policies, like the metaphors,
were designed to differ in the degree to which they
emphasized a system. People in the systemic condition were
presented with systemic policies (for crime: reforming
educational practices; for income inequality: forgiving
student loan debt). People the non-systemic condition were
presented with less systemic policies (for crime: increasing
street patrols that look for criminals; for income inequality:
raising the minimum wage).
Half of the participants evaluated the policy proposals on
a 5-point Likert scale (1 = “Very unlikely to improve the
{crime / income inequality} situation”; 5 = “Very likely”).
The other half of participants were asked to describe “why
this course of action is likely to improve the crime / income
equality situation.”
After completing the metaphor task, participants
completed measures of holistic and relational thinking
(randomly ordered across participants). As a measure of
holistic thinking (Maddux & Yuki, 2006), people read a
story about a student who had caused an accident on the
freeway and evaluated the student’s responsibility for five
outcomes. The outcomes were increasingly distally related
to the accident, rated on a 4-point scale that ranged from
“Not responsible at all” to “Completely responsible.” These
questions read:
If you were the student, how responsible would you feel
for…
1. …damaging your own car.
2. …the driver you hit.
3. …missing a meeting that you were rushing to attend.
4. …delaying other commuters in traffic.
5. …causing an accident that occurred further back in
traffic.

There is, however, a drawback to this method in that it introduces
another variable into the design: if people in the systemic condition
show an increased propensity to engage in relational reasoning, it
may be because they read two systemic metaphors or it may be
because they thought about two systemic policy approaches. In
future work, we plan to include additional conditions in which the
policies are incongruent with the metaphor frames (i.e. some
people evaluate a less systemic policy approach to a systemic
framing of the issues and vice versa). As this represents a novel
exploration in cognitive science, we designed the experiment to
maximize our chances of seeing an effect.

Prior work has shown that people attribute less
responsibility to the student as the outcomes become more
distally related to the accident. However, holistic thinkers
have been shown to be more likely to attribute responsibility
to the student for distally related outcomes (Maddux &
Yuki, 2006).

2365

As a measure of relational thinking, participants read and
made judgments about verbal descriptions of causal systems
(Rottman, Gentner, & Goldwater, 2012). In the original
version of this task, participants were given descriptions of
25 systems – five particular kinds of causal systems from
five target domains – and asked to sort them into groups. It
was found that participants with a scientific background
were more likely to categorize the descriptions by causal
structure than content domain.
We adapted this study so that it could be more easily
included in a web-based experiment by making it a “match
to sample” task. The “sample” described a particular kind of
system (e.g., positive feedback loop, negative feedback
loop, causal chain) in a target domain (environmental,
economic, biological). There were two potential matches:
one that described a similar causal system and one that
described a similar content domain. There were five trials of
this task, presented in a randomized order.
After completing the three experimental tasks,
participants were asked their sex, first language, educational
history, “general math and science ability,” geographic
location, and political affiliation.

Results and Discussion
Holistic Thinking Ratings of responsibility for outcomes
related to the car accident were subjected to a repeatedmeasures ANCOVA with condition (systemic or not) and
task (evaluation or generation) as between-subjects
predictors, and outcome (coded continuously from most
proximal to most distal) as a within-subjects predictor. We
also included systems thinking as a covariate.

Relational Thinking Two analyses revealed the effect of
metaphors on relational thinking. In the first, participants
were characterized as relational thinkers if at least four (out
of five) of their responses matched the causal structure of
the sample description. A logistic regression with predictors
for metaphor type (systemic or not), initial task (evaluation
or generation), and scientific/mathematical background was
fit to the data. The model revealed significant effects of
metaphor type, B = .916, SE = .381, p = .016, and
mathematical training, B = .507, SE = .191, p = .008. It did
not reveal an effect of the initial task or an interaction
between metaphor type and the initial task, ps > .2. People
who read the systemic metaphors were more likely to judge
similarity on the basis of causal structure, as were people
with more mathematical training.

There were also no main effects of condition or task, nor

to attribute blame to the student overall (i.e. for all of the
outcomes), B = .041, SE = .006, p < .001. However, as the
outcomes became more distally related to the accident
systems thinkers attributed less blame to the student, B = .005, SE = .001, p < .001. This interaction came as a
surprise to us and warrants further research.

In a second analysis, individual responses on the
relational thinking task were subjected to a repeated
measures logistic regression. Predictors for this model
included metaphor type (systemic or not), initial task
(evaluation or generation), and scientific or mathematical
training, as well as an interaction between metaphor type
and initial task. Here, too, we found a main effect of
metaphor type, B = .278, SE = .140, p = .048 (see Figure 2).
People exposed to the systemic metaphors were more likely
to match descriptions that described similar causal systems.
In this case there was a marginal main effect of
mathematical training, B = .110, SE = .066, p = .097. There
was no main effect of initial task or interaction between
initial task and metaphor type, ps > .2.

General Discussion
This study offers three important advances in research on
the relationship between metaphor and thought. First, it
identifies a dimension of metaphors that has been
underappreciated in previous work on metaphor framing: a
distinction between metaphors that highlight the dynamic
nature of complex systems and metaphors that highlight
relatively superficial features of systems (i.e. a distinction
between metaphors that emphasize the complexity of target
domains versus metaphors that simplify target domains).
Second, we have presented a method for operationalizing
and quantifying this dimension for metaphors. We found
that, as predicted, people wrote longer and more intricate
descriptions in response to systemic metaphors, that they
explicitly rated these metaphors as more systemic, and that
they viewed systemic metaphors as more complex in a
comparison task.
Third, we have found support for the hypothesis that
exposing people to systemic metaphors can induce a
transferable systems thinking mindset. People who were
exposed to two highly systemic metaphors showed higher
levels of holistic and relational reasoning than people who
were exposed to two less systemic metaphors.
In addition to these important theoretical advances, this
work has promising practical value. Metaphors are simple
and scalable tools for increasing systems thinking and
enhancing decision-making: tools that may help people
approach some of the most difficult and complex problems
that we face today.
