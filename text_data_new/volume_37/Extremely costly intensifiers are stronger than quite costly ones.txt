Abstract

because theoretical considerations, which we lay out shortly,
suggest a relationship between their meaning and their usage
cost (e.g., due to frequency and length).
In the next section we start from the model presented
by Lassiter and Goodman (2013) to explain the meaning of
scalar adjectives, like tall and expensive. This probabilistic
Rational Speech Acts (Frank & Goodman, 2012; Goodman
& Stuhlmüller, 2013) model describes how a threshold on
meaning (e.g. the minimum price that counts as an expensive watch) can be established by pragmatic inference that
takes into account statistical background knowledge (such as
the distribution of prices for watches). We explore the effect of having multiple versions of the adjective that have the
same meaning but different costs, and find a M(arkedness)implicature (Levinson, 2000): more marked (costly to utter)
versions will be interpreted as implicating higher values. This
motivates the hypothesis that a major portion of the meaning of intensifiers comes from this process rather than from
conventionally associated meanings. Concretely, this predicts
that the meanings of intensifiers are influenced by their form
(in length) and their distribution (frequency) of usage. The
impact of word length is reminiscent of the results of Lewis
et al. (2014), who studied noun categories. While word frequency is known to have major effects on sentence processing
(Levy, 2008, e.g.), the prediction that frequency should affect
meaning is more novel.
We confirm, in two experiments, that English intensifiers in
adjective phrases are indeed interpreted as much higher degrees (e.g. in the case of expensive, higher prices) for both
longer and less frequent intensifiers. This holds in quantitative judgments of meaning and in forced comparisons, and
across a number of adjectival dimensions. We conclude with
a discussion of different interpretations of these phenomena
and future directions.

We show how the wide range in strengths of intensifying degree adverbs (e.g. very and extremely) could be explained by
pragmatic inference based on differing cost, rather than differing semantics. This predicts a linear relationship between the
meaning of intensifiers and their length and log-frequency. We
test this prediction in two studies, using two different dependent measures, finding that higher cost does predict stronger
meanings. We discuss the implications for adverbial meaning
and the more general question of how extensive non-arbitrary
form-meaning association may be in language.

Introduction
How do different words get their meanings? For instance,
why is an “extremely good paper” better than a “quite good
paper”? The traditional answer (de Saussure, 1916) is that
different meanings have been arbitrarily and conventionally
assigned to the different word forms. This view has been
challenged by a number of examples in which word meaning appears to be non-arbitrarily related to properties of the
word. In some cases, the phonetic form of a word is systematically related to its meaning, for example rounded vowels and voiced consonants tend to refer to round objects
(Köhler, 1947; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001; Holland &
Wertheimer, 1964; Davis, 1961). In other cases, orthographic
form is diagnostic of meaning, for example, speakers of Hebrew who have never seen Chinese characters are nonetheless
above chance at matching them to their corresponding Hebrew words (Koriat & Levy, 1979). Similarly, the length of
words predicts aspects of their meanings: across languages
longer words refer to more complex meanings (Lewis, Sugarman, & Frank, 2014). In this paper, we explore adjectival
intensifiers1 , like extremely and quite, as a case study in which
to empirically explore the relationship of meaning to factors
like word form and distribution of usage. Intensifiers form
a good case study both because they are amenable to simple
quantitative measures of meaning (such as the numeric extent
to which they shift the interpretation of a scalar adjective) and

The semantics of intensifying degree adverbs
Our paper focuses on intensifying degree adverbs applied to
scalar adjectives2 . Scalar adjectives have been described as
having a threshold semantics (Kennedy, 2007), where, for example, expensive means “having a price greater than θ” and
θ is a semantic variable inferred from context (e.g., $100).
Above the threshold degree θ, the adjective is true of an object, and below, the adjective is false. Lassiter and Goodman
(2013) give a formal model of how this threshold might be
inferred for a particular context, which we extend to intensifiers.

1 Intensifiers are adverbs that modify scalar adjectives to increase
the degree. The word “intensifier” is often used to denote the
full range of degree adverbs, be they “amplifiers”, or “downtoners” (Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985). The “intensifiers” we are looking at in this paper are, according to this typology, “amplifiers” because they increase (rather than decrease) the
threshold associated with a gradable predicate. This typology also
distinguishes between two different kinds of amplifiers: those that
increase an adjective maximally (e.g. completely and utterly) and
those that merely increase (e.g. greatly and terribly). We do not
make this distinction. The word “intensifier” is sometimes used
for a completely different linguistic phenomenon, where a reflexive
is used for emphasis, e.g. “The king himself gave the command,”
which we do not analyze in this paper.

2 Some

of these intensifiers can also apply to verbal and nominal
predicates, and different restrictions apply for different intensifiers,
e.g. I truly like carrots is an acceptable utterance, whereas I very like
carrots is not. See Bolinger (1972) for a discussion.

Background

adjectival phrase, each with its own threshold variable. We
show that simply having different thresholds for different adjective phrases—and being aware of alternative utterances
and their relative communicative costs—is sufficient to communicate the wide range of degrees designated by intensifying degree adverbs.

Previous researchers have proposed that adjective phrases
modified by intensifiers have the same semantics as unmodified adjective phrases, except with new, higher thresholds
(Kennedy & McNally, 2005; Klein, 1980; Wheeler, 1972).
That is, some threshold, inferred from context, exists above
which objects are expensive and below which they are not,
and the intensifier very determines a new, higher threshold
for very expensive. They suggest that the intensified thresholds are determined by first collecting the set of objects in the
comparison class for which the bare adjective is true, and then
using that as the comparison class to infer a new threshold, i.e.
very expensive laptop means “expensive for an expensive laptop”. This analysis results in the expected intensification of
adjectives (“expensive for an expensive laptop” has a higher
threshold for being true than simply “expensive for a laptop”)
and is appropriately sensitive to different domains (e.g. the
absolute difference in price between thresholds for expensive
and very expensive is much higher in the context of “That
space station is very expensive,” than in the context of “That
coffee is very expensive.”). However, this account does not,
in and of itself, distinguish between the graded strengths of
different intensifiers, for example, very expensive and phenomenally expensive.
Intuition suggests that different intensifiers do have different strengths (e.g. outrageously seems stronger than quite),
and we provide further evidence of this in our experiments,
where participants interperet and compare different intensifiers. It could be that the degree of strength of different intensifiers is conventionally specified by the lexicon. But the
semantics must then specify how these entries affect the very
flexible threshold of the relevant adjective. In addition, the
multitude of intensifiers (Bolinger, 1972) and their apparent
productivity3 suggest a more parsimonious solution would be
welcome. That is, having a lexically determined meaning for
each different intensifier might overlook the similarity among
words of this class.
We propose instead that each time a scalar adjective is
used, in each phrase, it introduces a free threshold variable
(that is, a new token threshold is inferred for every time the
lexical entry of the adjective is accessed). Further we propose that intensifiers contribute nothing to the literal, compositional semantics4 . This implies that different adjectival
phrases (e.g. “very expensive watch” and “extremely expensive watch”) have equivalent meanings, though with thresholds that will be separately assigned based on context. However, the intensifiers do affect the production cost of the corresponding sentences, and it is this cost difference that results
in meaning differences.
We next outline and extend Lassiter and Goodman’s model
of scalar adjectives to include several copies of the relevant

Model
Lassiter and Goodman (2013)’s model belongs to the family of Rational Speech Act (RSA) models in which speaker
and listener communicate by recursively reasoning about
each other’s goals and inferences. These models have been
shown to account for many phenomena in pragmatics (Frank
& Goodman, 2012; Goodman & Stuhlmüller, 2013). The
adjective model accounts for uncertainty about the adjectival threshold by including a lifted semantic variable, which
the pragmatic listener infers at the same time that she infers
the speaker’s intended meaning. We assume every adjective
phrase has its own such variable θi 5 , together notated ~θ, but to
otherwise mean the same thing, so that, for example, expensive, very expensive and phenomenally expensive all denote:
λx.price(x) > θi .
Given an utterance ui (e.g. an expensive laptop or a very
expensive laptop) and a set of thresholds, a literal listener L0
will use Bayesian inference to update his prior beliefs P(d)
about the degree d (e.g. the laptop’s price) given that the
degree is greater than the threshold for that utterance.
PL0 (d|ui , θi ) ∝ P(d) · δd>θi
A speaker with the goal of communicating some actual degree d assigns a utility U(ui |d) to each utterance such that he
prefers utterances which will inform the literal listener, but
avoids utterance cost, C(ui ):
U(ui |d,~θ) = ln (PL0 (d|ui , θi )) −C(ui )
Given a set of alternative utterances (e.g. the speaker might
be choosing between saying very expensive as opposed to expensive or extremely expensive, or saying nothing at all), the
speaker S1 will choose utterances according to a softmax decision rule (Sutton & Barto, 1998) with optimality parameter
λ, so that:
~

PS1 (ui |d,~θ) ∝ eλU(ui |d,θ)
A pragmatic listener L1 uses the prior probability, P(d), of
different degrees, along with knowledge of the cost of each
5 Other

versions of this model could easily be imagined in which
the threshold for an adjective phrase is determined by the basic
threshold for the adjective and some transformation on that threshold
(e.g. multiplication, addition, etc.) caused by the intensifier. If the
transformation is mostly regular, with a single parameter needing to
be inferred for each intensifier, and if the values of these parameters
are inferred for each adjective phrase, then such a model would be
functionally equivalent to the one we describe here.

3 For example, altitidinously expensive is not in common usage,
but one can easily interpret altitidinously as a novel intensifier.
4 We take this strong view for rhetorical purposes. It is highly
likely that some intensifiers have other aspects of meaning.

ances are more costly) 8 and frequency (rarer intensifiers are
harder to access and therefore more costly). In a number of
different tasks, lexical frequency affects difficulty in an approximately logarithmic way. For instance word recognition
time (McCusker, 1977) and reading time in context (Smith &
Levy, 2013) are both logarithmic in frequency. We thus use
the log-frequency (whose negative is also called surprisal) as
the quantitative contribution to cost.
We thus predict a linear contribution of longer and higher
surprisal intensifiers to the meaning. This leaves open the the
relative importance of length and surprisal, and potential interactions (as well as other factors that might enter into cost),
which can be explored via regression models.

expected standardized "price"

As an initial exploration, we simulated such a model with
three alternative adjective phrases (i.e. three intensifiers) with
costs of 1, 5, and 10. We also included a null utterance, with
trivial meaning (always true) and cost of 0. The prior distribution of degrees along this adjective’s scale (which we will
discuss as “prices” for concreteness and consistency with our
Experiment 1) was a gaussian peaked at 0. We used an optimality parameter of λ = 5 in our simulation.
Though the literal semantics are identical (except that they
have different threshold parameters), the different phrases received different interpretations: the more costly intensifiers
corresponded to less probable, more extreme prices (Figure
1). This can be seen as an M-implicature: more costly intensifiers are assigned strong, less probable, meanings. The
model therefore predicts an association between intensifier
meaning and utterance cost.

standardized "prices"

The proposal detailed above predicts an association between
measures of cost and strength of interpretations. In Experiment 1, we test this qualitative prediction by eliciting free response price estimates from people and determining whether
these prices are correlated with our independent measures of
utterance cost.

costly intensifiers correspond to more extreme meanings.

Factors affecting utterance cost

Method9

We have identified the intensifier’s cost, C(ui ), as a potentially critical factor of its interpreted meaning. The quantitative form predicted by the model of the relationship between
cost and meaning is a approximately linear (Figure 2).7 .
To connect this linear prediction to empirical facts, we still
must specify (at least a subset of) the factors we expect to
impact cost. The most natural notion of cost is the effort a
speaker incurs to produce an utterance. This could include
cognitive effort to access lexical items from memory, articulatory effort to produce the sound forms, and other such direct costs. Speakers might also seek to minimize comprehension cost for their listeners, resulting in other contributions to
cost. For the purposes of this paper, we restrict to the most
straightforward contributors to production cost and use proxies that are straightforward to quantify: length (longer utter-

30 participants with US IP addresses were recruited through
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and paid $0.40 for their participation, of whom 1 was excluded for saying they did not follow
the directions in a post-experiment survey.
We asked participants to estimate the prices of different
objects based on descriptions of those objects. The descriptions included intensifiers paired with the adjective expensive
(Figure 3). There were three categories of objects (laptop,
watch, and coffee maker) and 40 intensifiers (see Table 1). We
chose intensifiers that have a wide range of frequencies and
excluded intensifiers that are either more commonly used to
signal affect than to signal degree (e.g. “depressingly expensive” might indicate a degree, but it mainly indicates affect)
8 We measure length in number of syllables, although length in
characters (which might be a relevant source of utterance cost in a
written format, as our experiments were in) has similar predictive
power to syllable length in all of our analyses.

or are ambiguous between other parts of speech (e.g. “super”
can be used as an intensifier, as in “super expensive”, but it
can also be used as an adjective, as in “super hero”). Each
particpant gave price judgments for every intensifier-category
pairing in a randomized order (different for different participants).We chose the domain of price and used only the adjective expensive because price constitutes a quantitative scale
with standard units (dollars for our US participants) on which
to measure the different intensifers.

price estimates as the dependent variable, because of evidence
that people’s representation of numbers, including prices, is
logarithmic (Dehaene, 2003, e.g.)11 .
Our results are shown in Figure 4. Both measures
of cost play a role in predicting participants’ price estimates. We found a significant main effect of surprisal (β =
0.0536, SE = 0.00902,t(3) = 5.94, p < 0.05) such that less
frequent words tend to be associated with higher price estimates. We also found a significant main effect of syllable length (β = 0.0900, SE = 0.0189,t(4) = 4.76, p < 0.05),
above and beyond surprisal, such that longer words predict
stronger meanings. We also found a significant interaction
(β = 0.0196, SE = 0.00520,t(3.5) = 3.77, p < 0.0005) between surprisal and syllable length, wich may indicate that
the relationship between the two predictors of cost is not simply additive, and that having multiple sources of communicative cost (i.e. length and surprisal) might increase the implicature even more. Although these effects are significant,
the marginal and conditional R2 values (Barton, 2015) were
0.015 and 0.72 respectively, indicating that much of the variance in estimated prices is captured by the random effects
rather than the fixed effects of surprisal and syllable length.
Overall, intensifiers that are less frequent and longer (and
therefore are more costly to utter) also tend to be interpreted
as having stronger meanings, at least when used to modify
expensive. Furthermore, the relationship appears to be linear in surprisal and length (though with an interaction), as
predicted. This is consistent with the M-implicature model
introduced above.

Figure 3: Screenshot from Experiment 1 target question.
Corpus Methods Table 1 shows word frequency and length
in syllables for the intensifiers used in the experiment. The
frequencies were collected from the Google Web 1T 5-grams
database (Brants & Franz, 2006)10 In the analysis below we
use word length and word surprisal (negative log-frequency)
as proxies for a word’s cost, as motivated above. The syllable lengths of our intensifiers and the surprisals were clearly
correlated, but not strongly so (r = 0.27, t = 16, p < 5e − 16).

Results and Discussion
If the meaning of an intensifier is stronger for higher cost intensifiers, we would expect to find that as surprisal increases
and length in syllables increases, the prices participants give
will also increase. We find that this is the case.
We ran a linear mixed effects regression with centered fixed
effects of syllables, surprisal, and their interaction, and random intercepts and slopes for syllables and surprisal for both
participant and object. We used the logarithm of participants’

Experiment 2
The M-implicature account described above implies that
there is no semantic interaction between the intensifier and
the adjective it is applied to. Instead an intensifier should contribute similar cost, and therefore meaning, to the different
adjectival phrases in which it occurs12 . To explore this issue,
11 I.e. the perceptual distance between two prices the same dollar
amount apart is more for small numbers (e.g. $3 and $6) and less for
large numbers (e.g. $1,543 and $1,546).

Figure 4: Results of Experiment 1. As surprisal and length in syllables increase, participants’ free response prices increased.
we would like to extend our results to additional adjectival
scales. However, most scales are not so easily quantifiable
as price; we require a different dependent measure in order
to probe them. For Experiment 2 we used a forced-ranking
dependent measure, which allows us to consider additional
adjectival scales. This dependent measure has the added benefit of providing a more sensitive measure of the differences
in degrees between similar adjectival phrases.

Method13
30 participants with US IP addresses were recruited through
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and paid $0.40 for participation.
3 said they did not follow the directions in a post-experiment
survey and were excluded from the analysis.
We asked participants to order (by clicking and dragging)
various adjective phrases with the same adjective but different intensifiers according to strength of meaning. Because
arranging these phrases required participants to be aware of
the full set of adjective phrases and access all of them on the
same computer screen, not all of our 40 intensifiers could effectively be presented at once. We divided the 40 intensifiers
from Experiment 1 into four lists of 10 intensifiers. Each list
was randomly paired with one of four adjectives (old, expensive, beautiful, and tall). For each adjective-list pairing, participants were shown every combination of the 10 intensifiers
with one adjective. Participants were asked to move the adjective phrases across the screen, reordering the phrases from
the “lowest” to the “highest” degree (Figure 5). Each participant completed four trials, seeing all four lists and all four
adjectives. The list-adjective pairings were randomized between participants.The division of the intensifiers into lists of
10 was constant, so that the same 10 intensifiers were always
shown together.

prisal and syllable lengths and their interaction as fixed effects, and random intercepts and slopes for syllables and
surprisal for both participant and adjective. As in Experiment 1, we found strong main effects of surprisal (β =
0.432, SE = 0.0934,t = 4.63, p < 0.05) and syllable length
(β = 0.671, SE = 0.122,t = 5.50, p < 0.005), and a significant interaction (β = 0.0725, t = 2.01, p < 0.05). In this
experiment, a much higher proportion of our explained variance was due to our fixed effects (marginal R2 = 0.18, and
conditional R2 = 0.22). In other words, we again found that
participants assign stronger interpretations to intensifiers with
higher surprisals and/or higher syllable lengths, extending
now across four different adjectival scales.

General Discussion
Motivated by a recent probabilistic model of scalar adjectives
(Lassiter & Goodman, 2013), we showed how adjectival intensifiers could potentially get their meaning through a pragmatic M-implicature, despite having vacuous literal meaning
to add to an adjective. Our model predicted a linear relationship between the intensity of an intensifier and its cost,
measured here in terms of length and log-frequency. In two
experiments we provided evidence that intensifier meanings
do depend systematically on the length and frequency of distribution of those word forms. While it is unlikely that this ac-

Results and Discussion
Our results for Experiment 2 are shown in Figure 6. We
ran an ordinal mixed effects regression with centered surquencies our frequency-based cost account would predict an interactive effect on meaning. This would be a relatively small effect, and
the relevant bigrams were too sparse in our corpora to pursue.

counts for all intensifier meaning, it does suggest that a major
portion of meaning comes not from arbitrary, conventional
association of signal to sign (de Saussure, 1916), but from
features of the word’s form and distribution.
It should be noted that, since this is a correlational study,
such a relationship does not confirm that an intensifier’s cost
causes it to have a given meaning. This correlation is predicted by the model sketched above, but it might be predicted
by other analyses of intensifiers and their meanings. Rarity
in particular might be correlated with strength of meaning
merely because more extreme meanings refer to less probable things in the world, are therefore talked about less, and
therefore the words with those meanings will necessarily be
rarer. Although it seems reasonable to suspect that word frequencies reflect the probabilities of the real-world concepts
they describe, it might also be the case that improbable things
are more likely to be commented on, and so the frequencies
of words that describe rare concepts might be inflated. In addition, this confound on causal direction exists only for word
frequency (and its effect on syllable length) and not for syllable length directly. Although the length of a word certainly
depends on frequency of use, it seems unlikely that it also depends directly on the real-word prevalence of the concept it
refers to.
A number of issues remain to future work, including the
causality of the relationship we have described and the other
aspects of intensifier meaning (such as polarity or affective
color). However we believe that the preliminary results presented in this paper already have interesting implications. For
the semantics of adverbial modifiers, we have shown how
pragmatic mechanisms could be central in establishing flexible contributions to sentence meaning. For the broader question of form-meaning mapping, we have suggested a source
of non-arbitrary association based on both properties of the
word form and of its distribution.
