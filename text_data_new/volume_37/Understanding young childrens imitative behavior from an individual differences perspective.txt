Abstract
Research has shown that after observing a sequence of
object-related actions, young children sometimes imitate the
goal-directed aspects of the actions only, but other times faithfully
imitate all aspects of the actions. In this study we explore whether
this mixture of goal-directed and faithful imitation is based in part
on individual differences between children. Forty-eight 2-year-old
children (mean age = 26 months) completed a series of imitation
tasks. Results revealed stable individual differences in children’s
imitation—measurements of their imitative behavior correlated
both within and between different types of imitation tasks. We
further used Principle Component Analyses to cluster these
correlated measurements into two factors, and the two factors
aligned well with the concepts of goal-directed and faithful
imitation.

Introduction
Imitation is a powerful form of children’s learning, and it is
vital to the development of abilities ranging from language
to social skills. Developmental research on children’s
imitative behavior has documented two seemingly
contradictory phenomena. One line of research suggests that
children selectively copy actions and aspects of actions that
are goal-directed. Another line of research finds that
children faithfully copy all actions and aspects of actions,
even when they are apparently irrelevant to the goal of the
model. In this study we ask whether these different types of
imitative behavior may be based in part on individual
differences.
Awareness of the goals of people’s actions appear early in
infancy (Woodward, 1998). Starting from the second year of
life, infants and young children selectively copy actions that
are performed intentionally over actions that are performed
accidentally (Carpenter, Akhtar, & Tomasello, 1998), that
fail to achieve the model’s goal (Meltzoff, 1995), and that
are forced by environmental constraints (Gergely,
Bekkering, & Király, 2002). It should be noted that goals of
actions can be hierarchically organized—in the absence of
an obvious external goal, children are more likely to copy
the manner of a model’s action, thus perhaps inferring that
to be the goal (Bekkering, Wohlschlager, & Gattis, 2000;
Carpenter, Call, & Tomasello, 2005).
On the other hand, research has documented a very
different tendency in children’s imitation—to be faithful to
the model’s actions even when there exists an obvious
external goal. Across many studies in a variety of contexts,
young children faithfully copy actions and aspect of actions

that are apparently useless or irrelevant to achieving an
external goal, such as retrieving a reward (e.g., Horner &
Whiten, 2005; Lyons, Young, & Keil, 2007; Nagell, Olguin,
& Tomasello, 1993; Nielsen, 2006). Children at times copy
goal-irrelevant actions even when they know doing so will
reduce their chance of retrieving the reward (Lyons,
Damrosch, Lin, Macris, & Keil, 2011). Importantly,
children do not reproduce those actions merely because they
mistaken them as being goal-relevant, because they verbally
report those actions to be unnecessary for achieving the goal
before or after copying them (Kenward, Karlsson, &
Persson, 2011; Yu & Kushnir, 2014).
One explanation for the different imitative behavior
across studies is that they occur in different contexts.
Research has shown that even very slight modifications in
the social context can significantly change how children
imitate (Brugger, Lariviere, Mumme, & Bushnell, 2007;
Nielsen, 2006; Yu & Kushnir, 2014). Different contexts
may affect children’s inferences about the objective of a
social interaction: if children believe the objective is mainly
instrumental, this may lead to more goal-directed imitation.
Conversely, if they believe the objective is social or
affiliative, this would lead to more faithful imitation (Over
& Carpenter, 2012).
While this explanation has much empirical support
suggesting that context is certainly important, there is
another possible contributor to differences in imitative
behavior that has received less research attention. This is the
possibility that there are intrinsic factors that lead to
individual differences in how children imitate. One such
factor is age: Preschoolers have been shown to imitate more
faithfully than toddlers (McGuigan & Whiten, 2009;
McGuigan, Whiten, Flynn, & Horner, 2007; Yu & Kushnir,
2014). However, goal-directed and faithful imitation have
often been observed in children of the same age and in the
same context (McGuigan & Whiten, 2009; Nielsen, 2006;
Yu & Kushnir, 2011), thus age by itself cannot account for
all of the remaining variability.
A few recent studies have found connections between
individual infant’s understanding and replication of
goal-directed and goal-irrelevant actions and other aspects
of development. For example, infants’ habituation rate
towards goal-directed actions has been shown to predict
their theory of mind ability in preschool years (Wellman,
Lopez-Duran, LaBounty, & Hamilton, 2008). Also, infants
who are rated high in extraversion imitate more faithfully
than their peers who are rated low in extraversion (Hilbrink,
Sakkalou, Ellis-Davies, Fowler, & Gattis, 2013). These
studies suggest that individual differences in imitation may
exist, may be stable, and may be related to children’s

2769

sociability or social cognition. They further lend support to
the idea that individual differences should be preserved
across various types of imitation tasks (i.e. across various
instrumental and social contexts). We explore this idea in
the following study.
In this study we systematically investigated individual
differences in imitative behavior by administrating a series
of imitation tasks to a group of 2-year-old children. We
chose 2-year-olds because previous studies suggest a
mixture of goal-directed and faithful imitation on average at
this age, as well as a large amount of behavioral variation
across even the same types of imitation tasks (e.g.,
McGuigan & Whiten, 2009; Yu & Kushnir, 2014). The
imitation tasks we employed included both those
emphasizing an instrumental goal and those emphasizing a
social goal.
We employed the puzzle box tasks from five previous
imitation studies (Brugger, et al., 2007; Horner & Whiten,
2005; Lyons, et al., 2011; Nielsen, Moore, & Mohamedally,
2012; Yu & Kushnir, 2014). In these tasks children see an
action sequence leading to the retrieval of a reward from a
puzzle box. The action sequence comprises one or two
actions that are irrelevant for retrieving the reward, followed
by one or two actions that are relevant, and finally the
retrieval of the reward. We measured children’s
goal-directed imitation by calculating the percentage of
goal-relevant actions they imitated, and we measured their
faithful imitation by calculating the percentage of
goal-irrelevant actions they imitated. We predicted
individual children’s imitative response to be correlated
among these different puzzle box tasks.
We also employed the puppet show task (Carpenter, et al.,
2005), in which an experimenter moves a puppet to either a
cardboard house (House condition) or a same location
without a house (No House condition), and she does the
action in a particular manner (a certain style accompanied
by a sound). The presence or absence of the house leads to
condition differences in imitation; infants will usually match
the final location when a house is present, and match the
manner of the action when the house is absent. In our study
we measured children’s goal-directed imitation by
calculating the number of goals they matched (final location
in House condition and manner in No House condition). We
also measured their faithful imitation by the amount of
action manner children matched regardless of condition.
Though we expected to replicate the usual condition
differences on the group level, we also predicted that
individual children’s imitation would be correlated between
conditions.
The context established in these two types of tasks is
similar in some ways (all involve imitation), but also
importantly different. In the puzzle box tasks, the relevance
of actions to the goal is established by physical cause and
effect (the goal-relevant actions are physically necessary to
retrieve the reward, and the goal-irrelevant actions are
unnecessary). In the puppet show tasks, the relevance of
aspects of actions to the goal is established by the model’s

intentions (the location is the goal in the House condition
because the model intended to put the puppet in the house;
in the absence of the location, the model’s intentions must
be inferred to be otherwise). Thus, in our final analysis, we
looked to see if individual differences could account for
some of the differences in imitative behavior that might
transcend immediate contextual influences. To the extent
that individual factors contribute to differences in imitative
behavior, we expected to see correlations in children’s
imitative behavior across these two types of tasks.

Method
Participants
Participants were 48 2-year-olds (21 boys, mean age = 26
mo, range = 23-32 mo) recruited from a small town in
upstate NY. One additional child was tested but excluded
from analysis because she did not understand English.
According to parental report, 79% of the included children
are Caucasian, 98% of their primary caregivers have college
diploma or higher, and 85% of their families have an annual
household income > $50,000. Children received stickers for
their participation, and their parents received $10.

Procedure
The same male experimenter (E) and one of eight assistants
conducted the experiment. Children first warmed up with E
and assistant in a laboratory corridor filled with toys. After
children felt comfortable, they were introduced into a
playroom where all testing take place. E sat facing children
across a table for all tasks except for the third set of puzzle
box tasks, in which both E and children played on the floor
away from the table. The accompanying parents sat next to
children in a separate chair, and were instructed to remain
neutral. All sessions were videotaped.
During testing children completed the puzzle box tasks
and puppet show task as part of a longer testing session.
Because our major interest in this study was individual
differences, all tasks were presented in a fixed order (first
set of puzzle boxes, second set of puzzle boxes, puppet
show task, third set of puzzle boxes). These imitation tasks
were interspersed throughout the longer testing session.
Puzzle box tasks. We built three sets of puzzle boxes, with
three boxes in each set. The first set (the Flower Box, the
Ramp, and the Rake) mimicked those originally used in
Brugger and colleague’s study (2007), and was recently
used in Yu & Kushnir (2014). The second set (the Blue Box,
the Switch Box and the Artificial Fruit) mimicked those
used in Nielson and colleague’s study (2012). The third set
comprised a replicate of the Clear Box (Horner & Whiten,
2005), as well as replicates of the Monkey Box and the
Prize Box (Lyons, et al., 2011). Each of these puzzle boxes
contained a reward in them, and was associated with an
action sequence to retrieve the reward. Each of these action
sequences comprised one or two actions that are irrelevant
for retrieving the reward, followed by one or two actions

2770

that are relevant, and finally the retrieval of the reward.
Notably, the boxes in the third set were mostly used for
preschoolers in previous studies, and one study which used
them with 2-year-olds showed only 17% of children
imitated the goal-irrelevant actions (McGuigan & Whiten,
2009). We expect the same to happen in our study.
In our study, each child played with three puzzle boxes,
one from each set. For each task, E presented the puzzle box,
said “Watch me”, and demonstrated the action sequence in a
slow, deliberate fashion. At the end he took out the reward
and showed it to children. He then removed the box and the
reward from children’s view, and placed the reward back
inside. He returned the box, saying “Now your turn”.
Children played with the box until they retrieved the reward,
or until they lost interest in the box. The videos were coded
along three independent dimensions: how many
goal-relevant children imitated, how many goal-irrelevant
actions they imitated, and whether they retrieved the reward.
Videos from 10 children (21% of all children) were coded
by a second coder, and inter-rater reliability was high
(Cohen’s Kappa = 1 for reward retrieval, 0.90 for imitation
of goal-relevant actions, and 1 for imitation of
goal-irrelevant actions).
Puppet show task. The puppet show task was administrated
and coded in an identical way as in the original research
(Carpenter, et al., 2005), the only difference being we
reduced the number of trials from eight to four. In each trial
children were presented with one of two mats on the table:
an empty mat (No House condition) or a mat with two
cardboard houses on the centers of the mat’s left half and
right half (House condition). In both conditions, E moved a
puppet (e.g., a mouse) towards the center of the mat’s left
half or right half. In the House condition the final location
was inside one of the houses. In the No House condition the
final location was the same spot on the mat, but not in a
house. The final location was to the left side of the mat for
half the trials in each condition, and was to the right side for
the other half. E used one of two action styles when moving
the puppet: he either made the puppet jump on the mat
several times (“hopping”), or slid the puppet without
breaking contact with the mat (“sliding”). E always made a
repeated short sound (e.g., “bebebe…”) to accompany the
hopping style, and he made a long sound (e.g., “beeeee…”)
to accompany the sliding style. The puppet was made to hop
in half of the trials in each condition, and to slide in the
other half. The order of condition (House vs. No House),
style (hopping vs. sliding) and final location (left vs. right)
were counterbalanced between children.
In each of the four trials, E first elicited children’s
attention by calling their names. He said “Watch me”, and
moved the puppet to one of the final locations. E then
picked up the puppet and placed it in front of children. E
told children, “Your turn”, and waited children’s response
till he or she stopped handling the puppet. The videos were
coded for whether children matched E on style, sound effect
and final location. Videos from 10 children (21% of all

children) were coded by a second coder, and inter-rater
reliability was high (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.84 for style, 1 for
sound, and 0.85 for location).

Results
The results section is organized as follows: We first report
children’s responses within each set of imitation tasks, then
report correlations of children’s responses between tasks.

Puzzle box tasks
All three puzzle boxes tasks were administrated to all
children. One child (2%) provided no relevant response
throughout all three tasks. This child was included in data
analysis, though excluding her would not qualitatively
change any of the results.
Overall children retrieved the reward for 76% of the
puzzle boxes (SD = 31%). They imitated the goal-relevant
action for 79% of the puzzle boxes (SD = 27%), and they
imitated the goal-irrelevant action for 43% of the puzzle
boxes (SD = 27%), the difference between goal-relevant and
goal-irrelevant actions was significant, t(47) = 4.42, p
< .001, d = 0.64. Therefore, we observed evidence for both
goal-directed imitation (as children copied more
goal-relevant actions than goal-irrelevant actions) and
faithful imitation (as children still copied 43% of the
goal-irrelevant actions).
Next we investigated individual differences by analyzing
intercorrelations between the outcome measurements. Not
surprisingly, the retrieval of reward was predicted by the
imitation of goal-relevant actions for each puzzle box
(rs > .43, ps < .002), but not predicted by the imitation of
goal-irrelevant actions (rs < .16, ps > .2). Moreover, the
outcome measurements were correlated across the three sets
of puzzle boxes. For retrieval of rewards, we observed
correlations for all three pairs of sets (rs > .26, ps < .07). For
imitation of goal-relevant actions, the correlation was
significant between the first and second sets (r = .41, p
= .004), and was marginally significant between the first and
third set (r = .24, p = .10). For imitation of goal-irrelevant
actions, the correlation was significant between the first and
second sets (r = .41, p = .004). The percentage of
goal-irrelevant actions children imitated in the third set was
low (M = 16%, SD = 31%), and was not significantly
correlated with that of the first two sets, possibly due to a
floor effect. These correlations confirmed our hypothesis
about consistency in individual children’s imitative behavior.
We computed composite scores of “faithful imitation” and
“goal-directed imitation” by summing up the percentages of
goal-irrelevant and goal-relevant actions children imitated in
each set.

Puppet show task
Three children (6%) were not included in the analysis for
the puppet show task because they were too distracted or
fuzzy to complete the task. Data from the remaining 45
children were used, including one child (2%) who provided
no relevant response throughout all four trials. Excluding

this child would not qualitatively change any of the results.
We replicated the results of the original study (Carpenter,
et al., 2005) in showing different imitative behavior
between conditions. In the House condition children were
more likely to match location than to match style and sound,
location vs. style: t(44) = 2.94, p = .005, d = 0.44, location
vs. sound: t(44) = 4.08, p < .001, d = 0.61, style vs. sound:
t(44) = 0.65, ns. In the No House condition they were more
likely to match style and sound than to match location, and
also more likely to match style than to match sound,
location vs. style: t(44) = -6.57, p < .001, d = -0.98, location
vs. sound: t(44) = -2.46, p = .02, d = -0.37, style vs. sound:
t(44) = 4.74, p < .001, d = 0.71.
To rule out possible order effect, we first compared the
dependent measurements based on the order E
administrated the four trials, and results showed no
difference for any of the dependent measurements (ps > .3).
We also analyzed children’s responses in the first trial, and
results showed the same pattern as when all four trials were
considered: For those tested in the House condition first (24
children total), 11 children matched location but did not
match style or sound, and 5 children matched style or sound
but did not match location. For those tested in the No House
condition first (21 children), no child matched location but
did not match style or sound, and 9 children matched style
or sound and did not match location. The patterns across the
two conditions were significantly different, Fisher’s exact p
= .001.
We then examined intercorrelations among different
measurements (Table 1). As predicted, we observed
correlations of matching style and sound across conditions,
rs > .27, ps < .07, which showed stability in children’s
faithful imitation. Also as predicted, the matching of final
location in the House condition was correlated with the
matching of style and sound in the No House condition,
rs > .26, ps < .08, which showed stability in children’s
goal-directed imitation.
We further performed a Principle Component Analysis
(PCA) to cluster these correlated measurements into lucid
factors. When applied to behavioral studies, PCAs are
typically used for evaluating the validity of tasks and
measurements (e.g., Carlson, Mandell, & Williams, 2004).
However, at its essence a PCA extract factors from
analyzing the variance across individuals, therefore it is also
an ideal tool for understanding the underlying structure of

individual differences. Here we used IBM SPSS 20 to
perform the PCA. We submitted all six measurements
(matching of style, sound and location in the two conditions)
to the PCA, and used oblique rotation (oblimin) to allow
factors to correlate. Presumption check showed that sample
size was adequate for the analysis (overall KMO statistic =
0.60, KMO for all variables > 0.5), and the variables were
sufficiently correlated (Bartlett’s test p < .001,
communalities for all variables > .3). Results revealed two
factors with eigenvalue > 1 (Table 2). The first component
had high loadings on all four measurements we
hypothesized to represent faithful imitation (matching style
and sound in both conditions). The second component had
high loadings on all three measurements we hypothesized to
represent goal-directed imitation (matching final location in
the House condition, and matching style and sound in the
No House condition). In addition, it also had high loadings
on matching final location in the No House condition. One
possible explanation is that when the house was absent the
goal of the action was unclear; and since the final location
was still a salient element of the action, children still treated
it as a part of the goal. Two variables (matching style and
sound in No House condition) showed high loadings on
both factors, but this was expected based on our hypothesis.
The first factor explained 42% of the total variance, and the
second factor explained an additional 18%. We computed
composite scores by summing up variables that has a
loading > 0.4 on the factor, and named them “faithful
imitation” and “goal-directed imitation”.

Correlation between tasks
As hypothesized, we observed individual differences in how
children imitated within the puppet show task and the
puzzle box tasks. Next we explored children’s imitative
behavior across these two different types of tasks (Table 3).
As predicted, goal-directed imitation in the two types of
tasks was positively correlated (r = .33, p = .03), and
faithful imitation in these two types of tasks was also
positively correlated (r = .32, p = .03). Therefore children
reliably vary along how goal-directed and how faithful they
imitate across tasks.
To confirm these results we further performed a PCA
with all six measurements from the puppet show task and
all three measurements from the puzzle box tasks. The
presumptions for the analysis were all met (overall KMO
statistic = 0.63, KMO for all variables > 0.5, Bartlett’s test p
< .001), and again we used oblique rotation (oblimin).
Results again revealed two factors with eigenvalue > 1
(Table 4). The first factor had high loadings on all
measurements representing faithful imitation. The second
factor had high loadings on all measurements representing
goal-directed imitation (the loading on matching sound in
the No House condition was lower than .4 but still above .3),
as well as matching location in the No House condition. The
first factor explained 32% of the total variance, and the
second factor explained an additional 19%. Composite
scores were computed by summing up variables that has a
loading > 0.4. Composite scores for the two factors were
positively correlated with each other (r = .32, p = .03).

In this study we looked at 2-year-old children’s imitation of
a model’s actions on objects. With a same group of children
who are similar in age, we administrated both imitation
tasks with an instrumental goal and imitation tasks with a
social goal. We found that 1) on a group level, 2-year-olds
showed tendencies for both goal-directed and faithful
imitation that are similar to those found in prior work
emphasizing contextual influences on children’s imitative
behavior; 2) beyond this, there were stable individual
differences in imitative behavior both within and across
tasks; and 3) two major factors that characterize these
individual differences align well with the concepts of
goal-directedness and faithfulness in the imitation literature,
and when combined these two factors explained more than
half of the variance observed in children’s imitative
behavior.
We started exploring individual differences in imitative
behavior by examining intercorrelations within each type of
imitation tasks. Results showed stable individual differences
in imitative behavior across different stimuli in the puzzle
box tasks, and between different conditions in the puppet
show task.
Furthermore, the individual differences in imitative
behavior was stable across tasks—goal-directed imitation in
the two tasks was positively correlated, and faithful
imitation in the two tasks was positively correlated. Given
that puzzle box tasks featured instrumental goals the and the
puppet show tasks featured social goals, these correlations
show that the observed individual differences transcend
contextual influences such as inferences about the goals of a
particular task.
We further employed PCAs to confirm and clarify the
intercorrelations. When we submit all measurements of all
tasks to a PCA, it extracted two factors that collectively
explained 51% of the total variance. One factor has high
loadings on measurements representing goal-directed
imitation, and the other factor has high loadings on
measurements representing faithful imitation.
Critically, the final composite scores representing
goal-directed and faithful imitation correlated positively
with each other. This final result suggests that these two
may together represent a broader construct which captures
how likely individual children are to imitate in any given
social interaction; children can vary from not imitating at all
(thus low on both factors) to imitating all components of the
model (thus high on both factors).
This study provides a first demonstration of how
analyzing individual differences can contribute to our
understanding of children’s imitative behavior. It leads to a
new set of questions: For example, if some children at age 2
are more “imitative” than others, how stable are these
differences with age? Are these differences concurrently or
predictively related to other aspects of cognitive and social
development? Do these differences have any direct
influence on what individual children are likely to learn
from social interactions? To address these questions, future

2773

research needs to examine individual differences in a wider
range of tasks, and to longitudinally assess the stability of
these individual differences across ages. These researches
will provide valuable insights on how social learning varies
in young children, and may help to create effective social
environments to support individual children’s learning.
