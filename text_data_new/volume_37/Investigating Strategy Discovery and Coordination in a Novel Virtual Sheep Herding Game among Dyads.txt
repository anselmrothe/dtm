Abstract
Previous research investigating the dynamical processes
supporting coordinated joint action has typically used nongoal-directed tasks. The present study expands on this
research by investigating the coordination that emerges
among pairs in a complex, goal-directed task of herding
virtual sheep to the center of a field. The results revealed that
the majority of pairs converged on the same stable movement
coordination strategy in order to complete the task. This
strategy involved pairs moving in an in-phase or anti-phase
oscillatory pattern around the sheep. By adopting this strategy
pairs formed an interpersonal synergy. Interestingly, the
strength of this synergy was modulated by the number of
sheep being herded. More specifically, more dimensional
compression was observed among pairs when herding the 7sheep compared to herding 3 or 5 sheep. The implications of
these results for understanding how task difficulty and
mutually defined environmental co-regulation influenced the
behavioral dynamics of coordinated joint-action are
discussed.

Introduction
Joint action is generally defined as a “social interaction
whereby two or more individuals coordinate their actions in
space and time to bring about a change in the environment.”
(Knoblich, Butterfill, & Sebanz, 2011). Examples of joint
action include moving a couch with a friend, setting the
table with your partner, playing a game of basketball, or
deciding with classmates how to tackle an assigned group
project.

Although a great deal of previous research has been
directed towards understanding the top-down processes
involved in successful joint-action, such as task monitoring
and action prediction, (Sebanz, Knoblich, & Prinz, 2005;
Welsh et al., 2007; Atmaca, Sebanz, & Knoblich, 2011),
understanding the bottom-up behavioral dynamics of jointaction is equally important (Knoblich, Butterfill & Sebanz,
2011; Tollefsen & Dale, 2011). This includes determining
how the physical, informational and environmental variables
that define a task context and goal operate to structure and
constrain the patterns of coordinated joint action behavior
that are possible (Kelso, 1995; Saltzman & Kelso, 1997;
Warren, 2006; Oullier et al., 2008; Schmidt & Richardson,
2008).
With regard to investing the behavioral dynamics of jointaction, a number of previous studies (Richardson et al.,
2007; Schmidt, Carello, & Turvey, 1990; Schmidt et al.,
1998; Schmidt & O’Brien, 1997) have demonstrated that the
patterns of movement coordination that occur between the
rhythmic limb or body movements of interacting individuals
are equivalent to those observed for intrapersonal interlimb
rhythmic movement coordination (Haken, Kelso, & Bunz,
1985) and can be predicted and modeled using a system of
coupled oscillators (see Schmidt & Richardson for a
review). This is true, irrespective of whether the rhythmic
movement coordination that occurs between interacting
individual is intentional or unintentional (Coey et al., 2011;
Issartel, Marin, & Cadopi, 2007; Miles et al., 2011; Oullier
et al., 2008; Richardson et al., 2007; Schmidt & O’Brien,
1997; van Ulzen et al., 2008).
One significant implication of the previous research
examining the dynamics of interpersonal rhythmic

1703

coordination is that it suggests that the movements and
actions of coordinating individuals form an interpersonal
synergy (Riley et al., 2011). In movement science, a synergy
refers to the reduction of multiple elements to form a single
functional unit (Latash, 2008; Turvey, 1990). The motor
system creates synergies to simplify the movement of
various components and to promote stability (the elements
are linked so they can compensate for one other if one is
perturbed or fluctuates). For example, in human speech the
elements (the speech articulators, i.e., lips, jaws, tongue,
vocal tract) become tightly coordinated and are controlled as
a single unit at the macro-scale. Thus, if one element of the
speech system (e.g., the lower jaw) is perturbed during
speech, others compensate in lock step (within as little as 20
msec delays) in order to assure the intended speech sound is
achieved (Kelso et al., 1984).
A defining characteristic of a movement synergy is
dimensional compression (DC) (Riley et al., 2011). DC
refers to the reduction of the controlled movement degreesof-freedom (df) or overall system dimensionality and results
from a coupling of component df together, such that the
movement of one motor df is connected to or dependent on
the movement of others. The significance of DC is that it
not only reduces motor system dimensionality, thereby
simplifying control, but also improves a system’s functional
resistance to unexpected situational constraints or
perturbations via the non-local component adaptations
(Riley, et al., 2011; Romero et al., under review).
Although the synergistic property of DC has been
observed across a range of joint action tasks (e.g., Black,
Riley & McCord, 2007; Ramenzoni et al., 2011; Riley et al.,
2011; Romero et al., under review), most of this research
has relied on either non-goal-directed, or minimally goaldirected tasks. For instances, two individuals rhythmically
coordinating wrist-pendulums (Black et al., 2007) or one
individual moving a stick through a hoop held by a partner
(Ramenzoni et al., 2011). Thus, a more generalized
understanding of the role of synergistic coordination in
everyday goal-directed joint-action remains limited.
Accordingly, the goal of the present study was to expand
this sub-field of joint-action research by investigating the
coordination dynamics that occur for a more complex goaldirected joint-action task. To do this, we designed a simple
video-game that resembled sheep herding. The goal of the
game was for pairs of participants to work together to
contain virtual sheep (i.e. small, ‘wool’-covered balls)
within the center of a virtual field presented on a large
tabletop display (see Figure 1a). The sheep were repelled
away from virtual dogs (grey boxes) that the players’
controlled using hand held motion tracking sensors.
The task was inspired by a single player game employed
by Dotov, Nie and Chemero (2010), in which subjects used
a mouse to control an on-screen cursor that repelled objects
as the cursor approached them. The goal was to move the
objects to a specific location on a screen. (see also Nie,
Dotov, and Chemero, 2011.) An important finding was that
the patterns of fluctuations of participant hand movements

followed a pattern characteristic of synergistically organized
systems (Anderson, Richardson & Chemero, 2012; Van
Orden et al., 2003). We sought to investigate whether the
behavior of two individuals coordinating together to
complete a comparable game would also become
synergistic. Accordingly, the aims of the current study were
to determine the successful coordination patterns or
strategies that emerged and then quantify the degree to
which these strategies resulted in DC. The number of sheep
(3, 5 or 7) pairs had to corral was manipulated in order to
determine whether task difficulty (i.e., the number of sheep)
facilitated the discovery of synergistic stable task solutions.

Method
Participants
Forty-five right-handed undergraduate student pairs from
the University of Cincinnati participated in the experiment.
Pairs were randomly assigned to one of three betweensubject conditions, which determined how many sheep they
needed to herd (3, 5, or 7 sheep). Participants received
research credit as compensation for participating in the
experiment.

Apparatus
A visual depiction of the sheep herding game is pictured in
Figure 1b. The game takes place in a top-down view of a
1.17m by 0.62m fenced grass field. Players were allowed to
move within the fenced area, with handheld Polhemus
motion tracking sensors moving grey boxes (hereafter
referred to as sheepdogs) that that sheep were repelled away
from. The players’ goal was to contain the balls (hereafter
referred to as sheep), to the center of a dark gray circle
measuring 19.2 cm in diameter. Each trial lasted one minute
and participants were given the goal of keeping all the sheep
inside the dark gray circle for 70% of the last 45 seconds of
the trial (the first 15 seconds served as time to set up and
corral the sheep). If pairs made it past the 70% threshold
eight times, the experiment ended. Otherwise, pairs

1704

continued to play until the end of the 45 minute
experimental period.
At the start of a trial, the sheep appeared in the center of
the field (see Figure 1c). The sheep moved randomly but
reacted dynamically to the player’s sheepdog location if the
sheepdog was within 10 cm of the sheep. When a player’s
sheepdog was within the sheep’s threatened region, the
sheep would move directly away from the player at a speed
proportional to the inversed distance squared between the
sheep and the player. If one of the sheep managed to hit the
perimeter fence or if all sheep escaped the outer white circle
measuring 29 cm in diameter surrounding the dark grey
circle, then the trial ended without a score. Pairs received
visual feedback regarding their performance at the end of

each trial (i.e., what percentage of time they managed to
keep the sheep within the target area).

Procedure
Following consent, each participant in the pair stood on
either side of an elevated table which displayed the sheep
herding video game from a video projector below the table
onto a frosted glass top. Participants used Polhemus motion
sensors with their right hand in order to control their
sheepdogs. Participants were told to keep the Polhemus
sensors on the table the entire time. The video game was
calibrated so that the sheepdog moved directly underneath
the motion sensor placed on the table. The rules of the game
were described to the participants and participants were also
told that they were not allowed to talk to their partner.

A principle component analysis (PCA) was also
conducted on the players’ movements to determine the
degree to which the coordinated behavior of pairs was
synergistic—the degree of DC—and whether the number of
sheep that needed to be herded had an effect on the strength
of interpersonal synergy formed. PCA is a widely used
statistical technique that identifies covariation within highdimensional datasets and in order to remap the data (taking
the covariation into account) into a space whose axes
(principal components) represent the dataset’s primary
dimensions of variation (Daffertshofer et al., 2004; FornerCordero et al., 2005). Those dimensions, termed the
principal components, can be abstract and need not (and
typically do not) relate directly to the original measurement
dimensions. If the original variables are in fact correlated,
PCA yields a dimension reduction—fewer principal
components are required to account for most of the variance
in the dataset than the number of original variables (i.e.,
provides a measure of DC). Finally, note that for PCA only
successful trials were analyzed. That is, only those trials in
which pairs reached the 70% herding threshold were
analyzed.

Data from the last 45 seconds of each successful trial
(containing the sheep at least 70% for that time) were
analyzed. Of the 45 pairs who participated, one was dropped
from the study because a fire alarm went off during the
experimental session. Thirty-one of the remaining 44 pairs
(70.45%) were able to successfully complete the sheep
herding game before the end of 45 minute experimental
period. All but two of the 31 pairs (eleven [78.57%], nine
[60%] and nine [60%] in the three, five and seven-sheep
conditions, respectively) settled on a specific strategy that
involved performing either a semi-circular in-phase or antiphase oscillatory pattern of behavior (see Figure 2a). Figure
2b, shows time series of two representative examples of
trials illustrating these in-phase and anti-phase movement
strategies. The remaining two pairs who successfully
completed the task both resorted to a strategy that involved
one partner moving in a circular motion rapidly along the
perimeter of the grey circle region where the sheep had to be
contained. This strategy was qualitatively unlike what the
majority of pairs completed, and only involved the actions
of one participant, while the other would stand idly for the
majority of time. Because this latter strategy was different
from the strategy formed by a majority of pairs, and because
their behavior involved individual, and not joint action,
these two pairs were also excluded from analyses.
The stable patterns of coordination that occurred for the
29 pairs retained for analysis was evaluated by calculating
the distribution of relative phase angles formed between the
lateral (left-to-right) movements of the participants along
the game field. These distributions included the percentage
of relative phase angles (calculated using the Hilbert
transform) that occurred within nine 20° regions of relative
phase between 0° and 180°. In-phase and anti-phase
coordination are indicated by a concentration of relative
phase angles near 0◦ and 180◦, respectively. To determine
whether participants engaged in in-phase or anti-phase
oscillatory behavior for a significant proportion of a trial,
1000 random relative phase distributions of the same
sample length to the experimental data were created and
organized into these bins. The 990th largest value for each
bin represented our 0.01 significance level, which was
found to be 12.69% of the total sample length (Varlet &
Richardson, 2015). Each trial was then checked to
determine whether the in-phase bin (0-20°) and/or the antiphase (160-180°) bins were above the 12.69% cutoff (see
Figure 2c for emblematic examples of each). Table 1,
provides a summary of the proportion of trials averaged
across pairs that were statistically classified as either inphase or anti-phase, or exhibit a significant degree of both
in-phase and anti-phase coordination within a trial or no
stable phase relationship. An increase in in-phase behavior
emerges for the 7-sheep condition, with an accompanying
decrease in anti-phase behavior when comparing trials from
the first half of successful trials (1-4) with the second half
(5-8). However, this trend is not significant (Figure 3).

between-subject conditions.

The PCA results are shown in Figure 4. A one-way
between-subject ANOVA, with the number of sheep being
the independent variable, was conducted on the first
principle component to determine whether the number of
sheep had an effect on the proportion of variance that the
first principal component accounted for (i.e., degree of DC).
There was a significant main effect on level, F(2,26) =
12.18, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.48, such that the first principle
component explained significantly more variance in the 7sheep condition than both the 3-sheep (p < 0.001) and 5sheep (p = 0.001) conditions. There was no significant
difference between the 3-sheep and 5-sheep condition (p =
0.34).

Discussion
The goal of the present experiment was to determine: (a)
whether pairs could work together to successfully complete
the sheep herding game; (b) what coordination strategies
would be employed to complete the task; and (c) how task
difficulty (i.e., number of sheep) would influence the
patterning and DC of these coordination strategies.
The results revealed that most pairs quickly learned to
work together to herd the sheep successfully. Moreover,
93.5% of the 31 pairs who were able to complete the game
successfully discovered the same coordination strategies,
categorized by in-phase or anti-phase pattern of movement.
That is, pairs converged on the same two stable states of
coordination known to constrain rhythmic intra- and interpersonal coordination in general (Kelso, 1995; Schmidt &
Richardson, 2008) and predicted by the dynamics of
coupled nonlinear oscillators (Haken et al., 1985). Pairs also
exhibited significantly more in-phase coordination than antiphase coordination, which is consistent with previous
rhythmic coordination research that has consistently found a
relative difference in the inherent stability of in-phase and
anti-phase coordination—in-phase coordination is known to
be more stable than anti-phase coordination (Kelso, 1995;
Schmidt & Richardson, 2008).
With regard to task difficulty, pairs exhibited more inphase patterns of movement coordination in the 7-sheep
condition compared to the 5 and 3 sheep conditions (see
Table 1). This suggests that decreasing the number of sheep
increased the number of perturbations affecting the pair’s
movement dynamics and, thus, resulted in a more
intermittent pattern of in-phase and anti-phase coordination,
as well as a greater number of transitions between antiphase and in-phase coordination. As discussed in more
detail below, this appears to be due to a smaller amount of
sheep co-regulation in the 3- and 5-sheep conditions
compared to the 7-sheep condition. The more robust inphase coordination observed in the 7-sheep condition was
also associated with the greatest amount of DC as measured
by PCA. Recall that dimensional compression, or a
reduction in the number of principle components required to
explain movement variance, provides a measure of synergy
strength. Therefore, finding that a significantly greater
amount of variance was captured by the first principle

component (and second principle component) for the 7sheep condition compared to the 3 and 5 sheep conditions
therefore implies that the behavioral coordination of pairs in
the 7-sheep condition was not only more stable, but also
more synergistic.
As noted above, the reason for this latter finding appears
to be due to the fact that the more tightly coupled and
controlled a pair’s movements were the greater the degree of
co-sheep-regulation. An artifact of the sheep’s’ random
movement behavior was that collisions among sheep caused
their movement to be slower and more collectively
predictable. Thus, a more tightly coupled and robust inphase pattern of movement resulted in a higher probability
of one sheep hitting another sheep, particularly in the 7sheep condition compared to the other conditions. Indeed,
for the 7-sheep condition a more tightly coupled and robust
in-phase pattern of movement coordination more often
resulted in a single slow-moving clump of sheep compared
to the 3 and 5 sheep conditions (although a degree of
clumping did occur in the other conditions). In this sense,
the increased DC observed in the 7-sheep condition not only
produced a greater amount of sheep-to-sheep regulation, but
was also a product of this greater sheep-to-sheep regulation.
Indeed, the clumping behavior seems necessary for the
observed strategy to emerge. Thus, one would expect that
removing the ability for the sheep to collide with one
another (by having them pass through each other), or to
adjust the speed of the sheep to be similar between
conditions, will decrease coupling strength (by making the
task too difficult in the first case, and too easy in the
second).
One intriguing possibility is that the co-regulation that
occurred between the sheep in the 7-sheep condition
provided an environmental scaffold that supported
discovering the oscillatory strategy employed by
participants. If true, future research could explore whether
individuals discovered the stable in-phase and anti-phase
patterns of movement coordination that lead to task success
more quickly the greater the number of sheep. It is
important to appreciate that although no verbal
communication was allowed, in a few instances a participant
would exaggerate their oscillatory movements in what
seemed to be an attempt to communicate with their partner.
In instances where this occurred, their partners did not
immediately alter their behavior in response to these
motions. However, this non-verbal communication would
seem to suggest interpersonal differences in the perception
of stable action possibilities. How and why some
individuals perceived the task solution before others is
therefore another interesting question that could be explored
in future research.
