Abstract
Metronomes, cells, neurons, fireflies, and human beings all
fall into synchrony with each other, given the opportunity.
Synchrony between people appears to generate social
cohesion by increasing liking and feelings of togetherness.
But the function of dancing, chanting and singing is not just to
produce warm, affiliative feelings, anthropologists have
speculated, but also to improve group action. The group that
chants and dances together hunts well together. Direct
evidence for this is sparse, as research so far has mainly
focused on studies of pairs, the effects of bodily movement,
and measured cooperation and affiliative decisions. In
contrast, in our experiment, large groups of people were
studied, the synchrony of their verbal behaviour alone was
manipulated, and in addition to affiliation, we measured their
performance on a memory task and on a group action task,
playing a video game together. Our evidence suggests that the
effects of synchrony are stable across modalities, and can be
generalized to larger groups.

Introduction
Most of us will have experienced the spontaneous
synchronisation of steps when walking next to another
person, audiences clapping in time with each other,
demonstrators chanting together with one voice, or will have
listened to the sound of crickets in perfect harmony.
Synchrony can be found at every scale in the natural world.
For example, cardiac cells fire in synchrony and fireflies
flash in unison (Strogatz, 2003; Cabeza, Rubido, Kahan, &
Marti, 2010); metronomes start to synchronise if put on a
freely moving base (Pantaleone, 2002); neurons synchronise
their activity to allow for coherent percepts and actions
(Singer, 1993); and human beings coordinate their postural
sway during conversation (Shockley, Richardson D.C., &
Dale, 2009), and their movements during a pendulum
swinging task, or while rocking in a chair when visually
coupled (Richardson, Marsh, & Schmidt, 2005). This
suggests that there is a compelling drive for systems to selforganise in synchrony.
Anthropologists and historians have argued for a long
time that ‘keeping together in time’ induces emotional
bonding among human groups with significant
consequences for interaction and cooperation (McNeill,
1995). Marching, dancing, singing, or playing music
together and in unison has been part of human rituals across
all cultures in the world (McNeill, 1995; Codrons, Bernardi,

Vandoni, & Bernardi, 2014) and the idea has been put
forward that coordinating our actions with others is
fundamental and the basis for social connectedness (Marsh,
Richardson, & Schmidt, 2009).
Empirical evidence supports the idea that coordinated
action can function as ‘social glue’ that binds people
together and equips them with the ability to cooperate
(Valdesolo, Ouyang, & DeSteno, 2010). Observing
synchronous movement for example increases perceived
rapport and interpersonal connectedness between people
(Miles, Nind, & Macrae, 2009; Lakens & Stel, 2011);
exposure to synchronous stimulation enhances the degree of
self-other merging (Paladino, Mazzurega, Pavani, &
Schubert, 2010); and active engagement in synchronised
physical and verbal activities boosts actual liking and
cooperation (Hove & Risen, 2009; Wiltermuth & Heath,
2009; Reddish, Fischer, & Bulbulia, 2013).
Most experimental demonstrations of coordinated
behaviour focus on pairs of participants, or more commonly,
a participant and a confederate who has been instructed to
mimic body motions. Nevertheless, it is not hard to see that
synchronous action often happens between many more than
just two or a handful of people. For example, large numbers
of soldiers have been marching in step with one another for
thousands of years (McNeill, 1995).
The impressive breadth and variety of studies
investigating behavioural coordination masks the fact that
there are several fundamental questions about the
phenomena, which are currently unanswered. How do the
effects of coordination scale up from pairs of people to
small and then large groups? Does it matter which aspect of
behaviour is coordinated – speech, posture or gesture – in
order to produce particular psychological effects? Are the
benefits of coordination restricted to social judgements –
attitudes and opinions about other people – or does it also
affect social action and cognition – the ability of people to
perform a dynamic task together?
We decided to focus on chanting, or joint speech, since it
can be observed in every human culture, and as a means of
storing and passing on information, it predates the written
word (Cummins, 2013). It has been speculated that when a
group sings or chants together, this will help to increase
group affiliation and improve the group’s coordination
(McNeill, 1995), and so we measured its effects on action
coordination, affiliation and cognition.

Macbook was connected to a projector, which displayed the
game on a large screen that everyone could see.
In the game, participants saw a man holding a pole,
balancing on a rope (Figure 1). Each time one of the
participants pressed either 1 or 3 on their handset, it sent a
very small nudge to the tightrope walker, sending him to the
left or right. The size of individual nudges depended on the
number of people playing, such that the strength of all
nudges added together would be the same across games with
different numbers of people. The movements of the
tightrope walker were governed by a physics engine that
accounted for the size and position of the figure and the
pole, as well as their momentum. A game ended when the
tightrope walker fell off the rope, or participants
successfully kept him upright for 30 seconds.
The game was made harder by introducing random noise
in the form of tomatoes. They were fired from the sides of
the screen at random and knocked the tightrope walker to
the left or right. The frequency of these missiles was varied
to change the difficulty of the game.
We quantified the success of each game in terms of its
duration and the tightrope walkers average deviation from
the vertical. This allowed us to investigate participants’
perception and evaluation of their own actions under
different levels of difficulty, and develop models of how
they performed the task and responded to each other. For
more description of the game and typical participant
performance, see Richardson, et al., 2011.
Procedure
Participants were randomly allocated to groups, and each
group was assigned to a synchronous (sync) or
asynchronous (async) speech condition. At the start of the
session, participants were given a list of 54 words, split into
three columns. They were told to read them out loud,
completing 2 cycles of the entire list. In the sync condition,
participants were instructed to start at the top of the page
with the first word and read the words together. In the async
condition, participants were told to start at the top of the
first, second, or third column, and participants sat adjacent
to each other always started in different places. They were
told to read out the words at their own preferred speed.
Participants then played the tightrope game. They were
allowed a practice session with no tomatoes being fired as
we explained how they could control the tightrope walker.
Then they played five games with monotonically increasing
rates of tomatoes being fired at them. If the tightrope walker
fell off before 30 seconds, the game was restarted, until
participants were able to complete a total of 30 seconds.
After playing the game, participants were then asked to
fill in a worksheet. In 60 seconds they wrote down as many
of the words as they could remember from the list that they
had read out previously. Then they responded on a 7 point

Results and Discussion
We analysed participants’ responses in the tightrope game,
the memory test and their ratings of group affiliation,
comparing participants in the synchronous with the
asynchronous speech condition.
Tightrope game
We used two levels of analysis to understand performance
on the tightrope game. Firstly, since the participants in each
group were working together, controlling a single tightrope
walker, we analysed the data with each group as a
‘participant’, and the different games as trials. The goal of
the game was to keep the tightrope walker as upright as
possible upright for at least 30 seconds. For the large
majority of the games, participants were successful at
achieving this target duration, and so to discriminate
between games our dependent variable was the average
vertical distance, the angle between the tightrope walker
and the vertical, either tilting to the right or the left. We
computed the average vertical distance across all games and
groups, for different levels of game difficulty and plotted
them in figure 2A. Lower numbers on this measure indicate
a greater success at the task.
To test for differences between conditions, we used
generalised logistic mixed effects models for the average
vertical distances in each game. There were fixed effects for
speech condition and game difficulty level. We specified
random effects for the group with random intercepts. This
full model was compared to a reduced model that did not
include effects for speech condition. We found that the
speech condition did not directly affect the average vertical
angle ((χ2(1)= 0.7372 , p=0.39). Using the same technique,
we found that there was a significant effect of the difficulty
level ((χ2(2)= 9.49, p=0.009), and an interaction between
condition and difficulty level that was not significant, but
perhaps marginally so ((χ2(2)= 4.32, p=0.11). A similar
pattern of significance was found deriving p values using
Satterthwaite’s approximation for degrees of freedom.
Secondly, we analysed the behaviour of individual
participants. For each participant, in each game, we
calculated the average vertical distance of the tightrope
walker from the vertical each time they made a button
response. Figure 2B shows the distribution of average click
distances for the two speech conditions. As before, we used
generalized logistic mixed effects models to account for
fixed effects of difficulty level and speech condition, as well
as random effects from individuals being in different
groups.

2525

By comparing full and reduced models, we again found a
significant effect of the difficulty level ((χ2(2)= 356,
p<.0001), and a significant effect of the interaction between
condition and difficulty level ((χ2(1)= 101.91, p<0.0001).
Here, the effect of speech condition on its own was also
significant ((χ2(1)= 2.7311 , p=0.098).
In summary, there is evidence that reading out the list of
words together had an effect on participants’ behaviour in a
task of group coordination. There was an interaction with
difficultly levels, such that the difference between speech
conditions appeared to be greater in more difficult games.
The evidence was weaker for this conclusion when the
results were modelled at the level of games and groups, but
stronger at the level of an individual’s responses.

Word memory
We scored each participant by the number of words that
they correctly recalled minus the number that they
incorrectly recalled. The distribution of scores between the
synchronous and asynchronous speech conditions is plotted
in Figure 2C. A t-test between the means of these
distributions showed that the participants who read out their
words in synchrony with each other correctly recalled more
words (t (213)= 2.2039, p=0.029).

Affiliation scores
Participants’ ratings of the four affiliation statements were
averaged. The distribution of these scores in the two
conditions are plotted in Figure 2D. The mean of the four
ratings for participants in the synchrony condition (M=8.0,
SD=0.9) was higher than the mean in the asynchrony
condition (M=7.2, SD=1.0). Since the participants were
rating their groups, we needed to take account of the effect
of being in different groups, and used generalized linear
models following our analysis of the tightrope game. Our
model had a fixed effect of condition, and a random effect
of group. Comparing this to a simplified model that just
accounted for group effects, we found that speaking together
for a few minutes, later affected how group members felt
about each other ((χ2(1)= 7.0367, p=0.008). Moreover,
when the ratings for each question were analysed separately
in the same way, all four showed a similar pattern of being
significantly higher in the synchronous condition. Chanting
together in synchrony seems to have similar effects to
moving together in synchrony; people have more positive
feelings towards their group after engaging in collective
speech.

General Discussion
With our experiment we wanted to expand on already
existing synchrony and behavioural coordination literature
in three ways. First, we wanted to see if the affiliative
effects generally reported scale up to larger groups. We
found that members of large groups indeed seemed to feel
closer to each other after they had chanted together in
synchrony. The finding that behavioural synchrony can lead
to interpersonal liking and rapport seems to therefore hold
true also for much larger groups than previously found.
Second, we wanted to investigate if verbal synchrony
alone is sufficient to induce the effects of behavioural
coordination generally observed. Since our groups did not
move together, but sat still during the chanting exercise, we
are confident that verbal synchrony alone is enough to
induce significant changes in participants. Individuals’
ratings of their groups, their affiliation, and their
performance increased in the synchronous condition. Of
course, from this study we are unable to identify exactly
which aspect of synchronous speech was responsible for
changing participants’ behaviour. It could be that chanting
increases affiliation, and thereby improves group
performance. Or perhaps chanting is in itself a pleasant
activity, and so increases motivation, mood and attention to
the tasks at hand. Conversely, speaking out of time with
each other might be aversive, demotivating or simply more
difficult, and as a consequence of differences in task
performance, feelings of group affiliation change. In future
work we hope to separate the different potential effects of
chanting and to investigate their causal connections.
Third, we were curious to see if synchronous behaviour
would also affect action and cognition in addition to the
social effects often observed. A diverse set of researchers
have come to the realisation that perception, action and
cognition cannot be fully understood by investigating single
individuals (e.g., Barsalou, Breazeal & Smith, 2007;
Robbins, & Aydede, 2008; Sebanz, Bekkering & Knoblich,
2006). Studies of situated cognition show that cognition ‘in
the wild’ is intimately linked not only to representations of
the external world, but also to the cognitive processes of
others. For example, Hutchins (1995) observed the ways in
which navy navigators would distribute cognitive processes
between themselves by using external tools and
representations, such as maps and notations. Knoblich and
Jordan (2003) gave a detailed analysis of the way that two
people coordinate their actions: To be successful,
participants had to anticipate both the movements of the
objects in the game and the actions of their partner. More
recently, experimental methods are starting to reveal the
cognitive mechanisms involved in the joint activity of two
people engaged in parallel tasks (Sebanz et al., 2006),
talking to each other (Richardson, Dale & Kirkham, 2007),
or just silently looking at pictures, changing their gaze
patterns because of the knowledge that someone each other
is looking at the same thing (Richardson, et al, 2012).

We wanted to find empirical evidence for the hypothesis
that there is a synchrony-action link, that group members
who have previously synchronized with one another will be
better coordinated in a subsequent task. Our evidence
supports this idea. Groups overall seem to do better on more
coordination tasks after their members have engaged in
synchronous behaviour, at least at the harder levels of task
difficulty. In future experiments we will tease apart how
difficulty level interacts with group synchrony to produce
differing group performance. In this study, however, not
only did we find a synchrony-action link, but also a
synchrony-cognition link: Participants who had chanted
words collectively, rather than reading them out loud by
themselves, remembered more of these words at the end of
the experiment. As with the affiliation findings, this study
does not provide insights into the mechanisms driving the
memory effect. Although synchrony was found to improve
memory performance, the results give no answer as to why
this might be the case. To clearly attribute the effects found
to synchrony and to understand in which ways it affects
memory, will be the task of future studies.
Behavioural coordination is often portrayed as something
that binds people together, a type of ‘social glue’, which
evokes positive and pro-social feelings towards interaction
partners. However, there is more to coordinated joint action
than hugs. For example while synchrony, like mimicry
(Chartrand & Bargh, 1999) often increases rapport and
cooperation, sometimes it has quite different results. In two
studies, Wiltermuth showed that synchrony can lead to
aggression and destructive obedience (2012a; 2012b).
People who had just bonded with one another through
synchronous action were more likely to comply with each
other’s requests, even if those entailed to engage in
aggressive behaviour towards others, such as administering
a noise blast to another group of participants, or killing sow
bugs at a leader’s request (Wiltermuth, 2012a; 2012b).
These studies support the idea that physical synchrony
cannot only lead to pro-social, but also to anti-social and
destructive behaviour. There seems to be a dark side to the
phenomenon, and verbal synchrony seems to have
comparable effects. Spectators at a football game who had
engaged in collective chanting during the game reported
higher levels of aggression than those who had not chanted
(Bensimon & Bodner, 2011).
Anthropologists and historians have long argued that
acting together in time influences group cohesion and group
action. Large groups of people engaged in collective speech
act better together, display improved cognitive functions
and like each other more. Though we have explored the
scope of behavioural coordination in this way, there is one
significant question about the directionality of these effects
we cannot answer with our findings. Does synchrony
increase group affiliation and thereby improve cognition and
action, or does synchrony increase group performance and
this improvement increase the attraction of the group?
