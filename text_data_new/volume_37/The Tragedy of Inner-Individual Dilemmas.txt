On Social and Inner-Individual Dilemmas
Hardin (1968) has pointed out the inevitability of a destruction of public resources by ‘rationally’ acting selfish
individuals. This ‘tragedy of the commons’ refers to selfinterested use of the commons, environmental pollution, and
the destruction of beaches in Spain by competing hotelbuilders. Game theory conceptualizes social dilemmas; for
instance, as prisoner dilemmas or public good games.
Without changing the payoff structure of these games, the
assumed individual (local) optimization will inevitably have
to reduce the payoff/utility for all group members. Although
such a description seems to share with neo-classical economics some broad idea of individualism, the wide-spread
game theoretical description seems to dispense with the neoclassical optimism that assumes that—as by an invisible
hand (Adam Smith)—individual optimization ultimately
leads to a common good.
Recent decades has also led to a lively discussion of several possible solutions of these perhaps not always inevitable tragedies (e.g., Ostrom et al., 1999). In this period,
multi-level approaches in evolutionary biology have cast
doubt on the strict egoism assumption (Sober & Wilson,
1999; Wilson & Wilson, 2007; cf. von Sydow, 2011); and
research in psychology and behavioural economics has
eroded an explicit or tacit egoism assumption and explored
ways people may sometimes resolve or mitigate social
dilemmas (e.g., Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003, 2004). The solution of social dilemmas, however, remains a theoretically
and practically challenging topic of research.

Social dilemmas specify situations in which (local) egoistic
utility optimization prevents achieving the (global) common
good of a group. Tragically, in such dilemmas local optimization also reduces the payoff for the individual optimizer.
Although social dilemmas essentially reflect inter-individual
contexts (conflicting interests, moral attitudes, etc.), innerindividual dilemmas apparently share at least some structural
aspects with them: individual behavior can concern more
conflicting levels of optimization. For example, starting
additional academic projects with potentially positive ‘payoff’
may assume ‘more is more’. However, exogenous effects may
arise from optimizing local goals; further contributions may
incrementally reduce the quality of other contributions and
yield ‘more is less’. In three experiments we explore a oneperson investment game about building hotels, reflecting a
social dilemma. The payoffs involve different optima for local
and global optimization. Results show that people can be
influenced by a default-strategy of ‘more is more’, even if it
is irrational.

Analogous to the normal, two levels of optimization in
‘public good games’, we investigate here inner-individual,
partly analogous dilemmas with potential sacrifice of global
optimization by optimizing the number of pursued local
goals. Individuals aim to maximize their global utility by
achieving several local goals, each with a positive payoff.
Pursuing an additional local goal with positive utility, however, may sometimes reduce the global payoff by negatively
affecting the achievement of other goals. That is, people
may sometimes ignore interactions between goals. Thus we
are concerned with the issue of disregarded external effects
or externalities, not within a group (social dilemmas) but
within an individual (individual dilemmas). People may perhaps often follow a ‘more-is-more’ default strategy/
heuristic, ignoring externalities,even when this affects the
successful achievement of other goals so negatively that
individually local optimization yields overall negative
outcomes.
To illustrate this, we examine an investment game concerned with building hotels. In the domain of social dilemmas, unsustainable hotel-development provides examples of
‘local optimization beats global optimization’. There are
cases—perhaps many—where building hotels may have
successively transformed magnificent beaches, first into
profitable hotel resorts but then into beaches without tourists
but filled aesthetically displeasing hotels. Here interindividual factors loom large: competition, inadequate
regulation, questionable moral behaviour, inadequate
incentives, and poor co-ordination of group interests. And
yet, could not similar dilemmas also occur within a single
person?

Tension between Local and Global
Optimization in the Experiments
This paper investigates individual dilemmas while set in the
context of a social dilemma of hotel-building. The question
is: when one individual owns the whole beach, will he or
she keep building less and less profitable hotels and keep
building hotels even when their number renders the overall
beach less profitable?—We conducted three experiments,
with participants explicitly playing a one-person investment
game, exploring experience-based decision making where
one individual player could build or remove hotels on a
beautiful beach of his or her own.
Payoff structures We investigated different interactions
of payoff per hotel with the number of hotels built on that
beach. Figure 1 shows the average payoffs (we added some
random noise to prevent all hotels’ having exactly the same
payoffs in a given round). On the local level (left side slides
in Figure 1), the average payoffs shown for a single hotel in
both types of payoff conditions were always largest when
one owned three hotels. This formalizes the assumption that,
on the one hand, the hypothetical target group likes some
minimal touristic infrastructure (including, for instance,
fellow tourists). On the other hand, it assumes a dislike of
hotel-skyscraper cities. Additionally, we assume the beach’s
owner had to pay basic land tax even when no hotel is built
(see the resulting negative value when no hotel is built).
Despite the similar aspects, the two local payoff structures
fundamentally differed in their resultant global payoff (right
side of Figure 1). In the more-is-more conditions, the
negative external effects of hotel-building on the payoff
from other hotels are relatively weak. Although the payoff is
half as high with ten hotels as with three, the sum of all
costs and gains continues to increase per number of hotels.
In contrast, in the less-is-more condition, the reduction of
payoff for each hotel is even greater when more hotels have
been built. Although the profit on a single hotel remains
positive even if the beach has ten hotels, the global payoff
resulting from all cost and gains for all hotels is now
reduced by well over a third (right upper slide of Figure 1).
Predictions for the payoff structures What should one
predict for experiments on one-person games with an innerindividual dilemma structure (less-is-more condition)? What
are the normative correct solutions and do they differ from
‘normative’ standards in commonly assumed social dilemmas? This is relevant, if we are investigating whether
participants succumb to irrational decision-strategies in oneperson games in a context reminiscent of social dilemmas.
For social dilemmas, the standard interpretation of game
theory suggests optimizing locally (the outcome of the
individual) at the expense of global optimization (the
outcome of others). This may be considered as a “contextblind” “narrow norm” (Gigerenzer, 1996). At least in some
contexts, ethical norms may appear more reasonable
standards, and, sometimes, even more in accordance with
actual behavior (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2004). Thus one
option might be to replace a game theoretic account by
another norm. Alternatively, one may retain the refined

mathematical apparatus of rational choice theory and game
theory, since its axioms do not require egoism in a
psychological sense. Yet one would have to dismiss the
indeed often implicit general egoism assumption predominant in traditional applications of game theory and
formalize other preference structures and utility functions
accounting for sometimes altruistic (in a way, non-local)
optimization (Fehr & Schmidt, 1999; Fehr & Gächter,
2002). It seems that in both cases these normatively most
interesting questions cannot be derived aprior from the
mathematical core of rational choice theory or game theory.
By contrast, for inner-individual dilemmas, at least in
cases where the goals are evaluated on commensurable
scales, the normative issue appears clear: people should
optimize their overall utility. In our example it can be
rational not to optimize locally the number of hotels built,
but one’s overall payoff from all one’s hotels.
With respect to the two specified payoff structures, we investigate two potential deviations from optimization on the
global level, both relating to a focus on the local level. First,
the optimum at 3 hotels on the local level (left side of Figure
1, both structures) may influence people to build fewer
hotels than is globally optimal (6 in the less-is-more structure; 10 in the more-is-more). We call this a potential ‘local
optimum strategy’. Second, local optimization may
alternatively involve the process of focusing on a positive
payoff for each hotel but ignoring existing (even substantive) negative externalities. In a less-is-more condition,
participants may apply a ‘more-is-more’ default strategy,
thinking more hotels is good, even though actually building
new hotels reduces one’s global payoff.

Experiment 1
Design
Experiment 1 has a two (payoff structure: less-is-more vs.
more-is-more) by two (information presentation format:
local-only vs. local-and-global payoff presentation), withinsubjects design. Thus participants were randomly assigned
one of four conditions:
• C1: less-is-more pay-off, local-only information;
• C2: more-is-more pay-off, local-only information;
• C3: less-is-more pay-off, local and global information;
• C4: more-is-more pay-off, local and global information.
The factor “payoff structures” and corresponding
predictions have been discussed above.
The additional factor information presentation format
varied the accessibility of information. In both cases all
information was in principle available. In the Local-only
format payoff information for each hotel was available only
by clicking on the hotels. Moreover, the global payoff per
round, even here, could be calculated by subtracting the
previous payoff from the present one (although the
experimental procedure did not encourage this). In the localand-global presentation format, one was additionally
provided with explicit and salient global payoff information
for each round. We thought that people in this situation

2518

might act globally optimally, whereas they would not in the
local-only conditions.

Method
Participants 119 students from the University of Göttingen
voluntarily took part, in exchange for either course credits
or money. We analyze here only the 104 participants who
ended the game without being bankrupt. Additionally the
players were informed that they could win money in a
lottery proportionate to their success in the game (with only
one player winning).
Procedure and Material The experiment was a one-person
investment game at a computer, in which participants could
build and remove hotels.
Participants were first given general rules of the game and
the number of rounds of the game. First, one should imagine
having bought a beautiful bay along a coast, to which this
player has sole entitlement. Participants may build hotels in
ten possible areas shown on a map (Figure 2). After clicking
on each building-area/hotel, a screen represents the relative
expenses and income for the place for the corresponding
round. The player’s income is generated with reference to
the payoff-conditions and the given number of built hotels.
The expenses involve only a fixed land tax (−50,000 € per
building ground/round). Additionally the overall payoff for
the hotel was shown, followed by the action-options
available—either building or removing a hotel. Building a
hotel was shown to cost 400,000 €; removing a hotel 200
000 € for the materials. (It was also mentioned, here and in
the introduction, that at the end of the game participants
may liquidate all their hotels into cash, to evaluate their
overall success)

could be negative (up to credit of 2,000,000 €) or positive
(with money automatically transferred if cash was above
1,200,000, as was shown in a pop-up window). In all conditions, the balance of the accounts and the overall money
(cash + bank account) were shown in each round on the
main screen (map). The cash was limited to the building of
hotels; only up to two hotels per round could be built.
By clicking on a button, participants could decide to
proceed to the next round by their own pace. Only then was
the building or removing of hotels implemented. The hotel
symbol shows a concrete high-rise building with palm. In
the global-and-local conditions, an additional pop-up window prominently displayed the overall gain in the round. In
the global-and-local conditions players were additionally
informed about their overall income in each round.

Results and Discussion
Figure 3 shows the mean number of hotels built in all four
conditions and rounds. The results in all conditions show a
clear increase of the average number of hotels up to Round
15, followed by slow increase or constancy up to about
Round 27, and a final decline in the last rounds.
The final decline relates to the possibility for participants
to sell their hotels at the end of the game. As expected, a
higher number of participants in the local-only conditions
were influenced by the idea of selling hotels in the final
round to evaluate their overall success. This may be because
people in the local-only conditions were reminded of this
option more frequently— it was mentioned also on the local
pages.

here with three existing hotels, one hotel to be built, and six
other potential hotel-locations.
The explicit goal of the game was for players to increase
their (overall) money (after 30 rounds). They started with
1,000,000 € cash and 2,000,000 € credit. Apart from the
cash ‘account’ they had a second account, whose balance

The main result of Figure 3 relates to the mean number of
hotels. Although most people in the less-is-more condition
in the later rounds had gone through phases with clearly
higher local payoff (since for each round they could build
two hotels at most), peoples’ decisions led to hotel numbers
clearly above the optimal value of six. Moreover, in the
local-only conditions there was to no significant difference
between less-is-more and more-is-more conditions. Participants in line with our second prediction (a more-is-more

2519

strategy) in this condition seem unable to account for interactions (mutual exogeneities) if provided with information
on the local level only. Alternatively, they could have
summarized/estimated the local information, or calculated it
from differences of the overall money between rounds.
Even in the global-and-local information condition, we
obtained almost the same high average numbers of hotels
built for the less-is-more condition (C2); even if provided
with focal information about the global payoff, and having
experienced a phase with notably higher payoffs (earlier
rounds), the average number of hotels remained significantly higher than the optimal six hotels. There was no large
difference in the mean to the more-is-more condition
(normative value of 10).

Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1 and investigated
the same payoff conditions. However, it involved 50 rounds
instead of 30 to test further the temporal stability of the
phenomenon. Second, in Experiment 2 storms were added
to the program, which could destroy some hotels. Although
previously the successive building of hotels (maximally two
each round) forced people to go through the area of
substantially higher global payoff (in a less-is-more
condition) at least once, this may have prevented them from
experiencing jumping between different hotel numbers.
Storms led to a sudden reduction in hotel numbers. Thus
participants who ultimately built 10 hotels repeatedly
experienced that building involved going from higher to
lower payoff zones. Third, Experiment 3 only concerns two
conditions rather than four. We focused on the local-andglobal conditions (with global payoff), which had
previously led to the best differentiation between the less-ismore and more-is-more conditions. (We retain the
numbering of these conditions as C3 and C4, despite
skipping C1 and C2).

the maximum of 10 hotels (optimum for the more-is-more
conditions); orange, the number of 6 hotels (optimal for the
less-is-more conditions).
The results of Figure 4 suggest four points. First, participants do not seem to care for the local optimum of 3 hotels
at all. This clearly disconfirms the first considered hypothesis, the ‘local optimum strategy’ even for the local-only conditions. Second, and in line with the second local strategy,
the ‘more-is-more’ hypothesis, the high average hotel
number for all conditions seems explainable to some extent
by a high number of maximally allowed buildings (10) in all
conditions. Third, the optimal proportion for the less-ismore-condition (6 hotels) is only slightly higher in these
conditions than in the more-is-more conditions (with an
optimum of 10 hotels). Finally, in the local-and-global
conditions there is a considerably higher number of 10hotels occurrences than in the corresponding more-is-more
condition (at least in later rounds).
Overall, the results of this experiment appear inconsistent
with the first local strategy discussed (the local optimum
strategy)—people appear not to be influenced by the highest
payoff on the local level as long as the payoff is positive.
However, the results deviate clearly from optimizing and are
coherent with the second local strategy (the ‘more-is-more’
strategy). In line with the latter strategy, at least a part of the
participants seems to ignore exogeneities; building more
hotels appears positive to them, even if some hotels, each
with a positive local payoff, clearly had considerably more
detrimental than favorable overall affects.

Participants 77 participants from the University of

randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. 66 ended

obtained either course credits or money, and they could
participate in a lottery (cf. Experiment 1).
Material and procedure Apart from the already cited
differences in material and procedure, Experiment 2 was
largely identical to Experiment 1. Storms occurring in
rounds 25/26 and 38/39 normally destroyed three hotels, but
if one only owned 1 to 3 hotels, only 1 hotel was destroyed.
Participants got all money back they spend in the destroyed
hotel (due to a insurance). Some minor changes were made,
such as increasing the divisor for the gained fictive money
to determine the price in the lottery (given the larger number
of rounds, this kept the incentive more constant).

participants demonstrate problems detecting externalities,
involving a clear reduction of payoffs.

Results and Discussion

Participants 137 from the University of Heidelberg voluntarily took part, with the same incentives as in Experiments
1 and 2. 117 ended the game without going bankrupt. Again,
we confine our analysis to these participants.
Material and Procedure The material and procedure for
Experiment 3 are largely identical to those for Experiment
2. The instruction was aimed at increasing the plausibility of
a potential interaction hypothesis between number of hotels
and payoff. After mentioning the possibility of several
influences on the payoff, the following was added: “House
building may for instance increase or also decrease the
attractivity of the hotels […]”. The text was set in bold print
(the only bold print in this paragraph). 2

Figure 5 shows the proportion of hotels that had been built
in the 50 rounds of Experiment 2.

Experiment 3
Experiment 3 was highly similar to Experiment 2, with two
main differences. First, it is explicitly and saliently
suggested in the introduction that the number of hotels
might be positive or also negative. Second, we investigated
the full set of four conditions (as in Experiment 1) but
employed 50 rounds, with 2 storms (as in Experiment 2).

Method

Results and Discussion

Figure 5: The proportion of hotel occurrences over the 50
rounds for the two global-and-local conditions run in
Experiment 2 only.
Similar to Experiment 1, a surprisingly high proportion of
10-hotel occurrences remains in both conditions. As
predicted, however, there seem to be fewer 10-hotel occurrences in the less-is-more condition than in the more-ismore condition. Nonetheless, there remains to be only a
very low number of correct 6-hotel occurrences (or a similar
number of occurrences) in the less-is-more condition.
Thus, even after adding the storm manipulation, a
substantial proportion of participants in the less-is-more
condition built too many hotels even in late rounds (e.g.,
R47). 1 Even with repeated experience that more hotels lead
to lower payoff—and given clear global payoff
information— it seems the more-is-more strategy stills plays
a role in this less-is-more environment. Despite descriptive
improvement between experiments, a relevant portion of

Figure 6, as with analogous figures in the previous Experiments, provides detailed information about the relative
frequency of hotels build in the conditions and phases.
The results at least suggest the following. Over all
conditions, the use of a partly unwarranted ‘more-is-more’
heuristic’ seems less frequent (here generally linked to 10hotel occurrences after hotels could be built up).
Furthermore, the comparison of the two local-and-global
information conditions (full information) shows testable
differences between conditions, in a direction coherent with
optimal decisions: in the less-is-more condition, particularly
after the second storm, people favor about as many correct
6-hotel occurrences as 10-hotel occurrences. This is clearly
not the case in the more-is-more condition (if one for
instance tests these frequencies against each other in one
round, e.g. R48, this yields significant results, exact fourfield test, p < .01). People may have become increasingly influenced by the observed data. No such clear differentiation
is found between the two local-only information conditions.
Participants here do not seem to distinguish the local and the
global payoff conditions. Nor do they seem clearly influenced by the ‘local optimum strategy’, favoring 3 hotels. A
mixture of strategies, however, cannot be ruled out.

1

Due to an instruction error, according to which the overall number of
rounds was at one point mentioned to be 30 instead of 50, this presumably
caused some people (few) to sell several hotels at this time. As in Experiment 1 this did not play a significant role for the local-and-global
conditions.

2
Another minor change was that we did not mention the option of
removing hotels in the introduction in connection with winning money in a
real lottery, but only on the local pages of places were hotels were built.

2521

ruled out the adequacy of a different unwarranted local
strategy, the local optimum strategy. Experiment 2 appears
to show this even for more rounds and after repeatedly forcing participants to experience a negative relation between
number of hotels and payoff. Experiment 3 added an
explicit instruction, encouraging an externality hypothesis.
Here finally the more-is-more strategy seems to play a
smaller role, but this likewise only lead to a partial cure.
Particularly, in conditions with only local feedback, people
remain to have difficulties integrating their local knowledge.
The present research is not conclusive and raises many
further questions. Notably, beyond the need for some clarification of some aspects of our results, the line of research
opens up interesting new avenues. The formulation of innerindividual dilemmas in a broad analogy to social dilemmas
may inspire research that may connect game theory, self-regulation (e.g., Baumeister & Vohs, 2004), causal decision
making (e.g., Robinson, et al. 2010; Hagmayer & Meder,
2013), and the learning of interactions (e.g., Novick &
Cheng, 2004).

General Discussion
Overall, the results support the idea that there are innerindividual dilemmas that lead to optimizing local goals at
the expense of global optimization. People can have
substantial difficulties seeing mutual externalities (systematic negative side-effects of a class of positive effects)
with regard to one’s own payoffs. Such individual dilemma
situations were studied here using the example of hotelbuilding, a context where analogous social dilemmas are
well known; local optimization of over-building (whether
too many or too high), can have detrimental effects on optimization at a higher level (e.g., tourist income for a city). In
the social context this has not only been discussed by the
media but has even led to regulations in several countries.
(In Bali, for instance, it is forbidden to build new hotels
taller than palm trees.)
For the inner-individual dilemmas studied here, Experiment 1 suggested that participants tend to follow a more-ismore strategy even in less-is-more situations. This was even
the case when people were provided with salient information about global payoffs. Furthermore, Experiment 1
