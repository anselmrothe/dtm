Abstract

novel syllables are presented in triads following a different
rule (novel trials; e.g., ABA, ba-po-ba). If infants learned
the rule in training, they should discriminate familiar from
novel test trials, as evidenced by a reliable preference for
one type of trial over the other. Critically, the stimuli are
designed so that any such preference requires that infants
represent the abstract relations within the triads and not
simply lower-level perceptual features that might otherwise
be common to both the familiarization and test stimuli.
Using this design, Marcus and colleagues found that 7month-olds reliably learned abstract rules from speech
syllables (Marcus et al., 1999). This remarkable finding
sparked a wave of interest in infants’ abstract rule learning
from auditory stimuli more generally. These pursuits have
revealed a host of insights documenting, for example, that
within the first year, infants’ rule learning is gradually tuned
to speech syllables (Dawson & Gerken, 2009; Marcus,
Fernandes, & Johnson, 2007) and to other communicative
signals (Ferguson & Lew-Williams, 2014), that rulelearning benefits from vowel and consonant redundancies in
spoken syllables (Thiessen, 2012), that infants can learn
both adjacent (i.e., repetition) and non-adjacent relations
(Gervain & Werker, 2012), that the amount of variability
present in the stimuli influences the kind of rule infants will
abstract (Gerken, 2006; Kovács, 2014), that infants can
learn a rule from a single exemplar (Gerken, Dawson,
Chatila, & Tenenbaum, 2014), that infants can even
simultaneously learn word- and sentence-level rules from
speech (Kovács & Endress, 2014), and that even newborns
detect certain repetition-based rules (Gervain, Berent, &
Werker, 2012; Gervain, Macagno, Cogoi, Peña, & Mehler,
2008).
Considerably fewer studies have investigated infants’
ability to learn abstract rules when stimuli are presented in
the visual modality. Moreover, the evidence reported to date
does not yet offer a clear picture of the conditions that best
support this learning. For example, Johnson and colleagues
(2009) examined visual rule learning in 8- and 11-montholds. The design was identical to Marcus et al. (1999)’s
studies, except that instead of listening to sequences of
speech syllables, infants viewed a series of sequentiallypresented two-dimensional shapes looming on a screen. For
example, an infant familiarized to an ABB rule might see
triangle-circle-circle as one sequence. The results were
mixed: Eleven-month-olds successfully learned AAB and
ABB rules, but failed to learn ABA rules. Eight-month-olds
fared even worse, learning ABB rules but neither AAB or
ABA. This was interpreted as evidence that infants’ ability

Infants’ ability to detect and generalize abstract rules (e.g.,
ABB, ABA) in auditory stimuli has been well documented,
however their ability to do so from visual stimuli has received
considerably less attention. Moreover, the few studies
reported suggest that this kind of learning is especially
sensitive to details of the experimental design. Here, we focus
on 3- to 4-month-old infants (N=40) to identify both the
origins of visual abstract rule learning in infancy and the
conditions that best support it. Our results provide the earliest
evidence to date, documenting that by 3 months of age,
infants successfully learn and generalize rules in the visual
modality. They also reveal that providing infants with an
opportunity to examine the stimuli simultaneously may be
instrumental to their success.

Introduction
A signature of human cognition is our ability to learn and
represent abstract relations (Penn, Holyoak, & Povinelli,
2008). For example, in language, we learn not only about
abstract grammatical categories (i.e., nouns, verbs), but also
about the hierarchical relations that govern their usage
(Chomsky, 1965; Jackendoff, 1990; Pinker, 1984). And, in
science, we learn not only about the protons, electrons, and
neutrons that make up atoms, but also about the relations
among them and, further still, the similarity between these
relations and those of other systems (e.g., the solar system;
Gentner, 1983). Even our fundamental notions of identity –
SAME and DIFFERENT – rely on this capacity for relational
thinking.
The importance of abstract relations to human cognition
has led researchers to investigate their developmental
origins. In a seminal study, Marcus and colleagues asked
whether infants as young as 7 months could learn a
particular kind of relation, commonly known as an “abstract
rule” (Marcus, Vijayan, Rao, & Vishton, 1999). To do so,
they devised a now-standard rule learning paradigm in
which infants are exposed to triads of speech syllables
following a single rule. For example, an infant learning an
ABB rule would be familiarized to sequences such as le-didi, wi-je-je, and de-li-li. Next, to test whether they learned
this rule, infants hear a series of test trials composed of
novel speech syllables. On half of the test trials, these novel
syllables are presented in triads following the rule to which
they had been exposed during the learning phase (familiar
trials; e.g., ba-po-po); on the remaining test trials, these

to learn rules in the visual domain is considerably less
robust that in the auditory domain and, in particular, from
speech.
Other studies using different experimental designs have
reported more successful rule learning. For example, two
studies found that 5- and 7-month-olds reliably learned rules
when a single rule was presented simultaneously in the
auditory and visual modalities (i.e., presenting a visual
sequence, triangle-circle-circle in conjunction with an
auditory sequence, bo-pa-pa; Frank, Slemmer, Marcus, &
Johnson, 2009; Thiessen, 2012). Another study found that 7month-olds reliably learned rules from images of familiar
stimuli (dogs and cats) were presented sequentially and then
remained together briefly on the screen (allowing infants to
observe the sequence in its entirety; Saffran, Pollak, Seibel,
& Shkolnik, 2007).
We suspect that two features of Saffran et al.’s (2007)
design supported infants’ rule learning, permitting their 7month-olds to succeed where Johnson et al.’s (2009) 8month-olds had failed. First, in Saffran et al. (2007), the
rules were instantiated in images of dogs and cats; these
may have been easier process, and perhaps more interesting,
than Johnson et al.’s (2009) geometric shapes. Second, in
Saffran et al. (2007), once an image appeared, it remained
on the screen until all images in the triad had appeared; and
after the final image appeared, the entire triad remained
visible for almost a second. Why might this latter
presentation style best support rule learning? First,
permitting each image to remain on the screen meant that
infants did not need to remember each image in sequence in
order to detect the rule. In contrast, the greater memory
requirement in Johnson et al. (2009) may have taxed infants’
limited visual working memory which, even by 6 months,
can maintain a representation of only a single object (Kwon,
Luck, & Oakes, 2014; Ross-Sheehy, Oakes, & Luck, 2003;
see also Frank & Tenenbaum, 2011 for computational-level
discussion of memory demands in rule learning). Second,
having the images remain on the screen may also facilitate
their comparison of the images which in turn should
facilitate their abstraction of the rule (Ferry, Hespos, &
Gentner, in press; Gentner & Markman, 1997; Gentner &
Medina, 1998; Oakes & Ribar, 2005).
In the present study, our primary goal was to ask whether
infants at just 3 to 4 months of age could successfully learn
visual abstract rules under these more supportive conditions1.
To do so, we adapted the experimental design introduced by
Saffran et al. (2007), presenting triads composed of dog
images sequentially, but permitting each image to remain

1

While one study by Addyman and Mareschal (2010)
concludes that 4-month-olds have the ability to represent at
least one of the prerequisite abstract relations (DIFFERENT)
required for this task, learning a rule requires not only
detecting this relation but also encoding its location in a
sequence. Thus it is still an open question whether infants
this age can learn rules from visual modality.

visible for the duration of each sequence and briefly
thereafter.
Our second goal was to extend this design to identify the
influence of infant-directed speech on visual rule learning at
3-4 months. Several recent studies have converged to
suggest that infant-directed speech and other communicative
signals promote young infants’ learning (Csibra & Gergely,
2009; Ferguson & Lew-Williams, 2014; Ferguson &
Waxman, 2013; Ferry, Hespos, & Waxman, 2010; Kuhl,
2007; Marcus et al., 2007; Vouloumanos & Waxman, 2014;
Wu, Gopnik, Richardson, & Kirkham, 2011; Wu,
Tummeltshammer, Gliga, & Kirkham, 2014; Yoon, Johnson,
& Csibra, 2008). For example, in one study at 3- and 4months, infants failed to form object categories while
listening to tones, yet they succeeded in the very same task
while listening to speech (Ferry et al., 2010). To ascertain
whether speech might also facilitate visual rule learning at
this age, for half of the participants, each triad of dogs was
presented in conjunction with a phrase of infant-directed
speech; for the remaining infants, the triads were presented
in silence. All infants were tested in silence. If speech
facilitates infants’ visual abstract rule learning, then those
infants listening to speech during the learning phase should
be more successful in detecting abstract rules.

Methods
Participants
We tested 40 3- to 4-month-old infants (17 F; M = 4.18
months, range 3.00 – 4.97) recruited from Evanston, IL,
USA and the surrounding area. Each participant was
assigned to either the Speech (N = 20) or Silent (N = 20)
condition. An additional 26 infants (13 in each condition)
were excluded due to either irritability that forced the
experiment to end before the test phase (N = 14), irritability
during test (N = 1), looking on fewer than 2 trials of each
rule type (N = 7), technical error (N = 3), or parental
interference (N = 1).

Procedure
We designed the task to match that of Saffran et al. (2007),
and therefore included a Habituation and a Test phase.
During Habituation trials, all infants saw triads of dog
images on a screen that each followed the same rule (either
ABB or ABA, randomized between-subjects). Each dog
appeared in sequence, in 330ms intervals and remained
visible thereafter. All three then remained on the screen
together for 1840ms following the third dog’s appearance2,
during which time infants in the Speech condition heard a
phrase of infant-directed speech and infants in the Silent
2

We extended the simultaneous viewing period for 1s
longer than in Saffran et al. (2007) because it catered to the
slower visual processing speed of younger infants and gave
us the time required to present the Speech stimuli while
infants viewed the triads in their entirety.

693

condition observed the triads in silence. A blank screen
separated each triad by 500ms. Triads continued to be
displayed in this manner until infants looked away from the
screen for 2s; at this point, the trial ended and infants saw an
attention-getter presented at the center of the screen. When
infants looked to the attention-getter for 250ms, a new
habituation trial began. This continued until infants
habituated, which occurred either when their trial looking
time (averaged across the three consecutive trials) fell below
50% of their mean looking time during the first three trials,
or when infants had viewed the maximum number (25) of
habituation trials (only two infants hit the maximum).
After Habituation, the Test phase began. The Test phase
included 8 trials. In each, infants viewed triads comprised of
entirely novel dog images. In 4 of the trials, the dogs formed
an ABB pattern while, in the other 4 trials, the dogs formed
an ABA pattern, thus resulting in trials that matched either
the familiar (habituated) rule or a novel rule. Trials were
presented in two blocks of four; within each block, the order
of familiar rule and novel rule trials was randomized.
Within each trial, each triad had the same timing as during
Habituation and, for all infants, were presented in silence.
Test trials lasted until infants looked away for 2s.

test, were shown trials in which new dogs were organized to
follow the familiar rule or a novel rule (e.g., ABA).
Auditory Immediately after the appearance of the third
image in each triad, infants in the Speech condition heard
one of two phrases, “Look at the toma!” and “Do you see
the toma?” (adapted from Balaban & Waxman, 1997; Ferry
et al., 2010; Waxman & Markow, 1995). Although for older
infants, naming phrases like these direct infants’ attention to
commonalities among objects (Fennell & Waxman, 2010;
Namy & Waxman, 2000), infants at 3-4 months do not yet
reliably segment individual words from the speech stream
(Bortfeld, Morgan, Golinkoff, & Rathbun, 2005; Seidl,
Tincoff, Baker, & Cristia, 2014). These phrases were prerecorded and played from speakers beneath the screen.

Coding
Using custom MATLAB software, each infant’s looking
time to the screen was coded online by a trained observer
blind to the study’s hypotheses.

Analyses
Our dependent measure was each infant’s mean looking
time to the screen during novel and familiar trials at Test.
Our prediction is that, if infants learn the rule during
Habituation, they will discriminate novel from familiar test
trials. In most studies, infants who learn the rule look longer
during novel trials. However, in some studies that have
tested learning under particularly difficult conditions,
infants look longer during familiar trials (Gerken et al.,
2014; Thiessen, 2012). Given the very young age of our
participants and nature of the task, we considered both a
priori possibilities and thus used two-tailed statistical tests
throughout. In contrast, if infants failed to learn the rule, we
predicted that there would be no differences between
looking during familiar and novel trials.
We excluded all test trials in which infants looked less
than 2.5 seconds (the length of one sequence) to be sure that
infants discriminated novel from familiar sequences (57
trials, 17% of total). (Including these trials does not change
the pattern of results or significance of p-values reported
below.)
Preliminary analyses revealed that neither the infants’ sex
nor the rule that they were habituated to (ABB or ABA)
predicted looking preferences at test (all p’s > .32); we
therefore collapsed across these factors in further analyses.

Stimuli
Visual The dog images were identical to those of Saffran et
al. (2007) and organized into the same A and B categories.
During habituation, the A elements were the Alaskan
Malamute, Norwegian Elkhound, Shiba Inu, and Nova
Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, and the B elements were the
Australian Cattle Dog, Belgian Malinois, Canaan Dog, and
German Shepherd. During test, the A elements were the
Finnish Spatz and Akita, and the B elements were the
Anatolian Shepherd and Belgian Tervuren.

Results
In a preliminary set of analyses, our goal was to ascertain
whether infants (1) habituated during the Habituation phase
and (2) dishabituated at Test. First, to assess habituation, we
compared infants’ attention during the first three habituation
trials to their attention during the final three habituation
trials (see Figure 2). Infants’ attention did indeed decline,
t(39) = 6.52, p < .001. There were no differences between
conditions in either the time to habituate (silent: M =
137.06s, speech: M = 115.62s, p = .33) or the trial number

Figure 1: Representative stimuli. Infants were habituated to
triads of dogs all following the same rule (e.g., ABB) and, at

694

on which they habituated (silent: M = 10.55, speech: M =
8.80, p = .27). Second, to assess whether infants
dishabituated at test (when the new images of dogs were
introduced), we compared infants’ mean looking during the
final three habituation trials to their mean looking during
test trials. Indeed, infants did dishabituate overall (M
difference = 2.93s, p = .033).
This outcome, which provides assurances that infants at
least noticed the new images presented at test, permitted us
to address our primary questions: At test, did infants
distinguish between the familiar and novel rules? And did
their ability to do so differ between the Speech and Silent
conditions? To address these questions, we entered infants’
looking times at test into a 2 (Condition: Speech, Silent) x 2
(Trial Type: Novel, Familiar) ANOVA. We found a reliable
main effect of Trial Type (F(1,38) = 6.49, p= .015) but no
main effect of Condition (F(1,38) = .008, p = .93) and no
interaction (F(1,38) = .27, p = .61). A follow-up t-test
confirmed that, overall, infants looked significant longer at
familiar test trials (M = 10.56s, SD = 9.29) than novel test
trials (M = 7.80s, SD = 4.20), t(39) = -2.57, p = .014, d = .41. A non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test
corroborated the direction and significance of this
preference, p = .029, as did infants’ dishabituation patterns
at Test: Infants reliably dishabituated to familiar rule trials
(M = 4.30s, p = .016) but not to novel rule (M = 1.55s, p
= .16) trials.
These results indicate that infants in both conditions
learned the abstract rule during Habituation and, critically,
generalized this rule to the novel stimuli at Test. Because
there was no interaction between Trial Type and Condition,
infants’ learning did not differ between Speech and Silent
conditions.
Two features of infants’ performance warrant further
comment. First, notice that in both conditions, infants
preferred the test trials depicting the familiar rule to those
depicting the novel rule. This suggests that detecting the
rule in these visual stimuli was cognitively demanding and
thus required further attention and processing (Colombo &
Bundy, 1983; Roder, Bushnell, & Sasseville, 2000). Given
that several rule learning studies with 7-month-olds have
reported familiarity preferences (e.g., Gerken et al., 2014;
Thiessen, 2012), it is perhaps unsurprising that these 3- and
4-month-olds revealed their learning in the same manner.
Second, it is clear from Figure 3 that the magnitude of
infants’ familiarity preference decreases with age. This
effect of age was confirmed in a linear model predicting
infants’ difference scores at test by age, condition, and their
interaction. This model revealed a reliable intercept (i.e., a
reliable overall familiarity preference; β = -2.88, t(36) = 2.85, p = .0072), a significant effect of age (β = 5.08, t(36) =
2.85, p = .0071), and no effect of condition or interaction
between age and condition, both p’s > .38. This effect of age
– in which younger infants (i.e., slower processors) had
larger familiarity preferences than older infants (i.e., faster
processors) – is exactly what is predicted by existing

habituation trials (Hab1-3), the last three habituation trials

accounts of familiarity and novelty preferences (e.g.,
Colombo & Bundy, 1983). With time, infants become faster
processors and thus more likely to show novelty preferences
in the same tasks in which they once showed familiarity
preferences. Moreover, this proposed trajectory is plausible
because by at least 7 months, infants show novelty
preferences with these same stimuli (Saffran et al., 2007).

Discussion
We have revealed for the first time that infants as young as
3 months of age can learn abstract rules from visual stimuli.
Together with findings from auditory rule learning (e.g.,
Gervain et al., 2008), these findings suggest that the

695

foundations of one signature of human cognition – our
capacity for detecting relations - are in place early within
the first months of life and, moreover, able to operate over
both auditory and visual modalities.
Moreover, we found that visual rule learning at this age
was robust both while listening to speech and in silence.
Nevertheless, the cognitive advantages of human speech and
other communicative signals may be apparent under more
taxing learning conditions. By manipulating features of the
present design (e.g., habituation time, visual stimuli), further
research can better clarify what advantages, if any, speech
and other communicative signals have on early abstract rule
learning.
Communicative contexts aside, these findings lay the
groundwork for an even broader investigation into the
conditions that best support very young infants’ relational
abstraction in rule learning tasks. Comparing the present
study (in which 3- and 4-month-olds learned abstract rules
in the visual domain) with that of Johnson et al. (2009; in
which 8-month-olds failed to learn in all but one case), we
suggest that two critical paths for future investigation will
be to assess the contribution of: (1) the kind and complexity
of visual stimuli presented (e.g., dogs versus shapes) and,
(2) the way in which these stimuli are presented (e.g., with
each image available for only a brief inspection versus
allowing for simultaneous comparison).
We suspect that the conditions that best support rule
learning are likely to differ across modalities and stimuli.
For example, although we have suggested that allowing
infants an opportunity to view the images in each triad
simultaneously (albeit briefly) may have been instrumental
to their success here and in Saffran et al. (2007), this does
not guarantee that simultaneous comparison will always be
essential in rule learning, even within the visual modality.
On the contrary, we suspect that it will not be required for
infants to learn rules from sequences of actions that, by their
nature, are temporally ordered and cannot occur
simultaneously. Furthermore, existing evidence from rule
learning from speech and tones (Dawson & Gerken, 2009;
Marcus et al., 1999) documents that, in the auditory
modality, infants can learn rules when individual elements
are presented only in sequence. Indeed, harmonics aside,
this temporal property is a requirement of this modality. We
therefore propose that what allows infants to detect an
abstract relation and learn a rule may vary, both as a
function of the endowments of the perceptual modality and
the properties of the particular stimuli themselves.
