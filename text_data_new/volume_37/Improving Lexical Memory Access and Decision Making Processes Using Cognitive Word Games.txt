Abstract
Strengthening semantic and orthographic associations among
words in a lexicon may help to improve memory processes
related to fluent organizing and retrieval of language. In the
present study, we examined how training in several different word games impacts later retrieval access for the words.
Games included a word-stem completion task (orthographic),
a free association task (semantic), and a crossword paradigm
task (orthographic+semantic). A within-subject experiment
was used to compare the relative effectiveness of these three
training methods on a lexical association task performed prior
to and following training. Results showed that the games were
able to improve participants’ decision times, and the increased
fluency in the lexical association task due to the free association task was greater than the other games. We will further
apply and examine this study with non-native English speakers.

Lexical Memory Access as a Recognitional
Decision Process
Previous research on lexical memory has often focused on
how information is stored and organized in long-term memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1969), as well as on aspects
of memory retrieval, search, and forgetting (e.g. McGeoch,
1932; Underwood, 1957). When considering language as
a domain of expertise (Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995), it is perhaps unmatched in terms of its size and complexity, containing thousands of words, rules, grammatical forms, and associations used for communication (Miller, 1972; Nickerson,
1977). Although most traditional studies of recognition and
recall (e.g. Anderson & Bower, 1972; Brown & McNeill,
1966; Shiffrin, 1970) use linguistic material to assess performance, they typically have not examined linguistic memory
from the context of expert knowledge retrieval, and so may
miss important similarities in these domains.
Research on expertise is another approach to understand
linguistic memory processes. Mueller and Thanasuan (2013)
studied crossword experts’ puzzle-solving abilities and developed the computational models based on the RecognitionPrimed Decision (RPD) models (Klein, 1993; Klein, Calderwood, & Clinton-Cirocco, 1986) and the Bayesian Recognitional Decision Making (BRDM) model (Mueller, 2009),
which itself was adapted from the REM models of human
episodic memory (Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997). These models
were able to explain aspects of decision making and problem

solving based on simple lexical memory representations of
the clues and answers found in past puzzles. Subsequently,
Thanasuan and Mueller (2014) examined the strategic contributors to expert crossword play by adapting the model
to actually solve complete puzzles with abilities similar to
crossword experts. Consequently, this research has demonstrated strong connections between theories of memory, problem solving, and expert decision making.

Cognitive Word Games as Language Training
As a consequence of this research, we have begun examining
how word games might be used to improve lexical memory
access, as well as to establish evidence for effective training strategies. Word games offer potential benefits, as they
are engaging, they allow repetition, and they may be able to
strengthen memory access routes that are not used in more
traditional methods. Crossword and other similar word games
are frequently used as language and vocabulary building exercises, both in second-language classrooms and in specific
disciplines requiring a specialized vocabulary. Furthermore,
Read (1998) has used similar tasks as a validated test for nonnative English speakers, and found the tasks were good for
assessing depth of vocabulary knowledge.
We hypothesize that lexical memory access may be enhanced by increasing either (or both) semantic and orthographic associations among words in a lexicon (see Figure
1). Different word games may selectively enhance different
associations (see Figure 2), and better overall fluency may be
promoted using games that enhance both routes.
To test this hypothesis, we selected three word games: a
word-stem completion task; a free association task; and a
crossword task. As an outcome measure, we developed task
assessing lexical associations, which was assessed both prior
to and following practice. In addition, we also collected some
baseline data on cognitive abilities (in the form of a reading
span task and a matrix reasoning task), to assess how general
cognitive skills were related to performance.

Design, Materials and Stimuli
Forty English words were selected from the book “Words
for Students of English: A Vocabulary Series for ESL Vol.
1-7” (Pitt Series in English As a Second Language), stratified across seven different levels from beginning to advanced
learners. The words were randomly assigned into one of
four groups (10 words per group) and these four word groups
(1,2,3 and 4) were assigned to the four training conditions via
a Latin Square, as shown in Table 1. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four training groups, so that each
participant experienced every training condition. The conditions were composed of a control group (no learning), a wordstem completion task, a free association task, and a crossword
paradigm task. The task details are shown in the following
sections. Software from the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) test battery (Mueller & Piper, 2014)
was used to collect data from the survey, matrix reasoning,
and reading span tasks. The remaining tasks were conducted
via a web browser.

Baseline Tasks
Participants were asked to perform the reading span task and
the reasoning task at the beginning of the study. The reading
span task was used to measure participants’ working memory
span and their reading ability. The reasoning task was used to
assess intelligence and reasoning ability.
Reading Span Task The reading span task that we used in
this study was originally conducted by Daneman and Carpenter (1980) and adapted by Unsworth, Redick, Heitz, Broadway, and Engle (2009). The goal of this task was to recall a
set of unrelated letters, consisting of F, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q,
R, S, T and Y. Participants were required to read a sentence,
validate whether it is logical and memorize a letter presented
after the judgment. The letter appeared for 1000 ms. The participants had to recall letters in a correct order. There were
three trials of each set size between three to seven letters, for
a maximum possible total of 75 letters to be recalled. The
score was computed based on the number of correct letters in
the correct positions and orders. This task took 15 minutes.
Reasoning Task A novel matrix reasoning task based on
Raven’s Raven and Court (1998) progressive matrices was
used to measure participant reasoning ability in this study.
This version used stimuli developed and discussed by Matzen
et al. (2010). The types of shape transformations include
shape change, shading change, orientation change, size
change and number change. One, two or three types of shape
combinations were given to participants in each trial. Their
task was to identify the missing patterned shape that completed the matrix pattern. There was a total of 43 test problems and two practices at the beginning of the test. Participants had 15 minutes to complete all problems.

Lexical Association Task
The lexical association task was completed both prior to and
following word game training. It was used to assess memory access process. On each trial, participants saw a target
word along with four possibly related choice words. Their
task was to determine which one of these cues was meaningfully related or strongly associated to the target word. All
cues except the correct answer were selected at random from
the Brown corpus (Kuĉera & Francis, 1967) and the Free As-

2357

sociation Norms (Nelson, McEvoy, & Schreiber, 1998). The
test was comprised of 40 problems that took ten minutes to
complete. The target word and the correct answer were the
same for the pre-test and post-test, but the other word cues
and positions were changed randomly. The example of this
task is shown in Figure 3.

participants. The crossword clue-answer pairs in this study
were from the same database as in Mueller and Thanasuan
(2013) and Thanasuan and Mueller (2014).

Figure 3: The example of Lexical Association Task

Treatment Tasks
Participants were asked to perform the training tasks twice.
All tasks are described below. We hypothesized that the training intervention would differently assist participants’ memory process on target words.
Word-Stem Completion Task The word-stem completion
task was adapted from Mueller and Thanasuan (2014). In
each trial, participants were given a word-stem with the first
two letters filled and a blank space, such as “ST
”. Their
task was to complete words by typing the remaining letters in
the blank. They needed to generate as many unique words as
they could in 30 seconds. When the time was up, the software
showed some possible answers of the stem for four seconds.
A screen shot from the task is shown in Figure 4.

Free Association Task In this task, participants were given
a target word for each trial as shown in Figure 6. Their goal
was to generate and type words that came to their mind, and
were meaningfully related or strongly associated to the presented word. For example, if the given word was “BOOK”,
they might answer “READ, NOVEL, WRITE”. They had 30
seconds for each trial to give as many answers as possible.
There were a total of 10 problems in this task. After the time
was up, some sample answers taken from the Nelson et al.
(1998) Free Association Norm were shown in the screen for
four seconds.

Crossword Paradigm Task The crossword paradigm task
was originally conducted by Goldblum and Frost (1988), and
was adapted by Mueller and Thanasuan (2013). In this task,
we gave each participant limited time (30 seconds per problem) to solve a series of crossword puzzle problems. Participants were shown a crossword clue and a word-pattern with
two letters filled in as shown in Figure 5. They then entered a
guess answer in the blank spaces. If the answer was incorrect,
the software randomly generated one more letter to provide
additional constraints. A total of 10 problems were given to

Participants first read and signed the consent form. They were
assigned to one of these four groups (A, B, C or D) as are
shown in Table 1. They completed the survey, the reading
span task, the reasoning task, and the lexical association task
as a pre-test. Then, they performed the word-stem task, the
free association task and the crossword paradigm task twice.
Finally, they were asked to retake the lexical association task
as a post-test. The entire experiment approximately took 1.5
hours to complete, but the average time spent for each participant was 56.8 ± 7.5 minutes.

Results
Data from 55 participants were analyzed in this study (15, 14,
12 and 14 in Groups A through D, respectively). The average
scores of the reasoning and reading span tasks were 32.65 ±

the number of recognized letters and the accuracy of sentence
distractions in the reading span task was 0.31 with t(52)=2.34,
p= .02, whereas the correlation between the reading span task
and the reasoning task was 0.24 (t(52)=1.81, p = .08). There
was no significant correlation between the reasoning or reading span task with the other tasks’ performance. Table 2
shows results from the training games. A Microsoft Excel
2013 main dictionary was used as a spell checker for scoring answer words that were generated from the word-stem
completion task and the free association task. We conducted
paired t-tests to compare both iterations of the games. Results showed significant improvements in each game in: the
number of legal answers from the free association task ( p
< .0001) and the word-stem completion task ( p < .0001)
as well as response times, the number of letter cues ( p <
.0001) and cue proportion (computed by the number of letter cues and length in the crossword paradigm task) ( p <
.0001). Moreover, the average unique words generated per a
target word from the free association task and the word-stem
completion task were 64 ± 9.48 and 66.25 ± 21, respectively.
Accuracy of the pre-post tests of the lexical association
task significantly increased from 37.98 ± 1.64 to 38.45 ±
1.91 (t(54) = -1.95, p = .05), whereas response times of these
tests decreased from 3.56 ± 0.93 seconds to 2.67 ± 0.67 seconds (t(54) = 10.98, p < .0001). Response times of each
game condition are shown in Figure 7. The figure indicates
that all training conditions (including the control condition)
were able to improve participants’ performance. We computed post-pre difference scores on response time (Figure 8)
which shows that most participants improved between tests,
but a greater proportion of participants improved in their response speed for the free association task than for the others.
Moreover, the response time improvement for each participant’s group is shown in Figure 9, which also supports that the
free association task was able to reduce memory time across
the groups.

ence and the game conditions was conducted to compare
which game was the most effective training and it showed
that all games reliably influenced the response time improvement (with R2 = .57, F(4,216) = 74.16 , p < .0001 ), and
participants improved the response times of the words studied in the free association task greater than the words they
had done in the other tasks (see Table 3). The coefficient (β)
represents the intercept of response time difference between
the pre-post tests, which means that the free association task
was able to decrease response times in the post-test approximately a second from the pre-test. There was no evidence
that word-stem completion had any advantage over the control condition as well as the crossword paradigm task. We
also compared the response time improvement of each game
group to the improvement of the control group using pairedsamples t-tests, and the results indicated that the time difference between the free association group and control groups
was significant (t(54) = -2.07, p = .02). However, there was
no significant difference between the control group and the

Discussion
This experiment was proposed to study the short-term learning effects of the word training games, including word-stem
completion, free association and crossword paradigm on lexical memory access. The results showed reliable progress
from the pre-test to the post-test for all word games, and with
lexical access, the most improved performance in comparison to the control group occurred with the free association
task. We hypothesize that this advantage occurred because
the testing method involves accessing exactly the same types
of associations to the target word that participants generated
during training. Moreover, they spent more time performing
this task than the crossword paradigm task—less than three
seconds on average for solving each problem in the crossword paradigm task for one answer, versus 30 seconds with
multiple generated words for the free association task. Thus,
this training was more efficient than the others.
One of our hypotheses was not supported by this study—
that training in the crossword paradigm, which strengthens
both orthographic and semantic routes, would provide additional benefit. Instead, our results essentially showed that semantic association training (from the free association task)
is effective, but orthographic training (through crossword or
word-stem) is not. However, orthographic-level training may
show benefits for fluent retrieval tasks that are more focused
on the surface features, and these may be especially help-

Figure 9: Lexical Association Task: Response time difference
between the pre-post tests for each participant’s group

ful for non-native English learners, whose orthographic and
phonological associations to words are weaker.
Another critical issue is that the repetition effects of the
lexical association task were shown clearly in the control condition. Although in this task, the cues besides the answers
were randomly selected, the answers corresponding to the
given words were the same for both pre-post tests. We think
that this may cause the effects in all game conditions, still the
free association effect was greater than the others. To solve
this problem, we may give two different answers for the prepost tests of the same target words.
Consequently, this research provides a basis for understanding the use of word games to promote second language
(L2) learning. According to Revised Hierarchical Model
(Kroll & Stewart, 1994), L2 word learning in early stage is
heavily relied on connections between learner’s first language
words and L2 words. After that, he may be able to learn new
words via a concept mediation. Implicit word learning such
as the games in this study may be another approach to establish or strengthen associations among new L2 words. Additionally, if learner plays the games iteratively, it may help to
improve his long-term lexical memory.
There are many studies supporting that word games similar to the crossword word paradigm task were able to assist second language learners to boost their vocabulary skills
(Anugerah & Silitonga, 2013; Keshta & Al-Faleet, 2013;
Njoroge, Ndungu, & Gathigia, 2013; Ropal & Abu, 2014)
such as spelling and semantic associations. The studies also
showed that the word games were able to increase enjoyment and motivate L2 learners in the classroom (Njoroge et
al., 2013). Moreover, another potential implication of the
research is to help persons with reading disorders to develop

2360

their literacy skills.
