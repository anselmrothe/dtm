Abstract
The process of formation by an artist of an art concept for the
production of a new series of artwork has not yet been
empirically elucidated. The goal of this study is to describe
the process of art concept formation by a contemporary artist
through quantitative analyses of a text corpus based on
interviews with the artist. From an analysis of the frequency
of occurrence of items of vocabulary in the interview data and
the TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency),
we find that the second of three phases in the artist's creative
process was the most critical for the formation of the art
concept, as also shown in our previous qualitative study.
Further, based on an analysis of co-occurrence frequencies of
words, the structure of the art concept is deduced from the
importance of co-occurring vocabulary. By means of
visualizing the network of co-occurrence analysis, it is
clarified that the feature words "The Large Glass" functioned
in the first phase as the medium for dividing the structure of
the concept into two parts. In the second phase, these two
parts of the structure became integrated into one. In the last
phase, the structure of the concept was elaborated on with the
revived feature words, "White Noise" and "Duchamp".
Keywords: artistic creation, art concept, contemporary artist,

1. Introduction
In the field of contemporary art, the artistic creation process
often results in the formation of a new art concept. Such an
art concept plays an important role in contemporary art (e.g.,
Godfrey, 1998). This study aims to capture the processes of
formation of an art concept quantitatively.
By describing the change in drawings during the creation
of Picasso's Guernica, Weisberg (1986, 2006) claimed that
creative problem-solving in the domain of art progresses
gradually with ordinary thought processes. Through a field
study, Yokochi and Okada (2005) also discovered that the
images of artworks were gradually formed in the creative

process of a Chinese ink painter. By analyzing the changes
in the visual characteristics of artifacts in the creation
process of Cubism by Picasso and Braque, Stokes (2005)
proposed that paired constraints, which preclude successful
responses and promote novel surprising ones, facilitate
artistic creation. Through an interview study, Mace & Ward
(2002) showed there are four stages in the creative activities
of artists, and their processes are completed by moving back
and forth between these stages. From these studies, it is
clear that an artwork is created gradually through activities
that change some of the features of the existing work,
externalize new ideas, or collect information from the
external environment, rather than that a new idea or an
artwork emerges instantly. However, the detailed process of
how expert artists gradually generate a new art concept in a
real art creation setting needs to be studied more thoroughly.
The process of formation of art concepts can be captured by
analyzing interviews in which artists talk about their own
creative processes (e.g., Mace & Ward, 2002; Okada,
Yokochi, Ishibashi & Ueda, 2009). Okada et al. focused on
the long-term span of art making activities, using
retrospective interview data with artists. Though this case
study pointed out the importance of analogical process in
artistic creation, the detailed process of formation of a new
art concept was still not clearly revealed. Takagi, Okada and
Yokochi (2013) interviewed a contemporary artist every
three weeks for about ten months, asking him to describe art
making activities using his idea sketches, and photographs
that he had taken in the preceding three weeks of work.
Takagi et al. used qualitative analyses of a part of the
interview data and uncovered some important aspects such
as constraint modification and the use of analogy in the
generation process of art concepts. However, since the data
that they analyzed covered only a part of the ten-months
process, a study of the whole ten-month process is still
needed to capture the entire process of concept formation.

2.2 Outline of generating an art concept

Quantitative analyses such as text mining of massive
language data acquired from interviews can shed new light
on the concept formation process. Some studies have used
quantitative analyses of language data, such as biographies
of creators, including Picasso, to uncover various factors
involved in creators’ success (e.g., Simonton, 2010). Basov
& Nenko (2013) also presented a case study using semantic
network analysis to focus on the knowledge structures
underlying the creative practices of artistic communities in
Spain. However, the former used rather coarse biography
data and the latter was based on short-term interviews with
multiple artists. In order to fully capture the concept
formation process of individual artists in real art creation,
we need further study focusing on a finer grain size of
process data. The methods and purpose of quantitative
analysis are diverse (Hearst, 1999; Feldman & Sanger,
2007). By using the quantitative analyses of a corpus of the
text data acquired from interviews with an artist (Takagi et
al., 2013), our study aims to reveal the change in concept
through the entire process of artistic concept formation.

Shinohara generated an art concept, White Noise (detailed in
Takagi et al., 2013), which served as the core concept of his
new series of artworks, and on which he based numerous
artworks. During the period of this research, in order to
develop his art concept, he first drew his ideas on paper
(Drawing phase) and then took photographs to collect visual
information (Photography phase). After these two phases, he
began the hands-on creation of the artworks (Hands-on
phase). By including the Photography phase, he discovered
the core part of his new art concept.

2.3 Procedure of quantitative analysis
Shinohara’s utterances in all 13 interviews were divided into
text units that were separated by the turn-taking of the
speakers. Table 1 shows the number of text units in each
phase. This study includes a co-occurrence analysis and
discussion of vocabulary frequency as a quantitative
analysis. More specifically, the study was conducted
through a morphological analysis of the scripted protocol
data. This was then followed by a word frequency analysis,
co-occurrence analysis, and network centrality analysis of
the extracted lexical terms. In the morphological analysis,
the MeCab version 0.993 (Kudo, 2012) was adopted, and
the analysis dictionary employed was the modern language
version UniDic2.0.1
(Den, Ogiso, Ogura, Yamada,
Minematsu, Uchimoto, Koiso, 2007). In addition, before the
analysis, words related to the art concept White Noise
("White Noise", "Duchamp", "The Large Glass") and its
subordinate concept ("word balloon") were registered
manually for the analysis dictionary.

2. Method
2.1 Outline of the case study
The participant in this study is a male contemporary artist,
Takeshi Shinohara, who studied art in Japan and in the USA
and has been actively producing highly reputed artworks.
He was in his late 50s at the time of the data collection.
Interviews were conducted 13 times from December 2007 to
September 2008 at a frequency of approximately once per
three weeks (see Table 1).
The following cooperation was requested at the initial
interview: (1) to create new artworks, using ideas inspired
by the replica of Marcel Duchamp’s The Large Glass (The
Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even) (1923), in
Komaba Museum at the University of Tokyo, (2) to take as
many notes as possible of the ideas or images during the
creation process, and to take photographs of hints of ideas,
(3) to give regular interviews. In the first interview, he was
asked about his impressions when he saw The Large Glass.
In the second and subsequent interviews, he was asked to
explain the work that had been produced since the previous
interview. The questions related to, e.g.: descriptions of the
contents and intentions of each drawing, sketch, note or
photo; descriptions of work in production; descriptions of
ideas and thoughts about the art project at the time; future
plans (Takagi, et al., 2013).

2.3.1 Word frequency analysis Firstly, in order to
observe the time series variation of the art concept, which
corresponds to artistic creation, we analyzed the feature
words in all the interviews and in the three phases, in
descending order of frequency. These feature words are the
keywords in the art concept formation, namely: (1) "White
Noise", the name of the art concept itself; (2) "The Large
Glass", the requested theme for the new artworks, as
explained in section 2.1; (3) Duchamp, the artist of The
Large Glass. Additionally, we quantitatively analyzed
feature words of subordinate concepts of "White Noise",
shown in Table 2 (Takagi et al., 2013). As an analytical
procedure, we compared the frequencies of word class
occurrences in each interview and phase, focusing on nouns,
the substantives that function as the name of a specific thing,
and then extracted frequently appearing words by

calculating the TF-IDF index within all speech data. TF-IDF,
the product of TF (term frequency) and IDF (inverse
document frequency), is a weighted statistics that is used to
list keywords in information retrieval and corpus analysis.

2.3.2 Network centrality analysis Based on the results
of the co-occurrence analysis, we described a co-occurrence
network of the top 30 terms in each phase, and applied
network analysis techniques in order to numerically grasp
the differences among the networks. More specifically, we
used several networking algorithms based on the concept of
centrality. Centrality refers to indicators that identify the
most important nodes within a network. Here, we calculated
three measures, which have been used in a number of
applications: degree centrality, flow centrality, and
Bonacich’s centrality. Degree centrality is simply the
number of edges of the nodes. Flow centrality measures the
betweenness of the overall network or the broker role of the
structure. Bonacich’s centrality is a calculation based on the
eigenvectors, in which a node’s centrality is weighted by the
centralities of its connections to other nodes (Kawase, Murai
& Tokosumi, 2009).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Word frequency analysis

utterances, representing nouns (including pronouns), verbs,
adjectives, adverbs and auxiliary verbs in Japanese, were
extracted and the frequency of each was counted.
Subsequently, we analyzed the frequency and the ratio of
the feature words in each phase. In the word frequency
analysis for the three feature terms "Duchamp", "The Large
glass", and "White Noise", it appeared that the frequency of
"Duchamp" and "The Large Glass" were higher in the
Drawing phase, and declined in the Photography phase (see
Table 3). "White Noise" did not appear in the Drawing
phase, but it appeared at a rate exceeding the other two
terms early in the Photography phase. In the Hands-on
phase, the frequency of "White Noise" increased further.
“Duchamp” occurred more frequently than “White Noise”.
These results suggest that, firstly, the artist, who had been
inspired by The Large Glass by Duchamp, thought about it
in the Drawing phase. Having formed his new art concept,
White Noise, in the Photography phase, he further proceeded
to elaborate on his new art concept in the Hands-on phase.
Thus, the quantitative analysis shows that the Photography
phase was the most important phase in generating the new
art concept. This finding is consistent with the results in our
previous research (Takagi et al., 2013). An analysis of the
frequencies of the subordinate concepts of "White Noise" in
each phase reveals that the numbers of occurrences of all

elevated in the Photography phase (see Tables 4 and 2, for
specific categories (Takagi et al., 2013)). The increasing
frequency of subordinate categories suggests that the
attributes of visual features that were used in searching for
the art concept in the Drawing phase were continually used
in the Photography phase to form the new art concept,	 
"White Noise", which is a higher order concept in making
the artwork. It is also critical that the subordinate concepts
of "White Noise" had already been generated in the artist's
early process of concept search, before "White Noise" was
discovered.
In order to extract frequent word occurrences, all the
interviews were divided into 30 instances of turn-taking for
each file, which created a total of 108 documents (mean
capacity 178.85 KB, standard deviation 53.6). From these
108 documents, using TF-IDF, we aggregated the top 25
items of vocabulary from each of the documents. The top 30
of these terms are listed in Table 5. Table 5 shows that the
three feature terms, "Duchamp", "White Noise" and "The
Large Glass", ranked 7th, 15th, 22nd respectively. This means
that the artist talked about these terms throughout the entire

creation process.

3.2 Network centrality analysis
In order to explore the transition of the structure of the key
concepts in each phase, we describe a co-occurrence
network (Fig. 1) of the top 30 terms in each phase based on
the results of the co-occurrence analysis. In order to reflect
the influences of the frequent vocabulary network, the
lengths of the edges (links) are drawn in inverse proportion
to the co-occurrence frequency. In the Drawing phase (see
Fig. 1), two morphological structures are depicted, centered
on "image" (ranked 3rd in degree, 8th in flow, 3rd in
Bonacich's centrality) and "Duchamp" (2nd, 14th, 2nd),
respectively. "The Large Glass" (8th, 3rd, 8th) connects the
two structures. In addition, in the Photography phase, the
morphological structure seems to be embedded in one
structure centered on "image" (4th, 3rd, 4th), "relation" (2nd,
4th, 2nd), and "meaning" (3rd, 2nd, 3rd). In the Hands-on phase,
"Duchamp" (11th, 10th, 11th) reappears in a structure
centered on "image" (2nd, 2nd, 2nd), and it is characteristic

that "White Noise" (24th, 24th, 24th) appears co-occurring
with "meaning" (3rd, 3rd, 3rd), "image", and "representation"
(4th, 4th, 4th). In the Drawing phase, the upper level of
vocabulary shows that "consciousness" (1st, 13th, 1st),
"Duchamp", "image", "representation" (4th, 1st, 4th) and "art"
(5th, 2nd, 5th) are central concepts. Similarly, in the
Photography phase, "consciousness" (1st, 1st, 1st), "relation",
"meaning", "image", and "representation" (6th, 6th, 6th)
appear in the upper level. "Consciousness" (1st, 1st, 1st),
"image", "meaning", "representation" (4th, 4th, 4th), and
"self" (7th, 7th, 7th) are the central concepts in the Hands-on
phase. Among these items of vocabulary, "consciousness",
"image", and "representation" are common throughout the
phases in descending order of value of network centrality.
However, with the higher-order terms, different items of
vocabulary are central to the network in each phase. These
are "Duchamp" and "The Large Glass" in the Drawing
phase, "relation", "photograph" (5th, 5th, 5th) and "shadow"
(8th, 8th, 8th) in the Photography phase, and "feeling" (6th, 6th,
6th) and "condition" (8th, 8th, 8th) in the Hands-on phase.
These results show that the artist started to explore his new
art concept from the external objects "Duchamp" and "The
Large Glass", associating these with "art" and "image" in the
Drawing phase. The subsequent Photography phase suggests
that the artist connected "meaning" and "relation" to
"shadow", which is one of the subordinate concepts of
"White Noise", using "photograph". In the Hands-on phase,
the results show that the artist worked on the internal
representation through terms such as "image" and "feeling",
while being objectively aware of his own cognitive state,
taking into account the influence of the environment.
Thus, by means of visualizing the network of cooccurrence analysis, it is clarified that the feature words
"The Large Glass" functioned in the first phase as the
medium for dividing the structure of the concept into two
parts. In the second phase, these two parts of the structure
became integrated into one. In the last phase, the structure
of the concept was elaborated on with the revived feature
words, "White Noise" and "Duchamp".

4. General discussion
In this study, we have applied quantitative analysis to
interview data on the formation of an art concept. The
visualization of our analysis suggests that the process of
formation of the art concept was influenced by feedback
from the externalization of his ideas and by actual making
of his artworks. The network centrality analysis suggests
that the central words of the network changed as the artistic
activity progressed and the relationship between keywords
in the concepts gradually changed. These results suggest
that quantitative analyses are useful methods for
understanding the formation process of art concepts. We
also conducted egocentric network analysis of the art
concept White Noise with each set of interview data,
focusing on the detailed changes of meaning involved in the
art concept. However, this will have to be presented in a

future publication due to the limitations of space in the
current work.
Previous studies of artistic creation have suggested that art
concept formation is influenced by drawing and by using
external information to develop artistic ideas (Mace & Ward,
2002). The major contribution of our study is to
quantitatively demonstrate that such processes are involved
in the formation of an art concept. Because our continuous
ten-months interviews with an artist provide a very rich data
set, quantitative analysis was a useful measure for an
objective and comprehensive understanding of the process
of artistic creation.
The findings of this study have a certain consistency with
the results of the studies in the domain of art, as mentioned
above, and also in the domain of engineering and design.
Examples of this are the analysis of the protocols and
sketches produced by architects focusing on the role of the
externalization of ideas (Suwa & Tversky, 1997), and the
study of the design process on a design course, presenting
the co-evolution of design problems and solutions, and the
use of analogy (Helms & Goel, 2012). To generalize our
findings, further studies of multiple cases and/or different
domains will be needed.
