Abstract

In the process of learning about such numerical relations,
students are typically drilled on arithmetic facts. The term
“fact” is perhaps misleading, as it suggests a list of arbitrary
pieces of information. However, the successful students are
likely to learn that these facts are far from arbitrary. For
example, the standard multiplication table is not just a list of
associated numbers; rather, it is a relational database in
which the position of a number conveys its status as a factor
or product relative to other numbers, and the direction of
mappings between numbers reflects the symmetry of the
multiplication and division operators. Any specific
multiplication fact, such as 2 × 3 = 6, can potentially be
accessed from any of the constituent role bindings (i.e., 2 or
3 as factors, 6 as the product), thereby exhibiting the
property of omnidirectional access characteristic of
relational structures (Halford, Wilson & Philips, 1998;
Halford, Wilson, Andrews, & Phillips, 2014). Thus to truly
learn the multiplication table is to acquire a multiplicative
schema that specifies interrelated factors and products and
also the dependencies between multiplication and division
(see Campbell, 1999; Campbell & Alberts, 2009).
Despite the clear importance of relational understanding
in mathematics, relatively little is known about the extent to
which students acquire a multiplicative schema that can be
flexibly used to solve math problems. Particularly for
problems that go beyond simple whole numbers to include
fractions and decimals, there is evidence of great individual
differences. For example, Siegler and Lortie-Forgues (in
press) found that pre-service teachers and middle-school
students performed at below-chance levels on estimation
problems involving multiplication and division of fractions
smaller than 1 (e.g., is 31/56 × 17/42 > 31/56?), whereas
math and science students from a selective university were
consistently correct on such items. Notably, pre-service
teachers and middle-school students who correctly executed
fraction arithmetic procedures and exhibited accurate
knowledge of fraction magnitudes were still unable to solve
this type of multiplicative estimation problem, suggesting
their difficulty was conceptual in nature.

Previous research on multiplicative reasoning has shown that
for whole numbers, understanding of division is intimately
linked to multiplication, as retrieval of division facts is often
accomplished through reverse multiplication. We recently
extended this research to rational numbers, and found that
inverse multiplication problems can serve as primes for one
another (e.g., a × b/a = a primes b × a/b = b) when the
second multiplier is expressed as a fraction, but not when it is
expressed as a decimal. In the current paper we propose a
process model of how such relational priming takes place, and
report two experiments that test the limits of this priming
effect. The first varies the format of the equations as fractions
or a total division equation, and shows that priming is only
observed using the fraction format; the second varies the
multiplicative complexity of the factors in the equations, and
shows that priming requires a common factor linking the
successive problems.

Relational and Multiplicative Reasoning
To understand mathematics is to grasp a system of formal
relations among numbers and numerical operations. By the
time children finish elementary school, they have been
exposed to numerous fundamental relations involving both
whole numbers and rational numbers (fractions and
decimals). They are taught, for example, that addition and
subtraction are inverse operations, as are multiplication and
division (Nunes & Bryant, 1996; Bisanz & LeFevre, 1990);
and that common factors connect multiplication and
division (e.g., 4 is a common factor of 8 and 12 because 4
divides evenly into each, which in turn implies that 4 can be
multiplied by some whole number to yield either 8 or 12).
When rational numbers are introduced, children also are
taught that fractions—the first type of number they
encounter with a complex internal structure, a/b—are
intimately related to division. For example, the fraction 2/3
stands for the quantity obtained by dividing 2 by 3; and the
fraction 4/6 is equivalent to 2/3 because the numerator and
denominator of the former (4 and 6, respectively) share a
common factor of 2, and hence can be divided to reduce 4/6
to 2/3.

Relational Priming with Fractions
Previous research has tested the extent to which adults have
access to reciprocal relations when performing

560

multiplication with rational numbers. DeWolf and Holyoak
(2014) gave college students at a selective university a
series of multiplication problems that students’ had to
decide were either “true” (correct) or “false” (incorrect).
Half of the students performed the task with problems that
had the format a × b/c = d, and the other half had problems
where the b/c term was expressed as an equivalent decimal.
Importantly, a quarter of the trials were set up such that two
successive problems were inversely related to one another
(the other three quarters of the trials were foil problems
intended to obscure the relationships between successive
problems). For example, the first trial in a pair (the prime)
might be 3 × 8/6 = 4, and the following problem (the target)
might be 4 × 6/8 = 3. Because 3 × 8/6 = 4 is true, and the
two problems are exactly the inverse of one another, the
target problem must also be true. DeWolf and Holyoak
found that participants showed a significant priming effect,
such that the target problem was significantly faster than the
prime problem (with appropriate counterbalancing to
control for basic problem difficulty). However, no such
priming effect was found when the same exact problems
were presented with decimals rather than fractions as the
second multiplier. In addition, performance on all fraction
trials was significantly faster and more accurate than on
trials with decimals. These findings suggest that (1)
multiplicative reasoning with fractions and decimals is
fundamentally different, affording different strategies and
processes even when the quantities are matched in
magnitude, and (2) college students are sensitive to inverse
relations between problems expressed as fractions. We have
developed a process model of multiplicative reasoning with
fractions to account for this priming effect.

relations between the whole number, fraction numerator,
and fraction denominator are activated.
It is important to note that in the fraction problems used
by DeWolf and Holyoak (2014) and in the experiments
reported here, the relevant pairs of prime and target
problems could always be solved by at least one of the
simplification strategies, because common factors linked
either the whole number and denominator, the numerator
and denominator, or both. The false problems (half of the
total set) could not be simplified in such a way (e.g., a false
problem might be 8 × 9/6 = 9 which does not simplify to 9).
We propose that in the process of evaluating the prime
(i.e., the first trial in a successive primed pair), participants
will typically activate the common factor between the whole
number and denominator, or the numerator and
denominator, in order to simplify the problem (see, left
panel). Hence, if the prime were 4 × 6/8 = 3, then the
numbers 4, 6, 8, and 3 would provide the initial sources of
activation. In Figure 1, the arrows connecting numbers
represent the relation “is a factor of”. These arrows are
depicted as unidirectional to reflect the asymmetry of the
relational roles (factor and product), but we assume
activation can spread in both directions (see Campbell,
1999). We assume for simplicity that the two nearest factors
and products of a number are activated (i.e., those numbers
depicted in the example networks). (Additional
factors/products may also be activated, but two are
sufficient for the problems used in our experiments.) In
solving the prime problem by simplification, relevant factor
relations become highlighted, while irrelevant ones are
deactivated. Thus in solving the prime problem (bottom left
in Figure 2), the fact that 3 is a factor of 6, and/or 4 is a
factor of 8, would become highly active. If the target trial in
a successive primed pair (Figure 1, right panel) is the
inverse problem 3 X 8/6 = 4, these same factor relations are
precisely those necessary for simplification. Hence, the
process of activating relevant factor/product relations will
have a “head start” in the target problem, relative to the
prime problem. Accordingly, priming is expected in that the
target problem will be solved more quickly than the prime
(where the order of the prime and target are counterbalanced
to control for other sources of problem difficulty (i.e., a
problem would appear as the prime for one participant but
as the target for another).
This process model suggests that when a participant
evaluates the target problem, two components determine if
priming will be obtained. First, by definition, the connection
between the prime and target trials depends on the inverse
relation between them. However, in order for this relation
to actually facilitate solution of the target trial, there must at
least be some implicit recognition of how the two problems
relate to one another. The fact that no priming is found
when decimals are used in place of fractions (DeWolf &
Holyoak, 2014) suggests that when the structural parallel
between the prime and target is not apparent (e.g., because
the reciprocals are obscured when expressed as decimals),
there will be no facilitation of the target problem.

Model of Activation for Primed Pairs
People may employ various strategies to evaluate the
correctness of a simple multiplication problem. For
problems with fractions, perhaps the most obvious strategy
is to evaluate the problem in a manner similar to a wholenumbers division problem. For example, 3 × 8/6 = 4 could
be evaluated by first multiplying 3 × 8 and then dividing
that product by 6. This strategy will work on any fraction
multiplication problem, even if the equation itself is false.
However, a limitation of this strategy is that multiplying the
whole number and the fraction numerator may lead to a very
large product.
For problems in which common factors are available,
people may instead solve problems using fractions using a
simplification strategy that minimizes the calculations
required. One potential simplification strategy would be to
simplify the fraction 8/6 to 4/3. The simplified equation is
now 3 × 4/3, which reduces to 4. Another possible
simplification strategy would be to reduce the whole
number multiplier and the denominator of the fraction,
(essentially, 3 × 1/6 = 1/2), which would result in 8/2, and
note that 8 divided by 2 is simply 4. One consequence of
such simplification strategies is that common factor

experiments to test these hypotheses. Experiment 1 tested
whether the structural equivalence afforded by the fractions
is a necessary component for priming. Primarily, the
advantage of the fraction is that it highlights the central term
that is being inverted when forming the inverse relation.
Another format, which is equivalent in magnitude but
differs slightly in meaning, is the division format shown in
Figure 2. In the division format, the relevant reciprocal
relation is obscured, making it harder to recognize the
structural similarity across problems. Experiment 1 assessed
whether the division format will yield a priming effect
similar to that found for the fraction format in the study of
DeWolf and Holyoak (2014). Our process model predicts
that the priming effect will be reduced or even eliminated
when problems are presented in a division format because
the division format does not highlight the structural
equivalence between problems.
The sets of stimuli tested by DeWolf and Holyoak (2014)
and Experiment 1 here were not suitable for testing the
“common factor” hypothesis because they all included
common factors. Therefore, Experiment 2 was designed to
test whether common factor relations are indeed necessary
for successful priming, as predicted by our process model.
We created a set of problems for which there was no
perceptual match between the whole numbers and the

Experiment 1 assessed whether the fraction format in
particular affords recognition of the structural equivalence
across inverse problems, or if relational priming can be
achieved with equivalent problems written in a division
format (see Figure 2).

Method
Participants A total of 74 undergraduate students (mean
age = 21.2 ; females = 59) from the University of California,
Los Angeles (UCLA) participated in the study for course
credit.
Design and Materials There were two conditions: fraction
format and division format. The stimuli and materials were
adapted from the “non-matching fractions” condition of
Experiment 2 reported by DeWolf and Holyoak (2014).
Equations were shown either in fraction format or division
format (see Figure 2), but were otherwise identical. Half of
the participants were assigned to the fraction format
condition and half were assigned to the division format
condition.

Figure 2. Examples of fraction and division format used in
Experiment 1.
There were a total of 240 trials, with 60 of the trials
designed to be true (correct) primed pairs, where the prime
had the format exemplified by 3 × 8/6 = 4 and the target was
the inverse equation, exemplified by 4 × 6/8 = 3. The other
180 trials consisted of 60 “false” primed trials and 120 foil
trials. The false primed pairs were similar to the true
primed pairs in that there was a superficial similarity
between successive problems, but the answers for each trials
was “false” instead of “true”. An example of false primed
pairs is 7 × 10/4 = 8 followed by 8 × 4/10 = 7. The
remaining foil trials were not related to each other in any
specific way. These were designed to vary the order of
trials (true/false, false/true, true/true, false/false) and to
obscure the structural similarity between the trials in primed
pairs. DeWolf and Holyoak (2014) found no evidence of
priming for either false primed pairs or foil problems.
Half of the 240 trials were true and half of the trials were
false. Except for the pairing involved in primed trials,
problems were shown in random order for every participant.

Figure 3. Mean response times for the true prime and target
trials by format condition (Experiment 1).
Response Time Across all trials, participants responded
more slowly to fraction-format trials than division-format
trials (3.57 s vs. 2.79 s; t(72) = 3.65, p = .001). Figure 3
shows the average response times for the true prime and
target trials by format condition. 2 (Fraction vs. Division) X
2 (Prime vs. Target) ANOVA revealed a significant
interaction (F(1, 72) = 4.34, p = .04). There was a
significant priming effect for the fraction-format trials (3.92
vs. 3.45, F(1, 72) = 7.82, p = .007), but no significant
priming effect for division-format trials (3.26 vs. 3.28, F(1,
72) = .02, p = .88).
Overall, the results of Experiment 1 indicate that priming
between inverse problems depends on the fraction format,
which highlights the reciprocal relation between the two
inverse problems. When equivalent problems were
presented in division format, no facilitation from prime to
target was obtained for the true prime-target pairs.
An unanticipated finding was the overall advantage for
the division format over the fraction format in response
time. Although the division format does not yield
facilitation that depends on recognizing similarities across
problems, it may facilitate activation of common factors
within each individual problem. Each format may afford a
different order of operations. The division format may
facilitate multiple solution paths (e.g., Landy & Goldstone,
2010), making it easier to simplify either of the numerator
numbers with the denominator.

Procedure The study was administered using Superlab 4.5
(Cedrus Corp., 2004), which was used to collect accuracy
and response time data. Participants were told that they
would see multiplication (or division) problems. They were
told to press the “a” key if the problem was true or the “l”
key if the problem was false. Participants were told that the
answers were shown rounded to the nearest whole number.
As we were particularly interested in potentially subtle
response time differences, participants were instructed to
respond as quickly as possible while maintaining high
accuracy. They were first given four practice trials that used
only whole numbers. After the practice trials, they were
given a chance to ask questions before starting the test trials.

Experiment 2

Results and Discussion

The goal of Experiment 2 was to test the second hypothesis
generated by the process model: that inverse priming
requires activation of common-factor relations across the
prime and target problems.

Accuracy Across all trials (including prime, target and foil
trials), there was no difference in accuracy for the fraction
condition and the division condition (90% vs. 90%; t(72) =
.007; p = .994). There was also no evidence of priming for
true prime-target pairs based on the accuracy measure,
either for the fraction condition (prime: 88% target: 89%;
t(36) =1.74, p = .09) or the division condition (prime: 86%
target: 87%; t(36) = 1.85, p = .07).

Method
Participants Participants were 37 UCLA undergraduates
(mean age = 20; 24 females) who received course credit for
participating.

Accuracy Average accuracy across participants on all trials
(including true prime, target and foils) was 87%. There
was no difference in accuracy across all trials on the
Double-Mismatch and Double-Mismatch, no CF trials (79%
vs. 80%, t(36) = .68, p = .50). Among the true primed trials,
there was also no evidence of priming based on accuracy
measure for either the Double-Mismatch pairs (79% vs.
78%, t(36) = 1.12, p = .27) or the Double-Mismatch, no CF
pairs (80% vs. 80%, t(36) = .41, p = .68).

Figure 4: Examples of primed pairs used in Experiment 2.
Double-Mismatch pairs share common-factor relations,
whereas Double-Mismatch, No CF pairs do not.
Design, Materials, and Procedure A single within-subjects
variable was tested, using problems presented with the
fraction format. The set of stimuli was identical to the
fraction condition of Experiment 1 except that the 60
primed trials comprised two subsets of prime pairs:
“Double-Mismatch” trials and “Double-Mismatch, no CF
(common factor)” trials. In all Double-Mismatch problems,
the whole numbers within a single problem do not match the
fraction components, and the fraction components between
the two problems do not match. This type of problem
enables tight control of perceptual similarities between the
prime and target problems. The top panel of Figure 4 shows
an example of a Double-Mismatch primed pair. The two
problems are related in that 6/4 is a reciprocal of 2/3. They
also share common factor relationships because 3 is a factor
of 6 and 2 is a factor of 4. By contrast, the bottom panel of
Figure 4 shows an example of a Double-Mismatch, no CF
primed pair. The two problems are related by a reciprocal,
but not by common factors. In Figure 4, 21/6 and 4/14 are
reciprocals (21/6 = 7/2, 4/14 = 2/7). However, in the 2 ×
21/6 = 7 equation, the “is a factor” relations that are
activated is “7 is a factor of 21” and “2 is a factor of 6”. In
the 7 × 4/14 = 2 equation, the “is a factor” relations that are
activated do not match- instead they are: “2 is a factor of 4”
and “7 is a factor of 14”.

Response Time Mean response time across participants on
all trials was 3.83 s. Response times for the DoubleMismatch true prime-target trials were significantly faster
than for the Double-Mismatch, no CF true prime-target
trials (4.96 s vs. 5.75 s; t(36) = 2.37, p = .02). Figure 5
shows the average response times for prime and target trials
in the Double-Mismatch and Double-Mismatch, no CF
prime conditions. A significant priming effect was obtained
for the Double-Mismatch trials (5.21 s vs. 4.69 s, t(36) =
2.1, p = .04), but not for the Double-Mismatch, no CF trials
(5.56 s vs. 5.94 s, t(36) = .41).
These response time results support the prediction of our
process model, in that a necessary condition for priming is
that common factor relations must link the prime and target
trials. The Double-Mismatch trials yielded clear inverse
priming even though they lack perceptual similarity. In
contrast, the Double-Mismatch, no CF trials, which share a
reciprocal relation but not common factors, did not yield
priming.

Discussion

Acknowledgments

The results of these two experiments support hypotheses
derived from a process model of how activation spreads
among common factors during fraction and whole number
multiplication. The fraction format seems to highlight or
isolate the inverse relationship across related problems,
thereby facilitating performance on the target trial. The
results of Experiment 1 indicate that the fraction format
highlights the relevant inverse relationship, resulting in
priming, whereas an equivalent division format does not.
The results of Experiment 2 reveal that the fraction format
with a shared reciprocal is not sufficient to create the
necessary structural similarity across problems. In addition,
an “is a factor” relation that connects the prime and target
problems must be activated in order for priming to occur.
Hence Double-Mismatch, no CF problems, which share a
reciprocal relation but not a common factor (e.g., the
reciprocals 21/6 and 4/14) do not yield priming.
The process model we propose here has important
implications for how multiplication with fractions is
performed. Previous research has examined multiplicative
reasoning with whole numbers but not with fractions. Our
model demonstrates that fractions can be incorporated into a
multiplicative schema that connects them with whole
numbers. College students seem to prefer to analyze the
component parts of fractions, and their relations to wholenumber components in the problem, rather than considering
the fraction as a single unit.
The process model also explains why the fraction format
affords a flexible set of strategies for solving simple
multiplication and division problems. When solvers have a
deep understanding of how fractions and whole numbers are
embedded within a multiplicative schema, they are able to
flexibly simplify fraction multiplication problems based on
their network of common-factor relations.
The present findings thus add to other evidence of major
differences in the procedural and conceptual knowledge
associated with different types of rational numbers.
Although one might expect that people would solve a
multiplication task with fractions by simply estimating the
magnitude of the fraction and hence the resulting product,
this was not the case in our study. Decimals represent onedimensional magnitudes, whereas fractions represent twodimensional relations; hence adults access magnitudes more
easily for decimals than for equivalent fractions (DeWolf,
Grounds, Bassok & Holyoak, 2014). Accordingly,
multiplication is much more likely to be based on
magnitude estimation for problems involving decimals
rather than fractions. At the same time, the relational
structure of fractions is advantageous for reasoning tasks
that depend on relations between certain quantities, such as
that between the cardinality of a subset and the full set
(DeWolf, Bassok & Holyoak, 2015; Rapp, Bassok, DeWolf
& Holyoak, 2015). In general, the different formats for
rational numbers each provide unique affordances for
performing different mathematical tasks.
