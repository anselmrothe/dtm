Abstract
Developmental transitions, such as the onset of walking, are
associated with changes in a broad range of domains,
including language development and social interactions. This
study used a full-day home observation recording to compare
the language environment of age-matched crawling and
walking infants. Central to the study was exploring how the
language environment related to vocabulary development of
each locomotor group. Adult words, infant vocalizations, and
parent-child conversational turn-taking were positively
associated with infant vocabulary development, but only for
walking infants. These findings provide further evidence for
the integrated nature of infant locomotion, language
development, and the social and linguistic environment.

Introduction
Research by Walle and Campos (2014) uncovered a
previously undocumented finding: infant language
development significantly increases following the
acquisition of walking. This link has been replicated both
cross-sectionally in the United States and crosslinguistically with infants exposed to Mandarin-Chinese in
China (He, Walle, & Campos, in press). While these
findings lend support to a link between walking and
language, further study is required to help explain this
relation. Specifically, it is unlikely that walking per se
results in infants learning more words. Rather, walking
likely impacts other factors associated with language
development, which in turn facilitate infant language
learning. The present study sought to examine one likely
contributor: the infant language environment.
The acquisition of upright locomotion (i.e., walking)
provides a number of distinct advantages to the infant over
crawling in terms of motoric efficiency (Sparrow & IrizarryLopez, 1987), perspective (Clearfield, Osborne, & Mullen,
2008; Franchak, Kretch, Soska, & Adolph, 2011; Frank,
Simmons, Yurovsky, & Pusiol, 2013), and exploration
(Clearfield, 2011). In addition, the onset of infant walking
has profound effects on the infant’s social world.
Observational work indicates that parents direct similar
numbers of vocalizations to walking and crawling infants,
but walking infants engage in more frequent prohibitive
activities (Green, Gustafson, & West, 1980) and display
greater “testing of wills” in social interactions (Biringen,
Emde, Campos, & Appelbaum, 1995). Walking infants have

also been found to exhibit more vocalizations, gestures, and
interactions with objects than crawling infants (Clearfield,
2011; Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda, & Zuckerman,
2011), as well as to engage with distal objects and bid for
adult attention, particularly while moving, more frequently
and in different manners (Karasik, Tamis-LeMonda, &
Adolph, 2011, 2014).
Although the above studies did not explore how such
changes in the infant’s social environment were associated
with infant language development, the relation of adultinfant social interaction and language learning has been
widely studied (e.g., Goldfield, 1987; Hart & Risley, 1995;
Jaffe, Beebe, Feldstein, Crown, & Jasnow, 2001; TamisLeMonda, Bornstein, & Baumwell, 2001; Zimmerman et
al., 2009; Greenwood, Thiemann-Bourque, Walker,
Buzhardt, & Gilkerson, 2010; Weisleder & Fernald, 2013).
Quantities of adult-child turn-taking, child-directed speech,
and child vocalizations are all positively correlated with
more advanced child language skills.
Walle and Campos (2014) used naturalistic observations
in a laboratory setting to examine the relation of crawling
and walking infants’ social environments and language
development. They found that language input, parent and
infant movement, and infant location differentially predicted
language development for each group. Specifically, the
variables were significantly related to walking, but not
crawling,
infants’
language
development.
While
informative, this study was limited in key ways. First, the
observation was only 10-minutes in duration, making it
unclear whether the data collected is representative of
infants’ real-world environments. Second, the observation
took place in a laboratory setting and parents were
purposefully distracted with a questionnaire. These
constraints may have affected both infant and parent social
behaviors. Observational data in the infants’ natural
environment and over a more extended period of time is
required to lend validity to these previous findings.
Information about the role of infant vocal behavior and
infant-adult turn-taking in relation to locomotor
development and language acquisition is also needed.
The present investigation used day-long home audio
recordings to explore how same-aged crawling and walking
infants’ language input, vocal productions, and turn-taking
were related to their receptive and expressive vocabulary
development. We hypothesized that walking and crawling
infants would hear similar amounts of adult speech, but

2577

walking infants would produce more vocalizations and
engage in more turn-taking bouts than crawling infants.
Additionally, we predicted that these differences would be
associated with differences in vocabulary size.

Methods
Participants
Thirteen 12- to 13.5-month-old infants were included in the
study. Crawling infants (n = 6; Mage = 12.68, SD = 0.45) had
an average of 4.90 months of crawling experience. Walking
infants (n = 7; Mage = 12.89, SD = 0.40) had an average of
2.78 months (SD = 1.67) of walking experience. Walking
infants all had at least 2 weeks of walking experience to (1)
ensure proficiency of walking, and (2) because longitudinal
findings from Walle and Campos (2014) indicate language
gains following 2 weeks of walking experience. Average
family income was approximately $50,000. Most caregivers
had a high school diploma or college degree. Six additional
infants were excluded for reasons described below.

Measures
Home Language Environment Infant language
environments were audio recorded using the LENATM
system. Small audio recorders were placed in pockets on the
front of specially made vests. Each recorder captured up to
16 hours of audio data. Parents were instructed to turn on
the recorder when the infant awoke in the morning and
leave it on all day. The audio recording was analyzed by the
LENA software, which consists of an automatic speech
recognition algorithm trained on human-transcribed LENA
recordings to apply mutually exclusive sound source labels
to the entire recording (Xu, Yapanel, & Gray, 2009; Xu et
al., 2008). The sound source categories include child
wearing the recording, adult female, adult male, other child,
overlap, electronic sounds (e.g., TV), noise, and silence.
Each sound source except for silence is also labeled as
either being loud and clear or as being soft and muffled;
only the former were used in this study. Within adult
vocalizations, the number of words is estimated. Within
child vocalizations, whether the vocalization contains
speech-related material (e.g. speaking, babbling, singing,
cooing) or only contains non-speech-related material (e.g.
crying, laughing, burping) is also automatically determined.
The software also identifies what it calls conversational
turns, episodes where a child speech-related vocalization
and an adult vocalization are separated by no more than 5s.
In the present study we focused on adult words, child
speech-related vocalizations, and conversational turn counts.
Only infants with at least 10 recorded hours within a
single day were included in the final sample. Two additional
infants were excluded because the recording was less than
10 hours. Adult word, child vocalization, and turn counts
were normalized by dividing by the number of hours of the
recording (Mduration = 15.23 hours, SD = 1.66).

Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary Parents completed
the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development
Inventory: Level 1 (MCDI) (Fenson et al., 1994). The
MCDI contains a 396-item vocabulary checklist. Parents
were instructed to mark words that their infant
“understands” (i.e., receptive vocabulary) or “understands
and says” (i.e. productive vocabulary). Extensive analyses
of the internal validity and test-retest reliability for the
English MCDI are reported by Fenson et al. (1994). Four
additional infants were excluded because their MCDI score
deviated substantially from the norming data provided by
Fenson et al. (1994) (too low, receptive < 30: n = 2; too
high, receptive > 288 or productive > 65: n = 1).
Locomotor Development Infant locomotor development
was assessed using a motor development questionnaire (see
Walle & Campos, 2014). The questionnaire asked if and
when the infant had achieved specific motor transitions.
Parents were instructed to refer to baby books or other
records to assist in recalling the specific dates. Crawling
was operationalized as the child self-locomoting a distance
of at least twice his/her body length. Walking was
operationalized as the child locomoting bipedally without
support for at least 3 steps at a time.

Procedures
Parents were contacted from a database of families in
Merced, CA and the neighboring Central Valley region who
had expressed interest in participating in research. Families
agreeing to take part were mailed a package containing
consent documents, a demographic questionnaire, the MCDI
questionnaire, the motor development questionnaire, the
audio recorder, and two vests. Parents were contacted 4 days
after the package was mailed to ensure receipt of the
package, go over all procedures, and answer questions.
Parents were instructed to complete the recording on a
typical day for the child (e.g., no birthday parties, doctor
appointments). The parent dressed the infant in the provided
LENA-appropriate clothing and turned on the audio
recorder at the start of the day. The infant wore the recorder
throughout the day. Parents were permitted to pause the
recording at any time during the observation, but asked to
keep such pauses as minimal as possible. The parent was
also instructed to complete MCDI and locomotor
questionnaires on the same day as the audio recording. The
parent returned all materials by mail. Participating families
were offered the opportunity to review the recording from
the DLP and erase specific portions that they did not wish to
be included in the study, though no parent elected to do so.

Results
No significant age differences were found between the
locomotor groups, t(13) = 0.88, p = .40. Walking infants had
greater self-produced locomotor experience (M = 6.83
months, SD = .77) than crawling infants (M = 4.90, SD =
1.15), t(13) = 3.61, p = .004. However, total self-locomotor

2578

experience was not related to either receptive (r = .22, p =
.48) or productive (r = .16, p = .59) MCDI score.

Step 2. For Productive vocabulary, Child Vocalizations was
a significant predictor in Step 1. However, in Step 2 this
effect disappeared and a significant Child Vocalizations x
Locomotor Status interaction was present. Visual inspection
of the interaction (Fig. 1C) indicated that vocalizing more
was associated with larger productive vocabularies for
walking but not crawling infants.

Infant Language Environment
Crawling infants heard significantly more adult words (M =
1497.07/hour, SD = 748.80) than did walking infants (M =
711.90, SD = 440.60), t(13) = 2.35, p = .04, d = 1.28. Infant
vocalizations did not significantly differ for crawling (M =
84.83/hour, SD = 33.57) and walking (M = 120.00, SD =
50.69) infants, t(13) = 1.45, p = .18, d = 0.82. Frequency of
parent-infant turn-taking episodes also did not differ
significantly between crawling (M = 27.33/hour, SD =
15.35) and walking (M = 26.36, SD = 19.46) infants, t(13) =
0.10, p = .92, d = 0.06.

Conversational Turns. Conversational Turns was a
significant predictor of Receptive Vocabulary in Step 1, but
was no longer significant in Step 2. Conversational Turns
was a significant predictor of Productive Vocabulary in Step
1. This effect dropped out in Step 2 and a significant effect
of Locomotor Status was present, as well as a significant
Conversational Turns x Locomotor Status interaction.
Viewing the interaction (Fig. 1D) indicated that engaging in
more conversational turn-taking was associated with larger
productive vocabularies for walking but not crawling
infants.

Infant Language Development
Crawling and walking infants’ receptive and productive
scores on the MCDI were compared. Walking infants had
larger receptive vocabularies (M = 124.00, SD = 63.80) than
crawling infants (M = 105.33, SD = 47.16), but this
difference was not statistically significant, t(13) = 0.88, p =
.40, d = 0.33. Similarly, walking infants also had larger
productive vocabularies (M = 17.14, SD = 18.72) than
crawling infants (M =6.33, SD = 6.59), but again this
difference did not reach significance, t(13) = 1.34, p = .21, d
= 0.77.

Table 1: Multiple regressions predicting infant MCDI

Infant Language Environment and Language
Development
Six hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to
examine the relation of each language environment variable
(Adult Words, Child Vocalizations, and Conversational
Turns) to language development (Receptive and Productive
MCDI scores) as a function of Locomotor Status (Table 1).
All predictors were mean centered before being entered. The
language environment variable and Locomotor Status were
entered separately in Step 1; Step 2 included both variables
and the interaction term. Regression equations
demonstrating significant or trending interactions were
graphed to examine the nature of the interaction (Figure 1).
Adult Words. A significant main effect for Adult Words
predicting Receptive Vocabulary was present in Step 1. This
effect dropped out in Step 2, in which Locomotor Status and
Adult Words x Locomotor Status were significant and
trending, respectively (Fig. 1A). For Productive Vocabulary,
neither main effect was significant in Step 1. In Step 2, both
Locomotor Status and Adult Words x Locomotor Status
were significant predictors of infant Productive Vocabulary.
As shown in Fig. 1B, the interaction was such that for
walkers but not crawlers, a high adult word count was
associated with significantly larger infant Productive
Vocabulary.

Discussion
The present study sheds further light on the relation of
infant walking and language development. Surprisingly,
crawling infants were exposed to more adult vocalizations
than were walking infants. This may be in part because
walking infants produced approximately 40% more
vocalizations than did crawling infants (though this
difference was not statistically significant). Also contrary to
our predictions, conversational turn counts were similar
across locomotor groups.
A number of distinct relations were present linking the
language environment with infant language development as
a function of locomotor development. Greater number of
adult words corresponded with increased receptive and
expressive vocabulary size for the walking infants, but not
for the crawling infants. Similarly, frequency of infant
vocalizations and number of infant-adult conversational
turns were related to infant expressive vocabulary size, but
again only for the walking infants.
This study replicates and extends previous research. The
overall pattern of findings is similar to many of results
reported by Walle and Campos (2014). However, the use of
an extensive home observation provides increased
confidence in possible qualitative differences in how the
language environment corresponds with language

development for crawling and walking infants. It also
indicates that a number of different variables related to
infants’ social and language experiences, namely adult word
count, child vocalization count, and quantity of child-adult
vocal turn taking show this pattern of relating to vocabulary
scores for walking infants but not for crawling infants,
suggesting the interaction among many and various
linguistic, social, and motor factors in infant development.

Future Considerations
This data set is plentiful in opportunities for future study.
In-depth analysis of the child-directed adult speech would
help determine if there are qualitative differences in the
language used toward crawling and walking infants that
may account for the differential relations with infant
language development. Analysis of the content of infant
vocalizations could also help to confirm differences in
infant productive language skill, as well as explore possible
differences in phonetic and other features of infant babbling
across this developmental transition. Additionally, the turntaking episodes represent a rich source for examining the
underlying communicative nature of the infant language
environment. Coding of who initiated the vocal interactions
is amenable to automated analysis (Jaffe et al., 2001;
Warlaumont, Richards, Gilkerson, & Oller, 2014) and
would provide more specific information about how
changes in infant-caregiver interaction dynamics may

2580

underlie the observed relationships between locomotor
achievement and language development.
While the data set is high in ecological validity, the
number of infants observed limited our analyses. Many of
the effect sizes were substantial, but not all reached
significance, possibly signaling that the study was
underpowered. For example, although walking infants
vocalized nearly 25% more than did crawling infants, this
finding did not reach significance. A similar explanation
likely accounts for the non-significant differences in infant
receptive and expressive vocabulary scores. Research on
this relation has typically included 20-40 infants per group
to account for the large variability of infant vocabulary
scores (e.g., Walle & Campos, 2014; He et al., in press). A
larger sample would also enable more sophisticated
statistical models to explore how elements of the language
environment may be interrelated with one another in
predicting infant language.
Second, measures of infant language and motor
development relied on parental report. Although the MCDI
is a commonly used measure of infant vocabulary
development, an in-lab assessment of infant receptive and
productive language to corroborate parental report would
strengthen the findings. For the acquisition of walking, we
encouraged parents to refer to a baby book or other records,
as this milestone tends to be well remembered, and also
used a relatively conservative estimate of proficiency (2+
weeks of walking experience) for inclusion in the walking
group. However, confirmatory observational data of infant
motoric development would be preferable.
Third, and more broadly, additional research is needed to
identify mechanisms responsible for the link between infant
walking and language development. The findings suggest
that the language environment plays some role in this
association, but explanations accounting for the differential
impact of the environment on language development remain
to be studied. There are a plethora of psychological
processes that may be affected by the onset of infant
walking which may facilitate language development
independently of, or in concert with, the language
environment. For example, the onset of upright locomotion
provides a clearer perspective and allows for more versatile
interactions with the world (see Frank, et al., 2013; Karasik,
et al., 2011; Kretch, Franchak, & Adolph, 2014). This
perceptual advantage may result in changes in attentional
allocation to and perceptual affordances of objects in the
environment to facilitate word learning (e.g., Yu & Smith,
2012). Onset of upright locomotion has also been shown to
affect the ways in which infants bid to parents with objects,
which in turn affects the types of verbal responses given by
the parents (Karasik et al., 2014). Freeing of the hands may
also correspond with increased use and appreciation of
gestural communication to facilitate word learning (see
Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005; Goldin-Meadow,
Goodrich, Sauer, & Iverson, 2007). Together, changes in
perspective and gestural engagement may aid the
development of joint attention skills critical for word

learning (e.g., Brooks & Meltzoff, 2008). Postural changes
may also affect physiological systems underlying infant
vocalization to affect child speech production (Boliek,
Hixon, Watson, & Morgan, 1996). Finally, it remains
possible that the walkers are overall more developmentally
advanced than the crawlers. Although previous research
using a longitudinal design found an effect of walking
independent of age (Walle & Campos, 2014) and a growing
number of studies demonstrating differences between
crawling and walking infants suggest a more complex
picture, this research does not completely rule out a broad
maturational explanation. Thus, developmental differences
should continue to be addressed in future research. We
predict that no one element of change in the system is
accountable for the increase in language; rather, we think it
likely that the interaction of multiple changing components
in concert facilitates ongoing, dynamic change to the
developmental system (see Thelen, 1995; Thelen & Smith,
1994). Therefore, what is most called for is a longitudinal
investigation incorporating convergent research operations
across a broad range of related, yet distinct, developmental
processes to identify the unique and interactive effects of
potential mechanisms.
In conjunction with previous research, the present study
indicates: (1) a link between infant language development
and the acquisition of walking, (2) infants’ social and
linguistic environment differ as a function of locomotor
quality, and (3) crawling and walking infants’
social/linguistic environments are differentially associated
with their language development. Further research is needed
to more closely examine the relationships identified in the
present investigation, as well as explore mechanisms that
may be related with the acquisition of walking and language
development. Most importantly, such investigations are
likely to prove most fruitful when these processes are
conceptualized and studied in an integrated rather than
isolated fashion.
