Abstract
Perseverance, above and beyond IQ, predicts academic
outcomes in school age children. Yet, little is known about
how very young children learn the contexts in which
persistence is valuable (or not). Here, we explore how young
children and infants learn about the rational deployment of
effort through observing adults’ persistent behavior. Results
from Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that preschoolers persist
more after watching an adult persist, but only if the adult is
successful at reaching their goal. Experiment 3 extends these
findings, showing that even infants use adult models to
modulate their persistence, and can generalize this inference
to novel situations. Thus, both preschoolers and infants are
sensitive to adult persistence and use it to calibrate their own
tenacity.

Introduction
American culture values effort and perseverance. This
emphasis is substantiated by scientific research: grit and
self-control predict high school grades and on-time
graduation better than IQ (Duckworth & Seligman, 2005;
Eskreis-Winkler, Shulman, Beale, & Duckworth, 2014).
Even the way that children think about the relationship
between hard work and achievement predicts school
outcomes. For example, children who believe effort
determines achievement out-perform those who believe
ability is a fixed trait, even when controlling for ability
(Blackwell, Trzesneiwki, & Dweck, 2007). Although
considerable work has looked at achievement motivation
and judgments of self-efficacy in school-age children
(Bandura, 1977; Zimmerman & Blotner, 1979; Zimmerman
& Ringle, 1981), relatively little is known about the
development of children’s tendency to persist in the face of
frustration before they enter school. Here we consider the
question of how very young children learn both the value of
persistence, and the contexts in which persistence is (and is
not) valuable.
In their own behavior, preschoolers are sensitive to
contexts in which effort might pay off: children explore
more, and more strategically, when the probability of
information gain is high than when it is low (Bonawitz, et
al., 2011; Cook, Goodman, & Schulz, 2011; Gweon, Pelton,
Konopka & Schulz, 2014; Legare, 2012; Schulz &
Bonawitz, 2007). However, relatively little is known about
what evidence young children might use in deciding how
long to persist in trying to achieve a goal.
One plausible source of evidence is children’s own past
experience of success and failure. Children are much more

likely to indicate that they are “bad at solving puzzles” after
experiencing failure than at baseline (Smiley & Dweck,
1994). Preschoolers are also more likely to imitate an
adult’s goal-directed actions if they have previously had
difficulty achieving the outcome themselves (Williamson,
Meltzoff, & Markman, 2008).
In novel contexts however, the best source of information
for children about the value of persistence may be what
adults say and do. For example, whether parents praise their
toddlers for effort or for ability affects whether children
believe intelligence is malleable or fixed many years later
(Gunderson, Gripshover, Romero, Dweck, & Levine, 2013).
Such patterns of approval (or disapproval) convey general
information about the value of effort; however, adults can
also convey specific messages about how long a child
should persist on any given task. Children use adult models
to learn both information that is causally relevant to their
goals (Bekkering, Wohlschlager, & Gattis, 2000; Gergely,
Bekkering, & Kiraly, 2002; Schulz, Hoopell, & Jenkins,
2008; Meltzoff, 1995) and behaviors that, although causally
unnecessary, may be plausibly relevant to norms,
conventions or broader social practices (Harris, 2012;
Kenward, Karlsson, & Persson, 2011; Lyons, Young, &
Keil, 2007; McGuigan, Whiten, Flynn, & Horner, 2007).
This suggests that adults’ tendency to persist or quit in the
face of frustration might affect the probability that their
children do the same, on specific tasks and more broadly.
However, children could learn two very different things
from adults’ persistence. They could learn the value of
persistence or they could learn that achieving this goal is
hard, even for adults. Preschoolers understand that adults
are more knowledgeable than they are (e.g., Lutz & Keil,
2002) and sometimes even attribute omniscience to adults
(Wimmer, Hogrefe, & Perner, 1988). If a task is difficult
even for a grown-up, children might well conclude that they
should not bother trying. Indeed, previous studies on
achievement motivation have found that school-age
children’s persistence and judgments of self-efficacy are
influenced both by adults’ modeling and adults’ statements
of confidence (Zimmerman & Blotner, 1979; Zimerman &
Ringle, 1981).
However, children under the age of five tend to be
optimistic about their own abilities and typically overestimate how well they will perform, especially at novel
tasks (Schneider, 1998; see also Burhans & Dweck, 1995;
Cimpian, 2010; Smiley & Dweck, 1994). As long as a
behavior is plausibly within the child’s repertoire, children
may well persist despite the adult’s difficulties. Insofar as
children use adult models to determine when persistence
will pay off, children should be especially likely to learn

1290

from adult persistence if the adult is ultimately successful.
By contrast, if an adult struggles and finally has to quit,
children might be best served by learning that in this case,
persistence is futile.
Critically, even if a child believes that persistence will
pay off, she must decide how far to generalize this insight.
If a child watches an adult struggle to open a door and
succeed, the child could conclude that this particular door is
hard to open and she should try hard to open it; or she could
decide to persist given sticky doors in general; or she might
learn that perseverance in the face of frustration is, in
general, a good idea.
Although the most far-reaching effects of adults’ behavior
on children’s persistence must await future work, here we
evaluate the effect of adult persistence on children’s
persistence, both given adult success (Experiment 1), adult
failure (Experiment 2), and in contexts where the adult and
child have similar goals (Experiment 1 & 2) and in contexts
where their goals differ (Experiment 3). Additionally,
because most research on children’s beliefs about
persistence has focused on school-age children (see Yeager
& Dweck, 2013) and little is known about its trajectory
earlier in development, we begin our investigation with
preschoolers (Experiment 1 & 2). We then see if the adult
models affect children’s persistence even in infancy
(Experiment 3).

Experiment 1
Methods
Participants and Materials Fifty-nine 4-5 year-old
children were recruited for the study, but only fifty-two
were included in the data analysis (mean: 57.56 months;
range: 48 - 71 months) due to parental interference (n = 1),
no video recording (n = 2), not reaching criteria with the ‘all
done playing’ bell (n = 1), not touching the toy box before
ringing the bell (n=2), or successfully opening the toy box
(which was supposed to be impossible; n = 1). Children
were randomly assigned to one of two conditions:
Immediate Success or Effortful Success (n = 26/condition;
ages were matched across conditions. Confidence intervals
reported from bootstrap on mean with 10,000 samples. β =
1.5, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.08]).
Two 18.49 x 8.51 x 8.51 cm wooden boxes were used.
The boxes looked like they could open in a few different
ways, but they actually opened through a secret sliding
notch. A marble was hidden in the experimenter’s box and a
rubber frog was hidden in the child’s box. These toys
produced different sounds when the box was shaken and
were used to indicate that the boxes were different. A bell
was used for the child to indicate that she was ‘all done
playing’ and a toy bear was used to demonstrate the use of
the bell.
Procedure Children were tested individually in a quiet
room off an urban children’s museum floor. In both
conditions, the experimenter first introduced the child to the

‘all done playing’ bell. The experimenter pretended to play
with the stuffed bear, and then said, “I’m all done playing”
and rang the bell. The child was then asked to play with the
bear and indicate when she was all done playing by ringing
the bell. The procedure was repeated if the child didn’t use
the bell to indicate when she was done playing. If the child
failed to ring the bell after three repetitions, they were
excluded from the study.
In both conditions, the experimenter then brought out
their wooden box and shook it, saying, “I think there’s
something inside of there!” In the Immediate Success
condition, the experimenter took approximately 5 seconds to
identify the sliding notch and opened the box. In the
Effortful Success condition, the experimenter made repeated
attempts to open the box for 30 seconds before locating the
sliding notch and opening it.
Next, the experimenter told the child that she needed to
go review some paperwork with their parents and that the
child would get to play with a toy by herself. The child was
also told that, because the experimenter would be on the
other side of the room talking with her parents, they should
ring the bell to indicate when they were done playing. The
child was then given a box to play with. The box looked
identical to the experimenter’s box but had a different toy
inside and was impossible to open. The experimenter then
moved out of the child’s line of sight to talk to their parents.
If the child asked a question during the free play period the
experimenter always responded by saying “I’m talking with
your mom/dad right now. Just ring the bell when you’re all
done playing.” The experiment was terminated when the
child rang the bell or after four minutes, whichever came
first. The experimenter always ended by saying, “Oops, I
gave you the wrong box to open!” Children were given a
different box, and working with the experimenter, always
opened the box in the end.

Results
All results were coded from videotape by two coders
blind to condition (inter-rater reliability r=.99, p<.001).
Because children spent almost all of the time manipulating
the box before ringing the bell, we used latency to ring the
bell as the dependent measure indexing children’s
persistence in all conditions (using an average score from
both coders). To avoid the problems associated with null
hypothesis significance tests, we used a bootstrap method
with 10,000 samples to estimate 95% confidence intervals
throughout. (See Cummings, 2008). Children in the Effort
Success condition persisted significantly longer than
children in the immediate success condition1 (Mean
Effortful Success: 107.23 s, 95% CI [75.8, 136.5]; Mean
Immediate Success: 56.92 s, 95% CI [36.34, 73.0]; β = 0.58
log seconds, t(50)= 2.87, p <.01, 95% CI [0.19, 1.00]; See
Figure 1).

95% CI [-0.44, 0.42]; See Figure 1).
To simultaneously explore how effort and outcome
affected children’s performance, we performed a multiple
regression where seconds playing with the toy were input as
the dependent variable and effort, outcome, and their
interaction as the independent variables. The regression
revealed a positive effect of experimenter success, with
children playing with the toy for a longer amount of time in
the success conditions vs. the quitting conditions (β = 0.66
log seconds, t(100)= 3.10, p <.01, 95% CI [0.25, 1.07]).
When the experimenter didn’t try, children also tried longer,
but the 95% confidence interval crosses over zero,
suggesting this is not true (β = 0.01 log seconds, t(100)=
0.01, p =.97, 95% CI [-0.41, 0.45]). Finally, we found that
when the experimenter put in effort and succeeded, there
was a trend for children to play with the toy for longer than
in any other condition (β = 0.58 log seconds, t(100)= 1.90, p
=.06, 95% CI [-0.01, 1.20]).

The results from Experiment 1 show that children’s
persistence is affected by adult’s persistence at a similar
task. Thus, children seem to be making the inference that if
achieving a goal is difficult for an adult, it will also be hard
for them and therefore they must put in more effort to
achieve that goal.
Experiment 1 raises the question, are children just
imitating the adult’s actions? If so, they are surely not doing
so in a pure imitative fashion since children in both
conditions persist on average more than the 5 or 30 seconds
of persistence that the adult models. If children are not
merely imitating, but instead are trying to figure out how
much effort they should put into achieving a goal, then it
should matter whether the adult model succeeds or fails. If
the adult fails, whether immediately or after considerable
effort, then children should not merely do what the adult
does, but be less likely to persist across the board. In
Experiment 2 we addressed this question by asking whether
adult persistence modulates children’s persistence when the
adult fails to reach their action, both immediately and after
effort.

Experiment 2
Methods
Participants and Materials Fifty-six 4-5 year-old children
were recruited for the study, but only fifty-two were
included in the data analysis (mean: 57.00 months; range:
48 - 71 months) due to not touching the toy box before
ringing the bell (n=3), or experimental error (n = 1).
Children were randomly assigned to one of two conditions:
Immediate Quitting, and Quitting after Effort (n =
26/condition; ages were matched across conditions.
Confidence intervals reported from bootstrap on mean with
10,000 samples. β = 2.0, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.09]). The
materials were the same as in Experiment 1.
Procedure The procedure was identical to that in
Experiment 1, except for that instead of succeeding at
opening the box, the experimenter now failed. In the
Immediate Quitting condition, the experimenter manipulated
the box for 5 seconds and then said, “I can’t do it. Okay,
I’m done.” In the Quitting after Effort condition, the
experimenter performed the same actions as in the Effortful
Success condition except that at the end, instead of
identifying the sliding notch and opening the box, she said,
“I can’t do it. Okay, I’m done”.

Results
As in Experiment 1, all results were coded from videotape
by two coders blind to condition (inter-rater reliability
r=.99, p<.001). As predicted, children’s persistence did not
differ by condition when the experimenter failed to reach
their goal2 (Mean Immediate Quitting: 34.94 sec, 95% CI

The results of Experiment 1 and 2 show that children’s
persistence is affected jointly by the adult’s persistence at a
goal and whether the adult ultimately succeeds at her goal or
not. Children are most persistent when they see an adult
work at a goal and succeed. They also persist (although to a
lesser degree) if the goal is demonstrably achievable, even if
it comes easily to the adult. However, if children have no
evidence that the goal is achievable, adult persistence has no
effect on children’s persistence.
Note however, that in Experiment 1 and 2, the child and
the experimenter played with boxes that looked identical
and differed only in their contents. Thus the child and the
experimenter had essentially the same task and same goal:
open the box to figure out what was inside. Additionally,
the child saw the experimenter persist at only a single task.
In Experiment 3, we extend this investigation in two ways.
First, we show children an adult modeling persistence (or
succeeding readily) across two different tasks with two
different goals. We then give children a third task, with yet
a different goal. If adult persistence merely gives children
information that “this particular task is difficult and requires
persistence” then we might expect no effect of adult
persistence on child persistence when the two are working
on different tasks and trying to achieve different goals.

1292

However, if children draw the more general inference that
persistence is valuable (at least in this context), then they
may be more likely to persist even when the adult model has
provided no information about the difficulty of the task they
themselves are trying to achieve.
In Experiment 3, we also extend this investigation by
asking if the effect of adult persistence on children’s
behavior extends into infancy. In designing the paradigm
for infants, we contrasted two conditions: a success after
Effort condition and a success after No Effort condition.
We eliminated the Quitting conditions because pilot work
suggested that when the experimenter persistently struggled
in vain, infants became too fussy and inattentive to explore
themselves. To ensure that the infants were equally
attentive to both conditions, the experimenter manipulated
the toys for the same amount of time in each condition.

Experiment 3
Methods
Participants and Materials Infants were recruited at an
urban children’s museum and tested individually in a quiet
testing room off the museum floor. Eighty infants were
recruited for the study, but only forty-four were included in
the data analysis (mean: 15.43 months; range: 13-18
months) due to fussing out (n = 3), parental interference (n =
20), successfully activating the test toy (which was
supposed to be impossible for the infants; n = 7), never
pressing the button on the toy (n=5) or experimental error
(n=1). Infants were randomly assigned to the Effort and No
Effort conditions (n = 22/condition; ages were matched
between conditions. Confidence intervals reported from
bootstrap on mean with 10,000 samples. β = .27, 95% CI
[-0.08, 0.04]).
Two toys were used by the adult model. One toy was a
tomato container with a rubber frog inside. The tomato
container looked as though it could be opened by lifting off
the bottom of the container, but actually opened through a
sticker that peeled off at the top of the container. The other
toy was a carbineer with a cow key chain attached. The key
chain lit up and made cow noises when a button was
pressed. An additional toy was used for the infant. The
infant toy was a square box (6.353 cm) covered in felt with a
button with a music symbol on the top. Although this button
looked like it would activate music, a hidden button on the
bottom of the toy actually activated the music. The bottom
of the toy needed to be pressed firmly on a hard surface to
trigger the button. The trigger was intended to be too
difficult for the infants to activate. Additionally two warmup toys (one toy that lights up and vibrates, and another toy
that rattles) were used to familiarize the infant to the high
chair and testing room.
Procedure Infants sat in a high chair or booster seat with a
tray, next to their parent. The experimenter and baby played
with the warm-up toys while the baby got comfortable in

their high chair/ booster seat. First, the experimenter played
with the tomato container for 30 seconds. In both
conditions, the experimenter shook the tomato container
saying, “Look, there’s something inside of there! I want to
get it out!” In the Effort condition, the experimenter
struggled to get the toy out for 30 seconds, saying, “I
wonder how I can get my toy out of here!” and making a
frustrated face. She succeeded at the end. In the No Effort
condition, the experimenter successfully retrieved the toy
within 10 seconds and then repeated getting the toy out
three times, for a total of 30 seconds, saying “Do you want
to see that again?” between each attempt. Next, the
experimenter played with the carabineer and key chain
saying, “Look at this toy. See this!” while activating the
cow keychain sound. “I want to get this off of here!” As
with the tomato container in the Effort condition, the
experimenter struggled to get the key chain off for 30
seconds and in the No Effort condition she took the key
chain off the carabineer three times within 30 seconds.
The experimenter next introduced the infant to her toy
saying, “Now it’s your turn to play with a toy. See this toy!
This toy makes music!” The experimenter showed the infant
her toy and then placed it out of the infant’s view and made
the toy play music. The experimenter then handed the toy to
the infant and left the room. The parent was instructed to
return the toy to the infant if she passed it to them and to
smile and nod but otherwise not interact with the baby. The
experiment was terminated 1) if the infant fussed out 2)
after the baby passed the toy to her parent and/or threw the
toy off the highchair a total of three times or 2) two minutes
went by, whichever came first. At the end of the
experiment, the experimenter made sure the infant was
successful in making the toy play music.

Results
All results were blind coded from videotape. Because
infants did not uniformly attend to the toy until they met the
criteria for ending the experiment, we used a more finegrained measure than time until the experiment was
terminated. In Experiment 3, we coded both how often the
infant pressed the button between the moment they were
handed the toy and the moment the experiment was ended
and how often infants pressed the button between the
moment they were handed the toy and the first time they
discarded the toy (by passing it to a parent or throwing it off
the highchair). Children in the Effort condition pressed the
button more times in total (Mean Effort: 25.09, 95% CI
[17.28, 32.36], Mean No Effort: 14.72, 95% CI [8.87,
20.18]) and before first handoff (Mean Effort: 18.60, 95%
CI [11.78. 24.59], Mean No Effort: 11.05, 95% CI [6.09,
15.22]; See Figure 2) than children in the No Effort
condition. In a linear regression3, we found a positive effect
of experimenter effort, with children pressing the button
more times in total, and before handoff, in the Effort vs. the

children in the Effort condition try harder to make the toy
work by pressing the button more overall, they also tried
harder to make it work before asking an adult for help or
throwing the toy in frustration.

Discussion

complexity of the task, the perceived competence of the
adult model, the child’s past experience succeeding or
failing at comparable tasks, the child’s motivation to
achieve the outcome, the availability (or unavailability) of
graded evidence suggesting progress towards a goal, and the
child’s temperament. How these factors interact to affect
children’s perseverance remains a rich area for future
research.
Second, we have alluded to the difficulty in establishing
how far children generalize the inference that they should
(or should not) persist at a task. The results of Experiment 3
suggest that children learn something more than merely
“this particular task requires perseverance.” However, to
what degree children learn something about the value of
persistence in the face of frustration across contexts remains
unknown. Indeed, although perseverance is a culturally
valued trait, not every task is worth persisting on. An
optimal learner should be sensitive both to the conditions
under which they should persist and when they should not.
Recent research suggests that even toddlers can assess the
costs and rewards of agent actions (Jara-Ettinger,
Tenenbaum, & Schulz, 2015); this sensitivity to the utility
of actions could also support children’s decisions about how
hard to try.
Finally, as noted, the majority of research on children’s
attitudes towards efforts and its relationship with
achievement has been conducted in school-age children (see
Yeager & Dweck, 2013). The findings from the current
study provide initial evidence that as early as infancy,
children calibrate their own effortful behavior based on
adult’s effortful behavior. However, in the current study, we
measured only children’s persistence on a task; in future
work it would be interesting to know how adult models
affect children’s more explicit theories of their own abilities
(e.g., judgments of self-efficacy; Zimmerman & Ringle,
1981). Considering that perseverance, and beliefs about the
value of perseverance, have a very real-world impact on
school achievement (Duckworth & Seligman, 2005;
Eskreis-Winkler, Shulman, Beale, & Duckworth, 2014),
future research might look at how evidence for the value of
persistence within and across contexts affects children’s
long term theories about themselves and their real world
outcomes.

This study looked at whether preschool age children and
infants learn when to deploy effort by observing adult
behavior. The findings from Experiment 1 and 2 suggest
that adult models convey at least two kinds of information
that affect children’s persistence: whether the goal requires
effort to achieve and whether the goal is achievable.
Preschoolers’ persistence was modulated by both these
factors. Preschoolers persisted most when an adult persisted
successfully, significantly less when an adult succeeded
effortlessly, and less still when the adult failed to achieve
the goal. Indeed, when the adult failed to achieve the goal,
the adult’s persistence (or lack thereof) had no impact on
children’s persistence.
Experiment 3 extended these
findings to suggest that 13- to 18-month-old infants also use
adult models to modulate their persistence, and they do so in
relatively far-reaching ways. Infants were more likely to
persist in their attempts to activate a toy when an adult had
persisted, even though the adult had entirely different goals
