recent neuroimaging study, De Martino et al. (2006) found
increased activation in the amygdala when participants
exhibited framing effects in decisions between gambles and
sure options. They suggested the results support dualprocess theory where there is conflict between deliberative
processes and an intuitive, emotional amygdala-based
system. In general, dual-process theory describes two
fundamentally different systems of thought that are involved
in the processing and integrating of information. The
intuitive system is responsible for fast processes which are
affective, emotional, quick, and automatic, while the
deliberative system is responsible for slower processes that
are more analytical, rational, slow, and calculating in nature
(Chaiken & Trope, 1999; Sloman, 1996; Kahneman &
Frederick, 2002; Mukherjee, 2010). The former system is
also known as System 1, while the latter system is
commonly referred to as System 2 (Stanovich & West,
2000).
This paper aims to further investigate dual-process
explanations of framing effects in risky decision-making
and to test a novel prediction regarding time pressure. If
framing effects are attributed to the intuitive system, then
we expect more pronounced framing effects under time
pressure because this system is characterized as being quick
and automatic. We test this hypothesis in a new experiment
and develop a dynamic dual-process model to account for
our results. Specifically, we formalize the underlying
cognitive processes as a sequential sampling model that
accounts for differences between the deliberative and
intuitive systems by changes in the evidence accumulation
process.

Abstract
This work investigates the intuitive and deliberative cognitive
processes underlying risky decision-making by manipulating
time pressure. A recent fMRI study by De Martino et al.
(2006) found greater activation of the amygdala when
exhibiting framing effects suggesting that they may be driven
by System 1. Because this system is characterized as being
fast, we expect more pronounced framing effects under time
pressure. In our experiment, we manipulated time pressure
and accuracy and use a dynamic dual-process model to
explain our results. The model we develop is a sequential
sampling model in which the drift rates and boundaries vary
in accordance with the thinking modes, frames, and time
pressure.

Introduction
Rational theories of decision-making are centered on
maintaining logical consistency across decisions (von
Neumann, Morgenstern, 1944). However, empirical data has
emerged that challenges the “description-invariant” nature
of decision-making (Kahneman & Tversky, 2000; McNeil et
al., 1982). These empirical demonstrations of descriptioninvariance are termed framing effects (Kahneman &
Tversky, 1979, 1981). For example, imagine you are richer
by $300 and you have a choice between receiving $100 for
sure or playing a gamble with a 50% change to gain $200
and a 50% change to gain nothing. Suppose you prefer the
sure option of receiving $100. Now, consider a slightly
different situation where you are richer by $500 and have a
choice between losing $100 for sure or playing a gamble
with a 50% chance to lose nothing and a 50% chance to lose
$200. In this situation, you find yourself selecting the
gamble. This pattern of choices demonstrates a framing
effect because your preferences between the sure option and
the gamble change depending on the problem description,
even though the expected value of the outcomes is the same.
Researchers have suggested that framing effects are the
result of two different systems of reasoning – one that is fast
and emotional (the intuitive system) and another that is low
and rational (the deliberative system) For example, in a

Experiment
Similar to De Martino et al. (2006), our present study
involved a risky decision-making task. Participants were
given a message indicating an initial amount of money that
they would receive on each trial. They then had to choose
between a sure option and a gamble, with the sure option
presented in either a gain or a loss frame. In both frames, the
gamble was identical (i.e., had the same expected value) and
presented as a pie chart color-coded to represent the

836

probability of winning and losing. Apart from using a
single-colored pie chart to represent the sure option, our
experiment differed from the study by De Martino in two
major respects. First, we introduced an aspect of time
pressure for one of the two blocks as this was deemed to
invoke the intuitive system. Second, we provided feedback
for participants’ choices depending on whether or not they
were currently in a time pressure block. This reinforced the
presence or absence of the time pressure and allowed
participants to track their progress depending on the goals of
each particular block.

did not respond in time and did not earn any money on that
particular trial. If the participant makes a choice within the
allotted time frame, they do not receive any feedback on that
trial.
The other block is an accuracy block (ACC) with no time
pressure. For this block, participants are told that they
should “Maximize their money” and are not penalized for
the amount of time they take to respond. In this block, we
provide feedback after every trial explaining the amount of
money earned on that trial. This reinforces the initial goal of
maximizing their money by emphasizing the money earned
on each trial.

Method
Procedure The two blocks and the 160 trials in each
block were randomized. As shown in Figure 1, each trial
began with the presentation of an initial amount (e.g., “You
are given $64”) and the goal for that block (e.g. “Respond
Quickly”). Participants were instructed that they were not
able to retain the entirety of the initial amount, but would
have to choose between a sure option and a gamble option.
1000 ms after the initial amount was displayed, the screen
automatically progressed to this choice screen. In the gain
frame, the sure option was presented on the left side of the
screen as an amount retained as a 100% green pie chart
(Figure 1A) (e.g., “Keep $36”). In the loss frame, the sure
option was presented on the left side of the screen as an
amount lost in a 100% red pie chart (Figure 1B) (e.g., “Lose
$28”). For both the gain and loss frames, the gamble option
was identically presented on the right side of the screen as a
pie chart representing the probability of keeping the entirety
of the initial amount (in green) or losing the initial amount
(in red).

Participants Forty-nine individuals (40 Female; M=20.65
years) from the University of California, Irvine participated
in the study, receiving course credit for their participation
(regardless of performance). All participants were
undergraduate students and were native English speakers.
Materials Eighty randomly generated amounts between $20
and $90 were used for the initial starting values. Eighty
randomly generated percentages (mean = 0.5, std = 0.2)
were generated to serve as the probabilities of winning and
losing for the gamble. From these values we created the sure
option for each trial to match the expected value of the
gamble, depending on frame. For instance, for an initial
amount of $64 and a winning gamble percentage of 0.56,
the sure option would either be “Keep $36” (gain frame) or
“Lose $28” (loss frame).
Ten percent of the total trials (i.e., 32 trials) were
collected to assess accuracy. These catch trials had nonequivalent “sure” and “gamble” options in which one option
was clearly superior. The experiment was comprised of two
blocks, each block consisting of 160 trials: eighty gain
frames and eighty loss frames, for a grand total of 320 trials.
All choices and response times were recorded, as well as
participants’ age and gender.
Framing Effect We are interested in the framing effect that
occurs with risky decision-making between the sure and
gamble options. For this experiment, a framing effect occurs
for a participant when a) in the gain frame, the decisionmaker chooses the “sure” option; and b) in the loss frame,
the decision-maker chooses the “gamble” option. Thus, we
categorize risk-averse behavior in gains and risk-seeking
behavior in equivalent losses as a framing effect.

of a gain-frame trial in the speed block

Time Pressure The two blocks were differentiated by the
presence or absence of time pressure. One block is a speed
block (SPD) where participants are told that their goal is to
“Respond quickly” and for each trial, are given 1000 ms to
make a choice. Since the task involves earning money, a
latent but unwritten goal of the SPD block is to earn money.
However, to ensure time pressure, the only directions given
to participants in the SPD block were to “Respond
Quickly.” If they fail to make a choice within this amount of
time, they receive a feedback message that states that they

We did not find a significant effect of frame (gain and
loss) with regard to the framing effect. The difference
between the mean proportion of framing effect choices for
the gain frame (0.67) and the loss frame (0.68), (t(49) =
0.31, p = 0.88) agrees with De Martino’s study as well.

* Results remain significant even when accounting for block

We examined the influence of two factors (frame and
block) on the framing effect as shown in Table 1 and Figure
3. The main effect of frame in Table 1 was not significant
(gain-ACC proportion 0.62 vs. loss-ACC proportion 0.65;
gain-SPD proportion 0.71 vs loss-SPD proportion 0.70) but
the main effect of block was significant (gain-ACC 0.62 vs.
gain-SPD 0.71; loss-ACC 0.65 vs. loss-SPD 0.70).

Results
We analyzed the results from all 49 participants. The
average proportion of catch trials answered correctly was
0.884. A scatterplot of the overall proportion of framing
effect choices is shown in Figure 2. We see that there is a
greater proportion of framing effect choices occurring in the
SPD block (red dots; 33 out of 49, 0.67) compared to the
ACC block (blue triangles; 16 out of 49, 0.33). The mean
proportion of framing effect choices in the ACC block was
0.64 and for the SPD block was 0.71 (t(48) = 4.25, p <
0.001). The mean reaction time for the accuracy block was
1366 ms (std=756 ms) while the mean reaction time for the
speed block was 494 ms (std=112 ms).

Discussion
Using a risky decision-making task, the present experiment
investigated how framing and time pressure affect decisionmakers’ choices, with a focus on the framing effect (i.e.,
choosing the sure option for gains and choosing the gamble
for losses). The results showed more participants displaying
a framing effect more frequently in the speed block (with
time pressure) than the accuracy block. This adds to a

838

growing body of literature suggesting that a framing effect
might be driven by the intuitive system.
Our current experiment fixes the location of the sure
option on the left side of the screen, and the gamble option
on the right side of the screen. Future versions of this
experiment might include a randomization of these
locations.

process, evidence accumulates over time until it crosses one
of the two boundaries. The speed with which the evidence
accumulation process approaches one of the boundaries is
the drift rate, with a positive drift rate approaching the
gamble boundary and a negative drift rate approaching the
sure thing boundary. The separation between the two
boundaries determines the amount of evidence that must be
accumulated before a decision is made. We assume that the
difference between the thresholds is smaller for the speed
condition (SPD in Figure 4) and larger for the accuracy
condition (ACC in Figure 4). For sequential sampling
models, previous research has shown that the difference
between speed and accuracy conditions is typically
explained by a change in the boundaries (Ratcliff & Rouder,
1998). At some point 𝑡 > 0, there is a switch from the
intuitive to the deliberative system, after which the evidence
accumulation continues until a boundary is reached.

Modeling
We developed a sequential sampling model that assumes
a separate sampling process for the intuitive and deliberative
systems. Our model is an extension of the multiattribute
attention switching (MAAS) model (Diederich, 1997;
Diederich & Oswald, 2014), which predicts rich patterns of
choice probabilities including preference reversals. In our
extension of the MAAS model, drift rates are defined as
𝑑 = 𝑉𝐺 − 𝑉𝑆

(1)

where 𝑉𝐺 is the subjective value of the gamble and 𝑉𝑆 is the
subjective value of the sure thing as calculated by prospect
theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). For an option 𝑗, the
subjective value is the sum over the weighted
values of each outcome:
𝑉𝑗 = ∑𝑖 𝑤(𝑝𝑖 )𝑣(𝑥𝑖 )

(2)

where 𝑤(𝑝𝑖 ) is the decision weight for outcome 𝑖 with
probability p; and 𝑣(𝑥𝑖 ) is the value function applied to
outcome 𝑖 and amount x. The decision weights are defined
as:
𝑤(𝑝) =

𝑝𝑐
(𝑝𝑐 +(1−𝑝)𝑐 )1/𝑐

Figure 4: Simulation of the loss frame. The trajectories
symbolize the accumulation process for three different loss
trials. In one trial (green) the process reaches the boundary
for choosing gamble under the speed condition before the
switch occurs. In the other trials (red and blue) the process
reaches the boundary for choosing the sure option under the
speed condition after the switch.

where the c parameter represents positive payoffs. Values of
these parameters that are nearer to 1 indicate more linear
perceptions of probability.
The prospect theory value function is defined as:
𝑥 𝛼 𝑖𝑓 𝑥 ≥ 0
𝑣(𝑥) = {
−𝜆|𝑥|𝛽 𝑖𝑓 𝑥 < 0

(4)
We illustrate that our model can capture the main
experimental result of increased framing effects under time
pressure by applying it to one set of choices from the
experiment as shown in Figure 1 and Table 2.

We assume there are two drifts; one associated with the
intuitive system and one associated with the deliberative
system. We use the equations above to calculate the drift
rates for both systems, but allow for different parameter
values (i.e., α, β, λ, and c) for the two systems. Further, we
assume that the intuitive system precedes the deliberative
system so that there is a switch in drift rates during the
course of a trial (i.e., the two systems are acting
sequentially, with the intuitive system acting first). We
assume the intuitive system operates first because it is
characterized as being quick and automatic.
Figure 4 shows three different simulations of a loss-frame
trial: choosing the gamble (upper, positive boundary) or
choosing the sure thing (lower, negative boundary). In this

We set the parameter values for the sample trial above as
shown in Table 3. Parameter values for the intuitive system
were based upon Tversky & Kahneman’s prospect theory
values (1992). These parameter values were used by
Tversky and Kahneman to account for a wide range of
choice behavior including the fourfold pattern of risk
attributes, which includes framing effects similar to the ones
discussed in this paper. Because the deliberative system is
characterized as being rational, we set the parameter values
to 1 so that subjective values were the same as expected
values.

gamble decreases (i.e., the sure option is selected more
often). Also, as the switch time increases (i.e., spending
more time in the intuitive system), the probability of
choosing the gamble decreases. Similarly, Figure 6B shows
the probabilities of choosing the gamble for the loss frame.
Again we see the expected framing effect: as the difference
between bounds decreases, the probability of choosing the
gamble increases for losses. As the switch time increases,
the probability of choosing the gamble increases.

Table 3: Parameter values used for modeling.
Intuitive system
𝛼𝐼 = 0.88
𝛽𝐼 = 0.88
𝜆𝐼 = 2.25
𝑐𝐼 = 0.61

Deliberative system
𝛼𝐷 = 1.00
𝛽𝐷 = 1.00
𝜆𝐷 = 1.00
𝑐𝐷 = 1.00

To incorporate the reference point, denoted by 𝑟, we
assume the subjective value of the gamble is:
𝑉𝐺 = 𝑤(𝑝+ )𝑣(𝑟)

Figure 6A: Heatmap showing the probability of choosing
the gamble for gains, searched over different switch times
and differences between boundaries

where 𝑝+ is the probability of keeping this amount. For
gambles, participants either receive 𝑟 or 0 and 𝑣(0) = 0.
Because the gamble is described the same way in both the
gain and the loss frames (that is, participants see the same
pie chart), we assume that 𝑉𝐺 is the same in both frames.
However, the sure option is described differently in the
two frames. In the gain frame, participants are told they can
keep 𝑠 and in the loss frame, they are told that they will lose
𝑙 = 𝑟 − 𝑠. To capture these differences in framing, we
assume that the subjective value of the sure thing in the gain
frame is:
𝑉𝑆 (𝑠) = 𝑣(𝑠)

(5)

and in the loss frame is:
𝑉𝑆 (𝑟 − 𝑙) = 𝑉𝑆 (𝑟) + 𝑉𝑆 (−𝑙) = 𝑣(𝑟) + 𝑣(−𝑙).

(6)

Note that the decision weights are equal to 1 since there is
no risk or uncertainty involved in the sure option.

Figure 6B: Heatmap showing the probability of choosing
the gamble for losses, searched over different switch times
and differences between boundaries

For the example gamble described in Table 2, we
searched over different switch times (i.e., amount of time
spent in the intuitive system before switching to the
deliberative system) between 3 and 1000 ms and over
different values for the difference between the thresholds
between 2 and 10. Figure 6A shows a heatmap plot of the
probabilities of choosing the gamble for the gain frame. We
see the expected trends that illustrate the framing effect: as
the difference between bounds decrease (i.e., corresponding
to increased time pressure), the probability of choosing the

Discussion
Using a risky decision-making task and the element of
time pressure, the present experiment investigated the
framing effect and its relationship to dual process theory.
The results from our study show that there was a greater
occurrence of the framing effect when decision-makers were

840

put under time pressure. These results add to a growing
body of literature suggesting that framing effects are driven
by the intuitive system.
The present results extend the findings from De Martino
et al. (2006), but using a different presentation of options (a
pie chart for the sure option in addition to the gamble
option), a feedback system, and most importantly an
element of time pressure that allowed for distinguishing
between a fast, emotional response and a deliberative,
calculated response.
Most past dual process models have been verbal models,
which do not provide exact predictions. Our model is one of
the first formalized accounts of dual systems of reasoning.
Further, our model is dynamic, taking into account the
timing of the two systems. In our approach, we use a
sequential sampling model where the intuitive and
deliberative systems are associated with different evidence
accumulation processes. Such a model is able to take into
account the two different cognitive processes of the intuitive
and the deliberative system, as well as incorporate a switch
in the sequential processing of the intuitive to the
deliberative system. Our model explains the framing effects
found in both our studies and previous findings.
In our model, the intuitive and deliberative systems are
distinguished by a change in the evidence accumulation
process, as captured by different drift rates. However, both
systems are assumed to follow the same valuation process as
defined by Prospect Theory. The idea that the two systems
use the same valuation process connects with work by
Glöckner and Betsch (2008) showing that the weighted
additive rule (WADD) of utility theory can account for both
decisions made by automatic processes driven by the
intuitive system and those made by the deliberative system.
Thus, it is not necessary to characterize the two systems as
using separate decision strategies. As shown in the current
paper, differences between intuitive and deliberative
systems can be accounted for by simply allowing for
changes in how evidence is accumulated during the time
course of the decision.
