of student enrollment (National Science Board, 2012) and
corporate market (Adkins, 2008, 2011). Second, surveys of
both faculty and students indicate a belief that cheating is
more prevalent in online exams when students are not
proctored (Kennedy et al., 2000; Watson & Sottile, 2010).
Third, empirical studies have demonstrated that given the
same online learning materials, scores in un-proctored
exams were not only significantly higher than proctored
ones (Prince et al., 2011) but also had significantly lower
degrees of explanatory power to students’ ability (Harmon
& Lambrinos, 2008). Therefore, although online education
provides opportunities to people who traditionally would
not have access to high quality education due to schedule
conflicts or physical constraints, these opportunities may be
undercut if prospective employers do not trust the diplomas
and certificates gained through online courses.
The prevention of academic dishonesty can be addressed
to some extent by altering the assessments. Examples of this
would include using multiple versions of an exam,
randomizing question order, or not using identical exam
questions from previous semesters (Harmon, Lambrinos, &
Buffolino, 2010). However, a need remains to replace the
traditional proctor in the room by another system to ensure
the qualification of the online degrees offered by institutions
(Frank, 2010; Harmon et al., 2010). A survey of techniques
and tools for proctoring remotely administered exams
(Frank, 2010) found that the majority of solutions involve
recording an exam attempt or streaming a live video to a
proctor who will monitor or review the exam sessions from
a remote location. However, a naive approach of reviewing
a set of recordings of individual exams may take
significantly more effort than it would take a single proctor
to monitor students in a traditional classroom setting.
The objective of this paper is to explore significant factors
which may not only improve the effectiveness of remotely
administrated exams but also scale the use of online
proctoring. The primary contribution of this paper is to test

Abstract
In an attempt to assist proctors to prevent test takers from
academic dishonesty in remotely administrated exams, this
study investigated the ability of test takers’ behaviors during
online assessments to predict their cheating decisions.
Specifically, this experimental study focused on the role of
students’ time delay and certainty rating during lab based
online testing sessions. The analysis of hierarchical logistic
regression indicated that not only time delay but also certainty
rating had significantly statistical relation to test takers’
cheating decisions. The importance of the two proposed
factors during online assessments was discussed and the
prospects of the improvements of online proctoring systems
were addressed.

Introduction
Academic institutions are turning to online education in
order to expand their reach and provide education to a
greater volume and more diverse group of students, while at
the same time, using less faculty labor and less physical
infrastructure than traditional face-to-face courses.
However, the distributed nature of online courses presents a
potential risk of increased academic dishonesty, particularly
when students are asked to take exams at remote locations
without a proctor in the room (Harmon & Lambrinos, 2008;
Kennedy, Nowak, Raghuraman, Thomas, & Davis, 2000;
Prince, Fulton, & Garsombke, 2011; Watson & Sottile,
2010). In order to ensure the integrity of student work, in
2008, Congress authorized the Higher Education
Opportunity Act with the provision that it is the requirement
for an institution that offers distance education to verify the
identity of online students (Frank, 2010).
There are at least three important reasons for addressing
issues of academic dishonesty in distance education. The
first is an increasing trend in online education, both in terms

the ability of test taking behavior to predict student cheating
during online exams. Specifically this paper tests the impact
of a student delay time to answer a question and the student
certainty rating for the question.

Response Times in Testing

Literature Review
Previous Research in Academic Dishonesty
Crown and Spiller (1998) reviewed a wide range of
research on collegiate cheating and categorized factors into
two types, individual factors and situational factors.
Individual factors represent the sum total of the life
experiences and circumstances, including personal
attributes, type of education and personality variables.
Situational factors represent the situational pressures which
come to bear on the individual to encourage or discourage
cheating decisions, including honor codes, sanctions, values
counseling, and surveillance (Crown & Spiller, 1998).
Based on the research from Crown and Spiller (1998),
some researchers formulated structural equation models
showing interaction among all possible variables in
individual factors and situational factors (Murdock, Hale, &
Weber, 2001; Sierra & Hyman, 2006; Smith, Davy,
Rosenberg, Haight, & G, 2003). Murdock et al. (2001)
categorized individual factors into six categories including
grade in school and five academic motivations (academic
self-efficacy, personal task goals, personal extrinsic goals,
classroom task goals, and classroom extrinsic goals).
Situational factors were classified into four categories based
on social motivations (participation structure, teacher
commitment/ competence, and level of school teacher
respect and school belonging). The significant factors
included grade in school, academic self-efficacy, extrinsic
goal orientation, participation structure, teacher commitment
and teacher respect. Smith et al. (2003) grouped individual
factors into demographic and attitudinal variables, and
organized situational factors into in-class deterrents. Their
results indicated that the primary influences on future
cheating were in-class deterrents, prior cheating, and the
degree of neutralization. Sierra and Hyman (2006) proposed
a new model of cheating intentions based on individual
factors including cognitive constructs and anticipated
emotion constructs. Although prior research (Murdock et al.,
2001; Smith et al., 2003) indicated significant relationships
between individual factors and situational factors related to
cheating intentions, neither the effect of anticipated positive
emotions (e.g. elation) nor the simultaneous effect of
cognitive factors (e.g., locus of control and personal
expertise) in individual factors was considered. Sierra and
Hyman (2006) conducted an empirical experiment and
revealed that anticipated emotional and personal expertise
have significantly positive effect to drive uncertain choice in
cheating contexts, while internal locus of control has a
significantly negative effect.

One of the factors proposed in this paper is time delay in
online testing, which may indicate suspicious behaviors in
online exams, such as, cheating. The traditional approach to
detecting aberrant behavior is to use person-fit analysis by
which aberrant response patterns that defy some expectation
can be an index to validate the integrity of test scores
(Meijer & Sijtsma, 2001). Although the methods of personfit analysis have been well developed for the last two
decades, the reasons for aberrant response patterns are still
largely unknown. However, cheating is one of the reasons
for aberrant response patterns (Meijer & Sijtsma, 2001;
Petridou & Williams, 2007).
Fortunately, in 2008, Van Der Linden and Guo used
response times (RTs) as an additional source of information
on the test taker’s behavior. They conducted a simulation
study on two cheating behaviors: (1) pre-knowledge of
some of the items; (2) attempts to take tests only for the
purpose of memorizing the items. Under 800 replications of
the pre-knowledge simulation, given one item which a test
taker had pre-knowledge of and answered within 10
seconds, the satisfactory power of detecting the cheated item
was 0.83 with 𝛼 = 0.05 . Under 800 replications of
memorization simulation, given 5 items which a test taker
tried to memorize within a 30 minutes exam, the satisfactory
power of detecting that one, two, three, four and five items
that test taker memorized were 0.26, 0.35, 0.20, 0.10, and
0.04 respectively, with 𝛼 = 0.05.

Impasses in Learning
The other factor we focus on is students’ certainty rating
on the scale from one to five, where one indicates a guess
and five indicates knowledge with high confidence. The
certainty rating as a factor is inspired by the theory of
impasses during learning. Impasses are obstructions
students encounter in academic settings. They occur when a
student gets stuck, detects an error, or does an action
correctly but expresses uncertainty about it (VanLehn, Siler,
Murray, Yamauchi, & Baggett, 2003). A cognitive system is
in disequilibrium when individuals are confronted with
problems or situations that present obstacles to goals,
anomalous events, contradictions, discrepancies, and
obvious gaps in their knowledge (Graesser, Lu, Olde,
Cooper-Pye, & Whitten, 2005). Confusion is exhibited
when students hit an impasse and learning is the key process
to transition a cognitive system from disequilibrium to
equilibrium (Craig, Graesser, Sullins, & Gholson, 2004;
Craig, 2012; D’Mello, Lehman, Pekrun, & Graesser, 2014;
Lehman, D’Mello, & Graesser, 2012; Lehman, D’Mello, &
Strain, 2011).

Current study
Rather than focusing on personal or situational factors,
this paper examined test taking behaviors. Specifically it
investigated if students’ delay time to answer a question and
their certainty rating for the question impacted their decision
to cheat. This study implemented a common metric to

define cheating behaviors used by a majority of proctoring
systems: a misuse of forbidden resources, such as a smart
phones or cheat sheets (Frank, 2010).
Based on Van der Linden and Guo (2008) model that used
response times as a potentially significant factor for
cheating, it is hypothesized that the time a test taker spends
on a single question plays a significant role in predicting
students’ decision to consult a forbidden resource. It is
expected that test takers spend a greater amount of time to
search for the answer than as opposed to answering the
question honestly.
Additionally, the student’s confidence in their ability to
answer the question correctly could impact their cheating
behavior. When a student encounters a question that they
cannot answer or have difficulty answering, their level of
certainty will decrease. This inability to answer the question
is the equivalent to an impasse (VanLehn et al., 2003) in a
learning setting. During testing, there are no learning
opportunities remaining to work pass the impasse. If the
student is sufficiently motivated to provide a correct answer
and resources are readily available with limited monitoring
within the online setting, as uncertainty level increase,
students are more likely to cheat because it is the only way
to resolve the impasse and move forward.
This paper seeks to answer the following two research
questions: (1) Can time delay be an indication reliably
predict cheating decisions during online exams? (2) Can
student’s certainty rating be an indication to reliably predict
cheating decisions during online exams? In order to answer
the two research questions, there are two null hypotheses for
each question:
𝐻10 A test taker’s time delay on each question has no
statistically significant relation to cheating decisions
during online exams.
𝐻20 A test taker’s certainty rating on each question has
no statistically significant relation to cheating
decisions during online exams

Python program was selected as the domain because most
participants would not have been exposed to it before the
study. So, it was less likely they would already know the
answers to the test.
The Python lecture started by the introduction of
Python interpreter, such as entering and leaving Python
interpreter through terminal, different types of variables in
Python, declaration of variables and assigning new values to
the declared variables. After that, the lecture went over
some default operators and functions in Python, for
example, modulo and comparison operators and a length
function. Finally, participants were taught how to declare
and execute their own functions in a Python file.
Testing materials. Two ten-item multiple choice
tests were presented to participants. Both of these tests
covered the material presented on the Python programming
language, but each test had unique questions and covered
different concepts. The first test session was implemented
within a typical online exam setting. The second session
was implemented in a cheating inducing environment in
which participants were encouraged to answer questions by
all means even if cheating. The second session was used to
ensure that some cheating behaviors were observed.
Cheating materials. The notes and documents
provided in the learning phase were returned to participants
as cheating materials. The cheating materials included one
page of self-written notes and two pages of summary of the
video lecture. Participants were allowed to put the cheating
materials at any place they liked.
Interview materials. At the end of each testing
phases, participants were interviewed by the experimenter.
This interview required participants to provide a selfreported certainty rating, prior knowledge, self-reported
cheating, methods for cheating, preparation of cheating, and
demographic survey for each question. In this paper, we
only focused on answering certainty, prior knowledge, and
self-reported cheating. The participant’s certainty rating
consisted of a scale from one to five, where one indicates a
guess and five indicates knowledge with high confidence
Prior knowledge was assessed by self-reports with a scale
from zero to five, while zero indicates no knowledge on
computer programming and five indicates mastering the
topic before the experiment. For the cheating measure, the
experimenter stepped one by one through each assessment
item and asked if the participant cheated. If they cheated
they received a follow up questions of how they cheated on
the question. Finally, participants reported to the experiment
whether they had a thorough plan to cheat or had an
impulsive cheating if they cheated in online exams.

Methods
Participants
Forty-two students (28 male, 14 female) took part in the
study. They were between the ages of 18 and 36 (M = 20.93,
SD = 3.90). Participants were undergraduate students
enrolled in an Introductory Psychology course. They were
offered partial course credit in return for their participation
in the study.

Materials
Learning materials. The learning materials were a
12 minute video covering the basics of the Python computer
programming language. Two pages of printed summary
along with the video lecture were provided to participants
during the learning phase. In addition, one piece of blank
paper was provided to participants. Participants were
allowed to take their own notes either on the two pages of
summary or on the blank page while watching the video.

Procedure
The experiment was a repeated-treatment design. Figure 1
shows a diagram of the overall process that participant’s
undertook. After participants arrived at the lab and
completed the informed consent procedure, they completed
the study which consisted of four phases labeled phase A
through D in Figure 1.

not if they want to cheat in online exams.

Results
A hierarchical logistic regression was conducted using
subjects, previous experience, time delay and certainty
rating as predictor variables to predict student’s cheating
behavior (criterion variable). The initial model had two
predictors, subject and previous experience. This indicated
that these two variables were not significant predictors of
cheating, 𝜒2 (2) = 1.49; 𝑝 > 0.05. The first model had
an 𝑅2 = 0.004 . A second model added time delay as a
predictor. This addition resulted in a significant model,
𝜒2 (1) = 48.91; 𝑝 < 0.001. The delta 𝑅2 between the first
model and the second model are 0.109 and the second
model had an 𝑅2 = 0.113 . Finally, in the third model,
certainty rating is added in addition to the previous predictor
variables resulting in a significant change, 𝜒2 (1) =
7.81; 𝑝 < 0.01. The delta 𝑅2 between the second model
and the third model were 0.016 and the third model had
𝑅2 = 0.129. This indicates that student’s certainty rating is
a significant factor to predict cheating decisions. Time delay
has the strongest predictive power with exp(𝐵) =
1.00; 𝑡(1) = 29.01; 𝑝 < 0.01, which means an increment
of one second will increase about one percent of odds ratio
of cheating. Certainty was also significant predictor with
negative relationship as certainty decreased likelihood of
cheating increased, exp(𝐵) = 0.757; 𝑡(1) = 7.83; 𝑝 <
0.01. The mean and S.D. of time delay and certainty rating
for cheating and non-cheating items is provided in Table 1.

Phase A was a learning session. After the informed
consent process was completed and initial instructions
presented to participants, they started the learning phase of
the study. In this phase, participants were asked to watch a
12 minute video lecture on the subject of programming in
the Python language. One piece of blank paper and two
pages of printed summary were provided to participants as
notes and learning materials. After finishing the video
lecture, the experimenter went through the learning
documents to make sure that participants not only
understood the content in the video lecture, but also were
familiar with the content in the learning documents.
Therefore, participants could find the answers in the
learning materials while using them as cheating materials.
Phase B was a replication of a typical online testing
setting. Participants took a 13 minute online exam in which
forbidden resources such as smart phones and cheat sheets
were not allowed. The computer system was also locked
into the testing program, by which participants could not
leave the exam window until they finished the exam. Only
the experimenter knew the special keystroke combination to
leave the testing program. So, no online resources could be
accessed during the experiments. The time and positions of
mouse clicks, webcam videos, and time on questions were
recorded during this experiment. However, analysis of the
dataset collected in the phase B was beyond the scope of the
current study. The goal of this session was to make
participants familiar with the testing environment.
Phase C was a cheating inducing environment.
Participants again took a 13 minute exam and were asked to
cheat without being caught by an online proctoring system.
The forbidden materials were returned to participants.
Participants had 5 minutes to arrange their cheating
materials before starting the exams. The time and positions
of mouse clicks, webcam videos, and time delay in each
question were recorded by a proctoring system. In this
study, only time delay in the phase C was analyzed.
In phase D, the experiment stepped one by one through
each assessment item and asked participants’ certainty
rating of each question and if they cheated. If they cheated,
they received a follow up questions of how they cheated on
the question. After that, participants were given a
demographic survey, including their major, previous
experiences in computer programming, gender, age and the
year in school. Finally, participants reported to the

Discussion
Both null hypotheses, 𝐻10 and 𝐻20 , were rejected and it
was concluded that not only time delay but also certainty
rating of each question were significant predictors of test
takers’ cheating decisions. Specifically, the probability of
cheating was positively related to time delay but negatively
related with the participant’s certainty rating. The results
also indicated that neither subjects themselves nor their
experiences in the test materials significantly predicted
cheating decisions. The strongly positive relationship
between time delay and academic dishonesty matches the
expectation that given the opportunity to cheat, cheaters
spend more time in consulting forbidden resources than
non-cheaters. The significant relationship between
uncertainty rating and cheating behaviors is also compatible
with impasse theory (VanLehn et al., 2003).
One of the strengths in this study was that the incidents of
cheating were based on retrospective reports provided
directly after testing instead of questionnaire surveys, which

390

were not based on actual behavior, but only responses to
potential situations (Crown & Spiller, 1998; Murdock et al.,
2001; Sierra & Hyman, 2006; Smith et al., 2003). A
challenge to the use of surveys to determine cheating
intentions is a possible self-report bias which may lead to
underreporting (Scheers & Dayton, 1987) or over-reporting
the probability of cheating (Nelson & Schaefer, 1986). It
can be argued that surveys may depend upon students to
admit their guilt which may be to their perceived
disadvantage and cause them under-report dishonest
behaviors. Conversely, it can be argued that subjects
perceive their deviant behaviors which place themselves at
odds with others in the classroom and therefore over-report
cheating (Crown & Spiller, 1998).
The other strength in this study was that the proposed
factors, such as time delay, can be monitored in real time.
The factors explored in the previous research were
personal/situational constructs, which ignore the dynamic
behaviors of test takers during online testing. Moreover,
given the personal/situational factors, it seems unlikely for
schools to run a mass profiling survey. The proposed factor,
time delay, provided an objectively quantitative
measurement which can be easily implemented and coped
with current online proctoring systems.
Since current proctoring system can record test takers
behaviors during online exams, including facial expressions,
it is possible that a test taker’s certainty rating of each
question can be assessed more objectively based on
affective states, for example, confusion (Craig, D’Mello,
Witherspoon, & Graesser, 2008). Craig et al. (2008) found
that the physical exhibition of confusion has a significant
relationship to observable human facial action units (Ekman
& Friesen, 1978), especially for AU 4 and AU 7. The
current findings provide the basis for future work on the
automatic analysis of video data. The analysis of confusion
and delay time through recorded videos also provides an
opportunity for proctoring systems to monitor test takers’
certainty rating in real time.
There are several open questions left in this research. The
first one, classification accuracy, is currently unknown.
Further research is still needed to determine the accuracy for
classification but the significant features found in this paper
are a start toward such as a model of detecting suspicious
behaviors during remote testing. The application of this
research could be significant time reduction in remote
proctoring.
The second open question is the relationship among time
delay, certainty, and cheating. Theoretically, time delay and
certainty are both causes of cheating. However, low
certainty could be a prerequisite for cheating and time delay
could be a consequence of the act of searching for the
answer in the materials.
The third open question is the validity of the research in
the real world. It is possible that the research could not have
the fidelity to transfer from the laboratory setting into a real
world setting. Therefore, replication in the real world setting

would be beneficial for understanding the generalizability of
the finding.
The fourth open question is that there are other potential
factors other than time delay and uncertainty useful for
detecting cheating behaviors during online exams. It is not
recommended that the classification criteria of cheating
behaviors are just based on two proposed factors. Proctors
should combine more evidence, such as checking the
recorded videos and see if test takers actually access
forbidden resources. The propose work only indicated that
time delay and certainty rate are significant factors which
may help proctors to improve the proctoring process in
remotely administrated exams.
Finally, proctoring has been shown to not only deter
cheating in online assessments but also enhance learning
performance in online courses. Wellman (Wellman, 2005)
showed that online-module delivery paired with proctored
quizzes was more effective in promoting learning when
compared to un-proctored quizzes. The proctored group
practiced more frequently than the un-proctored group,
especially students in the bottom half of performers. In
spite of the benefits, it can be impractical to supervise all
quizzes in large online courses. Typically only high-stakes
exams, such as midterms or final exams, are under
surveillance (Luecht, 2006). The standard methods of
proctoring and human surveillance are extremely resource
intensive. This current work provides the first steps toward
potential methods to automatically detect cheating during
online assessments.
