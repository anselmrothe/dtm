Abstract

nitude of an reward to the speaker (small, medium, or large).
Children selected the biggest reward when a speaker used a
strong description (e.g. “The mouse picked up all of the carrots” if she indeed picked up all), but only a mid-sized award
for a weak description (e.g. “The mouse picked up some of
the carrots” for the same scene). Children may be sensitive
to the goodness of particular descriptions but display more
tolerance than adults on binary truth judgement tasks.
Overall, research on children’s abilities to compute scalar
implicatures indicates that their fragile performance may
have less to do with their general pragmatic knowledge per
se, and more to do with their knowledge of particular scales.
The Alternatives Hypothesis, proposed by Barner and colleagues (Barner & Bachrach, 2010; Barner, Brooks, & Bale,
2011), posits that children’s ability to compute scalar implicatures relies on their recognition of the relevant lexical alternatives (e.g., that use of the weaker term “some” conveys
a direct contrast with the stronger alternative “all”, thus implying some but not all). In other words, children’s pragmatic
inferences rely on their ability to consider relevant possible
alternative word choices that could have been used in place of
the ones the speaker chose. So even in supportive paradigms,
if children cannot bring to mind “all” when reasoning about
“some,” they will fail to make an implicature.
Children’s performance in implicature tasks increases
when they have stronger access to lexical alternatives, supporting this hypothesis. Evaluating performance in competitions where alternative outcomes are salient (Papafragou &
Musolino, 2003) and using contextually-accessible (ad-hoc)
scales (e.g., “the cat and the cow are sleeping” rather than
“some animals are sleeping”; Barner et al., 2011) both help
preschoolers make implicatures.
The Alternatives Hypothesis also predicts interactions
between the supportiveness of a task and children’s performance. For example, even three-year-olds show evidence of computing implicatures for ad-hoc contextualized scales when the task is a referential forced choice between possible interpretations (Stiller, Goodman, & Frank,
2014). Preschoolers also show some preliminary evidence
of computing scalar implicatures for quantifiers in a similar
forced-choice paradigm, albeit with prosodic support (Miller,
Schmitt, Chang, & Munn, 2005).
In sum, the Alternatives Hypothesis appears to provide a
promising account of the current patterns of preschoolers’
successes and failures in pragmatic implicature tasks. Nevertheless, work to date has varied widely in the particular scales,
tasks, and measures that were used, and the developmental
samples are relatively small while spanning several years of

Pragmatic implicatures—inferences that weak statements imply that stronger ones could not be used—are a popular case
study of children’s pragmatic development. A growing literature suggests that children make implicatures under certain
conditions, but their performance varies widely across tasks,
and few datasets allow direct comparisons between implicature
types. We designed a simple paradigm to address these issues.
In Experiment 1, we included both ad-hoc (contextual) and
scalar (quantifier) descriptions and found that 4-year-olds were
at ceiling in ad-hoc trials but had difficulty with scalar implicatures. In Experiment 2, 4-year-olds’ performance increased
when we included only scalar trials, but was still low. Across
both datasets, performance for “some” and “none” quantifiers
was positively correlated. Our work provides more precise
developmental data on the emergence of different implicature
computations and illustrates that preschoolers’ recognition of
implicatures relates both to their comprehension of particular
lexical items and also their recognition of relevant alternatives.
Keywords: Pragmatics; implicature; language development.

Introduction
Speakers tend to produce utterances that are informative
given their intended meaning. Implicatures are instances in
which a weak description (e.g. “I did some of my homework”) implies that a stronger alternative (that I did all of it) is
not true, or else a cooperative communicator would have used
the stronger case (Grice, 1975). Scalar implicatures rely on
lexical scales, or sets of related terms that are graded in meaning such as quantifiers (“some” vs. “all”), modals (“possibly”
vs. “definitely”), logical connectives (“or” vs. “and”), and
numerals (“one” vs. “two”) (Horn, 1972). Ad-hoc implicatures are contextually weak descriptions that negate stronger
interpretations (e.g. “I did my math homework” implies that I
did only my math, and not also my history homework). While
scalar and ad-hoc implicatures are similar in nature and simple for adults, they are often challenging for children. We investigate factors influencing children’s pragmatic inferences
across these types of descriptions.
Children’s processing of scalar implicatures is a focal case
study for pragmatic development. Although adults spontaneously compute scalar implicatures along lexical scales
like <SOME , ALL>, children’s performance on these scales
is variable even fairly late in development (Noveck, 2001;
Guasti et al., 2005). Children’s graded pattern of successes and failures across different tasks suggests that many
paradigms, particularly those requiring binary truth value
judgements for complex propositions, may underestimate
their pragmatic abilities (Guasti et al., 2005; Papafragou &
Musolino, 2003; Papafragou & Tantalou, 2004). For example, Katsos and Bishop (2011) had five-year-olds rate the felicity statements that described scenes by selecting the mag-

age. These concerns make it difficult to interpolate across
findings and draw strong inferences about contrasts between
contextually-supported (ad-hoc) and lexicalized (scalar) implicatures. Our current study aims to fill this gap.
We designed a simple referent selection task in which children were asked to select which of three book covers they
thought the experimenter was describing. Our design allowed
us to fully counterbalance the instructions children heard
across trials (ad-hoc vs. scalar descriptions crossed with implicature vs. unambiguous control targets), to examine both
within-subject patterns of responses and between-subject developmental patterns, and to reduce the demands of the task
by having children select the implied referent among three
visual alternatives.
In Experiment 1, we included both ad-hoc and scalar descriptions with implicature and control trials for each. Four–
year-olds were strong on ad-hoc trials (similar to previous
work, e.g. Stiller et al., 2014), but their performance on scalar
implicature trials was very low. In Experiment 2, we ran the
same task but replaced the ad-hoc trials so that all of the descriptions used scalar quantifiers. We found developmental
increases in performance for each trial type, and higher performance on implicature trials for 4-year-olds in this scalaronly version of the task. In both experiments, children’s pattern of responses on scalar implicature trials was bimodal and
strongly correlated with their performance on “none” (scalar
control) trials, providing some clues about the factors underlying success in scalar implicatures. Overall, our findings
suggest that scalar implicatures are difficult for preschoolers
even in supportive contexts, and that stronger recognition of
lexical alternatives boosts performance.

children were to make their best guess about which book she
was describing based on that clue. A breakdown of the trial
types and sample scripts is provided in Table 1.
Children began the task with a training trial in which each
of the covers featured a single unique item. Following this
initial trial, children saw 18 test trials with new sets of familiar items. Children were instructed to point to the book they
thought the experimenter was describing. If children pointed
to more than one book or their response was unclear, they
were reminded that the experimenter was talking about just
one book, and were asked to touch the one book they thought
she meant.
For ad-hoc trials (eight total), the experimenter described
the target using names of the images pictured. Ad-hoc control trials referred to unambiguous targets (e.g. “On the cover
of my book, there are dogs/birds” in Figure 1). Ad-hoc implicature trials required an inference about the speaker’s intended meaning: e.g. “On the cover of my book, there are
cats” could potentially refer to either the book with only cats
or the book with cats and birds, but the speaker’s decision to
describe only cats suggests that she is referring to the cover
with all cats and no birds, or else she would have mentioned
both types of animals or the ones unique to that cover (i.e.
birds).
For scalar trials (ten total), the experimenter described the
target using quantifiers. Scalar control trials referred to unambiguous targets using all or none (e.g. “On the cover of
my book, all/none of the pictures are cats”) or an unambiguous referent of some (e.g. “On the cover of my book, some of
the pictures are birds”). On scalar implicature trials, the experimenter used a weak quantifier in reference to the item pictured across two book covers (e.g. “On the cover of my book,
some of the pictures are cats”). Because the speaker used
a weak quantifier, the implicature is that she must mean the
cover with two cats and two birds, because if she had meant
the cover with only cats, she would have use the stronger
quantifier (all) instead.
Image sets were presented in a fixed order, counterbalanced
for target location and book triad positions. The description
condition (ad-hoc or scalar quantifier) and trial type (implicature or control) for each book set were randomized across
participants. The conditions (ad-hoc or scalar) and trial types
(implicature or control) were spaced as much as possible so
that two trials of the same type never occurred twice in a row.
Children enjoyed the task, responded quickly to the clues, and
often made statements such as, “I’m good at this!” although
they were not provided feedback about their selections. The
test session took about ten minutes to complete.

Experiment 1
Methods
Participants A planned sample of 48 children was recruited from Bing Nursery School at Stanford University.
Participants were recruited from two age groups: 24 4.0- to
4.5-year-olds (M = 4;2) and 24 4.5- to 5.0-year-olds (M =
4;7). Two additional children were excluded for stopping the
study early, and one was excluded due to experimenter error.
Stimuli Children were shown printed images of three book
covers, each depicting four familiar items (see Figure 1). An
initial training trial featured a single unique item on each
cover. For each of the 18 test trials, one book contained four
items of a kind (e.g. four dogs), one book contained a different set of four items (e.g. four cats), and one book contained
two pictures of a new set and two pictures repeated from one
of the other covers (e.g. two cats and two birds). Each set of
books featured a different set of familiar items.

Results
Children’s performance on all trial types is shown in Figure 2
(responses were coded as correct on implicature trials if children chose the implicature-consistent target). Across all of
the ad-hoc trial types, children were near ceiling in selecting
the intended target. Using a novel task, our finding replicates
previous work indicating that preschoolers can compute ad-

Procedure Participants were tested individually in a quiet
room at their preschool. The experimenter explained that they
would be playing a game in which she would think about one
of the three books on each page and give a clue about it. She
emphasized that she would only give one clue for each set, so

hoc implicatures (Stiller et al., 2014), and suggests that children can make such inferences even in the presence of varied
types of descriptions (control trials and scalar references).
Children’s performance on scalar trials was markedly different and much lower. We ran a logistic mixed effect model,
predicting correct responses as the interaction of age, condition (ad-hoc or scalar) and trial type (implicature or control), with random effects of participant and trial type. Performance was marginally lower for scalar trials than ad-hoc trials
(β = −8.02, p = .09), and there was a significant interaction
between condition and trial type, such that performance was
significantly worse on scalar implicature trials (β = 16.45,
p = .02). There was also a significant 3-way interaction between condition, trial type, and age, such that performance
on scalar implicature trials decreased with age (β = −4.16,
p < .01). There were no significant effects of adding trial
order (trials in the first half vs. second half of the experiment), indicating that performance did not change throughout
the course of the experiment.
Although children largely made correct choices on the all
trials, their responses were more varied for some and none
trials. Examining their patterns of responses more closely,
we ran Hartigan’s dip test and found significant bimodal
distributions for both some (D = .15, p < .0001) and none
(D = .20, p < .0001) trials, indicating that individuals tended
not to respond at chance, but either consistently correctly
or incorrectly on these trials. Additionally, children’s success on some and none trials was highly correlated1 (r = .47,
p < .001) such that children who performed better on some
trials also tended to perform better on none trials (see Figure
3). Performance on none and all trials (r = .11, p = .45) or
some and all trials (r = .01, p = .95) was not correlated.

alternatives (conveyed across trials), children were at chance
in their selections on scalar implicature trials.
We also found an unpredicted developmental change in
responses on none trials, corroborating recent work indicating that even older preschoolers show difficulty in the comprehension of negation in arbitrary contexts (Nordmeyer &
Frank, 2014). We had expected none trials to serve as a simple unambiguous control, but found that this term was difficult for children (and that success was correlated with implicature performance). Perhaps children’s implicature performance depends to some degree on familiarity with the both
ends of the quantifier scale (none—some—all). They may
need to recognize both extremes of the scale before consistently identifying the meaning of the intermediate, some term.
Alternatively, another mediating factor (e.g., inhibitory control) might be responsible for the correlation we observed.
We return to this issue in the General Discussion.
Finally, although our goal was to examine pragmatic development by comparing children’s performance across a variety of inference trials, we wondered if including both ad-hoc
and scalar quantifier descriptions led children to form expectations about the speaker that influenced their responses. We
were concerned that their overwhelming success on ad-hoc
implicature trials (e.g. “On the cover of my book, there are
cats”) might lead them to misinterpret the intention of some
in scalar implicature trials from “... some of the pictures are

Discussion
Overall, we found that scalar implicatures were hard for children in our task. We wondered why this difficulty might be
the case, given that we had tried to reduce as many task demands as possible in our task. Despite the presence of both
visual alternatives (via the three selection choices) and lexical

Stimuli The same materials were used as in Experiment 1.
The only changes made were to the scripts, such that ad-hoc
trials were removed and all trials were converted into scalar
quantifier references (Table 1). The 18 test trials contained
six control all trials (e.g. “On the cover of my book, all of the
pictures are cats”), six control none trials (“On the cover of
my book, none of the pictures are cats”), and six scalar implicature some trials (“On the cover of my book, some of the
pictures are cats”). We removed unambiguous references to
some in order to balance the trial types more carefully, and so
that the quantifier always referenced the item pictured across
two book sets (e.g. for the cats book set pictured in Figure
1, children heard references to none, some or all cats). Image sets were presented in a fixed order, counterbalanced for
target location and triad order. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of three scripts, with a pseudo-randomized
trial order such every book set was referred to by each quantifier type (all, none or some), and the same trial type never
occurred twice in a row.

cats” to “... there are some cats.” If children are forming expectations about the speaker that override their sensitivity to
the particular word choices in the referential expression, then
their performance may be biased by the presence of the adhoc trials. To investigate this idea, we removed ad-hoc trials
and ran a scalar-only version of the study.

Procedure

The procedure was identical to Experiment 1.

Results and Discussion

Experiment 2

Children’s performance increased with age for all trial types
(Figure 4). All age groups were strongest on the all trials,
and the oldest children (4.5–5.0 year-olds) were the only age
group above chance for none trials (t = 3.09, p = .01); this
group was marginally above chance for some trials (t = 1.85,
p = .09).
We ran a logistic mixed effect model, predicting correct responses as the interaction of age and trial type (none, some or

To investigate whether preschoolers would show increased
sensitivity to individual quantifier use in the absence of competing ad-hoc descriptions, we ran a version of Experiment
1 using only scalar quantifiers. Additionally, in order to explore the developmental course of scalar implicature comprehension, we extended our sample to span the age range from
3–5 years, broken into half-year age groups.

all), with random effects of trial type by participant. Surprisingly, the only significant effect that emerged was age, such
that performance increased across trials as children got older
(β = 20, p < .001). We added trial order (first or second half
of the experiment) to the model but it did not interact with any
variables, indicating that performance did not change over
the course of the experiment. The lack of trial type effects
in the main model was caused by the participant-level random effects structure and suggests that trial-type effects were
not stable across participants (Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily,
2013).
Consistent with the findings from the mixed effects model,
we again found significant bimodal patterns of responses
for both some (D = .12, p < .0001) and none (D = .15,
p < .0001) trials. And again, these trial types were highly
correlated with one another (r = .52, p < .001; Figure 5).
As an exploratory analysis, we ran another version of the
mixed effects model removing the random effect of trial type.
In addition to a main effect of age (t = 1.88, p < .01), this
model revealed that performance on some trials was lower
than all trials (t = −7.69, p < 01), and marginally reduced
from none trials (t = 3.03, p = .09). We also found interactions between trial type and age, such that there was a greater
difference between younger children’s performance on some
and all trials (t = 2.84, p < .001) and some and none trials
(t = 0.90, p = .05).
Overall, children’s success in selecting the speaker’s intended target increased as children got older. Our results do
not allow a strong inference about the cause of this developmental change, but several hints were present in the data.
First, the bimodal and correlated patterns of responses for
none and some suggests that children’s knowledge of the full
quantifier paradigm is not yet adult-like in their preschool
years. One possible explanation is that they are learning that
both none and all contrast with some in parallel. Second,
there was a notable contrast between performance on some
trials in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, indicating that the
presence of other (ad-hoc) trial types likely decreased children’s implicature computation in our first experiment, and
supporting the idea that pragmatic competition extends beyond the specific lexical scale being used (Degen & Tanenhaus, 2014).

removing the ad-hoc trials increased older children’s performance on scalar implicature. Our findings suggest that 4year-olds are able to compute scalar implicatures, but their
performance is fragile and reliant on contextual cues.
Our work contributes to the existing literature in a number of ways. First, it offers a novel paradigm that is less
complicated than many other implicature tasks, leading us
to feel more confident that our results reflect children’s true
sensitivity rather than inadvertent task demands. Each test
set remained visible to children, and they were merely asked
to select which picture they thought was the referent of the
speaker’s description. Second, the relatively high number of
trials both helped strengthen our analytical power and also
offered the possibility for children to identify lexical alternatives as the study progressed (although we did not find that
their performance significantly changed over the course of either experiment, cf. Skordos & Papafragou, 2014). Third,
we were able to not only compare performance across age
groups, but also to examine individual patterns of responses
across the different trial types. This design helped us determine that preschoolers’ performance on scalar implicature tri-

General Discussion
We designed a simple task to test children’s sensitivity to a
variety of word choice cues in a single paradigm, allowing us
to investigate patterns of pragmatic development both withinand between-subjects. We minimized task demands by asking participants to select the speaker’s intended referent from
among three visual alternatives. In Experiment 1, we replicated the finding that preschoolers can compute ad-hoc implicatures, though we found poor performance on scalar implicatures. In Experiment 2, preschoolers’ comprehension of
all scalar quantifier terms in the task increased with age, and

als was bimodal and highly related to their performance on
none trials, which we would have been unlikely to uncover
in a purely between-subjects implicature design without controls.
Our findings support the Alternatives Hypothesis (Barner
& Bachrach, 2010; Barner et al., 2011). First, our ad-hoc
trials in Experiment 1 show that preschoolers had no difficulty generally making inferences about contextual descriptions when they are obvious from the context. Performance
on scalar trials also appeared to be related to the recognition
of a broad set of lexical alternatives, due to both preschoolers’ increasing ability to compute scalar implicatures with age
(presumably a proxy for familiarity with scalemates) and due
to the differences in performance across Experiments 1 and
2. Overall, these patterns of results support the idea that children’s ability to compute implicatures relates to their ability
to reason about what other possible utterances a speaker could
have used instead.
The correlated responses for none and some trials in both
Experiments 1 and 2 present an interesting puzzle. None is
not typically considered part of the same Horn scale as some
and all (because “all” entails some, but “some” does not entail none—and in fact entails the opposite), but it is nonetheless a lexical contrast along the same quantifier scale. One
possibility is that children’s knowledge of the whole quantifier scale plays a role in scalar implicature, though knowledge
of logically-false alternatives is not involved in the computations outlined by most theoretical accounts of (e.g. Barner
et al., 2011). Another is that performance on none and
some trials may be correlated because both scalar implicature
and negation comprehension might require inhibiting another
response—the positive alternative in the negative case, and
the stronger alternative in the implicature case. More research
will be required to distinguish these possibilities.
One pattern in our data is more difficult to reconcile with
the Alternatives Hypothesis: Children’s performance did not
change over the course of either experiment. We had expected that, if children’s difficulties with scalar implicature
were due to a lack of recognition of the contrastive relationship between “some” and “all,” that this relationship would
be revealed by the two words’ consistent use in contrasting
references over the course of the many trials that each child
completed (Skordos & Papafragou, 2014). The lack of trial
order effects we observed could indicate that children in our
task did not yet have strong enough comprehension of these
terms for contrastive use to matter, or alternatively that our
referent-selection task eliminated the problem of summoning the contrasting term to mind and instead foregrounded
some other inferential challenge (perhaps that of inhibitory
control).
In sum, our work suggests that children can draw implicatures based on some lexical choices—such as in the case of
ad-hoc implicatures—but they still struggle with quantifierbased scalar implicatures until relatively late. Their computation of scalar implicatures increases in supportive contexts,

but their inferences are fragile and depend on their knowledge
of lexical items.
