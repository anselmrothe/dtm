Abstract
Fractions knowledge is essential to everyday life, yet many
children and adults struggle to accurately represent fractions.
This is the first study to investigate adults’ confidence
judgments and eye fixations as they solved fractions number
line estimation, magnitude comparison, and magnitude
ordering tasks. Educational implications are discussed.

Children’s and Adults’ Difficulty Representing
Fractions Magnitudes
Fluency with rational numbers—fractions, decimals, and
percentages—is important in the everyday lives of adults.
For example, rational numbers are essential to knowing how
to: double a recipe, determine the total interest paid on a
mortgage, calculate the final cost of an item on sale for 75%
off the original price, assess the likelihood of contracting a
communicable disease, etc. Unfortunately, children and
adults often struggle to accurately represent fractions (see
Siegler, Fazio, Bailey, & Zhou, 2013 for a review).
What makes it so difficult to correctly represent fractions?
Students often mistakenly extend their knowledge about
whole numbers to fractions (Ni & Zhou, 2005; Siegler,
Thompson, & Schneider, 2011). What is true of whole
numbers is not true of all numbers in general. For example,
12 is larger than 9, but 1/12 is not larger than 1/9. The
uniting factor, according to Siegler and colleagues’
integrated theory of whole numbers and fractions, is that the
magnitudes of whole numbers and fractions can be
represented on number lines.
The Common Core State Standards recommend that
fractions instruction begin in third grade with students
representing
fractions
on
number
lines
(http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/3/NF/). Even
though fractions instruction begins early in elementary
school, students continue to struggle well into adulthood to
accurately represent fractions concepts—likely because it is
quite difficult to inhibit the plethora of whole number
knowledge that they have amassed. In one famous example

(Carpenter et al., 1981), more eighth graders chose incorrect
answers (19 or 21) to a simple fractions addition problem
(12/13 + 7/8) than chose the correct answer (2). Only about
half of sixth and eighth graders were able to correctly order
fractions from smallest to largest magnitude (Mazzocco &
Devlin, 2008; NCTM, 2007). Fifth graders often make
errors when comparing decimal fractions (Rittle-Johnson,
Siegler, & Alibali, 2001). Though it is true that all threedigit whole numbers are larger than all two-digit whole
numbers, a three-digit decimal is not necessarily larger than
a two-digit decimal (e.g., .539 < .68). Fifth, sixth, and even
eighth graders often use non-optimal strategies as they
estimate fractions on number lines. For instance, some
students verbally report attending only to the denominator
when estimating the location of a fraction (e.g., a student
marks 3/19 closer to the 1 than to the 0 on a 0-1 number line
because he noted that 19 is a large number; Siegler &
Thompson, 2014; Siegler et al., 2011).
Problems representing fractions persist into high school
and college. Eleventh graders failed to accurately translate
between equivalent rational numbers (e.g., .029 = 29/1000,
Kloosterman, 2010), and college students failed to
accurately estimate the location of common numerator
problems on number lines (e.g., 1/60 was placed closer to
1/1 than to 1/1440; Opfer & DeVries, 2008).
Fractions are integral to success in algebra, and success in
algebra is related to access to higher education, graduation
from college, and later earning capacity (National
Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008). A recent longitudinal
analysis indicated that early fractions and division
knowledge predicted success in algebra and overall
mathematics achievement five or six years later, even after
controlling for other types of mathematical knowledge,
general intelligence, working memory, and family income
and level of education (Siegler, et al., 2012). Accurate
knowledge of fractions is crucial to later success in life.

Confidence Judgments
Confidence judgments are subjective evaluations of whether
one has given a correct response to a specific problem
(Dunlosky & Metcalfe, 2008). In general, judgments tend to
be overconfident (i.e., judgments are higher than actual

2571

performance) when evaluating performance across a variety
of cognitive tasks (Shepperd, Klein, Waters, & Weinstein,
2013). Confidence judgments are strongly influenced by the
difficulty of the material being assessed in that more
difficult material is associated with underconfidence (i.e.,
judgments lower than actual performance), while less
difficult material is associated with overconfidence
(Dunlosky & Metcalfe, 2008).
Confidence judgments play an important role in selfregulated learning in that confidence judgments influence
the likelihood of correcting errors (Dunlosky & Rawson,
2012). Increasing the accuracy of confidence judgments
appears to be an effective non-cognitive factor in improving
school performance (e.g., Stankov, Morony, & Lee, 2014).
Confidence judgments yield unique benefits to learning
mathematics. Adults with greater numeracy and more
accurate approximate number sense (ANS) were more
accurate in their confidence judgments than those with
lower numeracy and less accurate ANS (Winman, Juslin,
Lindskog, Nilsson, & Kerimi, 2014). Children with more
accurate confidence judgments achieved greater gains in
mathematics than those with less accurate confidence
judgments (Rinne & Mazzocco, 2014).

Eye Tracking
Researchers have used the eye-tracking paradigm to
investigate children and adults’ whole number knowledge.
Schneider and colleagues (Schneider et al., 2008)
investigated first through third graders’ eye fixations as they
estimated the location of whole numbers in the 0-100 range.
The children fixated their gaze at the endpoints (0 and 100)
and the midpoint (50) of the number line. These eyetracking results corroborate with verbal reports that children
subjectively impose reference points on number lines as
they estimate the location of fractions (Siegler & Thompson,
2014; Siegler et al., 2011) and results that response times
are faster when the to-be-estimated number’s location is
closer to subjective landmarks (Ashcraft & Moore, 2012).
There may be a mismatch between children’s explicit
understanding, as measured by behavioral responses and
verbal reports, and implicit understanding, as measured by
eye fixations (Heine et al., 2010). Though behavioral data
indicated that first graders possessed a less accurate
representation of numbers, their eye-tracking results were
consistent with a more accurate representation.
Adults’ eye movements on number line estimation tasks
in the 0-1000 range were highly related to the correct
location of the to-be-estimated numbers (Sullivan, Juhasz,
Slattery, & Barth, 2011). These adults showed a preference
for fixating near the midpoint (500) as compared to the
regions around 250 and 750. Huber, Moller, and Nuerk
(2014) reported eye-tracking evidence from adults as they
compared fraction magnitudes and found that denominators
were fixated upon more frequently than numerators.

The Current Study
The current study served as a first step to understanding the
difference between adults’ and children’s understanding of
fractions. College-aged adults completed three tasks: 1)
position-to-number number line estimation, 2) magnitude
comparison, and 3) magnitude ordering. After answering
each problem, participants made a confidence judgment on a
four-point scale ranging from not so sure to totally sure.
Their eye fixations were tracked.
Hypotheses. We expected that, on average, adults would be
fairly accurate on our battery of tasks, but confidence
judgments and eye fixations would serve as indicators of
individual differences in performance. Our study
investigated three main hypotheses. First, we expected to
find an association between confidence judgments and
overall performance, such that participants would report
feeling more confident when their estimates, comparisons,
and rank ordering of fractions were more accurate. Second,
both confidence judgments and eye fixations were expected
to vary by problem difficulty. For instance, we anticipated
lower confidence judgments and longer eye fixations for
more difficult problems. “Difficult” problems were assumed
to be trials in which the participant is enticed to employ a
heuristic that would lead to an incorrect answer. For the
magnitude comparison and ordering tasks, a difficult
problem may be one in which the larger fraction has both a
smaller numerator and denominator (e.g., 3/4 vs. 5/16).
Participants may decide that the larger fraction is not the
correct response given that its component parts are smaller
in value compared to the other fraction(s). Similarly, when
the larger fraction has a larger denominator (e.g., 13/17 vs.
11/15), participants may decide that the larger fraction is not
the correct response based on the heuristic that all things
being equal, large denominators indicate smaller fractional
values. Another type of difficult problem may be one in
which the fractions’ decimal equivalents are close in value.
Participants are more accurate and respond quicker when
the magnitudes are more distant (e.g., 1/9 vs. ½ = .11 vs.
.50) as compared to closer (e.g., 5/6 vs. 7/8 = .83 vs. .88).
This provides evidence for the distance effect in fractions
(Dehaene, Dehaene-Lambertz, & Cohen, 1998; Siegler et
al., 2011). Finally, for the number line estimation task,
difficult problems were considered to be trials in which the
hatch mark was located far away from an experimenterimposed landmark (0, 1) or a participant-imposed landmark
(midpoint). Third, we hypothesized that adults’ fixations
would suggest the types of strategies used during each task.
For example, we expected the number of fixations on
denominators to predict performance when comparing or
ordering fractions with common numerators but not
fractions with common denominators. Finally, for the
number line estimation task, we expected participants would
fixate more frequently on the hatch mark indicated on the
number line when it was located further from a subjective
(e.g., midpoint) or objective (e.g., endpoint) landmark
(Siegler et al, (2011) and Schneider et al. (2008).

What is the Value Added by Confidence Judgments and
Eye Tracking Paradigms? To our knowledge, no previous
studies have assessed adults’ level of confidence as they
completed fraction number line estimation, magnitude
comparison, and magnitude ordering tasks in an eyetracking paradigm. Eye tracking and confidence judgments
will provide converging supporting evidence for previously
reported fractions results. For instance, analyses of
children’s verbal reports (Siegler et al., 2011; Siegler &
Thompson, 2014) have provided insights into the types of
strategies that participants use to solve fractions problems,
but sometimes participants find it difficult to explicitly
express their thought processes. Implicit fractions
understanding may outpace explicit performance (and
verbal reports), and eye tracking and confidence judgments
could provide some additional insights on the
developmental progressions in fractions learning across the
lifespan. Knowing where adults fixate when completing
fractions magnitude tasks could indicate why they make the
types of mistakes that they do. These insights could inform
educational lessons.

Method
Participants
Fourteen undergraduate students were recruited from an
introductory psychology course at a large Midwestern
university (M age = 20 years, SD = 1.58; range = 18-23
years; 6 males; 78% Caucasian, 14% Asian, 7% African
American). Participants received course credit.
All participants completed the magnitude comparison task
before the ordering task. However, some participants (N =
8) received these tasks first followed by the number line
estimation task. One participant’s number line estimation
data was not recorded due to equipment failure.

Procedure
Participants were seated in front of a Tobii T-60XL eyetracker monitor. Participants were told that they would
complete three tasks assessing their understanding of
fractions and that their eye movements would be recorded
throughout the study. They were also told that, after each
trial, they would be asked to rate how confident they were in
their performance. Confidence judgments were based on a
4-point scale (1-not that sure, 2-kind of sure, 3-pretty sure,
4-totally sure) and were reported either verbally (magnitude
comparison, ordering) or electronically (number line
estimation). Each participant completed a non-numerical
eye-tracking calibration exercise before beginning.
Position-to-Number
Number
Line
Estimation
Participants estimated the position of a hatch mark on a
number line. Each number line had a left endpoint labeled
“0”, a right end-point labeled “1”, and a blue hatch mark
corresponding to the location of one of the following
fractions: 1/19, 1/15, 1/12, 1/10, 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 2/9, 1/4,
2/7, 3/10, 1/3, 3/8, 5/12, 4/9, 5/9, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6,

7/8, 10/11, 13/14. Twenty-six number lines were presented
one at a time, and participants were instructed to estimate
the fraction located at each hatch mark. They responded by
typing the fraction into a text box displayed below the
number line. After each trial, participants were prompted to
rate how confident they were in their answer. Both the
fraction estimates and confidence judgments were made
electronically through Qualtrics online survey software.
Number lines were presented on the eye-tracking monitor,
and areas of interest were created using Tobii Studio 3.2.
Magnitude Comparison Participants determined which of
two fractions was larger. Forty fraction pairs (adopted from
Fazio et al., 2014) were presented one at a time on the eyetracking monitor. Each pair came from one of four ratio bins
(determined by dividing the larger fraction by the smaller
fraction): 1.15-1.28, 1.28-1.43, 1.48-1.65, and 2.46-2.71.
Additionally, each bin included five types of trials (two of
each); relative to the smaller fraction, the larger fraction had
either 1) a larger numerator and an equal denominator (e.g.,
7/10 and 6/10); 2) an equal numerator and a smaller
denominator (e.g., 16/17 and 16/20); 3) a larger numerator
and a larger denominator (e.g., 15/20 and 5/8); 4) a larger
numerator and a smaller denominator (e.g., 13/14 and
12/16); or 5) a smaller numerator and a smaller denominator
(e.g., 7/11 and 10/20).
Participants were encouraged to respond as quickly and
accurately as possible. The fractions remained on the screen
until the participant responded. After each trial, participants
provided verbal confidence judgments.
Magnitude Ordering Participants ordered sets of fractions
from smallest to largest. On each of ten trials, participants
saw three fractions on the eye-tracking monitor, each
outlined with a colored rectangle. The fraction on the left
was outlined in red, the middle fraction in green, and the
fraction on the right in blue. Participants made verbal
responses by specifying the color of the fraction (rather than
the fraction itself) when ordering (e.g., “blue, red, green”).
There were five types of trials (two of each); relative to
the other two fractions, the larger fraction had either 1) an
equal numerator and smaller denominator (e.g., 3/4, 3/15,
and 3/6); 2) a larger numerator and an equal denominator
(e.g., 8/9, 6/9, 3/9); 3) a larger numerator and a larger
denominator (e.g., 13/17, 7/15, and 2/9); 4) a larger
numerator and a smaller denominator (e.g., 10/15, 5/20, and
1/19); or 5) a smaller numerator and a smaller denominator
(e.g., 4/6, 5/20, and 7/17). The fractions remained on the
screen until the participant ordered all three fractions. After
each trial, participants provided verbal confidence
judgments. The experimenter recorded all responses. For
both the magnitude ordering and comparison tasks,
confidence judgments were recorded, and areas of interest
were created in Tobii Studio 3.2.

Results
Hypothesis 1: Confidence & Accuracy
Position-to-Number Number Line Estimation The
accuracy of number line estimates were measured by
percent absolute error (PAE): PAE = (|Participant’s
Estimate – Correct Answer|)/Numerical Range. For
example, if the location of a hatch mark corresponded to 3/4
on a 0-1 scale, and a participant estimated its location to be
2/5, the PAE would be 35% ([|.40-.75|]/1 * 100). Smaller
PAEs indicate more accurate estimates. On average,
participants were not very confident in their estimates (M =
2.33, SD = .73), and these judgments were not associated
with overall PAE (M = 5.31, SD = 1.84%), r = -.07, p >
.05. Table 1 shows PAE and confidence judgments for each
trial type; SDs are in parentheses in all Tables.

Difficulty

Magnitude Comparison Confidence was high (M = 3.45,
SD = .37) and associated with overall accuracy (M =
89.68%, SD = 12.71%), r = .753, p < .01. Table 2 shows
mean accuracy and confidence judgments for each bin.
Confidence judgments and accuracy were correlated within
Bins 1 (r = .64, p = .014), 2 (r = .72, p < .01), and 4 (r = .65,
p = .012). Confidence judgments were also related to
accuracy on trials with equal numerators (e.g., 16/17 vs.
16/20), r = .80, p = < .01, when the larger fraction had both
a larger numerator and denominator (e.g., 15/20 vs. 5/8), r =
.57, p < .05, and when the larger fraction had both a smaller
numerator and denominator (e.g., 7/16 vs. 8/21), r = .67, p =
.01.

Magnitude Ordering Confidence judgments were high (M
= 3.31, SD = .45) and associated with overall accuracy (M =
80.24%, SD = 18.04), r = .73, p < .01. Confidence
judgments were also related to accuracy on trials in which
the fractions shared a common dominator, and the largest

Position-to-Number Number Line Estimation As
predicted, participants’ confidence judgments were lowest
on trials in which the hatch mark was between landmarks
(see Table 2). Moreover, participants were significantly
more confident when the hatch mark was close to “0”
compared to when it was not near a landmark, t(13) = 2.21,
p = .045. Interestingly, confidence was highest for “close to
0” trials even though participants were significantly less
accurate on these trials compared to the other trial types (all
ps < .05).
Overall, participants fixated on the hatch mark (M = 2.15,
SD = .69; range = 1.07-3.79) more often than both the
endpoints, “0” (M = 1.24, SD = 1.18, range = 0-6.57), t(24)
= -3.13, p < .01, and “1” (M = 1.24, SD = 1.73; range = .295.36), t(24) = -2.85, p < .01. Contrary to our predictions,
fixations on the hatch mark, midpoint, and endpoints did not
vary by problem difficulty.
Magnitude Comparison As predicted, participants were
more confident on “easier” trials. Table 1 shows that
confidence was highest on trials with the largest magnitude
differences (i.e., bins 3 and 4). Consistent with the distance
effect, Bin 4 confidence judgments were significantly higher
than trials within Bin 1, t(13) = -2.56, p = .024, and Bin 2,
t(13) = -2.92, p = .012. Contrary to our predictions,
participants were more confident when the larger fraction
had both a smaller numerator and denominator (M = 3.50,
SD = .43) than when both fractions shared a common
denominator (M = 3.31, SD = .56), t(13) = 2.40, p = .03.
Confidence was also higher when the fractions shared a
common numerator compared to denominator (M = 3.53 vs.
3.31, respectively), t(13) = 2.58, p = .02.
Fixations also varied by problem difficulty. On “easy”
trials, participants tended to fixate longer on the larger,
correct fraction while the reverse was found for more
difficult trials (see Table 4).

Magnitude Ordering As predicted, participants’
confidence judgments were significantly higher for “easy”
trials (i.e., when the fractions shared a common numerator
or denominator) compared to “difficult” trials (i.e., when the
largest fraction had a larger denominator, or both a smaller
numerator and denominator) (all ps < .05). Confidence was
also significantly higher for trials in which the largest
fraction had a larger numerator and smaller denominator
compared to when it had both a larger numerator and
denominator, t(13) = 3.89, p < .01.

Hypothesis 3: Fixations & Strategy Use
Position-to-Number Number Line Estimation As
mentioned above, participants tended to fixate on the hatch
mark more so than the endpoints or midpoint.
Magnitude Comparison Consistent with Huber et al.’s
(2014) results, participants tended to fixate more on
denominators (M = 2.34, SD = .53) than numerators (M =
1.78, SD = .74), t(39) = -5.58, p < .01. Contrary to our
predictions, however, participants were no more likely to
fixate on numerators when the denominators were equal (M
= 1.64 and 2.37, respectively) or on denominators when the
numerators were equal (M = 2.27 and 1.82, respectively),
ps > .05.
Magnitude Ordering Participants tended to fixate more on
numerators (M = 4.13, SD = 1.05) than denominators (M =
3.44, SD = 1.28), t(29) = 3.15, p < .01. Note that this is a
pattern that differed from the magnitude comparison task
results. Although fixations on the numerators did not vary
by trial type, fixations on the denominator did. Interestingly,
participants looked at the denominators more on trials in
which the numerators were more informative (e.g., 6/9, 3/9,
8/9) compared to trials in which the denominators were
more informative (e.g., 3/15, 3/4, 3/6), (M = 2.26, SD = .60,
and M = 2.11, SD = 1.72, respectively), t(13) = 2.92, p <
.01.

Discussion
Understanding fractions is difficult because prior knowledge
about number, specifically knowledge about number
magnitudes, often conflicts with correct fraction
interpretation. For example, larger whole number integers

indicate increasingly greater magnitudes (e.g., 20 is larger
than 5), however, the same number presented as a
denominator indicates a smaller magnitude (e.g., 1/20 is
smaller than 1/5). The current study was the first to
investigate attention to different features of fractions
comparing objective, behavioral data (e.g., eye tracking) and
self-reports (confidence judgments) across three different
fraction tasks.
Consistent with our first hypothesis, adults’ confidence
judgments were associated with accuracy in both the
fraction magnitude comparison and ordering tasks. This
association was not found in the position-to-number line
estimation task, however. Although the average PAE was
fairly low, participants tended to report being less confident
in their performance. It is possible that participants found
the position-to-number version of the number line task to be
particularly difficult and underestimated their performance.
Moreover, accuracy on this task was not associated with
accuracy on the other two tasks suggesting that this version
of the number line estimation task may not tap the same
kind of magnitude knowledge as the comparison and
ordering tasks. For example, participants could have solved
the number line task simply by choosing a denominator,
segmenting the line based on that number, and then
counting up the line until they reached the hatch mark.
Future work will need to determine whether this version of
the number line estimation actually taps fraction magnitude
knowledge.
In line with our second hypothesis, confidence judgments
varied by problem difficulty. “Easier” problems tended to
receive higher confidence judgments. Fixation patterns also
varied by task difficulty, but only for the magnitude
comparison task. Participants tended to fixate longer on the
larger fraction when it shared a common numerator or
denominator with the comparison fraction, suggesting a link
between strategy and accuracy.
Contrary to our third hypothesis, participants tended to
look at uninformative problem components (e.g., greater
looking at the denominators in the comparison task even
though they were equal). Moreover, during number line
estimation, participants tended to fixate on the hatch mark
regardless of its distance from the endpoints or midpoint.
These findings suggest that even adults sometimes use poor
strategies when assessing fraction magnitude. Interestingly,
the magnitude comparison and ordering tasks promote
different fixation patterns. The latter task is inherently more
difficult than the comparison task (i.e., three magnitude
comparisons as compared to two). Perhaps this level of
difficulty led participants to quickly default to an immature
strategy (i.e., focusing only on numerators; see Siegler &
Thompson, 2014 for a similar result). Future research will
need to determine why two tasks that tap the same kind of
knowledge promote different strategies (e.g., focusing on
numerators vs. denominators).
The current study has educational implications and was a
first step to understanding how to help children who are just
beginning to learn about fractions. Given that even adults

2575

tend to focus on uninformative components when
comparing fractions (e.g., common denominators),
instructors should emphasize that looking at denominators,
for example, is most informative when the numerators are
equal. In addition, highlighting trials on which the student
was confident, yet incorrect, may help learners more
accurately calibrate their confidence level and more
effectively allocate their resources for studying fractional
values.
