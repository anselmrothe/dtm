Abstract
Symbolic artifacts present a challenge to theories of
neurocognitive processing due to their dual nature: they are
both physical objects and vehicles of social meanings. While
their physical properties can be read of the surface structure,
the meaning of symbolic artifacts depends on their
embeddedness in cultural practices. In this study, participants
built models of LEGO bricks to illustrate their understanding
of abstract concepts. Subsequently, they were scanned with
fMRI while presented to photographs of their own and others’
models. When participants attended to the meaning of the
models, we observed activations associated with social
cognition and semantics. In contrast, when attending to the
physical properties, we observed activations related to object
recognition and manipulation. Furthermore, when contrasting
own and others’ models, we found activations in areas
associated with autobiographical memory and agency. Our
findings support a view of symbolic artifacts as neurocognitive trails of human social interactions.

Introduction
A central human characteristic is our profound engagement
with material objects and technologies. Like no other
species we actively shape, explore and exploit our material
surroundings to construct cultural and cognitive niches
(Clark, 2006; Laland, Odling-Smee, & Feldman, 2000).
While our material inventions include sophisticated tools for
instrumental and pragmatic engagement of the environment,
another broad class, symbolic artifacts, does its work by
virtue of meaning. Objects such as national flags, religious
symbols, artworks, road signs, pictorial representations etc.
are imbued with social significance as they are developed,
negotiated and engaged in a variety of cultural practices.
More than mere physical objects, we thus experience them
as vehicles of social meaning: a red traffic light does not

present any physical impediment to movement, and yet it
(most often) stops us. This raises fundamental questions
concerning the neuro-cognitive status of symbolic artifacts:
which patterns of functional activations are related to the
perception of social meaning in objects?
Previous brain-imaging studies have focused on the
distinction between social versus non-social, or animate
versus inanimate stimuli, and report dissociable networks of
brain areas in reaction to these categories (Caramazza &
Shelton, 1998; Gobbini et al., 2011; Naselaris, Stansbury, &
Gallant, 2012). For instance the dorso-medial prefrontal
cortex has been suggested to activate only when participants
make judgments about other people and not objects
(Mitchell, Heatherton, & Macrae, 2002; Mitchell, Neil
Macrae, & Banaji, 2005). The assumption behind these
studies is that stimuli come in ontologically pre-defined
categories - for instance all objects are considered nonsocial, while people are social - and patterns of functional
brain activations are interpreted according to these specific
categories.
However, as previously argued, symbolic artifacts
constitute a challenge to this literature due to their double
nature: they are simultaneously physical entities and
vehicles of non-tangible cultural meanings (Clark, 2006;
Hutchins, 2005), and this implies that they might give rise to
distinctive patterns of functional brain activations according
to how they are approached. Additionally, while their
physical nature is easily appreciable, their social meaning is
often not fully transparent to the casual newcomer, but
critically depends on participation in cultural practices and
trajectories of actual use in social interactions (Hutchins,
2008; Tylén, Fusaroli, Bundgaard, & Østergaard, 2013).
The complex social nature of symbolic artifacts motivates
a different set of hypotheses concerning their neurocognitive
bases: Functional brain activation will be modulated by i)
the interpretive attitude by which we approach the objects

2446

(as physical entities or as meaningful symbols), and ii) by
our familiarity with the socio-cultural practices constituting
the meaning of the objects. In other words, if socially
symbolic dimensions are contextually actualized, we expect
objects to evoke activity in the brain areas related to social
cognition and semantics such as mPFC, TPJ and IFG
(Tylén, Allen, Hunter, & Roepstorff, 2012; Tylén,
Wallentin, & Roepstorff, 2009). Furthermore, we expect
this activity to be modulated by participation in the social
history of the object (Mano et al., 2011). In contrast, if the
bare physical properties of the same artifacts are profiled,
we expect them to activate areas related to object
recognition and manipulation, such as ventral temporal and
motor areas (Bar et al., 2001; Binkofski et al., 1999). To
investigate these predictions we designed a two-part study
in which participants were instructed to individually and
collectively build their understanding of abstract concepts
using LEGO blocks. On the following day participants were
shown pictures of LEGO models built by themselves or
others while they were scanned with fMRI. In the scanner
they were given assignments that primed them to perceive
the LEGO constructs either as bare physical structures or as
vehicles of socially constituted meaning.

Materials and Methods
Participants
30 participants (15 f, mean age 23.6, sd 2.6) were recruited
among students of Aarhus University and received monetary
compensation for their participation. All participants were
right-handed, native speakers of Danish, with no history of
neurological or mental problems. Informed consent was
obtained in a manner approved by the local research ethical
committee.

Design and Procedure
The experiment was carried out as a two-part study over two
days. On the first day, participants were engaged in
individual and collective LEGO construction activities. On
the following day participants went through an fMRI brain
scan in which they were subjected to photographic stimuli
depicting the products of the preceding day’s individual and
collective LEGO constructions.
The LEGO construction activity The first day LEGO
construction activity was organized as a two-condition
within-group contrast: collective vs. individual. Participants
were organized in mixed-gender groups of four to six.
Group members did not know each other in advance.
Participants of each group were organized around a table
facing each other. Two simpler practice trials served to
familiarize them with each other and the LEGO materials.
After that, groups underwent an interleaved series of six
individual and six collective LEGO construction tasks of
each five minutes. In the construction tasks, participants
were instructed to use LEGO blocks to illustrate their
understanding of six abstract concepts: ‘responsibility’,
‘collaboration’, ‘knowledge’, ‘justice’, ’safety’ and
‘tolerance’. The concepts were selected to be challenging to

build, yet sufficiently common in public discourse that
participants would have an opinion about them. The LEGO
materials were in all cases a LEGO Serious Play Starter Kit
consisting of 214 mixed pieces (standards bricks in varying
shapes and colors, wheels, LEGO people, etc.). In order to
constrain variability of complexity and size of the models,
participants were instructed to build their models within the
limits of an A5 (5.8 x 8.3 inch) piece of cardboard.
In individual trials, participants sat quietly and
constructed their own models. In collective trials
participants freely interacted to construct joint models. After
each trial, participants were asked to briefly explain their
model. The experiment was divided in two 3-concepts
sessions separated by a 20 min. break. Two video cameras
consecutively recorded the construction activities and after
each construction trial the resulting LEGO models were
photographically documented with a Canon digital camera.
The fMRI study On the following day, participants came
back to the lab individually for an fMRI brain scanning
session. In the scanner, they were presented with
photographic stimuli depicting resulting models from the
LEGO construction activities. These belonged to four
conditions making up a 2-by-2 factorial design with the
factors collective/individual and own/other: 1) models that
the participant made with her group, 2) models that the
participant made individually, 3) models made by another
group, and 4) models made by another individual (from
another group). All corresponding LEGO models were
presented twice from two different perspectives in a
randomized order, each time accompanied by one of two
rating tasks: a ‘meaning property’ and a ‘physical property’
task. The tasks were intended to modulate participants’
attitude to the stimuli, inspecting the models for either their
meaning potentials, which critically depended on their
complex social histories, or their bare physical appearance
that did not - to the same extend – depend on memories of
their creation.
In the meaning related task, participants would first see a
prompt (1.5 sec) indicating that they would be subjected to a
meaning related task. Thereafter they would see one of the
six target concepts (‘responsibility’, ‘safety’ etc.) written on
the screen (2 sec) followed by an image of a LEGO models
depicting this target concept (shown for 3 sec). Then they
would be prompted to rate the model on a 6-point scale from
“not well” to “very well” in response to the question “How
well do you think this model represents the concept X?”
In the physical property related task, participants would
first be prompted that they would be subjected to a physical
property task (1.5 sec). Then they would be presented with
an image of one of the LEGO models from one of the four
conditions (3 sec). After this they were prompted to rate the
model on a 6 point scale from “fragile” to “robust” in
response to the question “How fragile/robust do you find
this model?”.
In both types of rating tasks, participants performed their
rating by moving a cursor to the desired place on the rating

2447

scale by tapping a response box button with the right hand
index finger and then submit the decision using the righthand middle finger. Participants were instructed to complete
their rating within 5 sec after which a time-out would occur
and the procedure would proceed to the next trial.

fMRI acquisition parameters and analysis
We used a 3T Siemens TIM Trio MRI system with a 12
channel head coil to acquire the T2* weighted gradient
echo, echo-planar images (EPI) with Blood Oxygenation
Level-Dependent (BOLD) contrast using the following
parameters: echo time (TE): 30 ms, repetition time (TR):
3000 ms, and a flip angle of 90°. Whole-brain images were
obtained over fifty-six sequential, interleaved 2.5 mm axial
slices with a 3 x 3 mm resolution and a field of view of 192
x 192 mm.
All fMRI data analyses were conducted using SPM8
(Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of
Imaging Neuroscience, London) implemented in MATLAB
using default settings unless otherwise specified. Images
were spatially realigned, normalized to the MNI template
and smoothed with an isotropic 8mm FWHM Gaussian
kernel. Statistical analysis was conducted following a twolevel general linear model approach (Penny & Holmes,
2007). On the first-level, single participant task-related
BOLD responses were modeled for each subject by
convolving condition onsets and durations with the standard
hemodynamic response function and effects for each
condition were estimated using a general linear model
approach. The main contrast concerned perception of the
LEGO models in the meaning-related versus the physical
property-related task. Then, for the meaning related task,
main and interaction effects of the four conditions were
modeled. Besides the analysis included standard regressors
for the six SPM8 motion parameters and a high-pass filter
set to 128 s cut off. Contrast images from the first-level
analysis went into a second-level RFX group analysis using
the one-sample t-tests in SPM8. The significance threshold
for all main effects was set to p < .05, FDR corrected for
multiple comparisons, while selected interaction effects
were explored also at uncorrected thresholds. Functional
images were overlaid with the standard SPM8 single subject
high resolution T1 image.

Results
Contrasting the ‘meaning’ > ‘physical property’ related task
yielded patterns of activation in a bilateral network of brain
areas comprising mainly the dorso-medial PFC, TPJ, and
inferior frontal gyrus (see table 1A for peak voxels and stats
and fig. 1A). The opposite contrast, ‘physical property’ >
‘meaning’ related task, yielded activations in the right
precentral gyrus, the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, and the
primary occipital cortex bilaterally (table 1B and fig. 1B).
The four factorial conditions were tested separately for the
two tasks.

For the meaning related task, the contrast ‘participation’ >
‘no participation’ activated the right medial prefrontal and
anterior cingulate cortex, left TPJ and precuneus (see table

2448

1C and fig. 1C). The opposite contrast, ‘no participation >
participation’ and both main effects of collective/individual
did not yield above threshold results, however the
interaction ‘participation’ > ‘no participation’ * ‘collective’
> ‘individual’ activated a network comprising left anterior
cingulate cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus and L insula
(see table 1D and fig. 1D). No other contrasts were found to
be significant.

Discussion
We found differential patterns of brain activation when
participants were primed to perceive LEGO models as
physical constructs (rating their fragility) and when they
approached them as vehicles of socially constituted
meaning. Rating the relative fragility of a model calls
attention to the physical surface properties of the structure
and might imply imagining to haptically manipulate it in
order to make judgments. This activity was found to activate
the fusiform gyrus bilaterally and areas of right pre-central
gyrus were activated. Both sites have previously been found
related to perception of physical objects (Shmuelof &
Zohary, 2005). While the fusiform gyrus is mostly
associated with object recognition and categorization (Bar et
al., 2001; Chao, Haxby, & Martin, 1999; Gauthier, Tarr,
Anderson, Skudlarski, & Gore, 1999; Grill-Spector, 2003),
motor areas seem particularly sensitive to mental object
manipulation (Vanrie, Beatse, Wagemans, Sunaert, & Van
Hecke, 2002).
In contrast, rating the expressive qualities of the models
requires participants to pay special attention to the meaning
potentials of the models, which might imply 1) recalling the
particular social practices in which these meanings evolved,
and 2) reading the models as communicative symbols (not
unlike gestures, figurative signs or even words). This task
was found to activate a bilateral network of areas
comprising dorso-medial prefrontal cortex, TPJ and IFG
was activated. The mPFC and TPJ are consistently found in
studies of social cognition and interaction, and generally
associated with mentalizing, agency, and ascription of
intentionality (Amodio & Frith, 2006; Frith & Frith, 2006;
Iacoboni et al., 2004; Van Overwalle, 2009). Interestingly,
previous studies have claimed this area to only activate
when participants made judgments about other people and
not objects (Mitchell et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 2005). We
suggest that the activation of mPFC and TPJ reflects how
meaning related rating task actualizes the particular social
history constituting the meaning dimension of the stimulus
LEGO models (Mano et al., 2011; Schaefer & Rotte, 2010).
We also found activations of the IFG bilaterally. IFG,
particularly in the left hemisphere, is traditionally
considered a “language area” and consistently shows up in
studies on verbal semantics (A. J. Newman, Pancheva,
Ozawa, Neville, & Ullman, 2001; S. D. Newman, Just,
Keller, Roth, & Carpenter, 2003; Rodd, Davis, & Johnsrude,
2005). However, recent studies suggest generalizing the
function of these areas to semantic aspects of other
modalities of communication and expressivity as well. For

instance, the IFG has been found in studies of hand gestures
(Dick, Goldin-Meadow, Hasson, Skipper, & Small, 2009;
Xu, Gannon, Emmorey, Smith, & Braun, 2009), facial
expressions (Jabbi & Keysers, 2008), music (Vuust et al.,
2005), as well as studies on symbolic objects (Tylén et al.,
2009). It is often noticed that in case of non-verbal (or
complex verbal) stimuli, bilateral activation patterns are
more prevalent, suggesting higher processing demands due
to differential levels of complexity, conventionalization or
expertise (Tylén et al., 2009; Vuust et al., 2005; Yang,
Edens, Simpson, & Krawczyk, 2009). We suggest that the
activation of IFG in this experiment is related to the way
participants explore the LEGO models as communicative
signs not unlike verbal or gestural signals (Tylén, Bjørndahl,
& Weed, 2011).
Within the meaning-related condition, we found a strong
main effect of participation - that is - watching models that
the participant had constructed herself individually or with
her group in contrast to models built by other
individuals/groups. Making assessments of your own
(known), collective and individual models could be
expected to depend more on episodic memory traces: the
participant’s judgments of the meaning related properties of
the models rely in part on personal recollections of the
preceding building activities and discussions and perhaps to
a lesser extent on semantic memory and processing.
Accordingly, this contrast yielded activation in social
cognition areas such as mPFC, anterior cingulate and left
TPJ. This seems to replicate findings from previous studies
investigating the contrast between self-generated and other
generated texts (Mano et al., 2011). Interestingly, we do not
find the meaning-related pattern of IFG activation in this
contrast, which suggests that IFG is involved in more
general explorations of meaning across own and others’
models. However, we observed additional activations of left
precuneus, an area consistently found in studies of
autobiographical memory and experience of agency
(Cavanna, 2006; Maddock, Garrett, & Buonocore, 2001).
Lastly, we found an interaction effect between our main
factors: When participants made assessments of their own
models from the collective condition (in contrast to
other’s/individual), we found activation in the anterior
cingulate, the right IFG and the left insula. The insula is
interesting in this respect as it is often associated with social
emotions (Phan, Wager, Taylor, & Liberzon, 2002) and
empathy (Singer, 2006; Singer & Lamm, 2009).
Furthermore, it has been suggested that the insula forms a
network with the anterior cingulate cortex sensitive to the
saliency of stimuli and events (Menon & Uddin, 2010). It
seems likely that the more arousing character of collective
building activities (in contrast to individual building
activities) make these models more salient to the participant
and thus evoke stronger insula and anterior cingulate
activations.

Conclusions
In this study we investigated the neurocognitive status of
symbolic artifacts. Together our findings support the idea
that symbolic artifacts are simultaneously physical objects
and vehicles for non-tangible social meanings. Very
different neurocognitive processes are involved in attending
to physical features and social meanings, and in the latter
case they are modulated by a history of social engagement
of the object. Symbolic artifacts can thus be conceived as
material and neuro-cognitive trails of social interactions and
cultural meanings.
