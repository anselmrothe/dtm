Abstract
This paper analyzes probability judgments about properties
that can take multiple values (i.e., monadic polytomous
events). It extends previous work on pattern-based deviations
from standard (extensional) probabilities. Pattern-probabilities
are formalized in Bayesian Logic (BL) and should be
applicable when testing the overall adequacy of alternative
logical hypotheses while allowing for exceptions. BL
systematically predicts ‘conjunction fallacies’ (CFs) and,
more generally, ‘inclusion fallacies’ (IFs), when a subset is
deemed more probable than its superset. BL formalizes a fit
between data and explanatory noisy-logical patterns and was
supported in previous experiments on dyadic logical
connectives with two dichotomous events. Here BL is
extended to monadic prediction with several subclasses. BL
may for instance predict Ppattern(A) > Ppattern(non-A) even
though f(A) < f(non-A), given that non-A has more subclasses
than A. Two experiments using material from the Linda
paradigm corroborate a pattern approach and rule out
confirmation as an alternative explanation.

We cannot dispense with the idea of the rationality or irrationality of judgments, even though defining their rationality
may often be difficult. The most established and important
norms of rationality are presumably basic norms of formal
logics and probability theory. As early as over 2000 years
ago, Aristotle’s Organon provided a systematization of logics and also, albeit less refined, of inductive belief. The history of philosophy and mathematics in recent centuries led
to canonical formulations of formal logics (Frege, Russell,
Whitehead, Wittgenstein) and probability theory (e.g., Kolmogorov). Although modifications and more specialized systems continue to be developed in philosophy, mathematics
and computer science (e.g., modal logics, multivalued logics, non-monotonic logics, belief functions), psychology
continues to focus almost exclusively on these basic norms.
Their domain-general application molded Kahneman and
Tversky’s heuristic-and-bias approach, taking these norms
as given and concluding that homo sapiens sapiens is ultimately irrational, even with regard to most basic laws of
rationality (cf. Fiedler & von Sydow, 2005, evaluation of
this fertile research program).
Kahneman and Tversky studied for instance a scenario
wherein Linda, L, is described by a story in a way that
seems suggestive of her being a feminist. Participants were
then asked whether P(L is a bank teller) or P(L is a bank
teller and a feminist) is higher (Kahneman & Tversky,
1982). Most participants judged P(B) < P(B & F), thus committing a conjunction fallacy (CF), since the (standard) pro-

bability of a logical conjunction can never be higher than of
one of its conjuncts.—This bias-and-heuristic approach has
been criticized, fiercely but eloquently, by Gigerenzer
(1996). He criticized not only the alternative heuristics (in
the above example, ‘representativeness’) as “one-word
theories” almost void of any explanatory value, but also the
“content-blind” application of “narrow norms” without
accounting for their ecological context. Although my
approach clearly differs from Gigerenzer’s explanation of
the CF (von Sydow, 2011), I think he is right in stressing
that rational norms are essentially contextual. However, I
agree with Kahneman (1996) that criticizing ‘narrow norms’
risks the danger of normative agnosticism.
This paper addresses the extensionality inherent in standard norms of logics and probability theory, by investigating
probability judgments about several mutually exclusive
classes. Standard probability is extensional since the probability of a monadic hypothesis (X are A) is defined by the
relative frequency of confirmatory elements (its extension)
relative to all elements in a universe of discourse. Extensionality does not consider the number of subclasses (an
essential aspect of intension), but rather the number of
observed cases in a class. We here apply Bayesian Logic
(von Sydow, 2011) to monadic predicates based on several
explicitly represented subclasses, where the intension of the
class matters. It also builds on the renaissance of Bayesian
approaches in cognitive science (Oaksford & Chater, 2007).
It also builds on the idea of strong sampling (Tenenbaum &
Griffiths, 2001; cf. Navarro, Dry, & Lee, 2012), but BL can
even assign higher probabilities to more specific hypotheses
if there are known exceptions (von Sydow, 2011).
In philosophy the Lockean Thesis refers to the controversial idea that one can assign probabilities to logical propositions (Foley, 2009). The non-standard approach of BL may
allow for rescuing common sense assumptions and a kind of
Lockean Thesis—perhaps better called ‘Bayesian thesis’
here.

Truth Table Logics and Probability Theory
– Two Narrow Norms for Predication?
Problem of sample size Given one has no prior knowledge
about a group of animals, X, and has either observed one or
one hundred confirming cases to be black, B, standard logics
does not distinguish between these situations, and even
relative frequencies assign a probability of 1 in either case.
However, the use of probabilities about probabilities seems
more reasonable.
Problem of exceptions We believe “ravens are black”,
even though we know that white ravens do exist. Should
exceptions falsify nearly all our general predications? To

2511

use standard probability instead of logics seems to resolve
this problem, since the probability P(B|X) remains high.
Problem of inclusion However, even if we have
observed Xs being B a hundred times, and only a single case
‘X is non-B’, P(B|X) would remain smaller than P(B ∨ nonB|X). Taking probability as the criterion for adequate predication would in uncertain situations still force us always to
prefer tautologies (such as “Ravens are black or not black”)
over any other, more informative hypotheses.
Hence, if an adequacy criterion of predication should
describe the real contingent patterns found in the world,
neither standard logics nor probability could serve as a
suitable adequacy criterion (von Sydow, 2011).

A) even if f(A) < f(non-A). Such findings exclude many but
not all alternative models (Tentori et al., 2013; cf. von
Sydow, 2011, Exp. 2).
Monadic BL with several subclasses Subsequently BL
is formalized for monadic predication with c qualitatvive
subclasses. However, we will focus on c = 5: A, B, C, D, E
(cf. the experiments for examples). Hypothesis ‘Xs are A’
[A] is thus nested in the hypotheses ‘Xs are A or B’ [AB],
and in AC, or ABC. Therefore, standard (extensional) probabilities require PE(A) ≤ PE(AB) ≤ PE(ABC) ≤ PE(ABCD).
Step 0 only describes the input which should then be
compared to the ideal patterns specified in Steps 1 and 2.
BL may take frequencies as well as beliefs (about extensional probabilities of cells) as input. BL assumes a

Step 3 calculates the likelihood of the data δ given the
ideal explanatory hypotheses. δ, in our polytomous monadic
case, consists of a vector of length c, δ1,…,δc, (cf. Step 0).
For a particular probability table PT (Step 2, 3) referring to
a hypothesis j and a noise level i, we calculate the likelihood
using the multinomial distribution. In our example (c = 5):
𝑛
𝑃�𝛿�𝑃𝑃𝑖,𝑗 � = �𝛿 𝛿 𝛿 𝛿 𝛿 � 𝑝1 𝛿1 𝑝2 𝛿2 𝑝3 𝛿3 𝑝4 𝛿4 𝑝5 𝛿5
1 2 3 4 5

Method

In Step 4, Bayes’ theorem is used to turn the likelihoods
into posterior probabilities:
𝑃�𝑃𝑃𝑖,𝑗 �𝛿� =

𝑃�𝛿�𝑃𝑃𝑖,𝑗 �𝑃(𝑃𝑃𝑖,𝑗 )
𝑃(𝛿)

Here P(PT) represents the prior for a PT (in line with the
subjective frequencies defining our subjective belief distribution; cf. Step 0). P(δ) is a normalizing constant (calculated by summing up all likelihoods weighted by their priors).
In Step 5, the probability of a particular hypothesis i is
determined by summing up over the PTs with its different
noise levels j. (Here no further steps or weightings are
needed; cf. von Sydow 2011.) The one-dimensional patternprobabilities differ considerably from standard extensional
probabilities and from other measures suggested to model
IFs. In the following, we start investigating monadic polytomous BL and the predicted class of IFs empirically.

Experiments 1 and 2
Here I report only considerable parts of two simple experiments concerning probability judgments single polytomous
attribute dimensions. (monadic predication).
The experiments investigate (monadic) inclusion fallacies
(IFs) since the hypotheses are partially nested. The classes
in this dimension, A, B, C, D, E, are framed as mutually
exclusive, and one prediction of BL is that people judge
P(A) > P(non-A) with P(non-A) = P(B) + P(C) + P(D) +
P(E) even if f(A) < f(non-A). The predictions for pattern
probabilities, PP, clearly differ from those based on standard
extensional probabilities (relative frequencies), PE.
The predictions of BL also differ, for instance, from a
confirmation account of IFs that assumes that people
misinterpret probability as confirmation, which should result
in selecting the most strongly confirmed hypothesis when
asked for the most probable one (cf. von Sydow, 2011).
Although we focus on monadic IFs, we use attributes
reminiscent of the original Linda task: In Experiment 1 we
are concerned with job descriptions, in Experiment 2 with
political attitudes. Additionally, in Experiment 1 we use
either ordinary language “OR” or “AND” to sum several
subclasses. Although the latter seems logically incorrect, we
predicted that in a context of mutually exclusive events the
meaning of these ‘connectives’ would not differ. Furthermore, in both experiments the order of labels of the classes
was counterbalanced to control for content effects. Finally,
in Phase 1 we investigated single samples of data and in
Phase 2 a timed series of three samples to test for
contrasting predictions of priors vs. confirmation.

Materials and procedures Both experiments concern
thirteen alternative statements about the graduates of
different schools (Linda school, Humboldt school, Goethe
school etc.). The experiments were run on a computer.
On the introduction pages, participants were told that they
would receive sample information about the distribution of
graduates, and they were given two examples for sample
distributions. In Experiment 1, the attribute-dimension concerned five classes of graduates’ main jobs (A translator, B
bank employee, C artist, D teacher, E physician). Experiment 2 concerned five classes of main political attitude (A
conservative, B social, C liberal, D ecological, E feminist),
explicitly framed as alternative outcomes of a test that
assigns people to one political group only. With regard to
procedure and samples the experiments were identical.
In Phase 1, fifteen schools with counterbalanced names
were shown in random order. For each school they saw one
sample of graduates: a table with category names and
frequencies (numbers) showed which jobs the sample had
chosen. Apart from the category order A, B, C, D, E, a
second condition involved the label orders E, D, B, A, C
(experimental factor 1 in both Experiments) to control for
content effects/prior knowledge: Ecological analysis suggested that if exogenous prior probabilities were considered,
D and E should subjectively be expected the most probable.
Likewise for Phase 1 and the first label order summing up
all samples involved PE(A) = 13%, PE(B) = 24%, PE(C) =
10%, PE(D) = 27%, PE(E) = 25% (since the frequencies are
kept constant in the second condition, other labels had
high/low values). BL should only be weakly influenced by
such priors, since a strong transfer between different schools
seems implausible, particularly if the present samples are
large enough that it is clear they come from different
populations. However, a confirmation approach may rely on
these differences (cf. also Phase 2).
Participants were asked: “Which statement appears most
probably to be valid to you? [...] Answer intuitively.” The
experiments concerned: “Pupils of this school…”. In Experiment 1, the hypotheses concerned whether the pupils of
the school become for example “S1 translators”, or “S8
translators, bank tellers, artists or teachers”. Note that S1
refers to a subset of S8. In Experiment 2, hypotheses
likewise concerned nested attributes such as: “S1 …conservative” or “S8 …conservative, social, liberal or feminist”.
In addition to the logically correct OR-formulations, Experiment 1 used AND-formulations (experimental factor 2):
“S8 translators, bank tellers, artists and teachers”. If AND
were here interpreted as logical conjunction, the intersection
would be empty, but for alternative classes AND was
expected to be used for adding as well. 1
Apart from the logical formulations and the varied labels,
the thirteen hypotheses in both experiments referred to the

Experiment 2 did not pursue this issue, since the AND-interpretation as
logical conjunction may become more plausible due to a non-exclusive
interpretation of classes such as “conservative” and “feminist”.

same classes; as shown in Figure 2 in Phase 1 this is: S1 A;
S2 B; S3 C; S4 D; S5 E; S6 AC; S7 ADE; S8 ABCD; S9
BC; S10 BE; S11 BDE; S12 BCDE; S13 DE.
Phase 2 of the experiments concerned ten further schools
in random order. Participants now for each school were
successively provided with samples from three surveys of
differing dates, one twenty years earlier, another ten, and
then with a recent survey. It was mentioned that the surveys
might differ in size. Participants should select the hypothesis
that appeared most probably valid with regard to the present
school. The hypotheses in Phase 2 (cf. Figure 2, Panel 2, cf.
the abscissa of the graphs), apart from the label and the
formulation factor, did not differ in the experiments.
Participants In Experiments 1 and 2, 57 and 36 participants from the University of Heidelberg took part voluntarily, in exchange for course credits or money (8 Euros per
hour). They were assigned randomly to the four conditions
of Experiment 1 and the two conditions of Experiment 2.

Results
Figure 2 shows the proportion of selected hypotheses judged
to be most probable in the six selected schools S investigated in Phase 1 (with a single sample per school), and the
six selected schools in Phase 2 (three successive samples).
We selected most informative examples (including the cases
with most deviation between the two experiments: S3, S5).
For simplicity, we conflate over the experimental conditions
of label order and formulation type. But out of the 25 data
patterns in overall six conditions (hence 150 charts), the
main prediction of BL deviated from the predicted modal
selection in two cases only. As predicted, it does not seem to
matter whether the addition of classes was expressed by an
OR or an AND in ordinary language. The high fit of the predictions of BL, however, suggests that people understood
the relationship between language and logical meaning.
Conflated over conditions, the modal selection in all 25
schools (both phases) corresponded to the hypothesis
predicted by BL. The mean correlation in the schools between selections and deterministic prediction were: Exp. 1,
.98; Exp. 2, .96. In all schools, S, (both Experiments) the
same modal values resulted—despite different content.
Subsequently we discuss results for the example schools
in Phase 1 and in Phase 2. In school S1, PE(A) is less extensionally probable than its negation PE(B)+PE(C)+PE(D)
+PE(E). Nevertheless the vast majority of participants, in
line with BL, judged hypothesis A to be more probable than
hypothesis ‘BCDE’ (with PP(A) < PP(BCDE)). This involves
systematic inclusion fallacies (IFs) predicted by BL (since
the hypotheses AC, ABE, ABCD have higher extensional
probabilities). The difference between the experiments or
corresponding two label conditions seemed week. Additionally, for another school—not reported here—a exactly
reverse order of frequencies led to highly analogous results.
S2 excludes that people always select the modal answer
(B), since people, as predicted by BL, mostly selected the
BDE hypothesis. For a confirmation account, prior cell
beliefs should have led to more varying selections in the two

label order conditions. Likewise, confirmation cannot explain the results if one assumes flat prior beliefs, since it
would be highest for the modal-frequency hypothesis (B).
S3 corroborates that people select the inclusive BCDE
hypothesis if predicted, although confirmation (for flat
priors) would predict selection of E instead of BCDE.
S4 excludes a possible simpler approximation of pattern
probabilities by a ‘ratio heuristic’. The break-point between
attributed and non-attributed classes might have been the
largest ratio between classes. However, despite 6/1 > 29/6,
the results corroborate the prediction of PP(DE) > PP(BDE).
S5 investigates a situation in which BL’s prediction DE is
less clear (see the second, minor prediction D). Participants
in Exp. 2 (political attitude) selected more frequently the
more specific hypothesis (D) over the main prediction (DE)
– perhaps due to chance, or to greater noise-tolerance in the
political scenario (cf. S3, S11), which could be accounted
for within BL.—S6 led to the predicted dominant inclusive
selection ADE, not to the hypothesis referring to the modal
frequency A. However, in at least one of the labeling
conditions, A may have had lower prior expectations and
hence a higher confirmation than classes D or E (and hence
than the overall hypothesis ADE). Even if again we alternatively assume flat priors for the five classes, the standard
extensional conceptualization of confirmation predicts the
selection of the most specific hypothesis, here A.
Panel 2 of Figure 2 shows the results for Phase 2 and
which hypotheses are thought to hold most probable for a
present school (t3), after showing two previous samples
from earlier years (t1, t2). Although it is not clear to what
extent previous data should be used for the judgment about
t3, an inductive transfer parameter may rationally model the
degree to which old data should be used in new situations.
However, the directions of prior effects are clear and they
can be contrasted with predictions of confirmation. For BL
the influence of a prior should be mainly effective if one has
small data samples in t3, otherwise the data may suggest
that earlier samples come from different populations and
should be ignored.—In S7 and S8 the small sample in t3
according to BL does not favor DE very strongly over
hypothesis E. As predicted, the selections (in both
Experiments) varied in line with the t1 and t2 priors,
favoring either E (S7) or DE (S8). In contrast the
confirmation of D (as part of DE) in S8 is actually negative;
thus no measure of confirmation (difference, ratio, etc.)
would predict that D should be involved in the preferred
hypothesis.—Similarly, in S9 and S10 the frequency in t3
was identical; however, the selection of hypotheses was in
line with priors and BL but not with a confirmation
approach. In S9, the mostly selected B answer is not
confirmed but actually disconfirmed in t3 (relative to t1 and
t2) (67% relative to 79%), whereas A and C were confirmed.
In contrast, in S10, with most ADE selections, B is actually
confirmed and A and C disconfirmed. Thus confirmation
seems unable to account for the data.—S11 corroborates that
the most participants change hypotheses if a new pattern in
t3 is clearly predicted (here E). However, some selected the

DE hypothesis, thus putting stronger emphasis on the prior
than expected. This is even more at odds with confirmation,
since D was disconfirmatory.—Finally, S12 corroborates the
predicted hypothesis of BL (BDE), whereas classes D and E
were actually disconfirmatory.

General Discussion
Overall, the results obtained in these first frequency-based
experiments on monadic polytomous BL strongly corroborate BL’s predictions. People commit inclusion fallacies
even within one dimension with many subclasses. We found
only few or minor differences between (a) label conditions,
(b) AND vs. OR formulations, and (c) the experiments with
different content. The differences between the two experiments—if not entirely due to chance—may be explained by
differences in noise-tolerance, which can be modelled
within BL. The results strongly support a pattern-approach
of IFs and could not differ more clearly from extensional
probability. Here non-A involved several subclasses and
people judged P(A) > P(non-A) even if f(A) > f(non-A) was
the case (dissociation with frequencies).
To my knowledge, the present results cannot be explained
by any of the many alternative accounts of conjunction fallacy (see von Sydow, 2011; von Sydow & Fiedler, 2013).
Tentori et al. (2011) correctly note that most approaches of
CFs cannot account for a dissociation with frequencies. Although a confirmation approach may do so, it cannot
account for our results: in Phase 1, there was no ‘inverse’
influence of prior beliefs, as predicted by confirmation. If
one alternatively assumes flat priors, since each situation is
evaluated anew (as we assume), confirmation in contrast to
the results would always predict the selection of very
specific hypotheses (with modal frequencies). Moreover,
Phase 2 explicitly addressed priors, by varying previous
information about the schools. Although people as predicted
preferred using newer evidence, they were influenced by the
priors if the new evidence did not clearly show that one is
concerned with a population that differs from the old one.
Crucially, the effect of priors went in the direction predicted
by our Bayesian pattern approach, not in the opposed direction of a confirmation approach. Although these results
may shed light on previous findings (apparently favouring
confirmation; Tentori et al., 2013), a disconfirmation of a
confirmation account does not imply its falsification. Confirmation may nonetheless play a role to explain one class of
CFs (even if one distinguishes it from pseudo-confirmation
effects, such as scale construction effects, or relevance
effects). Generally, inclusion fallacies presumably have
several different causes, including misunderstanding of
terms (Hertwig, Benz, & Kraus, 2008; von Sydow, 2014),
unclear sets (Sloman, Over, Slovak, & Stibel, 2003), confusing confirmation with probability (Lagnado & Shanks,
2003; Tentori et al., 2013), or using pattern probabilities
where CFs cease to be fallacies (von Sydow, 2001, 2014).
Confirmation of patterns may even play a role.
The present results, in any case, corroborate a patternprobability account. The findings nonetheless suggest that

standard dichotomous BL (von Sydow, 2001) only applies if
one is concerned with two classes and dichotomous events.
The results suggest that a proper formalization of patternprobabilities depends on the subjective representation of
classes—the intension—, not only on the extension. If one is
concerned with stories, as in the original Linda scenario,
such representations may vary in an uncontrolled way.
Formalizations of BL (and of heuristic approximations of
pattern probabilities) should take subjective representations
into account (for another aspect, see von Sydow, 2014).
In conclusion, the present research corroborates BL in a
new domain. It reveals new avenues of research and
suggests that the role of representation in probability
judgments is richer than previously assumed. Subsequent
research is crucial to address such issues in more detail.
