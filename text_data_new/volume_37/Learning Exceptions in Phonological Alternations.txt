example, in a back/round vowel harmony system in which
features are shared from the leftmost vowel rightwards,
words that begin with a back/round vowel (e.g., [o], [u])
must only contain back/round vowels, and words that begin
with a vowel that is front/unround (e.g., [i], [e]) must only
contain front/unround vowels. This creates alternations that
apply when a suffix is added to the stem (creating
morphophonological alternations). For example, in a
simplified analysis of Hungarian, the dative suffix has two
versions (allomorphs) depending on the back features of the
stem vowel. When the stem vowel is front, the suffix
surfaces as /nɛk/, as in [tsi:m-nɛk] ‘address-DAT’, and

Abstract
The present study explores learning phonological alternations
that contain exceptions. Participants were exposed to a
back/round vowel harmony pattern in which a regular suffix
followed harmony, varying between /e/ and /o/ depending on
the back/round phonetic features of the stem, and an
exceptional suffix that was always /o/ regardless of the
features of the stem vowel. Participants in Experiment 1
learned the behavior of both suffixes, but performance for the
non-alternating suffix was higher when the suffix happened to
adhere to vowel harmony. In Experiment 2, participants were
exposed only to the same suffixes as Experiment 1, but the
non-alternating suffix only appeared in harmonic contexts,
creating ambiguity between exceptionality and alternation.
Participants only correctly selected the non-alternating suffix
when it appeared in a harmonic context. This suggests that
learners are biased towards alternating harmony patterns, but
require concrete evidence of non-alternation to learn the nonalternating suffix.

when the stem vowel is back, the suffix surfaces as /-nɔk/,
as in [ɔblɔk-nɔk]‘window-DAT’ (Hayes & Londe, 2006;
Ringen, 1988; Vago, 1976).
Hungarian vowel harmony is complicated by its many
types of exceptions. Front unround vowels are considered
neutral, ‘transparent’ vowels because they fail to trigger
vowel harmony if there is a back vowel preceding the front
vowel (e.g., [radi:r-nɔk] ‘eraser-DAT’). In this case, there is
a principled way of knowing whether vowel harmony
should apply (the features of the front vowel). Despite the
principled nature of transparent vowels, there are several
cases in which the presence of a neutral transparent vowel in
a stem cannot be used to predict the feature of the suffix.
For example, while most stems containing neutral vowels
take a front vowel suffix (e.g., [tsi:m-nɛk] ‘address-DAT’),
there are some stems that take a back vowel suffix (e.g.,
[hi:d-nɔk],‘ bridge-DAT’). Determining whether a stem
will take a front vowel suffix or a back vowel suffix is
largely determined by statistical regularities of the
additional vowel features in the stem (such as height)
(Hayes & Londe, 2006). While these statistical regularities
are relatively accurate at predicting the vowel quality of the
suffix, they are general tendencies, rather than exceptionless
alternations. In addition, some stems appear to take both
front and back vowel suffixes, meaning that applying the
harmony pattern is optional in these cases. In optionality, a
phonological alternation may or may not apply. In these
cases, speakers will produce both a front vowel suffix and a
back vowel suffix for the same stem (e.g., both [ɔrze:n-

Introduction
One of the major challenges for characterizing the formal
properties of language is that the vast majority of patterns
are rife with exceptions. Exceptions not only pose a
challenge for generative linguistics, but potentially to a
language learner, who must distinguish between accidental
regularities and true patterns that contain exceptionality.
This paper focuses on phonological alternations, which
govern the patterns of sounds that make up individual
words. A phonological alternation occurs when an
underlying condition is met within the sounds of a word or
phrase that causes the sounds to change accordingly.
The vast majority of phonological alternations show some
kind of exceptionality (Coetzee & Pater, 2011). It is these
cases of exceptions that pose a challenge to the learner, as
the learner must sort out which instances follow the
alternation and which do not. Because the learner starts off
without any specific knowledge of the language, the learner
must make use of a combination of the data and any prior
biases for how languages must be structured in order to
determine how patterns apply, despite the many exceptions.
This paper focuses on vowel harmony, phonological
pattern in which adjacent vowels (ignoring consonants)
must share the same value of a phonological feature
(Clements, 1976). In vowel harmony, all vowels of a word
agree with each other in terms of a specific phonetically
based feature value, such as front/back or high/low. For

nɔk]/[ɔrze:n-nɛk] were found in Hayes and Londe’s 2006
web search). Finally, another form of exceptionality occurs
when some suffixes fail to alternate to vowel harmony,
despite having all of the phonological properties necessary
to alternate. While the dative sufffix in Hungarian
(discussed above) alternates in to adhere to vowel harmony,

698

there are some suffixes in Hungarian that fail to alternate,
such as the temporal suffix /-kor/ (e.g., [øtkor] ‘at five
(o’clock)’) (Kenesei, Vago, & Fenyvesi, 2002). In this type
of exceptionality, a form will fail to apply despite meeting
the conditions for alternation. In this case, there is only one
form of the suffix, rather than a suffix that alternates.
Because most phonological alternations show some aspect
of exceptionality such as those found in Hungarian,
understanding how exceptionality affects the learning
process is extremely important. While the bulk of research
on learning exceptionality has focused on morphological
processes (Prasada & Pinker, 1993), there has been an
increased interest in learnability of exceptionality in
phonological patterns (Baer-Henney, Kügler, & van de
Vijver, 2014; Coetzee, 2009). For example, Baer-Henney et
al. (2014) found that learners were more likely to generalize
a phonetically grounded vowel harmony pattern compared
to a phonetically ungrounded disharmony pattern when the
grounded pattern occurred in only 65% of the items. This
suggests that learners have a bias towards harmony over
disharmony, even when the input is maximally ambiguous
between harmony and disharmony.
Unlike Baer-Henney et al. (2014), the present paper
focuses on exceptions in phonological alternations in which
a particular suffix fails to alternate in accordance with the
phonological pattern in question. There are several reasons
to focus on learning a language with both alternating and
non-alternating morphemes. First, the morphologically
based exceptions to phonological alternations are fairly
common among languages, and can be replicated within an
artificial grammar learning paradigm with relative ease.
Second, several formal linguistic studies have explored the
topic of non-alternating exceptions, providing important
theoretical and bases for an experimental learning study
(Zonnefeld, 1978), specifically in vowel harmony (Finley,
2010).
Previous research on learnability of exceptional nonalternating forms has revealed a bias towards nonalternation over alternation, even when alternations occurred
in 75% of the training data (Coetzee, 2009; Stave, Smolek,
& Kapatsinski, 2013; White, 2014). However, it is possible
that the bias towards non-alternation in Coetzee’s (2009)
paper stems from a bias against alternations in stems
(Beckman, 1998), rather a general non-alternation bias, as
stimuli in this Coetzee’s study only involved stem
alternations. Baer-Henney et al.’s (2014) study suggested a
bias towards vowel harmony, which is largely driven by
alternations. However, because Baer-Henney et al.’s (2014)
were focused on naturalness, it is unclear if naturalness was
the drove the bias towards harmony. The present study will
help tease apart how learners respond to non-alternating
affixes.
Previous research has shown that adult participants can
learn a back/round vowel harmony pattern with relatively
minimal exposure to the pattern (e.g., as pairs of words,
[bodo-bodomu], [bede-bedemi], etc.) (Finley & Badecker,
2009). The present experiment extends these findings by

including both an alternating and a non-alternating suffix. In
Experiment 1, learners were exposed to a stem+suffix
pattern where one suffix alternated according to vowel
harmony, while a second stem failed to alternate. In
Experiment 2, participants were exposed to the same
alternating and non-alternating suffixes, but were only
shown the non-alternating suffix in a context consistent with
vowel harmony. If participants show a bias towards nonalternation, participants should be able to learn the behavior
of the non-alternating suffixes in both experiments, but if
participants are biased towards harmony over disharmony,
then participants should fail to learn the non-alternating
suffix without direct exposure.

Experiment 1
In the present study, learners were trained on a novel vowel
harmony pattern in which one suffix alternated between
[-me] and [-mo] depending on the back/round features of the
stem, and another suffix was [-go] regardless of the features
of the stem.

Participants
All 26 participants were adults who were fluent English
speakers recruited from the psychology subject pool at
Pacific Lutheran University, a small liberal arts college in
Western Washington, USA. No participant had any previous
experience with a vowel harmony system, natural or
artificial.

Design
Participants were exposed to a back/round vowel harmony
pattern that was presented in a set of three words: stem,
stem+suffix1 and stem+suffix2 (e.g., [kine, kinego,
kineme]). For half of the participants, suffix1 was the
alternating [-me/-mo] suffix, while the other half of
participants heard the non-alternating [-go] suffix as suffix1.
In the alternating ([-me/-mo]) suffix items, stems triggered a
suffix vowel that was either /e/ or /o/ depending on whether
the vowels in the stems contained front vowels (/i/ or /e/) or
back vowels (/o/ or /u/). In the case of the non-alternating
suffix ([-go]), the suffix vowel was always /o/ regardless of
whether the stem vowels were front or back. All stems were
of the form CVCV (e.g., [keti]) with the vowels following
back/round harmony constraints (all stem vowels were
either both front or both back, and never disharmonic), and
the consonants drawn from the set (/p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n/).
There were 24 triads: stem followed by stem+suffix1
followed by stem+suffix2. These 24 sets of items were
presented eight times, each in a random order. Examples of
the exposure stimuli can be found in Table 1.
Following exposure, participants were presented with a
two-alternative, forced-choice test in which participants
were asked to decide which was more likely to come from
the language they had just heard. Participants heard two
words, each identical except for the final vowel ending:
either /e/ or /o/. Because the first two vowels obeyed
harmony, the choice of the final vowel (/e/ or /o/) depended

on the back/round features of the vowels in the first two
syllables. The test items were presented in a random order,
with five test conditions, and 10 items for each condition.
Old items were items that were heard in the training set, and
contained a mixture of both [-go] and [-me/-mo] suffixes.
New-go, and New-me/mo items contained stems not heard
in the training set, but with the [-go] and [-me/-mo] suffixes,
respectively.

of the experiment were run in Psyscope X (Cohen,
MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993). Participants were
given both written and verbal instructions. The entire
experiment took approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Finally, there were Agglutinative test items in which the
alternating ([-me/-mo]) suffix was affixed to a word
containing a /stem-go/ word (e.g., [bidi-go-me] vs. [bidigo-mo]). These items were designed to test whether learners
based the harmony pattern on the vowel features of stem or
on the vowel features of the preceding suffix. For example,
if the learner chooses [bidi-go-me] over [bidi-go-mo], the
learner has based harmony on the stem rather than the
preceding suffix. On the other hand, if the learner chooses
[bidi-go-mo] over [bidi-go-me], then the learner is basing
harmony on the closest vowel to the suffix. Crosslinguistically, vowel harmony languages with exceptions
tend to follow locality principles and choose the closest
vowel as a source for harmony, rather than the stem, if the
stem is disharmonic with the closest vowel (Finley, 2010).
For example, in Turkish, the suffix [-gen] does not alternate
with back/round vowel harmony, but suffixes that follow
the [-gen] suffix agree with the non-alternating suffix, rather
than the stem (e.g., [tʃok-gen-ler], *[tʃok-gen-lar]
‘polygons’). In Finley’s (2010) survey of non-alternating
affixes in vowel harmony, no languages followed the nonlocal pattern. Thus, it is predicted that learners will be
likely to follow the cross-linguistic locality principles in the
Agglutinative test items. Examples of these test items can be
found in Table 2; note that the correct item was always [-go]
regardless of the harmonic context.
All stimuli were recorded by a male speaker of American
English with some phonetics training in a sound attenuated
booth at 12,000 Hz. Stress was placed on the first syllable
using English pronunciation, with the exception that no
vowels were reduced, meaning that some English syllables
contained partial stress (as English reduces unstressed
syllables). All stimuli items were normalized for intensity
(set at 70dB), though participants were allowed to adjust

Results
Proportion of correct responses for all test items are given in
Figure 1. We compared each test item to 50% chance via
three separate one-sample t-tests. If participants learned the
harmony pattern with the correct suffix alternations
([-me/-mo] following harmony and [-go] as nonalternating), learners should select the correct response
significantly greater than chance. Participants were
successful at selecting the correct response for Old items
(mean = 0.77, SD = 0.20), t(25) = 6.92, p < 0.001, New-go
items (mean = 0.76, SD = 0.21), t(25) = 6.51, p < 0.001, and
New-me-mo items (mean = 0.68, SD = 0.24), t (25) = 3.88,
p = 0.001, but not to Old Agglutinative items (mean = 0.43,
SD = 0.26), t(25) = -1.42, p = 0.17 or New Agglutinative
Items (mean = 0.42, SD = 0.29), t(25) = -1.48, p = 0.15.
This suggests that learners were able to correctly identify
when to follow the harmony pattern (with the [-me/-mo]
suffix alternation) and when not to follow the harmony
pattern (with the [-go] suffix), but that they did not show a
bias towards the items that contained both the alternating
and non-alternating suffixes.
It is possible that even though learners successfully
selected the [-go] suffix at a rate higher than chance for
New-go items, that this success was based on the stems
containing a back vowel, which would obey harmony. If
this were the case, then participants may not have learned
the exceptionality of [-go], but simply applied regular vowel
harmony to this suffix. To test this, we separated the
responses to New-go items for front vowel stems and back

artificial, nor did they participate in Experiment 1.

Design
The design of Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1
with the following changes. The non-alternating [-go] suffix
only appeared in harmonic (back vowel stem) contexts,
which was achieved by eliminating all front vowel stem-go
suffixed items from the stimuli. Because front vowel
stem-go items were removed, it was no longer possible to
present the items as a triad. Instead, all items were presented
in pairs with the stem followed by the stem+suffix.
There were four different types of test items in
Experiment 2. New-go, New-me/mo and New Agglutinative
items were all identical to those found in Experiment 1. Oldgo items tested whether learners inferred that the front
vowel stems heard in training would take the disharmonic,
non-alternating affix [-go]. These included several of the
same items in Experiment 1 (e.g., *bemege vs. bemego).

If participants learned the harmony pattern with the

Participants were not successful at inferring the nonalternating status of [-go] in front vowel stem items, as Oldgo items (mean = 0.51 SD = 0.31), t(12) = 0.089, p = 0.93,
were not significantly greater than chance. New-go items
(mean = 0.58, SD = 0.21), t(12) = 1.41, p =0.175, were also

In Experiment 2, participants were trained on a vowel
harmony pattern with two suffixes, one which clearly
followed a harmony pattern (alternating between [-me] and
[-mo]) and the other ambiguous between a non-alternating
morpheme (e.g., [-go] only appearing in a back vowel
context).

Participants
All 13 participants were adults who were fluent English
speakers recruited from the psychology subject pool at

were also not significantly different from chance (mean =
0.38, SD = 0.24), t(12) = -1.75, p = 0.10, suggesting that
learners may have a small bias towards non-local, stem
controlled harmony in the presence of the disharmonic affix.
It is possible that while learners failed to successfully
select the [-go] suffix at a rate greater than chance for New
items, that this lack of success was based on the stems
containing a front vowel, which would create a disharmonic
sequence. To test this, responses to New-go items for front
vowel stems were separated from back vowel stems. While
back vowel stem (harmonic) items (mean = 0.80, SD =
0.16), t(12) = 6.63, p < 0.001 were significantly greater
than chance front vowel stem (disharmonic) items (mean =
0.37, SD = 0.34), t(12) = -1.41, p = 0.18 were not, and
trended towards harmony (as participants were lower than
chance). Participants chose the [-go] suffix items
significantly more when the stem vowels were back t(12) =
4.94, p < 0.001, indicating a bias towards harmony.
Because there were significantly different responses
towards front vowel stems compared to back vowel stems
for the [-go] suffix, it was important to compare the
alternating [-me/-mo] suffix as well. Both back vowel stem
items (mean = 0.75, SD = 0.30), t(12) = 3.09, p = 0.009 and
front vowel stem items (mean = 0.82, SD = 0.24), t(12) =
4.79, p < 0.001 were significantly greater than chance,
unlike the non-alternating [-go] suffix, there was no
significant difference between front and back stem vowel
responses t(12) = 0.63, p = 0.54, indicating a bias towards
harmony that was not affected by exposure to the
ambiguously non-alternating suffix.

a stem. Phonetic, phonological and psychological
constraints word to prevent changes in the stem, while
phonological processes work to promote changes (including
underspecification of features) in suffixes. Pilot data has
shown that the alternation bias found in the present
experiments disappears when the stimuli are presented as
single lexical items, rather than stem+suffix pairs,
suggesting that the alternation bias is based in
morphophonological alternations of affixes, which may be
more likely to be underspecified.

Implications for Language Learning and Change
The results of the present study have implications for how
languages with exceptional morphemes might be learned. If
learners are biased towards optionality (and therefore a
statistical harmony pattern) in ambiguous cases of
exceptions, it is possible that learners will, over time,
change a non-alternating morpheme to an alternating
morpheme. Previous research on the evolution of vowel
harmony languages in the Turkic language family cite
several key motivators that favor and disfavor harmony
(Harrison, Dras, & Kapicioglu, 2002), including frequency
in the lexicon and specification in the lexicon. While a nonalternating morpheme may in principle seem simple
(encoding [-go] rather than both [-ge] and [-go]), learners
may prefer an underspecified lexicon in which the backness
feature of the vowel is not stored, thus creating a simpler
stored lexical representation. There is some evidence for
overregularization of the non-alternating suffix [-ne] in
Hungarian to [-na] following a back vowel suffix This
overregularization is particularly striking because it is said
to last well into school years, and errors within vowel
harmony systems are extremely rare (Dasinger, 1997). This
suggests that language learners may show biases for
harmony over non-alternation, which may drive languages
to include more alternating suffixes. More research is
needed to understand how this process might work, as
changes in vowel inventory and loanword borrowings may
cause the number of alternating harmony morphemes to
decrease, rather than increase, which occurred in the
harmony system of Korean (Finley, 2010). In addition, it is
important to understand which phonological alternations
may drive a bias towards alternations, and which
alternations might drive non-alternations, as there is
evidence that stem-based alternations may show a bias
against alternations.

Discussion
The present study showed the results from two artificial
grammar learning experiments with a front/back vowel
harmony pattern in which one suffix alternated between
[-me] and [-mo] depending on the vowel quality of the stem
vowels. In Experiment 1, participants learned the behavior
of both the alternating and non-alternating suffixes, but were
more likely to select the non-alternating suffix when the
stem+suffix combination followed vowel harmony. In
Experiment 2, participants were only exposed to forms
containing the non-alternating suffix that obeyed harmony.
At test, when presented with disharmonic instances of the
stem-go items (with front vowel stems), participants were
not significantly different from chance, but trended towards
harmony for novel items. This suggests that learners
inferred that the ambiguously non-alternating suffix was
harmonic for back vowel stems, and optionally harmonic for
front vowel stems. This bias towards patterns of harmony
and optionality creates an overall pattern that is statistically
more harmonic than disharmonic.
These results show an alternation bias, while previous
results have shown a non-alternation bias (Coetzee, 2009;
Stave et al., 2013; White, 2014). In the present study,
learners were exposed to suffix alternations, while in
previous work, learners were exposed to alternations within

Agglutinative Test Items
The agglutinative test items were designed to probe whether
learners show a bias for locality when presented with a front
vowel suffix, followed by the non-alternating, disharmonic
suffix [-go] and the choice between [-me] and [-mo].
Choosing [-me] indicates a preference for stem-controlled
harmony, in violation of locality (as a the vowel [-go]
intervenes between the stem vowel and the final suffix
vowel). Choosing [-mo] indicates a preference for locality
over stem-control, as the source for harmony is the closest

702

vowel is the non-alternating suffix. Both experiments
trended towards non-locality, a violation of the locality
principles described in Finley (2010). There are a few
possible explanations for the effect. One possibility is that
learners did not form a stable representation of the vowel
harmony pattern. This lack of stability created a tie for the
alternation between [-me] and [-mo] to occur in any other
position besides a stem vowel. Another possibility is that the
bias towards stem-control may interfere with any locality
bias, showing no real bias within the data. A final possibility
is that the way in which the items were spliced may have
inadvertently favored the non-local items. Future research
will include a control condition to investigate any initial
biases that may be found within the stimuli.

Conclusions
The present study tested how adult, English speaking
learners analyze exceptional, non-alternating morphemes.
Participants were able to learn the behavior of the
alternating morpheme, despite the presence of a
disharmonic,
non-alternating
morpheme.
However,
participants were more likely to select the correct form of
the non-alternating morpheme when it appeared in a
harmonic context. This suggests a bias for harmony over
non-alternation, which may have important implications for
the evolution of languages with vowel harmony patterns.
Interestingly, items that tested for a locality bias for the
exceptions did not show any significant bias, and a slight
trend toward non-locality, opposite of the typological
descriptions shown in Finley (2010). It is possible that a
clearer locality bias might be revealed for learners who
acquire the non-alternating suffix, or for novel suffixes that
were not presented as stem, stem+suffix pairs. Future
research will work to understand how learners interpret nonalternating exceptions to vowel harmony, and how these
exceptions interact with locality principles.
