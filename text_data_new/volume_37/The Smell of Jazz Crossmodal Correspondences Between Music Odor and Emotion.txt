Abstract
People can systematically match information from different
senses, and these matches are known as crossmodal
correspondences. Most work on these correspondences has
explored how they might arise through neural mechanisms,
statistical covariance in the environment, or semantic
associations (e.g., Spence, 2011). Recently, Palmer, Schloss,
Xu, & Prado-León (2013) demonstrated that at least some
color-music correspondences can be explained by emotional
mediation. The present study investigates the emotion
mediation hypothesis for correspondences between odor and
music, testing whether the strength of odor-music matches for
particular odors and musical selections can be predicted by
the similarity of the emotional associations with the odors and
music. We found that perceived matches were higher when
the emotional responses were similar and that a model
including emotional dimensions captured a significant amount
of the variance of match scores. These results provide new
evidence that crossmodal correspondences are mediated by
emotions.
Keywords: crossmodal; odor; music; emotion

Introduction
Listening to music or smelling a flower may seem to be
sense-specific, but most experiences are multisensory. For
instance, visual cues can influence how music is perceived
(e.g., Hodges, Hairston, & Burdette, 2005; Platz & Kopiez,
2012). Similarly, when encountering an odor, other senses
influence the interpretation of that odor and thus the nature
of people’s experience with it (e.g., Gottfried & Dolan,
2003; Seo & Hummel, 2011).
Questions about commonalties and integration across the
senses have been of interest to scholars from Aristotle
onward (Marks, 1978), and the study of crossmodal
correspondences has been robust in recent years. Spence

(2011) distinguished three types of correspondences:
structural, statistical, and semantic. In his classification,
structural correspondences arise because of similarities in
the information being provided by the different senses; for
instance, magnitude may be represented by neural
mechanisms that are common across modalities (e.g., bright
lights might be matched to louder sounds because they both
cause higher firing rates in the brain). Statistical
correspondences, however, arise via statistical learning;
regularities in the environment, such as the fact that larger
objects tend to create louder sounds, would cause a
corresponding internal link between senses. Semantic
correspondences are also learned, but relate to language; for
instance, “high” pitches and “high” elevations use the same
terminology, which could thus lead to an association
between pitch and elevation. Thus both statistical and
semantic correspondences are learned, but may arise
through different processes. However, it may be that
semantic correspondences also stem from statistical
covariance in the world; for instance, Parise, Knorre, &
Ernst (2014) showed that the use of the term high for pitch
reflects the statistics of natural scenes. Thus, as Spence,
noted, more than one of these three factors may contribute
to a particular crossmodal correspondence.
While this tripartite model explains a number of different
correspondences, Palmer, Schloss, Xu, & Prado-León
(2013) demonstrated that, for color and music, crossmodal
correspondences seem to be emotionally-mediated. They
argue that emotional mediation provides a more
parsimonious explanation for the correspondences they find
between color and music, color and emotional faces, and
music and emotional cases. They give three main reasons:
(1) all three correspondences yielded very high correlations
via their emotional associations, (2) the music-to-color

1326

correspondences were highly consistent across two different
cultural groups, and (3) there is no compelling evidence that
the specific correspondences (such as between fast, major
music and saturated, light, yellowish colors) actually relate
to covariance of the those stimuli in the world. Palmer,
Langlois, & Schloss (2015) extended these results by
demonstrating the strong role of emotion for color and
music associations with very precisely controlled single-line
melodies. Albertazzi, Canal, & Micciolo (2015) also found
that emotional adjectives such as “calm” and “happy”
played a role in associations between art and music. Thus
emotion may be a fourth factor important to understanding
crossmodal correspondences, consistent with suggestions by
Schifferstein & Tanudjaj (2004).
Some studies have already examined the link between
music and odors. For instance, Seo, Lohse, Luckett, &
Hummel (2013) found that music (such as Christmas carols
and the song “Y.M.C.A.”) and background sounds (such as
beach sounds and toothbrushing) could be matched with
specific odors and that those sounds could increase the
odor’s pleasantness when the sound and odor were
considered congruent. Crisinel & Spence (2012) showed
that participants consistently match odors such as candied
orange to musical notes with higher pitches than they do
odors such as coffee, and that some odors were
preferentially matched to notes created by particular musical
instruments. Crisinel, Jacquier, Deroy, & Spence (2013)
further investigated correspondences between olfactory
stimuli and the pitch and instrumental class of sound stimuli
and found that stimuli that were judged as happier and more
pleasant were consistently associated with higher pitches.
They noted the potential importance of emotional
dimensions for crossmodal correspondences, particularly
those involving odor. Taken together, these studies provided
evidence that people with normal perception can make
consistent, non-arbitrary associations between musical
sounds and odors. However, these studies used few actual
musical selections; Crisinel & Spence (2012) and Crisinel et
al., (2013) primarily used single notes as stimuli. Crisnel et
al., (2013) did have three musical selections specifically
composed to match specific odors, but participants only
selected the intended music as a match for one of their three
pairings. Moreover, they only considered a relatively limited
set of emotions (pleasantness, relaxing, and happy). In the
present study, we examine the nature of music-odor
associations, using a broad range of music and odor
selections and assessing several emotional dimensions to
determine whether the crossmodal correspondence is linked
to shared emotional associations.

Methods
Participants
40 undergraduate students at Occidental College
participated in the study and were compensated with a total
of $20. All gave informed consent and the Occidental

College Human Subjects Research Review Committee
approved the protocol.

Materials
Music Stimuli We used 15 different musical selections
from the 34 used by Whiteford, Schloss, & Palmer (2013) in
their investigation of music-color associations. These
selections were deliberately chosen to be as diverse as
possible in the nature of the emotions they elicited and
represented a broad array of musical genres. We reduced the
number of selections because smelling odors takes longer
than viewing colors, and we wanted to ensure the
experiment could be conducted in a reasonable amount of
time. To choose those 15, we used participant ratings of
each music excerpt along 10 semantic/emotional dimensions
provided by Whiteford et al. (2013). We excluded one of
their samples at the recommendation of the authors, and we
used ratings (n=15) to conduct a k-means analysis to cluster
the music that had similar ratings, as was done by Langlois,
Peterson, & Palmer (2014). We generated 15 clusters and
then selected the genres that were closest to the centroid of
each cluster. When there were two selections in a cluster,
we selected the genre that we thought would be better
known to our population. The samples we used were from
the genres called Bach, Balkan Folk, Bluegrass, Blues,
Classic Rock, Dixieland, Eighties Pop, Funk, Gamelan,
Heavy Metal, Hindustani Star, Jazz, Piano, Psychobilly, and
Reggae (as labeled by Whiteford et al.; the specific music
samples can be provided upon request). Each selection was
15 seconds in duration.
Odor Stimuli We used 15 Sniffin’ Stick pens imported
from Germany. These included both pleasant and unpleasant
familiar odors and have been previously used in other
psychophysical research (e.g., Hummel, Sekinger, Wolf,
Pauli, & Kobal, 1997; Schloss, Goldberger, Palmer, &
Levitan, 2015). The odors tested in this experiment were
apple, banana, cinnamon, cloves, coffee, fish, garlic, leather,
lemon, licorice, orange, peppermint, pineapple, rose, and
turpentine.
Dimensions We used 8 dimensions to rate each odor and
each music selection: Preference (Like vs. Dislike),
Familiarity (Familiar vs. Unfamiliar), Intensity (Strong vs.
Weak), Anger (Angry vs. Not Angry), Pleasantness
(Pleasant/Harmonious vs. Unpleasant/Disharmonious),
Romance (Romantic/Sensual vs. Not-Romantic/NotSensual), Energy (Energizing vs. Calming), and Happiness
(Happy vs. Sad). We used a continuous scale and
descriptors of each dimension were provided at each
extreme. The dimensions were derived by reviewing past
studies on color-music associations (Palmer et al., 2011),
the Geneva Emotion and Music Scale (Zentner, Grandjean,
& Scherer, 2008) and the Universal Emotion and Odor
Scale (Ferdenzi et al. 2013), and then selecting dimensions
likely to apply to both music and odors.

Procedure

selections would autoplay and loop until the participant
made their ratings.

Participants completed three tasks over the course of two
consecutive days. On Day 1 they completed the music-odor
matching task, in which they rated the degree of match
between each of the 15 odors and 15 musical selections. On
Day 2 they completed the music-emotion and odor-emotion
rating tasks, rating each musical selection and each odor on
the 8 dimensions listed above, in random order.

Results and Discussion
The primary question of interest is whether emotions might
mediate the matches between odors and music. Thus, we
compared the match ratings and the similarity of ratings on
the 8 different dimensions. For each pairing, we calculated
the mean association score across all participants as well as
the mean similarity for each of the 8 ratings for the two
stimuli (see below). The highest mean match rating was
between cloves and Hindistani Sitar and the lowest mean
rating was between fish and Bach. We therefore expected
that cloves and Hindistani Sitar would be rated relatively
similarly on the relevant dimensions, whereas fish and Bach
would be rated quite differently on those dimensions. We
were particularly interested in which dimensions were the
best predictors of the match scores. Figure 1 depicts the
match scores for each of the 225 odor-music combinations.

Music-Odor Matching Ratings We first presented
participants with each of the odors and each of the musical
selections so they could familiarize themselves with the
stimuli. We then presented each of the 15 odors paired with
each of the 15 musical selections (225 odor-music pairs).
For each pair, participants rated how much the odor and
music matched each other using a continuous scale from
“very poorly” matched, to “very well” matched. The
musical selections would autoplay and loop until
participants made their rating. The combinations were
blocked by odor with the order of the odors randomized.
Within each odor block, the order of the musical selections
was randomized. Participants sniffed their arm after each
odor to neutralize its scent before sniffing the next odor. An
air purifier ran continuously throughout the experiment and
overnight to eliminate residual odor from the air.

selections and the odors within the blocks. The musical

Figure 3: Mean dimensional ratings for each odor.
We then conducted a multiple regression with the match
scores as the outcome measure and the similarity scores on
the 8 different dimensions as the predictor variables. Figures
2 and 3 show the mean dimensional ratings for each musical
selection and odor. For each dimension, we calculated the
similarity in rating for each odor-music combination as 100
minus the absolute value of the difference in the two ratings.
Of those 8 dimensions, we found that there was collinearity

between preference (VIF = 8.255) and pleasantness (VIF =
10.701); we also found that these two variables were
significantly correlated with each other, r = 0.923, p <
0.0005. All other VIF values were less than 3. Thus we
decided to remove pleasantness from the model, but allowed
the other 7 dimensions to remain (though many of these
were also significantly correlated). The multiple regression
analysis on the reduced set of factors showed that the model

1329

was able to capture a significant amount of the variance,
with an overall R2 = 0.578; F(7,217) = 42.491, p < 0.0005.
Table 1 gives the Beta weights and significance of each of
the reduced dimensions, 5 of which were statistically
significant: anger, romance, happiness, preference, and
intensity. Energy and familiarity were not statistically
significant. These results demonstrate that similarity in
emotional response predicts the strength of the match
between objects and odors. The negative weight of intensity
is likely due to all of the factors entering the model together,
as the correlation between similarity in intensity and match
score was positive. We therefore examined the correlations
separately between the similarity in each of the 8 features
and the match scores, as shown in Figure 4. With the
exception of familiarity, all of the factors were significantly
correlated with match score (all p < 0.0005). However, the
odors we used were all relatively familiar; a study including
unfamiliar odors might uncover a greater role for
familiarity. Odor learning can be very rapid (e.g., Li,
Luxenberg, Parris, Gottfried, 2006), however, so it is
possible that emotional responses to new odors could
change over the course of an experiment.
Overall, our results were consistent with the emotionalmediation hypothesis. However, there were some notable
differences between our results and past work on color and
music associations. Whiteford et al. (2013) had participants
rate colors and musical selections on 10 dimensions, several
of which overlapped with our dimensions. They found
highly significant correlations between color-music matches
and similarity of emotional content for 9 of their dimensions
(Appealing vs. Disgusting, Calm vs. Agitated, Complex vs.
Simple, Happy vs. Sad, Harmonious vs. Disharmonious,
Loud vs. Quiet, Spicy vs. Bland, Warm vs. Cool, Whimsical
vs. Serious) but only a slight correlation for preference. In
contrast, we found that preference ratings for music and for
odor were strongly correlated with music-odor matches and
did contribute to the regression model. Moreover,
preference ratings were highly correlated with
harmonious/pleasantness ratings in the present data. Why
the relationship among preference, harmoniousness, and
match ratings should differ for color-music and odor-music
correspondences remains an open question.
Further investigation of the nature of preferences may
help illuminate such questions. Odor preferences and color

preferences both can serve the important goal of helping us
determine what objects to approach/avoid (e.g., Herz,
Beland, & Hellerstein, 2004; Palmer & Schloss, 2010), and
typically one likes objects that one finds pleasant and
harmonious. However, for complex stimuli such as music,
this relationship may be more complex; some people,
particularly experts, prefer music that they do not consider
harmonious (Palmer & Griscom, 2013). While there may be
some evolutionary reasons for preferring some types of
music over others (e.g., Gill & Purves, 2009), music and
emotion are closely linked (Blood & Zatore, 2001; Hunter
& Schellenberg, 2010).
Because our musical selections differed dramatically on
many dimensions, we cannot address what particular
musical features influence the emotional responses and the
crossmodal correspondences that we measured. Using
carefully controlled stimuli, as done by Palmer et al. (2015),
could allow precise tests of how musical features, such as
mode and tempo, influence crossmodal associations.
Previous studies have been rather mixed on the
universality of crossmodal correspondences; studies of
color-odor associations (Levitan et al, 2014) and colormusic associations (Palmer et al., 2013) have found
similarities across cultures, but for visual-taste
correspondences, substantial differences across cultures
have been identified (Wan, Woods, van den Bosch,
McKenzie, Velasco, & Spence, 2014). It is likely that
emotional responses to music and odors are, at least in part,
culturally specific. If so, the emotional-mediation
hypothesis would predict that the crossmodal matches
would differ depending on the underlying emotions elicited
by the music and odor selections.
In summary, crossmodal correspondences between odors
and music are likely to be mediated by emotion. These
results thus strengthen the possibility that affective
correspondences constitute a fourth type of crossmodal
correspondence.
