Abstract
At the core of every decision-making task are two
simple features; outcome values and probabilities. Over
the past few decades, many models have developed
from von Neumann’ and Morgenstern’s (1945)
Expected Utility Theory to provide a thorough account
of people’s subjective value and probability weighting
functions. In particular, one such model that has been
largely successful in both Psychology and Economics is
Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT; Tversky &
Kahneman, 1992). While these models do fit people’s
choice behavior well, few models have attempted to
provide a psychological account for subjective value,
probability weighting, and resulting choice behavior. In
this paper, we focus on a memory confusion process as
described in Hawkins et al.’s (2014) exemplar-based
model for decisions from experience, the Exemplar
Confusion (ExCon) model, and adapt it to account for
biased probability estimates in decisions from
description. Using Bayesian model selection
techniques, we demonstrate that it is able to account for
real choice data from a Rieskamp (2008) study using
gains, losses, and mixed description-based gambles,
and performs at least as well as CPT.

Introduction
In a standard ‘Decision from description’ task, participants
are asked to choose between two gambles, A and B. For
example, gamble A may involve winning $4 with
probability of 0.80, or receiving nothing otherwise. Gamble
B may involve winning $3 with certainty. Expected utility
theory (von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1947) suggests that a
decision-maker combines probabilities of outcomes with
subjective values to formulate a decision over which gamble
they prefer, according to a set of axioms. In this scenario,
an expected utility maximizer with a linear utility function
would prefer gamble A, since
𝑈 𝑊 =   𝑐𝑊
𝑈! = 0.8×𝑐×4 + 0.2×𝑐×0 = 3.2𝑐  and  𝑈! = 3𝑐  
𝑈! > 𝑈!
where W is the value of the outcome and c is a constant.
However, violations of the axioms underlying this process
have been observed, and thus the notion of a subjective nonlinear weighting of probabilities was introduced by Savage
(1954) and eventually incorporated into Kahneman and
Tversky’s (1979) well-known Prospect Theory.
One caveat of these mathematical, expected-utility
models is that they are merely descriptive formulations of

decision-making, and largely neglect the underlying
cognitive processes and reasons for the phenomena (e.g.
why people exhibit diminishing sensitivity to increases in
value). While it may be argued that people do deliberately
participate in complex mathematical processing when
making a decision, several studies in which information
search is tracked have shown that this is not the likely case
even for people of higher cognitive ability (Payne &
Braunstein, 1978; Cokely & Kelley, 2009; Glöckner &
Herbold, 2011).
Apart from these more descriptive and mathematical
models, there are some models that attempt to provide an
explanatory, psychological account of decision-making. For
example, the Priority Heuristic (Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, &
Hertwig, 2006) provides a search-and-stop account of the
way in which people evaluate aspects of a gamble, and the
Primed Sampler Model (Erev, Glozman, & Hertwig, 2008)
proposes that the mere presentation of outcomes and context
impacts mental representations of gamble outcomes and
probabilities. However, these psychological accounts remain
few in number as the traditional focus of decision-making
studies has been to develop models which fit more and more
data, resulting in models such as Cumulative Prospect
Theory (CPT; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) and, on an
extreme end, the Ensemble model (Erev et al., 2010) that
tend to have many free parameters and potentially over-fit
the data.
A secondary limitation of these mathematical theories lies
in the fact that they are unable to account for decisions from
experience, where participants sequentially sample
outcomes from an unknown distribution to form an estimate
of the outcome probabilities in a gamble. This is due to two
main reasons. Firstly, the mathematical models developed in
the description paradigm tend to utilize the explicit
knowledge of the probabilities and outcomes in the gamble,
which are not explicitly provided in the experience
paradigm. Secondly, the rigidity of the formulae prohibit
them from accounting for the inverse probability weighting
function observed in decisions from experience (i.e., where
people underweight instead of overweight small
probabilities), without adding additional parameters and
running the risk of over-fitting data.
Thus, instead of extending a mathematical model of
decisions from description to account for decisions from
experience, we aim to do the opposite with a process model.
In this paper, we apply the underlying mechanism of how
people form probability estimates of outcomes in an
exemplar-based process model for decisions from

1374

experience – the Exemplar Confusion Model (ExCon;
Hawkins et al., 2014) – to decisions from description. Our
choice of model was largely based on convenience, and we
view this work as something of a proof-of-concept.
We show that the model can reproduce the complex
pattern of over-estimation and under-estimation of
probabilities in decisions from description and experience
respectively. Finally, we use Bayesian model selection to
show that ExCon performs well when compared to a widely
accepted benchmark model in the description paradigm –
CPT. We begin by defining the models more formally.
Cumulative Prospect Theory
In Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky & Kahneman,
1992), people prefer the gamble with the highest weighted
utility, U, which is calculated using subjective values and
probabilities.

While CPT has generally been hailed to be a successful,
benchmark theory in both psychology and economics
(Abdellaoui, 2000; Erev et al., 2010; Camerer, 1998), it is
not without problems. Aside from the afore-mentioned issue
of being a largely descriptive rather than an explanatory
model, more in-depth analysis of CPT parameters reveal
that its parameter space is not well-constrained. In a
parameter recovery study, Nilsson, Rieskamp, and
Wagenmakers (2011) found that the effect of loss aversion
could be created even without the loss aversion parameter
(λ) by allowing the value function parameters (α and β) to
take on different values. Similarly, Scheibehenne & Pachur
(2014) found that the choice sensitivity parameter (θ)
appeared to tradeoff with the value function parameter (α).
With such potential trade-offs between parameter values, it
is evident that the CPT cannot reliably provide
psychological insight into decision-making behavior.

Regardless, the flexibility of the parameter space does
allow the CPT to fit data relatively well and it will serve the
purpose of model comparison in this paper.
Exemplar Confusion Model
The Exemplar Confusion (ExCon) model developed by
Hawkins et al. (2014) provides a process explanation for
biased probability estimates in decisions from experience. In
the ‘Decisions from experience’ paradigm, participants are
not given a description of the outcomes and probabilities for
gambles A and B, but rather must learn about them through
experience. Participants are thus presented with outcomes
from gambles, and must infer the probability of those
outcomes. Finally, after a suitable number of samples from
each gamble have been experienced, the participant chooses
between gambles A and B.
In the ExCon model for experience, people store a
memory trace for each outcome they encounter. However,
like other models of risky-choice (Erev, Glozman, &
Hertwig, 2008), participants are assumed to have an
imperfect memory. In ExCon, there is an assumed limit on
the accuracy with which memory traces are stored. With
probability, pI, the participant commits a confusion error,
and fails to store the outcome that should be associated with
the current sample, and instead stores something else.
Other models have included process-based mechanisms
to produce sub-optimal performance. For example, Bhatia’s
(2014) added a distraction process to the evidence
accumulation process of Decision Field Theory (DFT;
Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993). Machiori, Guida and
Erev’s (2015) Noisy Retrieval Model (NRM) posits that
biased probability estimates arise from both a reliance on
small samples and confusion with previously encountered
outcome distributions in the retrieval process. However,
unlike Bhatia’s (2014) extension of DFT and the NRM, we
posit that the error occurs in memory storage and not in the
attentional or retrieval processes, respectively.
ExCon Model for Experience

Figure 1. The ExCon Model Process for Decisions from
Experience

1375

In decisions from experience, when a confusion error
occurs, the new exemplar (i.e. outcome) is confused with a
previously stored exemplar. As illustrated by Figure 1, at
the 10th draw of an outcome from a gamble, the new
exemplar (in this case, the rare outcome ‘Y’) will be
confused with probability, pI. If there is no confusion, then
the outcome will be accurately stored in memory. However,
if there is confusion, then one of the previously encountered
outcomes is stored instead. The probability that a previously
encountered outcome is stored is equal for all previously
encountered items in memory. So in the case of the example
in Figure 1, the probability that the participant will encode
the outcome ‘Y’ if a confusion occurs, pM, is 0.5.
ExCon Model for Description

The ExCon model for Description naturally predicts an
overestimation of small probabilities. However, the ExCon
for Experience, as described thus far, also predicts an
overestimation of small probabilities (for all but the smallest
of probabilities and number of samples). However, it is
possible to adapt the ExCon model for Experience to
produce an underestimation of small probabilities. The
overestimation of small probabilities occurs because
confusion errors lead to the sampled outcome being
replaced by either outcome with equal probability, once
both outcomes have been observed. That is, the confusion
error leads to the storage of previously observed outcomes
with a probability of 0.5 when there are 2 stored outcomes.
As such, ExCon will overestimate the probability of an
outcome whenever its true probability is smaller than 0.5.
A simple change to the confusion error process in ExCon
for Experience allows the model to underestimate small
probabilities. We assume that whenever a confusion error
occurs, the participant stores a random sample from the set
of outcomes already in memory. So, instead of storing
previously observed outcomes with equal probability (e.g.,
0.5 when there are two outcomes), the previously observed
outcomes are stored with probability equal to the rate at
which the outcomes have been observed up until this point.
Returning to Figure 1, the probability that the outcome ‘Y’
is stored is no longer 0.5, but is now 1/6, as the participant
had stored 5 ‘X’ outcomes and 1 ‘Y’ outcome.

Figure 2. The ExCon model process for Decisions from
Description
In this paper, we adapt the ExCon model for the
description paradigm. The ExCon for description assumes
that people mentally simulate a set of sample gamble
outcomes. The number of mental simulations for each
gamble, K, varies across individuals. The confusion process
occurs with probability pI. As shown in Figure 2, when a
confusion error occurs, the outcome for a given mental
simulation is a random choice of one of the possible
outcomes.
Note that this is different than in the ExCon for
Experience, where outcomes can only be confused with
memory traces (i.e., outcomes already sampled). In ExCon
for Description, because participants have been presented
with all possible outcomes when the gambles are described,
we assume that confusions can occur for all possible
outcomes regardless of whether they have been previously
mentally simulated.
Description-Experience Gap
The “Description-Experience (DE) Gap” is a phenomenon
that has been widely observed across decision-making
studies, whereby people choose as if they underweight small
probabilities in decisions from experience, while choosing
as if they overweight them in decisions from description
(Hertwig et al., 2004; Hau et al., 2008; Camilleri & Newell,
2013).

Figure 3. Simulation of the ExCon model produces biased
probability estimates in decisions from experience and
description. The confusion probability was 0.1 for these
simulations.
The left panel of Figure 3 shows that this adapted version
of the ExCon for Experience underestimates small
probabilities, especially for small samples. In larger
samples, however, the probability estimates become less

1376

biased, as the memory store of exemplars necessarily have a
sample probability, pM, which is closer to the true
probability, on average (Figure 3). In this scenario, even if
the exemplar is confused, the probability of a rare outcome
being stored as itself is approximately the true probability of
the rare outcome occurring, pM≈p.
On the other hand, the ExCon model for Description
generates probability estimates that over-estimate small
probabilities. Small probabilities are over-estimated because
a confusion error leads to a rare events having an inflated
probability of being stored. As a result, the probability
estimates for both rare and likely outcomes tend towards
0.5, overestimating small probabilities and underestimating
large probabilities (right column of Figure 3). With a larger
number of mental simulations, this effect becomes more
pronounced because there is a relatively larger proportion of
exemplar confusions in the set.
Comparing ExCon and CPT
In addition to producing the characteristic overestimates of
low probability events, the ExCon for Description is able to
account for real data. To show that ExCon predicts
participants’ choices, we compare to a well-established
benchmark model, the CPT. We use the data from Study 2
in Rieskamp (2008) to compare the ExCon and CPT.
Nilsson et al. (2011) showed that a hierarchical extension of
CPT was capable of fitting well the data from Rieskamp’s
(2008) study, thus ensuring that the CPT model provides a
good yardstick for the ExCon model. Also, since the
gambles in this data set were generated so as to span a wide
range of outcomes and probabilities, they should provide a
good basis for comparison of the two models. The data set
consists of 30 participants, who each contribute 180 pairs of
gambles; of which, 60 had only positive outcomes, 60 had
only negative outcomes, and 60 had both positive and
negative outcomes.
We use Bayes factors to compare the two models. The
Bayes factor tells us how much more likely the observed
data is under Model A than Model B. Formally, the Bayes
factor is the ratio of the marginal likelihood of the observed
!(!|!! )
data, D, for each model, Mi, such that 𝐵𝐹!" =
. The

The CPT model we fit had 6 parameters. The top row of
Figure 4 contains a plot of the prior distributions for the
parameters of the CPT model. For the value function
parameters, α and β, we used N(0.5,0.15) distributions1. For
the loss aversion parameter, λ, we used an F(5,20)
distribution that was shifted to begin at 0.35 and scaled by
1/2. For the probability weighting function parameters, γ
and δ, we used N(0.55,0.05). For the choice sensitivity
parameter, φ, we used an F(3,5) distribution shifted to start
at 0.05 and scaled by 1/3.
We used an ExCon model with 4 parameters. The model
as described thus far has just two parameters – the
probability of a confusion, pI, and the number of mental
simulations that the participant undertakes before making
their decision, K. For the pI parameter we used a Beta
distribution with shape parameters of 3 and 20. For the K
parameter we used an F(5,20) distribution whose output was
multiplied by 30. We also found it necessary to include a
value function in ExCon, and so assumed that
−(−𝑥)! ,
𝑥<0
𝑣(𝑥) =
𝑥!,
𝑥≥0
Finally, we assumed that the output of ExCon, the average
utility of each gamble based on the mental simulations, was
transformed into a choice probability via the same softmax
function as used in CPT. The prior distributions for the α
and ψ parameters are the same in ExCon as they are in CPT.

!(!|!! )

marginal likelihood for each model is given by 𝑃 𝐷 𝑀 =
𝑃 𝐷 𝜃, 𝑀 𝑃 𝜃, 𝑀 𝑑𝜃, where 𝑃 𝐷 𝜃, 𝑀 is the likelihood
of a set of parameters 𝜃, and 𝑃 𝜃, 𝑀 is the prior probability
of those parameters. The marginal likelihood can be
interpreted as the likelihood of the model for all parameter
values of the model, weighted by the prior probability of
those parameter values.
The Bayes factor requires that we specify the prior
probability of the parameters of each model. We now define
the prior distributions we placed on the parameters of each
model. We chose to use moderately informative priors,
based on values that are commonly observed in the literature
(e.g., Nilsson et al., 2008). Figure 4 contains a plot of the
prior distributions we used for each of the model
parameters.

models. The left column contains the parameters that are
only in the CPT model. The center column contains the
parameters found in both models. The right column contains
the parameters found in only the ExCon model.

Note that parameters with bounds were truncated at those
bounds. For example, the α and β parameters were truncated to be
between 0 and 1.

1377

We estimate the Bayes factors for each model by
evaluating the likelihood of the model across a wide range
of parameter values. In particular, for each parameter in
each model, we took the 0.05, 0.15,…,0.95 quantiles of the
relative prior distribution. We then evaluated the likelihood
of each of the 30 participants’ data for each model at all
combinations of these parameter values. Each of the
resultant likelihood values was then multiplied by the prior
probability of the parameter values. Finally, the average
across all of these weighted likelihoods was taken to give
the marginal likelihood for each model. The ratio of these
marginal likelihoods gives us the Bayes factor for each of
the 30 individuals.
The likelihood of a set of parameters in the CPT model
can be calculated analytically. However, in the ExCon
model, the probability that a gamble is chosen depends on
the particular sequence generated via mental simulation,
with stochasticity in both the simulated gambles and the
confusion process. We know of no analytical solution for
such a doubly-stochastic process. Therefore, we use
simulation to generate likelihoods from the model, using
5000 simulations per parameter set.
Figure 5 plots the log Bayes factors for each of the 30
participants from Rieskamp (2008). For 19 of the 30
participants, the ExCon model provides an unequivocally
better account of the data than the CPT model. Two
participants had Bayes factors for whom the evidence for
both models were ‘equivalent’ (i.e., between 1/3 and 3). The
remaining 9 participants were clearly better fit by the CPT
model.

Figure 5. Log Bayes factors for each of the 30 participants
from Rieskamp (2008). Values greater than 0 correspond to
Bayes factors suggesting that the ExCon model was more
likely to have generated the observed data than the CPT
model. The dotted lines indicate Bayes factors of 3 and 10
(and 𝟏 𝟑 and 𝟏 𝟏𝟎).

Discussion
We have shown that a relatively simple model of decisionmaking, originally developed to account for decisions from
experience, is also able to account for data in decisions from
description. The model naturally produces an overestimation
of small probabilities, and is shown to predict empirical data
at least as well as the CPT model – a common benchmark
model of decision-making.
Bayesian model selection is dependent on priors. Most
concerning is our prior on the number of mental
simulations. More work must be done to investigate the
nature of the mental simulations, since the number of
simulations will depend critically on the mental simulation
process.
We must also work to provide further justification for
why the confusion processes operate differently under
decisions from description and experience. In the
description condition, when memory confusion occurs,
outcomes are replaced with equal probability. One potential
explanation is that observers are influenced by the outcomes
that remain onscreen, placing equal attention to both
outcomes. In decisions from experience, participants must
rely on their memories of sampled outcomes, and so
outcomes are replaced based on the contents of memory.
When fitting the ExCon to the decisions from description
data, we found it necessary to transform raw outcome values
into utilities, and to include a softmax decision rule.
Without these extra assumptions, the ExCon model was far
too deterministic in its predictions, when compared with the
more ‘random’ behavior of participants.
By including the decision rule and the utility function into
ExCon, the model becomes very similar to CPT. The
distinguishing feature of ExCon is that it places a processbased account of the under- and over-estimation of
probabilities. By constraining the probability-weighting
function to follow a particular process, the ExCon model is
also constrained in the range of predictions that it makes.
Since the observed data are relatively consistent with those
predictions, the Bayes factor prefers the ExCon model over
the CPT model.
A promising avenue for future work would be to attempt
to develop process-based accounts for the value function
and decision rule components of CPT (and ExCon). The
decision-rule, for example, could be replaced with process
models for decisions. Though less explored than the
decision rule, it seems possible that the value function may
come about through sequential effects. For example, the
assimilation effect says that stimuli and responses on the
current trial are more like those from the previous trial. As
such, the discount in utility of rare, large outcomes may
come about because their utility is assimilated towards the
more common, smaller outcomes.
In decisions from experience, another potential avenue of
study would be to develop a psychological account for
exploration-exploitation strategies. In a repeated choice
paradigm where each choice is consequential, the switch
from exploration to exploitation strategies is gradual, while

1378

exploitation only occurs with the single choice made only at
the end in a sampling paradigm. As each choice is
consequential, participants have to decide when to stop
exploring the gambles’ outcome distributions and start
exploiting the preferred gamble for the best total reward.
One model that attempts to capture this switch is the
Instance-Based Learning model (IBL; Gonzalez & Dutt,
2011), which tracks the rate of alternation between choices
instead of the rate of choosing a choice. The IBL also
utilizes an inertia parameter at the start of each trial and
suggests that the probability of exhibiting inertia in choice,
pInertia, is selected from a uniform distribution between 0
and 1 each time. However, in reality, it is likely that the
inertia increases over time as people become more confident
in their preference, thus resulting in a gradual transition
from exploration to exploitation in the repeated choice
paradigm. Finally, the performance of the ExCon with more
specific choice paradoxes and potential manipulation of the
confusion process (for example, changing the presentation
of outcomes to make confusion less likely) could be
explored. If support for methods that lessened memory
confusion in decision-making were found it would lend
weight to the processing assumptions made in the ExCon
framework.
