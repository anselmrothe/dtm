Abstract
Symbolic and non-symbolic number representations are
thought to share common neural substrates. However, recent
studies have shown that the two numerical systems are more
distinct than previously thought. These disparate findings may
be explained by the use of sequential presentations of symbolic and non-symbolic quantities, the use of magnitude-reliant
tasks, or the use of limited number ranges. We investigated
whether adults integrate symbolic and non-symbolic numerical information during a non-magnitude-based task in which
symbolic and non-symbolic double-digit numerical information is shown simultaneously. Participants viewed images
in which symbolic numerals or letter pairs were superimposed
on non-symbolic numerical stimuli and were asked to determine whether the text was a numeral or letter, ignoring the
dots. After perceptual biases were taken into account, participants were more accurate and faster in their judgments when
symbolic and non-symbolic information matched than when
information mismatched, suggesting that adults can integrate
symbolic and non-symbolic numerical information.

Introduction
Educated humans have access to two types of numerical
representations: exact, i.e., symbolic, number representations and approximate, i.e., non-symbolic, magnitude representations. These magnitude representations are thought to
be at the core of the approximate number system (ANS),
which imprecisely represents numerical quantities such that
quantities at close ratios (e.g., ‘12’ and ‘18’) are harder to
discriminate than quantities at distant ratios (e.g., ‘12’ and
‘30’) (Dehaene, 1992; Nieder & Dehaene, 2009). For educated human adults, symbolic and non-symbolic representational systems appear to overlap to a high degree, such that
seeing a numeric symbol will activate a representation of its
associated magnitude. For example, fMRI studies have
found overlapping regions of activation when people view

symbolic and non-symbolic numerical stimuli (e.g., Dehaene, Dehaene-Lambertz, & Cohen, 1998; Fias, Lammertyn,
Reynvoet, Dupont, & Orban, 2003) and when people perform mental addition on symbolic and non-symbolic stimuli
(Venkatraman, Ansari, & Chee, 2005). Habituation paradigms also provide support for overlap. When the same numeric quantity is presented multiple times, the hemodynamic response associated with that quantity is diminished, even
when the presentation format shifts between symbolic and
non-symbolic notations (e.g., Kallai, Schunn, & Fiez, 2012;
Piazza, et al., 2004). This suggests that the same neurons are
activated when processing symbolic and non-symbolic numerical stimuli. Critically, higher levels of this “symbolic
integration” are thought to support mathematical problem
solving and math achievement (Geary, 2013; Holloway &
Ansari, 2009).
However, recent behavioral and neuroimaging evidence
questions the commonalities between symbolic and nonsymbolic number representations. Symbolic numbers do not
always automatically and effortlessly activate non-symbolic
magnitudes (e.g., Lyons, Ansari, & Beilock, 2012; Wong &
Szucs, 2013). With regard to math achievement, it has been
found that both symbolic and non-symbolic representations
serve as resources for mathematical problem solving, but
that their contributions are unique, and the contribution of
non-symbolic representations weakens after six years of age
(Fazio, Bailey, Thompson, & Siegler, 2014). This suggests
that “symbolic estrangement” may be occurring, in which
mathematics depends primarily upon relations between
symbolic numerals, with little meaningful support from
ANS representations (Lyons, Ansari, & Beilock, 2012).
The differing perspectives on symbolic integration and
symbolic estrangement may reflect issues of measurement.
Most prior measures of symbolic integration are indirect:
participants experience sequences of stimuli (i.e., a symbolic numerical stimulus followed by a non-symbolic one, or
vice versa). Symbolic integration is thought to reflect experience in representing co-occurring and corresponding sym-

1404

bolic and non-symbolic stimuli, which is not well measured
by these sequential procedures. In addition, the majority of
prior studies require participants to make magnitude-based
judgments (e.g., number comparison judgments). Such tasks
could potentially prime the activation of one type of representation over the other, depending on the particulars of the
task. Furthermore, prior research suggests that the type of
magnitude judgments can influence the extent to which
symbolic integration is found (Lyons & Beilock, 2013).
Previous studies have also primarily investigated singledigit numbers or double-digit numbers of low quantity. It is
possible that sampling more heavily across the full doubledigit number range would also yield different integration
results. The current study seeks to address these issues by
using a novel experimental paradigm to assess symbolic
integration.
We wanted to test whether adults would show evidence of
symbolic integration when they are simultaneously presented with multi-digit symbolic and non-symbolic numerical
information (see Figure 1). Instead of asking participants to
make magnitude judgments, they completed a numerical
version of the lexical decision task (henceforth known as the
“Numberness task”), in which they judged whether text on a
stimulus showed a numeral or letter pair. The stimuli also
included non-symbolic number information in the form of a
dot cloud, which either matched or mismatched the symbolic information in quantity. Because the task did not require
magnitude processing, participants were not primed to process the stimuli through the ANS. This provided a cleaner
measure of whether participants naturally integrated the two
types of numerical formats. The paradigm’s design was inspired by prior research on integration effects in reading, in
which speech sounds are presented with matching or mismatching Arabic letters (e.g., Blau et al., 2010; Blomert,
2011). These designs, in turn, are based on a large body of
basic neuroscience research that suggests that symbolic integration should greatly enhance the response to matching,
coincident stimuli; as the level of symbolic integration increases, then the response difference between matching and
mismatching coincident stimuli should increase. For the
Numberness task, we hypothesize that adults will show effects of integration, such that performance will be better
when Arabic numerals and dot quantities match than when
Arabic numerals and dot quantities mismatch. Moreover,
this effect should only occur when the text shows a numeral,
but not when the text shows a letter pair.
If symbolic integration exists, then the symbolic numeral
shown on a stimulus could also influence participants’ perceptions of the stimulus’ dot quantity. Thus, a second group
of participants was asked to estimate the number of dots
shown in the Numberness stimulus images. We predicted
that participants would show some bias in their dot quantity
perceptions when paired with Arabic numerals, but not with
letters. If participants showed a perceptual bias, then this
could change what participants perceive as a symbolic and
non-symbolic “match” in the Numberness task. Consequently, people might only show better performance on matching

than mismatching trials in the Numberness task when these
biases are taken into account.

Methods
Participants
One hundred one adults participated in the study. Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk
(AMT), an online, crowd-sourced participant pool. Recruiters post tasks on AMT, which workers can choose to complete; if the work is satisfactory, then the recruiter can grant
approval and payment to the worker. All participants were
required to be located in the United States, to have at least
50 approved tasks, and to have an approval rate of 95% or
higher on the website, which is found to ensure high-quality
AMT data (Peer, Vosgerau, & Acquisti, 2014). Sixty-five
participants (36 female; age M = 38.2, SD = 13.7, range =
19-67 years; 57 with post-secondary education) completed
the Numberness task for $0.50, and 36 participants (17 female; age M = 37.0, SD = 12.0, range = 18-63 years; 24
with post-secondary education) completed the Dot Cardinality task for $1.00. Payment was based on the average time
taken to complete the task. Four participants from the Dot
Cardinality group were excluded from analyses because
they showed a misunderstanding of the task (e.g., typing
repeated sequences of numbers or typing the numeric text
instead of estimating the number of dots).

Materials
Stimuli Creation The dot clouds in the task stimuli were
created using the MATLAB script written by Dehaene, Izard, and Piazza (2005). To control for perceptual differences
in the stimuli, we created six images for each dot quantity
tested in the tasks. The images were created by manipulating dot size and total area occupied by the dots, such that
each dot quantity had images that used three different dot
sizes and two different total areas. Double-digit Arabic numerals or letter pairs (12 numerals, 12 letter pairs) were
superimposed at the center of each dot cloud (see Figure 1
for examples). Numerals ranged from 11 to 63, and dot
quantities ranged from 7 to 95 dots.

pair “num>dot,” “match,” and “num<dot” stimuli.

Numberness Task Participants were shown a series of images and asked to judge whether the image text showed a
symbolic numeral or a letter pair. Participants responded by
pressing “S” on a computer keyboard if the text was a numeral, and pressing “L” if the text was a letter pair. Each
image was shown for 400 ms, and participants were given
1.5 s to respond. The task included 576 trials, separated into
6 blocks of 96 problems each. Of those 576 trials, 288 of the
trials showed numerals and 288 of the trials showed letter
pairs. Within the numeral trials, 72 showed images where
the numeral and dot quantity matched (“match” trials), 72
showed images where the numeral was greater than the dot
quantity at a 1.5 ratio (“num>dot” trials; e.g., 17 dots paired
with the Arabic numeral “25”), 72 showed images where the
numeral was less than the dot quantity at a 1.5 ratio
(“num<dot” trials; e.g., 38 dots paired with the Arabic numeral “25”), and 72 showed images where only a numeral
was shown (“filler” trials). For the letter text trials, letter
pairs were randomly matched to numerals, such that specific
letter pairs were always paired with the same dot quantities
(e.g., “PN” was matched with the numeral “59,” so both
“PN” and “59” were always paired with dot quantities of 39,
59, and 89). Both numerals and their matched letter pair
were always paired with the same sets of dot clouds, such
that perceptual qualities of the stimuli were constant across
the two conditions. Thus, within the letter text trials, there
were also 72 trials of each type (match, num>dot, num<dot,
filler), though the actual relations between the letters and
dot quantities were arbitrary designations.
Dot Cardinality Task Participants were shown a series of
images and asked to estimate the number of dots shown in
the image. Participants typed in their estimates on a computer keyboard. Each image was shown for 400 ms, and
participants were given an unlimited amount of time to respond. The purpose of this task was to determine the psychological magnitude of the presented dot quantities in the
Numberness task; therefore, we reused the exact same stimuli from the Numberness task. Participants completed 432
trials: 144 involved “match” trials, 144 involved “num>dot”
trials, and 144 involved “num<dot” trials. Half of each trial
type contained numerals, and half contained letter pairs.

Procedure
After accepting the task on AMT, participants completed
either the Numberness task or the Dot Cardinality task. If
participants were given the Numberness task, they were
required to achieve 80% accuracy on a short practice block
of 10 trials before moving on to the real task.

Results
Numberness Task
Because we were primarily interested in the differences between match and mismatch (num>dot, num<dot) Numberness trials, we excluded all filler trials from the following
analyses. Two additional trials were also removed because

the stimulus images did not show correctly during those
trials. This left a total of 430 trials for analysis. Trials with
response times faster than 100 ms were excluded to eliminate trials in which participants had not processed the full
stimuli. Trials in which participants ran out of time to respond (e.g., took longer than 1.5s to respond) were also excluded to control for external environmental issues that may
have affected task performance.
To investigate the differences between matches and mismatches, we ran a 2 (text type: numeral, letter pair) X 3
(mismatch type: num>dot, match, num<dot) repeatedmeasures ANOVA on Numberness accuracy. Contrary to
our symbolic integration hypothesis, we found no significant interaction between text type and mismatch type [F(2,
128) = 2.13, p = 0.12, ηp2 = 0.03] (see Figure 3a). Overall,
participants responded more accurately when images had a
letter pair [M = 0.93, SD = 0.08] rather than a numeral [M =
0.91, SD = 0.06], [F(1, 64) = 20.3, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.24].
There were no differences between the mismatch types [F(2,
128) = 2.58, p = 0.08, ηp2 = 0.04].
A second 2 (text type: numeral, letter pair) X 3 (mismatch
type: num>dot, match, num<dot) repeated-measures ANOVA was run on median response times on correct Numberness trials. There was a significant interaction with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction [F(1.94, 124.2) = 13.6, p < 0.001,
ηp2 = 0.18] (see Figure 4a). For numeral trials, there was a
significant effect of mismatch type [F(1.92, 123.1) = 18.9, p
< 0.001, ηp2 = 0.23]. Post-hoc tests using a Bonferroni correction showed that match trials were significantly faster
than both num>dot trials [p = .02] and num<dot trials [p <
0.001]. A mismatch effect was also seen for letter pair trials
[F(1.91, 122.1) = 5.86, p = 0.004, ηp2 = 0.08] in the opposite
direction, such that match trials were significantly slower
than num<dot trials [p = 0.001]. The response time results,
but not accuracy results, provided partial support for symbolic integration.

Dot Cardinality Task
While the Numberness data did not show a strong integration effect, we wanted to see whether symbolic number information could influence non-symbolic number estimates
by comparing participants’ perceived dot quantity estimates
to the objective dot quantities shown in the stimuli. Because
several participants mistyped their estimates during the task,
we calculated each participant’s median estimate for each
dot quantity to remove potential outliers.
Regressions were run on median dot estimates, using objective dot quantity as a predictor (estimated dot quantity =
B1*objective dot quantity + B0). Separate regressions were
run for each trial type (match, num>dot, num<dot for numeric text trials; match, num>dot, num<dot for letter pair
trials), for a total of six regressions. If the symbolic numeral
on each stimulus has no influence on participants’ dot estimates, then the slopes of each regression should be equal.
The 95% confidence intervals of each regression’s slope
and intercept are shown in Table 1. For numeral trials, the
slopes of the num>dot and num<dot trials were significantly

1406

different from the slope of the match trials. Unexpectedly,
for letter pair trials, the num>dot trial slope also significantly differed from the match trial slope, though differences
between letter pair slopes were smaller than for numeral
slopes (see Figure 2). The slopes for all six regressions were
also significantly lower than a slope of 1, showing that participants are consistently overestimating small numbers of
dots and underestimating larger numbers of dots shown in
our stimuli.

rection, there was now a significant two-way interaction for
accuracy [F(1.33, 84.9) = 18.1, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.22] (see
Figure 3b). For the numeral trials, match trials (M = 0.95,
SD = 0.09) were significantly more accurate than num>dot
trials (M = 0.90, SD = 0.09) [p < 0.001] and num<dot trials
(M = 0.91, SD = 0.08) [p = 0.001]. There were no differences between match and mismatch trials for letter pair trials [F(2, 128) = 1.52, p = 0.22, ηp2 = 0.02]. For median response time, there was also a significant interaction with a
Greenhouse-Geisser correction [F(1.42, 91.1) = 19.7, p <
0.001, ηp2 = 0.24] (see Figure 4b). For numeral trials, there
was a mismatch effect [F(1.39, 88.9) = 16.9, p < 0.001, ηp2
= 0.20] such that match trials were significantly faster than
both num>dot [p < 0.001] and num>dot [p < 0.001] trials.
There was no such effect for letter pair trials [F(1.3, 85.1) =
3.32, p = 0.06, ηp2 = 0.05]. Thus, after adjusting for perceptual biases, match trials showed a consistent advantage over
mismatch trials in both accuracy and response time. In addition, this advantage was unique to stimuli that showed Arabic numerals.

Numberness Task After Adjustment
Given the estimation biases in participants’ dot quantity
perceptions, we wanted to see whether adjusting the dot
quantities in the Numberness task to reflect perceived dot
quantities, rather than actual dot quantities as used in our
previous analyses, would lead to greater differences between match and mismatch trials. A linear regression was
run on the Dot Cardinality median dot estimates, using objective dot quantity as a predictor. The regression only used
data from the letter text trials to avoid potential anchoring
influences caused by the numeric text. Because the pairings
between letter pairs and dot clouds were arbitrary, we collapsed across all three trial types. We derived the following
equation from the regression to predict participants’ perceived dot quantity, given the objective dot quantity on a
stimulus: Y = 0.72X + 6.62. The perceived dot quantity was
then used to re-categorize trials as match, num>dot, and
num<dot trials.
We reran 2 (text type: numeral, letter pair) X 3 (recategorized mismatch type: num>dot, match, num<dot)
repeated-measures ANOVAs on the Numberness task’s accuracy and response times. With a Greenhouse-Geisser cor-

The current study investigated whether adults would show
evidence of symbolic integration when symbolic and nonsymbolic number information was presented simultaneously. Specifically, we tested whether participants would perform better and more quickly when double-digit symbolic
and non-symbolic number knowledge matched than when it
mismatched. In the Dot Cardinality task, participants
showed biases in their perceptions of our stimuli’s nonsymbolic number information, such that they consistently
overestimated small quantities and underestimated large
quantities. When these biases were used to determine when
symbolic and non-symbolic information matched and mismatched in the Numberness task, then participants were
more accurate and faster at making judgments about symbolic numerical stimuli when non-symbolic information
matched than when it mismatched. No such effect occurred
when participants were making similar judgments on letter
stimuli. Accuracy differences between matching and mismatching trials did not appear when perceptual biases were
not accounted for, suggesting that the perceived nonsymbolic magnitudes are influencing performance rather
than incidental features of the stimuli. Adults appear to naturally integrate symbolic and non-symbolic number
knowledge, such that non-symbolic numerical information
influences judgments about symbolic numerical stimuli.
We also found some evidence that estimates of nonsymbolic quantities may be influenced by symbolic numerals. In the Dot Cardinality task, the slopes of participants’
estimates were significantly different when dot quantities
and symbolic quantities matched than when they mismatched. However, there were also some differences between slopes of letter pair trials, even though the matching
and mismatching designations were arbitrary, suggesting
that these slope differences may have been caused by something other than symbolic integration.

1407

The consistent over- and under-estimation of numbers
across both number and letter trials may also be evidence of
symbolic integration. The numerals used in the Dot Calibration task ranged from 11 to 63, with 26 as its average value.
This symbolic average may have biased participants’ nonsymbolic estimates across trials, which would fit with the
results seen, such that dots in the 20s were perceived accurately, values lower than the 20s were overestimated, and
values higher than the 20s were underestimated. Future
studies could test this form of integration by varying the
numerical range used in the task and investigating its effect
on estimates.

Measuring Symbolic Integration
Our results highlight the potential importance of presenting symbolic and non-symbolic information simultaneously
to detect symbolic integration. Previous studies have primarily utilized sequential presentations of symbolic and
non-symbolic number information, which may not fully
capture symbolic integration. Sequential designs may even
tap into different cognitive processes, or require more cognitive resources to keep sequential information in mind, which
could prevent these designs from uncovering integration in
adults. Furthermore, our study shows that perceptual biases
should be measured to determine how participants perceive
non-symbolic stimuli. This is especially important for any
paradigms utilizing the simultaneous presentation of symbolic and non-symbolic information, though it may also
inform sequential paradigms (e.g., determining the perceived ratio between non-symbolic comparisons, or creating
matched pairs of symbolic and non-symbolic trials).
Notably, the Numberness task used in the current study
was not magnitude-related, as task judgments were removed
from the magnitude of the stimuli. Yet, we still found magnitude-related results. Prior studies have often involved such
quantity-related judgments (e.g., asking participants to
compare two number quantities), which could prime people
to attend primarily to either symbolic or non-symbolic nu-

merical information. It would be informative to use the current study’s co-occurring stimuli in a wider range of tasks
that involve magnitude-related judgments to test the robustness of the matching and mismatching response differences.

Accounting for Individual Differences
In the current study, we adjusted the Numberness task data
using the Dot Cardinality task data, but the data was collected in a between-subject design. Prior studies have shown
that representational acuity of the ANS can vary greatly
across individuals (Halberda, Mazzocco, & Feigenson,
2008), and that it continues to develop even into adulthood
(Halberda, Ly, Wilmer, Naiman, Germine, 2012). Given the
individual differences in perceptual biases of non-symbolic
quantities, an average estimate of perceptual bias may not
be sufficient to determine what each individual perceives as
matching symbolic and non-symbolic numerical information. This may be an especially large problem in the current study because of the wide age range of participants.
Ideally, one should determine how each individual perceives
dot quantities, and then use that information to determine
when symbolic and non-symbolic information is perceived
as matching or mismatching. Future studies will measure
both participants’ symbolic integration performance and
their perceptual biases, such that task performance can be
individually adjusted.
In conclusion, the current study provides evidence for
symbolic integration in adults. Non-symbolic numerical
information appears to influence people’s classification of
double-digit Arabic numerals, even when that non-symbolic
information is irrelevant for the judgment at hand. Our findings emphasize the importance of developing both types of
number knowledge to best support performance in numberrelated tasks.
