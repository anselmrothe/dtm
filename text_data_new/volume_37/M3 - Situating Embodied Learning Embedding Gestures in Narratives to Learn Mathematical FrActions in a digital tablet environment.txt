Abstract
Researchers developed Iteration-1 of a digital tablet tutorgame exploring the impact of narratives (strong (S) vs. weak
(W)) and gestural mechanics (conceptual (C) vs. deictic (D))
on players’ understanding of mathematical fractions. In a
two-by-two factorial design, 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade elementary
students at an afterschool program in Harlem, NYC
(NTTL=72; x̄ AGE=10.31 years [1.64], 67% female) were
randomly assigned to play one of the four tutor-game
environments (SC, SD, WC, WD). Pre/post scores on formal
fractions assessments showed significant learning for all
groups.
Tutor-log data revealed that students using
conceptual gestures were significantly more accurate at
estimating and denominating fractions than students using
deictic gestures. Observational notes, student exit surveys and
clinical interviews corroborated that many students used the
tutors’ gestures in their explanations of fractions. This
collection of data is used to discuss the impact of gesture and
narrative on learning fractions and digital-tutor design.

Introduction
How can cognitive scientist turn ideas into learning
opportunities on digital tablets? With many of the tenets of
contemporary education emphasizing learning in our
experiential cohorts (Dewey, 1938/1963), society
(Vygotsky, 1934/1978) and culture (Bruner, 1966), digital
tablet simulations are opportunities to situate learners in an
environment (Lave, 1988) and utilize the gestural interface
as a means for grounding cognition (Barsalou, 2008).
Moreover, combining familiar experiences and augmenting
them with fantastical ones can motivate learners to explore
unknown problems spaces and allow them to consider the
choices in their own learning (Cordova & Lepper, 1996;
Schwartz & Arena, 2009).
For years, a vast selection of educational titles amounted
to little more than interactive worksheets, drills or quizzes,
without leveraging cognitive principles and superficially
inserting content onto an arbitrary narrative with arbitrary
game mechanics that fail to motivate users much less help
them learn mathematics (Riconscente, 2011). Fortunately,
newer games-like tutors supported by research like Motion
Math
(motionmathgames.com)
and
Math
Glow

(igeneration.com) are designing activities that leverage the
gestural interface of digital tablets.
In the current study, we developed a tutor-game for a
digital tablet to investigate how gestures and narratives
impact performance and learning of mathematical fractions.
First, will embodying the procedural actions for fracturing
objects using different gestures, hence “FrActions”, impact
students’ explicit, implicit and tacit learning and knowledge
(Broaders, Cook, Mitchell & Goldin-Meadow, 2007)?
Second, can a strong narrative (based on the Emmy award
winning PBS Television series, Cyberchase) engage
learners by helping contextualize the problem space
(Graesser, Hauft-Smith, Cohen, & Pyles, 1980) better than a
sparsely weak narrative?
Of course, capturing learning is not just about
performance.
Soderstrom & Bjork (2015) recently
addressed how performance assessments often fail to
capture student learning. Education, as an applied field,
can only capturing student learning if it is sensitive to the
context in which it was learned (Brown, 1992). If we take
learning as “co-constituted” with the environment (Barab
and Squire, 2004), then evaluations of the students, who sit,
headphones on, playing a tutor-game on a digital tablet,
must come from multiple sources of data. Thus, the current
study integrated formal assessments, tutor-data logs,
observations, exit surveys and clinical interviews to evaluate
4 versions of a digital tablet math tutor-game: Mobile
Movement Mathematics: Iteration 1 (M3:i1).

Theoretical Background
Tutor-games provide learners with dynamic experiences
that channel their visual, aural and haptic perceptions into
their cognitions (Baddeley, 1986; Ricker, AuBuschon &
Cowan, 2010). Digital tablets are portals that educators can
use to situate learning in contexts for connecting concepts
(Barab et al., 2007; Brown, Collins & Duguid, 1989; Lave,
1988; Schwartz & Bransford, 1999) and the gesturally
haptic interface is an opportunity to embody their conceptual
development (Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg, 1999; Lakoff &
Johnson, 1980). The affordances (Gibson, 1977) of a
tablet’s digital ecology enable researchers to craft
experiences that have yet their own affordances, giving
students freedom to explore while their learning is guided
by scaffolding and feedback (Dewey, 1938/1963).

Developing Fractions Tutor-Game (Iteration-1)
Fractions begin with the actions of fracturing.
Mathematical thinking is grounded in real-world actions
(Lakoff & Núñez, 2001) like sharing an apple. The abilities
to search, find, pick the good one,	  and split it in two equal
parts are the roots of humans’ Number Sense (Dahaene,
1997). They include natural abilities to estimate the
magnitude of an object, apportion it and compare it –all
skills essential for fracturing. Figure 1 illustrates the
grounded metaphorical schemas of mathematical thinking
that contour the situatively embodied curriculum for M3:i1.

demonstrates how gestures as abstractions are still rooted in
relation to the body. Alibali and Nathan (2012) documented
gestures representing structure, orientation, action and
correspondence. For M3:i1, we hope the tactile gestural
interface of the tablet bridges action and conceptualization.
The gestures used in the current study come from Swart
et al., (2014) and are based on McNeills’ (1992) taxonomy.
Echoing Hostetter’s and Alibali’s (2008) Gestures as
Simulated Action, the tutor compares deictic gestures (i.e.,
pointing) that index the environment, to conceptual gestures
(metaphorical / enactive / symbolic) that embody simulated
actions for fractions (Fig. 3). Habgood and Ainsworth
(2011) reported better learning when there was an intrinsic
link between learning content and a game’s mechanics. We
hypothesize that conceptual gesturers that embody the
process of fractions will show better performance and
learning than deictic gestures.

Figure 1. Embodied Experiences of Mathematical Fractions
The tutor-game consists of 5 levels with 5 fractions each. In
Part 1, players use gestures to estimate, denominate and
numerate fractions by manipulating an enerchi bar (Fig. 2,
left), a hybrid of a rectangular area model and a number line
(Siegler et al., 2010). In Part 2, players determine
equivalence between the fractions by ordering them from
least to greatest along a horizontal axis, left to right, then
verifying their height vertically from bottom to top (Fig. 2).

Developing Gestural Mechanics. Gestures are integral
components of communication across languages and
cultures and species. They represent a robust a means for
educators to help learners reactivate (simulate) the
perceptual states associated with underlying concepts and
any strategies that elucidate understanding (GoldinMeadow, 1999). For example, Goldin-Meadow, Cook and
Mitchell (2009) demonstrated that a pairing gesture (i.e.,
two fingers to identify two numbers as a pairing) facilitated
elementary students strategies for arithmetic problems and

Developing Narrative. Developing an effective narrative
invests the audience in the continuity of the characters,
locations, objects, actions and themes and invests them into
the plot’s trajectory (Graesser, Singer & Trabasso, 1994).
The integration between the microstructure (details) and the
macrostructure (abstractions) is especially important when
building an interactive narrative. If the details are points of
entry to the concepts, then designers must situate players in
problem spaces that foster mental model constructions
(Johnson-Laird, 1980). Narrative has been shown to help
learners formulate coherent scripts into schemas and chunk
them into coherent mental models (Black, Turner & Bower,
1979). The players’ investment in the narrative will
hopefully motivate exploration of the problem space and
encourage practicing the procedures for creating and
comparing fractions along with opportunities for discovery
(Brown, Collins & Duguid, 1989).
Figure 4 shows the two narratives for comparison: (1) a
strong narrative based on the television series Cyberchase,
Fix the Climatron, in which we embark with Jackie to
Penguia to activate the HERObots by fracturing engerchi
bars and defeating the villain Hacker, or (2) weak narrative,

settings, story or explicit context. We characterize it as
“weak” in lieu of “no” narrative to account for researchers

determine equivalence between fractions as well as perform
arithmetic with fractions.

inability to control for students who might devise their own
internal narrative for the tutor-game. We hypothesize that a
strong narrative will improve student performance by
engaging students motivations and contextualizing the
process of fractioning better than a weak narrative.

Study 1 (M3:i1)
We devised, designed and developed the gestures,
narratives, curriculum, assets, instructions, feedback, and
scaffolding for the tutor-game. Four versions of Iteration-1
vary along two dimensions: (1) gestures (Conceptual vs.
Deictic) and (2) narrative (Strong vs. Weak), resulting in the
four conditions SC, SD, WC, and WD. Our research goal is
not just to determine if gesture and or narrative improve
learning, but “why” and “how” they do.

Methods
Participants.
Seventy-two students from grades 3 (n = 24), 4 (n=22) &
5 (n=26) grades (NTTL=72; x̄ AGE=10.31 years [1.64], 67%
female) at an afterschool program in Harlem, New York
City obtained parental consent and assented to participate in
the program.
Procedure.
Researchers formally tested a total of 72 students in a
specially designated classroom proctored by researchers and
after-school instructors. In a 2x2 factorial with repeated
measures, students were randomly assigned to play one of
the 4 tutor environments (SC, n=17), (SD, n=18), (WC
n=19), (WD, n=18). Each student completed a total of 3
one-hour sessions that included pre-tests, tutor play, posttests and exit surveys. Students were run in groups of 20
over the course of 3/4 days in a week (5 students per
condition) and the program extended over multiple weeks.
Portions of tutor play were video recorded, as were
students’ clinical interviews.

Exit-Survey: A written form administered to participants
upon completion of tutor play and testing. Items included
manipulation checks (narratives, gestures), comprehension
check, self-efficacy, motivation, engagement, persistence,
opinion/preferences and concept learning (15 items; 9 likert;
6 free response)
Clinical-Interview Script: Four multipart questions
designed to probe players thoughts on the tutor, the
narrative, impact of gesture and concept learning (4 items)
iPad Air & Sony MDR-ZX100 Headphones: Ten sets.
Flip Video UltraHD Camcorder: 2 camcorders w/ Tripods
for video recording tutor play and clinical interviews.

Results
Formal Assessments.
Initial pre-tests revealed no significant differences
between groups on any either the direct or transfer
assessments. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the
tutor-game overall is effective at improving learners
understanding of fractions with significant learning gains
across all conditions for both the direct assessment (F(1, 71) =
48.9, p<. 001, ηp2 = .408 as well as the transfer assessment
(F(1,71) = 57.51, p<. 001, ηp2 = .448). Moreover, a significant
positive correlation between the direct content and transfer
assessments (r = .774, n=38, p< .01) show a strong
relationship between the tutor content and more general
fractions concepts and principles.

Tutor-Game Data Log.

Materials

Tutor-game log data revealed significant effects of
gesture on tutor play. However, it is important to disclose
that the data sets suffered from an imbalance (i.e., number
of students per condition) due to a back-end programming
error that resulted in a stratified truncation of the data-log.
Thus, analysis of the following data sets was done using the
non-parametric tests Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon-W1 to
determine significant difference between independent
groups.

Direct Pre/Post Test: Parallel Forms A & B (12 items;
Cronbach’s α = .93) of fraction problems directly from the
tutor-game curriculum. Representations of fractions were
similar images used in the tutor, and activities included
estimation, denomination, numeration and determining
equivalence between fractions.

Estimation. Estimation error was lower for conceptual
gestures than for deictic users across strong and weak
narrative. Means for groups C and D were 23.04 and 24.1;
the distributions in the two groups differed significantly
(Mann–Whitney U = 248, Wilcoxon W= 477, nC =26, nD =
20, p < 0.08). A look at the raw means (Fig. 5) also reveals

For unit fractions, estimation errors were lower for
conceptual gestures than deictic gestures and approaching
significance, x̄ C = 23.04 and x̄ D = 24.1, Mann–Whitney U =
231, Wilcoxon W= 462, nC =21, nD = 29, p < 0.15. Figure
6 shows a similar trend towards interaction between
narrative and gesture.

Denomination.
Student performances denominating
wholes into parts were significantly more accurate for
conceptual gestures than for deictic gestures. For levels 1 –
3, students using conceptual gestures denominated (i.e.,
correct number of divisions) with significantly less error
than students using deictic gestures x̄ C = 18.66 and x̄ D =
25.24, Mann–Whitney U = 164.5, Wilcoxon W= 345.5, nC
=19, nD = 25, p < 0.10.
Figure 8 graphs the number of denominations students
made in error (i.e., 3 slices of the bar, 4 parts, for a
denominator of 3). Visible is the recurring trend for a
significant interaction between gesture and narrative.
Students were also significantly more accurate
denominating unit fractions using conceptual gestures than
deictic gestures; x̄ C = 17.95 and x̄ D = 30.97, Mann–Whitney
U = 146, Wilcoxon W= 377, nC =21, nD = 29, p< 0. 01.

Figure 7 shows error rates for estimation (averaged by
group) across the entire curriculum (Levels 1 – 5) spike for
the fractions (3/3) and (10/10) across the curriculum. Error
rates were also higher for fractions (4/5) and (7/8). Looking
at trends in the data help pinpoint aspects of the tutor worth
further investigation. The increased error rate on these
problems could signify content difficulty, usability or
conceptual development.

Denomination Scaffolding.
After 3 attempts to
denominate the bar into equal parts, students received
automated scaffolding that provided dashed-lines for them
to either slice (conceptual) or tap (deictic). For levels 1-3,
students using conceptual gestures required significantly
less scaffolding (i.e., the tutor-game presented an interactive
solution to the user after 3 unsuccessful attempts at
denomination) than students using deictic gestures; means

Similarly, for unit fractions, students used less
scaffolding (i.e., the tutor-game presented an interactive
solution to the user after 3 unsuccessful attempts at
denomination) than students using deictic gestures; means
for groups x̄ C = 21.76 and x̄ D = 28.21; Mann–Whitney U =

deictic and conceptual gestures in their explanations, this
crossover was not symmetrical, that is, no students from the
conceptual gesture condition employed any deictic gestures
in their explanations of fractions. We discuss how these
findings might qualify the empirical evidence that supports
the usage of conceptual gestures for learning.

Discussion

Interview Data.
Motivation Survey Likert Items. 5-point likert scale items
found strong indications that students across all conditions
were highly motivated to play (x̄M = 4.62 [.72], enjoyed
playing (x̄E = 4.59 [.67]) and would persist in playing more
levels (x̄P = 4.62 [.70]). Student’s indicated that they liked
learning math on the iPad (x̄LM = 4.44 [1.00]) even though
they found the game moderately difficult (x̄D = 3.79 [1.11])
with a significant medium sized correlation (r = .442, N=71,
p < .01). Also interesting is the significant moderate
correlation between students’ self-efficacy judgments (x̄SF =
3.90 [.94]) and difficulty (r = .422, N =71, p < .01).
Clinical Interviews. Clinical interviews found students
gesturing during their explanations of fractions. Figures 911 are comparing gestures made by students from
conditions SC, SD, WD. Each figure overlays multiple

The empirical evidence supports our hypothesis that
conceptual gestures (Segal, Tversky, Black, 2014) help
students perform better at estimating and denominating
fractions than deictic gestures. This is not surprising since
both estimation and denomination conceptually are
grounded in the continuous processes of measurement
(Siegler, Thompson and Schneider, 2011) and the deictic
gestures are both static and more abstract. The larger
question is whether or not students’ accurate performances
are actually transforming into to a more robust conceptual
understanding?
Although deictic gestures can metaphorically represent
both the indexing of an object or the enacting of a procedure
(Kang, Tversky & Black, 2015), students from the deictic
condition consistently employed both deictic and conceptual
gestures in their explanations. If we take their gestures as
indicators of their implicit knowledge or mental models of
fractioning (Broaders, Cook, Mitchell & Goldin-Meadow,
2007), their interviews suggest that the natural
conceptualizations of the fracturing process is an embodied
one, hence students produce gestures that are enactive and
metaphorical. For cognitive scientist interested in learning,
this supports the existing research demonstrating the
influence and efficacy of using gesture in pedagogy
(Goldin-Meadow, et al., 2009; Alibali et al, 2012).
For narrative, empirical evidence revealed no significant
impact of adding settings, characters or plot to the gametutor. That few students integrated any elements of the
strong narrative into their survey responses or clinical
interview explanations of fractions suggests a few
possibilities: (1) the narrative was not strong enough to
invest users, (2) it could be a seductive detail (Harp &
Mayer, 1998), (3) it may interact with gesture and users
such that its effectiveness differentiates between users and
conditions and requires more study.
Nonetheless, the
possibility also exists that situating the tasks for
constructing fractions into a scaffolded interactive digital
environment with feedback was equally impactful for all
students (Lesh, 1985; Barab et al., 2007), thus the digital
tablet itself outweighed any further impact of
contextualizing fractions into a narrative arc.
In M3:i2, researchers hope to re-design the narrative,
gestures and scaffolds in order to address these issues and
clarify their impacts on conceptualization of fractions.
