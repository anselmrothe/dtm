Abstract
The effect of face inversion has been heavily studied, whereas
fewer studies have investigated inversion in scenes. We
investigated the influence of scene inversion on decisions and
contextual guidance of eye movements during visual search.
A saccade contingent display termination paradigm was used
to assess the temporal dynamics of the effect. Observers
searched for a computer mouse in office scenes and
performed a yes/no detection task. Observers’ sensitivity (d’)
was lower for inverted images relative to upright. Observers’
false positive rate decreased with additional eye movements
when they viewed upright images, but remained constant
during the first three eye movements when viewing inverted
images. The average distance of observers’ eye movements to
the target location was greater for inverted than upright
scenes. We interpret that inverting an image disrupts the rapid
extraction of scene gist, subsequently disrupting guidance in
eye movement behavior and slowing the process of rejecting
false positives.

Introduction
A complete effort to investigate human scene understanding
should include assessment of the effects of impoverished
scene information on behavior. Such endeavors help us
identify the processes that contribute to scene
understanding, and the conditions in which they break
down. Given our lack of experience in navigating an upsidedown world, one such instance of impoverished information
arises when scenes are inverted. Compared to the amount of
work dedicated to understanding the effects of face
inversion (Farah, Tanaka, & Drain, 1995; Valentine, 1988;
Yovel & Kanwisher, 2005), scene inversion has been
relatively less studied. Identifying the resulting impact of
scene inversion may allow us to draw conclusions about
what processes mediate scene understanding, in the same
way that face inversion research has served as evidence for
holistic processing of faces (Tanaka & Farah, 1993) and as
evidence for (Kanwisher, Tong, & Nakayama, 1998) and
against (G. A. Rousselet, Macé, & Fabre-Thorpe, 2003) a
dedicated face perception module in the brain.

Existing work using inverted scenes has heavily focused
on change blindness (Kelley, Chun, & Chua, 2003; Shore &
Klein, 2000) and generally assumed that inversion affects
the extraction of meaning or context from a scene
(Brockmole & Henderson, 2006; Kelley et al., 2003) based
on evidence of the perceptual deficits caused by orientation
changes of stimuli (Klein, 1982; Rock, 1974). Other work
has similarly shown the negative impact of scene inversion
on the categorization of scene type (Walther, Caddigan, FeiFei, & Beck, 2009), a result that suggests scene gist may be
affected by inversion.
There has been less work assessing the effects of scene
inversion on decisions and eye movements during search. In
particular, scene gist, context, and information about objects
that co-occur with a target are rapidly extracted (Greene &
Oliva, 2009; Henderson & Hollingworth, 1999; G.
Rousselet, Joubert, & Fabre-Thorpe, 2005), guide eye
movements (Castelhano & Heaven, 2011; Eckstein,
Drescher, & Shimozaki, 2006; Mack & Eckstein, 2011;
Neider & Zelinsky, 2006; Oliva & Torralba, 2007; Preston,
Guo, Das, Giesbrecht, & Eckstein, 2013; Torralba, Oliva,
Castelhano, & Henderson, 2006) and facilitate behavioral
decisions (Castelhano & Heaven, 2011; Eckstein et al.,
2006; Mack & Eckstein, 2011; Neider & Zelinsky, 2006).
The current work focused on understanding the effect of
scene inversion on behavioral performance and eye
movement guidance during a visual search task. We
assessed how this effect unfolds temporally by utilizing a
viewing paradigm that terminates scene presentation based
on the number of saccadic eye movements executed by the
observer. This paradigm is similar to that used by Hsiao and
Cottrell (2008) to investigate the number of fixations
required to recognize a face. We are particularly interested
in how scene inversion disrupts the extraction of scene
context and guidance of eye movements. By including trials
in which there was no target present, but that contained
scene cues (i.e., other objects predictive of the target
location), we were able to evaluate the effect of scene
inversion on eye movement guidance by scene context in
isolation from guidance by target information.

Methods
Participants
Eye-tracking and behavioral response data were collected
from 48 undergraduates (ages 18-23) at the University of
California, Santa Barbara with normal or corrected-tonormal vision who received course credit for participation.
Informed written consent was collected from all
participants.

Stimuli and Design
A total of 80 greyscale photos of office and home-office
scenes were shown to each participant. Image sizes varied in
height from 12.9° to 23.7° and width from 13° to 24.7°. Half
of the images contained a computer mouse, used as the
target for the search task, and half did not. Images contained
a computer monitor or laptop in both mouse present and
absent images. Sample images are shown in Figure 1.
Latin-square counterbalancing was used to assign
participants to conditions, thus determining whether a given
image would be shown to the participant upright or inverted
and how many fixations they would be allotted during
image viewing. The experiment was therefore a 2 (image
orientation; upright or inverted) × 4 (fixation allowance; 1,
2, or 3 fixations, or 3 second allowance) repeated measures
design. Presentation of conditions was not blocked, i.e., the
order of image presentation was randomized.

Apparatus
Stimuli were displayed on a 1024 × 768 pixel resolution
LCD Barco MDRC-1119 monitor, calibrated to native
settings, with each pixel subtending 0.037° of visual angle.
Eye tracking data were recorded using a tower-mounted
Eyelink 1000 system (SR Research Ltd., Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada) monitoring gaze position at 250 Hz.
Fixations were calibrated and validated using a nine-point
grid system. Initial fixation was controlled on every trial and
monitored to ensure error never exceeded greater than 1°.

Recalibration was performed in the case of large head or
body movements. Saccades were classified as events where
eye velocity was greater than 22°/s and eye acceleration
exceeded 4000°/s2.

Procedure
Observers were instructed to determine whether a computer
mouse was present in a series of images. They were to make
a simple yes/no decision, and were told there was a 50%
likelihood of target presence in each image. On each trial,
observers began with an initial fixation outside of the
boundaries of where the image was to appear, 1° above the
bottom of the screen and 1.4° to 6° degrees from the border
of the image, centered horizontally. Once observers initiated
a trial with a key press, they were required to maintain
initial fixation for 500-1500 msec before the image would
appear. They were told that the image would appear for a
variable amount of time, during which they could search for
the mouse. Once a fixation was made inside of the image
boundaries on the screen, the image was removed after one,
two, or three fixations or a time limit of three seconds.
Participants were naïve to the specifics of the fixationdependent termination and a post-experiment questionnaire
confirmed that they did not infer the experimental
manipulation. Following image termination, two buttons
were displayed, and the observer used the computer mouse
to select whether they believed the target was present or
absent. Feedback was not provided.
Participants were not informed that display termination
was contingent upon their eye movements, but were simply
told that the stimulus would appear for a variable amount of
time. A debriefing questionnaire confirmed that all
participants remained naïve to this manipulation, but trial
conditions were randomized during the experiment to
ensure that participants could not anticipate whether an
image would appear upright or inverted and how long they
would have to view the image.

image shown upright (a) and inverted (b), as well as a target present image shown upright (c) and inverted (d). Red dots
indicate the expected or actual target location. Examples (b) and (d) were presented inverted to participants, but are
shown upright here for ease of comparison.

Data Analysis
Behavioral Performance For each of the image orientation
conditions (inverted or upright) and fixation allowances we
calculated the proportion of target present trials in which the
observers correctly detected the target (hit rate) and the
proportion of target absent trials in which the observers
incorrectly reported the target to be present (false alarm
rate). Hit rate and false alarm rate were analyzed with a 2
(inverted or upright) × 4 (fixation allowance) repeated
measures ANOVA. The hit rates and false alarm rates were
transformed to standard signal detection measures of
criterion (c) and sensitivity, d’ (Green & Swets, 1989) and
standard errors were calculated using bootstrap resample
methods (Efron, 1979). We calculated the criterion and
sensitivity differences between the upright and inverted
conditions for each of the 10,000 individual bootstrap
resamples across each fixation allowance. We then
calculated the proportion of criterion/sensitivity differences
above or below zero to estimate the probability of observing
differences larger/smaller than zero.

Signal detection analysis allows us to separate effects on
sensitivity or target detectability (d’) from propensity to
make a “target present” decision (criterion). Results (Figure
2c) show higher sensitivity at detecting the target when the
scenes were upright than when they were inverted (p <
0.02). In addition, not surprisingly, sensitivity increases
with longer exploration (p < 0.001).
Arguably more surprising but consistent with the false
alarm rate are the results related to the criterion (Figure 2d).
As scene exploration unfolds, observers’ criterion for
upright scenes increases steadily, whereas criterion for
inverted scenes stays relatively constant throughout the first
three fixations. With up to three seconds to explore the
scene, the difference between upright and inverted criteria
did not reach significance (p=0.1) Also, interestingly, for
observers’ first fixation there is a trend for a lower criterion
for upright images than for inverted images (p < 0.06).

Fixation Analysis To assess the guidance of eye
movements, we calculated the average distance of each
fixation from the target in the target present trials. The
mode of the coordinate locations of the expected target
location reported by five independent observers was used
as the expected target location to compute distance
measures on target absent trials. The results of this analysis
were analyzed with a 2 (inverted or upright) ×	   6 (fixation
number) × 2 (target present or absent) three-way repeated
measures ANOVA.

Results
Behavioral Responses
Figure 2a presents observers’ hit rates as a function of their
fixation allowance. Observers’ hit rates increased
significantly with increasing number of fixations (F(3,141)
= 53.38, p < 0.001) but were significantly lower for inverted
than upright images (F(1,47) = 71.80, p < 0.001). When
observers were allotted three seconds to search the image,
the difference between their hit rates on upright and inverted
images did not reach significance.
Figure 2b shows that the false alarm rate for the upright
condition decreases with increasing number of fixations ( p
< 0.05 for all pairwise comparisons except the difference
between two and three allowed fixations). In contrast, for
the inverted scene condition the reduction in false alarm rate
is only present in the three second presentation with more
than four fixations (t(47) = 3.648, p = 0.001). Across the
first three fixations there was no reduction in false alarm
rate for the inverted scene condition (p > 0.05 for all
pairwise comparisons). In addition, for the first fixation
there is a trend for a higher false alarm rate for the upright
scenes than the inverted scenes (t(47) = 1.423, p = 0.161).

and criterion (d) as a function of fixation allowance for
upright and inverted images.

Eye Movement Analyses
Fixation analyses show a significant effect of inversion on
the ability of the observers to fixate the target or expected
target location. Figure 3 (black lines) shows the average
distance of each fixation to the target location for inverted
and upright scenes for target present trials. Distance
measures were averaged across fixation allowance
conditions after verifying that the experimental
manipulation of display termination did not influence
distances to target location of preceding fixations.
The first fixation shown in Figure 3 is the landing point of
the first saccade into the image from the forced initial
fixation outside of the image. The second fixation shown in
Figure 3, which is the landing point of the first saccade
within the image, is the first fixation counted toward the
allowance on every trial. Therefore, at least two fixations

1143

were recorded for every observer on every trial (except on a
small percentage of erroneous trials due to tracker or
observer error). More generally, on a trial where n fixations
were allowed, n+1 fixations within the image will be
recorded.
On target absent trials, we computed the average distance
of each fixation to the expected target location (Figure 3,
grey lines) estimated by the selections of five separate
observers that did not participate in the search task.
Fixations are significantly closer to target locations for
upright scenes than inverted scenes in both target present
and absent images (F(1,47) = 263.98, p<0.001).
Representative examples of observer fixations are shown in
Figure 1. The increase in average distance to target location
on the fourth, fifth, and sixth fixations for upright, target
present trials likely occurs due to exploratory eye
movements made after target localization in the 3 second
viewing time condition.

Figure 3: Average distance of fixations to target (during
target present trials) or expected target location (during
target absent trials) for upright and inverted images. It is
important to note that increasingly fewer fixations are
included in the averages for later fixations due to the
fixation allowance manipulation.

Discussion
The objective of the current paper was to investigate the
influence of scene inversion on search decisions and eye
movements. The first result is that scene inversion reduces
observers’ sensitivity (d’) to detect a target. This reduction
in detectability could be solely attributed to an increased
difficulty to detect an inverted target in both the fovea and
visual periphery. However, the disruption of eye movement
guidance toward expected target locations with scene
inversion suggests that the reduction in target detectability is
also partly due to an inability to rapidly extract scene
context and foveate potential target locations.
Arguably the more interesting finding is the influence on
observers’ decision criterion. Our results display a

marginally lower criterion (see Figure 2d, p < 0.06)
following the first fixation when the image was upright than
when it was inverted. As scene exploration evolves through
the first three saccades, the false alarm rate decreases
significantly when the scene is upright but not when it is
inverted. In addition, the analysis of the fixations in target
absent images shows that the eye movements in the upright
scene condition are more guided toward expected target
locations. Taken together we interpret these results as
suggesting that observers fixate likely target locations in a
scene and as they reject individual likely target locations
they become less likely to make a target present judgment
when the target is not there. When the scene is inverted,
rapid extraction of scene context is disrupted, preventing
typical guidance of eye movements toward likely target
locations, thereby delaying the process of rejecting
candidate target locations and the lowering of the decision
criterion.
A possible explanation for the marginally lower criterion
on the first fixation is the role of rapid scene gist extraction
(Greene & Oliva, 2009; Henderson & Hollingworth, 1999;
Rousselet et al., 2005) in setting the initial decision
criterion. This explanation is consistent with the finding by
Hillstrom et al. (2012) that after a 250 ms preview of a
scene, only the first two eye movements during
unconstrained scene search are influenced by gist
information. When observers are first presented with the
image, they recognize the office space as a likely scene to
contain a target mouse and lower their decision criterion. In
this interpretation, scene inversion would disrupt the rapid
extraction of scene gist and not automatically lower the
criterion. This automatic adjustment of decision criterion
based on scene gist extraction would be a useful strategy if
the observer is presented with images from different
categories (e.g., office space, jungle, beach, etc.) and lowers
their criterion for scenes semantically related to the given
target.
Our discussion has emphasized the use of scene context to
guide eye movements and lower the decision criterion but it
is possible that the process of false alarm rate reduction
might also occur in the absence of eye movements though
processes of covert attention to the visual periphery
(Ludwig, Davies, & Eckstein, 2014; Posner, Snyder, &
Davidson, 1980).
Additionally, we have used the term scene context
broadly but it is possible that various different types of cues
are guiding eye movements and are disrupted when the
scene is inverted. Scene gist (Torralba et al., 2006), as
discussed, is one commonly investigated example that may
cue attention. Co-occurring objects, in this case the
computer monitor, keyboard, or desk, can also serve as
useful indicators of target location (Castelhano & Heaven,
2011; Eckstein et al., 2006; Mack & Eckstein, 2011).
Finally, viewing time is not equated across the levels of
the fixation allowance and could partially explain the
increased sensitivity with increased number of allowed
saccades, although the target object (a computer mouse) is

1144

difficult to detect in the visual periphery suggesting that eye
movements are likely important in the increase in target
detectability.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that inverting a
scene increases the likelihood that participants will falsely
detect a target object, thus lowering their decision criterion
as compared to that of upright scenes, likely due to the
disruption of the extraction of scene gist. These results, as
well as future results derived from the manipulation of
scene orientation, are useful for constructing critical tests of
scene understanding mechanisms, and for understanding
their influences during the scene exploration process.
