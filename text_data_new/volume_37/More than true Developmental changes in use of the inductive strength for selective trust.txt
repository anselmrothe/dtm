Abstract
When learning from others, it is important to take a
critical stance—evaluating both the informants themselves
as well as the content of their claims. In addition to
accuracy, one can evaluate claims based on quality. The
current study investigates developmental change in learners’
evaluations of evidence that varies in quality—inductive
strength based on typicality or diversity. We found that
while younger children track which informant provides
which examples, they do not have clear preferences for the
informant who provides stronger examples. Older children,
on the other hand, are in the middle of a developmental
transition. They rate informants who provide inductively
strong examples as more trustworthy, but only reliably
choose the informant who provides diverse examples.

Introduction
Much of what we know we learn from other people.
Although learning from others is often an efficient means of
gathering information (e.g., Csibra & Gergely, 2009), it is
not
infallible.
Depending
on
an
informant’s
knowledgeability and intentions, information presented by
an informant may vary from accurate and helpful to
inaccurate or even misleading. Thus, it is important for
learners to consider an informant’s trustworthiness when
drawing inferences from examples he or she has chosen
(Landrum, Eaves, & Shafto, 2015; see also Sperber et al.,
2010).
Research has demonstrated that learners as young as 4years-old engage in this reciprocal process of trusting to
learn and learning to trust. For instance, Koenig & Harris
(2005) show that preschoolers track whether informants
provide accurate labels for a series of common objects (e.g.,
“ball”, “cup”), and later use this information to determine
which of those informants to trust for providing labels for
novel, unfamiliar objects (e.g, “wug”, “loma”). In this
paradigm, children are leveraging their prior knowledge of
known object labels to learn whom to trust for new

information. Having inferred that this informant is
trustworthy, children will trust the informant to continue to
provide accurate labels, even when the children are no
longer able to confirm that this is the case (e.g., when the
informant is labeling unfamiliar objects).
A major difficulty in real-life learning situations,
however, is that information presented by informants is
rarely as clearly right or wrong as in these labeling
paradigms. In fact, information presented by informants can
be accurate but misleading, causing learners to hold false
beliefs. For instance, if a teacher demonstrates only one
function of a multifunction toy, leaners could draw the
conclusion that there is only one function (see Bonawitz,
Shafto et al., 2011). Work by Gweon and colleagues, for
example, demonstrates that even 6- and 7-year-old children
recognize that informants must not only be correct but also
provide an appropriate quantity of information. In the study,
children rated under-informative teachers (i.e., teachers who
demonstrated only 1 function of a 4-function toy) lower
than informative teachers (i.e., teachers who demonstrated 1
function of a 1-function toy). In addition, the study showed
that children compensated for under-informative teachers by
exploring a new toy more broadly (Gweon, Pelton,
Konopka, & Schulz, 2014). Empirical and modeling work
with undergraduates shows that learners are willing to trust
informants who omit some information, as long as the
informants have provided enough information to support
accurate inference (e.g., Shafto, Gweon, Fargen, & Schulz,
2012).
Building on this, it is also possible that learners consider
the quality of information—such as the typicality or
diversity of examples—when determining if informants are
trustworthy. Voluminous research shows that children as
young as 4 and 5 are sensitive to the quality of information
when making inductive generalizations (e.g., Bjorklund,
Thompson, & Ornstein, 1983; Gelman & Markman, 1986;
Heit, 2000; Heit & Hahn, 2001; Osherson, Smith, Wilkie,
Lopez & Shafir, 1990). Thus, it is possible that learners may
be able to leverage these inductive abilities to infer
informant credibility, even when informants provide neither

1249

incorrect nor differing quantities of information. The current
study aims to address this question.
In order to evaluate informant trustworthiness based on
sample quality, a learner has to be able to differentiate
between sets of examples based on inductive strength. Prior
work by Rhodes, Brickman, and Gelman (2008)
demonstrated a developmental shift in the ability to choose
between samples varying in quality. In their study,
participants were presented with a diverse and a non-diverse
set of examples and were asked which of the two sets they
would prefer to use to learn about a domain. Depending on
condition, the diverse and non-diverse example sets either
both included all typical or all atypical instances (i.e., alltypical and all-atypical conditions) or one included typical
instances while the other included atypical instances (i.e.,
diverse-typical condition and diverse-atypical condition).
Notably, children were not told about the origin of the
examples, and therefore only evaluated sample
composition—not informants. The authors found that
whereas adults chose the diverse sample set across all
conditions, 6-year-olds generally chose the sample set
containing typical instances, and 9-year-olds chose the
diverse samples more in the all-typical or all-atypical
conditions than they did in the other two conditions. The
authors suggest that children appreciate premise typicality at
a young age, but the ability to recognize the benefit of
diversity does not develop until later.

Current Study
The current study examines developmental variation in the
use of example quality for evaluating informants. In the
study, participants were presented with a situation in which
they were interested in answering anatomical questions
about several animal categories. In order to learn about
these animals, they could examine example animals from
the categories to study, similar to Rhodes et al. (2008).
However the current study differs from Rhodes et al. (2008)
in two important ways. First, the current study presents the
examples as being selected by informants. Thus, whereas
the Rhodes et al. (2008) study was focused on the
composition of samples, the current study additionally
investigated inferences that are made about informants.
Following standard methods in the selective trust literature,
participants were first asked whose examples they endorse
and were then asked which informant they would prefer to
ask to help them solve a new problem. The endorse trials
provide a close analog to the methods of Rhodes et al.;
participants were asked to choose between one set of
examples and the other. The ask trials, in contrast, provide
insight about how participants evaluate informants;
participants were asked which of the two informants to ask
without having provided examples to evaluate. We also
assess participants’ explicit perceptions of informant
trustworthiness by asking them to rate each informant’s
knowledgeability and helpfulness. Prior empirical and
modeling work suggests these are the two important
dimensions of trustworthiness (e.g., Shafto, Eaves, Navarro,

& Perfors, 2012). We average these two ratings together to
get an estimate of perceived trustworthiness.
Second, we differ from Rhodes et al. (2008) in the way
that typicality and diversity were presented. Whereas the
Rhodes et al. study crossed the two factors, we isolated
typicality and diversity, allowing us to investigate their
development independently and in a format closer to prior
work in the inductive generalization literature.
Our study had two goals. First, we aimed to investigate
potential developmental changes in the ability to use
example typicality and diversity for (a) choosing between
informant claims and (b) trusting informants for new
information. Second, we aimed to determine whether the
provision of typical and diverse examples leads to
informants being explicitly perceived as more trustworthy.

Method
Participants
Child-aged participants were recruited and tested at the
Kentucky Science Center. Children were randomly assigned
to participate in one of the two conditions: the typical
condition or the diverse condition. Because we collected
data from a wide age range, we divided the participants
within each condition using a median split into younger
children and older children. In the typical condition, 42
children participated: 21 younger children (Mage=6.47 years,
SD=1.39) and 21 older children (Mage=10.93 years,
SD=2.22). In the diverse condition, 46 children participated:
23 younger children (Mage=5.35 years, SD=1.29) and 23
older children (Mage=10.03 years, SD=1.83). In addition, 40
adults were tested via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
and were each paid 50 cents for participation.

Procedure
As stated above, participants were randomly assigned to one
of two between-subjects condition: the typical condition or
the diverse condition. For both conditions, the experiment
consisted of three sections: the endorse trials, the ask trials,
and the explicit rating items, and was completed on a tablet
computer using Qualtrics survey software. To begin,
participants were introduced to the following prompt:
We are going to pretend that you are a scientist who is
trying to learn about the insides of some animals. In
order to learn these things, you need to pick good
example animals to look at and learn about. Two people
have agreed to help pick out example animals for you.
For each question, your job is to decide who picked out
the example animals that will help you learn best1.

Following the prompt, the participants completed the
three sections of the experiment. The first section consisted
of four endorse trials. For each trial, each informant
presented a set of examples which participants were asked
to choose between. In the typical condition, one informant

presented a typical example (i.e., the typical informant) and
the other informant presented an atypical example (i.e., the
atypical informant). For the category DOG, for instance, the
typical informant selected a yellow labrador retriever, and
the atypical informant selected a Chinese crested (see Figure
1). In the diverse condition, one informant presented diverse
examples (i.e., the diverse informant) and the other
informant provided non-diverse examples (i.e., non-diverse
informant). For the category DOG, for instance, the diverse
informant selected three different dog breeds, and the nondiverse informant selected three instances of one dog breed
(see Figure 1). The order of the four endorse items was
randomized between participants using the survey’s item
randomizing function. Which informant appeared on the
right or left side of the screen (and which informant image
was red or blue) was counterbalanced between participants.
To help participants track the informants, the informants
appeared on the same side of the screen for a given
participant for the duration of the experiment. For the
endorsement trials, we measured how many times
participants endorsed the examples provided by the typical
or diverse informant out of the four trials (i.e., number of
endorsements).

check questions correctly (5 were in the diverse condition).
Again, as participants were reminded which informants
provided which examples after answering the check
questions, no participants were excluded from the analyses.
The second section of the experiment consisted of four
ask trials in which participants needed to determine whom
to ask for new example animals. For instance, participants
were told, “Now you want to know if pigs have something
inside called kervicas. Who do you want to ask for example
pigs?” For these items, participants only saw the informant
image (with no examples). The order of the four ask items
was randomized between participants. The number of times
the participants requested examples from the typical/diverse
informant (i.e., number of requests) was measured. Note
that participants did not receive any information from the
informants during these trials.
The third and final section of the experiment asked
participants to rate both informants on the two dimensions
of trustworthiness: knowledgeability and helpfulness. For
the knowledge rating items, participants were asked to rate
each informant on a sliding scale from 0 to 10 (allowing for
two decimals) how much they think each informant knows
about animal insides (i.e., animal anatomy). For the
helpfulness rating items, participants were asked to rate each
informant on a sliding scale from 0 to 10 (allowing for two
decimals) how helpful they thought each person’s examples
were. The order of the two rating items (knowledge and
helpfulness) was randomized between participants, as was
which informant they rated first (i.e., the typical/diverse
informant or the atypical/non-diverse informant). The
knowledgeability and helpfulness ratings for each informant
were averaged together to create a trustworthiness rating
score.
At the end of the experiment, children were awarded a
certificate and a small toy.

(diverse/typical or non-diverse/atypical) was randomized

provided with feedback to whether they were correct or
incorrect and then were shown the examples provided by
each informant as a reminder. In general, participants had
little difficulty with the check items: 61% of younger
children and 93% of older children got both check questions
correct and 25% of younger children and 6% of older
children got one right. Only 6 younger children answered no

We began by investigating developmental variation in the
use of example typicality. In addition, we examined whether
there were differences between participants’ responses to
the endorse items and the ask items. Then, we investigated
whether participants in each age group preferred the typical
informant by comparing their selections of the typical
informant to chance. Finally, to determine whether
participants of each age group saw the two informants as
varying in trustworthiness, we examined the participant’s
trustworthiness rating scores of the two informants.
Developmental variation in the use of example typicality
for endorsing and asking informants. First, to investigate
developmental variation in the use of example typicality for
endorsing and asking informants, we conducted a mixeddesign ANOVA with item-type (endorse, ask) as a withinsubjects factor and age group (younger children, older
children, adults) as a between-subjects factor. We found a

1251

main effect of item-type: participants generally endorsed
(M=3.03, SD=0.92) the typical informant’s examples more
often than they asked (M=2.63, SD=1.19) him for new
examples, F(1, 59)=7.74, p=.007, η2=.116. This effect did
not differ significantly by age (no item type by age group
interaction), F(2, 59)=0.42, p=.66, η2=.014. However, posthoc comparisons of endorsing versus asking for each age
group show that the difference between endorsing and
asking was only significant for the youngest age group
(Mendorse=2.81, SD=0.93, Mask=2.24, SD=1.09, p=.036,
d=.56). See Figure 2.

informant (typical, atypical) was a within-subjects variable
and age group was a between-subjects variable. Importantly,
we found a main effect of informant, such that participants
rated the typical informant as more trustworthy (M=7.38,
SD=2.22) than the atypical informant (M=5.58, SD=2.46),
F(1, 59)=14.72, p<.001, η2=.20. This effect did not vary by
age (no informant by age group interaction), F(2, 59)=1.65,
p=.202, η2=.053. That said, post-hoc comparisons of the
ratings for the typical and atypical informants for each age
group show that this difference is significant for older
children and adults, but not for the youngest age group
(Younger: t(20)=0.61, p=.550, d=0.24; Older: t(20)=3.08,
p=.006, d=0.92: Adult: t(19)=4.14, p=.001, d=1.41). See
Figure 3.

Asterisks denotes differences between endorse and ask
items. *p<.05
The ANOVA also revealed a developmental change in the
use of example typicality, collapsed across item type (i.e.,
main effect of age group), F(2, 59)=7.80, p=.001, η2=.209.
Bonferroni corrected follow-up tests show that adults
(Madults=3.43, SD=0.89) selected the typical informant more
frequently than both younger children (Myounger=2.52,
SD=0.83, p=.002, d=1.09) and older children (Molder=2.57,
SD=0.73, p=.004, d=1.09). Younger and older children did
not vary significantly from one another (p=1.00, d=0.07).
Preferences for the typical informant. Comparing
participants’ preferences for the typical informant to chance,
we find that all age groups endorsed the typical informant
above chance levels (Younger: M=2.81, SD=0.93,
t(20)=4.00, p=.001, d=1.79; Older: M=2.76, SD=0.94,
t(20)=3.7, p=.001, d=1.65; Adult: M=3.55, SD=0.69,
t(20)=10.10, p<.001, d=4.59). In contrast, only adults asked
the typical informant above chance levels, while older
children trended towards doing so (Younger: M=2.23,
SD=1.09, t(20)=1.00, p=.329, d=0.45; Older: M=2.38,
SD=0.92, t(20)=1.90, p=.072, d=0.85; Adult: M=3.30,
SD=1.30, t(19)=4.47, p<.001, d=2.05).
Developmental variation in trustworthiness ratings.
Next, to examine developmental differences in participants’
ratings of informant trustworthiness, we conducted an
ANOVA on informant trustworthiness rating scores where

Atypical informants shown. Asterisks denote differences in
perceived trustworthiness between the two informants.
**p<.01, ***p<.001.
The ANOVA also revealed an overall main effect of age,
F(2, 59)=3.87, p=.026, η2=.116. Bonferroni-corrected posthoc t-tests show that adults (Madults=7.16, SD=1.19) gave the
informants higher ratings than younger children
(Myounger=6.07, SD=2.60, p=.039, d=0.55) and trended
towards doing so compared to older children (Molder=6.21,
SD=1.71, p=.087, d=0.66). Younger children’s and older
children’s ratings did not differ from one another
significantly (p=1.00, d=0.07).
Summary. We find developmental variation in the use of
example typicality for making inferences about informants.
While even the youngest children are able to endorse typical
versus atypical examples provided by informants, there
were differences in whether participants used this
information to determine whom to request future examples
from. Adults preferred to request for examples from an
informant who had previously provided typical examples,
and older children trended towards doing so. Younger
children, however, showed no preference. These findings
were supported in the trustworthiness ratings data; older
children and adults saw the typical informant as more

1252

trustworthy than the atypical informant, but younger
children did not.

Example Diversity
The analysis for the diverse condition was the same as the
analysis for the typical condition except where otherwise
noted.
Developmental variation in the use of example diversity
for endorsing and asking informants. Unlike for example
typicality, there was no main effect of item type;
participants did not endorse (M=2.92, SD=1.13) the diverse
informant more often than they asked (M=2.91, SD=1.12)
that informant, F(1, 64)=0.02, p=.093, η2<.001. Also, there
was not an age by item interaction, F(2, 64)=1.41, p=.252,
η2=.042. There was, however, a main effect of age,
F(2, 64)=23.94, p<.001, η2=.428. Bonferroni-corrected
comparisons show that adults (Madult=3.79, SD=0.46)
selected the diverse informant more often than both younger
(Myounger=2.22, SD=0.39, p<.001, d=3.78) and older children
(Molder=2.74, SD=1.16, p<.001, d=1.20). See Figure 4.

(typical, atypical) was a within-subjects variable and age
group was a between-subjects variable. Importantly, like
with the typical condition, we found a main effect of
informant, such that participants rated the diverse informant
as more trustworthy (M=7.68, SD=2.13) than the nondiverse informant (M=4.97, SD=2.63), F(1, 64)=37.15,
p<.001, η2=.367. Unlike the typical condition, however, this
effect did vary by age, F(2, 64)=6.34, p=.003, η2=.165.
Bonferroni-corrected comparisons suggest that the
difference between the trustworthiness ratings for the two
informants was smaller for the younger children
(MDyounger=0.51) than for both older children (MDolder=4.00,
p=.005) and adults (MDadult=3.62, p=.018). Older children’s
and adults’ ratings did not differ significantly from one
another (p=1.00). Moreover, older children and adults saw
the diverse informant as significantly more trustworthy than
the non-diverse informant, but younger children did not
(Younger: t(22)=0.55, p=.586, d=0.19; Older: t(22)=5.539,
p<.001, d=1.90; Adult: t(20)=5.88, p<.001, d=1.73). See
Figure 5.

perceived trustworthiness between the two informants.
***p<.001.

Figure 4. Participants’ selection of the diverse informant.
Preferences for the diverse informant. Comparing
participants’ preferences for the diverse informant to
chance, we find that only older children and adults endorsed
the diverse informant above chance levels (Younger:
M=2.08, SD=0.79, t(22)=0.53, p=.604, d=.22; Older:
M=2.87, SD=1.25, t(22)=3.33, p=.003, d=1.42; Adult:
M=3.80, SD=0.40, t(20)=20.61, p<.001, d=9.22). Similarly,
older children and adults asked the diverse informant above
chance levels, and the younger children trended towards
doing so (Younger: M=2.35, SD=0.89, t(22)=1.89, p=.073,
d=.80; Older: M=2.61, SD=1.20, t(22)=2.44, p=.023,
d=1.40; Adult: M=3.76, SD=0.70, t(20)=11.53, p<.001,
d=5.16).

Summary. Unlike for the typical condition, participants in
the diverse condition endorsed the diverse informant just as
often as they asked that informant. There were, however,
overall age differences in whether or not participants
preferred the diverse informant: older children and adults
preferred the diverse informant above chance levels, and
younger children did not. Like in the typical condition, these
findings were supported in how participants rated the
informants; older children and adults saw the diverse
informant as more trustworthy than the non-diverse
informant, but younger children did not.

Developmental variation in trustworthiness ratings.
Next, to examine developmental differences in participants’
ratings of trustworthiness, we conducted an ANOVA on
informant trustworthiness rating scores where informant

Discussion
Researchers suggest that tracking informant trustworthiness
is important, but most of the research to date has focused on
cases in which tracking trustworthiness is arguably least
important—when you already know the answer. In most
real-life learning situations, learners are not likely to have
the answers, and thus must use evaluative methods of
trustworthiness other than assessing veracity.
Recent research investigating the tracking of information
quantity provides a good start. This work shows that even
young children recognize when an informant is omitting
information that may lead to false beliefs (e.g., Gweon et
al., 2014). However, even in these paradigms, children have
been able to rely on their prior knowledge and experience to
recognize when someone is being truthful, but
uninformative. So, how can a learner evaluate the content of
information when he or she lacks knowledge? Our research
demonstrates that learners can use inferences about the
quality of information. In these instances, the inferences
learners make about trustworthiness are bootstrapped off
more general background knowledge about a domain as
opposed specific knowledge about the correctness of the
evidence provided. Thus, the current study provides an
initial indication of how children might infer who to trust in
more general cases.
Our results show that, whereas young children are not
reliably using example typicality and diversity when
determining whom to trust, older children seem to be in the
middle of a developmental transition. They (either above
chance or trending toward) prefer the informant providing
stronger examples, and they explicitly rate those informants
as more trustworthy. Thus, we find a similar developmental
pattern to Rhodes et al (2008) where around 9 years of age,
children are beginning to consider the benefits of typical
and diverse examples. However, our work takes a step
further—demonstrating that in addition to recognizing the
benefits of typical and diverse examples, children around 9
years of age can leverage example quality to evaluate
informants’ trustworthiness.
