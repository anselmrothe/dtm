Abstract

preferences when decision problems that are
related to one another are presented within-subjects
(e.g., Kahneman, 2003; Stanovich & West, 2008).
Such individuals are more likely to notice that
decision problems are related (e.g., that one
decision problem can be derived from another
mathematically) and to reconcile their answers to
the problems, diminishing framing effects and
other cognitive biases. The mix of such individuals
in samples of subjects determines the magnitude of
within-subjects reduction in framing effects,
relative to between-subjects effects. We account
for experimental evidence from several classic
decision problems and experimental manipulations
of these problems (e.g., Kühberger & Tanner,
2010; Peters & Levin, 2008; Tversky &
Kahneman, 1981). Standard theories cannot
account for all of these effects; indeed, some
effects contradict standard predictions (such as
those made by cumulative prospect theory (CPT;
Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). We apply our
formalization to explain how experimental
manipulations of decision problems change
decision outcomes.

We propose a new model of risk preferences that integrates
theoretical principles relevant to mental representation,
metacognitive monitoring and editing, and individual
differences in risk-taking propensity. Our model is based on
fuzzy-trace theory, a theory of decision-making under risk.
The theory posits that decision-makers use fuzzy gist
representations of the meaning of decision information, in
parallel with precise verbatim representations of the exact
wording of that information. We account for core phenomena
in decision theory, such as shifts in risk preference when
logically equivalent gambles are described in terms of gains
rather than losses—framing effects—and also extend fuzzytrace theory beyond these phenomena to encompass research
on affect and personality.

Introduction
Fuzzy-trace theory is a leading account of decisionmaking under risk. In prior work (Broniatowski &
Reyna, 2014) we presented a formalization of
fuzzy-trace theory that predicted modal responses
for risky decisions; however, this prior model did
not predict effect sizes. In this paper, we use a
parsimonious logistic model of choice to predict
effect sizes. We show how risk preferences are
determined by combining multiple representations
(e.g., Reyna & Brainerd, 2011) of decision options.
Our model formalizes the formation of multiple
mental representations of risky choice gambles and
how the ultimate preference is determined by
applying “voting” rules that adjudicate among
representations that support differing preferences.
The model also incorporates an explicit mechanism
for adjusting preferences based on metacognitive
monitoring and editing (e.g., Stanovich, West, &
Toplak, 2011). That is, people who are high in
Need for Cognition (NFC) and cognitive ability
(e.g., intelligence) have been shown to edit their

Key Tenets of Fuzzy-Trace Theory
The central tenet of fuzzy-trace theory is that
people encode, store, retrieve, and forget memories
that are characterized by different levels of detail
and meaningfulness. We refer to these levels as
“gist” and “verbatim.” Research on fuzzy-trace
theory has shown that gist and verbatim
representations are encoded separately and roughly
in parallel (see Reyna, 2012). A gist representation
captures the basic meaning, or "essence," of a
stimulus. In contrast, a verbatim representation of

a stimulus captures its surface form (e.g., Clark &
Clark, 1977).

treatment has a high risk relative to the second
treatment.

Fuzzy Processing: Categorical Decision-Making is
Preferred

Interval Comparisons

When categorical and ordinal comparisons lead
to an indeterminate decision outcome, even more
precise representations such as comparing intervallevel values become evident. For example, the
classical expected value (i.e., the product of
outcomes and probabilities) is an interval
representation, which we predict that subjects
encode.
Using interval-level numbers, the
expected value of a decision option with a 1.0
probability of winning $180 is 1.0 multiplied by
$180. In contrast, another option with a .90
probability of winning $250 has an expected value
of $250 multiplied by .90 (plus .10 times $0).

Another tenet of fuzzy-trace theory is that
decision-makers prefer to operate on the simplest
gist that can be extracted from information. For
numerical information, differences in levels of
precision can be thought of in terms of scales of
measurement: the simplest level is categorical or
nominal because that level is the least fine-grained.
Categorical gist entails representing decision
outcomes as members of different categories, such
as “no money” versus “some money.” This fuzzyprocessing preference increases with experience in
a domain (e.g., Reyna, Chick, Corbin, & Hsia,
2014; Reyna & Lloyd, 2006). When two decision
outcomes fall into different qualitative categories
(e.g., no money vs. some money), the gist
representation compares these two categories
rather than the specific details. Each of these
categories is associated with a valence (e.g., money
has a positive valence) and the category that is
more highly valued (e.g., some money) will be
chosen.

Values: Decisions made by Comparing Valenced
Affects

The final tenet of fuzzy-trace theory that we
review is that decisions are made on the basis of
simple valenced (i.e., positive or negative) affect
(e.g., Peters & Levin 2008). Thus, once options are
represented in a categorical, ordinal, or interval
fashion, the more positively valenced option is
chosen (e.g., winning money is preferred; saving
lives is preferred). Consider the decision below:
1. Winning $180
2. .90 chance of winning $250 and .10 chance
of no money.
The categorical gist representation is:
1. Some money
2. Some chance of some money and some
chance of no money.
Given the affective value that some money is
preferred to no money (i.e., money has a positive
valence), the categorical gist would favor option 1.
In contrast, the ordinal representation is indifferent
between these two options because more money
($250) is preferred to less money ($180), but less
money ($180) is preferred to no money (vote is 0).
Finally, the interval, or verbatim, representation
would favor option 2 because the expected value of
money is $225, greater than the $180 of option 1.
The categorical and interval representations in this
problem favor different options (the sure vs. risky

Ordinal Comparisons

Fuzzy-trace theory predicts that subjects interpret
decision outcomes on a continuum of detail
ranging from categorical gist (e.g., win some
money), on one end, to verbatim detail (e.g., win
$200) on the other. More precise but nevertheless
qualitative
representations
are
generated
simultaneously, such as ordinal (i.e., relative)
representations (e.g., small vs. large amount of
money). Levels of distinction that are intermediate
between categorical and verbatim become evident
when two decision options’ outcomes fall into the
same category, and, thus, cannot be discriminated.
For example, if one medical treatment is described
as having a 20% chance of death and another
treatment as having a 10% chance of death, both
treatments can be categorized as having “some”
risk of death (e.g., Reyna, 2008). To discriminate
between treatment options, a more fine-grained
ordinal distinction needs to be made: the first

292

operation is used to combine a and x, yielding a
scalar quantity. Additionally, b is a scalar quantity
representing risk-taking propensity. Thus, people
who are high in NFC and numeracy reduce conflict
between representations by weighting votes from
each representation and risk propensity increases
(or decreases) the tendency to choose riskier
options regardless of representation, NFC, or
numeracy (see next sections).
Numeracy and Need for Cognition In the
domain of decision making, two major individual
difference factors associated with metacognitive
monitoring and editing have been proposed –
numeracy (e.g., Peters et al., 2006) and Need for
Cognition (NFC; Cacioppo et al., 1996; Stanovich
et al., 2011). Peters and colleagues (2006) defined
numeracy as “the ability to process basic
probability and numerical concepts,” and found
that more numerate subjects were less susceptible
to attribute framing effects. In the domain of risky
decision framing, Peters and Levin (2008) found
that more numerate subjects were less likely to
show risky choice framing. As these authors
argued, these results are consistent with the
hypothesis that highly numerate individuals are
more likely to notice that decision problems are
related (e.g., that the loss decision problem can be
derived from the gain version of that problem
mathematically) and to reconcile their answers to
the problems, diminishing cognitive biases such as
framing. We model these effects using the decision
weight vector a.
Risk-Taking Propensity In addition to
individual difference variables, such as
metacognitive monitoring (NFC) and editing
(numerical computation, facilitated by high
numeracy), our model accounts for personality
differences associated with risk-taking, including
factors related to sensation seeking and impulsivity
(e.g., Lauriola et al., 2014). We represent this in
our model by a linear additive risk preference, b,
which, when positive, is used to indicate a fixed
predisposition toward a more risky option. The
linear additive nature of this factor is based on
evidence presented by Reyna, Estrada et al. (2011)
who found evidence supporting independent
effects of subjects’ sensation seeking.

options) and would therefore compete in the sense
that each produces an opposite vote (-1 vs. 1).
Formalizing Fuzzy-Trace Theory
At the categorical level, given a pair of decision
options represented by points, φ and θ, the decision
option corresponding to φ is preferred to the
decision option corresponding to θ if the associated
category is preferred in the domain of values (e.g.,
“some money with some chance” is preferred to
“no money with some chance”). At the ordinal
level, a decision option is preferred if its
corresponding points are strictly preferred along all
dimension of the decision space (e.g., “some
money with more chance” is preferred to “some
money with less chance”) Points in disjoint
categories cannot be compared. At the interval
level, decisions options are evaluated according to
expected values.
An Error Theory for Risky Decision Problems

The model of fuzzy-trace theory outlined thus far
is deterministic – each representation provides one
vote and the option with the most votes is selected.
Here, we account for deviations from this mode.
The need for such an error theory in the domain of
risky decision-making has long been recognized;
for example, Kühberger (1995) remarked on the
absence of an error theory for risky framing
problems. Consistent with the literature on
qualitative discrete choice models, we represent
error using a standard multinomial logistic
distribution (e.g., Luce, 2005). For decisions with
two options, our error is thus distributed according
to a standard logistic distribution – a functional
form that is commonly used in Signal Detection
Theory (e.g., McNicol, 2005) because of its
computational tractability, ease of interpretation,
and its similarity in shape to the cumulative normal
distribution. For our specific application, we model
the probability, P, that a subject will choose a given
decision outcome in a risky choice gamble by
where x is a three-element vector
containing an entry for each representation
(categorical, ordinal, and interval), a is a threeelement vector containing a decision weight
applied to each representation. A dot-product

uncertainty avoidance index as “the degree to
which the members of a society feel uncomfortable
with uncertainty and ambiguity.” Thus, national
culture is one of several factors that may be
associated with risk preference and ambiguity.
Hofstede’s index is significantly correlated with
our risk parameter, b, r(24)=-0.455.

Testing Our Model
We use our formalization to explain the
outcomes of several classic risky choice problems,
such as Tversky and Kahneman’s (1981) Asian
Disease Problem (ADP) and related framing
problems. The text of the gain-framed standard
ADP is as follows: “Imagine that the U.S. is
preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian
disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two
alternative programs to combat the disease have
been proposed. Assume that the exact scientific
estimates of the consequences of the program are
as follows: If Program A is adopted, 200 people
will be saved; If Program B is adopted, there is a
1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved and a
2/3 probability that no people will be saved.”
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1981).
The loss-framed version of the same problem
uses the same preamble but presents the decision
options as: If Program C is adopted 400 people will
die; If Program D is adopted there is a 1/3
probability that nobody will die, and a 2/3
probability that 600 people will die.” (Tversky &
Kahneman, 1981). Options A and C are typically
referred to as the “certain option,” whereas options
B and D are typically referred to as the “gamble
option.” The typical result (framing effect) is that
most people prefer the certain option in the gain
frame, but the risky gamble option in the loss
frame. We fit our model to 26 studies of the ADP
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1981; Reyna & Brainerd
1991; Tindale, Sheffey, & Scott, 1993; Takemura,
1994; Wang & Johnston, 1995; Highhouse &
Yüce, 1996; Wang, 1996; Stanovich & West, 1998;
Druckman, 2001a; 2001b; Mandel, 2001;
Mayhorn, Fisk, & Whittle, 2002; LeBoeuf &
Shafir, 2003; Fischer, Jonas, Frey, &
Kastenmueller, 2008; Zhang & Miao 2008; Zhang,
Xiao, Ma, & Miao, 2008; Horton, Rand, &
Zeckhauser, 2011; Haerem, Kuvaas, Bakken, &
Karlsen, 2011; Berinsky, Huber, & Lens, 2012;
Stein, 2012; Okder, 2012; Kühberger & Gradl,
2013).

Within-Subjects Framing

Prior work has determined that subjects reconcile
answers to gain and loss versions of problems
when both frames are presented within-subjects.
That is, the magnitude of framing effects in risky
choice problems varies systematically with
experimental design. In particular, within-subjects
framing effects, where subjects are exposed to both
gain and loss framing problems, tend to be smaller
than between-subjects effects. Subjects with high
NFC tend to edit their preferences more than those
with low NFC because they are more likely to
notice the common structures underlying these
problems (i.e., high NFC subjects display “analytic
override;” Kahneman 2003; LeBoeuf & Shafir,
2003; Stanovich et al., 2011). Thus, analytic
override occurs when the same subject is exposed
to two oppositely framed versions of the same
problem. This should be reflected in our model by
the presence of scale parameters that are
significantly smaller than those found in the
standard ADP. The average scale-factor value for
several studies (Stanovich & West, 1998; Levin,
Gaeth, Schreiber, & Lauriola, 2002; LeBoeuf &
Shafir, 2003) in which framing was manipulated
within-subjects is 0.47 – smaller than the values
for 26 studies in which framing was manipulated
between-subjects, t(62)=3.00, p<0.01.
Explaining Truncation Problems

The concept of gist is central to our theory of how
decision-makers perceive options. Manipulations
of these gist representations can result in different
framing effects, or the absence of an effect
altogether. Specifically, by emphasizing or
removing certain stimuli from a problem in such a
way that its expected value does not change, one
might change the gist of a decision option (e.g., one
might not mention options with zero expected
value). PT and its successor, CPT, predict that

Each of the studies listed above is associated with
a country of origin from which the subjects were
recruited. Hofstede (1991) defined a nation’s

strong as that found in the standard ADP because
of the combined contributions of the categorical
representation and the ordinal representation, both
of which support the certain option (the interval
representation is indifferent) – i.e., x=[-1,-1,0] – in
the gain frame. Similar results obtain for the loss
frame. The average scale-factor value for several
studies (Reyna & Brainerd, 1991; Kühberger,
2010; Reyna et al., 2014) for this class of framing
problem is 1.2, which is exactly twice the values
for the corresponding standard framing problems,
0.6 in the same studies. This difference is
statistically significant, t(32)=8.38, p<0.001.

these manipulations do not change preferences;
thus, these “truncation” experiments were initially
performed as critical tests of fuzzy-trace theory by
Reyna and Brainerd (1991) and later replicated by
others (e.g., Kühberger & Tanner, 2010; Reyna et
al., 2014). All of these investigators determined
that framing effects did not persist when the zerocomplement in the gamble option of the ADP (i.e.,
“none are saved”) was removed (a selective
attention effect; Reyna, 2008; Reyna, 2012). These
effects do not depend on ambiguity; when all of the
information is supplied (but attention is focused
selectively in different ways), effects remain the
same.
Zero-Complement
Truncated
Framing
Problems The zero-complement truncated gainframed ADP is worded as follows: If Program A is
adopted, 200 people will be saved; If Program B is
adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people
will be saved. Here, the “2/3 probability that no
people will be saved” part of the gamble has been
removed. This version of the ADP has the same
expected value as the standard ADP. Both options
are interpreted as “Some chance that some live”
leading to indifference at the categorical level. The
ordinal representation is also indifferent:
a) Fewer live with more probability
b) More live with less probability
Finally, the more precise interval representation
is also indifferent.
a) 200 saved = expectation of 200 saved
b) 600 saved with 1/3 probability = expectation
of 200 saved
Both options have the same expected value,
leading to indifference – i.e., x=[0,0,0] – and
resulting in the absence of a framing effect as
reported by Reyna et al. (2014) and others. The
loss-framed version of the problem yields similar
results (400 die vs. 600 die with 2/3 probability).
We found no significant difference between our
model’s prediction of no framing effect and the
data from several replications of the zero-truncated
framing problem (Reyna & Brainerd, 1991;
Mandel, 2001; Kühberger, 2010; Reyna et al.,
2014).
Non-Zero Complement Truncated ADP The
opposite truncation effect, which retains the zero
complement, yields a framing effect that is twice as

Conclusions
Our mathematical framework builds upon three
basic tenets of fuzzy-trace theory – the
gist/verbatim
distinction
(formalized
by
theoretically-motivated, and empirically-tested,
subcategories of representations), the hierarchy of
gist (formalized by our extended fuzzy processing
preference and associated lattices), and preferences
over these gist categories based on valenced affect.
Our formalized theory, therefore, explains a wide
variety of phenomena, integrating known effects
and novel predictions.
