Abstract
The present study investigated how learners use feedback
information on their test results. We also examined the effects
of the type of feedback and learners’ achievement goals on
the manner in which feedback information was reviewed. In
an experimental study (N = 42 undergraduate and graduate
students), we tracked eye movements of the participants while
they took a critical thinking test and received their test results.
The results showed that most participants checked feedback
for incorrectly-answered questions but not for correctlyanswered questions. This suggests that learners do not use
feedback information to judge the adequacy of the process of
solving. In addition, these tendencies were not different
between feedback conditions. Furthermore, participants’
achievement goals predicted learners’ review activities.
Specifically, learners with higher mastery goals tended to
check feedback for correctly-answered questions. Therefore,
fostering the pursuit of mastery goals may prompt learners to
use feedback information to enhance their comprehension.

Introduction
The information provided in feedback is a critical
component of learning because it enables learners to correct
errors and judge the adequacy of the process of solving
problems (Butler, Godbole, & Marsh, 2013). Previous
studies have shown the efficacy of feedback (e.g., Hattie &
Timperley, 2007; Kluger & DeNisi, 1996). For example,
Nakano (1986) showed that students who corrected and
elaborated upon their responses after receiving feedback
information achieved higher performance levels. In addition,
learners can monitor the effectiveness of their learning
strategies and react to feedback by altering strategies
employed during studying (Zimmerman, 1990). Therefore,
learners are encouraged to use feedback information to
enhance their comprehension and monitor the effectiveness
of their learning strategies after they receive feedback on
their performance (Dansereau et al., 1979).
However, do learners spontaneously use feedback
information to enhance their performance? Some studies
(e.g., Maclellan, 2001) posit that many learners do not
regard feedback as useful or as an opportunity to review and
improve their learning. If learners do not use feedback
information effectively, ample information in the feedback
message is rendered useless. Unfortunately, previous studies
have not examined learners’ spontaneous use of feedback

information. Thus, the present study investigates how
learners use feedback information while they are checking
feedback information through the analysis of their eye
movements. The eye tracking method has been used to
study cognitive processes during information processing
(Lai et al., 2013; Rayner, 1998). This method is capable of
recording online cognitive activities, and therefore it is a
promising tool for investigating cognitive process.
In addition, it is important to identify factors that affect
learners’ review activities such as correcting errors or
judging the adequacy of the process of solving in order to
obtain implications for educational practice. Consequently,
our intent was to investigate what external and internal
factors affect learners’ use of feedback information.
Specifically, we focused on the type of feedback received as
external factors and on learners’ achievement goals as
internal factors.

The type of feedback
A primary objective of a feedback study is to determine
what information should be provided to learners for the
feedback to be effective (Butler et al., 2013). On the basis of
past studies, Butler et al. (2013) indicate that feedback must
contain correct answers and information on the accuracy of
learners’ responses. In contrast, previous studies have
shown that social comparative information undermines
subsequent performance and interest compared to selfreferenced feedback and written verbal comment (Butler,
1987; Shih & Alexander, 2000). Particularly notable is
Butler’s (1988) finding that learners who received taskinvolving comments continued to express high interest and
performance, whereas learners who received numerical
grades or both grades and comments exhibited decreased
interest and performance. Butler (1988) interpreted that
grades were perceived primarily as salient extrinsic
incentives. If social comparative information is salient and
draws learners’ attention, then learners’ review activities
such as checking correct answers may be impaired.
Therefore, we focused on social comparative information
and investigated its effects on review activities.

Achievement goals
Achievement goals are defined as specific orientations that
represent the desire to pursue an achievement task and are
important factors that relate to intrinsic motivation and the

2308

use of learning strategies (e.g., Ames, 1992; Elliot, 1999).
Traditionally, two types of achievement goals have been
distinguished: mastery goals and performance goals. They
differ with respect to the reason why students are pursuing
an achievement task. Mastery goals orient learners toward
self-improvement and task mastery, whereas performance
goals orient learners toward the demonstration of
competence relative to others. Recent studies (e.g., Elliot &
McGregor, 2001; Elliot & Murayama, 2008) suggest a 2 × 2
achievement goal framework in which an approach–
avoidance dimension that contrasts the desire of
approaching positive outcomes to that of avoiding negative
outcomes is integrated (for further extension of this
framework, see Elliot, Murayama, & Pekrun, 2011).
However, there are few studies that utilize a 2 × 2
achievement goal framework. Thus, we focused on a
trichotomous goal model that included the goals most
commonly endorsed by learners, namely mastery goals,
performance-approach goals, and performance-avoidance
goals (Elliot & Church, 1997).
Mastery goals are positively related to deep-processing
strategies that involve semantic understanding of study
materials or solutions, persistence, and effort during
studying (Elliot, McGregor, & Gable, 1999). It is predicted
that learners with higher mastery goals will devote attention
to information about self-improvement. Performanceapproach goals, which focus on the attainment of
competence relative to others, are viewed as similar to
mastery goals in that they focus on potential positive
outcomes (Elliot et al., 1999). However, performanceapproach goals differ from mastery goals in that they focus
on an extrinsic achievement outcome. In fact, performanceapproach goals are not linked with deep-processing
strategies. Therefore, it is predicted that learners with higher
performance-approach goals tend to devote attention to
information on performance rather than self-improvement.
Performance-avoidance goals, which focus on the avoidance
of incompetence relative to others, are negatively correlated
with deep-processing strategies and task enjoyment (Elliot
& Harackiewicz, 1996; Elliot et al., 1999). So, it is
predicted that learners with higher performance-avoidance
goals will avoid checking the feedback information.

Method
Participants and design
Forty-two Japanese undergraduate and graduate students (18
males and 24 females) participated in return for payment.
The participants were randomly assigned to the control
condition (n = 21) or the normative feedback condition (n =
21). In both groups, participants received post-test
information on their correct and incorrect responses on an
item by item basis, a total score, and a description of the
skill measured by the test. In the normative feedback
condition, participants were additionally provided with an
average undergraduate score and a relative ranking. Relative
ranking information indicates the rank of a participant with

respect to the others: it signifies if the total score of the
participants was among the highest 5%, 20%, 35% or 50%,
or the lowest 35%, 20% or 5%.
Figure 1 presents the example of feedback in the
normative feedback condition: (a) the participant’s own
total score; (b) average score of undergraduate students; (c)
relative ranking; (d) description of the skill measured by the
test; (e) the participant’s own correct and incorrect response
on an item by item basis (“○” denotes a correct response and
“×” denotes an incorrect response). Additionally, correct
answers and explanations of how to solve questions were
hyperlinked corresponding to the number for each item; and
(f) a quit button. Note that, in the control condition, (b)
average score of undergraduate students and (c) relative
ranking were not provided.

Apparatus
Eye movements were recorded using a Tobii TX300 (screen
size: 23”; screen resolution: 1920 × 1080). Participants sat
60 cm from the screen and their head movements were
minimized via use of a chin rest.
Two eye tracking indicators were employed on the basis
of two areas of interest (AOIs), each of which corresponded
to information on performance and correctness (see Figure
1). The type and size of the chosen AOIs were the same for
the two conditions. We used two types of data in analysis:
total fixation duration and fixation count. The Tobii I-VT
Fixation Filter’s default values (Tobii Technology, 2012)
were used to filter fixation.

Materials
The critical thinking test used in this study was developed
by Kusumi et al. (2010). Critical thinking is defined as
“reasonable reflection about what we believe and do” (Ennis,
1987), and central in most definitions of 21st century skills.
It seems to be increasingly important for undergraduates to
acquire critical thinking ability as the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) began
the Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes
(AHELO) in 2010. We employed a critical thinking test
because participants seem to not seriously check feedback
information if they did not consider their test performance
as important. Our thinking was that many participants
should value their critical thinking skills more than their
knowledge of subject material in a domain they are not
invested in.
The test was originally developed by referring to the
theoretical frameworks of previous studies on critical
thinking (e.g., Ennis, 1987). The test comprised 23 items
measuring three major skills: (1) five items for
understanding of structure (e.g., identifying opinion and
conclusions, stipulating meaning, and clarifying reasons),
(2) 13 items for reasoning based on passages (e.g.,
analyzing implicit assumptions and analogies, as well as
strengthening/weakening the argument), and (3) five items
for scientific argument (e.g., analyzing and evaluating the
design of experiment/study, and 2 × 2 contingency tables).

Correct answers and explanations of how to solve questions were hyperlinked corresponding to the number
for each item; and (f) a quit button.
In order to select the items for this study, we used the
data obtained by Kusumi et al. (2010). The data consisted of
301 undergraduate students (135 males and 166 females,
mean age 19.9 years) from 81 different universities in a
metropolitan area in Japan. In this study, three items for
reasoning based on passages and three items for scientific
argument were selected such that the average correct
response rate across all items in the set was about 50% (i.e.,
average score of six items was about 3.0). Average correct
response rates of each item ranged from 18% (difficult item)
to 89% (easy item) (from Kusumi at al., 2000). The items
had a mean length of 456 characters (SD = 90, range: 297–
565). All items were multiple-choice with five choices.

Procedure
The experiment was conducted on an individual basis with
participants seated at the computer. Participants were
instructed to take the critical thinking test. To motivate the
participants to take the test and check the feedback
information, the experimenter explained the importance of
acquiring critical thinking ability. The experimenters
informed participants that they would receive feedback on
their performance; however, they did not explain specific
details of the information. In addition, participants were
informed that they could quit checking the feedback
information at any time by clicking a quit button at the
bottom of the screen.
Participants completed a nine-item questionnaire on
achievement goals before taking the test. Then, eye fixations

and saccades were calibrated for each participant using the
device’s calibration tool. No time limit was placed on taking
the test. The participants were asked to take a short break
each time they completed two questions. Eye fixations and
saccades were re-calibrated after the break. Feedback
information on his or her test result was provided on the
screen after each participant completed the sixth question.

Questionnaire
Participants’ achievement goals were assessed using
adapted versions of the items developed by Tanaka and
Yamauchi (2000). To assess participants’ goals related to
the upcoming test, a reference to the test was added to the
items: mastery goals (comprised of three items including
statements such as “I want to understand the content of this
test as thoroughly as possible”; α = .57), performanceapproach goals (comprised of three items including
statements such as “I want to perform well on this test
relative to other students”; α = .80), performance-avoidance
goals (comprised of three items including statements such as
“I want to avoid doing worse in this test than other
students”; α = .85). The participants responded to each item
on a scale from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree).

Results
Descriptive statistics and correlations
Table 1 presents the mean values and standard deviations of

2310

the achievement goals and test score. The means of test
score in both conditions were higher than the average score
(i.e., 3.0) obtained by Kusumi et al. (2010). Independent
sample t-tests revealed that no significant differences
existed in achievement goals and test score between the two
conditions.
Table 2 presents the correlations between achievement
goals and test score. Achievement goals were not related to
test score. Mastery goals did not correlate with performance
goals, whereas correlation between performance-approach
goals and performance-avoidance goals was highly positive.
Table 3 presents the frequency distribution of the rate of
checking of correct answers. Most participants checked all
correct answers on incorrectly-answered questions (17 in the
control and 16 in the normative feedback condition),
whereas half of the participants never checked correct
answer on correctly-answered questions (10 in the control
and 12 in the normative feedback condition). In addition,
Table 4 presents the number of participants who checked
correct answers and the correct way to solve the question,
and the time spent checking them.

The effects of the type of feedback and achievement
goals
We used a generalized linear model to examine the effects
of the type of feedback and achievement goals on the rate of
checking of correct answers. To assess the effects of the
feedback condition, a dummy variable was included; the
normative feedback condition was coded 1 and the control
feedback condition was coded 0. The analysis for
incorrectly-answered questions showed that none of the
factors affected the rate of checking of correct answers. The

analysis for correctly-answered questions showed that
mastery goals affected the frequency of checking of correct
answers (b = 1.49, odds ratio = 4.44, p < .01); however,
other factors had no effect.
Furthermore, we used a generalized linear model to
examine the effects of the type of feedback and achievement
goals on eye movements. Table 5 presents the means and
standard deviations of total fixation duration and the
fixation count. To reduce complexity, only fixation count
was used as dependent variables. The analysis for fixation
count on performance (Table 6) revealed that the feedback
condition had a positive effect. Thus, the fixation count was
greater in the normative feedback condition than in the
control condition. In addition, performance-approach goals
had a positive effect and performance-avoidance goals had a
negative effect. The analysis for fixation count on
correctness revealed that test score had a negative effect and
mastery goals had a positive effect.

they answered incorrectly, whereas about half did not
check them for questions they answered correctly. These
findings suggest that learners tend to correct errors, but
they do not judge the adequacy of the process of solving
these problems, nor do they think of better solutions.
With regard to the influence of the type of feedback,
fixation count on performance was greater in the normative
feedback condition than in the control condition. Because
the amount of information on performance in the normative
feedback condition is more than in the control condition,
these results do not necessarily mean that social
comparative feedback draws learners’ attention. In addition,
the type of feedback had no effect on checking of correct
answers and being fixated on correctness. These findings
imply that social comparative feedback does not necessarily
impair learners’ review activities.
One possible explanation for the null effect of social
comparative information could be the high achievements of
participants on the test. Butler (1988) found that low
achievers who received numerical grades notably exhibited
reduced interest and performance. Therefore, we speculate
that the effect of social comparative information is not
found because most participants in the present study
received a higher than average score. In addition, the effects
of feedback may be mediated by other factors. For example,
recent studies have investigated learners’ perspectives of
tests and feedback and showed that the effects of tests and

feedback depend on the students’ perceptions of them (e.g.,
Rakoczy et al., 2013; Suzuki, 2011). Rakoczy et al. (2013)
showed that there were no significant direct effects of
feedback on interest and achievement development, but
there were significant indirect effects on interest and
achievement via perceived competence support and
usefulness. This shows that further study is necessary to
clarify the effects of providing social comparative
information.
With regard to the effects of achievement goals, the
hypotheses received some support. Performance-approach
goals, which orient learners toward the demonstration of
competence relative to others, had a positive effect on
fixation count on performance. In contrast, performanceavoidance goals, which orient learners toward the avoidance
of negative outcomes, had a negative effect on fixation
count on performance. In addition, mastery goals, which
orient learners toward task mastery, had a positive effect on
checking of sample answers and a fixation on correctness.
The fixation count increases with checking of correct
answers and ways to solve questions. Thus, learners with
higher mastery goals tend to review and understand the
feedback content as thoroughly as possible so that they may
enhance their comprehension. These findings imply that
increasing learners’ mastery goals may contribute to review
activities such as correcting mistakes or judging adequacy
of the process of solving after taking tests. For example, the
anticipation of temporal evaluation enhances the adoption of
mastery goals (e.g., Butler, 2006; Pekrun et al., 2014).
Our study has several limitations. First, this study was
conducted in a laboratory context rather than in an
ecologically valid setting. Thus, further experiments need to
be conducted in an ecologically valid setting such as an
actual classroom. Second, the study did not consider the
influence of feedback information on subsequent
performance. Achievement feedback is known as one of the
most powerful influences on learning (Hattie, 2009). Future
studies would examine the relation between eye movements
during the checking of feedback information and subsequent
learners’ performance. Finally, our findings pertain to
undergraduates and graduates. We should examine the
generalizability of this study to different age groups and
cultures. In addition, other types of feedback such as
feedback using absolute standards or self-referenced
feedback could be employed.
