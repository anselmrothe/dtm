Abstract

cognitive theories of causation too, and few researchers
have tackled the subject either experimentally or
theoretically.
Our goal is accordingly to develop a new theory of
causation by omission. We begin by reviewing the
philosophical and psychological challenges that omissive
causation presents, and describe a recent theory based on the
transmission of causal forces that was designed to overcome
some of those problems (Wolff, Barbey, Hausknecht, 2010).
In light of some dilemmas facing the force theory, we
describe an alternative account of causation based on mental
models. Mental models represent possible states of the
world, observed or imagined (Goldvarg & Johnson-Laird,
2001). Our theory relies on the assumption that people build
discrete mental simulations to understand causal relations
(Khemlani, Barbey, & Johnson-Laird, 2014), and we apply
that analysis to issues concerning omissive causation. We
derive several predictions of our account and contrast them
with those from the force theory. Finally, we end with a
discussion of outstanding issues and plans for future
research that may further differentiate our new account from
the force theory and other competitors.

Current psychological accounts of causal representation and
reasoning do not capture phenomena related to causation by
omission (e.g., “The absence of breathing causes death”),
with one exception (Wolff, Barbey, & Hausknecht, 2010). We
describe a novel theory of omissive causation that posits that
people build discrete mental simulations – mental models – of
causal relations (Goldvarg & Johnson-Laird 2001). The
theory states that causes by omission refer to a set of
temporally ordered models of possibilities. Reasoners tend to
focus on only one of those models, i.e., the possibility in
which breathing does not occur and death subsequently does.
Likewise, the theory posits that reasoners distinguish between
omission in the context of causation, enabling conditions, and
prevention. We describe some initial predictions made by the
model-based account, contrast it with an alternative
psychological theory based on the transmission of causal
forces, and set out directions for further research.

Introduction
A woman from Cincinnati, Ohio, was recently awarded
$1.2 million in a malpractice suit (Hunt, 2014). The jury
found her doctor guilty of malpractice concerning his
negligence in adequately diagnosing her abdominal pain.
Her doctor did not give her a CT scan until she was
critically ill, i.e., suffering from acute respiratory distress
syndrome. The jury concluded that not diagnosing her
illness in a timely manner had a permanent, debilitating
effect on the woman’s life: she is unable to move without a
walker as a result of her breathing difficulty.
When a doctor is a defendant in malpractice litigation
concerning negligence, the central issue concerns omissive
causation: did a failure to perform one or more actions
adversely affect the doctor’s patient? Omissive causation,
more generally, concerns a causal link between a failure of
an event to occur and the consequences of that failure (see
Paul & Hall, 2013). Issues concerning causation by
omission are prevalent in healthcare, public policy, and
legal fields (Ferrara, 2013), where the costs of a failure to
act have monetary and legal consequences. The ontological
issues undergirding those discussions are a topic of
controversy among philosophers, who are concerned with
the peculiar sorts of problems that omissive causation
generates. Omissions are deeply problematic when treated
within standard theoretical frameworks for understanding
causation. The problems are so severe that some
philosophers have even suggested carving up causation into
two distinct concepts in order to accommodate omissions
(Hall, 2004). The problem vexes psychological and

Omissive causation in philosophy
Philosophical theories of causation fall into two distinct
categories: dependency theories and process theories.
Dependency theories interpret causation as concerning
statistical (Skyrms, 1980), counterfactual (Lewis, 1973),
logical, or structured probabilistic (Halpern & Pearl, 2005)
dependencies. In counterfactual dependency models, for
example, A causes B is equivalent to the following
counterfactual assertion: if A hadn't occurred, then B
wouldn't have occurred. Process-theoretic approaches, in
contrast, treat causation as being understood by way of
contact and transfer of quantity, such as energies, forces,
and masses (Dowe, 2000; Salmon, 1994). Process theories
often make specific claims about the vehicle or mode of
causation, whereas many dependency theories do not.
Both dependency and process theories of causation have
trouble accounting for omissive causation. The most glaring
issue for process theorists is that there can be no transfer of
quantity in the case of an omission. For example, consider
the following vignette (adapted from Paul & Hall, 2013):
1.

Billy decides not to take any medicine and falls ill.

It seems as if Billy’s refusal to take medicine is the cause of
his illness. But there does not appear to be any energy,
force, or mass that is conserved or transferred between the
subject and the object of the causal relation.

As dependency theories do not make claims about the
mode of causation, omissions can be causes. An omission
can be interpreted as a probability, a counterfactual
situation, a logical relation, and so forth. The trouble with
adopting this kind of ecumenism is that it overprescribes
causes in a manner at odds with intuitions. Consider the
following vignette:
2.

represent, compose, and reason with causal relations given a
limited cognitive bandwidth. The kind of causal profligacy
that follows from philosophical dependency theories in the
case of omissions does not vex psychologists. Instead, the
challenge in psychology is to solve the inverse problem of
deciding what information reasoners take into account when
deducing or inducing a causal relation and how they go
about representing and reasoning about such relations.
Psychologists disagree about the mechanisms and
representations that underlie causal reasoning (Sloman &
Lagnado 2015). Like philosophers, some psychologists
align with dependency theorists insofar as they focus on
causal model structure (Sloman et al., 2009) and mental
models of possibilities (Goldvarg & Johnson-Laird, 2001).
Others are more akin to process theorists, and appeal to the
transmission of force to explain causal reasoning (Wolff,
2007).
Perhaps because of the pressing challenge of reconciling
omissive causation with the transmission of causal forces,
Wolff and his colleagues proposed the only known
psychological account of omissive causation (Wolff et al.,
2010), an extension of an augmented process theory of
causation called the force theory (Wolff, 2007). We describe
the theory and its account of omissive causation in the
following sections.

You come home after a business trip to find your
rosebushes desiccated and ruined. You learn from
your neighbor that your gardener did not show up
to water the plants.

Our intuitions might suggest that the gardener caused the
flowers to die by not showing up to do his job. And indeed,
the causal relationship is transparent in light of the
counterfactual dependency theory, in which the following
analysis is felicitous: if the gardener had done his job, your
flowers would not have died. What about your neighbor?
She too could have watered the flowers and prevented them
from dying. Is her omission a cause of the flowers dying?
Perhaps it is, but perhaps not. Philosophical theories based
on dependencies lack an appropriate mechanism to restrain
causation from being applied liberally in cases of omission.
McGrath (2005) observes that dependency theories predict
far more causation by omission in the world than instances
of active causation. There are no widely adopted solutions
to this problem of profligate omissive causes. Recent
theorists have augmented dependency theories with
normative considerations to determining the most intuitive
cause of an outcome with multiple putative causes,
following suggestions originally made in Hart and Honoré
(1985). For example, a counterfactual dependency theory
that imported normative principles might posit the following
extension: “in the absence of abnormal conditions, if A
hadn’t occurred, then B wouldn’t have occurred” (Halpern
& Hitchcock, 2014). Just what constitutes normality may be
a deeper and more elusive concept. We turn next to
psychological treatments of causation and omissive
causation.

The force theory
The force theory posits that individuals build mental
simulations of interacting entities. The theory represents
their interactions as vectors between an affector (usually the
subject of a causal assertion), a patient (usually the object of
the assertion), and an end state (the causal effect of the
affector on the patient). The vectors represent directions and
magnitudes of interacting causal forces based on three
parameters: i) the tendency of the patient towards an end
state; ii) the amount of concordance between the affector
and the patient; and iii) progress toward the end state.
Consider the following causal statement:
3.

Psychological theories of causation

Beard trimmings caused the sink to clog up.

In the force theory, the affector would be the trimmings, the
patient would be the sink, and the end state would be the
clogged state of the sink. In the absence of the trimmings,
the sink has no tendency to be clogged. The trimmings acted
against the sink being open (and not in concordance) and the
sink ended up clogged as a result of the trimmings. The
three parameters used to build vector representations would
be parameterized for (3) as follows: i) there is no initial
tendency of the sink towards the state of being clogged; ii)
there is no concordance between the sink and the trimmings;
and iii) the trimmings move the sink towards the state of
being clogged. This parameterization yields a vector
diagram as depicted in Figure 1a. Other causal relations,
such as enabling conditions and prevention, rely on different
permutations of the forces described (Wolff, 2007). For
example, the prevention relation is depicted in Figure 1b.

For philosophers, a productive theory of causal reasoning
and omissive causation is one that can characterize the states
in the world that correspond to causal scenarios. For
cognitive scientists and psychologists, the focus is on how
human minds grasp and manipulate causal relationships.
The enterprise is descriptive rather than prescriptive. A
fundamental psychological assumption is that mental
resources are finite. Accordingly, it is impossible for
reasoners to consider the infinitude of omissive and
incidental causal judgments that may be possible granted
certain ontological commitments, just as it is impossible for
people to represent quantified expressions, e.g., “All the
morticians are venal”, as sets of infinite elements, and sets
of those sets (Partee, 1979). Psychological theories of
causation accordingly focus on how people mentally

Exposing a flower to sunlight enables it to bloom. The
model theory posits that it refers to a different conjunction
of possibilities:

can also include abstract symbols, e.g., the symbol for negation
(Khemlani, Orenes, & Johnson-Laird, 2012).
3. The principle of truth: mental models represent only what is
true and not what is false. More models mean more processing
difficulties – reasoners make errors more frequently and take
longer to draw conclusions when they need to keep multiple
models in mind to solve a problem. And they overlook
possibilities that render a given statement false.

sunlight
sunlight
¬ sunlight

The model theory distinguishes between mental models –
models of an assertion that represent only those possibilities
that render the assertion true – and fully explicit models –
those that include additional possibilities that capture
situations in which the premises are false. We focus on the
model theory’s application to causal reasoning (Goldvarg &
Johnson-Laird, 2011). The theory distinguishes between
different causal relations – such as cause, enable, and
prevent – by positing that those relations refer to distinct
sets of possibilities, i.e., distinct fully explicit models.
Consider a causal assertion such as: Spraying a flower with
acid causes it to die. The theory proposes that the assertion
refers to a conjunction of three separate fully explicit
models of possibilities, depicted in the following schematic
diagram:
acid
¬ acid
¬ acid

This is to say that exposure to sunlight enables a flower to
bloom is to allow that the flower may not bloom in the
presence of sunlight, e.g., the situation in which the flower
was frozen in a block of ice. The enabling condition is
inconsistent with the possibility in which the flower blooms
in the absence of sunlight. Just as with causal assertions,
reasoners do not tend to build fully explicit models of
enabling conditions. Instead, they consider only the first
possibility:
sunlight

Event-A

acid
¬ acid
¬ acid

¬ bloom
¬ bloom
bloom

and the mental model of a prevention condition is
accordingly:
acid

death

¬ bloom

Given the distinctions in meaning between causal
relations, how might the model theory account incorporate
causation by omission? We present our proposal in the next
section.

Reasoners can flesh out the other possibilities, but do so
only when prompted to, and so they err systematically as a
result representing mental models and not fully explicit
models (Goldvarg & Johnson-Laird, Experiment 3). An
accurate combination of two mental models refers to the
Cartesian product of the fully explicit models (Ibid., p. 580).
Hence, an accurate combination of A causes B and B causes
C refers to the following models:
B
B
¬ B
¬ B

Event-B

What distinguishes the two assertions are the fully explicit
models to which they refer. Hence, the theory predicts that
individuals should often fail to distinguish enabling from
causing. Evidence corroborates the failure (Goldvarg &
Johnson-Laird, 2001, Experiment 5).
Prevention in the model theory, e.g., Acid prevents a
flower from blooming, is interpreted in a manner equivalent
to Acid causes the flower not to bloom. Hence, models are
built by tagging antecedent events with symbols for
negation:

The rows in the diagram represent different temporally
ordered possibilities, and ‘¬’ is the symbol for negation
(Khemlani et al., 2012). That is, the first row represents the
situation in which a flower is sprayed with acid and dies; the
second row represents a situation in which a flower is not
sprayed with acid and dies for some other reason, and the
third row represents a situation in which a flower is not
sprayed with acid and lives. The model theory rules out
those situations in which the flower is sprayed with acid and
does not die. Reasoners list those three possibilities above
for such assertions (Goldvarg & Johnson-Laird, 2001,
Experiment 1). However, maintaining three mental models
in memory can be difficult, and so the theory asserts that
reasoners tend to build mental models, i.e., models in
accordance with the principle of truth. The mental model of
the assertion concerns only the first possibility:

A
¬ A
¬ A
¬ A

bloom

The mental models of causes and enabling conditions are
precisely the same, e.g., the mental models of Event A
causes event B and Event A enables event B are:

death
death
¬ death

acid

bloom
¬ bloom
¬ bloom

Negative events and models of causation
We extend the model theory of causal reasoning with the
following principle:
The principle of negative events: reasoners interpret
absences and omissive causes as negative events by
tagging models of the antecedent with explicit
negations.

¬ C

Negative events are controversial concepts in philosophy,
because while positive events occur in a specific
spatiotemporal frame, negative events do not (Paul & Hall,
2013, p. 178). But negative events are viable in psychology,
because adduced evidence suggests that reasoners interpret
negations systematically (see Khemlani et al., 2012, for a
review). They may be detected as a result of a violation of
an expectation, or they may be interpreted by information
explicitly marking the negative event, as in examples (1)
and (2) above, or by using phrases such as, “Not doing X
causes Y”, and “The absence of X causes Y”, and “The lack
of X causes Y”.
The principle we posit distinguishes between omissive
causations, omissive enabling conditions, and omissive
prevention conditions. Consider the following assertion: Not
providing a flower with light causes it to die. The assertion
is similar to its causal counterpart above, except that it
concerns a negative event, and so the theory posits that its
fully explicit models are as follows:
¬ light
light
light

Finally, an omissive prevention condition holds for
assertions such as, The absence of light prevents a flower
from blooming. Its fully explicit models are:
¬ light
light
light

and its mental models are:
¬ light

death
death
¬ death

death

X
X
¬ X
¬ X
¬ X

In contrast, an omissive enabling condition, such as, Not
spraying a flower with acid enables it to bloom, refers to a
different set of possibilities:
¬ acid
¬ acid
acid

bloom
¬ bloom
¬ bloom

¬ A
¬ A
A

bloom

A
A
A
A
A

¬ B
B
¬ B
B
¬ B

¬ B
B
¬ B

In contrast, the model theory’s treatment of omissive causes
refers to the following models:

The mental models reveal that, just as in positive cases,
omissive causes are often conflated with omissive enabling
conditions, because the mental models of The absence of A
causes B and The absence of A enables B are identical,
namely:
¬ A

¬
¬
¬
¬

If we disregard the assumed anticipated cause, X, and
combine the redundant models, then the theory posits that
double prevention refers to the following possibilities:

The only possibility that renders the statement false is one in
which a flower is sprayed with acid and then blooms. The
assertion’s mental models are:
¬ acid

¬ bloom

The fully explicit models of omissive prevention
demonstrate a stark difference between the model theory
and the force theory. In the force theory, omissive causation
is equivalent to double prevention. The model theory does
not interpret omissive causation as double prevention, and
so, unlike the force theory, it need not commit to
assumptions about anticipated forces or entities not
mentioned in the premises. Moreover, omissive causation
and double prevention refer to distinct sets of models, i.e.,
they concern different relationships and allow for different
possibilities. We illustrate the difference using the jack and
car example introduced by Wolff et al. (2010). They
propose that a double prevention scenario can be interpreted
as follows: something prevents the jack from operating (X
prevents A), and the jack prevents the car from falling (A
prevents B). The Cartesian product of the two assertions
yields the following models:

The assertion accordingly refers to three situations: one in
which the flower gets no light and dies, one in which the
flower gets light and dies, and one in which the flower gets
light and does not die. Its mental models are similarly:
¬ light

¬ bloom
¬ bloom
bloom

¬ A
A
A

B

B
B
¬ B

The theory accordingly distinguishes between double
prevention, omissive causation, omissive enabling
conditions, and omissive prevention. It predicts that
reasoners should conflate causes and enabling conditions,
but that they do so in error. And it eschews the composition
and representation of causal forces as well as ancillary
assumptions of causal agents by interpreting omissions as
negated events.

So the model theory concurs with the prediction of the force
theory that reasoners often interpret omissive causes as
omissive enabling conditions. However, the model theory is
unique in classifying such interpretations as errors. In other
words, the theory posits that a given causal assertion about
omission concerns a causal, an enabling, or else a
prevention relationship. Reasoners who conflate them do so
erroneously.

General discussion

References

Omissive causes vex both philosophers and psychologists,
and all but one of the extant psychological theories of
causation have not addressed the issue. We propose a new
model-based theory that interprets omissive causation (e.g.,
"The absence of breathing causes death") as causation in
which the antecedent is negated (e.g., "not breathing"). The
theory we posit distinguishes three sorts of omissive
relationship: omissive causation, omissive enabling
relations, and omissive prevention. Each of the three
relations refers to a set of fully-explicit models, but
reasoners often only represent one of those models: the
mental model. And so the theory predicts that while
reasoners can separate the different relations, they often
erroneously conflate omissive causal relationships and
omissive enabling conditions. Unlike alternative theories
based on the transmission of force (Wolff et al., 2010), the
model theory posits that individuals reason on the basis of
discrete representations, and that they do not interpret
omissive causation as double prevention.
Given the diverging predictions of the two theories, it is
imperative to test between them in future studies. We
identify three potential empirical approaches for
adjudicating between the two theories. First, the model
theory assumes that people represent absent and omissive
causes as negative events, and so reasoners should treat
negative events as being part of a spatiotemporal frame.
They happen in a particular representational context: the act
of "not spraying a flower with acid" reduces to a symbolic
negation of "spraying a flower with acid", and so the
negative event should inherit the same spatiotemporal frame
as the affirmative one.
Second, because the model theory states that the mental
models of omissive causes and omissive enabling
relationships are identical, reasoners should often fail to
distinguish between them. But in certain contexts, when
they are prompted to deliberate or consider all possibilities,
or else when their task is to consider counterexamples
(Frosch & Johnson-Laird, 2011), they should be able to
distinguish between omissive causes and enabling
conditions.
Finally, the model theory is not based on interpreting
causes as double preventions: both the mental models and
the fully explicit models of double prevention diverge from
the models of omissive causes. Reasoners should therefore
treat them both differently across a broad swathe of
inferential tasks.
