Abstract
Categorization, the process of grouping distinguishable entities into equivalence classes, is an essential component of human cognition. Although it has been often argued that selective
attention is an important component of categorization, organism with immature selective attention (such as human infants
or young children) exhibit the ability to learn categories. This
research addresses this apparent paradox by examining attention allocation in the course of category learning across development. Results suggest that while some young children are
able to attend selectively, adults more flexibly deploy selective
attention according to task demands.

Introduction
Categorization, the ability to group distinguishable objects
and ideas that share some important commonalities, is an essential component of cognition that supports the expansion
of knowledge through generalization, inference, and communication. Given the importance of this ability, it is important to understand the mechanisms that support it and the
way these mechanisms develop. Mechanisms of categorization involve an interesting paradox. On the one hand, the
ability to learn categories exhibits early onset (i.e., infants
as young as three months of age exhibit the ability to learn
categories (Oakes, Madole, & Cohen, 1991; Quinn, Eimas,
& Tarr, 2001). On the other hand, many models of categorization posit that selective attention plays a central role in
category learning (Kruschke, 1992). If this is the case, how
do organisms whose selective attention is immature (such as
human infants or young children) learn categories?
Adult-like categorization is thought to rely on selective attention, focusing on some aspects of the stimuli (presumably
the category-relevant ones) and ignoring others (presumably
irrelevant ones). At the same time, selective attention exhibits
protracted development (Plude, Enns, & Brodeur, 1994),
which perhaps is related to the slow development of the
brain structures sub-serving selective attention (Huttenlocher
& Dabholkar, 1997; Bunge & Zelazo, 2006). The slower development of those structures coupled with childrens ability
to learn categories, suggests that early category learning may
not depend on selective attention: children learn category
statistics as long as there is enough statistical structure in the
input and fail otherwise. This implies that during infancy and
childhood, the types of categories that can be learned will be
limited by the maturity of selective attention and by category
structure.

One hallmark of selective attention as a mechanism of mature categorization that is central to this investigation is attention optimization. Namely, as adults learn categories having a distinguishing characteristic, they will direct their attention more toward that feature and ignore the other features
(Hoffman & Rehder, 2010). In contrast, if young children
do not attend selectively when learning categories, then they
should exhibit reduced attention optimization compared to
adults. We tested this hypothesis with a supervised category
learning task, in which children and adults learned categories
while their gaze was tracked with an eye tracker. Since gaze is
linked to visual attention, eye tracking allowed us to measure
attention while participants learned novel visual categories.
A key issue alluded to above is that learning and attention
may be affected by category structure. For example, the category of living things contains quite varied members, and classifying something as living or non-living requires looking beyond one or two highly varying surface features (such as color
and shape) and focusing on key characteristics (reproduction,
energy consumption). In contrast, the category of dogs contains members with many strongly correlated features. Therefore, it may be the case that attention optimization will depend on the category structure. To address this question, we
systematically manipulated the category structure in our task
to investigate what role, if any, category structure plays in
modulating attention.
In summary, a growing body of literature has implicated
selective attention as a key mechanism of human categorization. We hypothesize that early categorization does not rely
strongly on selective attention, since executive function continues maturing through childhood. To foreshadow, our results suggest that while some children do exhibit selective attention, adults show a greater reliance on selective attention
for more difficult categorization tasks.

Method
Participants
Fifty-seven five-year-olds ( twenty-four female and thirtythree male, M = 5.26 years, SD = .44 years) participated in
this study. Children completed either the standard (N = 31) or
gaze contingent (N = 26) condition. Children were recruited
through local daycares or preschools located in Columbus,
Ohio, and public birth records. Ninety-nine adults (48 female and 51 male) participated in the study for course credit
through The Ohio State University research experience pro-

correspond to color and shape at position one, respectively. In
the highly and less separable conditions, each feature could
take on one of two values, denoted by 0 or 1. Category A was
primarily associated with feature 0, while category B was associated with feature 1. For variable categories, all features
except the deterministic took on four values, denoted by 0,1,2
or 3. Category A was primarily associated features 0 and 1,
while category B was associated with features 2 and 3. Deterministic features are in bold.

Stimuli
Categories were artificial tree-like objects with six spatially
separated branches that differed along the dimensions of color
and shape, as shown in Figure 1. This resulted in twelve features over 6 locations. We varied the feature values to construct six category types that were grouped into three pairs
having category structures that complemented each other.
The pairs were (1) highly separable (HS), (2) less separable
(LS), or (3) highly separable with high variance (HS+V).
Every category had a deterministic color and shape at a single position that perfectly determined category membership,
and ten less informative probabilistic color and shape features
over five positions. The position of the deterministic feature
varied between blocks so that participants would have to relearn the deterministic feature on subsequent blocks. In the
HS conditions, 2 of the 10 probabilistic features took values
from the contrasting category. In the LS condition, 4 of the
10 probabilistic features took values from the contrasting categories. In the high variance condition, probabilistic features
could take 2 possible values within each category, increasing
within category variance. Some example structures are shown
in Table 1.

child participants sat approximately 60cm from the 17” display within a quiet testing room. Adults sat alone, with
an experimenter in an adjacent room controlling the experiment and communicating with the participant via microphone. Children had an additional experimenter sit beside
them in the testing room to keep them on task and encourage
them throughout the study.
On each block, participants were told that they would see
a sequence of objects from two new categories. They were
asked to look at the object, then categorize it as fast and accurately as possible to obtain the most points. The categories
were associated with a target (small light or dark house) on
either the left or right side of the display. Each trial began
with a central fixation point. Once that orienting target was
fixated, an experimenter initiated the presentation of a central
category exemplar from one of the two groups that subtended
approximately 19 × 19 degrees of visual angle, and two targets on either side of the target. Participants had no time limit,
and made their classification decision by looking at the target
on the left or right side of the display that was associated with
the category. Corrective feedback was immediately given in
the form of a centrally displayed smiling face for correct answers, and a neutral face for incorrect answers. Participants
could look at the feedback screen as long as they wanted to,
and engaged the next trial by fixating the bottom of the dis-

play. There were 50 trials in each of the three blocks.
Children conducted a similar procedure, with slight modifications for their age. Namely, they were told that the two
different types of creatures needed help finding their home
(either the light house or dark house). Instead of making their
decision by looking at the corresponding target, they were
asked to yell out ”light house” or ”dark house” to indicate
where the stimulus went, and the experimenter recorded the
response. In addition, the feedback screen for incorrect trials showed the exemplar beside the correct target without a
neutral face. Correct trials ended with the exemplar near the
correct target in addition to a central smiling face. There were
20 trials in each of the three blocks.

Accuracy

Gaze Contingent (GC) Experiment Although eyetracking offers a measure of attention over learning, it has
drawbacks. Namely, it is possible for participants to attend
covertly during a task. Indeed, as we will show, adults in
the standard task performed expertly without fixating any
category defining features on about half of the trials. This
demonstrates that adults were, at least sometimes, attending
peripherally. To address this, we created a gaze contingent
version of the study where features were occluded until
fixated.
On each trial for adult participants, the six areas containing
the category features were covered in black except for central
white dots. Participants were told that the objects were occluded, and that they could look at the white dots to uncover
the objects. During the experiment, a 300ms fixation within
a box bounding a feature caused the feature to appear and
remain visible for the remainder of the trail.
In the child version, the features were occluded by blue
clouds that disappeared to show the covered feature when fixated. In addition, we increased the number of trials from
twenty to thirty and eliminated the HS+V categorization
block for children. As we will show in the next section, children had a difficult time learning the high variance categories.
Eliminating that structure reduced fuss-out in children, and
increased the proportion of participants who achieved the
learning criterion.

Results
It was important to ensure that participants were engaged in
and understood the task, so we only analyzed data for participants who reached a learning criterion of 10 correct trials within 11 consecutive trials within a block. For 20 trials (the child condition), this corresponds to p = 0.054 (
binomial(10, N = 11, θ = 0.5) ∗ 10 ). Since each block contained different category structures, we considered each block
separately according to the category type. We break down
the number of participants who achieved the criterion out of
the number that completed the minimum trials required to
achieve the learning criterion by category and age group in
Table 2. Mean trials to criterion are summarized in Table 3.
We show the percentage of trials with no fixations at the category features (missing gaze trials) in Table 4.

We first consider overall trends in accuracy and learning rates
as a function of category type. We plot the normalized distributions of trials to learning criterion, and the mean participant
accuracy for the first 20 trials in Figures 2 A and B, respectively. The first 20 trials are considered since this was the
maximum trials encountered by children for each category
type in the Non-GC condition. Figure 2 shows that while
most participants who learned did so within the first five trials, some children (and adults) required at least 19 trials to
achieve the learning criterion. Therefore, more children in
the GC versus Non-GC condition met the learning criterion
because of the additional 10 trials in that condition.
We then investigated whether there were systematic differences in accuracy, as a function of age group, category type,
and experiment condition. Given the amount of participants
who did not achieve the learning criterion for all category
types, analysis was conducted using mixed-effect modeling
which has the advantage of dealing with missing values, as
opposed to repeated measures ANOVA. Accuracies were exponential transformed to be closer to Normally distributed.
We first considered overall differences in accuracy between
the age groups. Specifically, we modeled transformed accuracy as having a main factor of age group (Adult/Child) and a
random factor of participant, and found no significant difference (B = 0.016, SE = 0.046,t(165.74) = 0.36, p = 0.72).
We then looked within age groups to find differences in
accuracy as a function of category type. We modeled the
transformed adult accuracy as having main factors and interactions of category type (HS/LS/HS+V) and condition (NonGC/GC) and a random factor of participant. We found no
significant main effect of condition, but a significant interaction between condition and the category type. We compared
this model (BIC: 165.49) to a simpler model (BIC: 154.41)
with only a main factor of category type and random factor of
participant, and found no improvement with the more complex model (χ2 = 5.75(3), p = 0.12). Therefore we used the
simpler model in the analysis. We found a significant difference for HS versus LS (B = −0.098, SE = .044,t(172.51) =
−2.25, p = .026), indicating a reduced accuracy for the LS
category versus the HS. We found no other significant differences (all ps > 0.14).
We modeled child transformed accuracies similarly to
adults, with main factors and interactions for category type

and condition, and a random factor for participant. We found
no significant main effect or interaction with condition (all
ps > .07), so we used a simpler model that included category
as a main factor and participant as a random factor. We found
a significant main effect of HS versus LS (B = 0.14, SE =
.062,t(21.31) = 2.20, p = .039), indicating an increased accuracy for the LS versus HS category. We found no other
significant differences (all ps > 0.31).
Overall, children and adults performed equally well. However, there was an interesting developmental difference,
where adults were more accurate for the HS categories versus
the LS categories while children showed the reverse trend.
Adults had the expected trend, given the the relative ease of
categorizing the HS categories with either the deterministic
or probabilistic features. We propose two possibilities for
the unexpected child result. First, it is possible that there
was a sampling bias, where more children completed and
learned the HS categories, but a smaller set of skilled category learners completed the LS task. The results of Table
2 do not give much support for this, since there were equal
proportions of children who learned HS and LS categories
(χ2 = 0.0011(1), p = 0.97). Another possibility is that children may have learned the LS categories faster. We ruled
this out by finding no significant effect of category type when
modeling the trial to learning criterion with main factor of
category type and random factor of participant (all ps > .14).
We will return to this issue after considering attention during
learning.

Attention Optimization
Recall that our goals are to investigate (1) whether children
would optimize attention in the course of category learning, and (2) if category structure modulates attention. Categories were defined by the twelve feature values at the six
positions, so our areas of interest (AOI) were six circular
non-overlapping regions centered at the feature positions that
completely contained the category defining features. Given a

Figure 2: Figure A shows normalized histograms of the trials
to learning criterion. The y-axis denotes the proportion of
participants who learned by a given number of trials, while
the x-axis denotes the number of trials required to achieve

category structure with two deterministic features at a single
AOI that are perfectly associated with the category type, the
optimal strategy is to look at just the deterministic features in
order to categorize the object perfectly on every trial. Thus,
our measure of attention optimization was the proportion of
fixations to the deterministic features as a function of trial
number.
Fixation positions were recorded online by the EyeLink
system, then processed offline using custom MATLAB and
Python software. Proportion of fixations to the deterministic feature was calculated as the number of fixations within
the deterministic AOI divided by the total number of fixations within all AOIs. Fixations outside of the six AOIs were
omitted from all analyses, trials without fixations at any AOIs
were treated as missing data for the optimization analyses,
and only accuracy information on those trials was used.
To determine the extent of attention optimization for each
category type as a function of trial number, it was crucial
to align participants with respect to the trial in which they
learned the categories. This accounts for differences in learn-

2006

ing rates and allows us a better measure of group optimization behavior. We denote the first trial in the sequence where
participants reach the learning criterion as T 0, and aligned
participants with respect to this trial to create optimization
curves. Optimization curves are shown in Figure 3.
For the Non-GC condition, the interpolated mean plot
shows some increase in the proportion of fixations at the deterministic feature for the LS and HS categories for both children and adults. Recall that the LS categories contain less
reliable probabilistic features, so more looks toward the deterministic feature would be advantageous. The HS categories,
on the other hand, show a slight decrease from the initial proportion of deterministic fixations by the end of the task.
For the GC condition, the interpolated mean plots show an
increasing proportion of fixations at the deterministic AOI,
beginning slightly before T 0 and persisting for several trials,
for all category types and age groups. This means that on average, participants more frequently fixated the deterministic
features than probabilistic features as they gained experience
categorizing the objects - an indicator of attention optimization. The peak in deterministic looks occurred several trials
after T 0, indicating that attention optimization occurs after
participants learn the category and replicating a trend found
in another eye tracking categorization study (Rehder & Hoffman, 2005). These results, taken together, suggest that at least
some adults and children optimized attention during the task.
Of interest, however, is: (1) whether there are developmental
differences in the proportion who optimize, and (2) the role
of category structure.
To analyze individual differences in attention optimization
behavior, for each participant we determined the change in
the average proportion of deterministic AOI looks before to
after T 0. Positive values denote an average increase in the
proportion of looking at the deterministic feature after T 0,
indicating attention optimization. We plot those results in
Figure 4 to compare trends across age groups and category
types.
For adults in Non-GC condition, trends shows increased
attention optimization for the two more difficult categories
(LS and HS+V), and there was a marginally significant effect of category type on the proportion who increased deterministic looks ( χ2 = 5.75(2), p = 0.056 ). Further investigation showed that the effect was driven by difference between
the HS and other groups: HS versus LS (χ2 = 4.76(1), p =
0.029), HS versus HS+V (χ2 = 5.31(1), p = 0.021), LS versus HS+V (χ2 = 0.026(1), p = 0.87). For the children in
Non-GC condition, there was no significant difference in the
proportion or participants who increased deterministic looks
between categories (χ2 = 0.098(2), p = 0.95). For adults
in the GC condition, Figure 4 shows an advantage for the
LS categories, but we found no significant differences between the proportion who increased deterministic looking
(χ2 = 2.72(2), p = 0.26). For children in the GC condition, there was no significant difference between HS and LS
groups (χ2 = 0.11(1), p = 0.74).

- especially when category structure consists of few deterministic dimensions. Children, although sometimes attending
like adults, did not optimize attention with respect to category
structure.

and Non-GC conditions, then compared the proportion who
increased deterministic fixations in the adult versus child
groups. For the HS category, there was a significantly larger
proportion in the child group who increased deterministic fixations (χ2 = 4.45(1), p = 0.035). We found no significant
difference for the LS category.
Taken together, these results suggest that when probabilistic features were less reliable (LS/HS+V), adults optimized
attention to a greater extent. When a time cost was introduced
for viewing features (GC), the differential effect diminished
and adults optimized attention across category type. Children also exhibited attention optimization that exceeded that
of adults for the easily separable categories - perhaps explaining their improved accuracy for the LS versus HS categories.
However, the proportion of optimizers was not affected by
category structure or by the experiment condition.

General Discussion
From these results we can point to two key findings. First,
adults are excellent at attending covertly, and did not fixate
any AOIs on about half of trials in the Non-GC condition.
Children, on the other hand, were much more consistent in
fixating AOIs in the Non-GC condition, but the reason is unclear. More importantly, we found a developmental change
in selective attention, where children about 5 years old did
not optimize attention according to the category structure instead exhibiting a kind of baseline attentional pattern. Unlike with children, adult attention optimization depended on
category structure. Namely, shifting to perfectly deterministic category features increased as other probabilistic features
became less reliable. These results taken together imply a
clear reliance on selective attention in adult categorization

Categorization exhibits early onset, and is central to intelligent behavior. However, it is not clear whether the mechanisms of category learning undergo developmental change.
Specific to our investigation was whether children rely on selective attention when learning categories, and how attention
is modulated by category structure. We found evidence that
selective attention plays a diminished role in child category
learning versus adults. Specifically, while children learned
categories as well as adults (no difference in accuracy), unlike adults, children showed no change in attention profiles as
probabilistic category features became less reliable for specifying category membership - instead showing a baseline level
of attention optimization. We hypothesize that these differences stem from immature executive functioning in children.
Overall, the study gives new insight into category learning
and discrimination in childhood, and the role of selective attention in early categorization.
