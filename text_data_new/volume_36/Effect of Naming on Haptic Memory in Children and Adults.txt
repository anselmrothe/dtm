Abstract

Brearton, & Mannea, 2011). Findings revealed that odor
naming enhanced memory only when cued during encoding
and retrieval. Specifically, consistently naming the same
odor during encoding and retrieval was related to almost
perfect recognition, while inconsistently naming an odor
was related to poor recognition. The same predictive value
of consistently naming on recognition found in adults was
also seen in children (Frank, Brearton, et al., 2011). This
outcome is surprising given extensive previous literature on
how poorly children are at odor naming accuracy (e.g.,
Lumeng, Zuckerman, Cardinal, & Kaciroti, 2005; MonneryPatris, Rouby, Nicklaus, & Issanchou, 2009; Stevenson,
Mahmut, & Sundqvist, 2007).
The generalizability of consistent naming to predict
memory performance found in odors among adults and
children have not been fully explored in other sensory
domains. The current study tests the relationship
between naming and memory by evaluating how
children and adults name and remember shapes during
haptic exploration.
Among children, previous research has shown that
children (ranging from 3 to 8 years old) could label
common
haptic
objects
with
75%
accuracy
(Morrongiello, Humphrey, Timney, Choi, & Rocca,
1994). Furthermore, Bushnell & Baxt (1999) found that
5-year-old children were able to remember 16 familiar
and 16 unfamiliar objects averaging 15 correct for the
familiar objects and 13.5 for the unfamiliar objects. This
study did have one caveat in that the recognition
memory task did not have a retention interval between
the encoding and retrieval phases as in the previous odor
studies. The current study investigates whether a similar
experimental design as in the olfactory studies would
have the same results among children and adults in terms
of the relationship between naming and recognition
memory performance.

Recollection of events can be improved with the use of active
strategies. In the current study, we examined if naming could
serve as a mnemonic device for both children and adults to
remember shapes that they explored haptically. Participants
either named the shape during the encoding phase (naming
condition), or they determined the “likability” of the shape
(liking condition). During the retrieval phase, participants had
to trace shapes again. Here, the task was to name each shape
and to determine whether they remember tracing it
previously. Results showed that memory performance was
significantly better for adults than for children. More
importantly, while there was no difference in memory
performance between conditions, naming consistency was
found to be the best individual predictor of correct
recognition memory performance. Findings are discussed in
the context of the developmental similarity and differences
between haptic and olfactory memory.

Introduction
The influence of odor names to aid olfactory recognition has
been debated repeatedly, with some researchers
demonstrating its memory enhancing effects (Cain & Potts,
1996; Larsson, 1997; Lehrner, Gluck, & Laska, 1999; Rabin
& Cain, 1984), while others did not (Engen & Ross, 1973;
Lawless & Cain, 1975; Møller, Wulff, & Köster, 2004; Parr,
White, & Heatherbell, 2004). These studies varied on how
odor names were cued during the encoding (i.e., free
naming, forced-choice labeling), and they varied in the time
when the odor names were cued (i.e., during encoding,
retrieval, or both).
A series of recent studies sought to shed light on such
discrepant findings and manipulated the frequency and
difficulty of odor naming variables (Frank, Brearton,
Rybalsky, Cessna, & Howe, 2011; Frank, Rybalsky,

To summarize, the current study assessed the relation
between naming a shape explored haptically and
remembering it afterwards. If haptic memory mimics
olfactory memory, participants should benefit from
providing consistent names during encoding and retrieval.
Preschoolers and elementary-school children participated, as
well as adults. For control purposes, a condition was added
in which naming occurred only during retrieval, not
encoding. Furthermore, we manipulated the familiarity of
shapes, as a way of exploring the development of haptic
memory. Unfamiliar shapes are likely to mimic odors that
are very difficult to name.

odors are very difficult to name. Table 1 has a list of all
familiar and unfamiliar shapes used.

The study had a 3 x 2 x 2 mixed design, with age group and
condition as the independent-group factors, and shape type
as the within-group factor. Condition pertained to whether
participants had to generate a label for the shapes they
encounter during encoding (naming condition) or not (liking
condition). Shape type pertained to whether the shape was
familiar or unfamiliar.

Participants
Children (N = 54) were recruited from public schools
serving urban and suburban Midwestern families with lower
to higher middle-class status. There were two age groups: 4to 5-year olds (N = 29; M = 5.30 years; 20 girls and 9 boys)
and 7- to 9-year olds (N = 26; M = 8.30 years; 9 girls and 17
boys). Adult participants (N = 30; M = 20.30 years) were
recruited either from the general public (2 women and 4
men; ranging in age from 16 to 32) or from the population
of college students attending the University of Cincinnati
(13 women and 11 men, ranging in age from 18 to 24).
Students received partial course credit for participation.

A wooden box (approximately 2 x 2 x 2 ft.) was created
to provide participants with a haptic experience of the
objects. The box was placed on its side and a 3” x 5”
opening was cut into the bottom of the box for an arm to
enter. Figure 3 shows the box from the experimenter’s point
of view. The shapes were attached to its walls and the
opening for the child’s hand was covered with pieces of felt.
A white cloth was draped in the middle of the box to make
it impossible for participants to see through the opening. A
strip of Velcro was placed in the inside of the box behind
the white cloth to hold in place each shape that was being
traced.

Test Apparatus and Stimuli
Stimuli were balsa-wood shapes (about 3.5 in2) glued on
fitted pieces of mat board (for durability). There were eight
familiar shapes (see Figure 1 for examples), and eight
unfamiliar shapes (see Figure 2 for examples).

2 common shapes)
Unfamiliar shapes were created by combining part of one
familiar shape with part of another familiar shape. The

or whether Penny would like the shape). Participants were
then given a five-minute break where they could color or
look through magazines.

Participants were tested individually with a female
experimenter, either in a quiet area of their school or in the
lab. The procedure consisted of a familiarization, an
encoding phase, and a retrieval phase. Familiarization and
encoding differed as a function of condition (liking vs.
naming), while retrieval was identical for all participants.
Each phase is described in detail below.

Retrieval Phase
The instructions were: “Okay, now that the break is over,
let’s trace some more things”. In the liking condition,
participants are given the same familiarization that was used
for naming condition. Then all participants were told: “I
want you to give me a name for each shape, and I then want
you to tell me if you remember tracing each shape from
earlier. Ready? Go!” Responses were recorded again.

Familiarization
A cover story was used that involved “Penny the Poodle”, a
fictional character who needs help tracing things.
Specifically, as a way of practice, the experimenter brought
out a circle and demonstrated tracing by dragging two
fingers along the edge of the shape. The experimenter then
asked the participant to mimic this action too. The
participant was then told: “In this game, we are not going to
be able to see any of the things that we trace. You are going
to trace all of them inside of this box. Penny does not want
you to see the things in this game. Try to make sure the
curtains are down, and I’ll make sure too, and no peeking”.
The experimenter put a triangle on the Velcro strip in the
middle of the box and asks the participant to place his/her
hand inside of the box and trace the shape. After five
seconds of tracing the participant is asked to remove his/her
hand from the box. In the naming condition, the instructions
were: “Can you give a name for the thing you just traced?”
Feedback was provided (i.e., in the case of an incorrect
response, the experimenter said: “Great name, but for now,
we’re going to call this a triangle”). The experimenter than
explained that some of the shapes are not going to be easy to
name. The experimenter showed the participant half of an
arrow and said: Some things are hard to name, like this one.
What name would you give this?” The participant is told the
name can be anything that is a real name. If the participant
was hesitant, a prompt was given: “Well, just come up with
a name, it can be anything you want to call it. You could
call it an arrow, a tree, a stick, anything…just not a person’s
name like Fred!” The experimenter then showed half of a
heart and repeated the process.
For the liking condition, the participant was asked to
decide whether Penny likes the traced shape or not.
Specifically, the participant was told: “Penny likes things
with many corners. Do you think Penny would like the thing
you just traced? Be creative! It’s up to you to decide if she
will like it!” If the participant was hesitant, the experimenter
repeated the tracing procedure and pointed out the corners.

Results
Naming accuracy for each shape was determined to be
correct if the participant correctly used one of the shape
names from Table 1. No partial credit was given for close
hits, e.g., calling the “oval” shape as a “circle”. Naming
consistency was determined as being consistent if the same
shape name was used during both encoding and retrieval.
Naming consistency could only be determined for the
naming condition, given that this is the only condition in
which naming occurred twice.
Figure 4 shows memory performance as a function of
condition and age group. Proportion memory correct is the
sum of both hits and correct rejections. A proportion of 0.5
is chance performance.

age group. The errors bars represent standard errors.

Encoding Phase
Participants were told: “Now you are ready to play the
game. There are many different things you must trace like
we did before, but this time I will not show you any of
them. Do your best and try to remember them!” Participants
were reminded to not peek. The experimenter placed each
shape on the middle Velcro strip, using one of two random
orders. Participants’ responses were recorded manually
(depending on condition, either the name given to the shape,

A logistic regression and a generalized linear model were
utilized to assess the relationship between consistent naming
and naming accuracy to predict recognition (for a detailed
explanation into the reasons why these analysis and
modeling techniques were chosen over an ANOVA, see
Cessna & Frank, 2013; Frank, Brearton, et al., 2011; Frank,
Rybalsky, et al., 2011). The generalized estimating equation
(GEE) program of SPSS (v.22) was used for the analyses
with the exchangeable covariance structure assumed. The

New Shapes Analyses

different shapes were considered a repeated measure in each
model that analyzed each memory response as an individual
response. The predictor variables were determined to be
significant based on their Wald chi-square values.
First, a GEE analysis was conducted to assess if age
group and condition would predict correct recognition. As
hypothesized, the analysis revealed that age group has a
significant effect on memory performance [Wald χ2 (2) =
42.25, p < 0.001]; however, condition did not [Wald χ2 (1) =
0.71, p = 0.40]. Post hoc LSD tests showed that adults
performed significantly better than both of the children
groups (all p < 0.001), while the 4- to 5-year olds were not
significantly different from the 7- to 9-year olds (p > 0.05).

Prior to any modeling, the three age groups were each
analyzed on correct recognition memory performance for
both correct and incorrect naming during retrieval instead of
naming consistency. Furthermore, since both conditions had
the participants name each shape during retrieval, both
conditions were also included. The results revealed that
correct recognition memory performance improved from the
younger children group to the adults in terms of naming
accuracy. Furthermore, the data suggests that naming
condition may be slightly better than the liking condition
(see Table 4).

for the old shapes. R refers to shape naming during retrieval.

Old Shapes Analyses
To inspect how naming consistency impacted memory
performance, the three age groups were each analyzed on
correct recognition performance for both consistent and
inconsistent shape naming. The results clearly demonstrate
that both the adult and older children groups were correct
about 9 out of 10 times on memory performance when they
were consistent in shape naming. Interestingly, the younger
children group was similar in terms of memory performance
when they were consistent or inconsistent in shape naming
(see Table 2).

Table 4: The relationship between correct recognition and
naming accuracy across age groups for the new shapes in
the naming condition.

A series of GEE analyses were conducted using the old
shapes only. The shape stimuli, age group, naming accuracy
(during retrieval), and naming consistency were selected as
predictors for correct memory performance, and the best
models were recorded in Table 3. The best model was
chosen based on the minimized corrected quasi-likelihood
under independence model criterion (QICC) value. The best
model for predicting correct recognition memory
performance for old stimuli was using both shapes [Wald χ2
(7) = 23.39, p < 0.001] and consistency [Wald χ2 (1) =
18.14, p < 0.001] as predictors. Note: consistency [Wald χ2
(1) = 28.79, p < 0.001] as a predictor by itself was the
second best model as its QICC value was only slightly
higher (thus inferior) than the best model.

Discussion

naming accuracy (during retrieval) were selected as
predictors for memory performance, and the best models
were recorded in Table 5. The best model for predicting
correct recognition memory performance for new stimuli
was age group [Wald χ2 (2) = 35.12, p < 0.001] as the only
predictor. Note: naming accuracy during retrieval as a
predictor was not even close to being the best predictive
model (see Table 5). The main reason why naming accuracy
was not a bigger factor in predicting memory performance is
simply that naming accuracy was almost zero for the
unfamiliar shapes (only one participant correctly name a
shape) (see Table 6).

The results of the current study illustrated a strong relation
between shape naming consistency and correct recognition,
similar to what was seen in previous studies of olfaction
(Cessna & Frank, 2013; Frank, Rybalsky, et al., 2011) and
flavor (Frank, Brearton, et al., 2011). Interestingly, when
comparing the different age groups of the current study to
the comparable age groups in Frank, Brearton, and
colleagues (2011) flavor research, the effects of naming
consistency and correct memory performance is as strong.
Again, as reported previously (Cessna & Frank, 2013;
Frank, Brearton, et al., 2011; Frank, Rybalsky, et al., 2011),
the data suggest that participants utilized a naming strategy
in which an “old” recognition memory response was stated
when participants had previously named the same shape
name during both encoding and retrieval phases of testing
and a “new” recognition memory response was used when
they had not previously named the shape during the
encoding phase. One caveat in the current study is that the
younger age group (4-5 year olds) showed weaker evidence
that naming consistency predicts correct memory
performance than was found previously with flavors (e.g.,
Frank, Brearton, et al., 2011). In fact, for being consistent or
inconsistent, they had a correct memory performance of
74% and 63%, respectively. With memory performance for
both consistently and inconsistently named shapes being
above chance of 50%, these results may suggest that
children from the age of 4-5 years old were not employing
the logic that if they named a shape by the same name in
encoding and retrieval, then it was sufficient to be an old
shape on the memory task.
Unlike previous studies where sensory stimuli were used
(e.g., Lumeng et al., 2005; Rabin & Cain, 1984), the current
study used unfamiliar shapes that were almost impossible to
name in comparison to the familiar shapes. These previous
studies did show that unfamiliar stimuli were more difficult
to name than familiar stimuli; however, the current study
assumed that the participants would be able to realize that
the unfamiliar shapes were just two familiar shapes cut in
half and put together. The data suggested that this
assumption was not true and that participants were more
likely to name the unfamiliar shape by only one of the half
shapes, e.g., naming the Dog Bone-Rectangle shape as just
Dog Bone. This outcome could mean that either participants
did not have enough time to properly identify this complex
haptic stimuli (they could only touch the shape for 5
seconds) or they were more focused to naming the shape as
a whole rather than its parts.
The current study demonstrates again the importance of
naming consistency to predict recognition when the naming
occurred in both the encoding and retrieval phases.
Recently, Cessna and Frank (2013) discovered that the
relationship between the predictive value of the naming
consistency and correct recognition memory performance in
odorants were dependent on the temporal placement of the
naming task when paired with the recognition memory task.
They found that the effects of consistent naming were

substantially weakened when memory performance
occurred completely separate from the two naming phases.
The data suggest that the participants were using the odor
names to decide their recognition memory response. Since
the effect of naming consistency was found to be as strong
as a predictor with haptic stimuli as seen with olfactory
stimuli, future research should attempt to completely
separate the memory task from the shape naming task to see
if the predictive value is also substantially weakened.
