Abstract

nouns), verb acquisition is more difficult, thus slower, than
noun acquisition1 .
Recent research (Bowerman, 2005; Duvignau et al., 2007;
Gaume, Duvignau, Prévot, & Desalle, 2008) has discovered
two salient patterns in the verb productions of young children: (a) verbs that, although semantically close to the expected conventional verb, don’t match the labelled action on
at least one of their semantic components (b) verbs that expect generic categories on their semantic components: many
objects fit in such categories.

We propose a model to compute two measurements of semantic efficiency of verbs as action labels. It is based on the exploration of the specific structure of synonymy networks of
verbs. We use these measurements to analyse and compare the
semantic efficiency of [Children/Adults] productions in action
labelling tasks, in French and Mandarin. The combination of
these two measurements leads to a generic score of semantic
efficiency, Skillex. Assigned to participants of the Approx protocol experiment, this score enables us to accurately classify
them into Children and Adults categories, be they French or
Mandarin native speakers.
Keywords: lexical acquisition, lexical networks, action labelling.

Lexical networks
A graph2 is defined by a set of vertices V and a symmetric
relation E ⊆ PV2 (the set of 2-element sets of V ).When V is a
set of lexical units and E a lexical relation (e.g. synonymy,
co-occurrence...), the graph G = (V, E) is called a lexical
network. The past decade has seen several works (Gaume,
2004; Gaume et al., 2008; Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005; De
Deyne & Storms, 2008a; Morais, Olsson, & Schooler, 2013)
that show that most lexical networks, as most terrain networks3 , are Hierarchical Small World Networks (HSWN), insofar as they share similar properties (Watts & Strogatz, 1998;
Barabasi & Réka, 1999; Newman, 2003; Gaume, Mathieu, &
Navarro, 2010):
• p1 : Low density (not many edges)
• p2 : Short paths (the average number L of edges of the
shortest path between two vertices is low)
• p3 : High clustering rate C (locally densely connected
subgraphs can be found whereas the whole graph is globally sparse in edges)
• p4 : Degree Distribution akin to a power law4 .

Introduction
Most research on lexical acquisition of action verbs shows
that, in order to label actions, young children produce action
verbs that are semantically less efficient than adults’ones.
In this article, we tackle this issue in a different way. Instead of using psycholinguistic criteria (specificity, conventionality, imageability . . . ) to evaluate how efficient a verb is
to label an action , we automatically compute the semantic
efficiency of verbs by mapping the semantics of labelled actions onto a synonymy network of verbs and by exploring the
specific structure of such a lexical network.
Thus, we propose a model to compute a generic score of
semantic efficiency, called Skillex, which combines two other
efficiency measurements, Prox and Deg. Assigned to participants of the Approx protocol experiment, Skillex accurately
categorizes them into the two [Young Children/Adults] age
groups, be they French or Mandarin native speakers.
First, state of the art research about semantic acquisition of
action verbs and current work on lexical networks are briefly
reviewed. Then we detail our model and its evaluation, on the
basis of the Approx protocol. The last section is devoted to
the conclusion.

Semantic Acquisition of action verbs

In this paper we focus on 2 synonymy graphs :
• A French dictionary graph of verbs: GF = (VF , EF ) is
a graph of the verbs extracted from DicoSyn5 : there is an

From works of Bowerman (1974), Schaefer (1979) and
Gentner (1982) to recent research (Bowerman, 2005; HirshPasek & Golinkoff, 2006; Duvignau, Fossard, Gaume, Pimenta, & Elie, 2007; Imai et al., 2008), action verbs acquisition dynamics have consistently been shown to be distinct
from object nouns acquisition dynamics. This difference can
be explained by the genuinely relational nature of verb predicates, which strongly constrains the categories of the units
they put in relation. Since, in addition, many verb predicates
induce categories that are not natural (contrary to most object

1 On this issue, note also the perspectives of Tardif (1996); Choi
and Gopnik (1995).
2 Here we only consider undirected graphs.
3 Terrain networks are networks that model real data, for example in sociology, linguistics or biology. They contrast with artificial
networks (deterministic or random).
4 Although Morais et al. (2013) showed that the distribution is
more correlated with a “power law with exponential cut-off” than
with a power law.
5 DicoSyn is a compilation of synonymy relations extracted
from seven other dictionaries (Bailly, Benac, Du Chazaud,
Guizot, Lafaye, Larousse and Robert).
DicoSyn was first

edge {A, B} if the verbs described by the vertices A and
B are synonyms in DicoSyn. GF is made symmetric and
reflexive.
• A Mandarin dictionary graph of verbs: GM = (VM , EM )
is a graph of verbs extracted from CilinCWN: a fusion
of Chinese WordNet (CWN)6 and a Chinese thesaurus
TongYiCi CiLin (Cilin)7 . Data was processed similarly to
the way GF was built.
Table 1 shows the typical HSWN properties of GF and GM
on their largest connected component. Our approach consists
in exploiting the HSWN properties of these synonymy networks. The two properties p3 and p4 are especially useful.

• 1.a Verbs produced by adults are more specific than those
produced by children
• 1.b Specific verbs’ degrees are low (p4 )
• 2.a Action verbs produced by children are less appropriate
to the labelled actions than those produced by adults
• 2.b In synonymy networks, verbs are brought closer if their
meanings are closely related (p3 ).
This model is based on two measures : (1) the degree of a
verb in a synonymy network and (2) a verb’s proximity to a
lexico-semantic zone of a synonymy network. In a verb synonymy graph G = (V, E), the degree of a verb v ∈ V , denoted
by deg(v)8 is its number of neighbours in the graph. A verb’s
proximity to a lexico-semantic zone, however, is a more complex measure, and will be detailed in the next section.

Consider G = (V, E), a verb synonymy graph with n = |V |
vertices and m = |E| edges, such that G is reflexive (any vertex is linked to itself). Consider a traveller randomly walking
along edges of the graph G, from vertex to vertex:
• At each moment t ∈ N the traveller is on a vertex ut ∈ V
• At time t + 1, the traveller reaches one neighbour of ut ,
randomly chosen with uniform probability.

Several research projects have demonstrated a relation between the structure of lexical networks and the lexical acquisition process. According to Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005),
in lexical networks built from the Roget’s thesaurus, WordNet and the USF word association norms (Nelson, McEvoy,
& Schreiber, 2004), vertex degrees are correlated with:
• the age of acquisition (AoA) of English words (Morrison,
Chappell, & Ellis, 1997)
• the frequency of occurrence of such words in English, itself correlated with their AoA (Kučera, Francis, Carroll, &
Twaddell, 1967).

This process is called a simple random walk on G, as described for example by (Bollobas, 2002). It is formally described by a Markov Chain on V , with a n × n transition probability matrix [G]:

 1 if {u, v} ∈ E,
(1)
[G] = (gu,v )u,v∈V , with gu,v = deg(u)

0 else.

These findings are confirmed by a study of De Deyne and
Storms (2008a), for the Dutch language, on the basis of the
graph extracted from the Dutch Word Association norms (De
Deyne & Storms, 2008b). The study also shows that both the
clustering coefficient in the word’s neighbourhood (distance
2) and its betweenness centrality (measure of the centrality of
a vertex in a graph) are correlated to its AoA.

Since G is reflexive, no vertex has a null degree, [G] is
therefore definite. By construction, [G] is stochastic: ∀u ∈
V, ∑v∈V gu,v = 1.
Let us define a lexico-semantic zone of the graph G by a
probability distribution ∆ on V , its vertex set (more details on
such a definition are given hereafter). After a given number
of steps t ∈ N, a random walker who started its walk from
the ∆ distribution, at a time t0 = 0, has a probabilistic location on V , described by the probability distribution ∆[G]t .
When the starting vertex (u) is known, the ∆u starting distribution is actually the probability 1 to be on vertex u. In that
case, the probability for the walker to be on a vertex v after t
steps is (δu [G]t )v = [G]tu,v . As in (Gaume, 2004), the PerronFrobenius theorem (Stewart, 1994) then helps us show that:
deg(v)
∀u, v ∈ V, lim (δu [G]t )v = lim [G]tu,v =

Model
Theoritical motivations of the model
Our model is motivated by the parallel between (a) experimental results on semantic acquisition of action verbs and
(b) our hypotheses on HSWN properties of synonymy networks (Duvignau, Gaume, & Nespoulous, 2004; Gaume et
al., 2008):
compiled at ATILF (Analyse et Traitement Informatique de la
Langue Française), before being corrected at CRISCO laboratory
(http://elsap1.unicaen.fr/dicosyn.html) (Ploux & Victorri, 1998).
6 Chinese WordNet is a lexical resource modelled on Princeton
WordNet, with many novel linguistic considerations for Chinese. It
is proposed and launched by Huang et al. (Huang, Chang, & Lee,
2004), at the time of writing it contains 28,815 synonyms.
7 The Tongyici Cilin (Mei, Zheng, Gao, & Yin, 1984) is a Chinese
synonym dictionary known as a thesaurus in the tradition of Roget’s
Thesaurus in English. It contains about 70000 lexical items.

This means that, as t grows to infinity, the probability of
being on a vertex v at time t does not depend on the starting
vertex, it becomes simply proportional to v’s degree. However, in the early stages of the walk, the probability distribution heavily depends on u, the starting vertex. When t is
8 deg(v) = |{u | {v, u} ∈ E}|.

• D(Wai ,x ) is the mean12 of the set {deg(v) | v ∈ Wai ,x ∩VL }
• P(Wai ,x ) is the mean of the set {prox(v, ∆Lai ) | v ∈ Wai ,x ∩VL }
• S(Wai ,x ) is the mean of the set {s(v, ∆Lai ) | v ∈ Wai ,x ∩VL }.

small, the vertices most probably reached by the walker are
vertices that are close to u, insofar as many short paths link
them to u9 . So, for a small t, the probability distribution is
a good indication of the closeness of two vertices in the network. In the following, we thus consider short random walks
with the fixed parameter t = 410 . We then define the proximity of a verb v ∈ V to a lexico-semantic zone defined by a
probability distribution ∆ by:
(∆[G]4 )v
(3)
prox(v, ∆) =
maxr∈V (∆[G]4 )r
For example, Table 2 provides the list of the 20 closest
French verbs11 to écorcer (to bark) in GF . (∆ = δecorcer , the
certainty to be located on écorcer).

These three figures are the basis on which we compute the
four scores of each participant x for the action category (e.g.
motion actions, breaking/cutting actions. . . ) defined by A:
• Productiveness score NA (x): mean of {|Wa,x | | a ∈ A}
• Degree score DA (x): mean of {D(Wa,x ) | a ∈ A and Wa ∩
VL 6= ∅}
• Prox score PA (x): mean of {P(Wa,x ) | a ∈ A and Wa ∩VL 6=
∅}
• Skillex score SA (x): mean13 of {S(Wa,x ) | a ∈ A}.

The Approx protocol (Méligne et al., 2011; Duvignau, Tran,
& Manchon, 2013) is, on average, completed by a participant
in 20 minutes, and enables us to compute a lexical performance score for each participant.
Material and Participants The material consists in seventeen 30-second action-films without speech, that show acts of
separation/deterioration of objects. In each film14 , a woman
alters an object with the help of her hands or with an instrument, explicitly showing an initial state and a final state .
In this paper we focus on 4 groups of participants, French
and Mandarin native speakers15 :
• CF : 74 French young children (2-5 years old)
• AF : 76 French young adults (18-40 years old)
• CM : 29 Mandarin young children (2-5 years old.
• AM : 60 Mandarin young adults (18-30 years old)
Procedure : The films are randomly shown to a participant. After each film, the experimenter asks the participant
what the woman did. Between each action film, a distractor
is shown to avoid perseveration effects. Results of participants who do not watch all 17 films are not taken into account. Lexical action labels are extracted from the elicited
responses, and lemmatized. Compound labels are split according to their components :
• simple verb + complement (e.g. to break into pieces → to
break + into pieces)
• simple verb + simple verb (e.g. to make broken → to make
+ to break)
• simple verb + result when the verb is a mandarin resultative
compound verb (Li & Thompson, 1981)(it is not useful in
French)

Efficiency of a verb
Let G = (V, E) be a verb synonymy graph, v ∈ V a verb and
∆a the probability distribution on V that delimits the meaning
of an action a. We define the efficiency of verb v in relation to
∆a by:
prox(v, ∆a )
s(v, ∆a ) =
(4)
deg(v)
Our model is based on the hypothesis that adults produce
verbs that have a better efficiency in relation to ∆a than the
efficiency of verbs produced by children to label the same action. The measures prox(v, ∆a ) and deg(v) both play a meaningful part in the efficiency in relation to the ∆a score :
• prox(v, ∆a ) : the greater the proximity of verb v to ∆a , the
more semantically appropriate the verb v is, to describe a
• deg(v) : the smaller the degree of verb v, the more specific
the verb v.

Four scores
This section details how our model attributes four scores
of lexical performance to each individual, given a language L, a graph GL = (VL , EL ), and a set of actions A =
{a1 , · · · , ai , · · · an }. Let ∆L = {∆La1 · · · , ∆Lai · · · , ∆L an } be the
lexico-semantic zones that correspond, in GL , to the actions
of A. Let x be an individual who produced a set of verbs Wai ,x
to label action ai .
For each verb set Wai ,x such that Wai ,x ∩VL 6= ∅, the following figures are computed:

Results

This procedure to record action labels both in French and
Mandarin enables us to compare the French and Mandarin
analyses reported hereafter.

Task 1 results We used an ANOVA to measure how
significant the difference between young children’s and
adults’ PROX scores is, and a non-parametric Man-WhitneyWilcoxon test to measure how significant the differences were
between the Productiveness, Degree and Skillex scores of
young children and adults18 .

From action-stimuli to lexico-semantic zones
In a graph (GF = (VF , EF ) for French and GM = (VM , EM )
for Mandarin), a lexico-semantic zone is the distribution of
probability that denotes, as objectively as possible, an actionstimulus of the protocol. To define this distribution (in
French), a mixed16 PopF sample of participants is gathered
by randomly choosing 25 participants from CF and 25 from
AF . For each action a, each verb v of VF is attributed the frequency f reqFa (v) with which it was used by participants of
PopF to label action a.
The probability distribution ∆Fa , on VF , then defines a’s
lexico-semantic zone in GF :

Task 1: Computing participant’s scores
Results show:
• A significant difference between the productiveness scores
of children and adults, both in French (W (150) = 4788;
p ≈ 0) and Mandarin (W (89) = 1046; p < .05)

We refer to the 17 action-stimuli of the protocol as A =
{a1 , · · · , ai , · · · , a17 }, and to their corresponding lexicosemantic zones as ∆F = {∆Fa1 · · · , ∆Fai · · · , ∆Fa17 }. Three scores
DA (x), PA (x) et SA (x) are computed for each native French17
speaker participant to the Approx protocol on the action category ”separation/deterioration of objects“ denoted by A.
In order to evaluate our model on the basis of this task,
we compare young children’s scores to scores of adult participants: a significant difference would mean that such scores
accurately discriminate the two age groups [Children/Adults].

• A significant difference between the degree scores of children and adults, both in French (W (150) = 5389; p ≈ 0)
and Mandarin (W (89) = 1243; p < .001)
• A significant difference between the Prox scores of children and adults, both in French (F(150) = 13.58; p < .001)
and Mandarin (F(89) = 79.41; p ≈ 0)

Task 2 : Automatic [Children/Adults] age group
categorization

• A significant difference between the Skillex scores of children and adults, both in French (W (150) = 5756; p ≈ 0)
and Mandarin (W (89) = 1670; p ≈ 0)

This task is detailed using the French case as a generic example, the exact same procedure is done for Mandarin. It
consists in measuring the accuracy of the automatic categorization of the two age groups CF and AF , on the basis of the
three scores computed in Task 1. With each of the 3 scores,
we use the k-means algorithm (k = 2) (Hartigan & Wong,
1979) to separate the set of participants into two categories.
When considering the Degree score, the category with the
greatest centroid is assigned to the young children category,
the other to the adults category. Conversely, when considering the Prox score or the Skillex score, the category with the
greatest centroid is assigned to the adults category, the other
to the young children category.
The accuracy of the automatic categorization is measured
by the agreement rate between the expected categories (CF
and AF ) and the score-computed categories.

The Productiveness, Degree, Prox and Skillex scores highlight a significant difference between the verb productions of
young children and of adults, upon a task that consists in labelling actions that show deteriorations or separations of objects, in both the Mandarin and French languages.
Task 2 results Task 2 aims to confirm that Task 1 results
are significant and consistent enough to enable automatic categorization of adults and children. It is evaluated by the rate
of agreement between automatically computed categories and
expected categories, which is measured with the Precision
and the Kappa of Cohen κ (Cohen, 1960):
• Precision is the observed agreement probability po
o −pe
• The κ is defined as : κ = p1−p
in which pe is the expected
e
agreement probability knowing (a) the distribution of individuals on the Adult and Child categories that were built
by the 2 − mean algorithm and (b) the distribution of individuals on the expected CF and AF groups.

16 So that lexico-semantic zones do not induce a bias towards the
adult or child age group.
17 The same three scores are computed for Mandarin speakers on
M

the basis of ∆M = {∆M

such lexical networks does not significantly vary. They exhibit similar degree distributions and clusters, which are common to most synonymy dictionaries of a given language, as
seen in (Gaillard, Gaume, & Navarro, 2011). The participant’s Skillex score computation, which relies on the hierarchical distribution of degrees and on the small world structure
of synonymy dictionaries, is therefore robust to resource variation.
We intend to further this initial study into three directions:
(a) to extend the analysis to other languages, with the long
term perspective of initiating a language typology of lexical
acquisition dynamics (i.e. with multilingual ressources like
Wiktionary19 ), (b) to extend the protocol to other action categories (for example verbs of movement) in order to compare
lexical acquisition dynamics across action types, and (c) to
extend the study to the analysis of pathologies:
Various stages of the Alzheimer’s disease (Joubert et al.,
n.d.). Building on works of Méligne et al. (2011) we formulate the two following hypotheses : On the basis of their Approx protocol verb production, participants can be attributed
a Skillex score that:
• (H1.1) will accurately categorize participants into two
[Moderate Alzheimer/Older without pathology] groups
• (H1.2) will NOT enable their accurate categorization
into two [Moderate Alzheimer/Child without pathology]
groups.
Asperger’s syndrome(Atwood, 1998). Building on works of
Maffre et al. (2012) we formulate the two following hypotheses : On the basis of their Approx protocol verb production,
participants can be attributed a Skillex score that:
• (H2.1) will accurately categorize participants into two
[Asperger child/Child without pathology] groups
• (H2.2) will NOT enable their accurate categorization into
two [Asperger Child/Adult without pathology] groups.

Table 3 suggests that the main component (degree or prox)
of the lack of efficiency in action labelling during lexical acquisition depends on the language to acquire: (a) whereas, in
Mandarin, the Prox score categorizes [Children/Adults] with
a substantial agreement (according to the scale of Landis and
Koch (1977), κ = .62), this is not the case in French (κ = .21);
(b) whereas, in French, the Degree score categorizes [Children/Adults] with an almost perfect agreement (κ = .81), this
is not the case in Mandarin (κ = .17).
In fact, the Skillex score is the only score able to highlight
differences of semantic efficiency of action labelling between
children and adults independently from the language. It is
the only score that accurately categorizes participants into the
two [Children/Adults] age groups in both languages (almost
perfect agreement). Furthermore, the Skillex score’s agreement rates are better than these of (a) in French, the degree
score D (Precision:+5%; κ:+14%) and (b) in Mandarin, the
proxemy score P (Precision:+8%; κ:+29%).

Conclusion
The Approx protocol is directly applicable to different languages and participant samples (adults, children, participants
with pathologies . . . ). It enables researchers to gather meaningful linguistic data that can be used to comparatively analyse languages and participant types.
Moreover, although this study only focuses on the two
dictionary-based graphs GF et GM , results do not significantly
vary with the dictionary on which score computations are
based. In fact, despite significant local variations that reflect
the differences between dictionaries, the overall structure of
18 Since, according to the Shapiro-Wilk test, the distribution of the
Productiveness, Degree and Skillex scores are not normal distributions, ANOVA was not applicable.
