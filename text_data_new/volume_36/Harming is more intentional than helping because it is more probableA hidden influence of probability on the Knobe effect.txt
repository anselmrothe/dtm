Abstract
Knobe (2003) demonstrated that people’s intentionality
judgments in side effects depend on the outcome of the sideeffect, indicating that people’s judgments of intentionality of
action depend on not only the intention of the actor but also
on the result of the action. However, on the basis of findings
in judgment and decision making (e.g., Harris, Corner, &
Hahn, 2009), the current study proposes another hypothesis to
Knobe’s (2003) results: the participants’ intentionality
judgments depended on the probabilities of outcomes
provided by the action, rather than on the outcomes itself. To
test this hypothesis, the present study employed an identical
experimental procedure to Knobe (2003), except that it
required not only intentionality and probability judgments for
outcomes that resulted from the actions of a company
president. The results replicated the findings of Knobe (2003)
and showed a relationship between probability and
intentionality judgment.
Keywords: intentionality, Knobe effect, probability, outcome

Introduction
Imagine a situation in which a chairman of a company
considered starting a new program. This program, according
to the vice-president of the company, would surely profit the
company, but it would also harm the environment. The
chairman asserted that he would start the program in order
to make a profit and that he did not mind harming the
environment. Finally, the program was started, and the
environment was harmed. Did the chairman intentionally
harm the environment? Consider another situation in which
a chairman considered starting a new program that surely
would make a profit and help the environment. In this
situation, the chairman started the program to make a profit
and had no interest in helping the environment, but the
program began and the environment was improved. Now do
you think the chairman intentionally harmed the
environment?
In both situations, the chairman’s main intention to start
a new program was the same; however, the impression of
the chairman’s intentionality may be very different. In fact,
Knobe (2003) demonstrated that the chairman in the
harming situation was considered to be intentionally
harming the environment, whereas he was not intentionally
helping the environment when he made the more helpful
decision. This indicates that ordinary people judge
intentionality depending on what the outcome happens to be.
This phenomenon is called the Knobe effect (e.g., Nichols
& Ulatowski, 2007) or the side-effect effect (Knobe, 2003;
Leslie, Knobe, & Cohen, 2006), and has attracted research
attention from various fields, including action theory (Mele,
2003; McCann, 2005), social psychology (Malle, 2006),

moral psychology (Hauser, 2006), philosophy of law
(Nadelhoffer, 2008), philosophy of language (e.g., Adams &
Steadman, 2004), and developmental psychology (Leslie,
Knobe, & Cohen, 2006).
According to Pierre (2010), intentionality is defined as
“the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to stand for,
things, properties, and states of affairs….” This definition
clearly shows intentionality as some inner state of mind. It
is a drive or cause for action, and its existence is determined
before action. However, the Knobe effect clearly shows that
the lay understanding of intentionality violates this
fundamental definition: people appear to decide
intentionality from the value of the outcome. Thus, this
effect can be considered as an example that lay people have
odd interpretations of intentionality.
Additionally, the Knobe effect contradicts existing
models of intentionality judgment (e.g., Forguson, 1989;
Heider, 1958; Jones & Davis, 1965; Malle & Knobe, 1997;
Shaver, 1985). Originated in the ancient writings of
Aristotle (1892/382 B.C.) and then elaborated on by Hume
(1978/1740), models of intentionality judgment have
assumed inner state of mind as fundamental components for
intentionality such as desire or belief. For example, Malle
and Knobe’s (1997) model that can be positioned as the
most comprehensive one specifies five components for
intentionality: (1) desire that concerns the goals or purposes
of an actor, (2) belief that concerns the actor’s thoughts
about the consequences of his or her actions, (3) intention,
which links desire to action, (4) awareness that represents an
actor’s state of mind at the time of acting, and (5) skill,
which enables the action. These five components
consistently represent will or ability inside the actor, and
none of them seem to entail effect of outcome on
intentionality judgment. Thus, the Knobe effect can be
considered a counterexample to the existing models of
intentionality judgment.
Several hypotheses that have been proposed to explain
the Knobe effect (e.g., Malle, 2006; Mallon, 2008;
Nadelhoffer, 2008; Nichols & Ulatowski, 2007) by focusing
on factors that affect lay people’s understandings of the
meaning of intentionality. Some researchers (e.g., Malle,
2006; Nadelhoffer, 2008) have considered the Knobe effect
to arise as a bias in the intentionality process that is driven
by either moral (Malle, 2006) or emotional (Nadelhoffer,
2008) considerations. Other researchers (e. g., Adams &
Steadman, 2004) have focused on the pragmatic aspect of
intentionality judgment, in which the perception of
intentionality leads to the blaming of the chairman for
hurting the environment, and this effect is strengthened in
the harm condition. Additionally, Nichols and Ulatowski

2681

(2007) noted individual differences in how interpretations as
to whether something is “intentional” contribute to
asymmetry in intentionality judgment between the harming
and helping conditions.
This study also aims to explore the Knobe effect by
pointing out a new factor that would affect intentionality
judgment. More specifically, this study proposes that
probability plays an important role in the Knobe effect.
Although this proposition seems to be unexpected in the
literature of intentionality judgment, it is naturally derived
from the existing studies. The following descriptions
explain this proposition more precisely.
Up to now, many studies on judgment and decision
making have demonstrated a dependency of probability
judgments for future outcomes on their utilities. (for a
review, see Harris, Corner, & Hahn, 2009; Krizan &
Windschitl, 2007). In terms of normative theory, utilities
and probability are separate components for decision
making. However, people’s estimate for how probable the
outcome would occur is affected by its desirability or
subjective value. This idea was suggested by early research
on decision-making (Crandall, Solomon, & Kellaway, 1955;
Edwards, 1953, 1962; Irwin, 1953; Marks, 1951; Morlock &
Hertz, 1964), but controversy has arisen over the necessity
to presume interdependence between utility and probability
(Edwards, 1962; Fisher & Jungermann, 1996; Weber &
Hilton, 1990).
To settle this controversy, Harris et al. (2009) examined
the effect of utility on probability under experimentally
controlled conditions. In Harris et al.’s (2009) study,
participants were shown dot patterns that indicated the
alignment of an apple tree in a farm, and they were required
to estimate the probability of randomly picking up a
poisonous or sour apple from any tree on the farm. The
results of this study showed that the participants estimated
higher probabilities of picking up poisonous apples than of
picking up sour apples, even when they saw the same dot
patterns, indicating that the seriousness of the event surely
affected their probability judgments. In sum, the effect of
utility on probability judgment can be regarded as an
established finding. Further, negative events are estimated at
higher probabilities than are neutral or positive events (for
more discussion, see Fisher & Jungermann, 1996; Krizan &
Windschitl, 2007; Weber & Hilton, 1990).
The finding that utility affects probability indicates a
link between probability and outcome in the Knobe effect
because the manipulations of outcomes may produce a
difference in utility between the two conditions. In addition,
a link between probability and intentionality has already
been suggested by the existing models of intentionality
judgment (e.g., Forguson, 1989; Heider, 1958; Jones &
Davios, 1965; Malle & Knobe, 1997; Shaver, 1985). As
stated above, these models tried to specify certain
components of intentionality judgment, and among them,
desire and belief have been positioned as the basic
components of intentionality by these models (for a review,
see Malle & Knobe, 1997). Between these two components,

belief appears to relate to probability because it concerns
thinking about the outcome of an action. For example,
following Malle and Knobe (1997), belief is defined as
“beliefs or thoughts about the consequences of the act or the
act itself before it takes place. (pp.106)” This definition
clearly relates belief to a prediction of an outcome,
reflecting some measure of uncertainty about a future event.
Thus, it is natural to interpret the existing models as
suggesting an important role of probability on intentionality.
In sum, reviewing the existing literature on decisionmaking and intentionality judgments suggests a link
between probability and intentionality judgments, as well as
one between outcome and probability. As a result, there is a
possibility that the Knobe effect, in fact, is the result of an
effect of probability on intentionality judgment. The
purpose of this paper is to test this possibility. To
accomplish this, the following three studies were performed.
Study 1 adopted almost the same procedure as Knobe
(2003) except that it also required participants to give their
own subjective probabilities for harming and helping
environments. Study 2a replicated the results in Study 1 and
quantitatively examined the effect of probability on
intentionality judgment via multivariate analysis. Study 2b
tried to replicate the results of Study 2a by employing
another scenario used in Knobe’s (2003) study. The results
of these three studies consistently supported the hypothesis,
but they also showed that effect of outcome remains when
controlling for the effect of probability on intentionality
judgments.

Study 1
Design and procedure
Ninety-five undergraduates participated in Study 1 as a
way to receive classroom credit. Fifty participants in the
harming condition read the following scenario, which was
adopted from Knobe (2003) and was translated into
Japanese. The scenario read as follows:
The vice-president of a company went to the chairman
of the board and said, “We are thinking of starting a
new program. It will help us increase profits, but it
will also harm the environment.”
The chairman of the board answered, “I don’t care at
all about harming the environment. I just want to make
as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.”
They started the new program. Sure enough, the
environment was harmed.
Forty-five participants in the helping condition read
almost the same scenario, except the word “harm” was
changed to “help” in this version of the text. After reading
one of these scenarios, participants answered questions
concerning the chairman’s intentionality in either harming
or helping the environment (“Do you think the chairman
intentionally harmed/helped the environment?”) by two
forced choice task (“intentional/not intentional”).

Additionally, the participants also answered questions
concerning the probability for harming/helping the
environment that they thought the chairman considered
before he made his decision (i.e., “With what probability did
the chairman think the program would harm/help the
environment?”) by percentage (%). The order of
intentionality and probability judgment tasks was
counterbalanced.

Results and discussion
The results shown in Figure 1 clearly demonstrate that the
intentionality of the chairman was perceived as being
different between the harming and helping conditions.
Whereas 60% (27/45) of the participants in the harming
condition considered that the chairman intentionally harmed
the environment, only 8% (4/50) of the participants in the
helping condition considered that the chairman intentionally
helped the environment. The difference between the two
conditions was statistically significant (ratio test; p < .05),
indicating that our findings in Study 1 replicated the Knobe
effect.

The results shown in Figure 2 also demonstrate a difference
in the probability judgment task between the two conditions.
A mean probability estimate in the harming condition was
higher than that observed in the helping condition. This
difference is statistically significant (t(93) = 3.37, p < .05),
indicating that the participants considered that the chairman
more likely to harm, rather than help the environment.
Figure 3 shows probability estimates as a function of
participants’ intentionality judgments, and this appears to
indicate that the probability estimates by the participants
who chose “intentional” were higher than were those made
by the participants who chose “not intentional” as a
response. This difference was statistically significant in the
harming condition (t(43) = 2.07, p < .05). Although the
difference was not statistically significant in the helping
condition (t(48) = 1.20, p > .10), I thought that this was due
to the small number of participants who chose “not
intentional” in the helping condition (n = 4). As far as
seeing values of the mean estimates, the results in Figure 3
suggest that intentionality judgment was positively
correlated with probability judgment.
The results of Study 1 supported the hypothesis that
probability is a crucial factor in the appearance of the Knobe
effect. Manipulations toward a certain outcome affected not
only intentional judgment but also probability judgment,
and these two judgments correlated with each other. These
results suggested that the Knobe effect depends on not only
the value of outcome but also on the probabilistic aspect of
the scenario.

Study 2a
Although the results of Study 1supported the possibility that
probability affect intentionality judgment, a quantitative
aspect of this relationship still remains uncovered. Thus,
Study 2a aimed to explore this point by requiring
participants to make intentionality judgment by Likert scale
instead of two-forced choice task.

Design and procedure
Study 2a adopted almost the same procedure as that of
Study 1. Twenty-seven participants read the same harming
scenario, and twenty-five participants read the same helping
scenario that was used in Study 1. Then, after reading one of
these two scenarios, the participants completed both the
intentionality and probability judgment tasks as described
above. However, one difference was that the intentionality
judgment in Study 2 was measured on an 8-point scale (0:
not intentional; 9: intentional) instead of a two forcedchoice task. The order of the two tasks was randomized
among all the participants.

Results and discussion
The results shown in Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that
Study 2 replicated the main results of Study 1. The
chairman’s intentionality was estimated to be higher in the
harming condition than in the helping condition (t(50) =
4.14, p < .01), and the mean probability estimate for the
participants in the harming condition was significantly
higher than the helping condition (t(50) = 2.26, p < .01).

probability judgments, multiple regression analysis was

performed. In this analysis, the independent variables were
outcome and probability, and the dependent variable was
intentionality judgment. The results (Figure 6) showed that
both of the independent variables significantly affected
intentionality judgment, and the magnitude of the effect
from probability was larger than that from value of the
result. Additionally, mediation analyses indicate that the
indirect effect from outcome via probability on
intentionality judgment was marginally significant.

2684

The results of Study 2 indicated the following three
things. First, the effect of outcome on probability was robust.
Second, the Knobe effect appeared to be a compound
phenomenon affected crucially by both probability and
outcome. Third, probability appears to be more crucial to
the Knobe effect than outcome.

Study 2b
The results of Studies 1 and 2a are limited in that they used
only one aspect of Knobe’s research scenario (2003); thus,
Study 2b aimed to replicate the findings of both Studies 1
and 2b by using the sergeant scenario that was used in
Knobe’s (2003) second experiment.

intentionality attributed to the lieutenant was estimated to be
higher in the harming condition than in the helping
condition (t(122) = 4.59, p < .01), and the mean probability
estimate that the lieutenant thought about killing his soldiers
first in order to gain his ultimate win was significantly
higher than the mean estimate observed in the
helping/saving condition (t(122) = 4.07, p < .01).
Additionally, the results of a path analysis showed almost
the same trends as in Study 2a, which suggested that not
only the outcome but also the probability affected
intentionality judgment, and the effect of probability is
larger than the effect of outcome. These results indicated
that the findings in Study 2a are not limited to the chairman
scenario.

Design and procedure
Study 2b adopted almost the same procedure as that of
Study 2a, except that 124 participants read the sergeant
scenario (Knobe, 2003, second experiment), which went as
follows:
A lieutenant was talking with a sergeant. The lieutenant
gave the order, “Send your squad to the top of
Thompson Hill.”
The sergeant said, “But if I send my squad to the top
of Thompson Hill, we’ll be moving the men directly
into the enemy’s line of fire. Some of them will surely
be killed!”
The lieutenant answered, “Look, I know that they’ll be
in the line of fire, and I know that some of them will be
killed. But I don’t care at all about what happens to our
soldiers. All I care about is taking control of Thompson
Hill.”
The squad was sent to the top of Thompson Hill. As
expected, the soldiers were moved into the enemy’s
line of fire, and some of them were killed.
The above scenario was used for the “kill” scenario
condition in which 62 individuals participated. The
remaining 62 participants read the “save” scenario, where
word “kill” was exchanged with “save.” After reading one
of the two scenarios, the participants answered questions
concerning intentionality (“Do you think the lieutenant
intentionally killed/saved the squad?”), and they completed
the probability judgment task (“With what probability did
the lieutenant think the squad would be killed/saved?”).
These were the same types of questions, asked in the same
way, as in Study 1a. The order of probability and
intentionality judgment tasks was randomized among the
participants. All the participants completed the tasks within
10 minutes.

Results and discussion
The results shown in Figures 4 and 5 demonstrated that
Study 2b replicated the findings of Study 2a. The

General discussion
The results of the above three studies consistently
supported the hypothesis that probability plays an important
role in the Knobe effect. Study 1 showed significant
differences in probability judgments between the harming
and helping conditions and between participants who chose
an “intentional” responses compared to those who did not.
Study 2a found that both the effects of outcome and
probability on intentionality judgments were significant, and
the effect of probability was larger than that of outcome.
Study 2b replicated the results of Study 2a by using another
scenario in Knobe’s (2003) study. All of these results
indicate the crucial influence of probability on the Knobe
effect, and are, as a whole, in line with the findings that
negative events are estimated to occur with higher
probabilities than are neutral or positive events (Harris et al,
2009; Weber & Hilton, 1990).
Previous studies (e.g., Knobe, 2003; Malle, 2006;
Mallon, 2008; Nadelhoffer, 2008; Nichols & Ulatowski,
2007) have positioned the Knobe effect as an issue of
interpretation in regards to intentionality. In contrast to these
studies, however, this paper gives a unique explanation of
the Knobe effect. People may consider an action to be
intentional because it would make a negative outcome a
certainty. The role of probability in the Knobe effect has not
been focused on in previous studies, so this explanation
uncovers a new aspect of making judgments under uncertain
conditions in a Knobe effect situation. Of course, this paper
is limited in that it adopts a correlational approach; thus, a
causal relation between intentionality and probability
remains an unresolved question. Although this paper itself
cannot address this question, the author believes that an
investigation into the possible close relationship between
probability and intentionality is worth further study.
This paper can be also positioned as an example of the
influence of belief on intentionality judgment; thus, it
supports the existing models for intentionality judgments
(e.g., Forguson, 1989; Heider, 1958; Jones & Davios, 1965;
Malle & Knobe, 1997; Shaver, 1985). Of all these previous
studies, this current paper corresponds most to Malle and
Knobe (1997) because it demonstrates that the Knobe effect
can be explained by their model. According to their model,

2685

intentionality judgments are affected by the five factors:
desire, belief, intention, awareness, and skill. Knobe (2003)
himself considered his effect to be a counterexample of
Malle and Knobe’s (1997) model because none of these five
factors can explain the effect of outcome on intentionality
judgments. In contrast to Knobe’s interpretation, however,
this paper suggests the possibility that the Knobe effect is
compatible with Malle and Knobe’s model in that it clarifies
manipulations toward outcomes according to a specific
probability, and this directly corresponds to the effect of the
probability itself, as well as to the effect of the belief. This
indicates that the Knobe effect is, in fact, supportive of
Malle and Knobe’s (1997) findings, and it shows that the
existing models certainly may explain the Knobe effect by
extending a meaning of belief.
This paper is also implicative in revealing that the
Knobe effect is a compound phenomenon due to certain
outcomes and their probabilities. Knobe (2003) treated his
effect as an outcome of intentionality, and subsequent
studies (e.g., Mallon, 2008; Nichols & Ulatowski, 2007)
assume that outcome is the only factor that can produce the
Knobe effect. To this end, they have focused on how to
interpret the effect of the outcome. This paper, however,
succeeds in pointing out probability as another key factor in
the Knobe effect. In addition, when taking into
consideration the values of the path coefficients, the
findings of this study indicate that probability is a much
more important factor than outcome. Of course, this paper
does not insist that probability alone can explain the Knobe
effect because the effect of outcome was still significant
when controlling for the effect of probability. Rather, in line
with the existing model for intentionality judgment (e.g.,
Forguson, 1989; Heider, 1958; Jones & Davios, 1965; Malle
& Knobe, 1997; Shaver, 1985), this paper suggests that
intentionality judgment should be considered a compound
phenomenon, affected by various factors, including desire or
belief. Future research should investigate the Knobe effect
as result of these and other complex psychological processes.
