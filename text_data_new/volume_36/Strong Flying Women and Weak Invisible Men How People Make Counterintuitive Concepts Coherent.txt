Abstract
This paper reports on a study designed to investigate how
people understand superhuman concepts that are of interest to
cognitive scientists of religion. Similar to findings of
previous studies of surprising social conceptual combinations,
we found that people generated numerous emergent
properties for such concepts. These results support the
knowledge-based models of conceptual combination.

Supernatural Agents & Religion
Religion: the belief in and worship of a
superhuman controlling power, especially a
personal God or gods.
(Oxford-Dictionaries, 2010)

Keywords: Semantic memory, folk psychology, conceptual
development.

Introduction
Since the early days of cognitive science, study of concepts
has formed the core of the discipline because concepts are
thought to be “the building blocks of thought” (Franks,
2003) and “the basis of word meaning” (Murphy, 1988).
Understanding creation of complex concepts by combining
simpler concepts is crucial to the success of this enterprise
(Kunda, Miller, & Claire, 1990; Murphy, 1988; Osherson &
Smith, 1981).
Understanding how concepts with
contradictory properties are combined has also been of
recent interest to cognitive scientists of religion
investigating the spread of counterintuitive religious
concepts (Boyer, 1994, 2001; Franks, 2003). Boyer (1994;
2001) argued that most widespread religious concepts
around the world are minimally counterintuitive (or MCI for
short) and that this is because minimally counterintuitive
concepts are more memorable than intuitive and maximally
counterintuitive concepts.
MCI concepts such as “a
listening tree” are minimally counterintuitive because they
violate a small number of intuitive expectations associated
with the basic category (e.g., tree in this case) that along
with a counterintuitive property (e.g., listening in this
example) constitutes such concepts. Franks (2001) argued
that MCI concepts are best considered as combinations of
concepts with contradictory properties. He further argued
that at least “some religious representations may involve
relation mapping combinations”
(Page 50). Unlike
property mapping combinations where a property of the
constituent concepts is simply transferred to the combined
concept, in relational mapping a meaning relation that is not
represented in either of the constituent concepts indicates
how they are related to make the combined concept (Page
46). The relationship establishment processes, especially in
the context of conflicting properties (Heit, 1998), are
thought to use relevant background knowledge to create a
coherent conceptual combination. However, as an extensive
review of the literature by (Ran & Duimering, 2009)
recently noted, the precise nature of how relevant

Boyer was not the first scholar of religion to observe the
crucial role played by supernatural concepts in general, and
superhuman concepts in particular, in religious cognition of
people around the world. Scholars of religion from a variety
of traditions have argued that belief in superhuman entities
is a hallmark of religion (Giddens, 1989; Horton, 1960;
Lawson & McCauley, 1990; Spiro, 1966; Tylor, 1871;
Wallace, 1966). One of the oldest definitions of religion
comes from Tyler (1871) who defined it as “the belief in
spiritual beings.” Preferring the term “supernatural beings”
over “spiritual beings”, Wallace (1966) defined religion as
“behavior that can be classified as belief and ritual
concerned with supernatural beings, powers and forces”
(Page 5). Lawson and McCauley (1990) define a religious
system as a “symbolic-cultural system of ritual acts
accompanied by an extensive and largely shared conceptual
scheme that includes culturally postulated superhuman
agents” (Page 5).
Lawson and McCauley have joined a growing group of
scholars of religion advocating a new cognitive science of
religion to understand how human minds represent and
acquire superhuman agent conceptual schemas (Guthrie,
1993; Whitehouse, 2004). These cognitive scientists of
religion argue that an understanding of psychology of
language comprehension and learning is needed to
understand why some ideas spread widely to become
cultural successes while others quickly perish.
Memorability advantages have been a particular focus of
this work. A number of studies have found that minimally
counterintuitive (MCI) concepts are remembered better than
intuitive and maximally counterintuitive concepts (Atran,
2004; J. Barrett & Nyhof, 2001; Boyer & Ramble, 2001;
Upal, 2005). Attempts to account for these findings have
differed on whether contextual factors play a crucial role in
making MCI ideas memorable, and whether memory for
MCI concepts is a distinct phenomenon or whether it is
related to memory for schema-violating/distinctive concepts
(J. L. Barrett, 2008; Russell, 2013; Upal, 2009). While the
context-based view (Upal, 2005, 2009; Upal, Gonce,

3002

Tweney, & Slone, 2007) has argued that a concept can only
be counterintuitive in a specific context for a specific
individual at a specific time, the content-based view (J.
Barrett & Nyhof, 2001; J. L. Barrett, 2008) has downplayed
the role of context by arguing that certain concepts can be
universally counterintuitive for all people all the time.
Contrary to the proponents of the content-based view that a
“fundamentally different theory” (Page 92: Barrett 2008) is
needed to explain the MCI effect, Upal (2005; 2009)
developed his explanation of the MCI effect based on the
traditional cognitive science work on schema/script-based
semantic memory (Graesser, Gordon, & Sawyer, 1979;
Kintsch, 1998; Schank, 1999; Schank & Abelson, 1977) and
conceptual combinations (Ran & Duimering, 2009). While
early models of conceptual combination (Osherson &
Smith, 1981) were content-based and ignored the role of
background knowledge, more recent work (Hampton,
1997a; Kunda et al., 1990; Murphy, 1988; Wisniewski,
1999) has emphasized the role played by this knowledge in
making combined concepts coherent.
In a set of studies (Hampton, 1997b; Hastie, C., & Weber,
1990; Kunda et al., 1990), when researchers asked people to
generate properties of surprising (such as a “blind marathon
runner”) and intuitive social concepts (such as a “female
nurse”), they found that people generated more emergent
properties for surprising than intuitive concepts. Emergent
properties are those properties that participants believe are
characteristic of the combined concept but do not
characterize any of the constituent concepts. Emergent
properties are thought to result from reasoning processes
(variously labeled creative (Hastie et al., 1990), elaborative
(Murphy, 1988), problem solving (Hampton, 1997b), and
explanatory) that use contextual information to resolve the
perceived inconsistency between the constituent concepts.
This explains why it takes longer to process surprising
conceptual combinations than the intuitive ones (Hampton,
1997b). While results from previous studies are suggestive,
none was designed to study people’s expectations of
counterintuitive concepts as defined by cognitive scientists
of religion (J. L. Barrett, 2008). The study we describe next
was specifically designed to address this gap.

Material & Procedure
The materials consisted of an online form that listed the
six concepts each followed by a text field. Using the
instructions developed by McRae et al. (2005), we asked
participants to type in as many properties of each of the four
concepts as they could think of in the text-box.

Results & Discussion
The participant responses were coded by following a twostep process. The first step involved creating semantically
similar clusters for features produced by participants. Thus
the following participant responses to features for the
category person
-“can feel”,
- “is emotional”,
-“has emotions”, and
- “has feelings”
were all put into one feature labeled “has emotions.”
Once the most representative feature labels had been
created, the second step was carried out. This involved
assigning a 1 if the participant was judged to have indicated
the feature and assigning a 0 otherwise. Each category
feature was assigned a weight by computing the average
coded value. Thus, a category feature that was indicated by
all 150 participants would be assigned a value of 1, and a
feature not mentioned by any participant would be given a
zero weight. The category features were ranked by weight
from the most prevalent to the least prevalent. Results are
shown in Figures 1 to 6 below.

There are significant differences between the new
properties people generated for the five superhuman
conceptual combinations. While “is strong” and “is a
superhero” were the most commonly mentioned features for
both “man who can walk through walls” and “person who
can see through walls,” and “woman who can leap over
skyscrapers,” this was not the case with other three
superhuman concepts. While “is a superhero” was the top
feature for “man who can fly,” similar to the two
aforementioned concepts, it was not among the top two
features listed for either of the two concepts of “woman who
can hear whispers from miles away” or “person who is
invisible.” The most surprising finding for us was the
inclusion of negative cluster of features by our participants
among the features of the concept “person who is invisible.”
This shows that while the other four superhuman concepts
were mostly thought about in positive terms, people had
mixed positive and negative feelings about invisible people.
What do our results tell us about people’s propensity to
generate emergent feature as seen in previous studies of
conflicting conceptual combinations? Can we call the new
properties generated by our participants to be emergent?
Not quite, because we only elicited features of one of the
constituent concepts and not the other. The next study was
designed to fill this gap.

Eliciting features of objects with these properties is,
however, not as straightforward as it may first seem.
Clearly, the action properties such as walking, seeing, and
hearing cannot be investigated without assigning an actor to
the actions. If this actor is perceived by our participants to
be conflicting with the property, we are back to the set-up of

3004

Experiment 1. We decided to use superhero as an actor
because superheroes can be expected to have
counterintuitive properties and thus the conceptual
combination would not be seen as conflicting by our
participants. We elicited features for the following five
concepts in this study.

1. Superhero who can walk through walls
2. Superhero who can see through walls
3. Superhero who can hear whispers from miles
away
4. Superhero who can fly, and
5. Superhero who is invisible.

The results show that the largest number (10) of emergent
features was generated for the concept of “a man who can
walk through walls” and the fewest number (2) was
generated for the concept of “a person who can see through
walls.” In general, people generated fewer emergent
features for the concepts of “person who can see through
walls” and “woman who can hear whispers from miles
away” as compared with the other three superhuman
concepts. Also a smaller proportion of participants mutually
agreed on the fewer emergent features for these two
concepts.

To determine properties that emerged through
combination of the person concept with a counterintuitive
property p, we searched for properties people produced for
the combined concept but that were not included either in
the person concept (shown in Figure 1) or the corresponding
combined superhero concept with the property p. Table 1
shows the properties that were generated by at least two
participants.

“Is a ghost” was the emergent feature listed most
frequently for both the concepts of “a person who is
invisible” as well as “a man who can walk through walls.”
Since being invisible and being able to walk through walls
are strongly associated with the concept of a ghost, it makes
sense that our participants were strongly reminded of the
ghost concept upon hearing of these properties.
Furthermore, the person’s being a ghost allows our
participants to explain as to why the person can walk
through walls and why the person is invisible. Generating
such justifications for the counterintuitive property is a
crucial part of the context-based model as well as
knowledge-based conceptual combination approaches that
the model is based on.

Looking through the list of emergent properties, it seems
clear that most emergent properties are a byproduct of this
justification process. Thus being lonely, shy, and being an
outcast readily come to mind if one interprets being
invisible metaphorically while “is dead” and “is a ghost”
come to mind if one interprets the expression literally (Upal,
2007). Similarly, “knows to use a plane,” “is a pilot,” “is in
a helicopter,” “has a jetpack” come to mind if one interprets
“person who can fly” as an intuitive concept.
A
counterintuitive interpretation of the person as being birdlike, makes one think of the features of “has wings” and “is
thin/skinny/light.” “Is a ghost,” “is dead” and “is an alien”
are results of interpreting “person who can walk through
walls” as a counterintuitive concepts while “knows to use a
door/window” result from a creative intuitive interpretation
of the expression. Being a scientist who has invented a
crazy machine to see through walls allows one to justify the
concept of “a person who can see through walls.” Finally,
“being nosey” and “having big ears” allows one to make
some sense of the concept of “a woman who can hear
whispers from miles away.”
The second type of emergent features are the features that
are most commonly associated with the coherent
combination achieved through the justification process i.e.,
these are the consequences of the combined concept. Thus
“travels for free” and “is handsome” is a consequence of the
“man who can fly” being interpreted as a pilot. Being big,
muscular, arrogant, invincible, “has many friends” and “can
go anywhere” can be seen as consequences of being a man
who can force one’s way through walls. Being able to read
minds can be seen as a consequence of the ability to see
through skulls and detect mental states. “Has trouble
sleeping,” “can go insane,” and “talks loudly” are
consequences of the ability to hear everything being talked
about for miles and feeling the need to talk over others.
The fact that people generated fewer emergent features
for “person who can see through walls” and “woman who
can hear whispers for miles” may be because people had
trouble justifying these two concepts because they were
seen as more counterintuitive than the other three
superhuman concepts. This is also suggested by the fact
that only a small proportion of participants agreed on the
emergent properties. A direct test of this hypothesis,
however, must wait further work as the current study did not
ask participants to rate concepts for plausibility.

Conclusion
Superhuman concepts are thought by scholars of religion
to be hallmarks of religious cognition. This paper reports
on a study carried out to investigate how people understand
such complex concepts. Similar to findings of previous
studies of surprising social conceptual combinations, we
found that people generated numerous emergent properties
for such concepts. These results support the knowledgebased models of conceptual combination.
