Abstract
Many languages have a word class whose speech sounds are
linked to sensory experiences (sound symbolism). Here we
investigated sound symbolism in taste. Specifically, we
performed psychological experiments to study the relationship
between phonemes of Japanese sound symbolic words and
emotional evaluations of objects in taste. In the experiment,
when participants drank something, they were asked to express
the taste sensation using Japanese sound symbolic words and
then rate the comfort of the object with the semantic differential
(SD) method. This experiment was aimed at specifying the
systematic association between phonemes of Japanese
onomatopoeic words and taste-emotion evaluations. Our results
showed the existence of unique associations between the
phonemes of the words for expressing the sensation and the
evaluations of comfort/discomfort in taste and showed the
possibility to clarify taste categories using sound symbolic
method. As previous studies have suggested, onomatopoeic
words expressing food texture are more easily used for
emotional evaluations in taste than those expressing taste itself.
However, we found a strong association between phonemes and
SD scales related to taste such as “sweet”, “bitter”, and “salty”.
Therefore, we showed that sound symbolic words could be
important indexes in investigating various level of perceptual
dimension of taste including emotional evaluations like
comfort/discomfort.
Keywords: Sound symbolism; Taste; Texture; Emotional
evaluation; Onomatopoeia

Introduction
Humans can perceive and differentiate tastes in foods and
drinks. Although humans can richly perceive variations of
taste, the relationships among taste categories are not clearly
generalized. Humans categorize sensory inputs using words,
and words are an important index in investigating such
sensory categories. Although the relationship between the
sound of a word and its meaning has long been considered
to be arbitrary (e.g., Saussure, 1916), the existence of

synesthetic associations between sounds and sensory
experiences (sound symbolism) has been demonstrated over
the decades (e.g., Jespersen, 1922; Köhler, 1929; Newman,
1933; Sapir, 1929; Taylor, 1963; Werner & Wapner, 1952;
Wertheimer, 1958, for early studies) and, to varying extent
in a wide variety of languages (e.g., Brown, Black, &
Horowitz, 1955; Davis, 1961; Emeneau, 1969; Hinton,
Nichols, & Ohala, 1994; Klank, Huang, & Johnson, 1971;
Nuckrolls, 1999; Voeltz & Kilian-Hatz, 2001). The
characteristics and universality of such sensory-sound
correspondence have been studied to provide a clue for
understanding the development of language abilities (Imai,
Kita, Nagumo, & Okada, 2008; Kantartzis, Imai, & Kita,
2011; Maurer, Pathman, & Mondloch, 2006; Westbury,
2004) and language evolution (Ohala, 1997; Ramachandran
& Hubbard, 2001).
It is also known that the sensory-sound correspondence
can be found not only in words referring to visual shapes,
which was demonstrated in the landmark studies, which
identified “mal/mil” and “bouba/kiki” for round and sharp
shapes, respectively, but also in those referring to tactile,
smell, and taste sensations.
Japanese is known to have a large number of
onomatopoeic words to express sensory experiences. Taste
sensation is one of those frequently expressed by
onomatopoeia in Japanese. Thus, in this paper we
investigate the sound symbolic associations between
phonemes of Japanese onomatopoeia for expressing taste
sensations and subjective evaluations of comfort/discomfort
for objects in taste.
Watanabe et al. (2012) investigated sound symbolic
associations between phonemes of Japanese onomatopoeia
for expressing tactile sensations and subjective evaluations
of comfort/discomfort for touched objects. Fifteen naïve
participants, aged between 19 and 26, ten males and five
females, reported an onomatopoeic word to express the

2871

tactile feeling while touching one of 120 tactile substances,
and evaluated the comfort/discomfort of the touched
material on a seven-point scale (Very comfortable +3,
Comfortable +2, Slightly comfortable +1, Neither 0, and
three levels, -1 to -3, for uncomfortable feeling) while
touching it. The results produced 1800 sets of onomatopoeic
words and subjective evaluations of comfort level (120
substances x 15 participants). In 87.1% of all trials (1569
cases), the onomatopoeic word had a two-mora repetition
form (e.g. "sara-sara"). Therefore, they analyzed the
relationship between the phonemes of onomatopoeic words
in two-mora repetitions form and evaluations of
comfort/discomfort using the 1569 instances. The average
of the ratings obtained across the 1569 cases was 0.08. This
value suggests that half of trials yielded a rating in a
comfortable level, and the other half a rating in an
uncomfortable level (nonbiased for participant’s response
opportunities). The averages of ratings across trials in which
the same phonemes were used in the first syllable were
statistically compared with the average of the 1569 cases
(0.08) (t-test comparing the average with constant value).
As for the vowels, they reported that only /u/ had a
statistically significant relationship to comfort. Vowels /i/
and /e/ were not used often, but they were deeply related to
discomfort (/i/ was marginally significant, and /e/ was
significant). Among the consonants, /m/, /h/, and /s/ were
related to comfort, while /g/, /z/, /j/, /b/, and /n/ were
significantly related to discomfort.
Inspired by this previous study, we here investigate sound
symbolism in taste. Specifically, we perform psychological
experiments to explore the relationship between phonemes
of Japanese sound symbolic words and emotional
evaluations of objects in taste. The purpose of the
experiments is to specify the association between phonemes
of Japanese onomatopoeic words and taste-emotion
evaluations. We compare the results obtained from our
experiments with those of our previous experiment where
participants expressed the sensation obtained from touched
substances using Japanese sound symbolic words and
evaluated the comfort of tactile sensation. In the analysis of
sound symbolism in taste, we carefully consider two things
in performing a psychophysical experiment. When we taste
something, not only taste itself but also texture plays an
important role. We say, for example, “this is “huwa-huwa”
and tasty” or “this tastes bad and “neba-neba”. “Huwahuwa” is an expression for comfortable touch, while “nebaneba” is an expression for uncomfortable touch. Food
texture is a kind of tactile sensation of food or drink in your
mouth going down your throat.
In the analysis, we therefore elucidate the relationship
between the phonemes of onomatopoeic words and
evaluations of comfort/discomfort using substances which
are the same in taste but different in texture. The previous
study of the sound symbolism in tactile sensation showed
that the sound of onomatopoeia is related to
comfort/discomfort significantly. We compare the previous
results with those obtained in the present experiment using

substances with different food texture. We compare the
results obtained from the substances different only in texture
with those obtained from those different only in taste.

Method
For the purposes described in the above, we performed a
psychophysical experiment. After participants had tasted
various drinks different in taste or in texture, participants
were asked to respond with onomatopoeia associated with
the sensation and rate how much they liked the taste or
texture of the object, hereafter ‘comfort/discomfort, using
the SD method.

Participants
Twenty naïve participants (seventeen males and three
females), aged between 20 and 40 years old, took part in the
experiments. The participant was not informed of the
purpose of the experiment, and they had no known
abnormalities in speech or in their ability to discern texture.
They visited a laboratory at the University of ElectroCommunications to conduct trials.

Substances
We chose drinks as substances in our experiment because
the taste and texture of drinks can be more easily controlled
than those of foods. We searched for drinks with various
tastes and textures and decided to use cola, sports drink,
coffee, milk, green tea, and vegetable juice from a basic
drink product category. We altered the taste of the six basic
drinks by adding soy sauce in order to analyze the
relationship between the phonemes of onomatopoeic words
and evaluations of comfort/discomfort among substances
which are the same in texture but different in taste. On the
other hand, we altered their texture by adding water or
carbonated water in order to analyze the relationship
between the phonemes of onomatopoeic words and
evaluations of comfort/discomfort among materials that are
the same in taste but different in texture. The materials
prepared for the experiment are listed in Table 1. For the
taste and texture alternations, 10 ml of soy sauce was mixed
with 100 ml of the basic drinks, and 100 ml of water or
carbonated water was mixed with 100 ml of the basic drinks.

Semantic differential scales
Hayakawa et al. (2005) collected 445 Japanese words which
are used to express food texture. We excluded
onomatopoeia from 445 words because our objective was to
analyze onomatopoeia obtained from the experiment. As a
result, 132 words were selected as candidates for use as SD
scales ("sparkling - still", "thick – thin", and "smooth –
rough", and “good texture – bad texture”). Then, referring to
the “Word list by semantic principles” collected by the
National Institute for Japanese Language (Bunruigoihyo,
1964), we selected four pairs of adjective as SD scales
related to texture, namely "sparkling - still", "thick – thin",
and "smooth – rough", and “good texture –bad texture”.

2872

Referring again to the “Word list by semantic principles”,
we selected five pairs of adjectives as SD scales related to
taste, namely "sweet – not sweet", "bitter – not bitter", "salty
– not salty", "sour – not sour", and "hot – not hot".
Furthermore, we added "comfortable – uncomfortable” as a
highly emotional scale. For all ten SD scales, the ratings
were made on a 7-point scale ranging from -3 through 0 to
+3.

Procedure
Participants, blindfolded, sat on a chair and drank 24
substances one by one in sips (15 ml.). After they had drunk
one of the substances, participants were asked to drink water
to clean their mouths and throats. Half of the participants
first reported as many onomatopoeic words as they liked to
express how they felt while drinking each of the 24
substances. Then, they rated ten SD scales. The other half of
the participants first rated ten SD scales. Then, they reported
as many onomatopoeic words as they liked to express how
they felt while drinking one of the 24 substances. This is
because onomatopoeia association may affect the evaluation
by SD scales or evaluation by SD scales may affect
onomatopoeia association. In the experiments, the
experimenter prepared each substance right before the
participants drank it. The substances were presented in a
random order

Results
Phonemes associated with comfort/discomfort
The results produced 740 sets of onomatopoeic words and
subjective evaluations of comfort level (24 substances x 20
participants). In 94.3% of all the trials (480 cases), the
onomatopoeic words had a two-mora repetition form (e.g.
"sara-sara"). We therefore analyzed the relationship between
phonemes of onomatopoeic words in two-mora repetitions
form and evaluations of comfort/discomfort using the 480
instances. The average of the ratings obtained across the 480
cases was -0.42. This value suggests that a number of trials
yielded a rating in an uncomfortable level (nonbiased for
participant’s response opportunities).
We took particular note of the vowels and consonants of
the first syllable, which show strong sound symbolic
associations (Hamano, 1998). The averages of ratings across
trials in which the same phonemes were used in the first
syllable were statistically compared with the average of the
420 cases (-0.42) (t-test comparing the average with
constant value). Of the vowels, as shown in Table 2, only /a/
had a statistically significant relationship to comfort.
Vowels /i/ was deeply related to discomfort (/i/ was
marginally significant). Among the consonants, /sy/, /h/, and
/s/ were related to comfort, while /g/, /z/, /b/, /d/, /n/and Ø
were significantly related to discomfort.
We compared the results of our study with those of our
previous study (Watanabe et al. 2012) for the tactile
sensation as shown in the column of “Touch” in Table 2.
The results of taste and touch are the same in the
relationship of /s/ and /h/ with comfort evaluation and /i/, /z/,
/b/ and /g/ with discomfort evaluation. On the other hand,
only for the results of this study, /a/ and /sh/ are
significantly related to comfort and /d/ and /Ø/are
significantly related to discomfort. Although the results of
this study are partly different in the kind of phonemes
related to comfort/discomfort from those for touch, the
number of phonemes related to comfort/discomfort is the
same. Therefore, the evaluation of comfort/discomfort of
drinks is associated with phonemes of onomatopoeic words
expressing how they felt while drinking in the same way as
the results of our previous study of touch.
Then, we compared the results obtained from the
substances different only in texture with those obtained
from the substances different only in taste, as shown in
Table 3. /a/ and /s/ had a statistically significant relationship
to comfort for the substances different only in taste as well
as those different only in texture, while /sh/ is significantly
related to comfort only for the substances different in taste
and /h/ is significantly associated with comfort only for the
substances different only in texture. On the other hand, /b/,
/g/, /i/, and /z/ had a statistically significant relationship to
discomfort for the substances different only in taste as well
as those different only in texture, while /d/, /e, and /Ø/ are
significantly related to discomfort for the substances
different only in taste.

phonemes of onomatopoeic words. Ten or eleven phonemes
are significantly related to these scales. Since these scales
are texture scales, evaluations of texture might be easily
associated with phonemes of onomatopoeic words. The
positive or negative evaluations of “sparkling” and
“smooth” have a statistically significant relationship to /s/,

2874

Discussion

/sy/, /n/, /p/, /d/, /Ø/, /m/ and /o/. The evaluations of “thick”
and “salty” are the second most frequently categorized into
phonemes of onomatopoeic words. Eight phonemes are
significantly related to these scales. The positive or negative
evaluations of “thick” and “salty” have a statistically
significant relationship to /s/, /sh/, /d/, and /a/. As for the
phonemes related to “thick-thin”, /n/, /d/, /m/, and /o/ are
significantly related to “thick” (e.g., “neba-neba” meaning
sticky, "doro-doro" meaning muddy), while /s/, /sy/, /a/, and
/i/ are significantly related to “thin” (e.g., "sara-sara"
meaning smooth). The evaluations of “sweet”, “bitter”,
“sour”, and “hot” are not easily symbolized by phonemes of
onomatopoeic words. Only five or six phonemes are
significantly related to these scales. Since these scales are
specific for taste, evaluations of taste might be not so easily
associated with phonemes of onomatopoeic words as
evaluations of texture. However, we found a strong
association between phonemes and some SD scales related
to taste. For example, vowels and consonants /n/, /i/, and /o/
were significantly related to “bitter-not bitter”. The vowel
/i/ was significantly related to “sweet-not sweet”.
Furthermore, the consonants /s/, /g/ were significantly
related to “salty-not salty”. This means that evaluations of
taste can be symbolized by phonemes of Japanese
onomatopoeic words, although previous studies (e.g.
Yamanashi, 1988) have suggested that, unlike touch, taste
is not expressed by onomatopoeic words.

Humans categorize sensory inputs using words, and
words are important indexes in investigating such sensory
categories. Previous studies of tactile sensations identified
major factors in tactile perception and established standards
of classification based on physical properties of substances
or in terms of sets of adjectives (e.g., Tiest, & Kappers,
2006). However, the previous methods using adjectives
have limitations. If adjective labels that represent a certain
perceptual dimension are not involved, the perceptual
dimension would never be extracted. Therefore, it is
debatable whether the pairs of adjectives are capable of
richly expressing variations of tactile sensations including
emotional evaluations like comfort/discomfort. Watanabe et
al. (2012) proposed a new method using sound symbolic
associations between phonemes of Japanese onomatopoeia
for expressing tactile sensations and subjective evaluations
of comfort/discomfort for touched objects. They identified
phonemes associated with comfort and discomfort
respectively. In the same way as tactile perception, humans
can richly perceive variations of taste. However, the
relationships among taste categories have not been clearly
described. Using the method proposed by Watanabe et al.
(2012), we found /a/, /sy/, /h/, and /s/ had a statistically
significant relationship to comfort and /i/, /g/, /z/, /b/, /d/,
/n/, and /Ø/ were significantly related to discomfort and
showed the possibility to clarify taste categories using
sound symbolic method.

Previous studies (e.g. Yamanashi, 1988) have suggested
that, unlike touch, taste is not expressed by onomatopoeic
words and, if any, onomatopoeic words used for taste are
expressing food texture, which is a kind of tactile
perception. Our results showed that the SD scales related to
texture such as “sparkling”, “smooth”, “good texture” and
“comfortable” were the most frequently categorized into
phonemes of onomatopoeic words. Therefore, as previous
studies have suggested, onomatopoeic words expressing
food texture are more easily used for emotional evaluations
in taste than those expressing taste itself. However, we
found a strong association between phonemes and some SD
scales related to taste itself. For example, vowels and
consonants /n/, /i/, and /o/ were significantly related to
“bitter-not bitter”. The vowel /i/ was significantly related to
“sweet-not sweet”. Furthermore, the consonants /s/, /g/
were significantly related to “salty-not salty”. This means
that evaluations of taste can be symbolized by phonemes of
Japanese onomatopoeic words. We therefore showed that
sound symbolic words could be important indexes in
investigating various level of perceptual dimension of taste
including emotional evaluations like comfort/discomfort.

Conclusion
This study investigated sound symbolism in taste through
psychological experiments and showed that sound symbolic
words could be important indexes in investigating various
level of perceptual dimension of taste including emotional
evaluations like comfort/discomfort. Since sound
symbolism is observed in languages of the world, whether
the findings of this study are universal or not is an issue
awaiting further investigation.
