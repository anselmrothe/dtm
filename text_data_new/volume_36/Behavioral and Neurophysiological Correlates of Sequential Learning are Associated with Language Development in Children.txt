Abstract
Sequential learning (SL) is believed to be an essential
component of language development. Despite support from
behavioral studies, neural evidence of this relationship,
especially in children, is scarce. The current study measured
7-12-year-olds’ ERPs to a visual SL task involving incidental
learning of probabilistic relationships between predictors and
targets presented within a serial input stream. Various aspects
of language and cognitive development were assessed with
standardized tests. Results on the SL task showed that
children demonstrated SL as determined by differences in
ERP amplitudes and response times for predictor conditions
that varied with the probability of predicting the target.
Crucially, the amplitude of ERP difference waveforms was
positively correlated with language ability and cognitive
control. These findings validate the use of a probabilistic
visual predictor-target task to investigate SL in children and,
most importantly, provide neural evidence of a close
relationship between SL, language development and cognitive
control.

Introduction
Spoken language development depends upon basic
processing mechanisms that encode structural regularities in
the input (e.g., Gervain and Mehler, 2010; Gogate &
Hollich, 2010; Kuhl, 2004; Saffran, Senghas & Trueswell,
2001; Ullman, 2004). One such mechanism, structured
sequence processing or sequential learning (SL), is used to
learn about structured patterns of information in the
environment that unfold over time (Conway et al., 2010;
Conway & Pisoni, 2008; Saffran, 2003; Udden & Bahlman,
2012). SL can take place through any sensory modality and
is used across multiple domains, including language and
communication, motor and skill learning, music perception
and production, problem solving, and planning (e.g.,
Conway et al., 2011; Conway, Pisoni, & Kronenberger,
2009).
In particular, research suggests that SL is an essential
component of language development. For example, in a
recent study of deaf children with cochlear implants,

Conway et al. (2011) found that children’s scores on a
visual SL task were positively correlated with their scores
on a standardized measure of verbal language ability
involving syntax, even after controlling for verbal shortterm memory and vocabulary skill (also see Conway,
Pisoni, & Kronenberger, 2009). In addition, Shafto,
Conway, Field, and Houston (2012) demonstrated an
empirical link between visual sequence learning and
vocabulary development in typically hearing infants.
However, neural evidence for the relationship between SL
and language processing, especially in children, is scarce.
One exception is Christiansen, Conway, and Onnis (2012),
who measured event-related potentials (ERPs) while adult
participants performed both a SL task and a language
processing task. They found that both tasks elicited a centroparietal late latency ERP component, called the P600, when
structural incongruities were encountered. As this
component is known to be an index of syntactic processing
in natural language, it was concluded that the same neural
mechanisms may be recruited for both syntactic processing
of linguistic stimuli and more general SL processes. Even
so, this study focused on adults only, and so it remains an
open question as to whether the same relationship between
the neural mechanisms of SL and language processing holds
true for children.
In an attempt to extend this research to examine the
possible connection between the neural mechanisms of SL
and language ability in children, we measured ERPs in 19
children aged 7-12 years while performing a visual SL task.
These children were also administered a number of
standardized neuropsychological assessments that measured
language development, cognitive ability, and executive
function.
The SL task was modified from the task used by Jost et. al
(2011) that was used to investigate the neurophysiological
correlates of visual statistical learning in adults and children.
Jost et al.’s (2011) task in turn was based on the classic
visual oddball paradigm, modified to include sequential
regularities between a predictor and a target. Participants
viewed a stream of visual stimuli that included targets to
which participants were instructed to respond by pressing a

2115

button. Participants were not told that embedded in this
stimulus stream were predictor stimuli that predicted the
occurrence of the target with varying levels of probability
(high, low, and zero probability). Jost et al. (2011)
demonstrated that children and adults’ learning of the
transitional probabilities between predictors and targets
embedded within the serial input patterns elicited a mid- to
late-latency (between 300 to 600ms post-predictor onset)
centro-parietal positivity. This ERP component was elicited
specifically by the high-probability predictor that was the
strongest predictor of the upcoming target.
For the present study, we used a similar SL task modified
to be more child-friendly by making it into a game with a
background story (i.e., the “magician” task). Like Jost et al.
(2011), we measured ERPs time-locked to each predictor
presentation. In addition, we administered a number of
assessments of language and other cognitive abilities in an
attempt to determine whether performance on these
assessments was correlated with the above-mentioned ERP
index of SL.

Each stimulus was presented on screen for 500ms on a
black background, followed by a black screen for 500ms
(Stimulus Onset Asynchrony: 1000ms). There were 60 trials
in each experimental condition presented in pseudorandom
order in 6 blocks of 30 trials each. Blocks were interspersed
with 30s breaks during which children watched a stopaction cartoon related to the magician story.

Method
Participants
Nineteen typically developing and hearing children between
the ages of 7 and 12 years (M = 8.95 years; 9 female)
participated. Two additional participants were excluded, one
due to software failure, and one due to inability to reduce
impedances to 50 kΩ. All children were recruited from the
Atlanta metropolitan area.

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the sequential
learning task. The target followed the high predictor on 90%
of high predictor trials but only on 20% of low predictor
trials. In the no-predictor condition, the target was presented
immediately after a standard with no preceding predictor.

Sequential Learning Task
Children were told a story about an inconsistent magician
who tried to make food for his children using his magic hat.
Participants were told to “catch” the sporadically presented
food by pressing a button. Children then viewed a stream of
stimuli consisting of hats of different colors presented one at
a time. Occasionally, a target hat with food depicted above
it was presented within the stream. Unbeknownst to
participants, hats of three different colors each differentially
predicted the occurrence of the target hat, which we refer to
as high-probability predictors, low-probability predictors,
and standards. When the high-probability predictor was
presented, it was immediately followed by the target 90% of
the time and the standard 10% of the time. The lowprobability predictor was followed by the target 20% of the
time and the standard 80% of the time. In addition, the
target was occasionally presented directly after a standard
without a preceding predictor (referred to as no-predictor).
Figure 1 shows a schematic of the sequence learning task.
If children learned either implicitly or explicitly, the
transitional probabilities between each type of predictor and
the target, it was expected that there would be differences in
both response times (RTs) to the targets and ERPs to the
predictors based on whether a trial was a high-probability,
low-probability, or no-predictor trial. Either of these
differences would constitute evidence of sequence learning.

ERP Recording and Analysis
ERPs reflecting stimulus-time-locked changes in electrical
potential on the scalp during the SL task were collected
using a 32-channel sensor net and processed using Net
Station Version 4.3.1 (Electrical Geodesics, Inc.).
Impedances were kept below 50 kΩ. Data were acquired
with a 0.1 to 30 Hz bandpass filter and digitized at 250 Hz.
ERPs were time-locked to the onset of each predictor
stimulus or in the case of the no-predictor condition, the
standard that preceded the target (epochs: -200ms to
+1500ms). This resulted in 60 trials for each of the three
predictor conditions (high-probability, low-probability, and
no-predictor). Automatic rejection was applied for eye
blinks, movements, and other artifacts. Data from channels
with poor signals were replaced with data extrapolated from
surrounding channels using a bad channel replacement
operation. Channels were grouped into 7 regions of interest
(ROIs) containing four sensors each (see Figure 2): frontal,
left anterior, right anterior, central, left posterior, centroposterior, and right posterior. Data from the facial sensors
were not included in analyses due to electrooculogram
noise.
Neuropsychological Assessments
Children’s receptive vocabulary was assessed using the

2116

that RTs for high-probability predictor trials (M = 420 ms,
SD = 88) were significantly faster than those for the nopredictor trials (M = 490 ms, SD = 86; p = .029). The lowprobability predictor mean RT (M =471 ms, SD = 70) was
not significantly different from that for either the highprobability predictor (p = .101) or no-predictor (p = .293)
conditions. These response time analyses suggest that
participants learned the transitional probabilities between
the high-probability predictor and the target.
ERPs
Visual inspection of the grand-averaged ERPs for the three
predictor conditions (Figure 3) revealed a centro-parietal
late (between about 300-750 ms) positivity similar to a P300
component that increased with the transitional probability
between predictors and targets.
Figure 2: ROI mapping. The centro-posterior ROI is shaded.
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition (PPVT-4;
Dunn & Dunn, 2007). Two subtests of the Comprehensive
Assessment of Spoken Language (CASL; CarrowWoolfolk, 1999) were also administered as assessments of
language development: Grammaticality Judgment, in which
children are asked to judge sentences’ grammatical
correctness; and Sentence Completion, wherein sentences
are read without their final word , and children are asked to
give a semantically and grammatically correct word ending.
Short-term and working memories were assessed with the
Forward and Backward Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition Integrated
(WISC-IV Integrated; Kaplan et al., 2004). Spatial ability
was assessed with the Block Design subtest of the WISC-IV.
Finally, executive function and cognitive control were
assessed with the Stroop Color and Word Test: Children’s
Version (Golden, Freshwater, & Golden, 2002). This test
takes advantage of the well-known Stroop Effect. Children
read as many color words (red, blue, and green) in a list as
they can in 45 seconds, then name as many colors (red, blue,
and green) as they can in 45 seconds, and finally name the
incongruent ink color in which color-words are written as
many times as possible in 45 seconds. This test measures
the degree of inhibitory control to semantic interference
between automatic and controlled semantic processing.

Results
Statistical Analyses
Repeated-measures ANOVAs were Greenhouse-Geissercorrected for sphericity when appropriate. Posthoc tests
were Sidak-corrected for multiple testing.
Response Times.
A one-way repeated measures ANOVA comparing mean
RT by predictor type (high-probability, low-probability, nopredictor) revealed a significant effect of predictor type
(F(1.359, 24.459) = 6.482, p = .011). Posthoc tests showed

Figure 3: Grand-averaged ERP in the centro-posterior ROI
(Figure 2) to high-probability (triangles), low-probability
(circles), and no-predictor (squares) trials (Positivity upward
in microVolts; time in milliseconds).
A repeated measures ANOVA with Predictor (high, low,
and no) and ROI (Figure 2) within-participants factors on
the mean ERPs in the 300-750ms post-predictor onset
window showed a Predictor X ROI interaction (F(2.910,
52.381) = 3.727, p = .018).
A repeated measures ANOVA comparing the three
predictor conditions (high, low, and no) conducted on ERPs
from only the centro-posterior ROI showed a significant
effect of predictor (F(1.30, 25.12) = 6.36, p = .011).
Posthocs showed a larger positivity to high-probability
predictors (M = 3.77 µV, SD = 2.02) than to no predictor
trials (M = -0.22 µV, SD = 5.15; p = .038) and a marginally
significant higher positivity to high-probability predictors
(M = 1.55 µV, SD = 3.42) than to low-probability predictor
trials (p = .085). ERPs did not differ significantly between
the low-probability predictor and no-predictor conditions
during this window (p = .183). These neurophysiological
data suggest that children learned the transitional
probabilities between predictors and targets. These findings
roughly parallel the behavioral findings and validate the use
of ERPs as a measure of learning in this task.
Neuropsychological Assessments
Means and standard deviations for all neuropsychological
assessments are reported in Table 1. Mean scores on all

ERP Effects and Neuropsychological Assessments. The
low-no ERP effect was significantly positively correlated
with the CASL Sentence Completion standard scores (ρs(16)
= .502, p = .034), and marginally positively correlated with
the Stroop Interference T-Score (ρ(16) = .416, p = .054). In
addition, the high-no ERP effect was significantly positively
correlated with the Stroop Interference T-Score (ρs(16) =
.539, p = .021). These results suggest that better SL, as
indexed by greater differences between high- and lowprobability predictor ERP amplitudes and the baseline (nopredictor) ERP amplitude, are associated with: (1) greater
ability to complete the last word of a sentence based on
previous sentence context (Sentence Completion score) and
(2) greater cognitive control and flexibility (Stroop
Interference score).

Discussion

Correlations
The no-predictor condition provides a baseline-measure for
RTs and ERPs given no warning that the target was about to
be presented. Thus, a decreased RT or an ERP deviation
from these baselines on low- and high-probability predictor
trials ought to reflect SL. To compare levels of learning, we
created difference scores between the no-predictor and lowprobability predictor and between the no-predictor and highprobability predictor for both the mean response times and
mean ERP amplitudes. Response time difference scores and
amplitude difference scores for the centro-posterior region
were then correlated with each other and with
neuropsychological assessment scores using a Spearman’s
correlation (see Table 2). This non-parametric statistic was
used because the small sample size may mean that data are
not normally distributed. Correlations among different
neuropsychological tests are not of main interest in the
present study and therefore are not reported in the text. In
addition, age was not significantly correlated with any of the
SL measures, thus age was not included in further analyses.
Response Times. Response time difference score
correlations with both ERP wave differences and
neuropsychological assessments were non-significant. This
is likely related to high variability in children’s response
times due to any of the following: lack of motivation to
react as quickly as possible, responding to the predictor in

1

anticipation of the target once the transitional probabilities
had been learned, and variability in fine motor control.

One participant did not complete some of the
neuropsychological assessments resulting in an n of 19 for some
assessments and an n of 18 for others.

Results from this investigation confirm the primary findings
from the Jost et al. (2011) study: children’s ERPs show a
P300-like positivity between about 300ms to 750ms post
stimulus onset in response to predictors of varying
probability, with the positivity being greater for high
probability predictors compared to low probability or no
predictors. These findings validate the use of this type of
embedded predictor-target task as a way to examine the
behavioral and neural correlates of SL in children (as well
as adults). This paradigm thus paves the way for exploring
the developmental progression of SL mechanisms across the
lifespan and their relationship with language ability.
It is possible that differences in ERPs in comparison with
the baseline-measure may be exaggerated due to the known
increase in P300 to infrequent stimuli with respect to
frequent stimuli. This is true because although the high and
low predictors were presented an equal number of times, the
standard (no predictor) was presented much more
frequently. However, differences between conditions in
ERPs parallel the observed differences between conditions
in RT, which are not subject to the P300 effect. In addition,
Jost et al. (2011) did not have this potential confound and
yet presented similar ERP results. Thus, we believe these
ERP differences to reflect SL per se rather than frequencyencoding mechanisms.
The findings from the present study also revealed positive
relationships between the neurophysiological measures of
SL and two standardized assessments measuring language
development (i.e., Sentence Completion) and executive
function (i.e., Stroop Interference T-score). These
correlations are not just indicative of general cognitive level
as measures of memory and spatial cognition did not show
significant correlations with neurophysiological measures of
SL. Instead, these results are consistent with other recent
findings showing a connection between SL and both
language and cognitive control. For example, considering
the correlation with the Sentence Completion task first,

Conway et al. (2010) found that adults’ performance on a
visual SL task and performance on an auditory sentence
perception task that required implicit prediction of the final
word in a sentence were positively correlated. Conway et al.
(2010) concluded that the skill required for both tasks that
lead to their association was the ability to encode underlying
statistical structure contained in input sequences--both in the
visual SL task and in natural language—and then using such
knowledge to facilitate the processing of subsequent input
(also see Misyak, Christiansen, & Tomblin, 2010 for a
similar conclusion). In the same way, the correlation
observed in the present study between visual SL as
measured by differences in ERP amplitudes and the
Sentence Completion test suggests that children’s ability to
provide grammatically and semantically appropriate endings
to sentences is based in part on SL and implicit prediction
processes. However, we believe our results are the first
evidence of this relationship in children and the first
correlation of SL with a standardized assessment of
sentence prediction. Finding a relationship with a
standardized measure of sentence prediction is the first step
in fleshing out the clinical implications for developing
language interventions using SL.
The other correlation observed here, between ERP
correlates of SL and the Stroop Interference T-score, may
highlight the role of inhibitory processes required for both
tasks. In the Stroop task, a high interference t-score
translates to a low level of interference, meaning that the
participant is able to inhibit the automatic process of reading
color words in order to quickly name the incongruent color
of the ink in which the word is displayed. In the SL task,
learning the probabilistic contingencies between predictors
and targets may also require inhibition of responding to
non-relevant stimuli in the task. Interestingly, associations

between Stroop performance and language processing have
been found in healthy adults (January, Trueswell, &
Thompson-Schill, 2009) and in children with cochlear
implants (Conway et al., under revision). Likewise,
neuroimaging evidence suggests that sequence processing
and cognitive control both engage left frontal areas of the
brain (Bahlmann, Korb, Gratton, & Friederici, 2012).
However, to our knowledge, this is the first direct, withinsubject evidence of a link between neural correlates of SL
and a measure of cognitive control and flexibility. Future
research is needed to further elucidate the ways in which
language development, sequence processing, and cognitive
control are related.
Further research is also necessary to confirm the causal
nature of the relationships among these variables. The
current study shows only correlations only and does not
speak to the direction of the causal relationships or even
whether there are other unobserved variables that account
for associated performance on SL, language, and cognitive
control tasks. However, there is reason to believe that SL
does in fact causally impact language processing. Shafto et
al. (2012) recently showed that visual SL in 8.5 month-olds
predicted infants’ comprehension of communicative
gestures five months later, suggesting a causal link in which
better SL leads to better language development. On the
other hand, SL and receptive vocabulary were also
concurrently positively correlated at 8.5 months leaving
open the possibility that better language understanding
actually leads to better SL ability or that there is a third
variable underlying performance on both skills. Further
support for a causal relationship between SL and language
was found in a recent mediational analysis of adaptive
training of SL and its impact on language processing (Smith
et al., under review). We believe that a combination of

2119

longitudinal designs (as espoused by Arciuli & Torkildsen,
2012 and Conway et al., 2011) and training interventions
(Smith et al., under review) will provide further insight as to
the causal relationships among these constructs.
In conclusion, the findings of this study validate the use
of a modified visual oddball task to study SL in children.
These findings also support a growing body of evidence
suggesting a tight coupling between sequential learning,
language processing, and cognitive control (Bahlmann et al.,
2012; Christiansen et al., 2012; Conway et al., 2010;
Conway et al., 2011; January et al. 2009; Misyak et al.,
2010; Shafto et al., 2012). Importantly, we believe this
study contributes some of the only data that link neural
measures of such learning processes in children to
behavioral measures of language ability and cognitive
control, bringing us one step closer to elucidating the
multiple processes underlying language development.
