Abstract
This study proposed a design database consisting of creative
and noncreative designs for creative research and discussed
the correlation between creative assessment and brain activities
using fMRI. We answered the following two research questions: which brain areas are activated when assessing creative
designs in contrast to noncreative designs and does social evaluation influence creativity assessment based on subjective criteria. The left inferior and middle temporal gyri (BA 37) were
activated when assessing creative designs in contrast to noncreative designs. These activations suggest that an inference
process to understand meanings underlying creative designs is
important in creativity assessment. The left superior temporal
gyrus (BA 38) was more activated when assessing creative designs with inconsistent social evaluations than without social
evaluations; whereas, the decision behavior for creativity assessment was robust. This result suggests that the participants
might consider the intentions of evaluation of others when inconsistent social evaluations are presented.
Keywords: Creativity; Assessment; fMRI; Social evaluation.

Introduction
The manner of assessing creative products is one of the central issues when assessing creative ability, evaluating creative
process, and validating the effectiveness of creative education
(Plucker & Makel, 2010). Finke (1990) proposed a definition
of creativity rating along two dimensions: practicality and
originality. Creative inventions were defined as practical inventions that were rated as original (Finke, 1990; Finke et al.,
1992).
On the other hand, it has been pointed out that such definitions affect the validity of creativity which people feel intuitively to products (Amabile, 1982; Amabile et al., 1996).
Amabile (1982) hypothesized that “a product or response
is creative to the extent that appropriate observers independently agree it creative” and proposed the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) (Plucker & Makel, 2010). The CAT
requires judging products’ creativity based on the criteria of
one who has competence in related regions.

Cognitive Neuroscience Approach to Creativity
Assessment
Measuring a product’s creativity is among the most important aspects in studies of creative cognition; several aspects
have been developed as mentioned above. On the other hand,
it might be possible to reconsider creativity assessment from
the viewpoint of brain activities. In recent years, brain mechanisms underlying higher-order cognition including creative

cognition have been revealed with the development of brain
imaging techniques (Dietrich & Kanso, 2010; Fink et al.,
2007; Sawyer, 2011).
For example, Kowatari et al. (2009) discussed generative
processes of creative designs using fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging). They introduced an artistic task,
i.e., designing a new pen, and discussed correlations between
the creativity of products evaluated by indices of originality
and brain activities of generative processes. They confirmed
the hypothesis that training increases creativity via reorganized intercortical interactions.
Ellamil et al. (2012) also tried to distinguish between two
components of creative cognition, generation and evaluation
processes, at the neural level using fMRI. Participants were
required to design book cover illustrations while alternating between the generation and evaluation of ideas using an
fMRI-compatible drawing tablet. Their findings suggest that
the medial temporal lobe may be central to the generation
of novel ideas, and creative evaluation may extend beyond
deliberate analytical processes supported by executive brain
regions to include more spontaneous affective and visceroceptive evaluative processes supported by default and limbic
regions.
Creative research with a cognitive neuroscience approach
has examined both generation and evaluation processes in
creative cognition. However, most of the cognitive neuroscience research of creative cognition has focused on evaluation processes within generative processes; products for
evaluation were self-generated. However, there is little literature discussing correlations between creativity assessment
and brain activity. To conduct experiments focusing on creativity assessment, controlled stimulation is necessary.
Therefore, this study proposed a design database consisting
of both creative and noncreative designs for use in creativity assessment research. Moreover, we discussed differences
in brain activities between assessing creative and noncreative
designs.

Effects of Social Evaluation for Creativity
Assessment
Creativity assessment based on one’s own criteria might be
influenced by various cognitive biases because it is not possible to refer to objective criteria. Moreover, there are two different types of creative, p-creativity (psychological creativ-

ity), and h-creativity (historical creativity); they are sometimes confused (Boden, 2003). Therefore, the perspective
of social evaluation might bias creativity assessment as pcreativity.
There are many experimental studies in social psychology
about the influence of social evaluation on attitudes, beliefs,
and decision-making. Especially, conformity, which is the act
of matching attitudes, beliefs, and decision-making to group
norms, was confirmed through many social psychological
studies (Asch, 1955). Thus, creativity assessment based on
one’s own naı̈ve criteria might be influenced by social evaluations.
Therefore, this study discusses influences of social evaluation on assessing creative designs.

Purpose
This study aimed to develop a design database consisting of
both creative and noncreative designs to be used in creativity research. In addition to developing the database, we tried
to reveal the relationship between brain activities and creativity assessment. The following two research questions (RQs)
were addressed:
RQ1: Which brain areas are activated when assessing creative designs in contrast to noncreative designs?
RQ2: Does social evaluation influence creativity assessment
based on subjective criteria?

Design Database
The design database consists of 18 design categories, which
are items from daily life, and do not require specific knowledge to assess their creativity. Table 1 shows the list of items.
Each design was generated based on the procedure of the
design task introduced by Finke et al. (1992) known as one of
the typical design tasks in the study of creativity. As shown
in Figure 1, each category consists of four designs: three creative designs and one noncreative design.
Each design was gathered and refined by the following
three steps. First, twenty one undergraduates majoring in design were recruited to sketch objects’ design from the four
categories, which were randomly assigned to them. Second,
the authors sorted out these rough designs and refined them
based on previous criteria by mutual agreement. Finally, the
selected designs were converted to 3D modeling data to reduce habits of touch and to make them easy to use as experimental materials.

Experiment 1
In this experiment, we confirmed the validity of our database.

Methods
Participants One hundred and thirty three undergraduates
participated in the assessment experiment: 84, 24, and 23 undergraduates were assigned to perform assessment tests about
creativity, originality, and practicality of the test items.
Procedure The designs were randomized and presented to
the participants sequentially. The designs were rated along
three dimensions, using a 7-point scale. In the creativity assessment, the participants were required to assess the creativity of the designs according to each person’s own criteria. On
the other hand, in the originality assessment, the participants
were required to assess the originality of the items according
to the concrete criteria, i.e., “How original is the design from
the viewpoint of producing by one’s unique thought?” In the
practicality assessment, the participants were also required to
evaluate the practicality of the items according to the concrete
criteria, i.e., “How practical is the design from the viewpoint
of usefulness when it is actually used?”
Moreover, each assessment was repeated a week later to
ensure intrapersonal consistency in the creativity assessments
in contrast to the originality and practicality assessments.

Results
Two-way between-participants ANOVAs for the design factor (three creative designs and a noncreative design) and the
repetition factor (first assessment and second assessment) in
each category showed significant main effects of the design
factor (creativity: Fs(3, 249) > 35.12, ps < .001; originality: Fs(3, 69) > 51.48, ps < .001; practicality: Fs(3, 66) >
13.33, ps < .001). The multiple comparisons using Ryan’s
method showed that the creativity of the creative designs
was higher than that of the noncreative designs (ps < .05),
whereas a few category showed main effects of the repetition
factor and interactions. In the results of the originality assessment, the originality of the creative designs was also higher
than that of the noncreative designs (ps < .05). The results of
the practicality assessment showed that the practicality of the
noncreative designs was higher than those of the creative designs (ps < .05), whereas a few category showed main effects
of the repetition factor and interactions.
Next, we calculated intrapersonal assessment consistencies between the first and second assessment results using

Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. Figure 2
shows the average of intrapersonal assessment consistencies
in each assessment test. The result of the interpersonal consistence of the creativity assessment shows moderate correlation as well as both the originality and productivity assessments, although a one-way ANOVA for these intrapersonal assessment consistencies showed significant main effects (F(2, 128) = 4.21, p < .05, η2 = .06) and significant difference between the creativity and productivity assessments
(Ryan’s method, p < .05).
The results are summarized as follows: First, there are distinct differences in each assessment between the three creative designs and the noncreative design in each category.
Second, we confirmed the intrapersonal consistencies of creativity assessment according to subjective criteria similar to
originality and practicality assessments based on objectivelydefined criteria.

Experiment 2
Next, we revealed (1) differences in brain activities between
when a person was assessing creative and noncreative designs
and (2) influences of social evaluations (creative, noncreative,
and without evaluations) when assessing creative designs.

Methods
Participants Twenty healthy, right-handed undergraduate
students (18 to 21 years old; 9 males and 11 females) participated in this experiment. The participants were native
Japanese speakers and their handedness was assessed by a
modified Oldfield questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971). The participants provided written informed consent in accordance with
the research ethics committee guidelines of Nagoya University’s Research Institute of Environmental Medicine.
Design In the experiment, we focused on four conditions
based on two factors: creativity of designs and social evaluations of creative designs. Table 2 shows the matrices and four
experimental conditions.
The creativity of design factor included two levels: creative

and noncreative designs. The discussion of RQ1 was based
on a comparison between Table 2 (A) and (B).
On the other hand, the social evaluations of the creative
design factor included three levels. In the consistent condition, a social evaluation as “creative” for the creative designs
was presented. In the inconsistent condition, a social evaluation as “ordinary” for the creative designs was also presented.
In the none condition, no social evaluations were presented.
The discussion of RQ2 was based on comparisons between
Table 2 (B) and (C), and (B) and (D).
Procedure Participants were given a practice session using
two examples outside the MRI scanner. Following the practice session, they engaged in 72 trials while in the scanner.
The trials consisted of evaluating 54 creative designs and 18
noncreative designs.
Figure 3 illustrates the experimental sequence. Following a
fixation point and a category name, each design was presented
to the participants for up to approximately eight seconds. The
participants instructions were as follows: “Some designs had
been evaluated on their creativity by approximately a thousand raters. Therefore, if designs had evaluation results, the
evaluation results, creative or ordinary, would be presented
with the category names.” Category names for one-third of
54 creative designs received an added adjective, “creative,”
as did the results of social evaluation randomly (consistent
condition). In the same manner, category names for one-third
of the items received the added adjective, “ordinary” (inconsistent condition). The rest of the items were not presented
with such social evaluations (none condition).
Participants were required to press the corresponding buttons assigned to the index and middle fingers of their right
hand when deciding whether presented design was creative.
This sequence was repeated 72 times. The experiment consisted of two fMRI runs.
Imaging Data Acquisition Scans of the whole-brain images were acquired by using a gradient echo planar image
acquisition on a 3T MRI Scanner (Siemens Verio, Siemens
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The functional imaging parameters were TR = 2.5 s, TE = 30 ms, FA = 70◦ , VoF = 20
cm × 20 cm, and 39 slices. To avoid head movement, the
participants wore a neck brace and were asked not to talk or
move during the MRI scan. High-resolution anatomical im-

ages (T1) were also acquired by using gradient echo planar
image acquisition. We acquired T1 images (TR = 2.5 s, TE
= 2.48 ms, FA = 8◦ ) with 192 sagittal slices, each being 1
mm in thickness. Motion correction was also performed in a
standard realign process in SPM8.
Imaging Data Analysis The imaging data were analyzed
using SPM8. Each participants’ imaging data was individually preprocessed (realignment, slice time adjustment, normalization, smoothing) and the spatially preprocessed data
was then estimated to establish a random effects model. The
statistical threshold was set at p < .001, uncorrelated with an
extended threshold of 10 contiguous voxels.

Results
Behavioral Results Figure 4 shows the results of the average ratio of assessing the designs as creative. Figure 4 (a)
shows the results of the comparison between the noncreative
design and the creative design without social evaluation (corresponding to Table 2 (A) and (B)). Figure 4 (b) also shows
the results of the comparison among social evaluations: none,
consistent, and inconsistent (corresponding to Table 2 (B),
(C), and (D)).
A t-test detected a significant difference between the ratio
of assessing the designs as noncreative and creative as shown
in Figure 4 (a) (t(19) = 18.69, p < .000, r = 0.97).
On the other hand, a one-way between-participants
ANOVA for the social evaluation conditions (none, consistent, and inconsistent) showed no difference among them
(F(2, 39) = 0.80, p = .46, η2 = .04).

Imaging Results Next, we compared brain activities in
both the design and social evaluation factors.
The results of the contrasts between assessing the noncreative and creative designs are as follows.
Creative > Noncreative
This contrast examined the brain areas that were more activated during assessment for the creative designs than for the
noncreative designs. Several peaks of activation were found,
including left and right inferior temporal gyri (BA 37), left
middle temporal gyrus (left BA 37), right fusiform gyrus (BA
37), right middle occipital gyrus (BA 19), left inferior frontal
gyrus (BA 44), left superior frontal gyrus (BA 8), left middle
occipital gyrus (BA 18), right superior occipital gyrus (BA
19), and right middle temporal gyrus (BA19) (Table 3 (a)).
Figure 5 (a) depicts these areas of activation.
Noncreative > Creative
This contrast examined the brain areas that were more activated during assessment for the noncreative designs than for
the creative designs. Several peaks of activation were also
found, including left medial frontal gyrus (BA 9), left supramarginal gyrus (BA 40), left inferior temporal gyrus (BA 20),
right middle temporal gyrus (BA 21), and right supramarginal
gyrus (BA 40) (Table 3 (b)). Figure 5 (b) depicts these areas
of activation.
The results of the contrast between assessing the creative
designs without social evaluation and with the consistent social evaluation, and without social evaluation and with the
inconsistent social evaluation are as follows.
Inconsistent > None
This contrast examined the brain areas that were more activated during evaluation of the creative designs with the inconsistent social evaluation rather than for the creative designs without social evaluation. Several peaks of activation
were also found, including left superior temporal gyrus (BA
38) and left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 36) (Table 3 (c)).
Figure 5 (c) depicts these areas of activation.

experiment suggests that assessing creative designs required
even more uncertain decision-making than assessing noncreative designs.

Theory of Mind in Creativity Assessment
These comparisons showed that no voxels were activated.

Discussion and Conclusions
This study proposed a design database consisting of creative
and noncreative designs for creative research. The first experiment confirmed the validity of the creative and noncreative
designs.
We now discuss (1) brain areas related to creativity assessment and (2) effects of social evaluation when assessing creative designs.

Brain Areas Related to Creativity Assessment
The left inferior and middle temporal gyri (BA 37) were more
strongly activated when assessing creative designs rather than
noncreative designs. Several studies have reported that the
left inferior temporal gyrus (BA37) correlates with metaphor
processing (Rapp et al., 2004), attention to semantic relations
(McDermott et al., 2003), and deductive reasoning (Goel et
al., 1998). Our results suggest that an inference process to
understand design intents underlying creative designs is important in creativity assessment.
Moreover, the left superior frontal gyrus (BA8) was also
more activated when assessing creative designs rather than
noncreative designs. This area is involved in the management
of uncertainty. The fMRI study demonstrated that BA 8 activation occurs when test subjects experience uncertainty and
that with increasing uncertainty there is increasing activation
(Volz et al., 2005). This activation as demonstrated in our

The behavioral results showed that there was no significant
effect of social evaluation on creativity assessment behavior.
During the brain activity, there were significant activations in
brain areas when the inconsistent social evaluation was presented to the participants in contrast to when no social evaluation was presented: left superior temporal gyrus (BA 38)
and left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 36).
Previous research has revealed that the temporal pole relates to social and emotional processing including theory
of mind (Olson et al., 2007). For example, Grezes (2004)
reported temporal pole activations when participants were
asked to detect deception. Moll et al. (2002) also reported
temporal pole activations when participants were asked to
make moral decisions. Moreover, Carr et al. (2003) and
Völlm et al. (2006) reported temporal pole activations while
inferring the emotional state of others.
The left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 36) has been associated with many cognitive processes, including visuospatial
processing and episodic memory (Aminoff et al., 2013). For
example, Bar et al. (2008) proposed that this region should
instead be seen as intrinsically mediating contextual associations and not place/scene processing or episodic memory
exclusively. In their experiment, the parahippocampal gyrus
(BA 36) was significantly activated when participants were
shown colorful photographs of everyday scenes with strong
context between a foreground object and a background in
contrast to a weak context between them.
Our experimental results in this contrast are summarized

1572

as follows: First, the activation of the left superior temporal gyrus (BA 38) in the inconsistent condition indicates that
the participants considered the intentions of the evaluations of
others; whereas, the decision behavior for creativity assessment was robust. Second, the activation of the left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 36) in the inconsistent condition indicates that participants might assess creative designs with inconsistent social evaluation based on concrete contexts.

Limitations and Future Works
We proposed a design database consisting of creative and
noncreative designs for creative research. We also revealed
brain areas related to assessing creative designs and the influence of inconsistent social evaluation on creativity assessment of creative designs.
However, there are several limitations to our study. We
were not aware of the physical features related to the creativity of designs. Moreover, there was no evidence about the effects of social evaluations for noncreative designs despite discussing their effects on creative designs in our experiments.
