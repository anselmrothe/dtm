Wassmann & Dasen, 1998; Mishra, Dasen & Niraula, 2003;
Haun et al., 2011; inter alia) has given rise to two
competing interpretations. The use of particular frame types
may be acquired, and speech, along with other forms of
observable behavior, may play a role in its cultural
transmission (Levinson, 2003; Majid et al., 2004; Le Guen,
2011). Alternatively, the use of all major frame types may
be innately available population-independently and usage
preferences in both discourse and nonlinguistic cognition
reflect shallow, readily mutable ontogenetic adaptations to
factors of topography, population geography, literacy, and
education (Li & Gleitman, 2002; Li et al., 2011).
To test these competing hypotheses, we studied the use of
reference frames in discourse and recall memory in
members of 11 populations: speakers of six Mesoamerican
languages, two non-Mesoamerican indigenous languages,
and three varieties of Spanish, the dominant contact
language spoken in the same geographic region. These
studies apply designs to the largest number of populations
targeted in a single study of this nature to date that are
similar in kind to what has become standard in this line of
inquiry. A more important innovation, however, is the use
of mixed-models linear regression analysis to discern which
factors predict an individual participant’s behavior.

We present the results of two studies of the use of spatial
reference frames in speakers of 11 linguistic varieties. A
series of mixed-models linear regression analyses of the
responses to a referential communication task shows the
significant factors in predicting frame use to be the
participants’ first and second-language, their literacy, the
local topography and population density. This suggests that
language can play an irreducible role in the transmission of
practices of spatial reference and that such practices may be
diffused through language contact. However, in a recall
memory experiment, only speakers of varieties with an
egocentric linguistic bias preferred egocentric responses. Both
speakers of languages with a geocentric bias and speakers of
varieties without a clear bias preferred geocentric responses.
This unexpected finding is in line with a hypothetical mild
innate pan-simian bias for geocentric cognition, which can be
superseded by a learned egocentric bias.

Introduction
We present a large-scale investigation of the use of spatial
reference frames in language and nonlinguistic cognition in
speakers of 11 linguistic varieties of Mexico, Nicaragua,
and Spain. Spatial reference frames are coordinate systems
used to identify regions and directions in space. The axes of
the coordinate system may be modeled after those of the
body of an observer (egocentric frames), a reference entity
(allocentric intrinsic frames), or some environmental entity
or feature (allocentric extrinsic = geocentric frames).
The demonstration of a robust alignment between
population-specific preferences in the use of spatial
reference frames for small-scale space in discourse and
recall memory (Levinson, 1996, 2003; Pederson et al., 1998;

Frame use in discourse: Ball & Chair
We conducted a referential communication task (Clark &
Wilkes-Gibbs, 1990) to assess the use of reference frames in
discourse by members of the 11 populations.

Materials and method
The Ball and Chair (B&C) task is a photo-matching game
consisting of four sets of 12 photos depicting a ball and

212

chair in different spatial configurations. A dyad of speakers
sits side-by-side divided by a screen to prevent sharing of a
visual field. Each speaker has identical sets laid out in front
of them. One speaker (the ‘director’) then selects and
describes each photo so that the ‘matcher’ can select its
match from their set. Roles are reversed between sets.

the distribution of the dependent variables, we constructed a
spatial model that assigns to each director a point in octodimensional space based on the frequency with which they
used the eight types of descriptions. We then explored this
model using multi-dimensional scaling. In order to examine
how participants' responses clustered, pairwise distances
were calculated as the Manhattan distance between them. A
three-dimensional MDS model was computed. These
dimensions were paired with the original response matrix
and tested for correlations using Spearman’s Rho (Baayen,
2008). It was found that the first dimension correlated with
two of the response types: geocentric and relative. The
correlation with the set of geocentric responses was positive
(Spearman’s Rho:0.869, p<.001) and the correlation with
the set of relative frequencies was negative (Spearman’s
Rho: -0.840, p <.001). We also found a correlation between
the frequency of topological uses and the second dimension
of the MDS plot (Spearman’s Rho: -0.947, p<.001).
The MDS analysis shows that participants differentiate
themselves most strongly in their use of relative, geocentric
and topological descriptions. However, topological relations
are perspective-free and do not play a role in the further
analysis. We are now left to ask which factors predict the
use of relative and geocentric descriptions. We examined
this in a second step of the analysis.

Participants
Data is presented from 11 language groups: six from within
the Mesoamerican sprachbund, two indigenous languages
spoken just outside the sprachbund – Seri and Sumu, and
three varieties of Spanish. The Spanish-speaking
communities were selected to closely match the
demographics of the indigenous communities. Table 1
shows the localities of data collection, as well as the
distribution of sex and age.

Impact of the predictor variables In order to test which of
the predictor variables made significant independent
contributions to a dyad’s use of relative and geocentric
frames, we ran a series of logistic regression analyses with
the probability of a director choosing these frame types as
the dependent variable and first language (L1), second
language (L2) use, reading/writing frequency, education
level, local topography, and population density as
independent variables. Our data set contains too many
individual languages for parsimonious modeling, so
languages were grouped according to areal-linguistic
affiliation, creating a three-leveled categorical variable
grouping the languages of the Mesoamerican Sprachbund,
the two non-Mesoamerican indigenous languages, and the
three varieties of Spanish.
Reading and writing frequencies and education levels
were assessed on four-valued scales, L2-Spanish use on a
three-valued one. Population density and topography for
each field site and were calculated from census data (INE
2010; INEGI 2010; INIDE 2005) and maps (Hernández
Santana, Hubp, & Ortiz Pérez, 2007, p.c.). Density was
assessed as the population of each community divided by its
area according to Google Earth. Topography is treated as a
categorical variable based on elevation levels and broad
geomorphological features. We distinguished among
orogenic belts, volcanic belts, central high plateaus,
continental shelf, and coastal basins and transgressions.
We implemented generalized linear mixed-effects models
(Jaeger, 2008) using the ARM package in R (Gelman et al.,
2012) with individual language and dyad as random effects.

Coding
The directors’ locative descriptions were analyzed and
coded for frame use, using an eight-way classification:
allocentric intrinsic, egocentric intrinsic, allocentric
extrinsic (geocentric), egocentric extrinsic (‘relative’),
gravitational geocentric (vertical), intrinsic-vertical aligned,
intrinsic-relative aligned, and topological (frame-free).
Aligned descriptions are true in multiple frame types
(Carlson-Radvansky & Irwin, 1993).

Analysis
To keep the director constant, we limited the following
analyses to sets 2 and 4 of the task. In order to investigate

213

In total, twelve models were run. Six models were run per
independent variable: geocentric uses and relative uses.
We ran separate models based on the participants’ selfestimates of their literacy and education levels and
frequency of reading, writing, and (for the speakers of the
indigenous languages) use of L2-Spanish and on the field
researchers’ estimates of the same values based on their
individual knowledge of the communities and participants.
We found only one major discrepancy between these data
subsets: there was an effect of L2-Spanish use in the models
based on self-reported participant data (summarized in
Table 2), but not in those based on researcher estimates. The
models that included L2-Spanish use as a predictor variable
excluded L1-Spanish speakers.

principal limiting factors in such instances are sample size
and the types of variables involved.

Frame use in recall memory: New Animals
We also conducted a recall memory experiment with
members of the 11 populations, employing the array
reconstruction paradigm (Levinson, 1996, 2003; Levinson et
al., 2002; Li & Gleitman, 2002; Wassman & Dasen, 1998;
Mishra et al., 2003; Haun et al., 2011). This paradigm tests
the preference for egocentric vs. geocentric reconstruction
of stimulus arrays from memory after the participant’s body
has undergone rotation. Preference designs do not assess the
participants’ ability to use particular frame types (Li et al.,
2011). However, the usage or practice of spatial reference
has been as much at the heart of the neo-Whorfian debate as
the ability to acquire and use different strategies. Usage is in
part a matter of culture, and the question to what extent
spatial cognition is influenced by culture is a point of
significant controversy between the opponent camps in the
debate.

Individuals are shown a row of three toy animals. When
they signal that they have memorized the array, it is taken
away. After a delay of 30-60 seconds, they are rotated 180°
and led to another table, where they are handed four animals
and asked to recreate the array. Participants performed six
trials each, and researchers recorded the order and facing
direction of the reconstructed arrays.

Results and discussion

Coding

All 11 linguistic varieties are lexically and grammatically
compatible with the use of all major reference frame types.
Therefore, the selection of a frame type in response to a
given picture was not constrained by the lexicon or grammar
of any of the languages. We can thus ask to what extent this
choice was predicted by the speaker’s native language, their
use of a second language, or the nonlinguistic variables Li
and Gleitman suggest. The variables that made a significant
independent contribution to predicting the probability of a
relative or geocentric description of a given picture in at
least some of the models were first language group
(Mesoamerican vs. non-Mesoamerican indigenous vs.
Spanish variety), the frequency of use of Spanish as a
second language, the frequency of writing, and the two
geographic variables. Correlations at or above .6 solely
occurred between population density and several levels of
the topography variable (in most models) and between the
Mesoamerican
and
non-Mesoamerican
indigenous
languages (in one model). In these cases, even if the
algorithm picked one of the correlating variables as
producing a significant effect to the exclusion of the other,
in actual fact it was not considered possible to reliably
distinguish between the effects of the two variables. The

Responses were coded for orientation and order of animals
(options were geocentric, egocentric, or neither). Three
possible error types were: (1) neither order, (2) neither
orientation, (3) wrong animal selection. Trials with error
types 1 and 3 were excluded from analysis, as were all trials
for participants who performed more than 2 of these errors.
20 percent of participants (36 of 184) were excluded for
these errors. 13 percent of trials (101 of 786) were excluded
for these errors.

Analysis
We ran linear mixed effects analyses using the ARM
package in R, testing the probability of egocentric and
geocentric reconstructions as the dependent variable. We
ran two models for each variable, modeling literacy on selfestimated reading vs. writing frequency. We tested for the
same range of independent variables as in the models of the
linguistic data discussed above. Table 3 summarizes the
findings.

between frame use in linguistic and nonlinguistic tasks
across languages might suggest. However, if the
contribution of language to frame use in the Ball and Chair
study could be reduced to the covariation between language
and the nonlinguistic variables Li and Gleitman (2002)
suggest, then our regression models should not have found a
significant language group effect at all. We hypothesize that
language plays a significant role in frame use because
speech is an observable behavior that can serve in the
cultural transmission of practices of spatial reference, along
with other observable behaviors, such as gesture (Le Guen,
2011).
This view of language as a transmission system for
cognitive practices neither entails nor precludes the
existence of language-on-thought effects from knowledge of
the grammars and lexicons of the languages of the world
(knowledge as opposed to use, or competence as opposed to
performance). To distinguish this view from (weak (nondeterministic) or strong (deterministic)) interpretations of
the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, we propose the
Linguistic Transmission Hypothesis (LTH): “Using any
language or linguistic variety – independently of its
structures – may facilitate the acquisition of cultural
practices of nonlinguistic cognition shared among the
speakers of the language.” Bohnemeyer et al. (ms.) cite
Levinson (2003: 210-213; 301-325) as a precursor of the
LTH. Spatial frames of reference afford a particularly
suitable test case for the LTH, since they are not lexicalized
or grammaticalized in language, but rather are themselves
cognitive practices that underlie the interpretation of both
linguistic and nonlinguistic spatial representations.
Direct support for the LTH comes from the impact of the
familiarity with the use of Spanish as a second language we
observed. The speakers of the indigenous languages in our
sample used relative frames more frequently in their native
languages the more frequently they also used Spanish as a
second language. This points toward habituation to the use
of relative frames diffusing through contact with European
languages such as Spanish. To our knowledge, our study has
produced the first quantitative evidence of the diffusion of
linguistic and cognitive practices through language contact.
Literacy, assessed in terms of the frequency of reading
and writing, was also a significant predictor of frame use.
This variable makes a significant independent contribution
to the use of geocentric frames, but not to that of relative
ones. High levels of literacy seem to depress the use of
geocentric frames. This confirms earlier findings (Danziger
& Pederson, 1998).

Results and discussion
Correlations above .6 occurred between education and
reading/writing and between population density and several
levels of the topography variable. Some topography levels
also correlated with one another in some models. Our
models cannot reliably distinguish between effects of the
correlated variables.
The models of the probability of geocentric
reconstructions show language group, topography, and
writing to be significant independent factors. This suggests
that language is an influence on frame choice in recall
memory that cannot be reduced to covariation with
nonlinguistic variables, contra Li and Gleitman (2002) and
in line with the neo-Whorfian hypothesis of Levinson
(1996) and others.
However, the only predictor variable that produced a
significant effect in the models of the probability of
egocentric reconstructions was writing. Topography played
a marginally significant role. There was, however, no
significant language effect.
The explanation for the absence of a linguistic effect in
the egocentric models is not hard to find: 10 of the 11
populations – all except for the European Spanish speakers showed a preference for geocentric responses. There was
thus a bias in favor of geocentric coding in the recall
memory task that cut across our three language groups. The
presence of a preference for geocentric reconstructions
among Mexican and Nicaraguan Spanish speakers is not
predicted by the neo-Whorfian hypothesis, since these
populations did not show a preference for geocentric
representations in the linguistic task.

A pan-simian geocentric bias?
To further probe the geocentric array reconstructions not
predicted by linguistic data from members of the same
populations, consider Table 4, which presents data collected
with both tasks from members of five Spanish-speaking
populations, including three groups of Mexican Spanish
speakers. The three Mexican Spanish data sets were
collected in small rural communities outside Mexico City.

General discussion
The Linguistic Transmission Hypothesis
Our studies have shown language to be far from the only
significant determinant of frame use, as an orthodox
Whorfian interpretation (Whorf, 1956) of the alignment

215

These communities were selected to meet three criteria:
absence of (i) current and (ii) historical contact with
indigenous languages and (iii) comparability with the
indigenous communities of our sample in socio-economic
terms and in terms of average literacy and education levels.
The recall memory data included in the models presented
above is that collected in San Miguel Balderas in Mexico
State. As Table 4 shows, referential communication data
collected from five dyads in the same community show a
preference for intrinsic coding over both relative and
geocentric coding. This data was not included in the models
of the linguist data presented above, since the participants
did not switch roles between trials in the same way in which
this was done with the other populations, making it
impossible to match productions to speaker data in the way
required by the models. The Mexican Spanish data we used
in the linguistic models was recorded in Chimalacatlán,
Morelos.

A third Mexican Spanish data set was collected in Santa
Ines, Mexico State, comprising both linguistic (three dyads)
and recall memory data. As the table shows, these
participants preferred relative representations in discourse,
just as the European Spanish speakers, and egocentric array
reconstructions, again just as the Europeans. This data was
not included in the models because we did not collect
information about the participants’ levels of literacy and
education. These participants were tested in the very
beginning of the project, before the analyses presented
above were conceived. Since recruitment had been
anonymous, we were unable to go back to the participants
later and instead had to rerun the tasks with new
participants, giving rise to the other two data sets. A
Fisher’s exact test shows the distribution of egocentric and
geocentric reconstructions across speakers from Barcelona
and Santa Ines, which prefer relative coding in language, vs.

216

Rosita (Nicaragua) and San Miguel, which do not, to be
highly significant (one-tailed p < .0001).
The Nicaraguan L1-Spanish-speaking participants
produced a pattern similar to the one of the speakers from
San Miguel Balderas: there was no clear evidence of a bias
in the linguistic task, with relative and intrinsic descriptions
occurring equally frequently. Yet geocentric reconstructions
were preferred over egocentric ones. This is not unlike the
distributions observed in the indigenous languages. The
only indigenous group that produced predominantly
geocentric responses in both studies was the Isthmus
Zapotec speakers. In all other populations, intrinsic
responses dominated over geocentric ones in the referential
communication task, with relative responses in second place
among the Seri speakers and in third behind geocentric ones
in all other groups. Yet, all of these populations preferred
geocentric array reconstructions.
Previous studies already noticed this mismatch in Yucatec
speakers, beginning with Bohnemeyer and Stolz (2006). Le
Guen (2011) hypothesizes a gesturally rather than verbally
transmitted geocentric bias, whereas Bohnemeyer (2011)
postulates task specificity. However, neither of these
proposals predicts the distribution observed in the present
study.
A possible explanation in line with all the data presented
here – and, as far as we know, with all available evidence
concerning the use of reference frames across populations –
comes from research on non-human primates. Haun et al.
(2006) present evidence pointing toward geocentric
representations of small-scale space being processed more
accurately than egocentric representations in recall memory
in all five genera of great apes and in German preschoolers.
They suggest that this presumably innate bias may be
superseded in specific human populations by a learned,
culturally transmitted egocentric bias.
Supporting evidence for an innate, but nevertheless
malleable geocentric bias comes from developmental
studies, which suggest that children growing up in
geocentric populations acquire geocentric terms very early,
possibly even before topological relations (Brown, 2001;
Brown & Levinson, 2000, 2009; de Leon, 1994). Spatial
cognition in animals may have evolved primarily for the
task of tracking the position of the animal and other animals
vis-à-vis the environment. The egocentric perspective may
be more useful for organisms with a human-like degree of
control over their immediate environment. Since the
computational primitives involved in calculating all frame
types are the same – axes, angles, and distances – this
system originally “designed” for geocentric coding would
be easily reconfigurable for egocentric cognition.
In combination with the Linguistic Transmission
Hypothesis, the hypothetical innate, but malleable
geocentric bias correctly predicts our data: only the
populations that show a relative bias in the linguistic task
also prefer egocentric array reconstructions, whereas all
other populations prefer geocentric coding in recall
memory.
