Abstract
The process of learning a language requires that long-term
memory stores the meanings of thousands of words encountered across a variety of situations. These word meanings
form a network of associations that, influenced by environmental factors such as word frequency and contextual diversity, cause behavioral effects on measures such as lexical decision and naming times. We investigate the development of
recognition priming as a function of explicit knowledge after
repeated training and testing on a novel vocabulary. By varying the word frequency and contextual diversity of the training input, and examining learning trajectories as well as semantic knowledge effects, we shed light on which environmental factors most influence performance in language acquisition. Contextual diversity and entropy–the uncertainty
about a word’s referents–are the two strongest factors predicting primed recognition times, and play a role along with frequency and context familiarity in predicting explicit learning.

Introduction
Learning a language is an impressive feat for many reasons,
not least of which is the fact that long-term memory stores
the meanings of thousands of words–over 12,000 are known
at the age of 6 years, while some 60,000 will be known by
the end of high school (Bloom, 2000). Short-term laboratory studies have elucidated many of the attentional, learning,
and memory mechanisms that contribute to word learning.
One important idea has been that of cross-situational learning, which posits that people can learn word meanings by
accumulating word-referent co-occurrences from utterances
across varying scenes. For example, a learner may hear two
novel words w1 and w2 while playing with some new toys
o1 , o2 , o3 . Later that day, the learner may hear w3 along with
w1 , while attending to o2 and o3 . If the learner can remember the prior co-occurrence of w1 and o2 , she may not only
strengthen that association, but also learn that w3 may refer
to o3 . Numerous studies have found that adults, children, and
even infants can learn nouns via this type of cross-situational
training (Yu & Smith, 2007; Smith & Yu, 2008). Adults often
perform well despite great uncertainty: 18 pairs to be learned
from four word-object pairs at a time, across only five minutes of training. This ability has been modeled using a variety
of disparate assumptions about how people store and retrieve
possible meanings, ranging from storing mutually-exclusive
word-referent hypotheses (Medina, Snedeker, Trueswell, &

Gleitman, 2011) that interact only at storage, to storing memory associations between each word and many referents that
compete at storage and retrieval (Yu, 2008; Kachergis, Yu, &
Shiffrin, 2012).
Associative models seems more suitable for learning a lexicon, in general, for words are thought not to be stored in
isolation, but rather forming a network of associations between both perceptual and verbal contexts, allowing us to
define concepts both concrete (e.g., dog) and abstract (e.g.,
justice). The growth and structure of the semantic network
deserves study in its own right, and network analyses have
provided insights into how concepts may be added over time
both in adults (Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005) and developmentally (Beckage, Smith, & Hills, 2011). However, there
is little empirical evidence for how quickly these semantic
associations form during cross-situational training. The closest empirical work is that of Nelson and Shiffrin (2013), in
which participants studied novel Chinese characters during
several sessions spanning a few weeks, and showed semantic
knowledge with frequency and context effects in a pseudolexical decision task. The present study looks for evidence of
semantic knowledge developing on an even shorter timescale,
conditioned on what explicit lexical knowledge learners manage to acquire during cross-situational training.
Most cross-situational learning experiments provide only
one opportunity for measuring knowledge: at the final test,
where each word is presented once and an object must be selected. In the present study, we give participants the same
block of training trials four times, along with a test between
each training block, allowing us to measure individual learning trajectories. In addition to choosing the best object for
each word, participants were given a final test of primed
pseudo-lexical decision: participants would hear a word, followed immediately by seeing two objects, from which they
must quickly choose the studied object. Although this experiment is still quite short in comparison to the typical timescale
of real-world language learning, we hope that it will afford
us a glimpse at the early development of a lexicon: a system of words learned via accumulated statistical learning.
In Experiments 2 and 3, we use a similar design but with
different training input. We vary word frequency, which is
known to vary widely in the natural language environment
(Zipf, 1949), and which correlates with speed-ups in lexical
decision times (Scarborough, Cortese, & Scarborough, 1977;
Balota & Chumbley, 1984). We also vary contextual diver-

sity (CD), the number of other pairs a given pair appears
with across training, which is partially-confounded with frequency and has also been shown to influence word-learning
(Kachergis, Yu, & Shiffrin, 2009). In summary, we investigate the impact of various environmental factors on both
word-learning trajectories and resulting semantic knowledge.

Experiment 1
Participants were asked to simultaneously learn many wordreferent pairs from a series of individually ambiguous training trials using the cross-situational word-learning paradigm.
Each training trial was comprised of a display of four novel
objects with four spoken pseudowords. With no indication
of which word refers to which object, learners had a small
chance of guessing the four correct word-referent pairings.
However, since a word always appeared on trials with their
intended referents, the correct pairings may be learned over
the series of trials. In this experiment, we measure learning trajectories by having participants complete four identical
training and test blocks, containing the same 18 word-object
pairs. Each training block consisted of 27 training trials, allowing each word-object pair to be displayed six times, with
four pairs per trial.

Participants
Participants were 66 undergraduates at Indiana University
who received course credit for participating.1

Stimuli
Each training trial showed an array of four unusual objects (e.g., uncommon tools) while four pseudowords were
heard. Eighteen computer-generated pseudowords that are
phonotactically-probable in English (e.g., “manu”) were spoken by a synthetic monotone female voice. These 18 objects
and 18 words were randomly paired for each learner.
Each training block consisted of the same 27 trials. Each
training trial began with the appearance of four objects, which
remained visible for the entire trial. After 2 seconds of initial
silence, each 1 second word was heard (randomly-ordered)
followed by two additional seconds of silence, for a total duration of 14 seconds per trial. The training trials were presented in the same order for each block. No pairs were allowed to appear in consecutive trials, constraining the use of
working memory to easily infer correct pairings.

Procedure
After each training block, participants were tested for knowledge of word meanings. A single word was played on
each test trial, and all 18 referents were displayed (i.e.,
18-alternative forced-choice; 18AFC). Participants were instructed to click on the correct referent for the word. Each
of the 18 words was presented once, and the test trials were
randomly ordered in each block. Learners were not told that
1 For all experiments, none had participated in other crosssituational experiments.

they would be seeing the same trials or even the same stimuli multiple times, but completed four train-test blocks with a
short instruction break between each.
A surprise primed 2AFC recognition task was given after
the final vocabulary test. Consisting of 54 trials, each trained
word was presented twice, along with 18 novel words. On
each trial, a single word was heard, immediately followed
by two objects displayed side by side. Participants were instructed to quickly indicate which object was one they had
been trained on (i.e., 2AFC recognition), regardless of what
the word was. Each object appeared three times as a target: once after its referring word (after co-occuring 24 times),
once after a spuriously co-occurring word (0-16 times), and
once after a novel word (0 co-occurrences).

Results and Discussion
Data from 12 participants were removed because their mean
performance on all four vocabulary tests was not above
chance (.056 for 18AFC). Data from the remaining 54 participants was analyzed. On average, participants steadily accumulate knowledge, with mean accuracies of 0.18, 0.37, 0.55,
and 0.70 at test after successive training blocks (respective
SE: .02, .03, .04, .04). Thus, although on average participants only know 3 word-object pairs after the six exposures
in block 1, by 24 exposures they have acquired over 10 pairs.
After each training block, the proportion of subjects at ceiling
on the 18AFC test was 0, .04, .11, and .28.
Mean accuracy on the primed 2AFC recognition task was
very high, 0.90 although 3 subjects had performance not significantly above chance (.554), and were thus removed from
further analysis. The median RT for the remaining trials
was 668ms (sd= 903). The 4.4% of trials with RT slower
than 1571ms were trimmed. Accuracy on the remaining trials was .94. We examined correct recognition RTs by prime
type, expecting that spurious and novel prime words, which
co-occurred rarely or never with the target object, would be
slower than matching primes, which appeared 24 times with
the target object. We further split out the matching primes
into known and unknown matches, corresponding to whether
a participant correctly chose the target object for the final
18AFC test of that word. Participants may show a speed-up
only when explicit knowledge of the match facilitates choosing the target object, or it may be that implicit knowledge
speeds their choices even for unknown matches.
We performed a linear mixed-effects regression to predict
the 2,471 correct RTs based on the prime type. Subject was
coded as a random effect, and prime type was coded as a main
effect, with known matching primes serving as the intercept.
The resulting coefficients, displayed in Table 1, show that
known matching primes resulted in faster RTs (668 ms) than
any of the other prime types, which were 54-73 ms slower.
Unknown matches were not much faster than novel or spurious primes, indicating that facilitation depends on a subject’s
explicit knowledge of the match between the prime word and
the target object.
Experiment 1 demonstrated that a short training session–24

repetitions per word-object pair–of cross-situational learning
results in facilitated primed recognition only for words that
both match the target object and were explicitly known to
match that object by the subject at the final 18AFC test. Experiment 2 investigates cross-situational learning trajectories
and priming as a function of word frequency.

Experiment 2: Varied Frequency, High
Contextual Diversity
Experiment 1 showed that cross-situational learning over a
short period–roughly 20 minutes–results in lexical priming,
a typical semantic memory effect. Experiment 2 uses a set
of training trials with varying stimulus frequency: some pairs
appeared 3 times per block, some 6 times, and some 9 times.
Word frequency is a factor that is known to vary in natural
language environments (Zipf, 1949), and to influence lexical
decision RT (Scarborough et al., 1977; Balota & Chumbley,
1984).

Participants
Participants were 50 undergraduates at Indiana University
who received course credit for participating.

Stimuli and Procedure
The stimuli and procedure used in Experiment 2 were the
same as those used in Experiment 1, except that the composition of the training trials differed. Specifically, the 18 wordobject pairs were split into three groups of six that appeared
with different frequency across training: 3 times, 6 times, or
9 times per block (12, 24, and 36 appearances across the full
training period). The pairs from these different frequency
groups (low, medium, and high, respectively) were allowed
to co-mingle randomly on trials: e.g., a trial might be composed of two high-frequency pairs, a medium frequency pair,
and a low frequency pair, or any combination of frequency
groups. That is, like Experiment 1, Experiment 2 has high
contextual diversity: any of the 18 pairs may appear with any
of the other 17 pairs. As before, four pairs were shown on
each trial, and participants were tested for knowledge of the
word meanings at the end of each block, with a final primed
2AFC recognition task.

Results and Discussion
Data from six participants were removed because their mean
performance on all four vocabulary tests was not above
chance (.056 for 18AFC). Data from the remaining 44 participants were analyzed. Figure 1 shows the mean accuracy for

each frequency group by training block. Surprisingly, lower
pair frequency does not seem to hinder performance much.
The overall mean accuracy after each training block in Experiment 2 was: .29, .50, .73, and .81, somewhat higher than
each block in Experiment 1. After each training block, the
proportion of subjects at ceiling on the 18AFC test was 0,
.07, .25, and .45, again higher than in Experiment 1.
The median RT for the primed recognition task was 689ms
(sd=843). The 6.5% of trials with RT slower than 1532ms
were trimmed. Accuracy on the remaining trials was .910.
Mean accuracy on the primed recognition task was as high as
in Experiment 1, 0.90 although 3 subjects again had performance not significantly above chance (.554), and were thus
removed from further analysis. The median RT for the remaining trials was 676ms (sd=845). The 5.8% of trials with
RT slower than 1521ms were trimmed. Accuracy on the remaining trials was 0.95.
As in Experiment 1, we examined correct recognition RTs
by prime type, expecting that spurious, novel, and unknown
matching prime words, would be slower than known matching primes. We again performed a linear mixed-effects regression to predict the 1,975 correct RTs based on prime type,
with subject as a random effect and prime type as a main effect (known matching primes as intercept). We also included
the frequency of prime-target co-occurrences across all of
training as a predictor (0 for novel primes, 0 or 8 for spu-

2467

rious, and 12, 24, or 36 for matching primes). The resulting
coefficients, displayed in Table 2, show that known matching primes resulted in significantly faster RTs (619 ms) than
novel or spurious primes (99 and 127 ms slower), but only
marginally faster than unknown matches (39 ms), unlike Experiment 1. In addition, greater prime-target co-occurrences
actually produced a small but significant slow-down (2.6 ms
per co-occurrence). These intriguing findings are explored
in-depth in a final meta-analysis across all experiments that
considers additional environmental factors.

In summary, Experiment 2 investigated whether varying word and object frequency–which vary in naturalistic
situations–would influence the priming effects found only for
matching words in Experiment 1. Not only did the priming results not change–showing no infuence of frequency–but
even the learning trajectories did not show much influence
of frequency. We suggest this may be an effect of contextual diversity: since the pairs of different frequency were allowed to appear with each other, once high frequency pairs
are known, learners can shift attention to the low frequency
pairs and bootstrap learning. Experiment 3 limits the contextual diversity of the different frequency groups to see whether
the priming results are affected.

Experiment 3: Varied Frequency, Low
Contextual Diversity – 3 Pairs/Trial
After Experiment 2 found no effect of word frequency on
priming–nor even much effect on learning, Experiment 3 uses
training trials with limited contextual diversity to determine
whether pure frequency affect priming and learning.

Participants
Participants were 70 undergraduates at Indiana University
who received course credit for participating.

Stimuli and Procedure
The stimuli and procedure used in Experiment 3 were the
same as those used in Experiments 1 and 2, except that the
composition of the training trials differed. First, only three
pairs were shown per trial, resulting in shorter 11-second trials, and there were 36 trials per block. As in Experiment 2,
there were three frequency groups: low (3 times per block),
medium (6 times), and high (9 times). However, pairs within
these groups were only allowed to appear on trials with pairs
of the same frequency: e.g., a trial will have three pairs of

either low, medium, or high frequency. Thus, a pair’s contextual diversity was limited to within frequency group (the
other 5 pairs), and will be lower than in Experiments 1 and 2.

Results and Discussion
Data from four participants were removed because their mean
performance on all four vocabulary tests was not above
chance (.056 for 18AFC). Data from the remaining 64 participants were analyzed. Figure 2 shows the mean accuracy
for each pair frequency group by training block. Unlike Experiment 2, which mixed pairs of differing frequency on the
same trials and found only a small frequency effect on performance, keeping the frequency groups separate in Experiment 3 resulted in a larger frequency effect, especially on
the low frequency group which suffered most. The overall
mean accuracy after each training block in Experiment 3 was:
.24, .49, .62, and .69, similar to Experiment 2 in the first two
blocks, but somewhat lower in the final two. After each training block, the proportion of subjects at ceiling on the 18AFC
test was 0, .03, .09, and .16; nearly a third the proportion at
ceiling in the final block of Experiment 2.
Mean accuracy on the primed recognition task was very
high, 0.94, although 3 subjects had performance not significantly above chance (.554), and were thus removed from further analysis. The median RT for the remaining trials was

2468

694ms (sd= 681). The 6.5% of trials with RT >1374ms were
trimmed. Accuracy on the remaining trials was 0.97.
As in Experiments 1 and 2, we performed a linear mixedeffects regression to predict the 3,096 correct RTs based on
prime type, with subject as a random effect and prime type
as a main effect. We again included the frequency of primetarget co-occurrences across all of training as a predictor (0
for novel primes, 0 or 8 for spurious, and 12, 24, or 36 for
matching primes). The resulting coefficients, displayed in Table 3, show that known matching primes resulted in significantly faster RTs (689 ms) than novel, spurious, or unknown
matching primes (46, 49, and 58 ms slower), in results that
qualitatively match Experiment 1’s. Moreover, prime-target
co-occurrences produced no significant effect on correct RT,
in contrast to Experiment 2–and despite apparent differences
in learning performance at different frequency. These findings are explored more in-depth in the following section.

Team, 2013). For comparison, a null model with only an intercept has AIC = 16,3672 . We fit a model with an intercept
and all five factors (frequency, CD, AE, CF, and entropy) as
main effects with no interactions. This model’s coefficients3 ,
displayed in Table 4, (AIC = 14,339), show that all factors
were significant except AE. Greater frequency and CF had the
expected positive effect on performance, but CD and entropy
had effects that may at first glance appear surprising. Lower
CD moderately increased learning, perhaps because appearing with fewer pairs results in fewer competing associations.
Yet increased entropy (i.e., uncertainty), which may serve as
an attentional cue (Kachergis et al., 2012), predicted higher
learning. Yet entropy and CD are correlated and trade off: Fitting a model without entropy yields a smaller CD effect (-.03,
p < .001), but fits slightly better (AIC = 14,371) than a model
without CD (AIC = 14,379), in which entropy is estimated to
have a significant negative effect (-.19, p < .001). The interactions cannot be explored in this space, but frequency, entropy, CF, and CD all contribute to predict cross-situational
word learning performance. Now we examine which of these
factors predict target recognition for matching primes.

Meta-analysis
Word-learning Performance
To better understand what predicts success in crosssituational learning we examined several potentially influential factors across all three experiments, measured for each
word in the training trials. We measured word frequency
(ranging from 3, 6, and 9 after block 1 up to 12, 24, and
36 after block 4) and contextual diversity (CD; number of
distinct objects a word is heard with during training, range:
4-14), which have previously been shown to influence crosssituational word learning (Kachergis et al., 2009). We also
measured age of exposure (AE; the trial at which a word first
appears, range: 1-13) and context familiarity (CF; the mean
familiarity of words heard with a given word, where familiarity is the number of prior appearances, range: 1.44-5.72),
which have been suggested to be more important than CD at
determining performance (Fazly, Ahmadi-Fakhr, Alishahi, &
Stevenson, 2010). Finally, the entropy of each word w’s possible associates (i.e., ∑o p(o, w)log(p(o, w))) was included to
measure the uncertainty (i.e., dispersion of belief) about w’s
meaning. Entropy is an important component of a recent
cross-situational learning model which assumes learners are
biased to attend to uncertain stimuli (Kachergis et al., 2012).
Using these factors to predict performance on 11,808 test
trials across training, we fit a logistic regression model using the lme4 package in R (Bates & Maechler, 2010; R Core

Semantic Knowledge
We did a mixed-effects linear regression to predict the correct
RTs for matching primes–known and unknown–according to
the same environmental training factors (AE, CD, CF, frequency, and entropy). Additionally, instead of only using the
final 18AFC’s test as a predictor for correct RT, we used the
subjects’ average accuracy (Acc.) on that word, across all
four tests. Shown in Table 5, mean accuracy, CD, and entropy
were significant predictors of correct RT for matching primes,
while CF and AE were not, and frequency was marginally
significant. Higher 18AFC accuracy sped recognition of that
object, as did greater entropy of the prime’s associates. In
contrast, higher CD or frequency produced slower RTs.

Discussion
We have presented data that suggests implicit knowledge can
develop during the course of a single cross-situational learning experiment. The differences in all three experiments are

consistent: when primed with the matching word, people are
faster to recognize the old object than when primed with either a novel word or with a spurious old word. Additionally, we measured several environmental factors–word frequency, context familiarity (CF), contextual diversity (CD),
entropy of associates, and age of exposure (AE)–at the item
level for each experiment, and performed a meta-analysis
of both the explicit learning trajectories and of the correct
primed recognition RTs for matching primes. This analysis
found that although greater frequency, CF, and entropy improve word learning, only greater entropy improves recognition RT–frequency marginally slows RT, and CF has no effect.
Increased CD harms explicit word learning, and further slows
recognition responses. Overall, we have shown that a variety
of environmental factors influence word learning in diverse
ways, and that their impact can be found not only in explicit
word learning, but also in primed recognition, which is akin
to the lexical decision task, assessing semantic knowledge.
Moreover, whereas word frequency is a metric of a single word, CD and entropy are metrics of the distribution of
the lexicon with a word. Their significance in predicting
both learning and semantic knowledge effects indicates the
importance of these distributional statistics to learning, and
suggests that people’s learning mechanisms are sensitive to
these statistics. This lends support to associative models that
noisily store many word-object co-occurrences (Kachergis et
al., 2012), in contrast to models that store single hypotheses with no contextual information (Medina et al., 2011). Indeed, without storing something of a word’s context, how can
such a system learn the rich network of the human lexicon?
A recent modeling study of naturalistic parent-child interactions showed that hybrid models which learn associations not
only between words and object but between words and other
words provide a significant learning advantage (Kievit-Kylar,
Kachergis, & Jones, 2013). We suggest that the next generation of cross-situational learning models should incorporate
such mechanisms, and look to semantic knowledge effects for
further support.
