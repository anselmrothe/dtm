Abstract
Languages tend not to exhibit unpredictable variation. We explore alignment/accommodation during interaction as a mechanism to explain this cross-linguistic tendency. Specifically,
we test the hypothesis (derived from historical linguistics) that
interactions between categorical and variable users are inherently asymmetric: while variable users (of e.g. a grammatical
marker) can accommodate to their partner by increasing their
usage, categorical users should be reluctant to accommodate to
variable partners, since this requires them to violate the rules
of their grammar. We ran an experiment in which pairs of participants learnt a miniature language (featuring a potentially
variable grammatical marker) and then used it to communicate. Our results support the hypothesis: variably-trained participants accommodate to their categorically-trained partners,
who do not change their behaviour during interaction. More
generally, interaction results in the elimination of variation: accommodation/alignment is a viable mechanism for explaining
the absence of unpredictable variation in language.

Introduction
To what extent are human behaviours a straightforward reflection of the underlying psychological characteristics of the individual? This is a key question in the cognitive sciences, and
is central to the debate in linguistics over the relationship between the typological distribution of languages and psychological constraints on language acquisition (see e.g. Chomsky, 1965; Christiansen & Chater, 2008; Evans & Levinson,
2009). Many prominent accounts assume that language universals reflect processes of language acquisition in the individual: for instance, under one account, language acquisition
involves statistical computations, and limits on the computations that human learners can carry out necessarily constrain
the form of language (e.g. Christiansen & Chater, 2008).
However, in such accounts the precise relationship between
biases in individuals and constraints on linguistic structure remains an open question. There is evidence that strong learning biases directly shape language: individual learners transform unnatural languages to conform to cross-linguistic universals (e.g. Singleton & Newport, 2004; Hudson Kam &
Newport, 2009; Culbertson, Smolensky, & Legendre, 2012).
Weaker biases, which appear ineffectual at the individual
level and which may even be hard to identify experimentally,
might also shape languages: individual learners might not appear to change unnatural input, yet change will occur due to
repeated transmission in a population of learners (see e.g. Reali & Griffiths, 2009; Smith & Wonnacott, 2010). This potentially obscures the link between language universals and

properties of individual learners: strong or absolute tendencies in language design may not reflect or require strong or
absolute constraints in learners, but may instead be a consequence of far weaker biases in language learning, amplified
as a result of the transmission of language in populations.
Much of the foregoing work (Singleton & Newport, 2004;
Hudson Kam & Newport, 2009; Reali & Griffiths, 2009;
Smith & Wonnacott, 2010) uses the learning and transmission
of unpredictable or ‘free’ variation (where competing linguistic forms alternate unpredictably) as a test case for studying
the link between language learning and language universals.
Widespread unpredictable variation is unattested in natural
languages: no two linguistic forms will occur in precisely the
same environments and perform precisely the same functions;
rather, usage is conditioned in accordance with phonological,
semantic, pragmatic or sociolinguistic criteria (Givón, 1985).
While previous work has focussed on the role of learning
and/or inter-generational transmission in eliminating unpredictable variation from language, in this paper we consider
a second mechanism by which variation might be systematically removed: alignment during interaction. Interlocutors
modify their linguistic behaviour towards that of their partners (a process known as accommodation or alignment, see
e.g. Coupland, 2010; Pickering & Garrod, 2004). These lowlevel adjustments to linguistic behaviour potentially impact
on the structure of language, both by changing the long-term
behaviour of the individuals involved, and by skewing the linguistic data from which other individuals learn.
In particular, we explore what happens during interaction between individuals who have different experiences of
the variability of a grammatical marker. Such interactions
must occur frequently as new grammatical markers develop
and spread through languages. For instance, the English
language developed from a situation where definiteness on
nouns could be marked optionally to one in which definiteness (Sommerer, 2012) and indefiniteness (Rissanen, 1967)
of noun phrase reference had to be explicitly marked (with
the articles the and a(n) as default markers). Fehér, Ritt,
Smith, and ten Wolde (2014) hypothesise that, in such scenarios, speakers with optional (in)definiteness marking would
have found it relatively easy to accommodate to speakers with
a categorical rule, simply by increasing their use of a grammatically viable option; in contrast, speakers with categorical
rules would have had to violate their grammars to accommodate to their variable partners. The prediction is therefore
that, through interaction, categorical and variable speakers

1461

would tend to converge on patterns of (in)definiteness marking that favoured the inference of obligatory and categorical rules, so that grammars which incorporated these rules
would inevitably spread at the cost of the variable type. More
generally, we seek to test the hypothesis that accommodation/alignment during interaction leads to the elimination of
unpredictable variation, with categorical patterns being inherently more resistant to change than variable usage.
In order to test these hypotheses, we ran an experiment,
completed in pairs, in which participants were asked to learn
a miniature language and then use it to communicate with
their partner. The miniature language could be used to describe scenes involving animals performing motions: scenes
differed in the animal(s) involved, the motion undertaken by
the animal(s), and the number of animals in the scene (one
or two). Pairs were assigned at random to one of three conditions, which differed in the proportion of training trials on
which singular number was signalled with an overt linguistic
marker. We were interested in how participants changed their
use of the singular marker during interaction, and in particular whether categorically-trained and variably-trained participants systematically differed in the way in which they accommodated to their partner during interaction.

Method
Participants
72 participants (53 female, mean age 21 years 10 months)
were recruited from the University of Edinburgh’s Student
and Graduate Employment service, to take part in a miniature language communication experiment. Participants were
paid £8 for their participation, and were briefed that the pair
who obtained the highest score on the communicative task
would receive an additional £20 in online shopping vouchers.

Procedure
Participants were seated in isolation in sound-proof booths.
Participants worked through a computer program which presented and tested them on a semi-artificial language, and then
allowed them to use that language to communicate remotely
with their partner. The language was text-based: participants
observed pictures and text displayed on the screen and entered their responses using the keyboard.
Language Training and Testing Procedures Participants
progressed through a three-stage training and testing regime:
1) Noun training: Participants viewed pictures of six cartoon animals (bird, elephant, frog, insect, pig, shark) along
with nonsense nouns which were intended to be memorable
and transparently related to their associated referent animal
(beeko, trunko, hoppo, bugo, oinko and fino). Each presentation lasted 3 seconds, after which the text (but not the picture) disappeared and participants were instructed to retype
that text. Participants received 4 blocks of training, each consisting of one presentation of each noun in random order.1
1 Presentation

order for the two members of a pair was ran-

2) Vocabulary testing: Participants were presented with a picture of an animal, without accompanying text, and were asked
to provide the appropriate label. Participants were tested on
each animal once, in random order.
3) Sentence training: Participants were exposed to sentences
paired with visual scenes. Scenes showed either single animals or pairs of animals (of the same type) performing one
of two possible actions, depicted graphically using arrows:
either a straight left-to-right movement, or a bouncing leftto-right movement. Sentences were presented in the same
manner as nouns (participants viewed a scene plus text, then
retyped the text). The description accompanying each scene
consisted of a nonsense verb (wooshla for straight movement,
boingla for bouncing movement), a noun (as above) and a
number marker (with the singular marker appearing variably
in some conditions, see below). Each pair of participants
was assigned two number words, one for singular and one
for plural, selected randomly without replacement from the
set {bup, dak, jeb, kem, pag, tid, wib, yav}: for instance, if
the randomly-selected markers were bup and yav, then one
bird moving straight would be labelled wooshla beeko bup
or wooshla beeko (depending on whether the singular was
marked), and two sharks bouncing would be labelled boingla
fino yav. Each of the 24 possible scenes (6 animals x 2 motions x 2 numbers) was presented six times (in six blocks,
order randomised within blocks).
4) Individual testing: Participants viewed the same 24 scenes
without accompanying text and were asked to enter the appropriate sentence. Each of the 24 scenes was presented three
times (in three blocks, order randomised within blocks).
5) Interactive testing: Participants played a director-matcher
game in which they alternated describing a scene for their
partner, and selecting a scene based on their partner’s description. When directing, participants were presented with
a scene (drawn from the set of 24 possible scenes) and
prompted to type the description so their partner could identify it. This description was then passed to their partner2 , who
had to identify the correct scene (by button-press) from an array of 8 possibilities: these 8 possibilities contained two animal types (the animal in the director’s scene plus one other
randomly-selected animal type), both motions (straight and
bounce) and both numbers (singular and plural), and thus
were guaranteed to contain the target but in themselves provide no information as to the correct target. After each trial
both participants then received feedback (either success or
failure) and an updated score (“Score so far: X out of Y”).
domised independently throughout training and individual testing.
In order to keep the participants roughly synchronised, participants
were only allowed to progress to the next block of training/testing
when their partner was also ready to begin the corresponding block.
2 In fact the closest legal description was passed to their partner,
to prevent participants communicating using English or any system
other than the language they were trained on: the string produced by
the director was checked against all 36 legal strings in the language
the participants were trained on (2 verbs x 6 nouns x three possible
markers [null, two possible markers]), and the closest legal string
(by Levenstein string-edit distance) was transferred to the matcher.

1462

Participants played 96 such communication games, organised into two blocks of 48 trials, such that each participant
directed once for each possible scene within each block (order randomised within blocks, a randomly-selected member
of the pair directing first in each block and the participants
alternating roles for the remainder of the block).
Variable marking of the singular The training language
provided post-nominal particles to mark singular and plural. The plural was consistently marked for all participants
throughout training: every sentence labelling a scene featuring two animals included the appropriate post-nominal
marker. We manipulated the extent to which participants
saw overt marking of the singular during training: participants either saw consistent categorical marking of the singular (100% marking), singular marking on two of every three
singulars (for convenience, 66% marking), with the remainder unmarked (i.e. the sentence contained only the verb and
the noun), or singular marking on one of every three singulars
(33% marking). For variably-trained participants, the training
data was constructed such that singular marking was unpredictable: every noun was marked for singular an equal number of times, and every verb appeared with a marked singular
an equal number of times.
Participants within a pair differed in the language they were
trained on. We ran 12 pairs in each of three combinations:
we will refer to the participant trained on the higher frequency of singular marking as P1 and the participant trained
on the lower frequency as P2. In the 100-66 condition, P1 is
trained on 100% (categorical) marking, P2 is trained on 66%
(variable) marking; in the 100-33 condition, P1 is trained
on categorical marking, P2 on 33% variable marking; in the
66-33 condition both are trained on variable marking (66%
and 33% respectively). These three conditions allows us to
test our specific hypothesis regarding differential accommodation by categorical- and variable-trained participants, and
also whether interaction in general leads to the reduction or
elimination of unpredictable variation in singular marking.

Results
Communicative success
Performance during the communicative portion of the task
was extremely high throughout, and varied little across conditions: the mean number of successful trials (in which the
matcher selected the picture presented to the director) was
45.04 out of 48 in the 100-66 condition (44.33 in the first
block of interaction, 45.75 in the second), 45.62 in the 10033 condition (45.33 in block 1; 45.92 in block 2), and 47.46
in the 66-33 condition (47.42 in block 1; 47.50 in block 2).

Use of the singular marker
Fig. 1 shows the full data for use of the singular marker
across training, individual testing and two blocks of interaction. Fig. 2 provides means for the various phases, plus the
mean within-pair difference in marker usage (i.e. proportion

of marked singulars produced by P1 - proportion produced by
P2; difference is inversely proportional to alignment).
In the 100-66 condition, categorically-trained participants
remain categorical throughout. Variably-trained participants
mark the singular with a range of frequencies during individual testing, approximately centred round the training
proportion (2/3); however, during interaction these participants rapidly align with their categorical partners: 11 of 12
variably-trained participants in the 100-66 condition mark the
singular in all trials during the second block of interaction,
leading to very low within-pair difference scores.
In the 100-33 condition, we see a slightly different picture: while the majority of categorically-trained participants
remain categorical throughout, some do become variable during interaction, and two participants become categorical nonusers in the second block of interaction. Variable users in the
100-33 condition exhibit a spread of responses during individual testing; during interaction, three participants accommodate upwards to become categorical, some become categorical non-users (in two cases, leading to dropping of the
marker by their partners), and several remain variable users
throughout. The level of alignment between categorical and
variable users is generally low, as can be seen in from the high
within-pair difference scores.
Finally, in the 66-33 condition we see variable responses
during individual testing, and rapid alignment during interaction, leading to low within-pair difference scores. Pairs tend
to align on either systematic use (4 pairs) or non-use (6 pairs),
with an overall preference for non-use reflected in the low
mean marking of singulars during interaction.
The statistical analyses below seek to answer three questions. Firstly, did participants probability match during individual testing, i.e. reproduce the marker frequency they were
trained on? Secondly, did participants align during interaction and if so, did they align more closely in some conditions
than others? Finally, and in relation to the specific hypothesis
outlined in the Introduction, did categorically- and variablytrained participants differ in the extent or manner in which
they accommodated to their partner? Given non-normality of
data, non-parametric statistics are used throughout.

Probability matching during individual testing
Participants were grouped according to the frequency with
which they saw the singular marked during training, yielding
three groups of 24 participants (100%, 66% or 33% marking).
The proportion of marked singulars produced during individual testing by each participant was calculated, and converted
to a difference score by subtracting this proportion from the
proportion the participant was trained on (see Fig. 3a). Participants trained on 100% marking reliably marked all singulars during individual testing, in accordance with their
training data. 66%-trained participants produced a distribution of marker usage statistically indistinguishable from
probability matching (assessed by one-sample test, V=139,
p=.988); however, 33%-trained participants under-produce
marked singulars (V=68.5, p=.035). While this suggests that

low-frequency variable markers might be more prone to elimination than high-frequency markers, the direct comparison
between the difference scores from the 66% and 33% conditions yields no significant difference (W=366, p=.109), suggesting that caution is required in this interpretation.

Alignment during interaction
We use the within-pair difference scores provided in Fig. 2
as our measure of alignment, low difference scores indicating
high alignment. Taking each condition separately and comparing difference scores at individual testing (i.e. before interaction) to those in the second block of interaction, differences
significantly reduce (i.e. participants align to a statistically
significant extent due to interaction) in all conditions (100-66:
V=44, p=.013; 66-33: V=69, p=.016; 100-33: V=33, p=.04;
all comparisons remain significant after Holm correction for
multiple comparisons). Looking across conditions, the three
conditions differ in their levels of alignment at individual
testing (Kruskall-Wallis χ2 =16.692, p<.001) and in the second block of interaction (Kruskall-Wallis χ2 =7.482, p=.024).
These differences are driven by significant differences between the 100-33 condition and the other conditions (10066 against 100-33 at individual testing: W=9, p<.001; 66-33
against 100-33 at individual testing: W = 129.5, p<.001; 10066 against 100-33 at interactive testing: W = 38, p = .025; 6633 against 100-33 at interactive testing: W = 104, p = .041).
This accords with the impression from Figs. 1 and 2 that there
is less alignment in the 100-33 condition, possibly due to the
larger difference in frequency of marked singulars in training.

Accommodation
Accommodation is characterised, in this experiment, by systematically changing from one’s personal estimate of the frequency of singular marking during training (as evidenced during individual testing) towards the frequency used by one’s
partner. We quantify this by calculating, for each participant, the difference between the proportion of marked singulars produced during individual testing and the proportion
produced during the second block of interaction (subtracting
the former from the latter: positive change indicates increased
marker use). These values are shown in Fig. 3b. The hypothesis outlined in the Introduction is that categorically-trained
participants will not accommodate downwards to variabletrained participants, but that variable-trained participants will
accommodate upwards to categorically-trained participants.
A statistical analysis supports this hypothesis, most
strongly in the 100-66 condition. Collapsing across the
100-66 and 100-33 conditions, variably-trained participants
change significantly more than categorically-trained participants (W = 159, p = .003); furthermore, this is a reliable
increase in marker usage (change significantly greater than
0, V=126.5, p=.003). Comparison with the 66-33 condition
shows that it is not the case that variably-trained participants
tend to increase their marker usage (collapsing across all participants in the 66-33 condition, change in marker usage between individual testing and interaction is not significantly

different from 0, V=103, p=.294), nor do participants who
are paired with a partner who was trained on a higher frequency of marker usage automatically increase their usage
(considering only the 33%-trained individuals from the 6633 condition, change not significantly different from 0, V=30,
p=.824). A three-way comparison of P2s across all three conditions reveals a difference in amount of change (KruskalWallis χ2 = 8.586, p=.014); post-hoc tests show that the difference between P2s in the 100-66 and 100-33 conditions is
not statistically significant (W = 92, p=.251), whereas the
other contrasts are at least marginally significant (P2s in 10066 vs P2s in 66-33: W = 107.5, p=.043; P2s in 100-33 vs
P2s in 66-33: W = 105.5, p=.054). Finally, while the lowerfrequency-trained P2 participants in the 100-66 and 100-33
conditions do not change by different amounts according
to this comparison, and collectively they increase their frequency of marking, this effect seems smaller in the 100-33
condition: testing the two groups separately, P2s in the 10066 condition change by an amount significantly greater than
0 (V = 44, p=.013), whereas P2s in the 100-33 condition do
not (V = 23, p=.15). Again, this suggests that the large difference in training frequencies in the 100-33 condition modulates the tendency for variably-trained participants to accommodate upwards to their categorically-trained partners.

Discussion
Our experiment provides support for both our specific hypothesis that accommodation between categorically- and
variably-trained participants is asymmetric (variably-trained
participants tend to accommodate upwards to their partners,
while categorically-trained participants tend not to accommodate downwards) and that, more generally, alignment during
interaction leads to the loss of linguistic variation (there is
a striking loss of variable marker usage even in the 66-33
condition, where both participants were trained on variable
systems). Additionally, our data suggests that the extent to
which participants accommodate may be modulated by the
extent to which they differ linguistically: while participants
in the 100-33 condition do align somewhat through interaction, the level of alignment is far less than in the 100-66 and
66-33 conditions, where participants are trained on more similar languages. A useful avenue for future work would be to
identify the critical distance threshold for alignment.
A number of other questions remain to be addressed.
Firstly, we have only considered presence/absence variation:
other paradigms (Hudson Kam & Newport, 2009; Smith &
Wonnacott, 2010) look at variation where there are two or
more overt markers for a single function, and it may be
that alignment during interaction proceeds differently in such
cases. Secondly, we look only at alignment within pairs who
undergo a relatively short period of training and a relatively
long, intense period of interaction with a single partner: since
the real-world case involves longer learning (perhaps entailing greater commitment to the trained system) and interaction with a wider range of partners, this seems like a worth-

while scenario to explore experimentally. Finally, accommodation is surprisingly rapid in our study, with a great deal of
alignment taking place in the first few trials of interaction: it
would be intriguing to investigate the lower-level processes
by which participants make judgements about how to use
marking on the basis of one or two exposures to the marking
behaviour of their partner, and how these might be influenced
by modifying a participant’s knowledge of the language used
by their partner (e.g. by manipulating whether participants
were trained entirely in isolation, as here, or together).

Conclusions
Alignment during interaction leads to the elimination of unpredictable variation, and consequently provides a second
(complimentary) mechanism by which the absence of unpredictable variation in natural language might be explained.
Furthermore, as suggested by the historical literature, accommodation during interaction is inherently asymmetric: while
variable users can accommodate to their partner by increasing
their frequency of usage, categorical users tend not to accommodate to their variable partners by becoming variable. As
such, once a grammatical marker reaches a critical threshold in a population such that many individuals are variable
and some are categorical, alignment during interaction should
drive the population towards uniform categorical marker use.
