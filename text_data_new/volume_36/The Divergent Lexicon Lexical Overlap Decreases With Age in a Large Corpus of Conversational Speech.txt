Abstract

that allows older adults to effectively deal with a computational challenge of increasing complexity. Consistent with
a meta-analysis suggesting older adult have larger vocabularies than younger ones (Verhaeghen, 2003), Ramscar et al.
demonstrate that tests of vocabulary in older adults may underrepresent the size of speakers’ lexicons because they reach
ceiling levels of performance at relatively early ages. Such
tasks, they argue, have concealed lifelong increases in vocabulary size; consequently, while researchers have emphasized
the slowing of language processing and production, they have
overlooked the all-important caveat that older adults demonstrate a mastery over a considerably larger amount of linguistic information.

Changes in language processing and production accompanying aging have most commonly been interpreted as evidence
for age-related cognitive decline. A recent proposal (Ramscar et al., 2014) challenges that interpretation, asserting instead that such changes emerge as a consequence of—and in
order to support—processes of lifelong learning like continued vocabulary growth. Under this account, the mechanisms
of language processing and production do not deteriorate with
age, but rather the computational complexity of the underlying
information processing task increases as more data is observed
over the lifespan. The current study examines whether spoken language displays properties consistent with the notion of
lifelong learning by examining the relationship between age,
within-speaker lexical diversity, and between-speaker lexical
overlap in a conversational speech corpus, Switchboard I. We
find older speakers exhibit more diverse lexicons, and that they
share fewer words with interlocutors than younger speakers.
Keywords: lexicon; aging; corpus linguistics; speech

Introduction
Age heralds, at least on first glance, a decline in speakers’
language abilities: older adults are slower to recognize words
(Spieler & Balota, 2000), experience more tip-of-the-tongue
states in which they cannot produce the correct word (Brown
& Nix, 1996), have a higher rate of disfluencies in conversational speech than their younger counterparts (Horton et al.,
2010), and perceive a decline in their own language abilities
(Ryan et al., 1992). Many of these declines implicate changes
in processing and production related specifically to words, necessitating a theory of how lexical processing and production
may change as speakers age.
Established theories that account for slowing in lexical processing, as described in Thornton & Light (2006), include
the inhibition deficit hypothesis, that older adults are less
able to focus on relevant information (Hasher et al., 1997),
and the transmission density hypothesis, that weakened connections in memory result in slower retrieval (Burke et al.,
1991). However, an alternative overarching hypothesis is that
observed decreases in performance in lexical processing and
production are a natural consequence of the increasing difficulty of the information processing problem of recognizing
and retrieving an ever-greater number of entities (spoken or
written words, or recognizing objects themselves) as an individual ages (Ramscar et al., 2014). Decreases in observed
performance may be mediated by an increased number of
competitors or an increase in the size of the search space;
under this view, the decrease in observed performance is not
interpreted as an age-related pathology, but rather a trade-off

The reading simulations in Ramscar et al. (2014) yield two
predictions regarding conversational speech. First, if older
adults have larger productive vocabularies as a consequence
of lifelong vocabulary growth, we should expect their speech
to be more lexically diverse than that of younger speakers. Second, as speakers’ vocabularies grow upon exposure
to highly diverse inputs, fewer vocabulary items should be
shared shared across speakers. While both predictions seem
intuitive, a small speech sample containing an extremely limited subset of a speaker’s vocabulary may not reveal an appreciable distinction in word choice. Likewise it remains an
open question as to whether age-related divergence in lexicons, if empirically observable at all, manifests in brief samples of conversational speech. Nonetheless, precisely these
brief conversational interactions make up a substantial part of
language use. The properties of these speech samples may
diverge significantly from the texts used in the reading simulations of Ramscar et al.; the sampling process in the model
may also differ in important ways from real speakers. The
current paper thus explores how within-speaker lexical diversity (how many different words are used by a speaker) and
between-speaker lexical overlap (how many words are used
by both speakers) varies in conversational speech as a function of age when gender, level of education, dialect, and topic
of conversation are controlled.
On a most basic level, lexical diversity can be thought of as
the number of distinct word types present in a speech sample.
However, any index of diversity must be robust to sample size
confounds because a larger speech sample (containing more
tokens, or discrete, realized instances of types) is likely to
contain more types than a smaller one. Measures of lexical
diversity seeking to overcome this problem have been devel-

oped for a variety of research areas, including first language
acquisition (Durán et al., 2004), speech pathology (Watkins
et al., 1995), and language teaching (Malvern & Richards,
2002). As for measures capturing the effects of aging on lexical diversity in neurotypical adults, Horton et al. (2010) found
that the Uber index, a measure of lexical diversity generally
robust to sample size variation, increased with speaker age in
the Switchboard corpus. As a supporting analysis for their examination of age-related changes in conversational speaking
rate, their published analysis did not control for contributions
of other demographic characteristics to lexical diversity.
A theoretically related, but potentially independent, measurement of the lexical properties of a conversational speech
sample is the degree to which speakers use the same lexical types as one another in a conversation. While seemingly
intuitive that the number of shared types would decrease as
within-speaker lexical diversity increases (Table 1, case 1 →
2), it is not a forgone conclusion. Speakers could, alternatively, draw from similar sets of additional types as their lexical diversity increases (Table 1, case 1 → 3). The current
work investigates how lexical overlap changes as a function
of lexical diversity. In addition to the problem of sample size
already encountered in assessing lexical diversity, measuring
the similarity of an individual subject’s word choice to that
of an interlocutor depends crucially on properties of both the
speaker and the interlocutor’s speech. For this reason, properties of conversational dyads, such as the ages or levels of
education of both speakers, are investigated as predictors of
the proportion of shared lexical types in conversations.
The principle objectives of the current paper are thus threefold: first, to replicate the finding of an age-related increase
in lexical diversity found by Horton et al. (2010) after better
controlling for other demographic factors that might influence
lexical diversity; second to examine how the pattern of lexical diversity relates to the proportion shared lexical types between speakers; third, to assess whether predictions derived
from reading simulations in Ramscar et al. (2014) are supported by the observed properties of conversational speech.

Data
The Switchboard I Corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992) contains
the transcribed contents of 2,866 telephone conversations between 543 speakers, aged 17 to 68, collected in the late
1980’s. Participants were randomly assigned conversational

partners on the basis of shared interest in any of 70 speech
topics. Conversations averaged 6 minutes, though many continued for longer periods. Participants were free to leave the
assigned topic. Many speakers participated in several conversations with various interlocutors in the corpus. Conversations were transcribed into a standardized format by court
stenographers.

Methods
The publicly-available aligned Switchboard I corpus was
downloaded from http://www.isip.piconepress.com/
projects/switchboard/. All word-level annotations were
extracted to a single table and associated with corresponding speaker-level and conversation-level metadata. Ages were
calculated from birth years and the reference year of collection, 1988. Approximately one million tokens containing
bracketed markup (including 917,000 [silence] tokens) were
excluded from further analyses. All token strings were converted to lowercase.
All function words, including determiners, quantifiers, pronouns, conjunctions, interjections, and auxiliary verbs, as
well as all contractions, salutations, and discourse particles (affirmatives, negatives, and non-lexical particles like
“um-hum”) were excluded using a wordlist. This procedure yielded 1.17 million tokens across 4,862 speakerconversation pairs, the distribution of which is shown in Figure 1.
The Uber index of lexical diversity (Dugast, 1980; see also
Jarvis, 2002) was calculated for each speaker in each conversation:

U(Tokens, Types) =

log(Tokens)2
log(Tokens) − log(Types)

(1)

Tweedie & Baayen (1998) warn of residual sample size effects in the Uber index, thus MTLD (McCarthy & Jarvis,
2010) and Yule’s I (the inverse of Yule’s K, Yule 1944)
were also calculated. Given the relatively equal sample sizes
from speakers in Switchboard, and a high correlation between
these metrics—Pearson’s r = .81 and r = .79 with the Uber
Index, respectively—the current work follows Horton et al.
(2010) in reporting the Uber index.
Following the calculation of lexical diversity, a subsampling procedure was used to ensure matched sample sizes in

Table 1: This toy example demonstrates how an increase in lexical diversity (Uber Index) may co-occur with either a decrease
in lexical overlap between speakers (Case 1→ Case 2) or an increase in lexical overlap (Case 1 → Case 3). Individual letters
represent tokens; types are grouped by color. The Jaccard index, a measure of similarity between speakers, is calculated as the
number of types in the intersection between speakers divided by the number of types in the union.

the comparison of speakers’ type inventories. To permit comparison across conversations as well as within, all conversations above a fixed token count were repeatedly subsampled
to a fixed token count before calculating overlap metrics, similar to the methodology described in Pine et al. (2013). A
sample of 157 tokens was chosen in that it maximizes the total
number of tokens analyzed (acceptable conversations × sample size). This yielded 1385 conversations out of the 2431 that
survived function word exclusion (Figure 1). The distribution
over ages of participants in the filtered set of conversations is
shown in Figure 2. Subsampling to a fixed token count reflects a trade-off between completeness in sampling individual conversations and completeness in sampling the entire set
of conversations: while a higher token threshold allows sampling more tokens from some of the individual conversations,
fewer total conversations would have the requisite number of
tokens for both speakers for inclusion in the analysis.
The Jaccard index, a set theoretic overlap measurement
from early work in mathematical ecology (Jaccard, 1912),
provides a conversation-level metric of the proportion of
types appearing in the lexical inventories of both speakers out
of the total number that appeared in either. If A and B are sets
of lexical types, the Jaccard index is calculated as the cardinality of the set intersection divided by the cardinality of the
set union:

Figure 2: The smoothed joint distribution over ages of
younger and older participants in conversations in Switchboard I meeting the sample size requirements for the calculation of lexical overlap. While most conversations occur
between a younger speaker between 20 and 30 and an older
speaker between 25 and 50, the corpus has appreciable coverage across speaker ages. Measurements are collapsed across
the line of symmetry because a conversation between a 32 and
a 48 year old speaker is identical to a conversation between a
48 and a 32 year old speaker.
closer to Speaker B than vice versa.
For each conversation, we ran 100 independent simulations consisting of drawing 157 tokens with replacement from
each speaker and calculating the Jaccard index. The reported
Jaccard index was calculated by taking the mean value from
these 100 runs.
The above data transformations and measurement procedures produce a dataset with measures of lexical diversity,
the number of shared types in a size-controlled sample, and
demographic properties for each speaker in each conversation. Given the dependence of observable behaviors in
Switchboard on inherently dyadic communicative processes,
we take special care to include demographic properties of
the interlocutor along with those of speakers as predictors in
our mixed effects models. By explicitly treating interlocutor
properties as predictors, we can account for contributions of
interlocutors to observed speaker behaviors.

Age of Speaker

Figure 3: Left: the Uber index of lexical diversity as a function of speaker age. This measure of lexical diversity reveals that
older adults use a more varied vocabulary than younger adults. Right: Fewer words used by older speakers are used by their
interlocutors. The black line corresponds to the ordinary least squares regression using the single variable depicted. Age values
are jittered in the range (+.5,-.5) to minimize overplotting.

Proportion of Shared Types

are also used by his or her interlocutor, a possible but nonobligate correlate of the increase in lexical diversity (see Introduction), decreases with age (Figure 3, right).

We constructed a mixed effects linear regression model in
which a speaker’s lexical diversity, as measured by centered
Uber index, was predicted from demographic properties of
both the speaker and the interlocutor (age, gender, level of
education, and dialect) and the interactions between these
properties (Speaker Age × Interlocutor Age, Speaker Dialect
× Speaker Dialect, etc.) as fixed effects. Conversational
topic was treated as a random intercept. This initial model
was pruned by comparing the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) of the full model against versions of the model with
each predictor omitted in turn. Through this procedure, all interaction terms as well as Interlocutor Dialect and Interlocutor Level of Education were removed; the resulting model is
displayed in Table 2. Speaker age has a small positive β coefficient, but is highly reliable. Men tend to exhibit more diverse vocabularies than women in these brief conversations.
Lexical diversity increases with speaker level of education,
and diversity varies as a function of speaker dialect, though
both predictors have high standard error. Interestingly, lexical diversity exhibited by a speaker is dependent on some demographic properties of their interlocutor, possibly because
speakers increase or decrease their lexical diversity to match
interlocutors in a form of accommodation. Alternatively, interlocutors may directly influence the properties of discourse;
for example, an interlocutor may govern the rate at which the
conversational dyad moves into new material.

While age is not a strong predictor of shared lexical types in
the absence of additional controls (Figure 4, left), conversations between speakers with high lexical diversity result in a
smaller proportion of shared lexical types (Figure 4, right).
This decrease in overlap with an increase in lexical diversity
suggests speakers do not draw from the same set of types
when they exhibit more diverse vocabularies within conversations. Similarly-aged speaker are no more likely to share
types (a similarity benefit would manifest as higher values on
the diagonal of Figure 4, left).
A linear mixed effects regression model predicting the proportion of shared lexical items (Jaccard’s index) per conversation was constructed with topic as a random intercept and
cumulative age of the dyad, the difference in age of the speakers, male-male, female-female, or mixed speakers, same vs.
different dialect speakers, cumulative education, and difference in education, as fixed effects. Conversations with one or
more speakers with Unknown education levels (n=40) were
excluded from the analysis, while the remaining levels were
treated as a scalar in the range 0-3. Stepwise model pruning on the basis of BIC supported the exclusion of difference terms and dialectal properties of speakers from the final model (Table 3). Older dyads exhibited marginally higher
proportions of shared types than younger ones. Male and female dyads exhibit fewer shared types than female-female
dyads; male-male dyads exhibit even lower type overlap.
Higher levels of education were predictive of a lower Jaccard
index.
To further leverage information from the bootstrap, we also
constructed a set of 1,000 linear mixed effects models, each
predicting one set of sampled proportion of shared types. The

Limitations And Future Work
The lexical inventory of a speaker in a brief telephone conversation is necessarily modulated by the particular communicative needs of that conversation. While the current work
suggests that properties of speaker identity have a detectable
effect on lexical diversity despite the brevity of conversations
and discourse-specific effects, corpora with longer interactions between speakers and more conversations per speaker
could allow for better decoupling of speaker-specific effects
from discourse-specific effects.
The current work excluded function words from the analysis because of extremely high levels of overlap between subjects. “A,” “I,” and, “the,” for example, were used by virtually
every speaker in the sample. However, the blanket exclusion
of function word, including relatively low frequency function
words like “although” and “moreover,” removes a potentially
interesting source of lexical variability between speakers and
age groups. Given previous work on gendered differences in

Intercept

Male - Male Dyad
Cumulative Education

the use of function words (Newman et al., 2008), we might
expect even greater gender-based effects in lexical overlap
than those observed here.
Another shortcoming of the current method is that it treats
each conversation as a single temporal point, and neglects
variability within the timecourse of the conversation. No
strong conclusions may be drawn regarding processes of
lexical accommodation, wherein speakers display increasing or decreasing levels of similarity in lexical choice over
the course of the conversation. Comparison of size-matched
temporal subsets would further reduce the number of analyzable tokens; as such new metrics for calculating between
speaker lexical overlap may be required to elucidate withinconversation dynamics.

Conclusion
The current work leaves us with a consistent picture of lexical
diversity and overlap in conversational speech. A speaker’s
lexical diversity is conditioned on the properties of his or her
interlocutor, but age and higher levels of education predict
increased lexical diversity for individual speakers. Withinspeaker type inventories that are more diverse result in fewer

Figure 4: Left: proportion of lexical types shared between speakers in a conversation as a function of the average number of
types in samples of a fixed token size. Conversations between speakers with more diverse (within-speaker) lexical inventories
exhibit lower proportion of shared lexical types within a conversation. Right: the same metric of shared lexical types in a
conversation as a function of age of speakers. Each pixel represents a mean of observed values in that domain.
shared lexical items in conversations. Consistent with predictions derived from Ramscar et al. (2014) regarding lifelong
learning, older speakers use more word types than younger
speakers, and their particular selection of words is more likely
to diverge with other older speakers. That such patterns are
identifiable even in brief samples of conversational speech
suggests that lifelong changes in language production may be
implicated even in short episodes of everyday language use.
