Abstract
Eye movement recording is not only a research tool but can
also be used as a learning tool. Previous research on eye
movement modeling and analogical thinking has
demonstrated that stimulating eye movements can foster
learning and problem solving. Such training interventions can
support learners and problem solvers without revealing the
solution, but just by guiding their gaze. The present two
studies investigated whether a preceding stimulation of eye
movements would affect the comprehension of following
learning materials. Study I revealed a positive effect of a nonverbal eye movement pre-training on learning outcomes.
Study II corroborated this finding and, additionally, revealed
no effect of presentation format (static versus dynamic) on
comprehension. With respect to eye movements performed
during the learning phase, pre-training led to more
homogenous fixation strings. Moreover, the homogeneity
could also be attributed to a dynamic representation (Study
II). In sum, a non-verbal pre-training of eye movements
before exposure to the learning content fosters comprehension
in static and in dynamic representations.

Keywords: eye movement modeling; pre-training; eye
tracking; knowledge acquisition; static versus dynamic.

Eye Movement Modeling: Seeing From an
Expert’s Angle
Experts and novices not only differ on performance as a
result of their actions, but also on processes that lead to their
outcomes. New methods on the field of eye movement
research enable access to experts’ eye movements during
decision making or problem solving. The meta-analysis by
Gegenfurtner, Lehtinen, and Säljö (2011) clearly revealed
systematic eye movement differences between experts and
novices. Based on these results, it has been suggested that
expertise can be acquired faster by training novices in visual
attention allocation: “a replay of the eye movements of
experts, superimposed on the screen showing the
visualization, can be used to model the eye movements of
novices” (Gegenfurtner et al., 2011, p. 542).
Such eye movement modeling examples (EMME) can be
considered as worked-out examples (Jarodzka et al., 2012).
In EMMEs the replay of an expert’s eye movements gives
an example on where to look when performing a task.
EMMEs consist of the visualization of a model’s eye
movements on a visual stimulus—providing the basis for
information processes—and verbal explanations of the

model. However, a verbalization of the processes is not
necessary to make eye modeling successful. In an
experiment on problem solving, Grant and Spivey (2003)
identified characteristic eye movements of successful
problem solvers (i.e., many saccades crossing task-relevant
areas). In a second stage—testing the reversed effect—the
looking behavior of successful solvers was used to develop
cues for participants who were unfamiliar to the problem.
These cues (short flashes) were meant to attract attention
and thus trigger the ‘right’ eye movements. The cues were
implemented in the learning materials and presented to
uninformed participants. Participants who were exposed to
these cues outperformed participants who learned with
noncritical cues. Inspired by these results, Thomas and
Lleras (2007) made an attempt to facilitate successful
problem solving by making their participants “move their
eyes in a pattern that embodied the problem’s solution” (p.
664). Comparing several conditions, the authors not only
replicated the results by Grant and Spivey (2003), but also
came to the conclusion that there is a relationship between
eye movements and spatial cognition: the closer the
similarity between the real eye movements and cues, the
better the solution rate.
Recently, the approach of training eye movements was
adopted in the context of acquiring skills in medical
diagnosis (Jarodzka et al., 2010). The acquisition of such
skills in medicine requires efficient search, detection, and
interpretation of task-relevant features. The authors tested
two versions of modeling examples: one version showed the
expert’s eye movements as a circle; a second version
showed expert’s eye movements as a clear spotlight whereas
the rest was blurred. A first study demonstrated that the
participants in the spotlight condition outperformed the
circle condition and the control condition (without cue) in
diagnosing seizures (Jarodzka et al., 2010).
In a follow-up study, the participants' eye movements
were analyzed (Jarodzka et al., 2012). Again, participants in
the spotlight condition performed best on making medical
diagnoses. The superiority of the spotlight condition was
also reflected in the eye movement data: modeling eye
movements by spotlights guided attention more and helped
them identify relevant information at an earlier stage as well
as fixate task-relevant information for a longer time. These
results were extended to teaching interpretation of computer
tomography scans (Seppänen & Gegenfurtner, 2012).

Participants who watched a video replaying an expert’s eye
movements and interpretations of such a scan improved in
diagnosing.
The results from research on EMME are promising.
Despite different realizations of the model’s eye movements
in the to-be-inspected visual stimulus, all aforementioned
studies implemented the model’s eye movement directly in
the material. Results from a study on analogical problem
solving, however, show that cues and learning material can
be separated and presented chronologically (Pedone,
Hummel, & Holyoak, 2001). Before solving a problem,
participants were confronted with different diagrams
demonstrating convergent (similar to solution) and
divergent (dissimilar to solution) arrows. Four experiments
demonstrated that convergent diagrams which are similar
and analogue to the solution supported problem solving
best. Especially dynamic (i.e. animated) analogues
encouraged participants to encode the information in the
initial diagram as motion and, thus, fostered spontaneous
retrieval, noticing, and, above all, relational encoding. The
authors conclude that “dynamic displays result in encodings
that are more closely connected to the perceptual system
than can be readily achieved by purely verbal materials”
(Pedone et al., 2001, p. 220). However, it is not clear
whether the arrows in the diagrams fostered problem
solving because of the similarity to the solution or because
of the eye movements that were triggered by the arrows.

Method
Sample and design
Participants were 44 university students (33 freshmen; 9
male; age M = 22.12, SD = 3.14) who were randomly
assigned to an experimental group with eye movement pretraining prior to the learning phase (pre-training group) or a
control group without any training (no-training group).
Participants were tested in individual sessions of
approximately 60 minutes.
Materials
Learning material The learning environment consisted of a
static picture illustrating a solar power plant which converts
solar radiation into electricity (Figure 1). After a short
introduction, the cycles of the system and their
interdependencies were explained by a narration presented
via headphones. Each cycle can be considered as a specific
subsystem with its own structures and a certain flow
direction of liquids in the pipes of the system. The
components of the system served specific functions.

Study I: Pre-Training and Static
Representation
In Study I we raised the question as to whether learning can
be fostered even when eye movement modeling and the
visual complex learning material are presented separately.
More specifically, participants had to undergo a non-verbal
and content-free pre-training where they had to follow a
circle moving on a white screen not revealing any contents.
The circle moved analogue to the processes that were
presented afterwards in a static display (Figure 1). We
assumed that participants who were first exposed to the eye
movement pre-training and then to the learning material
should benefit from such pre-training.
We compared two groups: a group with analogue eye
movement training (pre-training group) and a group without
such pre-training (no-training group). We addressed the
following hypotheses: We expected the pre-training group
to outperform the no-training group on learning outcomes
(H1). This superiority should be also reflected on the
subscales assessing different knowledge types of technical
systems (Kalyuga & Hanham, 2011), i.e., knowledge about
structures, processes, and functions (H2). In a second step,
we analyzed the eye movement data to see how the pretraining would impact the eye movement behavior when
processing the learning environment. We expected the pretraining group to perform more saccades in the direction
promoted by the pre-training (H3). In addition, the fixation
strings within the pre-training group were expected to be
more similar compared with the no-pre-training group (H4).

Figure 1: Learning environment (solar power plant).
Pre-training The eye movement pre-training in the
experimental condition consisted of an animated single
black circle (0.3 cm in diameter) moving analogue to the
pipes of the technical device which was presented in the
learning phase afterwards. Direction and order of the
circle’s movements were also congruent to the narration
which accompanied the learning material. During pretraining, the background of the screen was white and no
details of the actual learning environment were presented to
the learner (Figure 2).
Prior knowledge To assess prior knowledge, we developed
a test consisting of questions on the domain-specific content
of the learning material (solar power plant). A maximum
score of 36 could be achieved. The very low scores on prior
knowledge indicate that the participants were novice in this
area (Table 1). We also asked for the last grade in physics (1
= very good, 6 = fail).
Learning outcomes To assess learning outcomes, we
developed a test based on the functions-processes-structures
framework (Kalyuga & Hanham, 2011). Structures are the
components a technical device consists of, processes are the
operations within a device, functions refer to the purpose a
device and its sub-components were designed for. Hence,
our test comprised three subscales: Knowledge of structures

1444

(15 items, ICC = .978), knowledge of processes (15 items,
ICC = .921), and knowledge of functions (10 items, ICC =
.920).

Procedure
First, participants answered a questionnaire on
demographics and worked on a test assessing prior
knowledge. Participants were then randomly assigned to
either a condition with pre-training or a condition without
pre-training. The pre-training group was instructed to follow
a black circle on a content-free screen prior to the learning
environment; the control group skipped this part and
immediately began with the learning environment. Finally,
learning outcomes were assessed by a posttest.

Results
Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for all
variables reported. Before testing our hypotheses, we
checked if prior knowledge was a potential covariate. Last
grade in physics, r = -.643, p < .001, and the pretest
performance, r = .304, p = .045, were positively correlated
to the learning outcomes. Prior knowledge and grade were
not correlated, r = -.248, p = .105. In addition, groups did
not differ on pretest, t(42) = -0.414, p = .681, d = -0.12, nor
on grade in physics, t(42) = -0.780, p = .440, d = -0.21. We,
therefore, included both variables as covariates to test our
hypotheses on learning outcomes (analysis of covariance).

pre-training with dashed lines representing the movement of
the black circle and an arrow indicating the direction of the
movement. Dashed lines and arrow were not visible to the
learner during the pre-training. Illustration of analysis of
saccades in the lower part: Within a semantic AOI (grey
area) all saccades in the predefined direction, from right to
left in example, represented by vectors within a 90° angle
were counted to analyze congruent saccades.
Apparatus
Gaze data were recorded by a SensoMotoric Instruments
Remote Eye-tracking Device and iView X 2.7 (120Hz,
angular error < .5). The stimulus was presented via
ExperimentCenter 3.0 (22'' monitor, display resolution of
1680x1050, set 60 to 80 cm in front of the participant). A
fixation was defined as an event that lasted for at least 80
milliseconds with a maximum dispersion value of 100
pixels. In sum, we defined nine semantic areas of interest
(AOIs) containing learning relevant information.
We analyzed the number of saccades accomplished
congruent to the pre-training to capture smooth pursuit. For
this purpose, vectors between each two fixations were
recorded and aggregated. With respect to the directions in
the pre-training, we counted only saccades with the correct
direction, that means, saccades characterized by the same
direction that was induced by the pre-training and the
movement of the fluids in the pipes. Figure 2 illustrates one
exemplary semantic AOI within which all saccades within a
90° angle were summed up.
The Levenshtein distance is the minimum of insertions,
deletions, and substitutions of operations to transform one
string into another string (Levenshtein, 1966). Each
participant produced a string defined by the chronological
order of AOIs he or she looked at. First, we calculated the
pairwise distances within groups between each participant
and its other group members in a matrix. We calculated the
mean of all distances from one participant to each of his/her
group members. A low Levenshtein distance means that few
operations are necessary to transfer one string into another
string, and thus, both strings are rather similar. High
Levenshtein distances represent dissimilar strings.

Testing the hypothesis whether the pre-training would
result in better performance (H1), we found a positive effect
of pre-training on the learning outcomes, F(1, 40) = 4.788, p
= .035, ηp2 = .107, indicating that the pre-training group
outperformed the no-training group. Next, we analyzed
whether this finding holds for the subscales (H2). There was
no effect of pre-training on knowledge about structures, F(1,
40) = 0.648, p = .426, ηp2 = .016. There was, however, a
significant effect of pre-training on knowledge about
processes, F(1, 40) = 6.747, p = .013, ηp2 = .144, as well as
about functions, F(1, 40) = 4.326, p = .044, ηp2 = .098, with
the pre-training group outperforming the no-training group.
Next, we analyzed the eye movements performed during the
presentation of the learning environment. A t-test revealed a
non-significant effect of pre-training on the saccades
performed within the areas of interest (H3), t(41) = -0.678,
p = .502, d = -0.21. We used the Levenshtein distance to test
our last hypothesis, whether the pre-training group would
lead to more homogeneous eye movements (H4). Although

1445

the distance was lower in the pre-training group, indicating
more homogenous strings, there was a non-significant effect
of pre-training, t(41) = 1.442, p = .157, d = 0.45.

Method

Discussion
In study I we raised the question whether a non-verbal, eye
movement-based pre-training could foster comprehension of
a static learning environment. Consistent with our
expectations the pre-training group outperformed the notraining group. This superiority could be especially ascribed
to knowledge about functions (moderate effect size) and
processes (large effect size). Contrary to our expectations,
the eye movement based pre-training did not result in more
congruent saccades on the learning content. Moreover, the
pre-training did not significantly affect homogeneity of
strings. In sum, an eye-movement pre-training positively
affected knowledge acquisition from a static learning
environment and thus can be considered a successful
instructional design intervention.

Study II: Combining Pre-Training and
Presentation Format
Following up these promising findings we raised the
question how the pre-training would affect comprehension
of a dynamic learning environment. Study II investigated
whether the pre-training might become obsolete when the
learning content was dynamic and, by its nature, contained
movements which guided the learner’s visual attention.
Alternatively, combining pre-training and a dynamic
representation could also result in an additive effect. We
extended the design of Study I by varying the presentation
format (static versus dynamic). According to the finding in
Study I, we expected a main effect of pre-training (H1a).
Based on results from a meta-analysis on animations
according to which dynamic representations can have
beneficial effects on learning (Höffler & Leutner, 2007), we
expected a main effect of presentation format on learning
outcomes (H1b): A dynamic representation should foster
learning. The same pattern, namely main effect of pretraining and main effect of dynamic format, should apply to
the subscales of the learning outcomes—assessed by
structures, processes, and functions (H2a-H2b). With
respect to saccades on relevant areas in the learning
environment, we expected a main effect of pre-training
(H3a) and a main effect of presentation format for the
benefit of a dynamic representation (H3b). Similar to
expectations in Study I, we expected the pre-training groups
to show more homogeneous eye movements (H4a). We also
expected a main effect of presentation format (H4b).
Moreover, we also checked the interaction effect between
training and presentation format asking whether combining
pre-training with a dynamic representation could have
further effects on learning outcomes and eye movements
(H1-4c). So far, we had no expectations in how far a
training*presentation interaction would have an effect on
our dependent variables of interest.

Sample and Design
Participants were 99 University students (59 freshmen; 28
male; age: M = 21.63, SD = 3.11) randomly assigned to four
groups according to a 2x2 independent factorial design. We
varied whether participants received a pre-training (pretraining versus no pre-training) and the format of the
presented learning environment (static versus dynamic).
Overall, there were four groups: pre-training and static; pretraining and dynamic; no pre-training and static; no pretraining and dynamic. Participants were tested in individual
sessions of approximately 60 minutes.
Materials
To test the additional effect of a dynamic presentation
format we created a learning environment in which the pipes
of the solar plant were animated and showed the direction of
the flow. The path of flow was presented as an ongoing and
repeating loop of energy. All other contents were identical
in every detail to the static presentation. All other materials
used in Study II, such as pre-training, tests for prior
knowledge, and learning outcomes, were identical to the
ones used in Study I. The test on learning outcomes
comprised again three subscales: structures of the system
(15 items, ICC = .955), processes (15 items, ICC = .891),
and functions of specific components (10 items, ICC =
.868).
Procedure
The procedure of Study II was identical to Study I, except
for the two additional conditions with dynamic learning
environment. After filling in a questionnaire on
demographics and the prior knowledge test, participants
were randomly assigned to the four conditions and
instructed to follow the learning environment. Finally,
participants worked on the posttest.

Results
Table 2 displays the means and standard deviations for all
dependent variables of interest. There was a positive
relationship between pretest performance and the learning
outcomes, r = .399, p < .001, but a non-significant
relationship between the grade in physics and learning
outcomes, r = .118, p =.254. There was no significant
difference between the pre-training and the no-pre-training
condition on the pretest, F(1, 95) = 1.571, p = .213, ηp2 =
.016, no difference between the different presentation
formats on the pretest, F(1, 95) = .377, p =.541, ηp2 = .004,
and also no interaction between training and presentation
format on the pretest, F(1, 95) = .417, p = .529, ηp2 = .004.
A factorial analysis of variance including pretest as
covariate was applied to test the hypotheses regarding
effects on learning outcomes.
Testing the hypotheses that provision of pre-training and a
dynamic presentation format would positively affect
learning outcomes, we found a significant main effect of
training (H1a), F(1, 94) = 5.085, p = .026, ηp2 = .051,
indicating that pre-training fostered learning. However,
there was a non-significant effect of presentation format on

.001. Moreover, the interaction between training group and
presentation format was non-significant (H1c), F(1, 94) =
0.647, p = .423, ηp2 = .007.
In a second step, we inspected the subscales of the
learning outcomes (H2a-H2c). The main effects of training,
F(1, 94) = 2.759, p = .100, ηp2 = .029, and presentation
format, F(1, 94) = 0.075, p = . 785, ηp2 = .001, as well as the
interaction effect, F(1, 94) = 0.311, p = .579, ηp2 = .003, on
structures, were not significant. Concerning the processes of
the learning material, we found a significant effect of
training, F(1, 94) = 5.698, p = .019, ηp2 = .057, showing that
presentation format, F(1, 94) = .111, p = .739, ηp2 = .001.
Last, there was no significant interaction effect, F(1, 94) =
0.341, p = .561, ηp2 = .004.
Addressing our next hypothesis whether participants
would accomplish more saccades in the direction of the pretraining, we found neither a main effect of training (H3a),
F(1, 95) = 1.280, p = .261, ηp2 = .013, nor a main effect of
presentation format (H3b), F(1, 95) = 0.098, p = .755, ηp2 =
.001. There was, however, a significant interaction
(training*presentation format) on the saccades within
semantic AOIs (H3c), F(1, 95) = 7.175, p = .009, ηp2 = .070.
Pre-training fostered congruent saccades in a static
representation, but not in a dynamic presentation (Figure 3).
In contrast, without pre-training, participants performed
more congruent saccades when a dynamic representation
was demonstrated, but not when a static representation was
demonstrated.

Finally, we analysed the Levenshtein distance for all strings
within each condition to examine the homogeneity of
fixations. There was a significant main effect of training
(H4a), F(1, 95) = 5.614, p = .020, ηp2 = .056, indicating that
eye movements within the pre-training group were more
homogeneous. In addition, there was a significant main
effect of presentation format according to which participants
who watched the dynamic representation had more
homogeneous eye movements (H4b), F(1, 95) = 4.239, p =
.042, ηp2 = .043. There was no significant interaction effect
(training*presentation format, H4c), F(1, 95) = 1.155, p =
.285, ηp2 = .012.

Discussion
In Study II we tested a 2x2 design manipulating training
(pre-training versus no-training) and presentation format
(static versus dynamic) to corroborate findings from Study I
and to investigate whether the effects of eye movement pretraining holds true when the representation is presented in a
dynamic manner. The findings confirmed a positive effect
of pre-training on learning outcomes which could be
primarily ascribed to processes. There was no effect of
presentation format and also no interaction effect between
training and presentation format on learning outcomes.
There were no main effects on saccades, but an interaction
indicating that participants with pre-training performed the
most congruent saccades when learning from a static
learning environment. We also found a main effect of pretraining on homogeneity of eye movements. In addition,
there was a main effect of presentation format according to
which a dynamic representation resulted in more
homogeneous eye movement behaviour.

On the basis of current research on eye movement modeling
and analogical thinking, the present studies investigated the
effect of eye movement pre-training on learning outcomes
and eye movements performed during the learning process.
In Study I, we expected that pre-training would lead to
better learning outcomes, more saccades in the direction
proposed by the pre-training, and more homogeneity. In
Study II, we expected an additional effect of a dynamic
presentation format. In both studies we found a stable effect
of pre-training on learning outcomes which could be
primarily ascribed to comprehension of processes presented

1447

in the learning materials. Contrary to our expectations, a
dynamic presentation format had no additional effect on
learning outcomes. There is evidence that dynamic diagrams
on technical systems do not promote learning with respect to
retention and transfer when compared to static diagrams
(Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, & Campbell, 2005). It is
concluded that learners require instructional assistance when
learning with animated representations. In this case, other
approaches are in need to boost learning with dynamic
representations in particular.
With regard to the homogeneity of eye movements we
found mixed findings. Study II, however, indicates that pretraining and a dynamic representation can result in more
similar eye movements. The results on saccades are
inconclusive so far. Study I and Study II revealed a nonsignificant main effect of training. There was, however, an
interaction effect. Alternatively, the poor link between
saccades and learning outcomes could be explained by
memory processes. Traces of the pre-training could have
been memorized and recalled from long-term-memory
during the learning processes without being performed. The
eye movement pre-training could have triggered processes
that could not be captured by eye tracking methods.
Finally some methodological concerns should be
mentioned. Overall, the subscales measuring knowledge of
structures, processes, and functions were related, all ps <
.01. However, from a conceptual perspective of the
framework, the knowledge types of technical systems are
interdependent: processes are derived from structures and
functions build on processes. In addition, some studies show
that retention and transfer knowledge can also be correlated
(Mayer et al., 2005). The question remains whether future
research can develop a more sensitive assessment tool to
reflect different knowledge levels of technical systems.
One disadvantage of expert models is that different
experts do not always react in the same way to the same
stimulus, and their behavior is based on differences in their
learning history and professional background (Jarodzka et
al., 2010b). Thus, a follow-up study should address more
moderating variables (such as learning history, sex, and
profession) and develop an eye movement pre-training
based on real eye movements from an expert who
corresponds very closely to the characteristics of the sample.
In summary, there seems to be more to learning
(memorizing and understanding) than just meets the bare
eye. Current theories on eye movements heavily refer to
research on reading comprehension (e.g. immediacy
assumption and eye-mind assumption by Just & Carpenter,
1980) which do not necessarily apply to comprehension of
complex graphics and pictures. From our point of view, it is
important to develop specific theoretical approaches for eye
movements in learning from graphics to understand the
underlying processes. The present studies make a significant
contribution to this field in demonstrating that eye
movements can be circumspectly used to foster learning
from pictures. In sum, a non-verbal pre-training can
successfully foster comprehension of processes in a static as

well as a dynamic learning content. Moreover, learners have
similar fixation strings following such a pre-training. The
meaning of saccades on learning processes could not be
clarified in this context and requires further investigations.
