Abstract
Episodic memory formation is associated with large-scale
neuronal activity distributed across the cortex. Decades of
neuroimaging and patient lesion studies demonstrated the
correlation between the roles of specific brain structures in
episodic memory retrieval. Distributed, coordinated and
synchronized activities across brain regions have also been
investigated. However, neuronal mechanisms based on
effective connectivity underlying the coordination of this
anatomically distributed information processing into
introspectively coherent cognition have remained largely
unknown. Here we investigate the information flow network
of the human brain during episodic memory retrieval. We
have estimated local oscillation amplitudes and asymmetric
inter-areal synchronization from EEG recordings in individual
cortical anatomy by using source reconstruction techniques
and effective connectivity methods during episodic memory
retrieval. The strength and spectro-anatomical patterns of
these inter-areal interactions in sub-second time-scales reveal
that the episodic memory retrieval involves the increase of
information flow and densely interconnected networks
between the prefrontal cortex, the medial temporal lobe, and
some subregions of the parietal cortex. In this network,
interestingly, the SFG acted as a hub, globally interconnected
across broad brain regions.

Introduction
The next step in the progression of neuroscience is building
neuro-cognitive models that describe the dynamics and
interaction patterns of brain regions on a macroscopic scale.
Indeed, recent advances in cognitive neuroscience have
focused on the role of inter-areal interactions between
various specialized brain regions and functional
connectivity in human cognition (Stevens, 2009; Yarkoni et
al., 2010, Park & Friston, 2013).
The study of human brain connectivity generally falls
under three categories: structural, functional, and effective
connectivity (Bullmore & Sporns, 2009). Structural
connectivity refers to the static anatomical structure of the
brain. This can be studied in vivo using invasive axonal
labeling techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI,
Lauterbur, 1973) or diffusion tensor imaging (Moseley et al.,

833

1990) devices. Both functional and effective connectivity
are defined with respect to a cognitive task and denote
synchronized activity of two neuroanatomical regions
during task execution. However, effective connectivity is
able to deal with asymmetric or causal dependencies
between the two regions, while functional connectivity has
only a symmetrical nature. Thus, the term ‚Äúinformation flow‚Äù
is often used to indicate directionally specific effective
connectivity between two brain structures. Dynamic causal
modeling (DCM), structural equation modeling (SEM),
transfer entropy, and Granger-causal methods are popular
effective connectivity methods and they can be applied to
functional MRI (fMRI) and/or electrophysiological imaging
data such as electroencephalography (EEG), intracranial
EEG (iEEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG).
Episodic memory formation is a complex neurocognitive
process that is associated with large-scale neuronal activity
distributed across the cortex. However, neuronal
mechanisms based on the effective connectivity underlying
the coordination of this anatomically distributed processing
have remained largely unknown.
Decades of neuroimaging and patient lesion studies
correlated the roles of specific brain regions to episodic
memory retrieval such as the prefrontal cortex (Blumenfeld
& Ranganath, 2007; Duarte et al., 2005), the medial
temporal lobe (Eichenbaum et al., 2007; Mitchell & Johnson,
2009; Squire et al., 2004; Simons & Spiers, 2003; VarghaKadem et al., 1997) and some subregions of the parietal
cortex (Hutchinson et al., 2009; Spaniol et al., 2009; Vilberg
& Rugg, 2008).
Furthermore, distributed and coordinated activities across
brain regions are regarded to be important to the memory
retrieval processes (Buzs√°ki, 1996; Eichenbaum, 2000;
McClelland et al., 1995; Nadel & Moscovitch, 1997;
Norman & O'Reilly, 2003; Teyler & DiScenna, 1986).
Synchronized activity in the local field potential (LFP) is
also related to coordinating these processes (Fell &
Axmacher, 2011).
Recently, following these previous findings, frequency
multiplexing of brain regions involved in episodic memory
retrieval (Watrous et al., 2013) have also been studied, but
effective connectivity has not yet been considered.
Here in this paper, we are primarily concerned with the
information flow network of the human brain during

episodic memory retrieval. We have estimated local
oscillation amplitudes and asymmetric inter-areal
synchronization from EEG recordings in individual cortical
anatomy by using source reconstruction techniques and the
effective connectivity method during episodic memory
retrieval.

and the participant watches an episode of a television sitcom
for 27 minutes. The spoken language in the movie is
American English, and subtitles are not displayed. After
watching the movie for memory acquisition, the participant
continues to perform 20 rounds of the memory retrieval
session. First, the participant stares at a cross in the center of
the screen during the fixation task. Then, the participant is
provided with a video clip of the movie as a retrieval cue.
During the retrieval task, two still images captured in the
following scene from the retrieval cue in a random order are
presented. The participant is asked to decide whether the
order of the two images is correct or incorrect using a small
keypad.

Materials and Methods
Participants and electrophysiology setup
Eight neurologically healthy participants (mean age, 24.3 ¬±
2.7 years; 4 women) gave informed consent, which was
approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at the
Clinical Research Institute of Seoul National University
Hospital for the protection of human subjects.
Electrophysiological methods and electrode localization
were similar to those described previously (Lee et al., 2012).
In brief, participants wore a cap equipped with 128
Ag/AgCl electrodes. Eye movements and blinks were
monitored by horizontal and vertical electrooculography
signals. Impedance was maintained at 5‚Äì10 kŒ© or less. EEG
signals were sampled at 1,000 Hz/channel using a
Neuroscan SynAmps amplifier (Neuroscan, El Paso, TX).
Signals were referenced to a common average consisting of
a ground and reference electrodes over frontal and lateral
temporal areas to minimize the effect of the referencing
scheme on synchronization measures (Nunez & Srinivasan,
2006). Recordings were then imported into MATLAB
(MathWorks, Natick, MA) for analyses.

Preprocessing and source reconstruction
All analyses used EEGLAB (Delorme & Makeig, 2004),
SIFT (Mullen et al., 2010, Delorme et al., 2011) and
custom-written codes in MATLAB. Raw EEG signals from
the memory recall game were extracted for both the fixation
and retrieval query tasks from 1 second before to 2 seconds
following each task. Our primary behavioral contrast was
retrieval versus fixation (non-retrieval).
Following FIR band-pass filtering between 2.0 and 50.0
Hz to exclude unnecessary frequencies, EEG signals were
subjected to the independent component analysis (ICA). A
dual symmetric equivalent dipole model was then fit to each
source signal using EEGLAB ºs Dipfit2 plugin with a fourshell spherical head model.

Effective connectivity estimation

Behavioral task
Participants play a memory recall game depicted in Figure 1.
The game consists of two sessions which naturally lead a
participant to remember and recall several episodic
memories. The game begins with a tutorial composed of a
concise example set of whole tasks in order to allow the
participant to become accustomed to the game environment.
Following the tutorial, the memory encoding session starts

Information flows between inter-areal sources of EEG were
measured by computing the direct directed transfer function
(dDTF, Korzeniewska et al., 2003) for each pair of source
signals. The dDTF is measure of direct information transfer
among brain structures on the basis of LFP. First, the
directed transfer function (DTF) is formulated in the
framework of a multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model
fitted to the EEG signal. The MVAR model is expressed as:
ùëù

ùëã(ùë°) = ‚àëùëö=1 ùê∂(ùëö)ùëã(ùë° ‚àí ùëö) + ùê∏(ùë°) ,

(1)

ùëã(ùëì) = ùëå(ùëì)ùê∏(ùëì),

(2)

where X(t) is a vector of k EEG signals recorded in time t,
E(t) is the vector of multivariate uncorrelated white noise
process, C(m) are the k √ó k matrices of model coefficients,
and p is the model order. The model order is determined by
means of criteria such as Akaike information criterion,
Schwarz-Bayes criterion, the final prediction error criterion,
Hannan-Quinn criterion (L√ºtkepohl, 2006).
In order to investigate the spectral properties between the
signals, the Fourier transformation is applied to (1) where
the transform functions are of the form:
Figure 1: Experimental setup and EEG acquisition. EEG
signals are recorded during 20 trials of the retrieval session
in the memory recall game and extracted for fixation and
retrieval query tasks from 1 second before to 2 seconds after
the onset of each task throughout 128 electrodes.

[0, 1] where a value close to 1 means a consistent

However, the full frequency DTF (ffDTF, Korzeniewska
et al., 2003) uses another procedure of normalization
expressed as (4), so that its spectral properties depend only
on the outflow of that channel, not on the frequency:

Active brain regions during retrieval
The time-varying dDTF estimates were obtained by using a
sliding-window MVAR model with a 500 ms window
length and 10 ms step size producing 251 time points. The
dDTF is integrated over the frequency band between 2 and
50 Hz.
The dDTF evaluation revealed prominent information
flow increases between frontal cortex (superior frontal gyrus,
SFG; middle frontal gyrus, MFG; inferior frontal gyrus, IFG;
prefrontal cortex, PFC), and specific subregions of medial
temporal (hypothalamus, HYP; thalamus, THA; medial
temporal lobe, MTL), parietal (precuneus, PCN; inferior
parietal lobe, IPL) and occipital (primary visual cortex, PVC)
regions when participants retrieved the episodic memory
from the memory recall game. The importance of these
regions in episodic memory retrieval is consistent with those
established through previous decades of work (Blumenfeld
& Ranganath, 2007; Mitchell & Johnson, 2009; Hutchinson
et al., 2009; and so on). Thus, we restricted subsequent

Consequently, the dDTF can be derived by the product of

analyses to the information flow of 90 source signal pairs
consisting of these ten active brain regions.
Increased information flow from MFG to MTL was
visually evident in a lower frequency band (2‚Äì15 Hz) during
retrieval tasks compared with fixation as shown in Figure 2
(c, d). Individual raw EEG traces also revealed that
oscillatory powers of MFG typically increased following the
retrieval tasks as shown in Figure 2 (a, b), however, these
individual changes could not describe the specific direction
of the interregional information flow.

Significant time-frequency zone
To clarify the active information flows associated with
specific frequency and time bands, we found time-frequency
areas showing significantly different dDTF between fixation
and retrieval tasks. Each of differences between dDTF
values of fixation and retrieval is tested by the two sample ttest with fixed time and frequency. As shown in Figure 3,
time ranges between 0‚Äì1000 ms and frequency ranges
between 2‚Äì30 Hz showed significant differences (pt-test <
0.05). Differences around 1500 ms were significant as well,
but this time band was not considered as an analysis target
because it was too delayed from the onset of stimuli and
could be caused by irrelative facts.

Information flow increases in active brain regions
The estimated information flow between the 90 active brain
region pairs in the preferred frequencies (4 and 8 Hz) and
time band (0‚Äì1000 ms) are depicted in Figure 4 (a, b). We
found statistically meaningful increases in most of the pairs
during retrieval tasks (pt-test < 0.05, 76 pairs in 4 Hz and 80
pairs in 8 Hz).

Hz frequency. (c) Effective connectivity network during

To evaluate topological interactions across the brain
regions, we adopted a graph theoretic approach. We treated
each brain region as a node in a network that was
functionally connected considering its directions via dDTF
at a given time (300 ms) and frequency (2‚Äì30 Hz) as seen in
Figure 4 (c). We found a densely interconnected network
during retrieval while fixation had only sparse local
networks in the frontal and occipital-medial temporal area.
Importantly, there were a number of asymmetries regarding
the estimated information flow between brain regions (e.g.
MFG ÔÉ† MTL; MTL ÔÉ† PFC).
While overall increases in connectivity across the network
during memory retrieval were observed, specific brain
region such as SFG acted as a hub. SFG showed global
connectivity with overall brain regions.

parietal cortex is associated with top-down processes that
support retrieval search, monitoring and verification.
Overall, our study provides a new perspective on how the
human brain processes episodic memory retrieval. By
employing effective EEG connectivity and a graph theoretic
approach, our results could support episodic memory
retrieval models that emphasize globally dense network and
time-frequency-specific effective connectivity, rather than
regionally mediated activity alone or an undirected
functional connectivity.

Discussion and Conclusion
We sought to determine the effective network interactions
among brain regions that have been implicated in episodic
memory retrieval. We estimated information flows from
EEG signals recorded during tasks of a memory recall game.
A source reconstruction technique was used for estimating
the activity of the neuronal sources generating the sensor
level data, attenuating the problem of field spread. To
measure the effective connectivity, the dDTF method based
on an MVAR model was adopted in order to calculate
directed causal relations between source signals and to deal
with short epochs of EEG activities.
We revealed that episodic memory retrieval could be
characterized by increase of information flows between the
prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and the parietal
cortex, along with the globally interconnected effective
connectivity network of them across the 2‚Äì30 Hz frequency
band. Interestingly, SFG acted as a hub in the network
during memory retrieval. Because SFG is a key component
of the neural network of memory process and the
participation of this region in memory process is triggered
by the highest level of executive processing (Boisgueheneuc
et al., 2006), these findings could be consistent with many
decades of work that point to the importance of SFG in
episodic memory retrieval task.
Our results also emphasize asymmetric information flows
between brain regions. To the best of our knowledge, this
has not been studied previously with non-invasive human
brain signal recordings. We found a meaningful result
regarding this matter, related to the information flows of
parietal cortex. The parietal cortex is one of the regions that
is most frequently activated during episodic-memory
retrieval. Our effective connectivity analysis showed the
information flow of the superior parietal regions (PCN) and
PVC are significantly changed. During the retrieval task, the
information flow is activated from SFG to PCN that is
inverse direction of the non-retrieval task. This result could
partially support the dual process model of attention to
memory (Cabeza, 2008), which presented the superior
