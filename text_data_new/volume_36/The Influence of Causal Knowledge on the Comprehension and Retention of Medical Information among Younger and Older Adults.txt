Abstract
Older adults are often susceptible to confusing or forgetting
medical instructions. The purpose of the present study was to
examine the effects of causal knowledge on the learning and
retention of medical information among younger and older
adults. Participants were asked to read about a fictitious
disease with or without explanations on the cause-and -effects
of illness management. A multiple-choice knowledge test was
administered immediately and 1-week following the
presentation of health booklets. Results demonstrated that
causal knowledge facilitated the application and retention of
novel medical knowledge across time for younger adults. In
contrast, causal explanations did not seem to influence the
test performances of older participants. After controlling for
age, verbal ability, working memory, and health literacy,
provision of causal explanation explained a significant
amount of unique variance in test performance. Incorporating
causal explanations in health education materials may have
the potential to help patients acquire medical knowledge.

Introduction
Poor acquisition of medical knowledge is common among
older adults (65 years and older) and is linked to patient
non-adherence to self-care recommendations as well as
frequent hospital readmissions (Andrus & Roth, 2002;
Cameron et al., 2009; Cline et al., 1999). A recurrent finding
is that age-related changes in working memory, processing
speed, and inhibitory control can render it difficult for older
adults to connect unfamiliar health concepts and ideas
(Brown & Park, 2002; Johnson, 2003; van der Lindin et al.,
1999). Past efforts to mitigate age-related differences in
learning have focused on using illustrations to structure the
content, and ordering medical instructions to fit patient
preferences (Brown & Park, 2003; Liu et al., 2009; Morrow
et al., 1999). Although formatting strategies can aid memory
performance (Morrow et al., 2005), they do not sufficiently
address the range of elderly learning needs. Notably absent
from the literature are effective ways to help older adults

form a comprehensible mental representation of their illness
condition.
Supporting evidence in the literature on clinical reasoning
suggests that increasing knowledge of causal relationships
helps individuals to retain and apply new medical
information more easily (Woods, Brooks & Norman, 2005).
Causal information refers to explanations about why an
effect occurs or how things work (Keil, 2006; Murphy &
Median, 1985). One study demonstrated that non-medical
students were able to interpret respiratory exams better
when they were given booklets with causal information that
explained why different physical sounds were made during
the medical test (Goldszmidt, Minda, Devantier, Skye &
Woods, 2011). Similarly, it has been shown that
experienced clinical psychologists and trainees integrated
causal information about the etiology of a psychiatric
condition to improve the accuracy their diagnostic and
treatment decisions (de Kwaadsteniet, Kim & Yopchick,
2013). These findings suggest that providing causal
information for medical concepts helps individuals form a
coherent conceptualization of the presenting issue, which in
turn enhances the diagnostic process.
The finding that causal information advances clinical
judgment raises the question of whether explaining the
cause-and-effects of disease management can similarly
benefit patients’ understanding of their medical conditions.
According to Common Sense Model of Illness
Representations (CSM), patients’ emotional and cognitive
processing of their condition depends on five attributes: 1)
beliefs that they have an illness, 2) beliefs about the illness
cause, 3) beliefs about illness course, 4) beliefs about the
illness consequences, and 5) beliefs about the controllability
of the condition (Leventhal, Meyers & Nerenz, 1984). The
CSM posits that information from all attributes help form an
individuals’ illness representation and guide the
development of subsequent health coping behaviors.
In light of the tenets in the CSM, patients’ understanding
of illness causes seems to be one of the key factors that
shape their knowledge about the disease. In a meta-analysis
of 45 empirical studies on the CSM, only the identity,

chronicity, curability, and controllability dimensions have
been linked to illness perceptions and coping behaviors
(Hagger & Orbell, 2003). The effects of causal beliefs on
illness appraisals are less clear because of the inconsistent
operationalization of this construct in the literature.
However, the limited research on this dimension suggests
that false beliefs about disease pathophysiology are linked
to medication non-adherence (Jessop & Rutter, 2003).
Addressing these inaccurate perceptions through the
provision of causal information may strengthen patients’
understanding of illness management.
The main purpose of this study was to elucidate whether
the inclusion of causal information, which explicitly links
illness management with symptoms, would improve health
users’ understanding of novel medical concepts. Building on
Goldszmidt and colleagues’ (2011) findings, the present
study aims to determine the age-related effects of causal
knowledge on the immediate and delayed retention of
information presented in a health brochure. It was
hypothesized that: 1) Causal explanations will enhance the
ability for both younger and older adults to interpret and
recall health information 2) Causal explanations will be a
significant predictor of medical knowledge after controlling
for demographic and cognitive factors.

Sample Causal Information
[Presented on same page]:
What to do: Consume 3-4 glasses
of high carbohydrate drinks each
day
Why: Alphabet disease makes it
difficult for your body to produce
essential fats and carbohydrates
that give you energy. Consuming
high carbohydrate drinks will
supply you with the energy you
need.

Sample Non-Causal Information
Alphabet disease occurs when
your liver has difficulty breaking
down Alphabetin into vitamin
ABC. Your body needs vitamin
ABC to metabolize proteins, keep
your immune system strong and
produce fats and carbohydrates.
As a result, individuals with
Alphabet disease have a build up
of proteins and not enough fats
and carbohydrates.
[Presented on a separate page]:
Consume 3-4 glasses of natural
juices and energy drinks each day

material was presented in a causal and non-causal way. The
dotted line represents information that was shown on a
separate page in the booklet.

Methods
Participants
Younger participants were 50 undergraduate students (%
female = 68.0; mean age = 19.28; SD = 3.09) attending the
University of Western Ontario (UWO) in London, ON.
Thirty-five community-dwelling older adults (% female =
65.70; mean age = 71.47; SD = 7.19) also took part in the
study. The inclusion criteria included fluency in English
and no prior training in medical professions. Older adults
were offered $20 (CAD) and younger adults were granted
course credits for the completion of the 2-part study.

Health Knowledge Quiz. A 25-item multiple choice health
information quiz (HIQ) created in this study was used to test
participants’ understanding and retention of the health
booklet. The measure included ten control items that gauged
knowledge for content that was not dependent on presence
of causal knowledge (i.e., questions about the triggers and
prevalence of Alphabet disease). The remaining fifteen
critical items tapped into the extent to which causal
information influenced understanding of how to apply selfcare management routines. All critical and control items
included four response choices and a point was given for
each correctly answered item (see Figure 2 for sample
items). The total number of correct items was tallied for the
control and critical items as well as for the entire scale. A
higher total score on the knowledge questionnaire indicates
better comprehension of the health information.

Materials

Sample Critical Item:

Health Information Booklets. The symptoms and self-care
recommendations of three metabolic conditions (Urea Cycle
Disorder, Biotin Deficiency and Short-chain acyl-CoA
Dehydrogenase Deficiency) served as the design basis for
the learning materials. The resultant health booklets
described the triggers, prevalence, symptoms and self-care
management of a fictitious disorder, ‘Alphabet Disease’.
The first two sections about the triggers and prevalence of
the target illness were presented in the same fashion for both
learning conditions. The sections about symptoms and selfcare management were the testing components. For the
causal-knowledge (CK) group, the health booklet explained
self-care management in the context of the symptom it is
intended to placate. Information about disease symptoms
and self-care behaviors was not explicitly linked for
participants in the no causal knowledge (NCK) condition.
See Figure 1 for an example.

Cognitive Measures. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy
in Medicine- Short Form (REALM-SF; Arozullah et al.,
2007) was a 7-item word recognition task used to assess
participant health literacy. The scoring for the questionnaire
ranged from 0 (no words pronounced correctly) to 7(all the
words are pronounced correctly). The Forward and
Backward Digit Span task from the Weschler Adult
Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV; Pearson, 2008) was used
to assess working memory span. The task required
participants to recall a progressively longer series of digits
in either a forward or backward order. A higher number of
correct trials recalled reflect a larger working memory
capacity. Finally, two passages from the Nelson-Denny
Reading Test (FORM H; Brown, Bennet & Hanna, 1993)
were used to assess verbal ability skills of participants. The
test required participants to read narrative passages and
answer multiple-choice items, each with 5 answer choices.

provision of causal information was dummy coded and
entered in the final step.

Results

Procedures
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two
booklet conditions. The study was completed individually or
in groups of up to three individuals in two sessions that
were held one week apart. Testing took place either in the
Categorization Lab at UWO or at a seniors’ community
center. Upon obtaining informed consent, participants were
asked to read and study the health information booklet to the
best of their ability. They were told that the material will not
be shown again during testing and that they can take as
much time as they need to learn the information. Following
the methodological design used in a study of same construct
(Goldszmidt et al., 2011), the HIQ was administered
immediately after participants returned the booklet (Test 1),
and after 1-week delay (Test 2). The administration of the
remaining battery of cognitive measures either took place
during the first or second testing session depending on the
participant flow. Most younger adults took between 20 and
30 minutes to complete each testing session, while older
adults took around 30-45 minutes to get through the
material.

Statistical Analyses
The mean proportion correct on the HIQ was calculated
for control and critical set of items at both Test 1 and Test 2
(see Table 1). Independent t-tests were used to determine
overall age group differences on test performance across
time. Due to the unequal sample sizes, test performance
differences were analyzed separately for each age group
using 2x2x2 mixed factorial ANOVAs with Bonferroni
correction. Booklet condition (CK/NCK) was entered as the
between subjects factor, and the within-subject factors
comprised of time (Test 1/Test 2) and item type
(Control/Critical). Pearson-moment correlations and
hierarchical regressions were also conducted to determine
the effects of booklet condition on knowledge retention after
controlling for demographic and cognitive predictors. Age
was entered in the first step, verbal ability, working memory
and health literacy were entered in the second step, and

Of the participants enrolled in the study, one younger and
two older adults did not complete Time 2. As such, data
analyses were conducted on 49 younger and 33 older adults.
Table 1 shows the mean proportion correct on critical and
control items across age group and time. Younger adults
significantly outperformed older adults in the HIQ for both
Test 1 (t(83) = -7.81, p < .001) and Test 2 (t(54.31) = -9.14,
p < .001). Among younger adults, there was a significant
three way interaction of booklet condition x item x time, F
(1,47) = 5.32, p = .026. Both CK and NCK groups did
equally well on control items but participants who received
causal information scored significantly higher on critical
items than the comparison group, F (1, 47) = 19.45, p <
.001. Pairwise t-tests were conducted for each booklet
condition to determine the effects of time on the proportion
of correct critical and control items. The CK group showed
no change in proportion of correct control (t(23) = 1.80, p
=.086) and critical items (t(23) = .72, p = .480) between
Test 1 and Test 2, indicating that performance did not
decline over time for this group. However, the NCK group
demonstrated a decrease in performance for control items
after the 1-week delay, t(24) = 2.40, p = .026. In comparison
to the CK group, those without causal information made
significantly more errors with critical items for both time
points, t(23) = -5.38, p = .002. These findings demonstrated
that difficulty with answering critical items and failure to
retain information over time contributed to the
comparatively poorer performance of the NCK group.
With regards to older adults, significant main effects of
time and item were found, such that performance was
significantly better during Test 1, and for control items, F
(1, 21) = 4.13, p = .05, F (1, 21) = 14.83, p = .001,
respectively. However, the interaction between time and
item type was not significant, F (1, 21) = .68, p = .418.
Contrary to our predictions, there was no effect of booklet
condition, suggesting that causal information did not
facilitate retention of medical information for older adults, F
(1, 21) = .075, p = .786.

Bivariate correlations showed that several cognitive and
demographic factors were also associated with performance
on the knowledge questionnaire (Table 2). Results from a
hierarchical regression (Table 3) illustrated that age
explained 37.4% of variance in overall performance on
critical items in Test 1, F (1, 75) = 44.81, p < .001. The
inclusion of verbal ability, working memory span and health
literacy in the second step significantly improved the model
by adding 9% unique variance, F (2, 72) = 4.04, p = .010.
Finally, the provision of causal information accounted for a
significant amount of variance (5%) in health information
recall above and beyond age and other cognitive factors, F
(1, 71) = 6.89, p = .011. Combined, the predictors explained
51.20% of the variance in knowledge of critical items for
Test 1, which was a large effect.
At Time 2 (Table 4), age accounted for 43.3% of the
variance in critical item performance, F (1, 70) = 53.39, p <
.001. Interestingly, the addition of other cognitive predictors
did not add significant explanatory variance (F∆ (3, 67) =
2.31, p = .085). The provision of causal information
remained a significant predictor of Test 2 performance on
critical items, contributing 3.5% of unique explanatory
variance, (F∆ (1, 66) = 4.80, p = .032). The overall model
has a R2 of 52.1%, which is a large effect.

Discussion
Performance on a test of novel health information was
significantly enhanced for younger adults who received
patient education booklets that explained the cause and
effects of illness self- management. Specifically, the
provision of causal information led to higher accuracy on
items that required individuals to make inferences about the
application of medical knowledge. As well, younger adults
in the CK group retained more medical knowledge across
time than their same age NCK comparisons, suggesting that
causal explanations helped with the consolidation of
unfamiliar health information.
The present findings are consistent with previous reports
that incorporating basic sciences in medical curriculums
helps to emphasize causal connections in medical exams;
hence, improving the diagnostic skills of inexperienced
trainees (Goldszmidt et al., 2011; Woods et al., 2009). This
study is unique in showing that causal information also
benefits the learning of disease management for health
users. It is likely that information about self-care strategies
becomes more salient for individuals who receive
explanations about the connection between illness causes
and outcome. As discussed in past studies (Jessop & Rutter,
2003; Price et al., 2013), understanding of illness
pathophysiology was associated with greater knowledge
about medication purpose and higher treatment compliance.
There is, therefore, compelling evidence that causal
explanations are a valuable component to be included in
medical training and patient education tool for younger
adults.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
evaluate the effects of causal explanations on the learning
and memory of medical information in older adults.
Contrary to our predictions and in contrast to the results
with younger adults, there were no significant differences in
test performance between elderly individuals in the CK and
NCK group. This raises an interesting question as to why
the advantages of including causal explanations in health
information materials disappeared with age.

1841

The current results showed that older adults in both
groups achieved an accuracy of around 50% on both tests,
which was significantly lower than the performance of
younger participants. One possible explanation for the
general low performance of older adults could be that the
task of learning about an artificial disease contradicted their
prior medical knowledge. Past research shows that older
adults are more resistant to adopting new accurate medical
information that disconfirms previous beliefs (Adams,
Rogers & Fisk, 2011; Hancock, Fisk & Rogers, 2005; Okun
& Rice, 2001; Rice & Okun, 1994). The intended novelty of
the health booklets may have inadvertently interfered with
any potential benefits of causal explanations for older
adults. Using medical conditions that are common among a
geriatric population as the target health learning material
may serve to elucidate the value of causal knowledge in a
patient context.
Bearing in mind that the present study was not designed
to equally sample from each subgroup of old age, it would
be premature to conclude that all elderly individuals failed
to benefit from learning causal information. Research has
shown that there are marked differences in cognitive
function between young-old (65-74 years), middle-old (7584) and oldest-old (85+) individuals (Newson, Kemps &
Luszcz, 2003). This study may have misrepresented the test
performance of the older sample by collapsing all
participants above 65-years into a single group. The present
findings illustrated that the provision of cause-and-effect
linkages predicted Test 1 and 2 performances above and
beyond age and other cognitive variables. This suggests that
there may be merit to further examine the utility of causal
explanations for reducing age-related differences in
acquisition of medical information. Distinguishing between
varying levels of medical knowledge among subgroups of a
geriatric sample may better explain the impact of causal
information on older adults.
There were several other limitations that may have
affected the interpretation of the current study results. First,
it is difficult to gauge the intrinsic motivation for
participants to learn the health information. Patients in
clinics, unlike research participants, may be more inclined
to learn about an actual diagnosis and therefore, may be
more sensitive to the presentation of health information.
Second, the present study did not control for the effects of
metacognition among participants. It has been documented
that older adults lack confidence in their ability to acquire
new information (Price, Hertzog & Dunlosky, 2010), which
suggests that some elderly individuals may not be
performing at their fullest potential in this study. As well, it
could be that the use of a multiple-choice survey is not the
best measure of medical knowledge for older adults who are
unaccustomed to this testing format. Efforts to minimize the
artificial nature of the testing environment may help to
reduce these confounding factors.
It also should be mentioned that the differences in
performance between the younger adult groups could not be
attributed to the inclusion of causal information alone. The

CK, but not the NCK, group received information about
disease management and symptomology on the same page.
It is plausible that this style of organization contributed to
the higher retention seen in the CK condition. Previous
studies have cited the importance of layout design of health
materials for patient education (Morrow et al., 2005). As
such, the effect of presenting causal information in different
formats is an area that warrants further study.
In conclusion, the present study has highlighted that
causal explanations can improve the comprehension and
retention of novel health information. This effect is salient
even after controlling for existing verbal memory, working
memory span and health literacy. The benefit of using
cause-and-effect descriptions in health information
resources for older adults has yet to be determined. The
development of health education materials tailored to the
learning needs of elderly individuals has significant
implications for patient-centered care.
