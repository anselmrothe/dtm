performance and identify which cognitive system is affected
by PSs. To test our CPC model, we focus on a chemical called
toluene, a colorless and odorless solvent commonly found in
products, such as paint and adhesives, and is present in many
work environments. Several studies have shown that acute
and chronic toluene exposure leads to performance deficits in
terms of RT or accuracy on a wide array of cognitive tasks
(Rahill et al., 1996; Tang et al., 2011). What remains unclear
is which cognitive system is affected by toluene exposure.
For example, RT could increase as a result of a slowdown in
attentional processing, motor execution, or memory retrieval.
