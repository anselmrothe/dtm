   The second model in the experiment starts at the top of
the list of songs; the first song on the list is unattended, so it
encodes it and considers whether to listen to it. The model
decides that it will listen to it and then must decide if it
should download it. There is a 50% chance the model will
download it, which it does in this case. This song now
becomes the most popular with rank 1 and for future
participants it will show as the top song on the display. The
model then searches for another song, again decides to
search from the top and finds the second song, which is the
top unattended song. The second song does not look
interesting, so the model does not listen to it (and thus does
not download it, either). The model next searches for                     2
