   To address this question, we examined whether 20-
month-old infants expected members of a social group to
share food preferences. Several decades of research suggest
that by this age, infants attribute preferences to agents (e.g.,
Woodward, 1998). Moreover, by 18 months infants assume
that an agent’s preference is specific to that individual
unless given indication otherwise (Egyed, Király, &
Gergely, 2013). This allowed us to test whether social-group
membership overrides this default assumption. We focused
specifically on food preferences because foods are culturally
relevant and thus likely to be shared amongst members of a
social group (Cashdan, 1998; Rozin & Siegal, 2003).
   Infants were tested in a violation-of-expectation task                   Figure 1: Familiarization trial 1 of the same-group
