   Shortly after the completion of the choice-reaching
experiment, participants received the state anxiety
questionnaire (Spielberger et al., 1983) and rated each
statement (e.g., “I feel afraid”) on a four-point scale (20
questions in total). This questionnaire has been used widely
to assess generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). In this study,
we focused on anxiety for our analysis because anxiety is one
of the key affective states that arise at the time of cognitive
disequilibrium, and anxiety is also a key emotion pertinent to
deep learning (D’Mello, Dale, & Graesser, 2011).
