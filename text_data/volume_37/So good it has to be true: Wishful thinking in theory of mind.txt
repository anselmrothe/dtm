                              Abstract
   In standard decision theory, rational agents are objective,
   keeping their beliefs independent from their desires (Berger,
   1985). Such agents are the basis for current computational
   models of Theory of Mind (ToM), but this fundamental as-
   sumption of the theory remains untested. Do people think that
   others’ beliefs are objective, or do they think that others’ de-
   sires color their beliefs? We describe a Bayesian framework
   for exploring this relationship and its implications. Motivated        Figure 1: Causal models of (a) ToM based upon classic
