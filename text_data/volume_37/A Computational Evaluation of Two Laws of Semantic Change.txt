Figure 1: Word pairs that illustrate differentiation and parallel change. (a) Semantic neighbors of “fragile” and “frail” in the
1890s and the 1990s. The two words begin as nearest neighbors but move apart over a century and end up closest to “delicate”
and “infirm” respectively. The semantic spaces shown were created from the Google Ngram corpus (Michel et al., 2010) using
the t-SNE algorithm for dimensionality reduction (Maaten & Hinton, 2008). (b) Distributions showing the contexts that are
linked most strongly with “fragile” and “frail.” Over the century, “frail” alone becomes strongly linked with “elderly” and
“older.” (c) Semantic neighbors of “imminent” and “impending” in the 1890s and the 1990s. Both words start out closest to
“menacing” but end up close to “gradual” and “incipient.” (d) Context distributions for “imminent” and “impending.” Over
