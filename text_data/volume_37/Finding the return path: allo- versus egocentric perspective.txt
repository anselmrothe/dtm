   In the current study the task will be to gather empirical
evidence for the ideal landmark position for providing a
route description in the different conditions: allocentric and
egocentric in combination with initial path and return path.
This will be systematically investigated in two experiments
with an allocentric and egocentric perspective, which results
in the following three hypotheses:
   Hypothesis 1: Describing the initial path will result in
higher landmark accuracy than describing the return path.
   Hypothesis 2: The position preference depends on the
wayfinder’s task (describing initial vs. return path).                   Figure 2: Exemplary intersection in the allocentric

preferences for the return path is a new finding but has
previously been assumed by Hamburger et al. (2013) on a
theoretical basis. Interestingly, for describing the return path
participants additionally used landmarks located at the
position before the intersection opposite to the direction of
turn, which from the perspective of the return path is located
behind the intersection in the direction of turn.
   It could be expected that arrows (spatial information)
instead of directional information (verbal) might produce
different patterns of results. However, preliminary
experiments so far do not reveal any differences with
respect to this issue.
        General Discussion and Conclusion
Hypothesis 1
   Previous experiments supported the assumption of higher
performance for an initial path in comparison to a return
path (Hamburger, et al. 2013; Hinterecker et al., 2014). The
current experiments just provided a descriptive tendency in
the assumed direction. This may be attributed to the                     Figure 6. Change of position preferences. Position D
