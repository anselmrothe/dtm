the instructions participants received while studying worked
examples and solving problems. The analogical comparison
condition was instructed to compare worked examples
(“What is similar across problems? What is different? What
do the similarities and differences tell you about the
concepts involved?”); the self-explanation condition was
instructed to generate explanations of worked examples
(“Self-explain the reasoning or justification for this solution.
Write out words to describe any symbols, and provide
conceptual justifications and principled reasoning to explain
the solution”); and the instructional explanations condition
was instructed to study the examples (“Remember to take
your time and study each worked example carefully”).
