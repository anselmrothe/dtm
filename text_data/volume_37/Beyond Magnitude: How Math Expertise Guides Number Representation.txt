in, subjects read an introduction to the experiment which
pointed out that numbers can have many properties such as
even or odd, large or small, prime, multiples of 3 and so on.
Participants were then instructed that, on each trial of the
study, they must decide which of two numbers is most
similar to a third, taking into account everything they know
about the three numbers. The experiment then randomly
selected three single-digit numbers (0-9) without
replacement and presented them on a computer screen. The
reference number was presented at the top of the screen, and
the two other numbers were presented below on the right or
left side of the screen. Participants made judgments by
pressing the left or right arrow key that corresponded to
their choice, after which the next triad would automatically
appear. Participants were told to complete as many
judgments as they could in 10 minutes. At the end of the
time limit, the experiment automatically terminated and a
debriefing message was displayed.
     To investigate the structure underlying participant
judgments, we used a form of non-metric multidimensional
scaling (non-metric MDS) to generate several low-
dimensional representations of the response data. This was
accomplished by using the participants’ responses to situate

Analysis
To compare the richness of the structures underlying expert
and novice judgments, we computed separate embeddings in
1-4 dimensions for each group using the same method as
Experiment 1. This allowed us to assess whether the
underlying dimensionality of representations governing
number judgments is similar or different in novices versus
experts. If experts possess richer knowledge about number
attributes, their performance should be best fit by a richer
(higher-dimensional) underlying representation.

We used logistic regression as a classifier to evaluate
whether the four number categories identified in Experiment
2—prime, parity, magnitude, and multiples of 3—would be
present in the 2D embeddings estimated for each group in
the ignore-magnitude condition.
       Figure 5 illustrates the 2D solution from non-metric
MDS and cross-validation classification accuracy for each
of the four categories across the expert and non-expert
groups.

magnitude on participants’ judgments of number similarity
in the triadic comparison task. By directing participants to
avoid using magnitude, and instead asking that they exercise
