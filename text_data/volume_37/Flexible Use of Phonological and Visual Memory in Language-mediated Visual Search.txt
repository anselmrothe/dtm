Procedure On each trial, participants saw a display with
four pictures (see Figure 1a). After a short delay, a spoken
instruction of the form The X is the target was presented
over headphones. Eye movements were monitored using an
EyeLink II head-mounted eye-tracking system, sampling at
250 Hz. A drift correction was performed every five trials.
The trial ended when a participant clicked on one of the
pictures in the visual display.

   In Experiment 2a, the synonym competitor picture was

in more looks to the synonym object in the dominant condi-

accessible name associated with the synonym competitor,
compared to the subordinate condition, where the name of
the target overlapped with the synonym competitor's less
