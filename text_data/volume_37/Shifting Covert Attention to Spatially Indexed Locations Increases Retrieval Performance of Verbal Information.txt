Response accuracy
This study assumed superior retrieval performance in the
match compared to the mismatch condition and that the re-
trieval performance in the central condition could fall in be-
tween the performance of the match and mismatch condi-
tions. Furthermore, concerning the gaze instruction, no dif-
ferences were assumed between the attention shift and the
eye movement conditions. Figure 3 shows the results of the
gaze instruction and tracking task manipulations on response
accuracy. To test our hypotheses, we calculated a contrast
analysis for comparing hypotheses (see Rosenthal, Rosnow,
& Rubin, 2000). We chose this analysis, because it allows
testing more precise hypothesis and with a higher statisti-
cal power than a standard analysis of variance (ANOVA).2                 Figure 3: Mean response accuracy for the three conditions of
