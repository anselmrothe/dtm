Stimuli in the set did not contain reduplicated (repeated)

Procedure
Two-alternative forced choice task Participants in the
forced-choice task were asked to decide whether each
nonword stimulus sounded more rounded or more pointed.
Participants sat at a desktop computer in a sound-attenuated
room. The experiment consisted of 570 trials, presented in
random order. Each trial began with a blank white screen,
after 1000 milliseconds the pseudoword played, then the
screen changed to show the two response options (Pointed,
Rounded) presented on the left and right sides of the screen.
Participants responded with a button press corresponding to
the response options displayed on the screen. The
configuration of response keys was counterbalanced across
participants. Auditory stimuli were played through
