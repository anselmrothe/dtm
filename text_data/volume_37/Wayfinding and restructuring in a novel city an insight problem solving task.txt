navigators made more than one error per intersection, they
were informed on the screen they have exceeded the error
limit and had to repeat the trial. The repetition aided the
consolidation of the correct route, as well as it deterred from
guessing because of the tediousness of repetitions.

movement decision. Finally, they had to respond to the
exact same two questions as at the beginning of the trial in
