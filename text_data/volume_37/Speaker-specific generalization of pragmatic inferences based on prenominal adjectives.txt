   Likewise, to generalize meaningfully from limited
instances of exposure, rational listeners integrate their prior
knowledge about the statistical structure of the linguistic
input with the data at hand (Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007). Given
the prevalent over-modification observed in natural
discourse, a single instance of a redundant adjective use
provides less reliable evidence that the speaker would be
non-optimal in other domains of pragmatic language use
compared to an instance of under-modification. Integration
of prior likelihoods would result in more conservative
generalization (at the speaker-level) from evidence of over-
modification compared to evidence of under-modification.
   In the current paper we first establish that speakers will
generalize information from a single pair of adjectives to
unseen adjectives in a speaker-specific manner (Experiment            Figure 1: Four image display in the Exposure Phase of
