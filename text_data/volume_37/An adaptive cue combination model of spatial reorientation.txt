The spatial world provides many cues to where things are.               has been proposed (e.g. Newcombe & Huttenlocher, 2006)
Because these cues usually converge, one way of thinking                but not yet computationally specified. The purpose of this

When there are large discrepancies between cues, perhaps re-

between cues according to the same considerations (Cheng,               We assume that an agent (e.g. a person or an animal) is inside
