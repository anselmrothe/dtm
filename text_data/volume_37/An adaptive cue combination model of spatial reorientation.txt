Abstract
Humans use a variety of strategies to reorient in space. There
are diverging views on whether spatial reorientation relies on
an encapsulated geometric module, an associative mechanism
or an adaptive combination of different cues. We test these proposals with a computational model that predicts human behavior in reorientation. By analyzing existing data from multiple
sources, we show evidence for an adaptive view of reorientation that combines information from geometry, direction and
language. Our work opens up opportunities to understand the
interactive strategies of human reorientation.
Keywords: spatial reorientation; geometric module; roomsize effect; associative model; adaptive cue combination; probabilistic models.

Introduction
The spatial world provides many cues to where things are.
Because these cues usually converge, one way of thinking
about how they support navigation is Bayesian combination, using weights based on saliency, reliability and validity.
When there are large discrepancies between cues, perhaps resulting from encoding errors or forgetting, choices are made
between cues according to the same considerations (Cheng,
Huttenlocher, & Rieser, 2007; Huttenlocher, Hedges, & Duncan, 1991).
An alternative perspective is that spatial cues are modularly separable. Research on behavior when organisms are
disoriented and internally-generated spatial cues are not useful initially seemed to support modularity, because geometrical cues were used while potentially useful featural cues were
not (Cheng, 1986; Gallistel, 1990; Hermer & Spelke, 1994,
1996). While human adults do use featural cues, HermerVazquez, Spelke and Katsnelson (1999) argued that young
children and non-human species share a geometric module
for reorientation, later punctured by spatial language.
The modularity hypothesis has attracted much attention,
but it has become clear that it cannot account for many aspects of the expanding data set. One prominent problem is
the room-size effect. Geometry is more likely to be used
in small spaces and features are more likely to be used in
large spaces, for children (Learmonth, Newcombe, & Huttenlocher, 2001; Learmonth, Nadel, & Newcombe, 2002),
adults (Ratliff & Newcombe, 2008b), fish (Sovrano, Bisazza,
& Vallortigara, 2007), chicks (Chiandetti, Regolin, Sovrano,
& Vallortigara, 2007; Sovrano & Vallortigara, 2006; Vallortigara, Feruglio, & Sovrano, 2005), and pigeons (Kelly,
Spetch, & Heth, 1998). In addition, short-term experience

with the usefulness of a feature cue changes the behavior of
young children (Twyman, Friedman, & Spetch, 2007), human
adults (Ratliff & Newcombe, 2008a) and pigeons (Kelly &
Spetch, 2004). Further, rearing environment changes weighting of geometry and features, at least for convict fish (Brown,
Spetch, & Hurd, 2007) and mice (Twyman, Newcombe, &
Gould, 2013), although not chicks (Chiandetti & Vallortigara,
2008, 2010). Cheng (2008) suggested abandoning a modularity approach.
Non-modular approaches to the reorientation data have
been proposed; for an overview, see Cheng, Huttenlocher, and
Newcombe (2013). One computational approach is an associative model (Miller & Shettleworth, 2007; Miller, 2009). A
Bayesian alternative called the adaptive combination model
has been proposed (e.g. Newcombe & Huttenlocher, 2006)
but not yet computationally specified. The purpose of this
paper is to specify such a computational model, test it against
and cross-predict existing data, and compare it to alternatives.

Computational model
We assume that an agent (e.g. a person or an animal) is inside
a closed space (e.g. a room), has seen an object being hidden in one of a finite number of possible locations within that
space (e.g. one of the corners of a room), and is then disoriented within that space. We model the agent’s belief concerning the location of the target object t as jointly influenced by
the three cues G, D, and L, as illustrated in Figure 1.

W : world (not explicitly modeled).
G (geometry) is the geometric shape of the space, e.g. the
lengths of the walls, and the angles they form where they
meet. D (direction) assumes that the agent has oriented,
or polarized, toward a distinctive feature-bearing landmark,
such as a colored wall, and encodes the angular distance of the

2715

target object from the agent’s front when the agent is facing
that landmark. Note that purely associative reorientation—
commonly understood as locating a target based on its spatial coincidence with a landmark—is a special case of D in
which the angular distance between landmark and target is
zero. The directional effect could also be described allocentrically rather than egocentrically. L (language) is the ability
to use spatial language to assist in locating the target. These
cues are themselves derived in some way from the structure
of the world (W ), but our current work does not explicitly
model how world structure gives rise to these cues, and for
this reason that portion of the model is grayed out in the figure. We define C as the set of available cues C = {G, D, L}
and capture reorientation and selection of the target location
as probabilistic inference over possible target locations given
this combined set of cues. Using Bayes’ rule, we express the
posterior belief concerning target location t as:
p(t|C) ∝ p(C|t)p(t) = p(G, D, L|t)p(t)

(1)

Assuming initial ignorance about possible locations, i.e. a
uniform prior p(t), the posterior is proportional to the likelihood p(G, D, L|t). Since each cue contributes independently
to reorientation, we further decompose the likelihood by separating out the cues using this independence assumption:

p(G, D, L|t) =
∝

p(G|t)p(D|t)p(L|t)
(2)
f (t|G)p(G) f (t|D)p(D) f (t|L)p(L)

Thus, the overall likelihood p(G, D, L|t) depends on how
likely it is that the target t will be predicted by each cue
f (t|·), weighted by prior belief in each cue p(·). For all of our
present analyses, we assume priors on cues are uniform, although our framework makes it possible to encode prior preferences over cues. Thus what remains is to specify the cue
likelihood term f (t|·) for each cue.
For each cue, we represent its likelihood by a function that
expresses how likely the target is at each given location. This
function encodes the information that each cue provides about
target location, and includes a signal component and a noise
component. We specify a single noise parameter δ for all
cues, and this noise parameter diminishes with experience or
training. We use age as a proxy for experience. Thus for any
given cue with no a priori training, this model holds that children are more likely than adults to receive noisy information
from that cue, which is one reason children are more likely to
make incorrect choices concerning target location.
For the G cue, the likelihood function specifies a signal
component of 1 if that cue predicts a certain location i as
the target. For example, when reorienting in a rectangularly
shaped room to a target at one of the four corners, G has a
value of 1 on the target corner and on the corner diagonally
opposite it, because those are the two locations that are identical to the target location when considering only geometric
information. The likelihood also specifies a noise compo-

nent that scales inversely with age subject to a multiplicative
weighting parameter w:
{
1
(if G predicts i)
(3)
f (t = i|G) =
1
(otherwise)
δ = w·age
The likelihood of the D cue has an identical noise component but a different signal component. We assume that D has a
signal component that points only to the target object, but the
strength of this cue depends on the salience of the landmark
(e.g. the salience of a colored wall). This signal component
would be perfectly informative in a high-salience condition,
but uninformative in a low-salience condition. This dependence on salience is motivated by previous findings that a
small enclosure can degrade reorientation performance despite the presence of a landmark feature, especially in very
young children (Hermer & Spelke, 1996). We assume that
small room size reduces the salience of the landmark feature.
We formalize this interaction between salience and the D cue
using a probabilistic OR:
{
1 − (1 − s)(1 − δ) (if D predicts i)
f (t = i|D) =
δ
(otherwise)

(4)

Here s represents salience and can range from 0 (no
salience) to 1 (full salience). When s is 0, this likelihood function is entirely flat and uninformative. Here, the salience parameter s is assumed to be 0 in a small room (area no greater
than 24 square feet, motivated by previous work by Hermer
& Spelke, 1996), and 1 otherwise. Although we have made
this binary assumption for simplicity, future work can explore independent empirical measures of landmark salience
for rooms of different sizes in a systematic way.
The likelihood of the L cue takes a similar form, but
depends on the availability of spatial language rather than
salience:
{
1 − (1 − a(L))(1 − δ) (if L predicts i)
f (t = i|L) =
(5)
δ
(otherwise)
This cue points to the target and becomes available when
an agent is fluent and has access to spatial language, which is
determined by the function a(L). This function ranges from
0 (no access to spatial language) to 1 (full access). We assume a value of 0 (no access) for participants under the age
of 6, a value of 1 (full access) for those who are 6 years of
age or older and are not experimentally prevented from using
language, and a range of values between 0.5 and 1 for participants 6 years of age or older who are being experimentally
prevented from using language, for example through a concurrent verbal interference task. These assumptions are motivated by previous work suggesting that spatial language helps
children of age 6 but not younger in reorientation (HermerVazquez, 1997), and that verbal shadowing degrades reorientation performance in adults (Hermer-Vazquez, Spelke, &
Katsnelson, 1999).

Data
To assess our model, we used empirical data from several existing published sources. We chose these data sets to account
for the breadth of phenomena reported in the reorientation
literature and maintain analytical consistency across studies.
For example, we restricted our analysis to experimental conditions where the landmark is a wall. Table 1 summarizes the
empirical data relevant to our analyses and their theoretical
implications.

Model evaluation and results
We proceed in two steps. First, we fit our model using data
from existing studies and use it to predict studies from which
it was not derived. We show that our GDL model outperforms an existing associative model (Miller, 2009; Miller &
Shettleworth, 2007) in accounting for associative cue combination, i.e. when the target is spatially coincident with a
feature-bearing landmark. Next, we show that our model also
predicts non-associative cue combination, i.e. when the target
is at some distance from the landmark.

Associative cue combination
We first assess whether the GDL model accounts for associative cue combination. We begin by drawing on a representative data set that spans across age groups (Learmonth et al.,
2002). This set was used by Miller (2009), so we can directly
compare our model to Miller’s associative model.
The experimental procedures follow Learmonth et al.
(2002); we explain these briefly. All experiments were carried out in an enclosed rectangular room. The size of the room
differed across two conditions: large (8-×12-ft) and small (4×6-ft). In both cases, one of the shorter walls had a blue
curtain that served as a landmark (the “blue-wall condition”).
Figure 2a illustrates this experimental setup. The target was
placed at a corner that coincides with the blue wall for a given
trial. The four corners of the room were referred to as the C
(correct), R (rotationally identical or invariant), N (near) and
F (far) corners. Successful reorientation depends on associating the target with one corner of the blue wall.1 Three groups
1 Learmonth et al. (2002) also included a condition in which the
target was distant from the landmark, i.e. non-associative, but did
not report any significant difference in behavior between associative
and non-associative conditions. Therefore we focus on the associative condition here, although our result holds equally for the nonassociative case.

of children from 3 to 6 years of age participated in the reorientation task. In each trial, participants were shown the target location, disoriented and then asked to point to the target.
Figure 2b-c shows the average empirical choice probabilities
along with model fits.
We modeled these data using our cue combination (GDL)
model as follows. The G cue was encoded by a likelihood
function that has signals at the C and R corners and noise
at the remaining two corners. This captures the fact that the
C and R corners are geometrically identical or rotationally
invariant (Hermer & Spelke, 1996); thus geometry ambiguously predicts target location. The D cue has a signal at C
and noise elsewhere. This captures the fact that the target
coincides with the landmark blue wall. However, the signal
component for D is dependent on salience, which in this case
is assumed to be determined by room size. In the small room,
salience s = 0; in the large room, salience s = 1. For the L
cue, we assumed full access to spatial language (L(a) = 1) for
children 6 years of age and no access (L(a) = 0) otherwise.
The only free parameter in the model is w, which determines
how quickly noise reduces as a function of age; we fit this
parameter to the data through grid search between 0.01 and
1.0 in steps of 0.01.
We compared the choice probabilities estimated from our
GDL model to those from Miller’s associative model (2009) 2
and a baseline model that involves only the geometrical cue
with no cue combination. Figure 2b-c summarizes the results. In the large-room condition (Figure 2b), performance
is almost indistinguishable between the GDL (r2 = 0.98) and
Miller (r2 = 0.97) models, and both outperformed the baseline model (r2 = 0.40). This result is expected because in the
large room, the language cue L (which is absent from Miller’s
model) is redundant with the directional cue D (which is
present in Miller’s model as an associative cue), and both
cues correctly point to the target; thus both of these models have this critical information, and the geometric baseline
model lacks it. In the small-room condition (Figure 2c), both
Miller’s (r2 = 0.57) and baseline (r2 = 0.40) models perform
poorly in explaining the data, but our proposed model accounts for the choice pattern substantially better (r2 = 0.96).
In particular, Miller’s model predicts higher choice probability on the correct corner than other corners for all age
groups, hence it fails to predict the qualitative difference in

performance between age groups < 6 and = 6. On the other
hand, the geometry-only model fails to capture the superior
performance in age group 6 altogether. This is because neither model captures the presumed influence of language when
salience is weak in the small room. Our model, however,
does explicitly capture this interaction between language and
salience, and best explains these empirical findings that contrast reorientation performance across ages between large and
small enclosures.
To further assess our model, we used the parameters estimated from the previous experiment to predict data from a
separate study conducted with adults (Ratliff & Newcombe,
2008a).3 The specific paradigm we tested is consistent with
the blue-wall experiment described earlier: adults were disoriented in identically sized large and small rooms. However
in this study, one of the conditions involved verbal shadowing, intended to render language partially inaccessible during
reorientation (see also Hermer-Vazquez et al., 1999). Figure 3 (first column) presents data from Ratliff & Newcombe
(2008a). It can be seen that verbal shadowing appears to
somewhat reduce the rate of correct responding, and that this
reduction is (significantly) smaller in the large room than in
the small room. We interpret the greater resilience of correct
responding under verbal shadowing in the large room as resulting from the greater salience of the landmark in the large

room (supporting the D cue), despite the experimentallyinduced degradation of the L cue in both conditions. Figure 3
(columns 2-4) presents the response patterns predicted by the
same three models described above (we varied the availability of language a(L) in the L cue over the range 0.5 to 1 (in
steps of 0.1) to capture different degrees of language inaccessibility; the bar graphs for the GDL model show the average
prediction within that range). Our model again outperforms
(r2 = 0.94) the competing models by capturing the interaction
between salience (here, room size) and language, whereas the
competing models do not account for this interaction.
Taken together, these two sets of results suggest our cue
combination model accounts well for association-based cue
combination in reorientation.

Non-associative cue combination
We next assess whether our model also accounts for cue combination beyond association—a phenomenon that is not captured by previous computational models. In particular, we focus on directional cue combination as reported by Newcombe
et al. (2010) .
In this set of experiments, the reorientation task was conducted in an octagonal room. Similar to the previous experiments, one of the walls had a red curtain that served as a landmark. However in contrast with the previous experiments,
the target location did not coincide with any of the corners
covered by the landmark, but instead was one of the distant

corners as illustrated in Figure 4a (leftmost panel). In other
words, successful reorientation in this case would depend on
mapping from a distant landmark to a target, or direction. The
room was 75 square feet in area, which is close to the size
of the previous large rectangular room. Two of the corners
(GW) were geometrically identical to the correct corner (C).
One corner (GF) was both geometrically identical and coincides with the featured landmark. The remaining three corners were error corners (EW). Two groups of children (ages
3 and 5) participated in the experiment. Figure 4b (right 2
panels) shows the empirical choice probabilities, and model
estimates of them.
We used the GDL model to account for these empirical
data. Specifically, the G cue had signal components at all geometrically invariant corners (C,GF,GW and GW) and noise
δ elsewhere. The directional D cue had a signal component
at C and noise elsewhere. The L cue is uninformative in this
case because both age groups for the octagonal experiments
are below 6, which renders a flat likelihood. To allow for
a fully predictive (parameter-free) assessment, we used the
noise values for 3- and 5-year-olds from the blue-wall experiments, which are independent of the current analysis.
We compared our GDL model against two baseline models that incorporate either the directional cue alone, or the
geometrical cue alone, with no cue combination. Figure 4b
summarizes the predicted choice probabilities from all three
models. These results show that our GDL model (r2 = 0.87)
accounts for empirical data across two age groups better
than the direction- (r2 = 0.68) or geometry- (r2 = 0.32)
based model. The directional model cannot distinguish between geometrically identical corners and error corners, so it
over-predicts the overall erroneous choices. The geometrical
model cannot distinguish between the correct corner and ge-

ometrically confounded corners, so it under-predicts choices
on the target. In sum, this set of results suggests that children combine non-associative, directional information with
geometry in spatial reorientation, which extends beyond an
associative account and provides firmer evidence for a cuecombination view.

Conclusion
We have presented a probabilistic model of spatial reorientation based on cue combination. Our model accounts for human behavior better than existing models across different enclosure sizes and shapes, different age groups, and different
landmark configurations. Despite its simplicity, our model
suggests that reorientation is neither performed in an isolated
module nor purely association-based, hence moving beyond
that debate and helping to illuminate the richness of human
spatial strategies.
