these terms pick out professional social roles. Knobe,
Prasada, and Newman (2013) argue that one way to
determine whether a term expresses a DCC is to consider its
acceptability     under      true-modification.  By      ‘true-
modification’ we mean sentences of the form of (3), i.e., in
which the predicate is modified by true:
        (3) Jack is a true scientist.
The basic idea is that, in this kind of linguistic
construction, the true-modifier operates on the normative
dimension. Scientist is a paradigmatic DCC, hence (3)
seems perfectly acceptable. For terms that arguably have
either no normative dimension or no default value on it,
true-modifications will seem less acceptable, as in (4):            Figure 1: Acceptability-ratings for true-modifications of 18

After all, that someone is a really an efficient or skillful

more important for satisfying the normative dimension of
DCCs than simply being able to fulfill that function.

`abstract values' and `normative dimensions', there is
nothing mysterious about why, given the basic function of
categorization and certain basic properties of the flexibility of
human behavior, many of our social role concepts should
include a dimension that encodes the relevant commitments.
Without this dimension, our predictions regarding the
behavior of others would be substantially impoverished.
    This account of the explanatory adequacy of our theory of
DCCs explains why there are weak and strong DCCs. In our
view, DCCs capture certain aspects of the basic structure of
the perceived human social world, including sets of co-
occurring features. Now it is widely believed---often
correctly---that membership in some social roles requires a
greater degree of commitment and effort than membership in
others. Cognitive Economy and Perceive World Structure
entail that social role concepts should trace these differences.
If we compare the weak (e.g., doorman) and strong DCCs
(e.g., scientist), we can easily see that their orderings (see
Figure 1 above) reflects a common cultural valuation along
those lines.
                         Conclusion
We have seen that various social role concepts are dual
character concepts (DCCs), and others are either weak or can
be easily coerced into DCCs. We defended an account of the
normative dimension of DCCs according to which this
dimension represents commitments to fulfill the idealized
function of a certain social role. We also showed that this
dimension is central to their conceptual structure.
Judgments involving social role concepts such as artist,
scientist and friend are an essential part of social cognition,
hence we expect that our account of the content of DCCs
