In Experiment 1, we investigated whether 19-month-olds
can learn effectively when their play is facilitated by an
adult experimenter. Through such collaborative play, the
toddlers observed both experimenter-generated and self-
generated evidence.
Method
Participants Forty English-speaking toddlers (20 boys)
with a mean age of 19.0 months (range = 17.7 to 20.0
months) were tested. All were recruited from Berkeley,
California, and its surrounding communities. 6 additional
toddlers were tested but excluded due to refusal to make a
choice at test (N=2), and parental interference (N=4). Each
toddler was assigned to a Shape or a Color condition.
Materials Four categories of toy machines were used in this
experiment, with two identical machines in each category.
The categories differed in shape and color, i.e. machines in
Category 1 were blue and rectangular; machines in Category
2 were red and triangular; machines in Category 3 were

   When the toddler lost interest in the first machine, the
experimenter pointed to the other identical machine and
said, “I have another one over here! Let’s see what this one
does.” The second machine was then retrieved from the box,
and the toddler was again free to play with this machine for
as long as he/she wants. The experimenter only activated the
second machine if the toddler did not initiate play with it.
   When the toddler lost interest in the second machine, the
experimenter then drew his/her attention to the remaining
boxes, and said, “Let’s see what I have in those boxes over
there!” The first set of machines and block were returned to
their box, and put away. This procedure was repeated with
the other two sets of machines, activating them with the
shape-match or color-match block available in each box.
After the toddler had played with all three categories of
