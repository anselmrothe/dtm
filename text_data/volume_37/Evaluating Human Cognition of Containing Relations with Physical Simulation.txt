   Containers are ubiquitous in daily life. By container, we con-

   as bowls, bottles, baskets, trash cans, refrigerators, etc. In this
   paper, we are interested in following questions: What is a con-
   tainer? Will an object contain another object? How many
   objects will a container hold? We study those problems by
   evaluating human cognition of containers and containing rela-

psychology. Some works (Goldman & Sripada, 2005) ex-
amined the simulation approach and the theorizing approach
for determining the compatibility between emotions and ex-
isting evidence. Some neuroscience research is quite related
to simulationist ideas (Chaminade, Meary, Orliaguet, & De-
cety, 2001; Gallese & Goldman, 1998; Jeannerod, 2001).
(Hamrick, Battaglia, & Tenenbaum, 2011; Battaglia et al.,
2013) studied the intuitive physics engine as a model to rea-
son stability of a tower built by blocks. They showed the sim-
ulation model matched human perceptions. Benefiting from
game engines, such as PhysX, Bullet and Unity3D, physical
simulation is widely available for game designers as an off-
the-shelf component (Kaufmann & Meyer, 2008).
