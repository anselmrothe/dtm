B2, C2, A3, B3, C3, A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3.
In this sequence, a new occurrence of A1 is less likely to
result in the recollection of A2 and A3 because they were
not strongly associated during the first presentation.
  Another possibility is that, when A1 is repeated in a
blocked sequence the commonalities between all A items
(A1, A2, and A3 in this example) that were extracted and
encoded during the first study of these items will be
selectively, and more quickly, reemphasized. Interleaved
study, on the other hand, does not allow for the reactivation
of commonalities initially identified because learners are
unlikely to have noticed communalities between items of
the same category during initial study.
  In effect, through a process of iterative recollection of
previous items (Hintzman, 2010; Ross, 1984; Ross, Perkins,
& Tenpenny, 1990), or rapid reactivation of common
properties when repetitions are presented, learners in a
blocked study sequence recollect more of the items in each
category during a second review, contributing to more
effective learning in that sequence of study.
   In this paper we look at the influence of item repetition
on blocked and interleaved study across three experiments.
We predict that when item repetition is present, blocked
study will result in higher performance during the test phase
due to better encoding of the entire category.
