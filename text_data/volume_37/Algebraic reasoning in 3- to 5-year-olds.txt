children’s difficulty with reasoning about the effects of
transformation is specific to a change of one individual
object. Children’s performance on ‘-3+1’ trial also
addresses the question of whether their difficulty with the ‘-
A+A’ trial in the visible-set experiment can be explained by
the ‘two-step’ processing account or the ‘last-action’
heuristic account.

   In addition to trials that required children to judge
whether there were more elements, children were given
