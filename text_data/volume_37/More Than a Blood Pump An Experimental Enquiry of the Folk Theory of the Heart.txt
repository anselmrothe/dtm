    Experiment 4: How does the Chinese Heart

   As alluded to earlier, the conventionalized heart-                   To facilitate interpretation, we analyzed data for the two

is, the literal meanings of these expressions are tantamount
to messages advocating the mental capacities of the heart.
Thus, people living in these linguistic communities are
surrounded by prima facie endorsements of cardiopsychism.
This creates an ideal milieu for cardiopsychism to
insidiously implant itself firmly in people’s belief system.
As research on the illusory truth effect has shown, simply
exposing people to a claim could increase the perceived
truth of this claim (e.g. Hawkins & Hoch, 1992). This is the
case even when the claim was explicitly flagged as false
initially (e.g. Skurnik, Yoon, Park, & Schwarz, 2005).
   If the linguistic input did contribute to the perpetuation of
cardiopsychism, then the specifics of the cardiopsychism                   Figure 3: Possibility ratings for different conditions.

Experiment 5: Would You Accept a Pig Heart?
   The shortage of donated organs has prompted scientific
investigation into the possibility of xenotransplantation, i.e.
transplanting non-human, usually pig, organs to humans
(McLean & Williamson, 2005). A question with policy
implication is whether cardiopsychism may lead to stronger
resistance toward xenotransplantation of the heart than other
organs. We addressed this question in the present study.

States completed an online study. Participants were assigned               Figure 4: Premium for transplants of human origin.
