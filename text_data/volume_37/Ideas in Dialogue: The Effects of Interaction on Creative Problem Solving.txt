 the dialogue progresses, they cause minimal disruption to the
 ‘flow’ of the conversation.
    The DiET chat tool is a custom built Java application, con-
 sisting of two main components: the server console and the
 user interface. The server time-stamps and stores each key
 press, and acts as an intermediary between what participants
 type and what they see. Each turn is passed to the server, from
 where it is relayed to the other participants.
 User interface The user interface is designed to look and
 feel like common instant messaging applications (see Fig-
 ure 1). It consists of a display split into two windows, with
 a status bar between them. The ongoing dialogue, consisting
 of both the nickname of the contributor and their transmitted
 text, is shown in the upper window. In the lower window, par-
 ticipants can type and revise their contributions, before send-
 ing them to their co-participants. All key presses are time-
 stamped and stored by the server. The status bar, between the
 upper and lower windows, shows whether any participants are
 actively typing.                                                        Figure 1: The instructions window and DiET chat window
