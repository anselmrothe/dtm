behavior.
   In relation to other types of underground maps, the LUD
does not introduce a distinct kind of semiotic process, but
specializes the semiotic process to signify mainly in terms
of connectivity. In this sense, the LUD serves as an example
of meaning as an action-oriented process.
   The utilization of the LUD by an Underground user can
be understood as a meaning process S-O-I in which O is a
problem space. As this is an iconic process, O is dependent
of the intrinsic qualities of S, so that changes in S generate
transformations in O. Beck’s design innovations (changes in
S) transform the problem space (O), participating in cogniti-
ve niche construction. In this sense, iconic meaning (more
than indexicality or symbolicity) is at the core of cognitive
niche construction. This approach suggests a new philo-
sophical treatment of the relation between problem space,
cognitive niche construction and meaning processes.
