Materials
The problems were printed in booklets. The front page
displayed the two training problems and provided the
matching strategy solution for each of them. The following
instructions were given on the upper-side of the page: “You
will find an arithmetic problem on every page of this
booklet. We ask you to take the time to thoroughly read the
problems: there is no time constraint. Please write down
every operation you do in order to reach a solution. Just
below, you will find two training problems, followed by
their respective solutions. Every other problem in this
booklet can be solved using the same principle, with only
one operation.”
   Each test problem page was divided in three parts: the
problem itself was presented on the upper-left side of the
page, the response area was on the upper-right side of the
page, and an area that could be used as a draft was on the
bottom of every test page. These test pages were always
presented on the right side of the booklets, while the two
training problems with their solution with the matching
strategy were displayed on each left page, in sight during
the test phase as a reminder.

   Overall, semantic encoding of the problems had a strong
impact on transfer. Indeed, it is so robust that even with the
example problem repeatedly shown to the participants with
a solving strategy in one operation that leads to the solution,
and even when the instructions explicitly state that the same
solution in one operation applied to all the problems,
participants tended to use the longer three-step strategy
when the quantities involved promoted a cardinal encoding.
In contrast, more of them used the one-step strategy when
the quantities involved promoted an ordinal encoding. This
holds true both when a literal application of the taught
algorithm is sufficient (H1) and when this taught algorithm
has to be adapted (H2).
Analysis of negative transfer
The second part of our analysis involved the distribution of
errors across the experimental conditions. We created the
following typology for the strategies used by participants:
   - (i) correct operator with the wrong operands (calculating
the whole when the question is about the part, or vice
versa), classified as “inverted operands only”;
   - (ii) correct operands with the wrong operator (addition          Figure 3: Distribution of the different type of errors across
