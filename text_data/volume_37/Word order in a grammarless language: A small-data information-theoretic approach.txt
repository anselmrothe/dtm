Abstract
David Gil has argued that Riau Indonesian (Sumatra.
Indonesia) has no syntax, or at least not much. This
controversial analysis undermines all current models of
grammar, especially those describing acquisition and on-line
processing. To test the strength of this analysis, we computed
the information gain holding between unigram and bigram
models of regular and randomized samples of English and
Riau Indonesian. English samples were included as a
relatively syntax-heavy baseline. We then correlated
information gain values with language (English vs. Riau
Indonesian), text type (original vs. randomized), and their
interaction within a linear mixed-effects regression. The
results suggest (a) that English and Riau Indonesian have the
same amount of bigram informativity and (b) that
randomization eliminates this effect in both languages. These
findings do not support Gil’s syntax-free analysis; rather, they
point to some kind of productive constraints on Riau
Indonesian word order.
Keywords: Indonesian; word classes; n-gram models;
information gain; entropy.

Introduction
Most theories of grammar posit a layer of categorization
that discriminates words into different functional types, or
word classes.1 These word classes define the combinatorial
possibilities of words, and so serve a central function within
the syntax of any given language. Examples of common
word classes include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and
adpositions. The widespread recurrence of these classes
cross-linguistically has led some researchers to argue for
their either being cognitively basic or universally available
as part of the genetically endowed human linguistic
apparatus. Over the past few decades, however, a growing
body of evidence from languages across the globe has come
to challenge the basic or universal status of even the most
common word classes, including nouns and verbs (cf.
Rijkhoff & van Lier, 2013). The most radical argument to
emerge from this line of research comes from David Gil and
his analysis of Riau Indonesian (RI), a colloquial variety of
Bahasa Indonesian (BI) spoken on the central-eastern coast
of Sumatra.
According to Gil (1994; 2013), RI essentially lacks any
grammatically relevant word classes. In itself, this claim is
1

I use the term ‘functional’ in its broadest sense to refer to
both the syntactic and semantic properties of words.

not so shocking, as similar arguments have been made for
other languages. For example, Hengeveld (2013) points out
the difficulty of assigning Samoan words to default word
classes. In Samoan, most words can occur in any of the
morphosyntactic frames defining predication, reference, and
modification. This phenomenon has been widely discussed
as a form of lexical flexibility (van Lier & Rijkhoff, 2013).
But Gil goes further, arguing that RI has largely
unconstrained word order and no inflectional morphology;
that is, he argues that RI has no syntax. This last point
sharply differentiates RI from languages like Samoan, in
that the latter indeed provides systematic, grammatically
encoded cues for reconstructing meaning: interpretation of a
word’s functional-semantic contribution to the sentence is
guided by its morphosyntactic positioning. By contrast,
according to Gil, RI has no set of syntactic constructions to
which regular interpretations could be linked.
The existence of a language like RI contradicts the most
basic assumptions underlying most (if not all) established
theories of grammar, especially in the domains of
processing and acquisition. For example, linguists generally
assume that all humans acquire their respective native
language(s) by means of the same perceptual-cognitive
system. In one formulation, this apparatus constitutes a
genetically pre-specified Language Acquisition Device
(LAD) which mediates the interaction between linguistic
experience and the inborn set of grammatical categories and
rules known as Universal Grammar (UG). Other
formulations emphasize the role of domain-general (i.e., not
purely linguistic) statistical learning mechanisms during
language acquisition. According to these theories, all
humans bring the same simple learning algorithms to bear
on the problem of parsing input sequences (e.g., the
‘chunking’ of sequences with high internal transitional
association strengths). Under either theory, knowledge of
word sequences, either in the form of innate constraints
within UG or statistical generalizations over the likelihood
of candidate word combinations, stands at the heart of
linguistic competence. But how could a language like RI,
which lacks reliable constraints on word order, arise from –
or be acquired by – a cognitive system that depends so
heavily on sequence-driven (i.e., syntactic) generalizations?.
In the next section, we describe the grammatical analysis
of RI as developed by David Gil over the past two decades.
We then introduce a corpus methodology capable of
measuring differences in the regularity of local syntactic

1314

structure between two languages on the basis of extremely
small samples (n < 3000 words). Next, we apply this
comparative method to naturalistic data from RI and English
and present the results. Finally, we discuss these results with
reference to usage-based theories of language structure.

Riau Indonesian: A language without (much)
grammar
Like other Austronesian languages of western Indonesia, RI
is close to the ideal isolating language: its words exhibit
few, if any, inflectional variants. RI does make limited use
of a sparse and functionally heterogeneous set of affixes
(e.g., the common Indonesian voice-altering prefixes N- and
di-) and some other morphological processes (e.g.,
reduplication, compounding; Gil, 2008). However, these
processes are never inflectional in RI, nor are they ever
obligatory. Rather, they represent ‘optional semantic
embellishments’ (Gil, 2008: 127).
Unlike other closely related Austronesian languages, RI
also closely approximates a hypothetical monocategorial
language (Gil, 2008). Monocategoriality is related to the
notion of lexical flexibility introduced earlier, though it
differs in one crucial respect. In highly flexible languages,
‘precategorial’ words are combined with morphosyntactic
templates to derive specifically referential, predicative, or
modificational interpretations for each item (Hengeveld &
Rijkhoff, 2005). Monocategorial languages, on the other
hand, offer no such links between semantic interpretation
and morphosyntactic form. Words in these languages are
therefore not ‘flexible’ in the sense that they can appear in a
number of contrastive syntactic functions; they are
‘monocategorial’ in the sense that they are at all times
equivalent in ontological and syntactic status. They are in
principle free to occur in any syntagmatic combination with
any interpretation (provided a few principled exceptions).
To be clear, Gil does not argue that RI lacks word order
altogether. In fact, he proposes one syntactic and several
competing extra-syntactic forces to account for what he sees
as apparent syntactically-driven constraints on order (Gil,
2005). Syntactically, he argues that RI has a vanishingly
small set of functionally heterogeneous particles. These
particles must precede the constituent with which they
combine. However, these forms are few in number and may
precede (as well as follow) any other word form (that is,
they are collocationally unrestricted). Apart from syntax, Gil
proposes several soft constraints related to functional
interpretations and discourse-pragmatics. Thus, conceptual
heads tend to precede their modifiers, topical and discourseold information tends to surface earlier within 'clauses'
(though he does not recognize any qualitative difference
between individual words and clauses), and so on. However,
these principles are only optionally applied. Furthermore, as
with the particles, they do not dictate the choice of lexical
item: any word may serve any syntactic and thematic
function in any position relative to any other word. Finally,
these tendencies have been implicated within more rigid
syntactic systems, as well, only there they are treated as

parameters governing choices of constructional alternatives
(e.g., the dative alternation; Arnold, Wasow, Lonsongco, &
Ginstrom, 2000). Therefore, their presence in RI does not
rule out the possibility that they are linked directly to
syntactic representations.
To the extent that RI word order is unconstrained (with
respect to surface tokens), local sequences of words should
approach near-random distribution. For any given pairing of
words (w1, w2), we should find an equal probability of
observing the order w1+w2 as the alternative w2+w1. In other
words, knowledge of the preceding word should not help
much in guessing the word to follow. We can refer to this
situation as one of minimal bigram informativity. This
would be the case for purely randomly distributed strings of
words, and so can be considered a theoretical lower-bound
for bigram structure. Given Gil's account of the presence of
at least some ordering effects, we expect RI to exceed this
lower-bound. However, based on Gil's claims of lexical
flexibility at both the syntactic and thematic levels of
structure, we can predict that RI should come closer to the
minimal threshold than a language like English, which is
well known to exhibit robust syntactic constraints on word
order. In the next section, we describe an informationtheoretic measure known as information gain, which can be
used to estimate the degree of bigram informativity of a
sample text, relative to the baseline probabilities of words.
Using this measure, we can compare RI with English to
determine just how flexible RI word order is.

Information gain
Information gain is calculated in three stages. First, a
unigram model and a bigram model are estimated on the
basis of a training text (e.g., some connected subset of a
corpus of writing or transcribed speech). Next, an
information-theoretic measure known as cross entropy is
computed for each model to assess the fit of the trained
model for an unseen test sample. The cross entropy
represents the average number of bits needed to code an
event from one distribution as if it belonged to a different
distribution. Applying this to the problem of model fit, we
can measure the number of bits needed to code a target
event according to the distribution predicted by a model
trained on part of a text (the training sample) when that
event actually belongs to the distribution instantiated by the
remainder of that text (the test sample). The resulting value
measures the incompatibility of the expectations of the
model with the observed properties of the test sample.
Cross entropy is expressed formally as a variation of
Shannon’s entropy (Shannon, 1948). Shannon’s entropy
represents the average uncertainty of observing an event
which belongs to a given probability distribution. It is
expressed as the statistical expectation of the minus-log
probability of events in some distribution. Cross entropy, on
the other hand, is expressed as the negative sum of the
probabilities of events within some distribution P times the
log probabilities of those events within a comparison
distribution Q. The uncertainty associated with any event e

1315

in Q is weighted by its probability in P with the effect that
cross entropy H(P, Q) increases as P and Q diverge. The
equation is presented as Eq. 1 below.
H,  = −



  log   

(1)

In the present context, Q represents the probabilities as
estimated on the basis of the trained model, P represents the
probability distribution observed within the test sample, and
x represents a target event (i.e., the occurrence of a
particular word type). P(x) and Q(x) represent the
probabilities of event x as defined within the respective
distributions. As mentioned earlier, H(P, Q) increases as the
shape of probability distribution Q diverges from that of P.
High cross-entropy values thus reflect a poor fit of Q as a
model of P. Conversely, H(P, Q) approaches H(P) as the
probabilities of events within Q approximate the associated
probabilities within P.
To calculate IG, we need only subtract the bigram cross
entropy from the unigram cross entropy (the models must be
trained and tested on the same texts). The resulting value
reflects the compression rate in bits attributable to
knowledge of the immediately preceding word. IG is
positive by definition (unigram models necessarily have
higher entropies than the corresponding bigram models).
IG can be used to compare the contribution of bigrams to
models of different languages, a task which is not entirely
straightforward. For instance, languages might differ in their
baseline unigram entropies (and bigram entropies for that
matter) for any number of reasons (e.g., as a function of
morphological complexity of words). IG counters this
difficulty by relativizing the performance of the bigram
model to that of the unigram baseline.
Another useful feature of IG is that it can be applied to
relatively small text samples, where all comparison models
are trained on samples of the same size. This property is
critical considering that the RI corpus published by Gil and
colleagues contains only 2,700 words, well below what is
typically needed to draw reliable statistical inferences.
One might argue that bigram models trained on such
small samples will always perform remarkably poorly.
However, the goal of this analysis is not to create an optimal
model, but to test to what extent bigram knowledge
improves classification in RI and English. And yet the
magnitude of this increase in informativity naturally
depends on model performance. Therefore, comparing IG
estimates for different samples requires that we take careful
steps to ensure the comparability of our samples and
interpretability of our results. First, we must match all
samples for size (larger samples will ceteris paribus yield
more accurate models). Second, we must establish a
common baseline against which the IG increase can be
assessed. One way to obtain a common baseline is to derive
the corresponding minimal informativity distribution for

each text (i.e., by randomizing the texts). IG can then be
computed for the randomized and non-randomized versions
for each sample, and scaling up, for each language.
Comparing the IG of a sample against it corresponding
minimal (randomized) IG tells us how much information is
contained in the bigram word order of our samples above
and beyond what would be contributed by chance for that
same sample. In this way, IG values observed for different
samples can be anchored to a common lower bound, and so
are rendered comparable in magnitude.
Following Gil's analysis, we should expect that the IG
value for an RI text should approximate that of the
corresponding randomized text. Furthermore, the difference
between the IG values for randomized and non-randomized
samples should be smaller for RI than for English, if only
because English is assumed to have a much less fluid
lexicon and much more rigid constraints on word ordering.
We dub this set of predictions the Variable Order
Hypothesis to reflect the fact that word order in RI –
irrespective of functional interpretation – allows for more
variability than English. If no such difference were to be
found between RI and English, then we can conclude that
the apparent syntactic structure of RI introduced but rejected
by Gil (1994; 2005) may in fact play a much more serious
role in structuring RI speech. We dub this alternative the
Regular Order Hypothesis to indicate that under this
scenario, words in RI tend to be placed into regular patterns
of syntagmatic association.

Experiment: IG in RI and English
We test the above hypotheses with respect to surface
(unstemmed) n-grams in RI and English. We apply the logic
of IG as formulated above to size-matched samples of RI
and English transcribed speech. To further compensate for
the size of the corpora under investigation, we introduce a
bootstrapping procedure designed to maximize the
reliability of small-sample IG estimates. We then model the
resulting IG estimates as a function of language (RI vs.
English) and text type (original vs. randomized) using linear
mixed-effects regression.

Data
The data for RI were taken from Gil’s corpus as published in
four text files on the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology Jakarta Field Station website2. Each file
contains a stretch of transcribed naturalistic face-to-face
interactions, including the telling of stories and extended
riddles. The transcriptions have been broken into lines, and
each line is annotated for the following set of
representational dimensions: orthography, phonetic form,
morphological parse, and morpheme-by-morpheme English
gloss. Based on the orthographic tier, the RI corpus
comprises 2,727 words (unintelligible speech, marked with
sequences of ‘x’, was removed prior to the analysis).

data

All four recordings were taken from the same native
speaker, making the corpus less than ideal for purposes of
generalization. However, given the strength of Gil’s claims,
it is not clear how the idiosyncratic behavior of a single
individual could result in the appearance of bigram structure
when the underlying grammar remains as free and
underspecified as the system described above.
For the purposes of this analysis, the four individual files
were combined into a single text. This means that the corpus
is multiply discontinuous as there are three unauthentic
junctures. This heterogeneity of content could be
problematic for the generation of n-gram models. For
instance, it might be that the training sample (randomly
selected) comprises text from three of the four text files,
while the test sample comes from the fourth. Differences in
topic, register, and genre, among others, might lead such a
model to underperform in the classification of the unseen
text given the over- or under-representation of certain
distributionally biased unigrams or bigrams. As it turns out,
however, these issues are not all that serious for this
particular corpus considering the goals of this study. First,
all four of the texts are more or less closely related in terms
of register (informal speech) and genre (story telling vs.
riddles). Therefore, we should not expect the files to differ
substantially in their basic structural properties because of
these discourse-level features. Second, as mentioned above,
the four files were all collected from the same speaker.
While undoubtedly harmful for generalization to the whole
population, this fact actually works to solve the problem of
discontinuity. Because we are not dealing with different
speakers, the concatenation of these four files can be
considered a proxy for the evolution of topics across
extended conversation. Finally, even if the discontinuities
present in the collapsed corpus did lead to artificially high
cross entropies for the individual models, this would only
bias the results in favor of the monocategorial analysis, and
so serve to increase the conservativeness of the estimates.
In addition to the RI data, we extracted 19 English
comparison samples. All English data were sampled from
the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (Du
Bois, Chafe, Meyer, Thompson, Englebretson, & Martey,
2000-2005), which contains approximately 249,000 words
of transcribed spoken English from 60 different naturalistic
face-to-face interactions. Each sample was matched to
length of the RI corpus. Full files with word counts between
2500 and 3000 words were taken whole. There were twelve
such files. The remaining seven samples consist of the first
2750 words of seven files (respectively), which were
selected randomly from among those having length greater
than 3000 words.
The reasoning behind selecting exactly 19 comparison
samples is that a difference in behavior of the one RI text
out of twenty total texts would mirror the 5% α-threshold
commonly adopted for significance testing. In this way, we
guard against the possibility that non-representative
idiosyncrasies of individual English files could lead to
spurious results. This is especially important, given that the

English samples represent diverse genres, ranging from
intimate conversations to evangelical sermons. They
therefore vary along a number of dimensions, including
formality, mono-/dialogicality, and the total number of
speakers and/or other justified conversational participants.

Procedure
We generated IG estimates for randomized and nonrandomized versions of each of the 20 samples. This
required several steps. First, we created a randomized
version of each sample by scrambling the words contained
therein at the level of the complete text. In so doing, we
eliminated (a) any non-random, semantically motivated
proximity effects and (b) any principled ordering of
words/constituents. This process left us with a total of 20
randomized texts (19 English, 1 RI) and 20 non-randomized
texts (19 English, 1 RI).
Next, we estimated the IG values for all 40 samples
(random and non-random). In order to maximize the
representativeness of the IG value, we calculated ten cross
entropies for each sample by using ten-fold leave-one-out
cross-validation. All models were trained using the n-gram
model estimator from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
module for Python (cf. Bird, Klein, & Loper, 2009) with
Lidstone probability smoothing (γ = 0.2) to account for the
existence of unigram/bigram types not observed in the
sample. This process yielded 400 unigram cross entropy
estimates (10 estimates per 40 samples; 200 random and
200 original). We then repeated these steps, substituting
bigram models (with unigram backoffs), to generate a total
of 800 n-gram cross entropy estimates. Following the
procedure outlined above, we subtracted each bigram cross
entropy from its associated unigram cross entropy, creating
a total of 400 IG estimates (380 English, 20 RI). These
estimates serve as the dependent variable in the regression
analysis, discussed below.
Finally we computed the type-token ratios for each
sample. We calculated these values on the basis of surface
forms (i.e., we did not apply any stemming in my estimation
of the number of types) by dividing the size of the unique
set of lexical forms by the overall size of the sample.

Results
To evaluate the hypotheses laid out above, we computed a
linear mixed effects model with IG estimate as dependent
variable, language (RI vs. English), text type (original or
randomized), and type-token ratio as fixed effects, and
filename as a random effect. In order to test the Variable
Order Hypothesis, language and text type were allowed to
interact as an additional fixed effect. All possible effects
were included in the initial model. Non-significant
contributors to the model were removed through a
hierarchical backward elimination of factors: the predictor
with the largest non-significant p-value (α = 0.05) was
eliminated so long as it did not participate in any higher
order interaction. This process continued until only

1317

Information Gain (bits)

significant predictors or predictors participating in
significant higher-order effects remained.
Only type-token ratio (F(1, 18) = 20.81; p < .0001) and
text type (original vs. random; F(1, 378.68) = 2739.73; p <
.0001) emerged as significant predictors. Importantly, no
significant interaction was observed between language and
text type. Further, no significant main effect was observed
for language after removing the interaction of language and
text type.

As shown in Figure 1, TTR correlated negatively with IG
(β=-1.84, s.e.=.4). Therefore, as expected, models based on
more lexically diverse samples (i.e., samples with higher
TTR values) tended to benefit less from knowledge of the
previous word. This term was only included in the model as
a control, and so will not be considered further.

higher than those from randomized texts. Crucially, this
relationship holds for both English and RI.

Discussion
The analysis did not reveal any interaction between
language and text type. Therefore, the Variable Order
Hypothesis was not supported: RI and English exhibit
equivalent preferences for ordering of word pairs. Notice
that, given our design, this interaction between language and
text randomization should have been the only way for
language to impact IG scores in this model. The reasoning is
this: randomization should have the same effect on all
samples (so long as sample size and TTR have been
controlled for). A main effect of language, however, would
mean that both non-randomized and randomized IG values
were consistently higher for one of the two language groups.
Such a finding would suggest either that our measure is
sensitive to properties of the samples beyond those included
in our design or that our randomization strategy left unequal
residues of non-random sequencing within the samples.
We observed a significant effect of text type, as predicted
by the Regular Order Hypothesis. The advantage in IG
boosting effects found for bigram models of nonrandomized texts in English can be attributed to generalized
syntactic constraints. Should we impute the same source to
the effect observed for RI? While the answer to this question
must for several reasons remain tentative, the fact that
bigram sequencing was identically informative requires
explanation. Gil’s monocategorial analysis could either
attribute this effect to the small class of particles described
above or else rely exclusively on semantic and pragmatic
regularity. The former case would only offer a compelling
counter if the internal speciation of the particle class was on
par with that of English word classes generally (i.e., to
admit a the existence of highly differentiated word classes in
RI). The latter case would suggest that preferences on the
combination of certain semantic types within certain
pragmatic contexts translate into particular sequencing of
the words instantiating those types. This contingency
between meaning and form would be indistinguishable from
that posited of the fundamental syntactic constituent of
Construction Grammar (and other usage-based theories),
namely the construction (see Goldberg, 1995). In either
case, explaining these results would push the
monocategorial analysis ever closer to the more traditional
syntactic accounts of word order.

Conclusions

Text type

Figure 2: Main effect of text type (was the text
randomized or not) on information gain values
Above and beyond the effect of type-token ratio, the
regression returned a main effect of text randomization (β=.62, s.e.=.01). Figure 2 shows that, overall, IG scores from
properly ordered (original) texts are approximately 0.7 bits

Previous studies have argued that RI lacks generalized word
classes or syntactic constraints on word order. This analysis
constitutes an important departure from our generally
accepted understanding of the human language faculty. The
present study showed that if this analysis is correct, then it is
of little practical relevance to RI speech. An examination of
surface- derived bigram models of RI and English speech
revealed that these languages show an indistinguishable
benefit (IG increase) over unigram models trained on and

1318

applied to identical samples. English word order is largely
syntactically determined, raising the question of whether
this similarity in surface structure can be attributed to the
same (syntactic) source for RI. On the one hand, we see that
RI behaves as if it were syntactically constrained (in
comparison with English), and we know that closely related
varieties of Indonesian and Malay exhibit something like
‘traditional’ syntax (Sneddon, 1996). On the other hand, we
know that word order is co-determined by several other
factors, including prosodic, segmental, semantic, and
pragmatic variables. Further evidence is needed to tease this
network of effects apart. However, these factors have
themselves been implicated in the grammaticalization
process whereby syntactic forms emerge out of local
contingency of form and meaning. It is therefore unclear
whether these additional factors can ever be fully
disentangled from syntax in the diachrony of a language,
much less in the synchrony. Indeed, many frameworks argue
for these parameters being directly encoded in syntactic
representations (e.g., Goldberg, 1995).
Whatever the explanation, the degree of structure
observed here suggests the presence of pervasive functional
grouping in RI. Depending on the quantity and
distinctiveness of these groups, and of course their
diachronic depth, RI might present a case of intermediate
grammaticalization of syntactic structures, whereby
probabilistic biases have begun to crystallize into
constituent order constraints. On the other hand, this
apparent structure might simply be the product of
simplification via widespread second language acquisition
(McWhorter, 2006). In this scenario, lower level structural
features like the co-occurrence probabilities examined here
might have persisted while overt morphosyntax wore away.
In either case, Gil’s monocategorial analysis does not appear
capable of eluding the specter of grammar.
On another level, this finding provides a more reasonable
solution to the underspecification problem faced by speakers
of a language like RI. Mired in ambiguity, they appear to
have adopted methods to structure their utterances in
consistent, conventionalized ways. As more richly annotated
corpora become available, we can begin to examine whether
these
conventionalized
orderings
correlate
with
conventionalized interpretations. Based on Gil (2005), we
should expect that, indeed, particular orderings impose at
least the tendency for particular interpretations.
Methodologically, this study has demonstrated that even
small corpora of understudied languages can provide for
relatively rich analyses of probabilistic structure.
Particularly, the relativization vis-à-vis (1) the English to
Riau sample ratio and (2) the unigram-bigram differential
ensured that comparisons could be established on the basis
of a normalized baseline. Without this additional layer, it
would be difficult to determine what magnitude of IG score
should be treated as indicating a meaningful difference in
amount of structure.
