positive integers (1 to 9, inclusive) were greater or less than
5, a replication of the classic SNARC paradigm (Dehaene et
al, 1993). Each trial began with a fixation cross in the center
of a computer monitor, replaced after 1000ms by an Arabic
numeral between 1 and 9 (excluding 5). Participants had up
to 3000ms to respond by pressing one of two buttons on a
serial response box: the leftmost button with their left index
finger or the rightmost button with their right index finger.
Participants completed two blocks, each of which began
with eight practice trials (one for each numeral) followed by
eighty experimental trials (ten for each numeral); trial order
was randomized within blocks. Critically, we manipulated,
between blocks, the mapping between responses (greater vs.
less than 5) and spatial location (left vs right). Thus, e.g., in
response to numbers less than five, participants had to
respond on the left in one block and on the right in the other.
Block order was counterbalanced between subjects. If a
participant had a canonical left-to-right mental number-line,
