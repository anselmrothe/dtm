   In the literature on behavioral game theory, there is a
natural tendency to analyze mostly the choices made by
players at different turns of the game, thereby ignoring the
data on how much time they have taken to make that choice,
namely, the ‘response time’ data. Rubinstein (2014) does
argue for the importance of response times and takes that
data into account while discussing a typology of players in
different games. Also, he discusses typologies that are
beyond the traditional psychometric typologies originating
from ‘type theory’ and ‘trait theory’ (Bateman, Lowenhaupt
& Nacke, 2011). Rubinstein views the analysis from a
game-theoretic point of view and therefore the use of robust
statistical methods comes into the picture only for the sake
of validating the game-theoretic implications. The current
paper, in contrast, looks at an experiment from a statistical                Figure 1: Structures of the games 1, 2, 3, and 4.

analysis to develop a new kind of domain-specific typology.
Furthermore, to cross-validate the plausibility of the
developed typology, the interplay of the developed typology
with various degrees of rationality arising from theory of
mind (namely zero-order, first-order and second-order
theory of mind) will also be investigated. Thus, the focus of
this paper is two-fold: to study the typology of players from
the domain-specific viewpoint and to connect the gap
between discretely originated player types. Finally, the
study of such a typology of players helps to explain the
differences between people’s cognitive attitudes when

   In the experiment, however, the computer often makes an
apparently irrational first choice, operationalized as follows.
For each game item, the computer opponent had been
programmed to play according to plans that were best
responses to some plan of the participant. This was told to
the participants in order to bring them all on a uniform level
with respect to pre-knowledge of the game and to ensure
that their behavior is independent of their exposure to
computer games in personal life. In fact, each participant at
first played 14 practice games with which they got a feel of
the games before the start of the experiment. In the actual
experiment, they played 48 games divided in 8 rounds, each
comprised of 6 different game structures that were described
above (see Figures 1 and 2). Different graphical
representations of the same game were used in different
rounds. A break of 5 minutes was given after the participant
finished playing 4 rounds of the experimental games. At
some points during the experimental phase, the participants
were asked a multiple-choice question, as follows:
                                                                        Figure 3: Graphical interface of an example game item.
