analogical inference. Spontaneous transfer rate did not differ
significantly between the Verbal and Verbal + Diagram con-

Results are consistent with previous findings in that roughly

tion condition in supporting spontaneous transfer was linked
to deeper understanding of the source analog, we evaluated
participants’ responses to multiple-choice (MC) and free-
response (FR) source understanding questions. The four FR
questions assessed participants’ understanding of why the
cannon(s) failed or succeeded in each scenario. For FR re-
sponses, three key principles were chosen for each scenario–
e.g., the cannonballs were too large, or there were not enough
cannons. Participants received one point for each correctly
conveyed principle and had one point deducted for each in-
correct idea they stated. For each response, participants with
two or more points were given a score of 2, participants with
one point were given a score of 1, and participants with zero
points or less were given a score of 0. The FR responses in
each scenario were scored by two researchers. A third scorer
was employed for those responses where the first two dis-
agreed. If two of the three scorers agreed, their score was
used. If the three scorers disagreed, the response was jointly
discussed until two researchers agreed on a score. The agree-
ment rate for the first two scorers was 80% (Cohen’s κ = .62).
The agreement rate for the three scorers (i.e., cases where two
of the three scorers agreed) was 95%.
   The eight MC questions aimed to measure participants’ un-
derstanding of how the small and large cannonballs interact
with the various elements in the system, and how their forces
sum together across scenarios. Each MC question was scored
as either correct or incorrect, according to whether the partic-
ipant selected the correct amount of damage inflicted to the
specified element by the cannon(s). Participants received a
score between 0 and 8 for each of the FR and MC source               Figure 3: (A) Free-response and (B) multiple-choice source
