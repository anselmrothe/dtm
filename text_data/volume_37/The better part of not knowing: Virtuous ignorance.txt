chance (ps < .001). Thus, even though children distinguish
knowable and unknowable items in their difficulty ratings,
they seem unable to use this information to reject an
overconfident expert.
   An alternative interpretation might be that, even though
5-6-year-olds gave higher difficulty ratings for unknowable
items, their ratings are still below some threshold of
“implausibility,” but if any individual children recognized
this implausibility, they would be able to reject the
confident expert. This account predicts that, if difficulty
ratings for unknowable items and age group were pitted
against each other as predictors of performance on the
expert evaluation task, age group should be a weaker
predictor than difficulty rating. However, this is not the
case. In a stepwise regression of performance on                       Figure 2: Results of the forced-choice task in
