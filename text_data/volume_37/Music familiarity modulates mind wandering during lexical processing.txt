difference between listening to familiar music and listening
to the control sound clip in terms of mind wandering

Bootstrapping results showed that bias on our resampling

Semantic Relatedness Judgment Accuracy
On average, participants correctly judged 86% (SD = 0.34)
of the word pairs in semantic relatedness while listening to
familiar music, 86% (SD = 0.34) while listening to
unfamiliar music, and 87% (SD = 0.34) while listening to
the control excerpt. A mixed-effects logistical regression
model for correct (coded as 1) versus incorrect (coded as 0)
responses between the conditions was not significant (χ2(2)
= 0.89, p = 0.64). This suggests that participants performed
at near-ceiling levels regardless of the concurrent audio clip.
