             Intermediate Conclusion
Within a newly introduced task called the Contextual
Multi-Armed Bandit task, we have found that partic-
ipants can best be described by probability matching
outcomes of a (close to) rational non-parametric func-
tion learning engine. Probability matching used to be re-
ferred to as “biased” or “irrational” (Stanovich & West,
2008), but can actually constitute a very sensible strat-
egy, especially in dynamically changing environments
(Agrawal & Goyal, 2012). Therefore, one would expect
that participants should still be able to perform well even
in a dynamically changing environment. The second ex-
periment was designed to test this.

                Multi-Armed Bandit
The second experiment used a similar task as before.
However, this time the reward of a given arm (planet)
was dependent on how often the particular arm had or
had not been chosen previously. The rewards were de-
termined according to the following functions                    Figure 3: Distribution of obtained rewards (score) over
