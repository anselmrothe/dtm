ginning of each block. Participants put their heads on a chin
rest in order to stabilize their head movements.
In the study blocks, each trial began with a fixation circle
at the center of the screen for drift correction. Participants
were told to fixate at the circle to ensure that they were
looking at the center of the screen when the faces appear.
Trials were initiated by the experimenter once the participant was fixating on the circle. A target face was then presented at one of the four quarters of the screen for 5 seconds.
In the test blocks, the flow of the trials were the same as that
in the study blocks except that the images remained on the
screen until the participants responded by pressing one of
the two keys that indicated whether they remembered the
face or not. No feedback was given during the experiment.

Method
Participants
We recruited 48 participants, including 24 Chinese (7 males,
mean age 21.5, SD = 2.2) and 24 Caucasians (6 males, mean
age 21.2, SD = 7.5). Participants were given course credit or
honorariums. Asian participants were students at the University of Hong Kong. Of the Caucasian participants, three
were exchange students or staff at HKU; the remainders
were students at the University of Western Australia. All
participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

Hidden Markov model
Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are time-series models
that assume dependency between the current state of a timeseries data and its previous state. The states of the data are
hidden and can be estimated from the probabilistic association between the observed data and the states as well as
from the transitional probabilities between the states. An
HMM contains a vector of prior values, which indicates the
probability of the time-series beginning with each particular
state, a transition matrix, which specifies the transition
probabilities between any two hidden states, and a Gaussian
emission for each state, which captures the probabilistic
association between the observed data (e.g. eye fixation
duration) and a hidden state.
We trained one HMM per participant using the fixation
durations collected from all the trials in either the study or
the test blocks. Hence, each participant had two HMMs, one
trained on the study block trials and one the test block trials.
The hidden states represent clusters of durations that are of
similar length. We then categorized the HMMs trained on
the same blocks into groups using the variational hierarchical EM algorithm (VHEM) (Coviello et al., 2014). The
VHEM algorithm categorizes the input HMMs into groups
based on their similarities. It also produces a representation
HMM that summarizes the commonalities of the HMMs
within the group. The procedure was performed on the study
HMMs and test HMMs separately. For both the study and
the test blocks, we compared the recognition performance of
the groups discovered by the VHEM algorithm. Performance in the study blocks was measured by checking
whether the faces appeared in the study trials were identified
correctly in the test trials. Performance in the test blocks
was measured with d-prime.
For each group with similar fixation durations, we also
trained one HMM per participant and per block using the
fixation locations, and combined the individual HMMs into
a single representative HMM using VHEM to examine the
general fixation patterns in the group. We thus visualized
how the groups, which differed in their fixation durations,
also differed in the spatial distribution of the fixations.
Then, we trained one HMM per individual using only the
location information. The location HMMs were also catego-

Materials
The stimuli were a total of 56 colored frontal-view faces (28
Asians and 28 Caucasians). The Chinese faces were collected by Professor William Hayward at the University of Hong
Kong and the Caucasian faces were collected by Professor
Elinor McKone at Australian National University. Half of
the faces were females and half of them were males. All the
faces were with neutral expressions and were unfamiliar to
the participants. The faces were cropped around the chin
and ears, and some hair remained visible. The vertical
height of the faces was 384 pixels. The horizontal widths
varied due to natural variations in face shape and were on
average 298 pixels.
During the experiment, the faces were shown on a 22’’
CRT monitor with a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels that
was located approximately 60 cm from the participants,
which therefore allowed each image to subtend about 8 degrees of visual angle horizontally and 13 degrees vertically.

Procedure
The experiment consisted of two sessions, each with a study
block and a test block. Participants were allowed to take a
short break between the sessions. In the study block, participants were asked to remember 14 faces of the same race. A
total of 28 faces were selected for the study block and split
into two sets of 14 faces (7 males and 7 females). The two
sets were counterbalanced across participants. In the test
block that followed, participants were asked to recognize the
14 target faces among 14 foils.
Half of the participants viewed the Caucasian faces in the
first session and Asian faces in the second session. The other half viewed the Asian faces in the first session and Caucasian faces in the second session.
We recorded participants’ eye movements with EyeLink
1000 eye tracker. We used the default settings of the system
and performed a nine-point calibration procedure at the be-

Results
Categorization of the individual duration HMMs
We clustered the 48 study block HMMs into three groups
using the VHEM algorithm. The left side of Figure 1 shows
the representation HMM of each group. Table 1 shows that
there were approximately same numbers of Caucasians and
Asians in each group. No difference in racial distribution
over the groups was observed (χ2(2) = 0.12, p = .94).
It can be seen that the three groups had different patterns of
fixation durations. The first group usually began with a relatively short fixation, which was then followed by either another almost equally short or a much longer fixation. The
second group showed a different pattern. The first fixations
were also short. However, the following fixations were likely to be slightly longer, with 1/3 of the chance being much
longer. The third group was distinctive in that there was no
long fixation; all the three clusters were within the range of
0 to 500 msec. We found that the first fixations of Group 2
(210.1) were significantly longer than those of Group 3
(153.0), t(40) = 3.75, p < .01. The difference between Group
1 (180.1) and Group 2 (210.1), t(15) = 0.99, p = .33, and the
difference between Group 1 (180.1) and Group 3 (153.0),
t(35) = 1.49, p = .14, were not significant.
We compared the performance of the groups and discovered that Group 2 performed significantly better than the
other two groups. The hit rate of Group 2 (M = .85) was
significantly better (F(2, 45) = 4.9, p = .01) than Group 1 (M
= .68, t(15) = 2.98, p = .01), and Group 3 (M = .78, t(40) =
2.22, p = .03).
Similarly, we also clustered the 48 test block HMMs into
three groups. The right side images of Figure 1 show the
representation HMM of each group. Again, there were
roughly same numbers of Caucasians and Asians in each
group (χ2(2) = 0.16, p = .92; see Table 2).
The differences between the three groups were less obvious in the test blocks. The three duration clusters of the
Group 1 were highly overlapped. Groups 2 and 3 had rather
clear distinction between one and the other two clusters. As
can be seen from the transition matrices, all groups began
with short fixations, which are followed by some relatively
longer fixations. However, the durations in clusters of
Group 3 were shorter than that of Group 2. We found that
the first fixations of Group 3 (129.9) was significantly
shorter than that of Group 1 (189.2), t(35) = 7.62, p < .01,
and that of Group 2 (187.3), t(31) = 4.96, p < .01. Regarding
the average duration of all fixations, Group 2 (297.6) was
significantly longer than Group 1 (244.9), t(24) = 6.49, p <
.01, and Group 3 (214.9), t(31) = 9.39, p < .01. Comparison

Analysis of fixation locations for duration groups
Using the groups uncovered above, we then estimated a
representative HMM for each group using the fixation locations. Figure 2 shows representation HMMs for the study
blocks (left) and the test blocks (right).
The images show that for study blocks, Group 1 usually
just fixated at everywhere on a face rather than any specific
facial feature. Groups 2 and 3, on the other hand, usually
began with fixations that help them to locate the face on the
screen, which was then followed by fixations concentrated
more on the eyes. The difference between the two groups
can be observed from the transitions. Group 2 explored different parts of a face, while Group 3 tended to stare at only
some parts of a face. For Group 2, the transition probability
from the red cluster to green cluster was about the same as
staying in red (~47%), and likewise when starting in the
green cluster. For Group 3, the probability to stay in red was
almost twice that of a transition from red to green, and similarly for the green cluster.
The test block HMMs show somewhat different results.
Although the spatial distributions of the three clusters in
each group seemed different, the transition matrices suggest
that the differences were subtle. All three groups began with
a fixation without any specific target, which was followed
by fixations either again without a target facial feature or
more concentrated on the eyes. The chances of two options
are about 50-50. The result suggests that when participants
were required to identify the faces, all different groups paid
more attention to the eyes.

Categorization of the individual location HMMs
For the study block, we clustered the 48 location HMMs
into three groups. The left images of Figure 3 show the
study block representation HMMs of each group. Table 3
shows the numbers of Caucasians and Asians in each group.
There were significantly more Asians than Caucasians in
Group 3 (χ2 (2) = 6.57, p = .04).
Group 1 looked mainly at the whole face without a specific target. There were occasionally fixations to the lower
part of the face (transition from red to blue is 10%). Group 2
and Group 3 both spent more time on the eyes. However,

395

while Group 3 mainly started from some random areas on a
face and then consistently transited between the two eyes
and other areas, Group 2 in some cases were likely to begin
with and to remain staring at the eyes. Comparison of the
recognition performances (hit rate) shows a significant efStudy Block

there were roughly equal numbers of Caucasians and Asians
in Groups 1 and 2, but more Asians than Caucasians in

Group 1 demonstrated a holistic viewing pattern; no facial feature was looked at in specific. Group 2 looked at the
two eyes respectively after the first fixations, and in some
cases paid some attention to the mouth (~7%). Group 3
showed a similar pattern to that of Group 1, but with more
attention devoted only to the right eye. Comparison of the
recognition performances (d’ prime) discovered that a significant effect of grouping, F(2, 45) = 5.86, p = .01, results

Group 3 (M = 1.54, t(32) = 2.89, p = .01).

Discussion
The results have shown that duration is an informative
source of information about the strategies participants
adopted that lead to better performance in face recognition,
in addition to fixation location information.
By grouping participants into three groups using only the
duration information, we have discovered a significant difference in the performance of the participants. In the study
blocks, the hit rate was the best for Group 2, which had almost exclusively short fixations at beginning and longer
fixations afterwards. The spatial distribution of the fixations
shows that Group 2 was more likely than Group 3 to shuffle
between ROIs, indicating that best performance was
achieved by looking at different parts of a face (with long
fixations) than staring at only one facial feature. Grouping
of the location HMMs have shown a similar tendency. People who looked at other areas as well as focused on the eyes
performed better than the others.
The result that all the participants showed shorter first fixations and longer following fixations was also consistent
with that reported by Hsiao & Cottrell (2008), in which it
was found that for the study phase, the first fixations were
shorter and the following ones gradually increased in duration. With the HMMs, we found that although the pattern
was shared by all the participants, differences in duration
and transition patterns among the subgroups were associated
with performance difference.
For the test blocks, although all 3 groups of the duration
HMMs generally had short first fixations, comparison between groups showed that for Group 3, which had the best
performance, their first fixations were significantly shorter
than those in Group 1 and 2. The location HMMs shown in

397

Figure 3 (right) have revealed that those who looked specifically at the two eyes (Group 2 in Figure 3) performed better
in the test blocks. The performance of those who looked
only at the right eye (Group 3) was the same as the holistic
viewing people (Group 1). Since the first fixation is usually
for locating the face, together with the duration analysis, this
may imply that some of the better performing people have a
more consistent strategy to locate faces on the screen, so
that their first fixations are shorter, and then subsequently
look at both eyes for face identification. Yet, some participants (Group 2 of the duration HMMs in Figure 1) had
longer average fixation duration than the rest but achieved
level of performance comparable to that of Group 3, suggesting the existence of individual differences.
The observation that in the test block most participants
spent shorter time on fixating at the faces than the study
block is contradictory to the finding from the study blocks,
which showed that people whose fixations were all short
tended to perform worse (Group 3 of duration HMMs in the
study blocks in Figure 1). This may indicate that different
strategies had been adopted for the study and test blocks. It
is convergent to Hsiao and Cottrell (2008) and Henderson et
al., (2005), which showed that the strategies participants
adopted in different tasks were different.
The current study also demonstrates the advantages of using HMMs to analyze fixation durations. HMMs contain
clusters and their transition information. The clusters categorize durations of similar length into same clusters, and the
transition information reveals the transitions between clusters, so that the duration information in eye movement data
could be more precisely interpreted. Moreover, HMMs are
able to capture individual differences because each participant is modeled with an HMM. By clustering the HMMs
into groups, similar viewing strategies shared by a number
of participants could be discovered from data. For example,
the test block categorization result shows that good performance could be achieved by two different strategies, one
with shorter and one with longer fixation durations. The
discovery of the long fixation strategy is only possible when
individual differences have been taken into account during
the analyses.
In summary, the findings suggest that duration can be an
informative source to understanding eye movements in face
recognition. It distinguishes good performers from bad performers in both study and test blocks. Together with the
analyses with location information, our results suggest that
an exploratory strategy looking at different facial features
(especially the eyes) with long fixations is beneficial in the
study phase, whereas in the test phase, an efficient, short
first orienting fixation followed by a more analytic pattern
focusing mainly on the eyes leads to better performances.
