expectations about rewards and value computation (Smith &
Huettel, 2010). Monetary reward experience and evaluation
processes have been found to activate several interconnected
regions of this system, including the deep structures of the
brain stem at ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the ventral
striatum (vSTR), as well as the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC) (Schultz, 2006; Knutson et al., 2000;
Knutson et al., 2003). Especially the receipt of rewards were
found to evoke activation in the vmPFC and the adjacent
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which support the theory that
these regions may be involved with computing the expected
value of a reward (Knutson et al., 2005). Even activations
observed at mPFC and straitum during passive viewing of
products can be later used for predicting that consumer’s
choices involving those products (Levy et al., 2011). In a
recent study, Metereu & Dreher (2015) found that the
OFC/vmPFC region encodes a general unsigned anticipatory
subjective value signal for both rewards and punishments.
Real world decision-making often involves uncertainty,
which is another crucial factor that modulates the values
attributed to choices. Imaging studies that involve
uncertainties and risks in decision-making report activations
in dorsolateral and lateral PFC, vmPFC, orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as
subcortical regions including VTA, vSTR and amygdala
(Holper et al., 2014; Smith & Huettel, 2010). This distributed
neural network is claimed to encode two components of a
subjective value signal, namely expected value and risk
probability (Schonberg et al., 2012; Ogawa et al., 2014). The
medial and lateral prefrontal cortex is claimed to play a role
in integrating these two components (Tobler et al., 2009). The
computations carried out in these regions are likely to be
associated with subjective value signals, but not as robustly
as the vmPFC/OFC regions. In particular, the dorso-lateral
regions are argued to have a regulatory role on medial PFC
during decision making scenarios (McClure et al., 2004).
However, the precise computational roles played by the
dorso-medial and dorso-lateral areas remain to be an
important issue in simple choice and reward processing
paradigms in neuroeconomics (Rangel & Clithero, 2014).

Abstract
Existing neuroimaging studies in decision making
predominantly employ the fMRI method. Despite its superior
spatial resolution, fMRI is an expensive and impractical
neuroimaging technology for purchasing behavior studies in
the field. This study aims to explore the role of prefrontal
cortex during purchasing behavior by utilizing functional nearinfrared (fNIR) spectroscopy; a low-cost, non-invasive and
portable optical brain imaging methodology. The findings
suggest that fNIRS can be effectively used for developing a
neuro-physiologically informed, predictive model of
purchasing behavior based on multivariate effects of
activations in frontopolar, dorso-medial and dorso-lateral
prefrontal cortex.

Introduction
Neuroeconomics has emerged as an interdisciplinary field to
develop a better understanding of neurobiological factors that
shape economic decisions (Politser, 2008). In particular,
neuroeconomics research seeks to further our understanding
with regards to what variables are computed by the brain
while humans are making different kinds of decisions, and
how those computations are implemented and constrained by
underlying neurobiological processes, with the eventual goal
of building biologically plausible models for human decision
making (Rangel & Clithero, 2014). Existing work in the field
include decision making scenarios ranging from simple
decision tasks such as choosing pizza over salad for lunch to
decision making under uncertain, dynamically unfolding
circumstances such as gambling tasks (Glimcher & Fehr,
2014). Although these studies include rather simplistic
decision making scenarios due to the limitations imposed by
brain imaging tools, they collectively identified important
neural mechanisms for related cognitive and emotional
processes such as reward evaluation, ambiguity/risk
management and value comparison (Smith & Huettel, 2010).
A number of brain imaging studies have focused on the role
of the dopaminergic system in forming and updating

Existing studies in neuroeconomics predominantly employ
the fMRI method. Despite its superior spatial resolution,
fMRI is an expensive and impractical neuroimaging
technology for purchasing behavior studies in the field. In
this paper, the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
method was employed to study purchasing behavior, which
offers a low-cost, non-invasive and portable optical brain
imaging methodology. The aim of this study is to explore the
plausibility of the fNIRS methodology for neuroeconomics
applications, as well as to develop a neuro-physiologically
informed predictive model of purchasing behavior based on
fNIR measurements.
There are only a few fNIR studies published in
neuroeconomics context. Existing fNIR studies have
identified activation patterns in the prefrontal cortex during
product selection (Kumagai, 2012), risk assessment (Holper,
2014), financial investment (Shimokawa et al., 2009) and
price prediction (Mitsuda et al., 2012). Mitsuda et al. (2012)
also proposed a support vector machine algorithm for
classifying price/product pairings that were tagged as
expensive or inexpensive by the participants with an accuracy
of 70%. The present study aims to contribute this line of
inquiry by investigating activation patterns in PFC of
consumers during a more realistic, mundane purchasing
scenario. In particular, we aimed to identify whether positive
and negative purchasing decisions differ in terms of the
neural activity they elicit in regions located at fronto-polar,
dorso-medial and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
experiment design and the fNIR optical brain imaging
technology employed are described in the next section. Next,
we present our main findings regarding activation patterns in
fronto polar, dmPFC and dlPFC regions. This section also
presents a discriminant analysis model that predict the
purchasing decision offline in terms of changes detected in
oxy and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations in these brain
regions. The paper concludes with an overall discussion of
the results.

product, 4 seconds for viewing the price of the product and 4
seconds to respond according to their preference to purchase
or not to purchase, followed by a fixation for 8 seconds. Each
block lasted for 20 seconds. The total duration of the
experiment was 26 minutes. E-Prime software was used for
the presentation of the experiment stimulus. The keys
participants need to press to indicate buy or pass preference
were randomly switched in each block to avoid lateralization
biases. The products consisted of 3 main groups (food,
cleaning and personal care products). There were 39 products
in the food group (e.g. milk, cheese, Coke), 17 products in
the cleaning group (e.g. detergents) and 22 products in the
personal care group (e.g. deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste).
The prices of the products were obtained from local
groceries.
The participants were told that they should press a button
to indicate whether they would purchase the displayed item
given its price. They were also informed that the
experimenters would be able to provide them up to a total
40TL (Turkish Lira) worth of the products that they selected.
Subjects were also told that if they do not spend at least 40TL,
they would receive only half of the unspent amount in an
effort to reinforce buying behavior.

Material and Methods
33 participants (17 female) in the age range 18-46 have
participated in this experiment. They were selected randomly
from the consumer database of ThinkNeuro. All participants
were right-handed as measured by the Edinburgh handedness
survey (Oldfield, 1971). None of the participants had a
history of psychiatric disorders. Participants were paid 10 TL
for their participation and 40 TL as a bonus in compensation
for the items they selected to purchase during the experiment.
The data of one participant has been excluded due to the fact
that he has not made any buy or pass responses during the
experiment. The study was approved by the METU human
subjects research ethics committee. Written informed consent
was obtained prior to the experiment.
The task was comprised of 78 trials where participants
were asked to make purchasing decisions for the displayed
products based on the suggested prices. In each block, the
participants had 4 seconds for viewing a picture of the

During the experiment the prefrontal cortex of each
participant was monitored with a continuous wave functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR) system developed at
Drexel University (Philadelphia, PA), manufactured and
supplied by fNIR Devices LLC (Potomac, MD;
www.fnirdevices.com). The system is composed of three
modules: a flexible headpiece (sensor pad), which holds 4
light sources and 10 detectors to obtain oxygenation
measures at 16 optodes on the prefrontal cortex; a control box
for hardware management; and a computer that runs the data
COBI Studio software (Ayaz et al., 2011) for data acquisition

Photons that enter tissue undergo two different types of
interaction: absorption and scattering (Obrig et al., 2000).
Two chromophores, oxy- and deoxy-Hb, are strongly linked
to tissue oxygenation and metabolism. The absorption spectra
of oxy- and deoxy-Hb remain significantly different from
each other allowing spectroscopic separation of these
compounds to be possible by using only a few sample
wavelengths. Once photons are introduced into the human
head, they are either scattered by extra- and intracellular
boundaries of different layers of the head (skin, skull,
cerebrospinal fluid, brain, etc.) or absorbed mainly by oxyand deoxy-Hb. A photo-detector placed on the skin surface at
a certain distance from the light source can collect the
photons that are scattered and thus have travelled along a
“banana shaped path” from the source to the detector, which
carry important information about the optical properties of
the diffused neural tissue (Figure 2). This raw light
attenuation information is then converted into tissue
oxygenation measures that quantify the relative changes in
the presence of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin within the
banana shaped path by using a method called modified Beer
Lambert law (Cope et al., 1988).

(Figure 1). The sensor has a source-detector separation of
2.5cm, which allows for approximately 1.25cm penetration
depth. This system can monitor changes in relative
concentrations of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at a temporal
resolution of 2Hz. The locations of 16 regions on the cortical
surface monitored by fNIR are displayed in Figure 1 above,
which correspond to Broadmann areas 9, 10, 44 and 45.
fNIR is a neuroimaging modality that enables continuous,
noninvasive, and portable monitoring of changes in blood
oxygenation and blood volume related to human brain
function. Neuronal activity is determined with respect to the
changes in oxygenation since variation in cerebral
hemodynamics are related to functional brain activity
through a mechanism known as neurovascular coupling
(Obrig et al., 2000). Over the last decade, studies in the
laboratory have established that fNIR spectroscopy provides
a veridical measure of oxygenation and blood flow in the
brain (Bunce et al., 2006). fNIR is not only non-invasive,
safe, affordable and portable, it also provides a balance
between temporal and spatial resolution which makes fNIR a
viable option for in-the field neuroimaging.
fNIR technology uses specific wavelengths of light,
introduced at the scalp, to enable the non-invasive
measurement of changes in the relative ratios of
deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb or HbR) and
oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb or HbO2) in the capillary
beds during brain activity. Typically, an optical apparatus for
fNIR Spectroscopy consists of at least one near infra-red light
source and a detector that receives light after it has interacted
with the tissue. Near-infrared light is known to diffuse
through the intact scalp and skull, which makes it suitable for
tracing relative changes in the concentration of specific
chromophores in the neural tissue with non-invasive,
spectroscopic methods (Jobsis, 1977). Whereas most
biological tissue (including water) are relatively transparent
to light in the near infrared range between 700 to 900 nm,
hemoglobin is a strong absorber of light waves in this range
of the spectrum. Within 700 to 900 nm, oxy and deoxyhemoglobin are among the highest absorbers of infra-red
light. This provides an optical window into neural tissue
where one can approximate relative changes in the
concentration of oxy and deoxy-hemoglobin based on how
infra-red light is attenuated in neural tissue.

Results
For each participant, buy/pass decisions, response time, total
money spent and raw fNIR measures were obtained for a total
of 78 grocery items. Raw fNIR data (16 optodes×2
wavelengths) were low-pass filtered with a finite impulse
response, linear phase filter with order 20 and cut-off
frequency of 0.1 Hz to attenuate the high frequency noise due
to respiration and cardiac cycle effects (Ayaz et al., 2012).
Saturated channels (if any), in which light intensity at the
detector was higher than the analog-to-digital converter limit
were excluded. Artifacts due to motion are detected and
excluded by applying the sliding windows motion artifact
filter (Ayaz, 2011). fNIR data epochs for the rest and task
periods were extracted from the continuous data using time
synchronization markers. Blood oxygenation changes within
each 16 optodes for the product, price and decision blocks
were calculated using the modified Beer-Lambert Law for
task periods with respect to rest periods at the beginning of
each trial with the fnirSoft software (Ayaz, 2010).
The average oxygenation level of each block was
calculated and the obtained oxygenation levels for three
blocks (that consist of product-price-decision) were classified
according to the buy or pass decisions of the participants. The
12 sec long trials were then averaged to form evoked
oxygenation (i.e. ΔHbO2 minus ΔHbR) signals displayed in
Figure 3 as a measure of brain activation. Univariate 2x3
repeated measures ANOVA conducted for each 16 voxel
separately indicated that buy versus pass decisions elicit a
significant difference in average oxygenation for only voxel
10, F(1,186) = 7.65, p< .01, η2=.04. This area corresponds to
the right fronto-polar cortex, which is associated with
subjective value management. No significant difference was
found between product-price-purchase block types. The

the sample into two subgroups in terms of their sensitivity to
the budget limit. 11 participants who ended up spending
within 20TL of the target range constitute the budgetsensitive group (mean=42.91 TL, sd=12.92), whereas the
remaining 21 subjects formed the budget-insensitive group
(mean=122.65 TL, sd=43.68). The analysis was repeated on
these subgroups in an effort to observe if budgetary
considerations made any difference in oxygenation trends.
In both of these groups, we observed that positive and
negative purchasing decisions elicited higher activity in the
frontopolar and dmPFC areas, albeit in different directions.
Figure 5a below shows the temporal trend in average
oxygenation changes observed during buy and pass decisions
of the budget sensitive group. When the data of the budgetsensitive group are analyzed separately, optode 10 has been
observed to preserve its significant role in the direction of buy
decisions against pass decisions (F(1,60)=18.05, p<.05,
η2=.23). Moreover, there have been other optodes that appear
to have significant difference including voxel 3
(F(1,60)=11.44, p<.01, η2=.16), voxel 7 (F(1,60)=9.46,
p<.01, η2=.14), voxel 8 (F(1,60)=10.95, p<.05, η2=.15), voxel
9 (F(1,60)=24.37, p<.001, η2=.29), voxel 11 (F(1,60)=18.05,
p<.001, η2=.23), voxel 12 (F(1,60)=20.42, p<.001, η2=.25),
voxel 14 (F(1,42)=4.42, p<.05, η2=.20) and voxel 15
(F(1,54)=4.16, p<.05, η2=.07). Block type and interaction
effects were not significant.

Figure 4 below shows the projection of pairwise t-statistics
for each voxel with BSpline interpolation. The most
significant differences in average oxygenation values are
clustered around voxel 10, which is consistent with fMRI
findings (e.g. Knutson et al., 2007).

Figure 4. Projection of t-statistics map on brain surface
image shows the increase in oxygenation around optode 10
during purchase decisions. BSpline interpolation was used
to generate surface representation from t values of
comparisons of each buy vs pass conditions along with
thresholding by significance limit p<0.001 with df=24.
There was considerable variability among participants in
terms of the total money they spent during the experiment
(mean=95.24 TL, sd=52.38). Participants were not provided
any feedback regarding the total money they spent during the
experiment, and were encouraged to decide per item, even
though they were informed that they could be given the
products up to a total of 40TL. However, the distribution of
total purchases suggest that some participants paid extra
attention to their total spending. For that reason, we divided

in the direction of pass decisions. These optodes include
voxel 5 (F(1,120)=14.22, p<.001, η2=.11), voxel 6
(F(1,120)=12.96, p<.001, η2=.10), voxel 8 (F(1,120)=8.84,
p<.01, η2=.07) and voxel 12 (F(1,120)=9.72, p<.01, η2=.08).
Figure 5b shows the temporal trend in average oxygenation
changes observed during buy and pass decisions of the budget
insensitive group. Finally, block type and interaction effects
were not significant in this group as well. To sum up, the
temporal trend of average oxygenation values exhibit a
different pattern across budget sensitive and insensitive
groups.

and budget-insensitive groups (F(1,75)=8.56, p<.01, Pillai
Trace=.53). The results have also been significant for the
entire sample (F(10,123)=2.67, p<.01, Pillai Trace=.18).
Block type and interaction effects were not significant.
The MANOVA analysis was followed up with a
discriminant analysis to observe how buy and pass decisions
differ from each other. The discriminant analysis was
performed on the whole group as well as on the budget
subgroups. In each group, a single variate was found to
significantly distinguish buy and pass decisions, whose
coefficients are presented in Table 1.
Table 1 suggests that when budget sensitivity is not taken
into account, buy or pass decisions can be predicted with 62%
accuracy, which is above chance level. When additional
information about budgetary sensitivity is provided, the

expected predictive accuracy can be estimated as ∗ 0.82 +

Discussion
The obtained results bear similarities with findings of
existing fMRI studies in frontopolar regions. Positive
purchasing decisions significantly increase the neural activity
through frontopolar regions, which are closely related to OFC
and vmPFC that modulate the computation of subjective
values. Frontopolar regions such as voxel 10 remain to be
activated in a similar way across budget sensitive and
insensitive subgroups, which support the general role
attributed to the OFC and its projections in the frontopolar
cortex for subjective value computation.
Our results also suggest that the general purchasing
tendency of the participants can significantly alter some of
the activation patterns observed in other parts of the
prefrontal cortex. Products ended up being purchased tend to
elicit strong activation in voxel 10 as compared to other
prefrontal regions. In the budget sensitive group, this
activation trend had to remain strong as compared to dmPFC
and dlPFC activations until the end of a trial to elicit a buy
decision. In the budget insensitive group, voxel 10 activity
remains high during buy decisions as well. No purchase cases
also elicit comparable level of activity in voxel 10, which
tend to drop towards the end of a trial together with an
increase in activation in voxels 5,6 and 12 located in dmPFC.
These dmPFC sites seem to inhibit the tendency to purchase
in the budget insensitive group, as it was evidenced in the
oxygenation trend observed during no purchase cases for the
budget insensitive group. In the budget sensitive group
increase in dmPFC activity has a reverse role, where it
correlates with buy rather than pass decisions.
These findings implicate that the neurophysiological
modeling of purchasing decisions cannot be based solely on
increased neural activity in frontopolar regions. When the
participants were classified according to their budget
sensitivity, the predictive accuracy of the model has increased

Related fMRI work has reported on the prominent role of
the functional connectivity between medial PFC and dlPFC
on the modulation of economic decisions (Ogawa et al.,
2014). Since our findings from fNIR suggest differential
temporal trends in oxygenation for our subgroups and the
measurement locations include some of the functionally
connected regions of interest in frontopolar, dorsomedial and
dorsolateral sites, we also employed multivariate methods to
observe if buy/pass decisions can be distinguished based on
multivariate trends across multiple channels. For that
purpose, a 2x3 MANOVA was performed on the oxygenation
levels for the voxels 7,8,9,10 (left and right fronto-polar
cortex), voxels 5-6 (left dmPFC), voxels 12-13 (right
dmPFC) and voxels 3-14 (left and right dlPFC). The
MANOVA results indicate significant difference for both the
budget-sensitive (F(10,33)=2.49, p<.05, Pillai Trace=.43)

from 60% to 80%. The difference among these two groups
might be related to differences in their working memory
capacities for keeping the budget constraint as part of their
goal state. dmPFC is particularly involved with goal
maintenance and response selection processes, which seem to
contribute to the differences observed between these groups.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that fNIR can be
used to monitor activations in the prefrontal cortex during
purchasing decisions. Moreover, multivariate analysis
techniques can be effectively employed on oxygenation
trends to build predictive computational models with
reasonable accuracy. In the future, we aim to better exploit
the portability of fNIR to explore neural underpinnings of
economic decisions in more ecologically valid contexts.
