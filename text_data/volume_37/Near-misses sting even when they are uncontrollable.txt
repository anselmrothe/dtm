we build upon a previous model of affective cognition (Ong

paradigm that allowed us to parametrically vary features of
the situation that would impact judgment of emotions. We ex-
plicitly incorporate near-miss effects into our existing quanti-
tative model, which allowed us to estimate the extent to which
observers believe agents who were close, as compared to far,
from desirable outcomes felt negative emotion. We could fur-

with achieving relatively favorable or unfavorable outcomes,

   Thus, we find that whereas a large majority of participants
said that both characters felt equally bad, this is primarily
due to the fact that both characters lost. This suggests that
near-miss effects on emotion attribution are smaller in mag-
nitude than those associated with winning or losing in gen-
eral, though they contribute a significant additional influence.
Thus, the results provide evidence that observers are sensi-
tive to near-miss effects in this scenario and they (irrationally)
judge near-misses based on a randomly-determined distance
that the agent has no control over.

a number (based on their choice). In the Number condition,
the position of the goal was known, but the number was un-
known – characters picked a number and were assigned a po-
sition. The two conditions differed in which dimension (posi-
tion or number) the characters had control over. Importantly,
the games were still random events, and the agents’ control
is merely illusory. For example, consider the Position con-
dition. One can imagine a possible counterfactual statement
generated by Scott, the close distance character: “if only I had
chosen the card one position down”. However, if the games
were truly random, his re-picking a different card position
would still have given him the same 1/20 chance of winning.
