Abstract
While the P600 is generally presumed to be a uniform response
elicited consistently across individuals in specific syntactic
contexts, Tanner and Van Hell (2014) showed evidence of distinct
response profiles (N400 or P600 dominant) for syntactic
violations across individuals. The current analysis used Tanner
and Van Hell’s response-dominance index (RDI) to examine the
impact of response dominance on comprehension of garden-path
sentences. P600 dominant individuals showed enhanced
comprehension of garden-path sentences, even when controlling
for working memory capacity. Response dominance as an
individual difference measure has the potential to enhance
understanding of the neurocognitive basis of sentence processing
and greater cognition in general.
Keywords: P600; N400; Response Dominance Index; GardenPath; Working Memory.

Introduction
Over the past thirty years, research using the event-related
potential (ERP) technique has provided many important
insights into the neural mechanisms associated with language
comprehension. The integration of lexico-semantic
information is associated with an increased centro-parietal
negativity between 300-500 ms known as the N400 (Kutas &
Hillyard 1980). Morphosyntactic integration is associated
with an early left anterior negativity (LAN) maximal around
200-500 ms, followed by a late posterior positivity (P600)
maximal between 500 and 800 ms (see Kutas, Van Petten &
Kluender (2005) for review). While the LAN/P600 complex
is elicited by morphosyntactic violations of all types, the
P600, in absence of early negativity, is also elicited by wellformed sentences that present increased difficulty due to
temporary ambiguity (i.e. garden-paths; Gouvea, Phillips,
Kazanina & Poeppel, 2010; Osterhout, Holcomb & Swinney,
1994).
The use of ERP as a means of indexing the different neural
mechanisms associated with language processing is
contingent on the assumption that all neurologically normal,
native speakers show consistent responses to sentence stimuli
such that the grand averaged ERPs reflect effects that are
manifest uniformly across individuals.
This notion was recently challenged by Tanner and Van
Hell (2014). In their innovative study, they showed that,
although in the grand mean syntactic violations elicited a
classic biphasic LAN/P600 response, most participants either
showed an N400 or a P600 rather than a biphasic response.
Given the topographical distribution of the effects for each
group, they concluded that the LAN often found for syntactic
violations in grand mean analyses is the result of the

distributed negativity in some subjects being neutralized or
minimized by the right lateralized positivity in the others such
that only the left anterior negativity remains. Response
dominance did not, however, predict acceptability judgment
accuracy, nor did it correlate with measures of working
memory (WM) and executive control. Familial lefthandedness alone exhibited a relationship with the response
dominance index (RDI).
The individual differences in N400/P600 response
dominance observed by Tanner and Van Hell (2014) led to
interesting questions regarding other contexts which tend to
elicit these potentials. Although sentences that are wellformed but contain garden-paths typically elicit a P600 with
the absence of an early negativity (Friederici, Mecklinger,
Spencer, Steinhauer, & Donchin, 2001; Frisch, Schlesewsky,
Saddy, & Alperman, 2002; Gouvea et al., 2010; Horberg,
Koptjevskaja, & Kallioinen, 2013; Matzke, Mai, Nager,
Rossler, & Münte, 2002; Osterhout, Holcomb & Swinney,
1994; Vos et al., 2001a), there is some variability as many
studies do observe early effects. Horberg et al. (2013) found
early centro-parietal negativity while Matzke et al. (2002)
found early anterior negativities. Early positivities have also
been found, both posterior (Gouvea et al., 2010; Vos et al.,
2001a) and broadly distributed (Friederici et al., 2001)
Though the effects associated with the resolution of
garden-paths are not considered to be biphasic, the variability
in findings could suggest the possibility of individual
differences in response profiles, as Tanner and Van Hell
(2014) found for syntactic violations. Furthermore, even if all
studies found P600s in absence of negativity, the lack of early
effects could be the result of early negativities and positivities
cancelling each other out.
One known source of variability in garden-path effects for
both P600s and comprehension accuracy is working memory
capacity (WMC). WM is “a multicomponent system
responsible for active maintenance of information in the face
of ongoing processing and/or distraction” (Conway, Kane,
Bunting, Hambrick, Wilhelm & Engle, 2005, p. 770) which
facilitates goal directed behavior. High WMC individuals
show greater P600 effects for garden-path sentences
compared to low WMC individuals (Friederici, Steinhauer,
Mecklinger, & Meyer, 1998). High WMC individuals also
show reduced garden-path effects in comprehension accuracy
such that they have better comprehension accuracy for
garden-paths (Just & Carpenter, 1992). Lower
comprehension accuracy in low WMC individuals indicates
that they are more likely to arrive at “Good Enough”
interpretations (Ferreira, Bailey & Ferraro, 2002) in which

1751

the faithful interpretation of the sentence is not adopted. As
Slattery, Sturt, Christianson, Yoshida and Ferreira (2013)
note, this could be due to a failure to fully reanalyze the
structure created during the initial incorrect parse or to a
failure to discard the initial incorrect interpretation. Both
possibilities represent distinct attentional demands,
specifically the ability to recall information in the face of
ongoing processing (reanalysis) and the ability to
discard/suppress information that is no longer goal relevant
(discarding incorrect parse). The former can be assessed with
complex span tasks (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Unsworth,
Heitz, Schrock, and Engle, 2005) while the latter can be
indexed by performance on positive lures in the n-back task
(Conway et al., 2005). It is necessary, therefore, to consider
the role of WM when examining individual differences
associated with the resolution of garden-path sentences.
The goal of the current study is to determine (1) if
participants’ N400/P600 dominance for garden-path
sentences will fall into a continuum such that there will be a
continuous distribution of N400 and P600 effect magnitudes
with negative correlations between them, (2) if the N400 and
P600 dominant participants will show qualitatively different
sentence type effects in the ERP data, (3) if response
dominance will predict comprehension accuracy and (4), if
so, is that effect reducible to individual differences in WMC.

Methods
Participants
Data were collected from 60 right handed participants, 15 of
which were excluded due to eligibility issues, technical
issues, noncompliance, or attrition. An additional 8 were
excluded for excessive artifacts. As a result, 37 participants
(20 female) between the ages of 18 and 35 (M = 21.6, SD =
3.21) were included in the analyses. All participants were
right-handed, neurologically normal, native speakers of
English with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and none
had started learning a second language before age 12.

Sentence Stimuli
For the syntactic complexity conditions, this experiment
used the same control and garden-path sentences as
O’Rourke & Colflesh (2014) (based on Gouvea et al., 2010;
see Table 1).
Table 1. Examples of Sentence Types
Type

Example

GardenPath

The patient met the doctor and the nurse

Control

The patient met the doctor while the nurse
with the white dress showed the chart
during the meeting.

Fifty percent of the sentences were followed by
comprehension questions, which included questions that
directly targeted the resolution of the garden-path structure.
ERP data was time-locked to a matrix verb (underlined in
Table 1).
In addition to the target sentences, there were 288 other
sentences (108 fillers and 180 sentences in experimental
conditions not reported herein; see O’Rourke & Colflesh
2014 for details on fillers) making a total of 360 sentences.
Due to the large number of sentences, the sentence processing
task was divided across two experimental sessions.

Working Memory Tasks
Complex Span Tasks Three complex span tasks were used
in the current study: reading span, operation span, and
symmetry span. In automated reading span (Unsworth, et al.,
2005) participants were presented with a series of sentences
and asked to indicate, via button press, if the sentence they
read made sense. After each sentence they were then
presented with a letter that they were to remember for later
recall. At the end of the sequence, they had to recall the letters
in serial order. Their score reflects the total number of letters
recalled in the correct serial position out of a total of 75 items.
Automated operation span (Unsworth, Redick, Heitz,
Broadway, & Engle, 2009) was identical to reading span as
described above except instead of making sense judgments
on sentences, participants had to read math problems
involving two operations, one addition/subtraction and one
multiplication/division, and verify if the solution provided
was correct.
In automated symmetry span (Unsworth et al., 2009)
participants were presented with a series of 8x8 black and
white grids and asked to indicate, via button press, whether
the design was vertically symmetrical. After each symmetry
judgment they were presented with a 4x4 grid with a square
filled in red that they were asked to remember for later recall.
At the end of the sequence, participants had to recall the
position of the red squares in serial order. Their score reflects
the total number of red squares recalled in the correct serial
position out of a total of 42.
N-Back In the n-back task (Conway et al., 2005), participants
were presented with a sequence of single letters and asked to
judge if the current letter is the same as the one that occurred
n places back in the sequence. For example, in a 2-back task,
the second “X” in the following sequence would be a target:
X U X X F U U. Lures, which appeared one space before a
target (n-1; the third “U”), one space after a target (n+1; the
third “X”), or two spaces after a target (n+2; the second “U”)
were also included. Participants in the current experiment
performed 2-back and 4-back, with lures. Accuracy in the
positive lure conditions reflects the ability to successfully
discard recently activated information that is no longer goal
relevant. Mean accuracy for n+1 and n+2 lures in the 2-back
task was used as a covariate in the ANCOVA.

EEG Recording
Electroencephalographic (EEG) data was acquired using the
Electrical Geodesics Inc. (EGI) Hydrocel 256 channel
system. Data were recorded using Net Station 4.5.4
(Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene, OR). The signal was
high-pass filtered online at 0.1 Hz, low-pass filtered at 30 Hz.
The EEG signal was sampled at 250 Hz. Impedances were
kept below 50 KΩ where possible and otherwise under 100
KΩ, as is customary with high density EEG recordings. EEG
was recorded using CZ as a reference and later re-referenced
to the global mean. Prior to averaging, eye blinks, and other
artifacts were identified and excluded from analysis via Net
Station’s algorithms for artifact detection and ocular artifact
removal. Bad channels were corrected when possible via
NetStation’s correction tool. Participants with more than 30%
rejected trials were not included in the analysis resulting in
the exclusion of eight participants. In the subjects included in
the analysis, 15% of trials were rejected on average.

Procedure
The sentence processing task was divided across two
sessions, each lasting approximately 2.5 hours. In each
session, participants performed the sentence processing task
while EEG was recorded, and then they completed a subset
of the WM assessments (the three complex span tasks, nback, and two additional measures not reported herein).
Sentences appeared word-by-word in the center of a highresolution computer screen. Each word was presented for 300
ms, followed by a blank of 200 ms. The final word of the
sentence was presented with a period and was followed by a
5500 ms rest period. Half of the test sentences were followed
by a comprehension question. The questions were presented
in their entirety for 2500 ms, followed by a 3500 ms rest
period. Key presses were used for “yes” and “no” responses
to the questions. Within each session, the stimuli were broken
into 6 runs each consisting of 27 sentences, lasting
approximately 8 minutes. The EEG part of the session,
including electrode application and removal, lasted
approximately 1.5 hours. After electrode removal,
participants performed three of the six WM assessments
which took no longer than one hour.

Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using Net Station 4.5.4 (Electrical
Geodesics Inc., Eugene, OR). Upon completion of preprocessing and averaging, ERPs were computed for each
individual for each experimental condition for a 1500 ms
interval time-locked to the presentation of the critical verb
(“showed” above) relative to a 200 ms pre-stimulus baseline.
The following time windows were considered in the analysis
of P600 effects: 300-500, 500-700 and 700-900 ms. The
analyses were performed on midline and dorsal electrodes.
The midline electrodes were divided into anterior (FPZ, AFZ,
FZ, FCZ, CZ) and posterior (CPZ, 90, PZ, POZ, OZ)
sections. The dorsal electrodes were grouped by anteriorposterior (AP) location and hemisphere: Left anterior (FP1,

AF3, F1, F3, FC3, C3), right anterior (FP2, AF4, F2, F4, FC4,
C3), left posterior (CP3, CP1, P1, P3, P1, PO3, O1) and right
posterior (CP4, CP1, P4, P2, PO4, O2).
Sentence type effects in the ERP data were assessed in the
dorsal regions with multiple three-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) (sentence type (Type) x anterior-posterior (AP) x
hemisphere) and in the midline electrodes with a two-way
ANOVA (Type x AP).
In order to examine the possibility of qualitatively distinct
electrophysiological effects across participants, we used
Tanner and Van Hell (2014)’s RDI to sort participants into
negativity and positivity dominant groups. First, N400 and
P600 effect magnitudes for the garden-path/control contrast
were calculated using the same parameters as Tanner and Van
Hell (p. 293). N400 (control minus garden-path) and P600
effect magnitudes (garden-path minus control) were
calculated in the 300-500 and 500-800 ms time windows,
respectively, in a centro-parietal ROI (C3, CZ, C4, CP1, CP2,
P3 PZ, P4). RDI was calculated for each sentence type using
Tanner and Van Hell’s formula:
RDI

P600GP - P600Control - N400Control - N400GPl
√2

To examine the impact of RDI on comprehension accuracy,
participants were divided into groups according to response
dominance (N400 or P600). An analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) was run with garden-path comprehension
accuracy as the dependent variable, RDI group as the
independent variable and average, standardized WM score
(average z-score for the three measures) and mean accuracy
for positive lures in the 2-back task covariates. All outliers in
the behavioral data (±2.5 SDs from the sample mean) were
excluded from the analysis.

Results
Behavioral Data
Accuracy for garden-path sentences (M = 68.3%, SD = 14.4)
was significantly lower than control sentences (M = 73.6%,
SD = 11.4; F(1,36) = 6.13, p < .05, ηp2 = .15).
Mean accuracy for the operation span, reading span, and
symmetry span was 52.7 (SD = 15.9), 40.0 (SD = 15.9), and
21.1 (SD = 11.4), respectively. Analysis of the complex span
tasks showed significant correlations between all three (all rs
> .35, ps < .05, n = 35), as was expected (Kane, Conway,
Miura & Colflesh, 2007). Mean accuracy on n+1 and n+2
lures in the 2-back task was 65.3% (SD = 27.6) and 75.9%
(SD = 28.0), respectively. There were no significant
correlations between accuracy in the lure conditions and
complex span performance. This lack of correlation is
consistent with previous findings (Kane, et al., 2007;
Unsworth, Schrock, & Engle, 2004) and supports the finding
that n-back and complex span tasks are indexing separate
attentional mechanisms.

ERP Data
Garden-path sentences (compared to controls) showed a
significant interaction of Type and AP over midline sites in
the 500-700 and 700-900 ms time windows (F(1,36) = 4.18,
p < .05, ηp2 = .10 and F(1,36) = 6.02, p < .05, ηp2 = .14,
respectively) such that garden-paths elicited greater positivity
than control sentences over posterior sites. Simple
comparisons showed significant effects of type in posterior
areas in both the 500-700 (F(1,36) = 4.14, p < .05, ηp2 = .10)
and 700-900 time windows (F(1,36) = 4.93, p < .05, ηp2 =
.12). There were no effects in the anterior sites.

RDI Analysis

there was a main effect of Type in the 500-700 ms time
window (F(1,18) = 4.42, p = .05, ηp2 = .20) and a significant
interaction of Type and AP in the 700-900 ms window
(F(1,18) = 4.82, p < .05, ηp2 = .21), such that garden-paths
elicited greater positivity over posterior sites.
A mixed factors ANOVA on the comprehension accuracy
data with Type as a within participants factor and RDI group
as a between participants factor showed a main effect of Type
(F(1,35) = 7.02, p < .05, ηp2 = .17) and an interaction of Type
and group (F(1,36) = 4.50, p < .05, ηp2 = .11) (see Figure 2).
The interaction was driven by a simple effect of Type in the
N400 dominant group only (F(1,17) = 7.56, p < .05, ηp2 =
.31).

Analysis of N400 and P600 effect magnitudes for garden path
sentences showed a strong negative correlation (r(32) = -.90;
p < .001; see Figure 1). The data suggest a continuum
between strongly N400 and P600 dominant. Participants
were divided into groups based on RDI values (negative
values indicating N400 dominance and positive indicating
P600 dominance). A total of 18 participants were N400
dominant and 19 were P600 dominant.

The effect of sentence type for each group was examined
in three ERP data windows: 300-500, 500-700, and 700-900
ms. In N400 dominant participants there was a main effect of
Type over dorsal areas in the 300-500 (F(1,17) = 32.0, p <
.001, ηp2 = .65), the 500-700 (F(1,17) = 37.2, p < .001, ηp2 =
.69), and the 700-900 ms windows (F(1,17) = 27.4, p < .001,
ηp2 = .62), such that garden-paths were more negative. There
were also interactions of Type and AP in the 500-700
(F(1,17) = 4.42, p = .05, ηp2 = .21) and the 700-900 ms
windows (F(1,17) = 5.87, p < .05, ηp2 = .26) with greater
negativity at posterior sites.
For P600 dominant participants there was a main effect of
Type over dorsal sites for all windows: 300-500 (F(1,18) =
7.60, p < .05, ηp2 = .30), 500-700 (F(1,18) = 19.2, p < .001,
ηp2 = . 52) and 700-900 (F(1,18) = 21.2, p < .001, ηp2 = .54),
such that garden-paths were more positive. Over midline sites

The fact that the P600 dominant group showed reduced
garden-path effects in the accuracy data strongly suggests
that the individual differences factor captured by the RDI is
WM, or at least strongly related to WM, as individuals with
greater WMC often show reduced garden-path effects in
comprehension (Friederici et al., 1998). This question is
addressed in the ANCOVA; the method was discussed prior
in the data analysis section.
Prior to running the ANCOVA, it was necessary to
determine that the covariates affected the dependent variable
equally across the two groups. In the entire sample, there was
a significant correlation between average complex span score
and garden-path comprehension accuracy (r(32) = .52, p <
.01), with each RDI group showing positive correlations
(N400 dominant, r(14) = .63; P600 dominant, r(16) = .48)
between the two variables. Using a Fisher transformation
(Fisher, 1915), the difference between the group correlations
was not significant (z = .6, p > .50). Similarly, mean positive
2-back lure accuracy correlated positively with garden-path
comprehension accuracy (r(33) = .38, p < .05). Each group
showed positive correlations (N400 dominant, r(15) = .42;
P600 dominant, r(16) = .35), but the difference was not
significant (z = .2, p > .4).
The ANCOVA showed a significant effect of response
dominance on GP comprehension accuracy after controlling
for RDI (F(1,29) = 4.21, p < .05, ηp2 = .13) such that the P600
dominant group had greater accuracy. Complex span
performance accounted for a significant amount of variance

1754

(F(1,29) = 13.6, p < .05, ηp2 = .32), as did accuracy for
positive 2-back lures (F(1,29) = 5.28, p < .05, ηp2 = .15).

Discussion
The current study found evidence of distinct neural response
profiles which were not apparent in the grand averaged data
in neurologically normal, native English speakers during the
processing of garden-path sentences and this individual
differences measure predicted comprehension performance.
As in Tanner and Van Hell (2014), the N400 and P600
effect magnitudes fell into a continuous distribution and had
a significant negative correlation (r = -.90). This correlation
was greater than those found by Tanner and Van Hell for
agreement and tense violations (rs = -.59 & -.60,
respectively). An effect comparison using the Fisher
transformation reveals that the correlation found in the
current study was significantly greater than those in Tanner
& Van Hell (2014) (all ps < .05). This discrepancy may
suggest that response dominance is more pronounced or
polarized in processing well-formed but challenging
sentences (observed here) than that associated with syntactic
violations (observed in Tanner & Van Hell).
The grand average data showed a standard P600 effect
(increased positivity over posterior midline sites between 500
and 900 ms for the disambiguating word in garden-path
sentences, in absence of early effects) which is consistent
with the extant literature (Gouvea et al., 2010). When
participants were divided into groups according to response
dominance, N400 dominant individuals showed initial
increased negativity followed by posterior negativity. P600
dominants showed a similar, but instead positive, pattern with
increased positivity followed by later posterior positivities. In
contrast to Tanner and Van Hell (2014), there were no clear
topographical distinctions in the ERPs elicited by N400 and
P600 individuals. The posterior effects in the N400 dominant
group are in dorsal areas while in the P600 group they are in
the midline. This does represent a topographical difference
but, given that participants were sorted based on effect
polarity over posterior dorsal and midline areas, it is not
possible to make conclusions about qualitative differences in
sentence type effects. The analysis of each group’s ERPs
confirms what was indicated in the correlational analysis:
roughly half of the participants showed positivities while half
showed negativities.
The ERPs do, however, shed light on the previously
described instances of variability associated with garden-path
resolution. Lack of P600 effects (Mecklinger, et al. 1995) and
variable early effects (Friederici, et al., 2001; Gouvea, et al.,
2010; Horberg, et al., 2013; Matzke, et al., 2002) could be the
result of differing proportions of N400 and P600 dominant
participants in the sample. In the current sample, 51% of
participants were P600 dominant and 49% were N400
dominant and there were no early effects in the grand average
analysis.
The key finding of the current study is the effect of
response dominance on behavioral performance. Response

dominance emerged as an effective predictor of
comprehension accuracy such that P600 dominant
participants had better comprehension accuracy for gardenpath sentences. The results of the ANCOVA show that
response dominance is not a proxy for WMC but rather a
distinct individual difference measure. While WMC as
assessed with both complex span and the n-back tasks, two
tasks known to tap different aspects of attention control
(Kane, et al., 2007; Unsworth et al., 2004), did contribute
towards the successful recovery from temporary syntactic
ability, this contribution was distinct from that of response
dominance. This suggests that cognitive capacity alone does
not limit the individual’s ability to resolve garden-paths.
Response dominance may, instead, indicate the engagement
of specific parsing strategies.
Due to the ERP effect durations, the negativities in the
N400 group are not canonical N400s, nor are the P600
group’s positivities canonical P600s, thus interpreting them
as such requires caution. That being said, the N400 is mostly
associated with lexico-semantic processing and prediction
(Kutas, Van Petten & Kluender 2006; Kutas & Federmeier,
2011) while the P600 is associated with combinatorial,
syntactic processing (Gouvea, et al. 2010; O’Rourke & Van
Petten, 2011). Applying Tanner and Van Hell’s (2014)
account for morphosyntactic violations to the current gardenpath results, dominance of late posterior positivity may
indicate an increased reliance on the combinatorial
processing during parsing and, therefore, P600 dominant
individuals would be in a better position to accurately
reanalyze syntactic structure. In contrast, N400 dominant
individuals may rely more on word-based predictions while
parsing sentences, creating shallow syntactic representations.
Failure to incorporate combinatorial syntactic information,
thus, leads to a reduced ability to restructure the initial
incorrect parse and increased likelihood of arriving at an
incorrect interpretation.
The results of the current study extend the utility of Tanner
and Van Hell (2014)’s RDI as an individual difference to a
different syntactic context which elicits the P600 (i.e. gardenpath sentences) showing that individuals in the sample
exhibited distinct response profiles (either N400 or P600
dominant). Furthermore, response dominance during online
sentence processing predicted offline comprehension and this
relationship could not be reduced to individual differences in
two aspects of WMC (storage/recall in the face of ongoing
processing and discarding/suppression of active but no longer
relevant information). While future research will reveal the
neurocognitive underpinnings of response dominance, the
findings of the current study establish this individual
difference measure as a means of predicting behavior from
neural activity.
