Error bars denote standard error of the mean.
   The mean RTs for each sentence region were comparable
to those observed in previous studies of relative clause
processing (e.g., Wells et al., 2009) and followed the same
general trajectory, with the greatest RTs observed in Region
3 at the critical main verb.
   The frequency of the multiword chunks that make up the
relative clause itself has previously been shown to affect
processing (Reali & Christiansen, 2007). We therefore
initially focused on mean RTs across Regions 1 and 2 (e.g.,
SR: attacked the senator vs. OR: the senator attacked),
following the hypothesis that chunking may serve to reduce
the computational demands involved in processing the
embedded clause material.
   In order to test the relationship between participants’
chunking performance in Exp. 1 and the self-paced reading
RTs, we first sought to gain an overall measure of chunking
ability. For this purpose, we focused on the difference in
performance between experimental and control items in
