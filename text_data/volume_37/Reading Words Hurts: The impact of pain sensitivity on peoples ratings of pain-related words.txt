Participants
189 participants took part in our survey. We only collected
responses from those 141 participants who completed the
survey. 10 further subjects had to be excluded from our
analysis because they were not German native speakers, and
data of another subject had to be dismissed because the
person stopped responding differentially after 25% of the
words were presented. Of the remaining 130 people, 70
were female, 18 years or older, with a mean age of 28.04
years (SD = 8.97). All subjects who participated in our
survey were recruited through the Ruhr University Bochum
and were mostly students. They were not reimbursed for
their participation, but among all participants who submitted
their email address, four book vouchers were drawn.
Stimuli
We assembled a list of 330 German pain words. All words

Arguably, fewer people are willing to state that they do not consider themselves to be pain sensitive than having a low pain
sensitivity. Nine subjects, who claimed not to know whether they were pain sensitive, were excluded from statistical analysis.
2  To test the influence of concept type on people’s pain rating we used 108 abstract words and 190 concrete words. We
deliberately excluded all concepts that have both conrete and abstract features, e.g. tyrant, foul.

correlation between pain sensitivity and ratings on the pain-relatedness of words, is due to the intermediate effect of imagination. Highly sensitive people
may be more prone than less sensitive individuals at imagining scenarios that are potentially associated with, or elicited by pain-related words, leading to
higher pain-association values for these words. Given the effect of pain-incompatible imagery as a distractor of pain, it seems at least plausible that pain-
compatible imagery would have the opposite effect, enhancing the perceived pain-relatedness of words.
