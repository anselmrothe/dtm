Measures
All participants were tested on an extended battery of well-
established neuropsychological tests assessing different
aspects of cognition. For the assessment of verbal abilities
the following tests were administered: the Boston Naming
Test (Kaplan, Goodglass, & Weintraub, 2001) was used as a
measure of confrontation naming; the Logical Memory
subscale (immediate and delayed recall) from the Wechsler
Memory Scale (Fourth Edition UK; Wechsler, 2010) was
used to assess verbal memory; verbal intelligence was
assessed with the Mill Hill Vocabulary Test (Raven, 1981).
For the assessment of visual-spatial abilities the following
tests were used: the Hooper Visual Organization Test
(Hooper, 1983); the Mental Rotation Task (Shepard &
Metzler, 1971); the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test                 Figure 1: Stimuli samples of the Spatial Naming Test
