Abstract
Building on earlier neuropsychological work, we adopted a
novel individual differences approach to examine the
relationship between spatial language and a wide range of
both verbal and nonverbal abilities. Three new measures were
developed for the assessment of spatial language processing:
spatial naming, spatial verbal memory, and verbal
comprehension in spatial perspective taking. Results from a
sample of young adults revealed significant correlations
between performance on the spatial language tasks and
performance on both the analogous (non-spatial) verbal
measures as well as on the (non-verbal) visual-spatial
measures. Visual-spatial abilities, however, were more
predictive of spatial language processing than verbal abilities.
Furthermore, results from a sample of older adults revealed
impairments in visual-spatial tasks and on spatial verbal
memory. The results support dual process accounts of
meaning, and provide further evidence of the close connection
between the language of space and non-linguistic visualspatial cognition.

Introduction
Our ability to use words to refer to physical entities and
relationships (e.g., spatial relations) is vital for managing
everyday activities and constitutes a core part of human
linguistic communication. The nature of the relationship
between language and the physical world has been a major
subject in cognitive science, leading to two approaches;
distributional models suggest that the meaning of a word is
based on how it is used within a language (Griffiths,
Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2007) whereas embodied
approaches propose that semantic representation is acquired
through experiencing and acting in the physical world
(Barsalou, 1999; Zwaan, 2004).

It has been suggested that experiential data are linked to
concrete terms from the physical world (e.g., tree), whereas
distributional models better describe rather abstract
representations (e.g., freedom; Andrews, Vigliocco, &
Vinson, 2009). Spatial language, however, forms a natural
linkage between linguistic and perceptual representations.
Previous research has revealed a strong connection between
linguistic and non-linguistic representations of space, across
behavioural (e.g., Coventry, Griffiths, & Hamilton, 2014;
Hayward & Tarr, 1995), cross-linguistic (e.g., Munnich,
Landau, & Dosher, 2001), and neuroimaging (e.g.,
Noordzij, Neggers, Ramsey, & Postma, 2008)
investigations. On the other hand, evidence from studies
with atypical populations suggests that these two types of
representation are more distantly related. For example, there
have been reports of relatively preserved aspects of spatial
language production in descriptions of motion events in
children with William’s syndrome, a neurodevelopmental
condition characterized by deficits in spatial cognition
(Landau & Zukowski, 2011). Furthermore, lesion studies
have reported a double dissociation between spatial
language and spatial abilities (Tranel & Kemmerer, 2004),
suggesting that the meanings of spatial words are languagespecific semantic structures which are to some extent
independent
from
the
nonlinguistic
perceptual
representation (Kemmerer & Tranel, 2000).
Data exists to support both symbolic and grounded
theories of meaning, however, seldom have these competing
approaches been considered simultaneously within the same
paradigm. Some researchers are currently adopting an
integrative view according to which language processing
involves both symbolic and embodied representations
(Andrews et al., 2009). Connell and Lynott (2010) propose
an embodied conceptual combination model in which a
representation of knowledge integrates both linguistic

1518

distributional information and situated simulation. Evidence
from neuroscience also supports these hybrid accounts.
Accumulated findings yield shared neuronal circuits
between language and sensorimotor brain systems during
semantic learning of action- or perception-related words, but
common neuronal grounds have also been identified during
the processing of abstract words (Pulvermüller, 2012).
In this study we adopt a novel approach to investigate
whether spatial language (i.e., the use of words describing
spatial relations) is related to verbal vs nonverbal
visuospatial abilities or to both of them. This approach may
help us identify the relative extent to which each account
(symbolic vs grounded) contributes to spatial language
production, comprehension, and memory. Additionally,
taking into account the well-described age-related changes
in visuospatial cognition (Klencklen, Després, & Dufour,
2012), we further examine whether spatial language abilities
change in ageing. A simultaneous change in both spatial
language and non-verbal visuospatial abilities in older
adults would be suggestive of a close relation between these
two types of cognition.

Methods
Participants
Thirty-four healthy young adults (18-28 years old; 18
female) were recruited from the University of East Anglia
community, and 34 healthy older adults (61-81 years old; 18
female) were recruited from the local community.
Participants gave informed consent and received course
credits or monetary compensation for participation.
Participants who were non-English speakers and had a
neurological and/or psychiatric diagnosis or a learning
disability were excluded from the study. Testing took place
on an individual basis in one session lasting approximately
2 hours (including breaks when needed).

Edition UK; Wechsler, 2010). For a detailed description of
the measures see Lezak, Howieson, Bigler, & Tranel (2012).
In order to assess spatial language processing, we developed
three new tasks described below.
Spatial Naming Test. We developed the Spatial Naming
Test in order to assess confrontational naming abilities
specifically for static and dynamic spatial relations, as an
analog of the Boston Naming Test (Kaplan et al., 2001).
The stimuli consisted of thirty line drawn pictures of simple
geometrical shapes (Figure 1), and in particular a red ball as
the located object and an open cube as the reference object
(or more cubes when necessary, as in cases of between, in
the middle, among). Black balls were also depicted in order
to create a set of different spatial relationships in an attempt
to elicit the most suitable response for the target spatial
relation in a way that is distinguishable from the non-target
relations. Geometrical shapes were deliberately chosen
instead of everyday concrete objects in order to avoid biased
responses based on typical descriptions of commonly
encountered spatial relationships (e.g., ‘The cat is on the
mat’ or ‘The apple is in the bowl’). Each picture was
intended to correspond to a single English spatial
preposition, although in some cases more than one
preposition was appropriate (e.g., under, underneath,
below). Spatial prepositions were divided into two main
categories – locative/relational (15 items; see Figure 1,
samples A and B) and directional (15 items; see Figure 1,
samples C and D). Locative/relational prepositions are used
for static spatial relationships that describe the location of
one object in relation to another, whereas directional
prepositions are used in dynamic spatial relationships to
describe a change of position (Coventry & Garrod, 2004).

Measures
All participants were tested on an extended battery of wellestablished neuropsychological tests assessing different
aspects of cognition. For the assessment of verbal abilities
the following tests were administered: the Boston Naming
Test (Kaplan, Goodglass, & Weintraub, 2001) was used as a
measure of confrontation naming; the Logical Memory
subscale (immediate and delayed recall) from the Wechsler
Memory Scale (Fourth Edition UK; Wechsler, 2010) was
used to assess verbal memory; verbal intelligence was
assessed with the Mill Hill Vocabulary Test (Raven, 1981).
For the assessment of visual-spatial abilities the following
tests were used: the Hooper Visual Organization Test
(Hooper, 1983); the Mental Rotation Task (Shepard &
Metzler, 1971); the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test
(immediate and delayed recall; Osterrieth, 1944) was used
to assess visuospatial memory; nonlinguistic visuospatial
intelligence was assessed with the Matrix Reasoning
subscale from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Fourth

1519

Figure 1: Stimuli samples of the Spatial Naming Test
(A: near; B: on; C; into; D: through).

Participants were given one locative/relational example
and one directional, based on a viewer-centred frame of
reference. Next, they were asked to similarly name as
accurately as possible the location of the red ball in relation
to the cube in a way that it was differentiated from the black
balls’ location. Optimal responses were scored one point,
whereas a less accurate but not incorrect response was
scored as a half point.
Spatial Verbal Memory. Two novel stories were
developed, containing spatial information in an egocentric
(e.g., When he saw the Blue Lake in front of him, he turned
left) or an allocentric (e.g., The Gardens are nearby, located
to the left of the City Hall) frame of reference, respectively.
Each story contained 25 semantic units, similarly to the
Logical Memory subscale of the Wechsler Memory Scale
(Wechsler, 2010), 10 of which provided spatial information.
Participants were asked to repeat each story immediately
and after a 30 min delay.
Verbal Comprehension in Spatial Perspective Taking.
The VCSPT task was developed to assess verbal
comprehension under the absolute (environment-centred)
frame of reference (also see Levinson, 2003). The apparatus
consisted of a central circular board, on which the reference
object (a glass) was placed, surrounded by a rotating board
on which the located object (a ball) was placed (Figure 2).
An arrow pointing to the north was placed ~ 5 m away at an
angle of 45 degrees to the right of the participant’s position
(Figure 2). Participants were asked to judge as true or false
16 different statements of spatial relations between the
located and the reference object (e.g., The red ball is SW of
the glass).

condition in the Verbal Comprehension in Spatial
Perspective Taking task

Results
Correlations among all measures (data from younger adults,
aged 18-28) are presented in Table 1. All spatial language
measures were strongly correlated with nonverbal
intelligence (p < .05) but not with verbal intelligence (p >

.05). Moreover, spatial verbal memory positively correlated
with visual-spatial memory (p < .05; and with mental
rotation in the egocentric condition at p < .05), while spatial
verbal naming was positively correlated with all visualspatial measures (p < .05). However, positive correlations
were also revealed between each spatial language measure
and their analogous verbal measure. Spatial naming was
significantly correlated with Boston naming (p < .05), and
both egocentric and allocentric verbal memory with verbal
memory (p < .01 and p < .05, respectively). Finally, verbal
comprehension in the absolute frame of reference was
related only to non-verbal intelligence and the other spatial
language measures (p < .05), but not to any verbal abilities
(p > .05).
Further analyses took place in order to investigate
whether performance in verbal vs visuospatial measures
could predict performance in spatial language measures. All
verbal and non-verbal measures were submitted to an
exploratory factor analysis with principal axis factoring as
the extraction method with initial eigenvalues greater than 1
and oblimin rotation with Kaiser Normalization. Pattern
matrix loadings for the two-factor solution are presented in
Table 2. As expected, all language measures loaded strongly
onto Factor 1, whereas all non-verbal measures loaded onto
Factor 2. Consequently, the first factor was interpreted as
‘verbal abilities’ and the second one as ‘visual-spatial
abilities’, and both factors were extracted as two separate
variables.
Next, we applied multiple linear regression analysis using
Factor 1 (verbal abilities) and Factor 2 (visual-spatial
abilities) as predictors for our dependent variables (i.e.,
performance on each spatial language task). According to
the results, the visuospatial abilities factor predicted
performance of all novel spatial language measures (p <
.05), however, the verbal abilities factor alone did not (p >
.05). Table 3 presents the unstandardized and standardized
beta coefficient values along with their standard error
values. However, the combined model, including both
predictor variables, was significant for spatial language
measures, and more particularly for spatial naming [F(2, 31)
= 9.586, p < .001, R² = .382], egocentric [F(2, 31) = 8.385, p
< .001, R² = .351] and allocentric spatial verbal memory
[F(2, 31) = 3.524, p < .05, R² = .185], as well as for
language comprehension in the absolute frame of reference
[F(2, 31) = 3.304, p < .05, R² = .176]. Hence, the verbal
measures did not stand on their own but according to the
combined two-factor model they are still contributing to
spatial language processing.
Furthermore, we applied one-way analysis of variance,
with age as the between-subjects factor, in order to examine
possible differences between young and older adults in
spatial language processing, as well as verbal and visualspatial abilities. Older adults performed significantly worse
in all visual-spatial measures compared to younger adults.
More specifically, their performance was poorer in visualspatial reasoning [F(1, 66) = 8.322, p < .005] and memory
[delayed recall; F(1, 66) = p < .05], mental rotation [F(1,

1520

66) = 8.085, p < .01], and visual organization [F(1, 66) =
4.151, p < .05]. On the other hand, older adults
outperformed their younger counterparts in verbal
intelligence [F(1, 66) = 26.753, p < .001], as well as in
confrontation naming [F(1, 66) = 4.934, p < .05], while no
significant differences were found between the groups in
verbal memory (p > .05). Across spatial language measures,
significant differences between the two groups were
revealed in the delayed recall condition of both egocentric
[F(1, 66) = 6.473, p < .05] and allocentric [F(1, 66) = 4.301,
p < .05] spatial verbal memory tasks, with older adults
performing worse in both conditions. Older adults recalled
significantly less spatial information in both egocentric
[F(1, 66) = 7.782, p < .01] and allocentric [F(1, 66) =
12.277, p < .001] subscales. Performance of both groups in
all spatial language measures is presented in Figure 3.

Discussion
In the present study, we applied a novel approach using an
extended battery of both verbal and visual-spatial measures
within the same group of participants in order to investigate
their relation with spatial language production and
comprehension. More specifically, we developed three new
measures assessing 1) picture naming of static and dynamic
spatial relations, 2) verbal memory of spatial information
presented in an egocentric or an allocentric perspective, and
3) verbal comprehension in spatial perspective taking
(absolute frame of reference).
Our results revealed strong correlations between the novel
spatial language measures and both verbal and non-verbal
visual-spatial abilities. However, visual-spatial abilities
were found to be consistently more predictive of spatial
language processing than verbal measures. The ‘quasineuropsychological’ method adopted reveals simultaneously
the relative loadings of visuospatial and verbal components
on different aspects of spatial language processing for the
first time. Similarly, previous investigations of dual task
paradigms reported that both verbal and visuospatial
components of working memory are involved in the
memory of descriptions that contain spatial information
(Brunyé & Taylor, 2007; De Beni, Pazzaglia, Gyselinck, &
Meneghetti, 2005).
Furthermore, a comparison between a group of younger
and a group of older adults yielded significant differences in
verbal memory of spatial information presented either in an
egocentric or an allocentric frame of reference; in both cases
older adults retained less spatial information after a delayed
recall. This novel finding is suggestive of significant
alterations in aspects of verbal processing of spatial
information across adulthood. Group comparisons revealed
that young adults performed better than older adults in
visual-spatial measures, while on the contrary, older adults
outperformed younger adults in linguistic measures. These
findings are consistent with previous reports of a decline in
2

spatial cognition in ageing (for a review, see Klencklen,
Després, & Dufour, 2012) while linguistic processing
(particularly semantic and word knowledge) remains
relatively intact (Burke & Shafto, 2008). Taking into
account the age differences in visual-spatial cognition when
considering the present finding of age-related differences in
spatial verbal memory suggests that (non-verbal) grounded
representations are indeed critical in spatial language
processing. However, both groups of older and younger
adults performed equally on tasks of spatial naming and
verbal comprehension in perspective taking. This finding
further supports the idea that linguistic (symbolic) and nonlinguistic (embodied / grounded) representations of space
map onto each other, at least to some extent, and that both
types of representation contribute to spatial language
processing.
Recent neuroimaging investigations have demonstrated
that spatial language (and spatial prepositions in particular)
is mainly supported by frontal and parietotemporal areas of
the left hemisphere whereas the right hemisphere has a key
role in nonverbal schematic representation of space
(Amorapanth et al., 2012; Göksun, Lehet, Malykhina, &
Chatterjee, 2013). Despite differences in the neural and
mental organization of linguistic and nonlinguistic
representations of space, however, these two domains seem
to interact (Chatterjee, 2001), and our results provide further
evidence for this close relationship. Processing of locative
prepositions has been associated with increased activation in
left inferior parietal areas, independent of the context (visual
vs verbal) in which the prepositions are presented,
suggesting a flexible representation of space in both
linguistic and nonlinguistic visuo-spatial modalities
(Noordzij, Neggers, Ramsey, & Postma, 2008).
Despite the fact that symbolic and embodied approaches
of meaning have been studied independently of each other,
with evidence typically being separately presented for each
theoretical line, more recent views propose an integration of
the two approaches (Andrews et al., 2009; Lynott &
Connell, 2010). Our study provides experimental evidence
to further support the idea that effective processing of
lexical constructions, and more specifically of words
referring to spatial relations, require both symbolic and
grounded representations. However, our findings suggest a
greater loading of spatial language processing onto visualspatial cognition. Additional investigations that adopt this
novel approach and methodology are required in order to
draw stronger conclusions. Furthermore, cross-sectional
studies, sampling across adult lifespan, may shed light on
the rate of age-related changes in spatial language abilities
and provide more information regarding the role that verbal
and non-linguistic visual-spatial abilities might have on this
process.
