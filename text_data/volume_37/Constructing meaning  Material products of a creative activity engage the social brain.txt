channel head coil to acquire the T2* weighted gradient

Level-Dependent (BOLD) contrast using the following
parameters: echo time (TE): 30 ms, repetition time (TR):
3000 ms, and a flip angle of 90°. Whole-brain images were
obtained over fifty-six sequential, interleaved 2.5 mm axial
slices with a 3 x 3 mm resolution and a field of view of 192

All fMRI data analyses were conducted using SPM8
