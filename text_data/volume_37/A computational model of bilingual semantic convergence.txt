name agreement have stronger object-name associations and
more robust representations. The same object could have a
different degree of name agreement across languages and
result in different level of robustness and entrenchment.
Zinszer et al. found that the name agreement level in both
the first and second language plays an important role in L2
naming patterns. Learner characteristics such as age of
immersion also mattered, suggesting complex dynamic
interactions underlying the acquisition of L2 patterns in
object naming.
  The study of the dynamic interactions in a lexical network
lends itself naturally to connectionist representation and
computational modeling. We can think of the lexical
network in terms of a conceptual representation that
includes features, exemplars, and associations rather than
