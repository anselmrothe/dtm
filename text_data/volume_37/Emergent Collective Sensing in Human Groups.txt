Figure 6: Reconstructions of actual gameplay in a five-person group illustrating both failed exploration leading to intelligent
copying and successful exploration leading to collective movement. Colors indicate the individuals’ scores, with red being
higher and orange/yellow being lower. The player labels indicate both player IDs and also the player states our feature extraction
procedure inferred. Other annotations are provided to give a sense for the game dynamics. At 34 seconds, in the first panel,
most of the group has converged on exploiting a particular area while one individual is exploring independently. To the right, at
36 seconds, the exploring individual appears to have failed to find a good location and ceases exploring by copying the group.
At 40 seconds, the final panel in the first row, the score field has shifted and some of the group begins exploring while others
continue to exploit. By 49 seconds, the first panel in the second row, one of the exploring individuals found a good location,
and other players have begun to move towards that individual. At 54 seconds, the entire group is exploiting the new area. In
the final panel, at 55 seconds, the background has shifted enough again that one of the individuals begins to explore.
