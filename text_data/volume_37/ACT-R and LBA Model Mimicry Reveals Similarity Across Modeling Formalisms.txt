   We addressed three primary questions in this research.
First, can both ACT-R and LBA generate the complete RT
profiles, including false starts and lapses, observed in PVT
studies? ACT-R models have predominantly been used to
predict mean RTs, and attempts to account for full RT
distributions have been rare (but see Walsh et al., 2014).
The LBA has only been used to model the correct and error
responses in multi-alternative choice tasks (Brown &
Heathcote, 2008), and it was unclear whether it could also
account for the full response profile observed in the PVT,
especially the occurrence of false starts and lapses. Second,
