2005; Slobin, 2006). The latter sentence is somewhat
ambiguous - we can both push the table (means) and
break the table (outcome). Critically though, there is a
strong association across languages between transitive
sentences and causal (outcome) verbs, even though
English allows for a wide range of verbs in this
sentence context (Levin & Rappaport Hovav, 2005).
This typological association suggests that a link
between transitivity and outcome semantics may be
especially robust.
