possible when the target occurred by pressing a button. Note
that participants were given no prior knowledge of the
predictor-target statistical contingencies, or even that there
was a distinction among the different stimulus types.
Instead, as was observed by Jost et al. (2015), the participant
was expected to learn the predictor - target relationship
(hereafter referred to as SL).
   Each predictor condition (HP and LP) was presented 50
times. All sequence trials were continuous and randomly
ordered across the two probability conditions, so that
participants could not distinguish the onset or offset of one
trial from another. Each participant was presented with a
total of 100 trials (5 blocks of 20 trials each). A break of 30
seconds was given between each block.
