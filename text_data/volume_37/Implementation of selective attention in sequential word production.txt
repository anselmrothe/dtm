calculated by dividing the raw error counts by the total
opportunities for error on each word. Given the overall
decrease in error probability on the attended word in the
experimental condition reported by Nozari and Dell (2012),
we tested the competing hypotheses of no change or a
reliable decrease of anticipations, perseverations or both.
Attention led to a significant decrease in perseveration
errors (t(59) = 1.79, p = 0.039) and a marginal decrease in
anticipations (t(59), p = 0.051). Next we use the model to
develop competing accounts of what attention does, and
compare those accounts to the empirical data.
Simulations
Simulating performance in the control condition (the
baseline model). Before different hypotheses were tested, a
baseline model was needed to capture the data pattern in the
control condition without manipulation of attention. A
model with the following parameters well captured this

   Nozari and Dell (2012) presented a preliminary analysis
of origin for errors on the unattended words that supported
the contention that the segments from the attended words
were not more likely to migrate to the unattended words.
However, they included all errors (anticipatory errors,
perseveratory errors, and exchanges) in counting errors
whose origin was the attended word. Also, they included
every error whose origin could potentially be the attended
word in the analysis. The current experiment tested a more
specific hypothesis predicted by the model that provided the
best fit to the error data on attended words. Specifically, the
model predicts no increase in the proportion of
perseveration errors on the words following the attended
word. The strongest demonstration of this should be on the         Figure 3- Proportion of AttOrg+ and AttOrg− perseveration
