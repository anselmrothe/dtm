Abstract
We studied changes to the pattern of speech errors as a
function of selectively attending to one word in a sequence to
learn how attention is implemented in language production.
Three hypotheses were tested: (1) attention specifically
inhibits the past, (2) attention enhances the activation of the
present without affecting the past or the future, and (3)
attention decreases priming of the future. In Experiment 1,
using a model of sequential word production, we simulated
the pattern of anticipatory and perseveratory errors on the
attended words, and compared them to empirical error data.
Our findings support a model in which attention only affects
the present. Experiment 2 tested the prediction of this model
regarding the error patterns on the word following the
attended word. These results were also compatible with a
transient enhancement in the activation of present that does
not affect the production of the future words.

Introduction
We can selectively attend to certain objects in the visual
scene while ignoring others. As a consequence we process
the attended objects more accurately, at a cost to objects we
choose not to attend to. The mechanisms behind this
selective attention are well studied in perception, and range
from competition for representations in the receptive field of
individual neurons to synchronization of neural populations
mediated by a fronto-parietal control network that lies
largely outside of sensory regions (Gazzaley & Nobre,
2012). On the other hand, selective attention in selfproduced sequences, such as multi-word utterances, is less
well understood, and is the topic of the current study.
There are at least two fundamental differences between
selective attention during language production and during
visual perception. For one, words that are not placed in the
focus of selective attention must still be fully processed for
production. For example, even though the speaker may be

attending to “three” in “I have been here for three hours” in
response to an interlocutor who tells him “You have only
been waiting for an hour”, he must still plan and produce all
the other words that are not in special focus of attention.
Furthermore, the sequence unfolds over time, so
competition must be implemented in a system with temporal
sequencing. These differences motivate the direct study of
the effects of selective attention on production of multiword utterances, instead of relying strongly on
extrapolations from visual attention.
Effects of attention on language production remain, for
the most part, unstudied. Most research that looks at
attention in the context of speaking is, in essence, studying
attention in visual perception, rather than attention in
production. For example, many studies have shown that the
focus of attention on the visual scene predicts the utterance
structure (e.g., Griffin & Bock, 2000), and that manipulating
bottom-up attention within the scene affects the choice of
linguistic structure (e.g., Bock, Irwin, & Davidson, 2004;
Gleitman, January, Nappa, & Trueswell, 2007; Tomlin,
1997; but see Kuchinsky, Bock, & Irwin, 2011). Similarly,
research on the effects of attention on suppressing
competing pictures/words during picture naming speaks to
inhibition of a perceptual competitor that is not to be
produced (e.g., Oppermann, Jescheniak, & Görges, 2013;
Piai, Roelofs, & Schriefers, 2012). While informative about
how information is selected for production, none of these
studies address the consequences of paying special attention
to, say, one word in a sequence of words all of which are to
be produced.
Nozari and Dell (2012) presented the first empirical study
of the effect of selective attention on the production of
multi-word utterances. Participants produced 4-word
tongue-twisters in which either one or none of the words
was singled out. Three different manipulations of attention
all resulted in the same pattern: selective attention during
production resulted in the more accurate production of the
attended and less accurate production of the unattended (see

1745

also Nozari & Thompson-Schill, 2013 for linking this effect
to the left prefrontal cortex). To investigate the underlying
mechanism of this effect, Nozari and Dell (2012) reported
an analysis of the origin of errors. They divided errors on
the unattended words into two groups. The first group were
errors which originated from the attended word (AttOrg+;
e.g., producing “ring” for “wing”, where the origin of the
erroneous segment /r/ was the attended word “wrist”). The
rest were errors that did not originate from the attended
word (AttOrg−; e.g., producing “winf” for “wing”, where
the origin of the erroneous segment /f/ was not the attended
word “wrist”). The authors found no evidence of increase in
the proportion of AttOrg+ errors as a function of attention.
They argued that this finding ruled out the simplest
implementation of attention, in which the attended word is
given a large jolt of activation, because the extra activation
should have caused more segmental migrations from the
attended word and increased the proportion of AttOrg+
errors.
While Nozari and Dell’s finding refuted one model, it
remained unclear what the correct way of implementing
attention in language production is. The present study
investigates this issue in sequential word production. Except
for the first and the last words in multi-word utterances,
every other word is spoken amid both past and future words.
Fluent and error-free production depends on successful
inhibition of the past, correct selection of the present, and
timely priming of the future. Failure of any of these
operations results in erroneous or disfluent speech. Poor
inhibition of the past or failure to activate the present can
result in perseveration errors, errors in which the alreadyspoken words, or parts of them, are repeated in place of the
current target. Disproportionally strong priming of the
future leads to anticipation errors, where the words, or parts
of them, that must be uttered in the future slip into the
production of the current utterance. Finally, late or impotent
priming of the future results in disfluent speech. Selective
attention may modulate any of these processes.
The current study uses a computational model to test
whether selective attention affects the suppression of the
past, the activation of the present, or the priming of the
future. The model is a modified version of a model of serial
order in language production proposed by Dell, Burger, and
Svec (1997; Figure 1). The goal of the simulations is not to
test the model, but rather to use it to understand attention, in
much the same way that, for example, a signal detection
model is used to understand the effect of some manipulation
on recognition memory or perception. The model offers
parameters, variation in each of which may or may not be
able to explain the effects of attention on the data.
Dell et al.’s (1997) model has two main components, a
plan for the words to be produced and a structural frame for
ordering these words. The plan has connections to all lexical
items relevant to the current sequence with equal weight w.
This means that these words can be activated and selected
through the plan, but there is no information about which

word has to be produced first, second, etc. Ordering is
achieved through binding with the structural frame.
Unlike the plan, the structural frame is not specific to
words in the current sequence. Instead, it supports activation
of words in certain positions. Figure 1 shows an example, in
which it is time to produce a word in position 2. While all
weights between the plan and the words remain w, the
structural frame differentially supports the activation of
words in positions 1, 2, and 3. Word 1 (past) receives no
support from the frame (i.e., weight = 0) because it has
already been produced. Word 2 (present) receives support
with weight k. Word 3 (future) also receives some support
with weight b, because it needs to be primed for production
next. Specifically, the input of activation to the words in the
sequence is a function of the (uniform) support they receive
from the plan multiplied by the (differential) support they
receive from the structural frame. Two more parameters
affect this activation: passive decay (d), and active
suppression after production, which we index by residual
activation given to each word once it has been produced (c).
The activation of past, present, and future after retrieval has
gone on for n time steps is (Equations 1-3):
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡) = 𝑐𝑐(1 − 𝑑𝑑)𝑛𝑛
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝) = 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛(1 − 𝑑𝑑)(𝑛𝑛−1)
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓) = 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛(1 − 𝑑𝑑)(𝑛𝑛−1)

interest (past, present or future), and μ is the parameter
indicating how rapidly the strength of the word i grows as a
competitor with its increasing activation. Empirically, the
consequence of the different levels of activation of past,
present, future is reflected in the proportion of anticipation
and perseveration errors. Following Luce’s choice axiom,
the probability of selecting a word is proportional to the
ratio of that word’s activation to the sum of activation of all
words competing for selection (Equation 4):
𝑃𝑃(𝑖𝑖) =

∑𝑗𝑗1 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑗𝑗)

where j is the total number of words in the sequence 1. Thus,
the higher the activation of the past relative to the total
activation, the higher the chance of its selection, which
would manifest as a perseveration error. The same goes for
present and future, manifesting as correct responses and
anticipation errors respectively.
Three hypotheses about the influence of attention are
tested:
1) Attention helps inhibit the past (c).
2) Attention helps activate the present (k).
3) Attention decreases the activation of future (b).

The fourth word in the sequence was given a constant small
amount of activation (0.01) and was included in the denominator
as a potential, but weak, competitor.

Note that we only considered hypotheses that were
compatible with the main finding of Nozari and Dell (2012),
namely that increased attention should increase accuracy of
the attended word. For example, we did not test increased
priming of future, because it would have meant less
accuracy on the attended word, as strong future priming
increases the chance of the future word to be produced in
place of the present word.
Two experiments are reported. Experiment 1 investigates
the effects of selective attention on the pattern of
anticipation and perseverations on the attended word itself.
Experiment 2 studies the consequence of selectively
attending to a word on errors on the word immediately
following the attended word.

Experiment 1
Methods
Empirical data
Data were re-analyzed from sixty individuals who had
participated in Experiments 1 and 2 in Nozari and Dell
(2012). Participants were exposed to 64 four-word tonguetwisters, such as “wrist wing whiff rink”. In the control
condition, they rehearsed the tongue-twisters four times at
the rate of 2 words/s, and then produced them four times
from memory at the rate of 3 words/s. In the experimental
condition, one of the four words (each position equally
likely) was printed in bold and was underlined during the
rehearsal phase. This was the attended word. Experiment 1
instructed participants to especially avoid making errors on

words (unattended) in comparison to the control condition
where no word was attended. Specifically, the error rate on
the attended word in the experimental condition (e.g., “wrist
wing whiff rink”) were compared to that on the word in the
similar position in a sibling tongue-twister (e.g., “mist wing
whiff mink”) in the control condition (the appearance of
sibling tongue-twisters in the experimental and control
conditions was counterbalanced across participants). The
control word in the latter will be referred to as the
“attended” to distinguish it from the three other words in the
sequence, although in reality there was no difference
between the four words in the control sequences.
For the purpose of the current study, the data were recoded for anticipation and perseveration errors. A graduate
student with linguistics background, trained in speech error
coding, coded the errors according to the rules in Dell et al.
(1997), and the coding was double-checked by the first
author. Six categories of errors were coded: Word
Anticipation (WA), Word Perseveration (WP), Sound
Anticipation (SA), Sound Perseveration (SP), Exchanges
(E), and Others (O). Errors were coded only on words in
positions 2 and 3, because these were the only positions for
which both anticipation and perseveration were possible.
Anticipations were coded as producing whole (WA) or parts
(SA) of upcoming words in place of the present utterance.
For example, if participant produced “wrist wing wink rink”
instead of the target sequence “wrist wing whiff rink”, the
error “wink” would receive the SA code. Conversely, if
whole (WP) or parts (SP) of the words that had already been
spoken re-appeared in the present utterance, a perseveration
error was coded. For example, the error “wist” in “wrist wist
whiff rink” would receive the SP code. Some errors had
ambiguous origins, such as “ring” in “wrist ring whiff rink”,
which may be a perseveration from the /r/ in “wrist”, or an
anticipation of the /r/ in “rink”. These errors were coded as
Others and were not included in the analyses. Exchanges
(e.g., “wrist whiff wing rink”) were also excluded, as they
contributed equally to anticipation and perseveration errors
if they were to be counted as such.

participants to explicitly emphasize the word. As explained

Table 1 shows the number of each error type on the
attended words collapsed across positions 2 and 3 for the
experimental and control conditions. To have enough
statistical power for comparing anticipations and
perseverations, word and sound errors were combined. The
upper left panel in Figure 2 shows error proportions on the
attended word for anticipation and perseveration errors in
control and experimental conditions. Proportions were
calculated by dividing the raw error counts by the total
opportunities for error on each word. Given the overall
decrease in error probability on the attended word in the
experimental condition reported by Nozari and Dell (2012),
we tested the competing hypotheses of no change or a
reliable decrease of anticipations, perseverations or both.
Attention led to a significant decrease in perseveration
errors (t(59) = 1.79, p = 0.039) and a marginal decrease in
anticipations (t(59), p = 0.051). Next we use the model to
develop competing accounts of what attention does, and
compare those accounts to the empirical data.

Model 3 – Decreased priming of the future. Perhaps
attention works by preventing the speaker from focusing too
far ahead. This hypothesis was tested by decreasing b. Once
a level b was determined that best captured the rate of
anticipation errors, the model’s performance was evaluated
by determining its estimated rate of perseverations. The
model predicted a slight increase from 3.6% to 3.7% in the
rate of perseverations (Figure 2, bottom right panel).

Simulations
Simulating performance in the control condition (the
baseline model). Before different hypotheses were tested, a
baseline model was needed to capture the data pattern in the
control condition without manipulation of attention. A
model with the following parameters well captured this
pattern w = 0.5, d = 0.5, c = 0.45, b = 0.35, k = 1, n = 3, and
μ = 10 The parameters of the baseline model were then kept
constant across the three simulations, except for a single
parameter in each simulation that attention was
hypothesized to influence. This parameter was changed to
simulate the change to error proportions between the control
and experimental conditions.

simulated models of the effect of selective attention on the
proportion of Anticipation (A) and Perseveration (P) errors
on the attended word in the experimental and control
conditions.

Results and Discussion
Model 1- Increased inhibition of the past. According to this
hypothesis, attention acts by strongly inhibiting the past
word, hence decreasing the probability of perseverations on
the present (attended) word. The residual activation of the
past after suppression is captured by parameter c in the
model. We decreased c to a level where the model’s
predicted proportion of perseverations in the attended
condition matched the empirical data. The critical test of the
model’s performance then comes from its prediction about
the anticipations given the same parameters. This model
predicted a slight increase in the proportion of anticipation
errors from 7.6% to 7.7% (Figure 2, top right panel).
Model 2 – Increased activation of the present. This model
tested the hypothesis that attention enhances the activation
of the present but does not directly affect the activation of
the past or the future. To simulate this, parameter k was
increased to the level that the model would accurately
capture the rate of perseveration errors. The test of the
model was its prediction of the rate of Anticipations given
the same set of parameters. The model predicted a drop
from 7.6% to 4.6% in the rate of these errors (Figure 2,
bottom left corner).

Our empirical data revealed a decrease in the rates of both
perseverations and anticipations on the attended words.
Models 1 and 3, which tested the effects of attention on past
and future respectively, each captured a drop in only one
error type, but predicted no decrease in the other error type.
If anything, a slight increase was predicted as a function of
the lower competition from the other error type that was
decreased (smaller denominator in Equation 4). The only
model that captured the drop in both anticipation and
perseveration errors was model 2 in which attention was
hypothesized to only affect the activation of the present and
not that of the past or the future. When tuned to mimic the
perseveration rate on the attended word in the empirical
data, this model predicts a drop of 3% in anticipation errors
on that word. The actual data showed a comparable 2.4%
drop. It thus seems that the effect of attention is best
captured by a model that narrows the focus of attention to
the object being currently processed, the result of which is a
decrease in the processing of both the past and future.

Results and Discussion

Experiment 2
Experiment 1 supported a model in which selective
attention was implemented by enhancing the activation of
the present. We implemented this by increasing the
connection weight between the present slot in the structural
frame and the word to be currently produced. This
implementation results in a transient effect. When the word
is linked to the “present” slot in the frame its activation is
boosted. As soon as it loses that link and becomes the past,
it has no advantage over another word that was not boosted.
If this characterization is correct, then the attended word, or
its segments, should be no more likely to infiltrate the
production of other words in the sequence.
Nozari and Dell (2012) presented a preliminary analysis
of origin for errors on the unattended words that supported
the contention that the segments from the attended words
were not more likely to migrate to the unattended words.
However, they included all errors (anticipatory errors,
perseveratory errors, and exchanges) in counting errors
whose origin was the attended word. Also, they included
every error whose origin could potentially be the attended
word in the analysis. The current experiment tested a more
specific hypothesis predicted by the model that provided the
best fit to the error data on attended words. Specifically, the
model predicts no increase in the proportion of
perseveration errors on the words following the attended
word. The strongest demonstration of this should be on the
word that immediately follows the attended word, because
even if the attended word has retained any of its extra
activation, this activation would decay over time, weakening
its effect as more words are produced.

Methods
The same set of data from Experiment 1 was used for new
coding and analyses. This time, we were interested in the
effect that attending to a word had on the words after the
attended word. The same attended words as Experiment 1
(words 2 and 3) were targeted, and the words immediately
after them (words 3 and 4 respectively) were analyzed. Two
types of perseveration errors were coded: (a) perseveration
errors originating from the attended word; for example, the
error “riff” in “wrist wing whiff riff” for the target “wrist
wing whiff rink” would be coded as a perseveration
originating from the attended word. We call these AttOrg+
errors. The second class were (b) perseveration errors
originating from the unattended word(s), for example, the
error “ring” in “wrist wing whiff ring” would be coded as a
perseveration originating from an unattended word. We call
these AttOrg− errors. Similar to Experiment 1, errors with
ambiguous origin were not included in the analyses.

In the experimental condition, there were 63 AttOrg+ and
31 AttOrg− perseveration errors. In the control condition,
there were 73 AttOrg+ and 21 AttOrg− perseveration errors.
Figure 3 shows the proportion of errors relative to
opportunities. As can be seen, there was no evidence for
more perseverations from the attended word onto the next
word in the experimental than the control condition. If
anything, there were numerically fewer such errors,
although the difference was not reliable (t(59) = 0.24 using
a two-tailed t-test on the error counts).

Figure 3- Proportion of AttOrg+ and AttOrg− perseveration
errors on the word immediately after the attended word
(collapsed over words 3 and 4), in the experimental and
control conditions.
Perhaps there are simply fewer perseveration errors on
words after the attended word in the experimental condition,
and this decrease does not really reflect anything about the
source of those errors. To test this, we compare this pattern
to the perseveration errors on the same words that originate
from the unattended words in the sequence. This was done
by looking at the difference between the AttOrg+ and
AttOrg− errors in the experimental and control conditions
(equivalent to an interaction analysis). A marginally
significant interaction between the pattern of errors was
found (t(59) = 0.06 using a two-tailed t-test). This shows
that the drop in the perseverations from the control to the
experimental condition is particular to the AttOrg+ errors.

General Discussion
In previous work, we had demonstrated that selectively
attending to one out of four words in a sequence increases
accuracy on that word, while decreasing accuracy on the
other words (Nozari & Dell, 2012). In this study, we
presented model-driven analyses of the error data, and three
simulations, in which attention was manipulated by (1)
more strongly suppressing the past, (2) more strongly
activating the present, and (3) less strongly priming the
future. Experiment 1 showed that the pattern of anticipation

1749

and perseveration errors on the attended word itself was
most compatible with the model in which attention
influenced the activation of the present (simulation 2).
Experiment 2 tested a further prediction of such a model, by
looking at the pattern of perseverations, this time on the
word following the attended word. If attention exerts a
transient influence on the present, as modeled in simulation
2 through a link to the structural frame, then there should be
no increase in the probability of the attended word to intrude
in the production of the following word.
In agreement with the results of Nozari and Dell (2012),
the current analysis found no evidence of increased
perseveration errors from a word that was previously in the
focus of attention on the word that was to be presently
produced. A follow-up analysis showed that this was not
due to a general drop in the perseveration errors on the
words following the attended word, but was a pattern
specific to those originating from the attended word itself.
Together, these results support a model in which attention is
implemented in the connections between the present slot in
a structural frame and the word to be presently spoken.
We close by briefly discussing one angle from which
these data can have a clinical impact. Perseveration errors
are common in individuals with brain damage (e.g., Albert
& Sandson, 1986; Fischer-Baum & Rapp, 2012), children
(e.g., Stemberger, 1989), and older adults (Foldi, HelmEstabrooks, Redfield, & Nickel, 2003). These are also
populations that usually have impaired cognitive control.
Often though, perseveration errors are viewed as related to
cognitive control if the problem is connected to suppression
of the past. While inhibition of the past is the cause of
perseverations for some individuals, Perseverations in others
have been shown to be due to insufficient activation of the
present (Fischer-Baum & Rapp, 2012). If selective attention
works by specifically enhancing the activation of the
present, methods that train selective attention might be the
key to abolishing perseveration errors in clinical
populations.
