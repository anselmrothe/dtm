these have generally been viewed as unique and
individualized representations (Kennedy, 1982; McCloud,
1993; Walker, 1980), possibly with metaphoric or embodied
meanings (Forceville, 2005, 2011; Kennedy, 1982; Slepian,
Weisbuch, Rutchick, Newman, & Ambady, 2010).
However, we have argued that many graphic signs extend
beyond individual instances, and instead belong to a class of
abstract schema stored in memory which uses combinatorial

specifically for these “above the head” meanings.
   Some work has recognized that the context and position
of visual morphemes matters for their interpretation (Cohn,
2007; Forceville, 2011; McCloud, 1993). For example,
