Methods
Participants Fifty-three U.S. children between the ages of 2

ipated in the study. Thirty-two children participated in the
dyad condition (M=4;10, range=2-8) and 17 children partic-
ipated in the solo condition (M=4;5, range=2-9). Four addi-
tional children were excluded due to shyness (n=2), speak-
ing the non-English language of the experimenter (n=1), and
session interruption (n=1).
