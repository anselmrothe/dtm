                      Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, children encountered a toy that, like
Bonawitz and Lombrozo’s (2012), had a fan and a light.
Children learned that one color coin turned on the fan (the
one-effect coin) and that the other color coin turned on
both the fan and light (the two-effect coin). After several
familiarization trials with these coins (in which various
parts of the toy were occluded), children were presented
with one test trial in which the light was occluded so that
they could not tell whether it was on or not. Then, one
coin was randomly and covertly put into the machine and
children were asked to infer which coin was placed inside.
The coin was drawn from a bag containing 5 coins of
each color, to ensure that the prior probabilities were
equal. If children respond normatively, they should guess
