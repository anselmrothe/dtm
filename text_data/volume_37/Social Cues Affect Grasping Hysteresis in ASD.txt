                                                            possible that in the presence of a social situation,
                                                            children of ASD actually focused more on the task

                                                            However, this is speculative, as no measurements that
                                                            could shed light on attentional focus (e.g., eye gaze)

                                                            was initially chosen because of the fact that to our
