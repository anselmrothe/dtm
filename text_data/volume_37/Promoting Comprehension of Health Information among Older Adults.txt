Abstract

difficulty understanding health information (e.g., Chin et al.,
2015). As self-care information proliferates on the web,
comprehension of this information is increasingly important
for self-care and inadequate comprehension among older
adults with low health literacy is a concern.
The Process-Knowledge Model of Health Literacy
suggests there are different cognitive components that are
related to the development of health literacy, including
processing capacity, general knowledge, and health
knowledge (Chin et al., 2011). These components have
different trajectories across the lifespan, with processing
capacity declining, while knowledge tends to sustain with
age (Beier & Ackerman, 2005; Baltes, 1997). These agerelated changes in component abilities may influence the
development of health literacy of older adults. However,
knowledge can compensate for the effect of the declining
processing capacity on health literacy (Chin et al., 2011).
Therefore, links between health literacy and comprehension
would depend on the interaction between processing
capacity and knowledge (Chin et al., under review).
Theories of comprehension suggest that knowledge can
offset the effects of processing capacity limits on
comprehension among older adults through different
reading strategies (e.g., Miller, Stine-Morrow, Kirkorian &
Conroy, 2004). Processing capacity and knowledge jointly
shape comprehension across lifespan. There are three levels
of comprehension (Kintsch, 1998), including surface-level
(recognizing words), textbase level (semantic integration,
binding concepts) and situation model level of
representations (having a mental model of the situation
described by the text). Decline in processing capacity may
impair surface-level and textbase level processing for
example by reducing ability to integrate concepts to create
textbase (e.g., Stine-Morrow, Miller, Gagne & Hertzog,
2008). However, knowledge can promote conceptual
integration and the use of situation model in reading (e.g.,

Understanding and acting on online health information is
increasingly a pre-requisite for patient self-care. Therefore,
inadequate health literacy is a barrier to self-care among older
adults with chronic illness. The goal of our study was to
improve older adults’ comprehension of online health
information. We extracted typical health texts from multiple
credible health websites, and systematically improved the
texts in terms of, content, language, organization and design.
Results showed that older adults better understood the revised
passages than the typical ones, in terms of their reading
efficiency (time per unit of information uptake). Intervention
benefits were greater for older adults with more domainspecific health knowledge, suggesting that knowledge
facilitated the comprehension of health information in the
revised texts. Implications for promoting older adults’
comprehension of health information are discussed.

Introduction
Health literacy is often defined as the ability to access,
obtain and understand health information in order to support
self-care decisions (U.S. Department of Health Services,
2000). In addition to the fact that older adults were likely to
have inadequate health literacy compared to younger ones
(Baker, Gazmararian, Sudano & Patternson, 2000), there is
mounting evidence showing that health literacy (such as
measured by STOFHLA, Short Test of Functional Health
Literacy in Adults; Baker, Williams, Parker, Gazmararian &
Nurss, 1999) is associated with health behaviors, such as
medication adherence, utilization of health services and
health outcomes (DeWalt, Berkman, Sheridan, Lohr &
Pignone, 2004; Wolf, Gazmararian & Baker, 2005). The
link between inadequate health literacy and poor health
behaviors and outcomes may be due to the fact that older
adults with lower levels of health literacy have more

Chin et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2004). According to this
view, comprehension of health information can be improved
by designing health texts to reduce demands of
comprehension on processing capacity and build on
patients’ knowledge relevant to the texts.
In this study we used a systematic, multi-leveled approach
to revising patient education passages about hypertension
self-care in order to improve older adults’ comprehension of
this information. We examined the following two questions.
First, do participants perform better in the revised texts than
the typical ones? Second, while the intervention was broadly
tapping into multiple patients’ resources, such as processing
capacity and knowledge, we would like to explore whether
some participants benefit more than others from the revised
passages?

found on credible websites. To develop these passages, we
identified websites that provided high quality information
for patients, including National Institute of Aging,
American Heart Association, National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute and Mayo Clinic (HON, Health On the Net,
certified).
Source passages were extracted from the websites, on the
following five hypertension-related topics: an introduction
to high blood pressure, the causes of high blood pressure,
the complications of high blood pressure, lifestyle changes
to improve blood pressure, and the pharmaceutical treatment
of high blood pressure. We then created a typical passage
for each topic was created from the source passages. The
typical passage did not differ from the corresponding source
passages in terms of the number of words, number of
paragraphs, Flesch-Kincaid readability grade level and
Flesch-Kincaid reading ease. A pilot study involving older
adults with similar background to those in the primary study
found that these passages did not statistically differ from
their corresponding sources in terms of rated difficulty.
Four revised passages were then created from these
typical passages. To do this, each typical passage was
revised in terms of its content, organization, language and
design, following guidelines from the literature on patient
education (e.g., Doak, Doak & Root, 1996) and discourse
processing (Hill-Briggs, Schumann & Dike, 2012, Lorch,
Lemari & Gant, 2011), as well as the Process-Knowledge
model of health literacy (Chin et al. 2011). In addition,
revision of the content and organization of the passages was
guided by recommendations of three medical experts (two
internal medicine physicians and one pharmacist) on content
relevancy and completeness, as well as appropriateness of
headers and the order of information. For the organization,
paragraph breaks, titles and headers, and bullet lists were
determined by the use of a consensus process from five
trained students. For language, we made edits on word
choice and sentence structures with multiple reviews from
both trained students and medical experts. For passage
design, we first modified the font size and styles of the
passages, and then included an, a concept outline that served
to signal the important concepts in the passage and the
relations among these concepts (advanced organizer).

Method
Participants
One hundred and twenty eight older participants were
recruited in the study (Age: Mean=70.84 years old,
SD=7.73). Seventy-nine participants were females (61.7%).
Ninety-five participants were patients with hypertension
(74.2%). Most participants had completed high school
(N=109, 85.2%), and the rest completed some high school
(N=11, 8.6%) or did not enter high school (N=8, 6.3%).
Health literacy was measured by a commonly used
standardized test, STOFHLA (Short Test of Functional
Health Literacy in Adults; Baker, Williams, Parker,
Gazmararian, & Nurss, 1999). Although most participants
had adequate health literacy, 12% had marginal health
literacy (N=12), and 5.5% had inadequate health literacy
(N=7).

Measures
We measured processing speed with Letter and Pattern
Comparison (Salthouse, 1991), working memory with
Reading Span (Stine & Hindman, 1994), and general
knowledge with Advanced Vocabulary Task (Ekstrom et al.,
1976). We measured hypertension knowledge with a
questionnaire used in the previous studies (e.g., Chin et al.,
2011; 2015), which consisted of 33 true/false and 4
multiple-choice questions and was modified from
Gazmararian et al. (2003) (Cronbach α=.90; Chin et al.,
2009).
We also measured the psychomotor speed of using the
mouse given that participants would read the passages on a
computer. Participants were told to scroll down five
webpages at their own pace. We used the average time (in
seconds) participants took to scroll down the webpages to
estimate their basic scrolling time without reading activities.

Figure 1. Example passages: (a) typical passage, (b) revised passage

In the study, participants read 5 out of the 9 passages (one
for each topic): a practice passage, two typical passages, and
two revised passages. The practice passage was about the
introduction of hypertension, which was formatted as a
revised passage with the concept outline. The typical and
revised passages were blocked and block order
counterbalanced across all participants. Below showed the
text characteristics of the typical and improved passages
respectively. There were no differences in font size, number
of syllables, number of sentences and grade level between
typical and revised passages. Revised texts were a little
longer than the typical ones in terms of the number of
words.
After reading each passage, participants answered 13
multiple-choice questions to test their understanding about
the passage. For example, “ACE inhibitors and ARBs both
block a hormone that (a) widen your blood vessels, (b)
constrict your blood vessels, (c) decrease the amount of
fluid in your blood, (d) allow calcium to enter the cells of
your arteries”, where (b) was the correct answer. Although
the presentation of information varied in the typical and
revised passages, the main messages and key concepts

remained the same across two types of passages. Only
information that was in both versions of the passages was
tested.

Experimental Design
The within-subject variable is Passage type, typical and
revised. Participants read two passages under each
condition. The order of passages was counterbalanced.

Procedure
Upon arrival to the study, after the consent process,
participants first completed the demographic questionnaire
and the hypertension knowledge questionnaire. Then they
completed a battery of cognitive measures, including Pattern
and Letter Comparison, Reading Span and Advanced
Vocabulary test, and the health literacy measure
(STOFHLA).
Participants were then given the reading task on a
computer. Text was displayed in black Arial 12-point font
on a white background (See task layout in Figure 1). They
read five passages in total: the practice introduction passage,
two typical passages and two revised passages. Participants

377

would see one passage at a time on a computer screen, and
they could scroll up and down the screen at their own pace.
The maximum time allotted for each typical and revised
passage was 9 minutes. All participants finished reading the
passage before the time limit. Participants were instructed to
read the passages for understanding. After reading each
passage, participants first verbally summarized the
information they learned from this passage, and then
answered 13 multiple-choice questions testing their
understanding the key points in the passage. (The data for
summary task will be presented in a later paper)

knowledge and health knowledge were the standardized
scores of advanced vocabulary task and hypertension
knowledge questionnaire, respectively.
Reading time was measured for each passage. , Reading
time data from six participants were missing due to
technical problems. To control for differences in passage
length, we first divided overall passage reading time by the
number of words in the corresponding passage. We used
reading time per word in order to create the reading
efficiency measure. Reading efficiency was operationalized
as the unit reading time divided by the proportion of
information uptake (Miller, 2009), which was defined by
accuracy of responses to the passage comprehension
questions. Therefore, reading efficiency scores were
computed as the reading time per word divided by the
accuracy scores for each passage; that is, the amount of time
readers needed to take to uptake one unit of information.
This reading efficiency measure was the dependent variable
for the mixed effects analysis.

Results
Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the
effects of passage type (typical and revised) as well as
individual difference variables, including age, processing
capacity (PC), general knowledge (GK) and health
knowledge (HK), on reading efficiency. We used the
function lmer in package lme4 (Bates, 2005; Bates &
Sarkar, 2007) to run the models and Baayens MCMC
function to estimate significance intervals for the parameter
estimates (Baayen, et al., 2008) in R software.
The processing capacity variable was constructed by
averaging the standardized scores of the letter comparison,
pattern comparison and reading span tasks.

Correlates of Reading Efficiency
Following the process-knowledge model of health literacy,
we examined the fixed effects of health knowledge in
addition to general knowledge and processing capacity on
reading efficiency. In addition, we entered age and the basic

scrolling time as covariates in the model. Given the random
effects of subjects and passages, we found significant fixed
effects of general knowledge, processing capacity and
scrolling time on reading efficiency. Participants with better
processing capacity, general knowledge, and quicker
scrolling speed, required less time to uptake one unit of
information (processing capacity: B=-26.80, SE=13.22, t=2.03; general knowledge: B=-39.65, SE=10.60, t=-3.74;
scrolling speed: B=2.48, SE=1.02, t=2.44, all p’s <.05).
Thus, general knowledge and processing capacity facilitated
the uptake of health information among older adults.
In addition, given that health knowledge was moderately
associated with general knowledge (r=0.31, p<.01), we
examined the effect of health knowledge on reading
efficiency when only age and health knowledge were used
in the analysis. Participants with more health knowledge
needed less time to uptake one unit of health information
than ones with less health knowledge (B=-25.75, SE=10.31,
t=-2.50, p<.05). Age was not associated with reading
efficiency (B=-1.48, SE=1.33, t=-1.11).

significant after the effects of age, processing capacity and
general knowledge were controlled; (B=-16.86, SE=7.06,
t=-2.39, p<.05; see Model 4 in Table 2). Processing capacity
and general knowledge facilitated the uptake of health
information. In addition, health knowledge further
exaggerated the beneficial effects of revised texts relative to
the typical ones. We plotted the time needed to uptake one
unit of information from the typical and revised texts for
participants who had one standard deviation below and
above the mean health knowledge performance in Figure 2.

Effects of Passage Revision on Comprehension
First, a paired-t test showed that participants had better
comprehension (accuracy scores) of the revised
(Mean=0.74, SD=0.14) compared to the typical passages
(Mean=0.70, SD=0.11) (t(127)=-3.08, p<.01). Participants
also read the revised passages more efficiently (Mean=0.50,
SD=0.23) than the typical passages (Mean=0.60, SD=0.25)
(t(121)=-3.08, p<.01). In other words, they took about 0.1
second less to uptake a unit of information in the revised
passage than the typical ones.

passages on reading efficiency (time per unit of
information uptake)

Discussion
Our findings suggest that older adults’ comprehension of
hypertension self-care information that is readily available
on the internet can be improved by using a systematic multileveled approach to revising the information. Better
comprehension of self-care information should translate into
better health-related decisions, behaviors and outcomes,
because previous research has found that comprehension of
self-care information predicts health behaviors (Dewalt et
al., 2004). Of course this link needs to be demonstrated for
the present passages in future research.
The Process-Knowledge model suggests that processing
capacity and knowledge interact to influence comprehension
of self-care information because these abilities have
different age-related trajectories. Interestingly, we found
that older adults with higher domain-specific health
knowledge benefit more than those with less knowledge
from the revised passages in terms of obtaining information
more quickly. However, there was limitation in the current
study in terms of differentiating the benefits of multiple
levels of text revision on comprehension. Therefore, we
need to be cautious to make arguments about what made
older adults with more health knowledge benefit more from
those with less health knowledge. Theoretically, the
intervention was to reduce the demands on processing
capacity by simplifying the language and streamlining the
organization as well as to promote integrating concepts with
prior knowledge using structural features (such as headers)
and the advanced concept organizer. Hence, the differential

Who Benefits More from the Revised Passages
To identify whether some kinds of participants benefited
from than others from redesigning the passages, we
examined the effects of processing capacity, general
knowledge, health knowledge and their interactions with the
type of passage on reading efficiency using the mixed
effects models (See Table 2).
We first examined the fixed effects of passage type,
processing capacity, and their interaction on reading
efficiency (Model 1 in Table 2). There was no interaction of
processing capacity and passage type, showing that
participants better understood the revised texts than the
typical ones regardless of their level of processing capacity
(B=-17.79, SE=9.79, t=-1.82). A similar analysis of general
knowledge, passage type, and their interaction on reading
efficiency (Model 2 in Table 2) showed that passage type
did not interact with general knowledge, suggesting that
participants better understood the revised texts than the
typical ones regardless of their general knowledge.
However, a similar analysis with health knowledge
(Model 3 in Table 2) revealed a significant interaction of
health knowledge and passage type (B=-19.96, SE=7.30, t=2.74, p<.05). Participants with more health knowledge
benefited more from the revised texts than participants with
less health knowledge. Moreover, the interaction remained

benefits of revised texts on people with more health
knowledge may suggest that having structural features and
advanced concept organizers facilitated reading by building
a situation model representation with prior knowledge.
Although we did find differential accumulative
advantages of older adults with more domain-specific
knowledge gaining more from our intervention, it did not
mean that people with fewer resources (such as lower
processing capacity, lower general or lower health
knowledge) were not able to benefit from the revised health
texts. Though parts of the “Matthew effects”, that people
with better resources gaining more, were observed in our
study, it is not discouraging given that people with poorer
resources, at whom we aimed, were able to take advantages
of the intervention and showed improvement in their
comprehension. Thus, future research will investigate the
effects of different levels of intervention on promoting
comprehension for people varying in cognitive resources.
