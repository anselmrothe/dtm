subsequent rounds. Therefore, belief revision as a result of
increased information could be observed in rounds 2 to 8.
During the seven rounds of change, participants had an op-
portunity to enter revised answers, observe others revise their
answers and so on.
   We used two measures to determine the magnitude of
change by each participant: absolute change and percent
change. Absolute change refers to by how much each partic-
ipant changed his or her answer, while percent change refers
to the percentage of the change in the subsequent round com-
pared to the previous answer.
   Most changes tended to occur in the first round, dropping
off sharply and stabilising in the later rounds. As Figure 2
demonstrates, some 35 percent of all change occurred in the
first round. This drops off to just under 20 percent in the
second round and remains at 10 percent for the later rounds.
   This held true for three of the four groups. With respect
to the magnitude of change, there were two notable outliers.           Figure 3: Percent Change of Answers by Round (Group 1)

(median, egocentric trim, consensus trim). The consensus            seems imperative given that the most common models of be-
trim model performs worst, with the median second, and              lief and opinion dynamics assume constant weights.
Yaniv and Milyavsky’s (2007) egocentric trim model is the
best in both their and our study (n.b. the relationship between
median and egocentric trim in their study varies as a function
of number of pieces of advice, so we considered the average
performance across their conditions, which is also appropri-
ate because participants in our small world network vary in
the number of others they are connected to.) Finally, our two
averaging models place fourth and fifth.
   How then do these models fare in predicting repeated
rounds of revision in a dynamically changing environment,
where –due to the partial connectivity of the network– in-
formation only gradually propagates through the network?              Figure 6: Actual Percentage Change by Round (Group 1)
Again, the ’no change’ model is the best predictor, followed
somewhat more closely by the egocentric trim model. Me-
dian and split the different are now virtually tied for third.
The consensus trim, again, comes last suggesting that it fails
to capture participants’ approach to opinion variability in a
meaningful way.
   Where do the failures of the models lie? First, all models
(with the obvious exception of the no change model) over-
predict change for the first round of revision, that is, the
transition from participants initial answer to their second an-
swer. In other words, despite the fact that most change in
participants’ responses occurs in the first round of revision,
participants still change less than the models suggest they
should. This can be seen by comparing Figure 6 which dis-           Figure 7: Predicted Percentage Change by Round for Ego-
