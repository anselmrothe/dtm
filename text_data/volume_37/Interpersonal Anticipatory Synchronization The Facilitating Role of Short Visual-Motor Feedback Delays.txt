               Data Analysis & Results
Cross-Correlation and Phase Lead
To determine whether anticipatory synchronization occurred
between coordinators and producers, we first performed a
cross-correlation analysis between the movements of the
coordinator and producer. This analysis indexes the degree
of synchrony between two behavioral time series across a
range of possible temporal relationships (see Stepp, 2009).
Of relevance for determining anticipatory synchronization is
the maximum degree of synchrony that occurred (indexed
by the maximum observed cross-correlation coefficient) and
the corresponding time lag (or lead) at which the synchrony        Figure 1: Cross-correlation and temporal lead. (Top)

   Consistent with the results of the maximum cross-
correlation analysis, the relative phase distributions
indicated that the coordinator did indeed anticipate the
aperiodic movements of the producer for the 400 ms
feedback delay condition. Additionally, although a modest
degree of anticipatory behavior was observed for the 600 ms
condition, the stability of the phase relationship between the
coordinator and the producer at this feedback delay was
again found to be very low. More interestingly, however,
the distributions of relative phase didn’t just reveal
anticipatory behavior on the part of the coordinator for the
200 ms condition. They also showed that for this condition,
as well as for the 400 and 600 ms feedback delay
conditions, coordinators both lagged and led producer
movements, suggesting that the anticipatory synchronization
observed was intermittent. Intermittent, or relative,
coordination is a known characteristic of weakly coupled
physical or biological limit-cycle oscillators (see Kelso &
Ding, 1993), including visually coupled rhythmic limb
movements of co-acting individuals (Schmidt &
Richardson, 2008). While this has never before been
demonstrated with respect to anticipatory synchronization in
the context of feedback delays, evidence of similar
