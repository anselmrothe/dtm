In the classic version of the task, children are shown a box
that appears to contain one thing but contains something
different. After the child is shown the box’s true contents,
they are introduced to a character who has never seen inside
the box, and asked what the character thinks is inside the
box. Young children often incorrectly answer that the
character will already know what the box contains. In our
version, thought bubbles displayed what the character
thought was inside the box. This allowed us to ask children
to compare mental states as well as states of the world.
