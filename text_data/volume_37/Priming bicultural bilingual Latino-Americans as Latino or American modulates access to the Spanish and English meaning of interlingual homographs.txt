Abstract
Using Spanish-English bilingual Latino-Americans, this study
tested whether priming Latino or American cultural
representations facilitated the accessibility of the Spanish
meaning or English meaning of Spanish-English homographs.
Seventy-four participants were randomly assigned to a Latino
prime, American prime, or no prime condition. After being
primed, subjects performed an English lexical decision task
wherein they indicated whether a letter string formed an
English word. Homographs, English controls, and non-words
were included in the array. As predicted, there was a
significant prime condition by word type interaction, F(2,
70)= 5.48, p= .006, partial eta squared = .136, suggesting that
prime condition modulated reaction times to homographs.
Planned contrasts showed that participants in the Latino prime
condition had slower reaction times to homographs than
English controls, F(1, 22)= 4.84, p= .039, partial eta squared
= .180, suggesting that the Latino prime facilitated access to
homographs’ Spanish meaning.

Introduction
Bicultural bilinguals are individuals who have been raised
within two distinct sociocultural contexts wherein they
acquire the common language and learn the defining
features of each sociocultural context. The consequence of
learning one language within one cultural context, and
another language within a different cultural context is that
the languages become preferentially linked to cultural
representations that mentally represent the values, beliefs,
expectations and other knowledge of the cultural context in
which the language was acquired (Ross, Xun, & Wilson,
2002; Zhang, Morris, Cheng & Yap, 2013). This
relationship is in part modeled by the modified hierarchical
model (Pavlenko, 2009) where some concepts are depicted
as being more accessible by one language than the other.

This asymmetrical relationship between concepts and L1 or
L2 is in part dependent on which sociocultural context both
languages were acquired. If bicultural bilinguals acquire L1
in one sociocultural context (C1) and L2 in a different
context (C2), L1 and L2 may develop different intralingual
patterns of conceptual associations and stronger links to
cultural representations of the sociocultural context in which
it was mostly acquired. More specifically, as discussed
above, L1 would have stronger links to C1 than C2
representations, and L2 would have stronger links to C2
than C1 representations.
This relationship develops through habitual use of L1 to
reference concepts associated with C1, and habitual use of
L2 to reference the concepts associated with C2. For
example, Jared, Pei Yun Poh, & Paivio (2013) recruited
Mandarin-English bilinguals who were born in China and
had lived there, on average for 15 years. These bilinguals
were undergraduates in Canada and had lived there for an
average of 5 years. Participants named aloud culturallybiased images of objects (e.g., image of a typical mailbox in
China and a typical mailbox in Canada) in both Mandarin
and English. Chinese culturally-biased images were named
faster when using Mandarin than English, and Canadian
culturally-biased images were named faster when using
English than Mandarin. These findings suggest that some
images along with their conceptual representation can be
more strongly linked to one language than another. These
Mandarin-English bilinguals likely learned to label the
Chinese culturally-biased images using Mandarin and the
Canadian culturally-biased images using English, resulting
in stronger connections between Mandarin words and
Chinese images and English words and Canadian images.
Furthermore, these findings and other reviewed studies
suggest an asymmetrical relationship between L1 and L2
lexical structures and C1 and C2 networks in that using one

1535

language would prime the associated network of cultural
representations, and activating a one network of cultural
representations would prime lexical structures in the
associated lexicon.
Research has shown that the language in which a task is
performed influences which cultural representations become
active. For example, Kemmelmeier and Cheng (2004)
administered in English or Chinese an independent and
interdependent self-construal scale to bilinguals in Hong
Kong. They found that conceptual accessibility varied as a
function of task language. Specifically, participants’ who
took the survey in English scored higher on the independent
self-construal scale than those who took the survey in
Chinese. This result suggests that performing the task in
English facilitated access to concepts reflecting an
independent self-construal that is common of Westerners
than an interdependent self-construal that is common of East
Asians. If processing L2 (L1) activates the concepts
associated with C2 (C1), it is likely that the C2 network of
cultural representations is also primed. As result, items
encountered while using L2 (L1) are potentially being
processed according to C2 (C1) representations (Chen &
Bond, 2010; Kemmelmeier & Cheng, 2004; Ross, Xun, &
Wilson, 2002).
Given that language use can facilitate the accessibility
culture representations, one would assume that activating
cultural representations could facilitate or inhibit lexical
access (Jared, et al., 2013; Zhang, Morris, Cheng, & Yap,
2013). Zhang, Morris, Cheng, and Yap (2013) tested
whether priming C1 representations directly interfered with
L2 production by activating L1 structures. Their participants
were coordinated Chinese-English bilinguals who had lived
in the US 3 - 14 months. In Study 1, participants performed
a computer-mediated conversation in where they listened to
a pre-recorded speech about campus life while attending to a
photograph of an American student (either Chinese or
Caucasian face). After hearing the speech, participants
verbally responded to the topic in English while being
recorded. Compared to baseline measures, the participants
showed decreased English fluency (number of words per
minute) when speaking to a Chinese face compared to a
Caucasian face. In Study 2, Zhang et al. (2013) found that
English fluency significantly decreased when participants
describe Chinese cultural icons (e.g., Great Wall) in
English, but not when they described American cultural
icons (e.g., Mount Rushmore) in English. These results
suggest that viewing an individual or icon that represents
C1, primes C1 representations and subsequently interferes
with L2 production.
To assess whether C1 interference of L2 production was
specifically through the activation of L1 lexical structures,
Zhang et al. (Study 3) presented participants with pictures of
objects with anomalous literal translations (e.g., In Chinese
the literal translation of “Pistachios” is “Happy Nuts”).
Participants were tested with name-recognition trials where

they judged whether the target English word/phrase
identified the pictured object. Some words/phrases were
English names like “pistachio” and others were Chinese
literal translations like “happy nuts.” In this study, the same
prime technique from Study 2 was administered prior to the
presentation of name recognition trials to assess whether a
Chinese prime or American prime facilitated access to the
Chinese literal translations or the American English name
respectively. They found that Chinese icons facilitated the
accessibility of Chinese literal translations, but American
icons had no facilitating effects.
These results suggest that the presentation of nonlinguistic
cultural cues (i.e., faces or cultural icons) activates C1
representations, primes L1 structures and subsequently
interferes with L2 production. More specifically, activating
C1 representations primes Chinese lexical structures that
share more features with literal English translations (e.g.,
happy nuts) than the actual English referents (e.g.,
pistachio), making the literal translations more accessible
than the English referents. The lack of facilitation by the
American prime simply reveals the limited storing of
American cultural representations that would activate
English lexical forms.
Li, Yang, Scherf, and Li (2013) found similar results to
Zhang et al. (2014), and that the activation of lexical
structures by nonlinguistic cultural cues was reflected in
neural activation patterns. Chinese-English bilinguals
performed a picture-naming task in Chinese and English. In
addition, objects to be named were presented with a
Caucasian face, Chinese face, or no face. Participants
performed the task twice: once inside a functional MRI to
track activation of key brain regions during the different
conditions (participants believed their naming reaction times
were being recorded), and again outside of the fMRI to
record naming reaction times. Li et al. (2013) found that
picture naming was significantly faster in Chinese (subjects’
L1) than English only when objects were paired with a
Chinese face. Furthermore, fMRI data showed that the
frontal and parietal brain regions received significantly
larger clusters of activation when face and language pairings
were congruent (e.g., Chinese face while naming in Chinese
or Caucasian face while naming in English) than
incongruent.
In light of the reviewed research, L1 and L2 facilitate access
to different concepts and prime respectively C1 and C2
representations influencing how information is processed.
Moreover, activating C1 and C2 representations primes
respectively L1 and L2 structures influencing language
production. Studies reviewed in this section, however, have
only investigated the effects of nonlinguistic cultural cues
on language production, and has not provided any evidence
that nonlinguistic cultural cues would have similar effects in
a language reception task (i.e. lexical decision task), an
issue that is investigated in this study.

Current Study
The purpose of this study is to test whether priming cultural
representations affects excitatory and inhibitory processes
within a language reception task. It is common to use
interlingual homographs to assess the excitatory and
inhibitory processes of the bilingual language system. Both
meanings of a homograph are activated in parallel, but the
meaning irrelevant to the task is inhibited (Macizo, Bajo, &
Martin, 2010). It is theorized here that the presentation of
cultural icons influences the activation of L1 and L2
structures by sending excitation to language tags, as
depicted in the Inhibitory Control model (Green, 1998), that
control activation and inhibition of the target and non-target
language respectively.
Using Latino-Americans who are English-Spanish
bilinguals as participants, this study tests whether priming
Latino (C2) and American (C1) cultural representations
facilitate access to the Spanish (L2) homograph meaning
and English (L1) homograph meaning respectively.
Participants were shown either icons representative of
Latino or American culture, or photographs of neutral
scenes and asked to describe briefly each photograph.
Afterwards, participants were presented with an English
lexical decision task in which they decided whether a letter
string formed a real English word. The array of letter strings
included English control words, Spanish-English
homographs, and non-words. Including only English words
in the task facilitates the accessibility of the English
homograph meaning limiting interference of the Spanish
homograph meaning in lexical decisions to homographs
(Dijkstra et al., 1998). Therefore, it is predicted that
participants who describe neutral photographs will show no
difference in lexical decision reaction time between
homographs and English control words. Given the English
context of the task and the assumption that American
cultural icons will facilitate the accessibility of English,
participants who describe American cultural icons are
predicted to show no difference in lexical decision reaction
time between homographs and English control words, and
have faster lexical decisions to words than those who
describe neutral photographs. In contrast, Latino cultural
icons are predicted to facilitate the accessibility of Spanish.
Therefore, participants who describe Latino cultural icons
are predicted to have slower reactions times to homographs
than English control words. Findings from this study may
provide insight into how lexical structures and cultural
representations are organized in semantic memory as well as
practical implications for how bicultural bilinguals
comprehend and encode written information.

Methods
Design and Participants
This study is a 3 (Prime condition: Latino prime, American
prime, or No prime) x 2 (Word type: Homograph and
English control word) mixed factorial design with prime
condition as the between-subjects variable. Ninety-one

Spanish-English bilingual Latino-Americans were recruited
from the Los Angeles Metropolitan area. There were three
inclusion criteria: participants must be 18 years of age or
older, a Spanish-English bilingual, and have at least one
parent who is of Latino/Hispanic heritage. Eighteen
participants were excluded for being a multivariate on
Spanish or English proficiency scale or a univariate outlier
in terms of the total number of excluded trials (e.g., errors,
outliers, unrecognized homographs and their matched
English control words) and reaction times to homographs,
English controls, and non-words. Analyses were conducted
using data from 73 (18 Male, 55 Female) participants.
Participants’ mean age was 20.03 years (SD = 2.75). The
majority of participants were born in the US (n = 63, 86%),
grew up in a home where both Spanish and English was
spoken (n = 40, 55%), and indicated that they used English
more often (n = 38, 52%) than Spanish (Table 1).

Materials
Priming icons A set of icons that represented American and
Latino culture were selected to be used as cultural icons.
The American icons included the following: Abraham
Lincoln, Statue of Liberty, a depiction of the declaration of
independence with words “We the People” visible sitting
next to an American flag, burger and fries, and a football
game. The Latino icons included the following: the Mexican
flag, “Our Lady of Guadalupe”, a soccer match, a plate of
tamales, and a couple dancing a traditional Mexican dance.
Some of the icons resemble those used in Lechuga (2008).
Homographs and English control words Forty
interlingual homographs and 40 non-homograph English
control words were taken from Macizo, Bajo, and Martin
(2010). Eighty non-words were also included. Word
frequency (number of times, on average, a word occurs in

1537

written text) was matched for the English meaning of
homographs (M = 460.45; SD = 1357.72), English
translation of the Spanish meaning of homographs (M =
410; SD = 1658), and the English control words (M =
444.83; SD = 1487.19).
Language history and culture questionnaire A language
history and culture questionnaire was used to assess
participants’ experience with and self-reported proficiency
in Spanish and English, as well as participants’ cultural
identity. On this questionnaire, participants indicated basic
demographic information (Age, Gender, Education level,
childhood socioeconomic status, immigration status, and
race/ethnicity). On the language history portion, participants
indicated their first and second language, and the language
most frequently spoken in their home during childhood.
Participants indicated whether they use English or Spanish
the most on a 7-point scale (1 = I use English the most; 7 = I
use Spanish the most). Participants indicated how they
learned English and Spanish on a 7-point scale (1 = Mostly
through formal education; 7 = Mostly through interacting
with people). Also, on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Low; 7 =
High) participants rated their Spanish and English
proficiency in each of five areas: reading, spelling, writing,
speaking, and speech comprehension. In addition,
participants indicated how often they had read, heard, or
used the Spanish meaning of each homograph on a 7-point
Likert scale (0= Not at all; 6 = Very Often). For each
participant, the number of homographs responded to with a
0, indicating they did not recognize ever being exposed to
the Spanish homograph meaning, were counted and
recorded as a continuous variable (number of unrecognized
homographs). After excluding unrecognized homographs, a
homograph frequency of exposure rating was calculated on
a 6-point scale (1 = Rarely; 6 = Very often) for each
participant.
To assess the degree to which participants identified with
Latino culture, the revised version of Phinney’s (1992)
multiethnic identity scale was included in the questionnaire.
This version consists of 12 items rated on a 4 point Likert
scale (1 = Strongly disagree; 4 = Strongly agree) from
which an average score is calculated (Phinney, Romero,
Nava, & Huang, 2001). In our study, the scale was adapted
to a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree; 7 = Strongly
agree) for symmetry with other scales on the questionnaire.

Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to either the American
prime, Latino prime, or no prime condition. They were told
that the experiment involved a (a) photograph description
task in which they would make descriptive responses to five
photographs, (b) an English lexical decision task in which
they indicated whether a presented letter string was an
English word, and (c) a recognition task for the previously
seen photographs. The experimental task was administered
via a Macintosh desktop computer, and programmed using
Super Lab software. The sequence of tasks started with

practice trials. Participants were seated approximately 23
inches from a computer monitor. For practice, participants
were presented one neutral photograph to describe. After
describing the practice photograph, participants performed
10 practice trials of the English lexical decision task. Each
letter string remained on the screen until the participant
provided a “Yes” or “No” response by pressing the “z” or
“m” key respectively. Letter strings were separated by a
500ms screen with two fixation crosses in the center. After
the practice trials, participants were verbally informed that
for the test trials speed and accuracy were important and
that they were to make their responses as quickly and
accurately as possible. Participants in the American and
Latino prime condition were presented five icons culturally
relevant to their respective condition. In the No prime
condition, participants saw five neutral photographs. After
the priming task, participants were introduced to the test
trials of the English lexical decision task. Participants
performed 160 test trials of the English lexical decision task
in random order for each participant. They were not
informed that interlingual homographs were included. The
reaction time for each lexical decision was recorded. Test
trials were followed by a photograph recognition task that
included the five previously seen photographs and 15
distracters.

Results
A series of Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the
percentage of excluded words and nonwords was conducted
with prime condition as a factor. Prime conditions did not
differ in the percentage of excluded words, F(2, 70) = .610,
p = . 546, partial eta squared = .017, and nonwords, F(2, 70)
= .820, p = . 445, partial eta squared = .023. On average,
16.40% (SD = 9.7%) of words and 15.18% (SD = 11%) of
non-words had to excluded due to errors, outliers, or
unrecognized homographs.
A repeated measure ANOVA on participants’ proficiency
ratings was conducted with language (Spanish and English),
proficiency type (reading, writing, speaking, spelling, and
speech comprehension), and prime condition (No prime,
Latino prime, or American prime) as factors. Means and
standard deviations are presented in Table 2. Participants
reported higher proficiency in English than Spanish, evident
by the significant Langauge effect, F(1, 70) = 109.30, p <
.001, partial eta squared = .610 and significant Language by
proficiency interaction, F(4, 178) = 19.92, p > . 001, partial
eta squared = .222. The interaction among proficiency,
language, and prime condition was not significant, F(8, 136)
= 1.12, p = . 353, partial eta squared = .062, suggesting that
Spanish reading, writing, spelling, speaking, and speech
comprehension did not differ respectively from English
reading, writing, spelling, speaking, and speech
comprehension among the prime conditions.

Discussion
The significant interaction of word type and prime condition
on lexical decision time confirms that priming cultural
representations affects accessibility of the target and nontarget meaning of interlingual homographs. Participants in
the Latino prime condition responded slower to homographs
than English controls. This result is attributed to images
reflecting aspects of Latino culture activating Latino cultural
representations and the associated language, Spanish.
Consequently, this process increased the accessibility of
homograph’s Spanish meaning and slowed lexical decisions
for homographs. It is important to note that the null result in
the no prime condition is a replication of the findings of
Dijkstra (1998, experiment 1), suggesting that performing
the task in an English context facilitated the accessibility of
English limiting interference from the homographs’ Spanish
meaning. The American prime had a similar effect, in that
its results are comparable to the no prime condition,
suggesting the facilitation of access to the homograph’s
English meaning limiting interference from the Spanish
meaning. In sum, the findings suggest that priming cultural
representations modulates excitatory processes in the
bilingual language system and that nonlinguistic cultural
cues may aid in resolving competition for activation
between L1 and L2 during a language reception task.

Variability in Bilingualism

As predicted, there was a significant prime condition by
word type interaction, F(2, 70)= 5.48, p= .006, partial eta
squared = .136 (Figure 1). Planned contrasts were conducted
on reaction times to homographs and English control words
for each prime condition. Participants in the Latino prime
condition had slower reaction times to homographs (M=
654.42; SD= 85.44) than English controls (M= 630.25; SD=
69.36), F(1, 22)= 4.84, p= .039, partial eta squared = .180.
There were no significant differences between reaction
times to homographs and English controls for No prime
condition, F(1, 24)= .114, p= .739, partial eta squared =
.005, or American prime condition, F(1, 24)= 4.13, p= .053,
partial eta squared = .147.

In studies trying to modulate parallel processes in the
bilingual language system, it is important to note that
several factors have been found to influence interlingual
activation such as: language proficiency and dominance
(Basnight-Brown & Altarriba, 2007; Costa & Santesteban,
2004; Elston-Guttler, Paulmann, & Kotz, 2005), language
history and the current language context in which the
participants are immersed (Kroll, Bobb, & Wodniecka,
2006). As reviewed by Kroll and Bialystok (2013),
bilingualism is not a simple categorical variable but instead
a dynamic multidimensional interaction of linguistic,
cognitive, social, experiential, educational, and other
factors. This study along with others (Zhang et al., 2013 and
Li et al., 2013) has found evidence for nonlinguistic cultural
cues being another contextual factor that may influence
excitation and inhibitory processes in the bilingual language
system.

Language and culture are intertwined in that culture
sanctions a particular way of understanding and associating
entities in the environment and this occurrence influences
the structure of language. Monocultural bilinguals,
bicultural monolinguals, and bicultural bilinguals each
represent a number of ways that cultural representations
lexical structures can be organized in distinct yet linked
networks. But, bicultural bilinguals provide a rare
opportunity not only to study the intersection between
language systems and networks of cultural representations,
but also to understand the dynamic contextually driven

1539

nature of this relationship that likely varies as a function of
one’s language and cultural history.
