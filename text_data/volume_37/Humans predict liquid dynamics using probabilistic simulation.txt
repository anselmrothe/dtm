   Liquids can splash, squirt, gush, slosh, soak, drip, drain,
   trickle, pool, and be poured–complex behaviors that we can
   easily distinguish, imagine, describe, and, crucially, predict,
   despite tremendous diversity among different liquids’ material
   and dynamical characteristics. This proficiency suggests the
   brain has a sophisticated cognitive mechanism for reasoning
   about liquids, yet to date there has been little effort to study this
   mechanism quantitatively or describe it computationally. Here
   we find evidence that people’s reasoning about how liquids
   move is consistent with a computational cognitive model based
   on approximate probabilistic simulation. In a psychophysical
   experiment, participants predicted how different liquids would
   flow around solid obstacles, and their judgments agreed with
   those of a family of models in which volumes of liquid are
   represented as collections of interacting particles, within a dy-
   namical fluid simulation. Our model explains people’s accu-
   racy, and their predictions’ sensitivity to liquids of different
   viscosity. We also explored several models that did not involve
   simulation, and found they could not account for the experi-
   mental data as well. Our results are consistent with previous
   reports that people’s physical understanding of solid objects is
   based on simulation, but extends this thesis to the more com-
   plex and unexplored domain of reasoning about liquids.
