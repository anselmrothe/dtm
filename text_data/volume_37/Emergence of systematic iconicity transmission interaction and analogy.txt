The listener listened to the speaker’s signal and was
presented with a panel showing all the possible meanings.
The listener chose one of these meanings as their guess for
what the speaker intended. Both players were given
feedback after each guess, showing the target meaning and
what the listener guessed. Each meaning was presented as
the target twice, in a random order, with participants
alternating roles as speaker and listener after each
presentation, so that each participant took the role of
speaker for each meaning once.

Except for each first pair of participants in a transmission
chain, both participants were first trained on a language
before interacting. In this training they were exposed to each
meaning and the last signal used for that meaning by the
previous pair. Participants only saw a random half of the
previous meanings, and there were two training rounds in             Figure 3: Proportion of correct guesses for each meaning
