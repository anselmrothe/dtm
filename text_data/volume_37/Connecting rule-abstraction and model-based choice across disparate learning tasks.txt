outcome individually do result in the outcome when
presented together (e.g. C-/D-/CD+). In addition,
participants were presented with a number of cues that
appeared either individually (e.g. I+/J+) or in compound
(e.g. KL-) but not both.
   Accurate performance on these discriminations can be
achieved through learning the associations between
combinations of cues and outcomes. However the structure
of the task can also be described by an abstract “opposites”
rule. That is, individual cues and their compounds predict
opposite outcomes. In the test phase, participants continued
to predict whether or not food cues would cause an allergic
reaction, in the absence of feedback. This phase included all
the training cues, as well as the remaining cues from the
incomplete discriminations (e.g. IJ). Participants’ responses        Figure 2. Two-step task transition structure. Each first stage

   Two-Step Task Participants completed 200 trials of the
two-step choice task (Figure 2). On each trial, two fractal
images representing the first-stage options appeared on a
black background. Participants were required to make a left
or right response using the “Z” or “?” key, respectively.
Once a choice was made, the background changed to either
blue or green to indicate the second-stage state, and the
selected first-stage image moved to the top of the screen.
Another two fractal images were presented and participants
were again required to make a choice response. Feedback
was then provided while the selected image remained
highlighted on screen. Participants were presented with
either an image of a coin (reward), or the number zero (no
reward).

Two-Step Task
Figure 4A shows the effects of reward and transition type on
first-stage outcome choice for all participants in the two-
step task. We estimated a mixed effects logistic regression
(Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) with first-stage choice (stay vs.
switch) as the dependent variable, using binary predictors
that indicated whether a reward was received on the
previous trial, and transition type on the previous trial
(common vs. rare). Full coefficient estimates are reported in
Table 2. There was a significant main effect of reward,
revealing a tendency to repeat rewarded first-stage choices
(p < .001). The interaction between reward and transition
type suggests a significant model-based contribution to
choice (p < .001).
