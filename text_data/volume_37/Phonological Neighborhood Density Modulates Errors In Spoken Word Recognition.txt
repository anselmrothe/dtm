   The simulations were conducted using the jTRACE
implementation (Strauss, Harris & Magnuson, 2007) of the
TRACE model of speech perception and spoken word
recognition (McClelland & Elman, 1986). For each
simulation, a target word was presented and response
probabilities were computed using the R. D. Luce (1959)
choice rule for four response options: the target word, a
cohort competitor, a rhyme competitor, and a
phonologically unrelated word. Minimal artificial lexicons
were constructed to provide a simple context for testing
effects of cohort and rhyme density. Each lexicon contained
the same three critical quartets of words (target, cohort,
rhyme, and unrelated). The base lexicon consisted of only
those 12 words. Two additional lexicons were created by
adding either four cohort or four rhyme competitors (to
