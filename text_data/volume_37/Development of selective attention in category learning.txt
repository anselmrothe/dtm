tion behavior. We denote the first trial in the sequence where
participants reach the learning criterion as T 0, and aligned
participants with respect to this trial to create optimization
curves. Optimization curves are shown in Figure 3.
   For the Non-GC condition, the interpolated mean plot
shows some increase in the proportion of fixations at the de-
terministic feature for the LS and HS categories for both chil-
dren and adults. Recall that the LS categories contain less
reliable probabilistic features, so more looks toward the deter-
ministic feature would be advantageous. The HS categories,
on the other hand, show a slight decrease from the initial pro-
portion of deterministic fixations by the end of the task.
   For the GC condition, the interpolated mean plots show an
increasing proportion of fixations at the deterministic AOI,
beginning slightly before T 0 and persisting for several trials,
for all category types and age groups. This means that on av-
erage, participants more frequently fixated the deterministic
features than probabilistic features as they gained experience

participants learn the category and replicating a trend found
in another eye tracking categorization study (Rehder & Hoff-
man, 2005). These results, taken together, suggest that at least
some adults and children optimized attention during the task.
Of interest, however, is: (1) whether there are developmental
differences in the proportion who optimize, and (2) the role
of category structure.
   To analyze individual differences in attention optimization
behavior, for each participant we determined the change in
the average proportion of deterministic AOI looks before to
after T 0. Positive values denote an average increase in the
proportion of looking at the deterministic feature after T 0,
indicating attention optimization. We plot those results in

   For adults in Non-GC condition, trends shows increased
attention optimization for the two more difficult categories
(LS and HS+V), and there was a marginally significant ef-
