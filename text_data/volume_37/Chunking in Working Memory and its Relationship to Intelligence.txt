Participants and Procedure
The tests were administered to 183 students (Mage = 21; SD
= 2.8) in the following order: the Chunking span task
(SIMON), the Working Memory Capacity Battery (WMCB)
(Lewandowsky, Oberauer, Yang & Ecker, 2010) and
Raven’s APM (Raven, 1962) (set #2, 40 minutes). The
WMCB includes four tasks: a memory updating task (MU),
two complex span tasks (operation and sentence span, OS
and SS), and a spatial simple span task (spatial short-term           Figure 2: Proportion correct as a function of complexity

correlation, but none of the digit span tasks correlated more
with either Simon simple or Simon Complex than the two
together. One possibility is that the participants could still
chunk many of the most complex sequences, making the
two Simon conditions akin, and accounting for the slight
difference of 1.25 colors reported above. The possibility that
participants chunk the less compressible sequences does not
contradict compressibility theories because the estimate of
the compressibility of a string is an upper bound (meaning
that there can always be a way to compress a string more
than it is expected). Regarding correlations with the Raven,
the highest correlation was found with DSB, but the
