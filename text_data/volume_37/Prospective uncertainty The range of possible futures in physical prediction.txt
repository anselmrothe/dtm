horizontal position of the paddle varied across trials.
   For each trial, we obtained two measurements from each
participant: the center point of the paddle to indicate their
best guess about where the ball would go, and the size of the
paddle to indicate their confidence in that prediction. On
each trial, we also determined where the ball actually
crossed the plane of the paddle according to computerized
Newtonian mechanics, and we will call this location
“ground truth.”
   Participants were given five practice trials with no
occlusion to ensure that they understood the ball would
move with Newtonian mechanics and then eight further
practice trials with occluded movement to ensure they were
comfortable with the task and controls.
Results
Because idealized Newtonian mechanics is deterministic,
the ground truth outcomes from the computer physics
engine have no variability, and thus we cannot compare
participants’ internal measures of uncertainty against
“ground truth variability” in the trial outcomes based on
computer physics. Instead, we measured whether people               Figure 2: Top: Across-subject variation (standard deviation

Although an individual’s uncertainty tracks with the amount
of variability across people, we might wonder how that
representation of uncertainty is formed. For this we turn to a
prior model of physical prediction from Smith and Vul
(2013). We show that the amount of uncertainty expected by
