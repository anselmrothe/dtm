   where interventions act in real-world causal systems. We
   provided people with a description of a novel health condition
   that could be treated by two different treatments, a medication
   and a lifestyle modification. Participants judged a medication
   as acting on the symptoms of a disorder instead of the cause
   of the disorder, while a lifestyle modification was seen as
   acting on both the cause and the symptoms of a health
   condition (Experiment 1). These results held despite                        C              S              C             S
