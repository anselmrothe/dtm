searchers have spent years in examining the analytic/holistic
processing dichotomy. One simple and efficient way to
compare between hemispheres is the use of the divided vis-
ual field methodology, in which a stimulus is presented to
only one visual field so that it is initially received and pro-
cessed by the contralateral hemisphere (see e.g., Bourne,
2006).

A mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a main
effect of visual field, F(2, 92) = 34.428, p < .001, p2 = .428;
and a main effect of congruency, F(1, 46) = 59.168, p
< .001, p2 = .563. In general, participants performed worse
in the center condition than in the LVF or the RVF condi-
tion (both adjusted by Bonferroni, p < .001). Also, their per-
formance was worse in incongruent trials than in congruent
trials (adjusted by Bonferroni, p < .001). In addition, there
was a marginal three-way interaction between expertise,
alignment, and congruency, F(1, 46) = 3.528, p = .067, p2
= .071. There was also a marginal interaction between ex-
pertise, visual field, alignment, and congruency was found,
F(2, 92) = 2.606, p = .079, p2 = .054. This marginal four-
way interaction indicated that the HP effect in the three vis-
ual fields might differ between the groups. When the data
was split by visual field, an interaction between expertise,
alignment, and congruency was significant only in the LVF
condition (F(1, 46) = 10.21, p = .003, p2 = .182), but not in
the center (F(1, 46) = .194, n.s.) or the RVF condition (F(1,
46) = .146, n.s.). In order words, expertise modulates HP
effect in the LVF. Further analyses in the following section
will examine how HP effects emerged in the LVF and RVF
differently between the two groups.
Comparison between LVF vs. RVF
Here we focused on comparing the LVF and RVF condi-
tions so as to tap into hemispheric lateralization effects.
When we directly compared the LVF and RVF condition,
the four-way interaction between expertise, visual field,
alignment, and congruency was significant, F(1, 46) = 6.589,
p = .014, p2 = .125.2 To understand this four-way interac-
tion, further analyses were done separately on expert and
novice group. For the novice group, there was a significant
interaction between visual field, alignment, and congruency,             Figure 4: Discrimination performance for the composite task.
