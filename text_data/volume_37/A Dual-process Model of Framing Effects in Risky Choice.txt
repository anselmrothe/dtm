blocks, each block consisting of 160 trials: eighty gain
frames and eighty loss frames, for a grand total of 320 trials.
All choices and response times were recorded, as well as
participants’ age and gender.
Framing Effect We are interested in the framing effect that
occurs with risky decision-making between the sure and
gamble options. For this experiment, a framing effect occurs
for a participant when a) in the gain frame, the decision-
maker chooses the “sure” option; and b) in the loss frame,
the decision-maker chooses the “gamble” option. Thus, we
categorize risk-averse behavior in gains and risk-seeking
behavior in equivalent losses as a framing effect.

presence or absence of time pressure. One block is a speed
block (SPD) where participants are told that their goal is to
“Respond quickly” and for each trial, are given 1000 ms to
make a choice. Since the task involves earning money, a
latent but unwritten goal of the SPD block is to earn money.
However, to ensure time pressure, the only directions given
to participants in the SPD block were to “Respond
Quickly.” If they fail to make a choice within this amount of
time, they receive a feedback message that states that they

Because the gamble is described the same way in both the
gain and the loss frames (that is, participants see the same
pie chart), we assume that 𝑉𝐺 is the same in both frames.
   However, the sure option is described differently in the
two frames. In the gain frame, participants are told they can
keep 𝑠 and in the loss frame, they are told that they will lose
𝑙 = 𝑟 − 𝑠. To capture these differences in framing, we
assume that the subjective value of the sure thing in the gain
frame is:
                          𝑉𝑆 (𝑠) = 𝑣(𝑠)                     (5)
and in the loss frame is:
   𝑉𝑆 (𝑟 − 𝑙) = 𝑉𝑆 (𝑟) + 𝑉𝑆 (−𝑙) = 𝑣(𝑟) + 𝑣(−𝑙).         (6)

no risk or uncertainty involved in the sure option.                 Figure 6B: Heatmap showing the probability of choosing
