Abstract

paper, we revisit earlier studies (conducted from 2008 to
2011), replicate the results and compare our new data with
both the older data sets and with other recently collected
samples (Steen, Reijnierse, & Burgers, 2014).
We find that while the overall landscape of opinion on the
topic of crime has shifted, metaphorical frames continue to
have an influence on people’s reasoning about crime. In two
experiments and two norming studies we examine some of
the methodological considerations for research on metaphor
as it exists in the dynamic landscape of public discourse. We
address some common misunderstandings and review some
inferential limitations of the available methods. Our results
and analyses highlight the importance of up-to-date opinion
norms and carefully controlled materials in metaphor
research.

Metaphors pervade discussions of critical issues, making up
as much as 10-20% of natural discourse. Recent work has
suggested that these conventional and systematic metaphors
influence the way people reason about the issues they
describe. For instance, Thibodeau & Boroditsky (2011, 2013)
found that people were more likely to want to fight back
against a crime beast by increasing the police force but more
likely to want to diagnose and treat a crime virus through
social reform. Here, we report two norming studies and two
experiments that reveal a shift in the overall landscape of
opinion on the topic of crime. Importantly, we find that the
metaphors continue to have an influence on people’s
reasoning about crime. Our results and analyses highlight the
importance of up-to-date opinion norms and carefully
controlled materials in metaphor research.

Introduction
Metaphors pervade discussions of critical issues, making up
as much as 10-20% of natural discourse (Steen et al., 2010).
Many metaphors are conventional and systematic (Lakoff &
Johnson, 1980). For example, we commonly use terms that
are associated with disease to talk about crime, as in “Crime
plagues and infects cities.” Further, most complex social
issues are talked about using more than one system of
metaphors. For example, in addition to disease metaphors
we can also talk about crime as a beast or wild animal, as in
“Crime attacks and preys on cities.”
Recent work (e.g., Hauser & Schwarz, 2014; Landau,
Sullivan, & Greenberg, 2009; Thibodeau & Boroditsky,
2011, 2013) has suggested that these metaphors are more
than simply colorful ways of talking. Using different
metaphors leads people to reason differently about social
issues and follow different paths of inference. For example,
when people saw a report that described crime as a beast,
they were more likely to want to fight back by increasing
the police force. When they read that crime was a virus they
preferred diagnosing and treating the problem through social
reform (Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2011, 2013).
Of course, metaphors about social issues exist in a
dynamic public discourse. As topics gain and lose
popularity, get reframed in the news cycle, and are
reconsidered in light of new events, public opinion and
public engagement on different issues can shift. In this

Participants
Data from 650 participants were collected on Mechanical
Turk using three exclusion criteria: we restricted our sample
to participants living in the US, who were at least 18 years
old, with a performance rating of at least 90%. We paid
participants $1.00.
Data from 84 (13%) participants were excluded because
they submitted an incorrect completion code or because they
reported having completed a similar study in the past. We
also excluded data from participants who reported that
English was not their first language, from participants who
reported that they did not live in the US, and from
participants who responded extremely quickly or slowly (i.e.
faster than 10 seconds or slower than 300 seconds). This left
data from 526 participants for analysis.
The average age of participants was 32.2 (sd = 10.3).
Slightly more than half were male (56%), and 38%, 46%,
and 16% identified as Democrat, Independent, and
Republican, respectively.

Materials & Design
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two framing
conditions. In one, crime was described as a virus ravaging
a city; in the other crime was described as a beast ravaging a
city. The remainder of the report was identical across
conditions.

2374

Crime is a {beast/virus} ravaging the city of Addison.
Five years ago Addison was in good shape, with no
obvious vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, in the past five
years the city’s defense systems have weakened, and
the city has succumbed to crime. Today, there are more
than 55,000 criminal incidents a year - up by more than
10,000 per year. There is a worry that if the city does
not regain its strength soon, even more serious
problems may start to develop.
After reading the report participants were asked what they
thought Addison should do to address the problem by rank
ordering the response options listed below.
1. Increase street patrols that look for criminals.
2. Increase prison sentences for convicted offenders.
3. Reform education practices and create after school
programs.
4. Expand economic welfare programs and create jobs.
5. Develop neighborhood watch programs and do more
community outreach.
The amount of time that participants spent reading and
ranking the responses was recorded. Participants were also
asked a set of background demographic questions, including
their age, sex, educational background, first language,
geographic location, and political affiliation.

Norming Study: Participants, Materials & Design
A separate group of 250 participants were asked to complete
two tasks1. In one, they were asked to rate the degree to
which each of the five policy responses emphasized
enforcement versus reform using a 101-point scale (-50 =
completely reform-oriented; 50 = completely enforcementoriented).
Participants were also asked to match policy approaches
to metaphors. They were told that two politicians were using
different metaphors (i.e. virus or beast) to support different
policy interventions for a crime problem. Participants were
presented with the five policies listed above and asked to
match each one to virus or to beast.
The order of the policy options in both of the norming
tasks was randomized. The matching task always preceded
the rating task.

Norming Results
Ratings Analyses in prior work (Steen et al., 2014;
Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2011, 2013), coded the policy
responses into two categories: those that were enforcementoriented and those that were reform-oriented. To establish
an empirical basis for this coding Thibodeau & Boroditsky
(2013) collected ratings of the five policy approaches along
a dimension of enforcement versus reform. In that study, the
1

Data from 8 participants were excluded because they submitted
an incorrect completion code.

“patrols” (M = 87.21, sd = 13.5), “prison” (M = 85.11, sd =
22.37), and “neighborhood watch” (M = 58.69, sd = 25.77)
options were viewed as enforcement-oriented (i.e. above the
midpoint, 50, of a scale that ranged from 0, very reform
oriented to 100, very enforcement-oriented). The other two
response options – “education” (M = 17.14, sd = 27.13) and
“economy” (M = 20.82, sd = 30.93) – were, on the other
hand, viewed as reform-oriented. However, Thibodeau &
Boroditsky (2013) noted that the “neighborhood watch”
“option was not rated as extreme as ‘street patrols’ or
‘prison sentences’ suggest[ing] that it may represent a more
balanced approach” (p. 4).
There are several important differences in the
sociopolitical context today (i.e. in 2014) relative to when
the initial experiments and norming studies were conducted
(i.e. between 2008 and 2011). For instance, an economic
crisis was at its peak when the initial samples were
collected. In addition, the initial studies pre-dated salient
incidents related to race, policing, and social justice that
were major news issues in 2013 and 2014. Have people’s
interpretations of the issues and stimuli changed?
We found that the options that had been rated as strongly
enforcement-oriented in the past were rated as strongly
enforcement-oriented by the current sample: “patrols” (M =
86.901, sd = 14.965), and “prison” (M = 87.479, sd =
18.351). We also found that the options that had been rated
as strongly reform-oriented in the past were rated as
strongly reform-oriented by the current sample: “economy”
(M = 14.752, sd = 21.522) and “education” (M = 15.372, sd
= 21.578).
The “neighborhood watch” option, however, was rated as
more reform-oriented (M = 36.736, sd = 28.556) in the
current study, significantly below the midpoint of the scale,
t[241] = 7.226, p < .001, and significantly different from
how it was rated in earlier studies, t[46.936; variances not
assumed to be equal; n1 = 35, n2 = 242] = 4.643, p < .001.
Note that ratings for the other four policy options did not
change significantly over this time (all ps > .2).
Matching Although the distinction between enforcement
and reform is an important one, it may not be the best way
to think about the relationship between the metaphors and
interventions. As we have argued, our theory is that the
frames should make people more likely to select policies
that are congruent with the entailments of the metaphors.
Figure 1 illustrates how participants viewed the
relationships between the policies and metaphors in the
current study2. Five separate repeated measure logistic
regressions revealed that participants were more likely to
match the “economy”, χ2(1) = 38.666, p < .001 (B = -1.694,
SE = .304, p < .001), “education”, χ2(1) = 27.07, p < .001 (B
= -1.469, SE = .308, p < .001), and “neighborhood watch”,
χ2(1) = 22.429, p < .001 (B = -1.262, SE = .284, p < .001)
2

Note that a similar norming study was reported by Thibodeau &
Boroditsky (2013); however, the “neighborhood watch” option was
not included in the response set because we had not included it as a
response option in most of our experiments.

2375

policies to the virus frame; participants were more likely to
match policies that emphasized “patrols”, χ2(1) = 37.085, p
< .001 (B = 1.269, SE = .217, p < .001), and “prison”
sentences, χ2(1) = 48.529, p < .001 (B = 1.562, SE = .241, p
< .001) to the beast frame.
This analysis suggests that policies that address the
economy, educational system, and neighborhood watches
are viewed not only as more reform-oriented but should be
coded as congruent with the virus frame. In contrast,
policies that emphasize increasing police patrols and
extending prison sentences should be coded as congruent
with the beast frame.
In several analyses below, we report the results of two
methods for coding the policies: one that is consistent with
the older set of norms (collected in 2011, reported in
Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2013), in which the
“neighborhood watch” option is categorized as consistent
with the beast metaphor; and one that is consistent with the
results of the more recent norming study, in which the
“neighborhood watch option” is categorized as consistent
with the virus metaphor.

that people with, for instance, different political affiliations
tended to think differently about crime and were affected
differently by the frames. To find the best models for the
data, we utilized a stepwise model selection algorithm from
the MASS library in R (Ripley et al., 2014). This algorithm
takes a maximally parameterized model and tests
alternatives that include subsets of predictor variables by
comparing AIC values (by both pairing down from the
maximally parameterized one and working up from the
minimally parameterized one; Jaeger, 2008; Venables &
Ripley, 2002).
For consistency, we fit the same maximally parameterized
model in every analysis, which included tests of main
effects by frame (beast or virus), time spent reading the
report, political affiliation (Democrat, Republican,
Independent), age, sex, and education and interactions
between the frame and covariates (e.g., the frame and
political affiliation). As a result, in most cases the initial
model included 14 parameters. We report the best fitting
model with an index of fit (AIC) as well as the AIC for the
maximally and minimally parameterized models.

Reanalyzing Previously Published Data
In addition to the new data collected in Experiment 1, we
also analyzed data from a very similar study conducted by
another laboratory in 2014 (Steen et al. 2014; Experiment
43). These data were collected close in time to our new
sample and norming studies (i.e. these data were collected in
August of 2014; the norming study and current experiments
were conducted in December of 2014).

Modeling Data
Many of the analyses that we report involve fitting logistic
regression models with several predictors. The primary
benefit of fitting logistic regression models is that we can
include demographic characteristics as covariates. This is
important as Thibodeau & Boroditsky (2011, 2013) found
3

Experiment 4 was the only study with a sufficiently large sample
to be able to detect an effect of metaphorical frame.

The Full Distribution of Responses We found that the
metaphor frames affected peoples’ responses on data pooled
from Experiment 4 of Steen et al.,(2014) and data from the
current Experiment 1, χ2(4, N=876) = 16.346, p = .003,
Cohen’s w = .14. Analyzed separately, we found a marginal
effect in Experiment 4, χ2(4, N=350) = 8.609, p = .072,
Cohen’s w = .16, and a significant effect in our Experiment
1, χ2(4, N=526) = 13.075, p = .011, Cohen’s w = .16 (see
Figure 2).
To determine which response option(s) drove the omnibus
effect, we conducted five post-hoc chi-square tests of
independence (α = .01): one for each response option by
constructing five separate 2 (frame: virus or beast) by 2
(option chosen: yes or no) frequency tables. This analysis
revealed that the effect was driven by the “neighborhood
watch” option, χ2(1, N=526) = 13.728, p < .001.
That is, people who read that crime was a virus were more
likely to endorse the proposal to “Develop neighborhood
watch programs and do more community outreach,” than
people who read that crime was a beast. Although the
“neighborhood watch” option was coded as enforcementoriented in prior work, and therefore congruent with the
beast frame, as we described above, it is currently viewed as
more reform-oriented and consistent with the virus frame.
In our earlier samples that included the “neighborhood
watch” option (i.e. Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2013,
Experiments 3 and 4), the overall distribution of choices
differed from that of the more recent samples (see Figure 2),
χ2(4, N = 1,400) = 61.281, p < .001. Bonferroni-corrected (α

and “prison sentences” (13.5% vs. 6.9%), χ2(1) = 19.255, p

that emphasized “neighborhood watches” (15.8% vs.
26.2%), χ2(1) = 21.646, p < .001. There was not a
significant difference in the proportion of people who
endorsed “education” (17.7% vs. 19.5%), χ2(1) = .645, p =
.422, or “street patrols” (20.6% vs. 26.3%), χ2(1) = 6.194, p

frame for three samples: a. Experiment 4 of Steen et al.
(2014); b. the current Experiment 1; and c. data pooled from
Thibodeau & Boroditsky (2013) Experiments 3 and 4. Error
bars denote 95% confidence intervals.
This difference suggests that there may have been a
cultural shift in how people conceptualize aspects of crime
(including neighborhood watch programs, prison, and
policing), the economy, and education over the past six
years.
To understand how these cultural shifts may have affected
the interpretation of results reported in Steen et al., (2014)

as either enforcement- or reform-oriented we dichotomized
the responses according to both sets of opinion norms.
Coded Responses When data from Steen et al., (2014) and
our Experiment 1 were coded according to 2011 opinion
norms, with the “neighborhood watch” option categorized
as enforcement-oriented and consistent with the beast
metaphor, we did not find the predicted effect of the
metaphor frame (AIC = 1164.2; AICMax = 1192.6; AICMin =
1194.6).
In fact, on this coding scheme, people who read that
crime was a virus appear more enforcement-oriented (B =
1.031, SE = .478, p = .031), as do older participants (B =
0.042, SE = .011, p < .001), and Republicans (who appear
more enforcement-oriented
than Democrats, B = .791, SE =
0.4
.220, p < .001, and Independents, B = .537, SE = .218, p =
.014).
That is, the apparent effect of the metaphor frame was
exactly the reverse of what we found in prior work. To
examine whether0.2 this apparent discrepancy was due to an
outdated coding scheme, we examined the same data but
this time coding the responses according to new norming
data (AIC = 1060.9; AICMax = 1074.0; AICMin 1096.7).
This model revealed an effect of the metaphor frame in

consistent with the virus metaphor (i.e. to be more reformoriented), B = -.474, SE = 231, p = .041: 34.0% of
participants who read that crime was a beast chose an
enforcement-oriented response compared to 29.6% of
participants who read that crime was a virus. Participants
were 4.9 and 5.1 percentage points more likely to choose an
enforcement-oriented response in Steen et al., (2014)’s
Experiment 4 and our Experiment 1, respectively.
In addition, Republicans were more likely to be
enforcement-oriented than Independents, B = .888, SE .208,
p < .001, and Democrats, B = 1.008, SE = .213, p < .001. On
average, Republicans choose an enforcement-oriented
response 50.7% of the time; Independents and Democrats
choose an enforcement-oriented response 29.6% and 26.6%
of the time, respectively.
Separate analyses on the data from Experiment 4 of Steen
et al., (2014) and the current Experiment 1 reveal consistent
results. Both data sets show the predicted effect of
metaphorical frame on people’s policy preferences,
replicating prior findings (Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2013).
The apparent discrepancy reported in Steen et al., (2014)
was introduced because the coding scheme relied on
outdated opinion norms.

Experiment 2
To further investigate the reliability of the framing effect
and to ensure that it could be elicited in the absence of the
relatively ambiguous “neighborhood watch” option, we
conducted a follow-up experiment in which participants
were asked to choose between two policy approaches.

2377

Participants
Data from 650 participants were collected on Mechanical
Turk, using the same exclusion criteria as in Experiment 1.
Data from 109 participants were excluded for one of the
reasons listed in Experiment 1, leaving data from 521
participants for analysis.
The average age of participants was 32.6 (sd = 10.9).
Slightly more than half were male (53%), and 41%, 43%,
and 16% identified as Democrat, Independent, and
Republican, respectively.

Materials & Design
The materials and design for Experiment 2 were identical to
those of Experiment 1, except that participants were asked
to choose between two policy responses: “patrols” and
“education”. We chose these two policy options because
they clearly differed along the two relevant dimensions: the
“patrols” option was viewed as more consistent with the
beast frame and more enforcement-oriented; the
“education” option was viewed as more consistent with the
virus frame and more reform-oriented. In addition, both of
these response options were widely endorsed in previous
experiments, unlike, for instance, the “prison” option.

Results
In this case, we found that 54.4% of policy preferences were
congruent with the metaphor frame (i.e. on coding the
“patrols” option as congruent with the beast metaphor and
the “education” option as congruent with virus), χ2(1, N =
521) = 4.240, p = .039, w = .09. Republicans were more
enforcement-oriented than Democrats, B = .921, SE = .282,
p = .001, and Independents were more enforcement-oriented
than Democrats, B = .538, SE = .197, p = .006 (AIC =
702.5; AICMax = 714.0 AICMin = 712.2).
That is, 61.0% of participants who read that crime was a
beast preferred a policy that emphasized increasing
“patrols” over reforming “education.” In contrast, 53.4% of
participants who read that crime was a virus preferred the
enforcement-oriented policy. For context, 70.7% of
Republicans, 61.1% of Independents, and 48.8% of
Democrats preferred the enforcement-oriented approach.

General Discussion
In summary, these analyses reveal a reliable effect of a
metaphor frame on a policy judgment: on both coded and
raw (i.e. uncoded) data. In Experiment 1 people who read
that crime was a virus were more likely to view the
“neighborhood watch” option as the most effective policy
approach compared to people who read that crime was a
beast. In Experiment 2, we found that the metaphor framing
effect did not rely solely on the presence of this response
option.
One additional conclusion that can be drawn from these
experiments is that it can difficult to study framing in a
dynamic real-world context. The issue of crime is
consistently a focal issue in the media, although the way it is

covered changes in predictable and unpredictable ways
depending on the media outlet and as a result of salient
events and political cycles (e.g., Barak, 1995). These
variables can have profound effects on the way people think
about crime (e.g., Iyengar, 1994). As a result, it is important
to consider the possibility that variability in the cultural
context may affect the way that metaphors influence
reasoning for real-world issues by, for instance, using
within-sample norming studies to gauge the degree to which
people view policies as consistent with frames.

Can we tell which of the two metaphors (or both)
are doing the work?
The results so far inform us that there is a psychological
difference between the two metaphorical frames. However
they do not tell us how the metaphors are shaping people’s
views relative to what they would have thought without a
metaphor. Are both metaphors equally contributing to the
separation of opinion in the two conditions, or is just one of
the metaphors doing all the work? It is also possible, for
example, that both beast and virus metaphors make people
more enforcement-oriented than they would have been
without the metaphors, but the effect of the beast metaphor
is stronger. Likewise, it is possible that both the beast and
virus metaphors make people more reform-oriented than
they would have been without the metaphors, but the effect
of the virus metaphor is stronger.
These questions raise an interesting conundrum. What is
an appropriate baseline that we can use to measure against?
One possibility is to ask people for a policy preference
before exposing them to the manipulation (i.e. to include a
pre-test; e.g., as in Steen et al., 2014’s Experiments 1 and 2).
There are several problems with this approach. For instance,
if the pre- and post-test measures are taken close to each
other in time, with participants being asked the same
questions twice, the design becomes vulnerable to strategic
decisions on the part of the participants (i.e. participants
may feel anchored to their initial judgment or pressured to
change their preference).
A second possible approach to gauging a baseline is to
compare the metaphor framing conditions to a “neutral” or
“non-metaphorical” framing condition. However, this path
too is problematic: How would one establish that any
alternative framing is indeed “neutral” with respect to the
two metaphorical conditions?
For example, suppose we replace “Crime is a beast/virus
ravaging the city of Addison” with “Crime is a problem
ravaging the city of Addison” (as in Steen et al., 2014).
There are two concerns.
1) How do we know that problem is not in fact more
similar to one of the two metaphors? For example, if we
were to find that responses to the beast frame are the same
as to the problem frame, are we licensed to conclude that it
is the virus frame that affects people’s thinking? Clearly not.
All we would know is that the beast frame and the problem
frame are similar, and that the virus frame is different from
both of them. Since there is no external standard by which

2378

we could judge the problem frame as neutral, comparing it
to the other two conditions doesn’t get us any closer to
answering which of the frames may or may not have more
of an effect on reasoning.
2) Linguistic stimuli are complex and people’s responses
to linguistic stimuli depend strongly on many properties
such as frequency, vividness, conventionality, emotional
valence, arousal and so on. Replacing beast or virus with
problem introduces a host of uncontrolled changes along
these dimensions. The same issue holds if one simply
removes the words beast or virus to make “Crime is
ravaging the city of Addison.” That is, replacing or
removing the key metaphorical nouns does not make a
neutral stimulus, it makes a different stimulus.
To illustrate the difficulty of constructing an appropriate
“neutral” comparison frame, we collected data in a second
norming study. Participants in this task (N = 248) were
asked to judge the severity, conventionality, and
metaphoricity of three “Crime is a …” frames: virus, beast,
and problem.
We found that people rated the problem frame not only as
less metaphorical than the virus or beast frames (paired
sample t-tests revealed differences between the metaphor
and problem frames, ps < .001), but also as connoting a less
severe crime problem (ps < .001) and differing in
conventionality (ps < .001) (see Table 1).
Table 1 Mean ratings of three “Crime is a …” frames (sd)
Severity
Metaphoricity Conventionality
Beast
79.6 (17.0)
88.7 (13.9)
33.4 (24.1)
Virus
78.0 (15.9)
86.6 (16.0)
40.1 (26.1)
Problem
58.1 (26.8)
22.2 (25.5)
88.4 (15.3)
These ratings suggest that a problem frame differs from
the virus and beast frames in a variety of ways. It is not only
less metaphorical than the other two. But it connotes a less
severe instance of crime and is viewed as a more
conventional expression.
In contrast, the beast and virus frames are rated as
connoting a similarly severe instance of crime, and are
viewed as similarly conventional expressions.
As a result, we can be confident that differences in
participants’ policy preferences elicited by the virus and
beast frames do not stem from differences in the degree to
which the frames are metaphorical or connote a severe
instance of crime. However, a problem frame fails to control
for these important linguistic variables.

Conclusion
With two norming studies and two experiments, we further
explored a metaphor framing effect in an important and
dynamic real world context: crime. The two norming studies
highlight critical factors for researchers to keep in mind
when conducting framing studies in real world contexts. The
first reveals the importance of using up-to-date norming
data; the second illustrates limitations of comparing
metaphorical to non-metaphorical frames.

The two experiments replicate prior work (Thibodeau &
Boroditsky, 2011, 2013) and pinpoint the cause of a
reported null effect (Steen et al., 2014). The first experiment
shows that people are more likely to pursue enforcementoriented policy interventions when crime is framed as a
beast compared to when crime is framed as a virus.
However, this experiment included a relatively ambiguous
policy option – “neighborhood watches.” In a follow-up
experiment that excluded this option, we again found a
reliable metaphor framing effect, showing that the effect of
the metaphors did not depend on the presence of an
ambiguous policy response.
In sum, the results confirm that natural language
metaphors can affect the way we reason about complex
problems.
