A might feel inadequate because the relationship can be ex-

   So far, these are only speculations as to how far our find-
ings may generalize which still need to be empirically tested
with materials outside the domain of human agency. In case
of success, this account may be applicable not only to as-
pects of everyday causal cognition, but even to psychological
processes underlying scientific theory construction. When-
ever a scientific theory is about a causal chain structure (e.g.,
process X influences process Y, which in turn leads to effect
Z), the issue discussed in this paper arises: if the researcher
wants to assess whether process X per se explains outcome
Z, should she hold process Y constant? If she conceives of
process Y as a mediator, the answer is definitely no. But
there might be cases in which, despite the underlying chain
structure, she conceives of process Y as an alternative expla-
nation of effect Z. Sometimes, it does not seem clear which
of these conceptualizations is more adequate—yet, the deci-
sion for one of them will crucially shape the methodology
and conclusions of the subsequent research (e.g., decisions
about whether process Y is to be controlled or to be left free
to covary with X).
