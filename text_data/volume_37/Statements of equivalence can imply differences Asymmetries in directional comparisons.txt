was asked to decide between women and men. The order of
the four trials was counterbalanced across participants, and
the order of the two genders that participants were asked to
choose from was counterbalanced both across and within
participants. After participating, participants received a
debriefing message explaining that in real life, both genders
are good at the same activities.
   The Effort condition was identical to the Effort Baseline
condition, except that the sentences used were different, as
described above, and required further counterbalancing.
Each participant in the Effort condition was presented with
two sentences that framed either girls or women as the
figure and two sentences that framed either boys or men as
the figure. For half of the participants, girls or women were
framed as the figure for the game and the puzzle, and for the
other half of the participants, girls or women were framed as
the figure for the sport and the dance. To ensure that an            Figure 2: The proportion of participants choosing males

Materials The materials were identical to those used in
Study 2A.
Procedure The procedure was identical to study 2A, except
that questions targeted natural skill rather than effort (e.g.,
“Who do you think is more naturally skilled at quibbing?”).
Thus, participants participated in either the Skill condition or
the Skill Baseline condition.
Results and Discussion
To assess whether directional comparisons intended to
express equivalent ability further imply that the group in the
ground position has more natural skill, we now asked,
“Who do you think is more naturally skilled at [gorp]?”
   The dependent measure was the proportion of times
participants stated that men or boys had more natural skill.
We predicted that this number would be greater when men                 Figure 3: The proportion of participants choosing males
