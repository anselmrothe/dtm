                          Introduction
Foraging is an embodied cognitive process. Animals move
continuously through physical space searching for food,
mates, or other resources. Increasingly, evidence indicates
that common neurophysiological mechanisms support a
broad range of search behaviors. Thus, cognitive search tasks
such as visual search, problem solving, and semantic recall
share many of the mechanisms and constraints of foraging
(Hills, Todd, Lazer, Redish, & Couzin, 2014).
   Much of the prior work on foraging has analyzed it as a
statistical process rather than the product of embedded,
interactive systems. This approach has produced effective               Figure 1: An example area-restricted search produced by a

   Viswanathan (1999) presents a formal analysis and
evidence from numerical simulations that Lèvy flights are
optimal foraging strategies when resources are sparse and
randomly distributed. Alternatively, when resources are
patchy and therefore the mean resource density within and
between patches can be learned, the marginal-value theorem
predicts transitions between behavioral regimes (Charnov,
1976). To test whether different neural models lead to
different rates of resource collection, we record a resource
collection event whenever a foraging agent gets within a
fixed spatial distance from a point resource. That resource is
subsequently removed from the environment.
