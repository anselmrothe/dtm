Abstract

accountability with respect to predicting the grades or ranks
of learners (e.g., Charness, Tuffiash, Krampe, Reingold, &
Vasyukova, 2005)．
On the other hand, only a few studies cast doubt upon this
concept regarding its generality. For example, Macnamara,
Hambrick, and Oswald (2014) classified various domains
treated in studies of deliberate practice based on
predictability of the environment surrounding the task and
investigated the accountability of deliberate practice. The
study showed that in domains of low predictability (like
team sports and piloting), deliberate practice poorly
accounted for performance, with limited effect size. In
addition, as discussed by Oura (1996) and Schön (1983),
experts tend to acquire flexibility and adaptability in skill
usage by reflecting and monitoring their practice as well as
by gathering feedback to revise their solutions in
environments with highly variable task demands requiring
creative solutions. These studies suggested that in domains
that have low predictability and need creative solutions,
deliberate practice does not completely account for the
process of developing expertise. As such, there seems to be
different types of practice involved in low-predictability and
creative domains.

This study investigated the longitudinal process of practice
by an expert dancer in breakdance. We examined the ability
of the concept of “deliberate practice” (Ericsson, Krampe, &
Tesch-Römer, 1993) to provide a full account of the practice
process of an expert dancer. We conducted a fieldwork study
to observe the practice of expert dancers under natural
conditions, and analyzed data gathered from video and
interviews for the progress of a dancer’s proficiency at a
particular skill with respect to the following three points:
number of rotations in the skill, contents of the skill, and
purposes of the skill practices. Results indicated that the
practice process involved not only refining the quality of the
skill, but also two other activities: the exploration of new and
original skills utilizing the characteristics of that skill, and
choreographing that skill so that it could fit into his full
performance. The practice process of experts is a complicated
and creative one, which cannot be sufficiently explained by
the concept of “deliberate practice” alone.

Introduction
Deliberate practice
How do experts in domains of physical expression, such as
dance, develop original and outstanding performance? Many
studies in cognitive science have focused on practice in
various domains like chess, music, and sports, and identified
processes important to developing expertise (Ericsson,
Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993; Oura, 1996; Schön, 1983).
Among the identified processes, “deliberate practice” has
been identified as the most important to improving one’s
skills (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993). Ericsson
and Lehman (1996) pointed out that, often alongside
immediate feedback from coaches or teachers, people
gradually develop expertise through engaging in many years
of practice that is carefully structured with the aim of
progressively mastering appropriate tasks. They named this
“deliberate practice”. Many researchers have studied
deliberate practice in various domains such as games, sports,
education, and piloting (Macnamara, Hambrick, & Oswald,
2014). For example, using multiple regression analysis,
some studies have shown that deliberate practice has high

Goal of This Study
In order to capture such a process, we investigated the
practice of expert dancers in the domain of breakdance, in
which low predictability and the need for creative solutions
are core features, using a longitudinal fieldwork method.
Breakdance is very popular in many countries these days.
In breakdance, dancers need to perform impromptu, taking
into consideration many uncertain factors such as codancers, audience, judges, and music played and changed by
DJs (Shimizu & Okada, 2013a). Furthermore, criteria for
evaluation are highly subjective and in competition settings
are left in the judges’ hands. Under such dynamic conditions,
expert dancers need to create original and fascinating
performances.
To capture such dynamic practice processes, we used a
fieldwork method, involving participant observation and
interview, especially focusing on the process of the

development of a particular skill. Although laboratory
experiments would certainly be advantageous for
controlling the conditions of observation, we thought that
the laboratory setting was not suited to our goal. To account
for the flexible and creative nature of expert practice in
breakdance, we needed to observe expert practice sessions
in a highly natural setting.

Methods
Participant observation
We conducted participant observation from July to
November 2011 (14 practice sessions were observed
resulting in about 40 hours of observation). The subjects of
observation were three dancers who have won 1st to 4th prize
in a breakdance battle tournament in Japan, each having
about eight to nine years of experience in breakdance. Their
practice sessions were recorded by two video cameras and
an IC recorder (see Fig.1). In this study, we focused on
footage of Expert-A, who practiced a particular skill many
times (a total of 197 times).

Interview of Expert-A
We also conducted a follow-up structured interview with
Expert-A in March 2014 over about three hours. In the
interview, Expert-A watched 197 video records of his
practice of the particular skill and answered two questions in
response to each records; one referred to the contents of
each skill performance, and the other referred to the
purposes of each skill practice. We recorded his interview
with video cameras and an IC recorder.

Coding by Expert-B
Furthermore, to code the content of the observational data of
the skills of Expert-A, we asked another expert dancer
(Expert-B) to view the video records for about three hours
in May 2014. Like the interview of Expert-A, Expert-B
watched the 197 video records of the practice of Expert-A,
and identified the contents of the skill each time it was
performed. We recorded his coding with video cameras and
an IC recorder.

The skill we focused on in this study is called “Inside
Ninety” (abbreviated “I.N.” in this study, see Fig. 2). In
this skill, established in the late 20th century, a dancer
rotates their body in a one-handed handstand. Expert-A
described that he was confident about his proficiency in
this skill, especially in terms of ability to perform the
number of rotations desired.

Analyses
In this study, we analyze the process of skill practice from
three points of view to investigate the flexible and creative
nature of expert practice: 1) number of rotations in the skill,
2) contents of the skill performance, and 3) purpose of the
skill practice. Some studies regarding skill practice
emphasize that to fully capture the varied and complicated
process of skill acquisition, indicators concerning only
proficiency or smoothness of the skill are not sufficient (e.g.,
Haibach, Daniels, & Newell, 2005). We think that by
analyzing the contents and purposes of the skill
performances, the creative nature of expert practice can be
uncovered.
Number of rotations in the skill We counted the number
of rotations performed as part of the skill in each of the
197 video records as an indicator of the degree of skill
acquisition. The first author, who has ten years of
experience in breakdance, coded the number of rotations
in each of the 197 videos with half-rotations as the
minimum unit.
Contents of the skill performances Next, we
investigated the contents of the skill in each trial to
analyze its variations and development. Our previous
study on breakdance skill practice (Shimizu & Okada,
2013b) showed that another dancer practicing a particular
skill as part of a full performance tried to change various
aspects of the skill, such as the preparation, main, and
terminal parts of the skill. Based on these findings, we
divided the I.N. into three parts (the point before the
rotation, the point of rotation, and the point after the
rotation), and identified the contents of each part. Firstly,
the first author checked all 197 videos of Expert-A’s
practices and coded the contents of each performance of
the skill. Then, he compared that data with the coding of

Purposes of the skill practices We analyzed the purposes
of Expert-A’s skill practices to identify the intentions
directing the practice. Similar purposes gathered from the
interview data of Expert-A were integrated, generating
five coding categories (see Table 2). We checked the
reliability of our coding by asking a graduate student who

did not know the purpose of this study to code the data.
The κ coefficient was 0.88 (consistency rate of 92.1%
between the first author and the graduate student).
However, the validity of this data is somewhat limited
because the interview for Expert-A was conducted only
after much time had passed since participant observation.
Therefore, we mainly focused on the analysis of the
contents of the skill performance, while trying to show the
validity of this analysis by checking for consistency
between the contents and the purpose of the skill
performance.

Contents of the skill performances
We show the coding categories of the contents of the skill
performances in Table 11. This table shows that Expert-A
conducted 17 variations of the skill. Furthermore, Expert-A
changed various aspects of the skill, such as the point of
rotation, and the specific contents before and after rotations
(see Fig. 3). These results indicate that Expert-A conducted
divergent and explorative practices to create many
variations utilizing the established skill, “I.N.”.

Expert-A gradually created many types of variations while
simultaneously refining the basic style.
Furthermore, with respect to the chronology of the practice
sessions, Expert-A started to make more variations after the
7th day. Also, as Expert-A engaged in further practice (see
the 7th day and 11th day), he created many variations with
reference to the variations he generated during preceding
practices (see circled items in Fig. 4 and bold items in Table
1). These results indicated that Expert-A started to create
many variations only after having sufficiently practiced the
skill (in his case, after 7 days), and he created the new
variations actively referring to previous variations.

Purposes of the skill practices
We show the coding categories of the purposes of the skill
practice in Table 2. Expert-A had multiple purposes
intended for each practice, such as divergent practice
(creating many variations utilizing the characteristics of the
skill), convergent practice (refining the quality of the skill),
and integrative practice (arranging the skill to fit into his full
performance). This result is consistent with the results from

Simon (1972) to create Fig. 4.

the observations regarding skill content in the previous
section, which indicated that Expert-A created many
variations of the skill.

Relationship between the contents of the skill
performances and the purposes of the skill practice
As shown in Table 3, the data suggested that when Expert-A
intended to refine the quality of the skill (convergent
practice), he used basic style 2, whereas when his purpose
was to integrate the skill into his full performance, he used
basic style 1. When Expert-A sought to create many
variations, he conducted 15 kinds of variations (see
variations in the contents in Table 3). These results showed
that the purposes and contents of the skill practices were
related.

General Discussion
This study investigated the practice process of an expert in a
domain that has low predictability and requires creative
solutions. We selected breakdance as the domain of study,
and conducted longitudinal fieldwork. Based on our results,
we uncovered two points.

2156

1: First, the expert engaged in not only convergent practice
to refine the quality of the skill, but also divergent practice
to create many variations utilizing the characteristics of the
skill, and integrative practice to choreograph the skill to fit
into his full performance.
2: Second, divergent practice was started only after
prolonged practice. Furthermore, when the expert conducted
divergent practice, he actively referred to and utilized the
previous variations he had created.
These findings tell us that in a domain with low
predictability and a need for creative solutions, the expert
dancer engaged in fairly complicated and creative practices.
He not only repeated and refined the existing skill, but also
paid attention to the relationships between that skill, his
knowledge, and other skills, allowing him to create new
skills. This practice process cannot be fully accounted for by
the concept of “deliberate practice”, which emphasizes
repetitive practices that are carefully structured and often
provided by teachers or coaches. Since exploration of new
ideas and new skills is essential in expert practices in
creative domains, deliberately structured practices cannot be
prepared in advance. An expert’s practice in such a creative
domain needs to be personally developed in situ with an
explorative approach in order to generate a creative
performance. This point of view is consistent with the
discussion of Kapur (2008), which emphasizes the
importance of explorative attempts and variability of
contents in the practice process to become an adaptive
expert explained by Hatano & Inagaki (1986). The
importance of variability in the contents of practice is also
supported by a constraints-led approach, which accounts for
the skill acquisition process in various domains from a
dynamical systems model (e.g., Chow, Davids, Hristovski,
Araújo, & Passos, 2011). Further research is needed to
generalize and integrate our findings with those in related
domains.
