Methods
Iterated learning of color. Xu et al. (2013) trained an
initial generation of 20 participants on random partitions of
color space into 3-6 categories, and then asked them to
recall those categories by labeling a set of color chips
accordingly. The next set of 20 participants each studied the
assignment of labels to color chips of a single first
generation learner, and created their own labelings in turn,
which were then used to train the subsequent generation.             Figure 2: Average distance to WCS languages (red; left y-
