   Participants in the CT group were on average more moves
away from the rational order of universities than participants
in the UT group (M=1.63, SD=1.553 and M=1.15,
SD=1.302); this difference is significant when participants
with impairments are excluded (t[94] = 2.241, p = .027;
M=1.60, SD=1.594 and M=1.02, SD=1.080, respectively).
Choice according to subjective utility
In the CT condition, participants chose according to their
own weighting preferences (78.0% chose B over C) not
differently than in the UT condition (77.0% chose B over C;
χ2[1, 120] = 0.014, p =.904). There are no significant
differences between those participants who made the best
choice (A=1st Choice; CT: 73.3%, UT: 79.1%) and those
who made an inferior choice (χ2[1,120] = 0.066, p = .797).
Chance level
All four measures in both groups were significantly
different from the chance levels (all binomial and t-tests p <
.01).
Individual Differences
Of all individual differences (age, first language,
student/employment, course [if applicable], ethnicity,
handedness), only gender showed an effect and is discussed
in the following.
Gender
There was a tendency for male participants to decide more
rationally (71.4% vs. 55.1%). This is, however, not
significant (χ2[1]=3.044, p=.081). In detail it can be seen,
that (1) female participants did better in the UT than in the
CT condition regarding A=1st choice (70.0% vs. 39.5%,
χ2[1,120] = 7.341, p = .007), number of positive attributes
(M = 7.30, SD = 1.159 vs. M = 6.53, SD = 1.370, t[76] =
2.685, p = .009) and necessary moves (M = 1.05, SD =
1.037 vs. M = 1.74, SD = 1.622, p = .03), but not regarding
B before C; (2) Male participants did equally well in both
thought conditions (both 71.4%). Thus, the UTT effect is
solely driven by female participants. In the UT condition,
men were at chance in choosing B over C, but required
fewer moves to get to the correct order.
                         Discussion
This study replicated the UT effect in a large sample where
each participant weighted attributes individually, ensuring
options were the best or worst according to both objective
and subjective standards. Gender had an effect on the
rationality of decision-making.
UT effect
In this study, a significant UT advantage was found on all
three measurements used (but there was no difference in                Figure 1. Results across all groups and gender. Within-
