Abstract
This study aims to further investigate the Unconscious
Thought Theory (UTT, Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006),
namely whether individual differences account for differences
in choice made after either deliberation (conscious thought,
CT) or distraction (unconscious thought, UT). Also,
subjective weighting was considered and choice options were
constructed following individual preferences, hence avoiding
choices biased by differences in preferences. The main effect
was replicated with a big sample (N=120, CT: 50.8%, UT:
70.5% chose the best alternative), using four different
dependent measures. The results show further that the main
effect is driven by underperformance of women in the CT
condition. Stereotype threat is discussed as a possible
explanation.

Introduction
“All decisions share several common features: They are
conscious. They are voluntary. They are intended to bring
about outcomes the decision maker prefers over other
outcomes.” (Yates, 1990, p. 3). All decisions are conscious.
But is that true?

Normative Theory
According to normative theories of decision making (e.g.
Baron, 2004), people evaluate all options and choose the
option with the highest (expected) subjective utility. The
goal of every decision is to maximise the expected return
and the way to get to this decision is made in rational, hence
predictable and consistent, steps (e.g., LeBoeuf, & Shafir,
2005). Expected-utility theory (EUT), for example, states
that the expected utility is calculated by multiplying the
utility of each possible outcome by its probability and
summing across all outcomes (Baron, 2004). Thus, the best
decision is the one that yields best consequences over all
possible outcomes. However, human subjects show
violations from predictions of normative theory.

Violations of Normative Theory
Lichtenstein and Slovic (1971) and Lindman (1971), for
example, found a preference-reversal according to two
conditions (choice and pricing of two bids, respectively),
thus violating the invariance principle. Another example of
violation is the framing effect: the same set of information

presented differently leads to different decisions (e.g.,
Tversky & Kahneman, 1981).
Prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; later also
cumulative prospect theory, Tversky & Kahneman, 1992), a
descriptive model of human decision-making, takes these
violations into account. Central to the theory is that utility is
measured against a reference point (the current state, and
not the sum of all experienced events), thus explaining why
behavior changes as the reference point changes. It can also
explain loss aversion, i.e., a higher sensitivity to potential
losses than to potential gains, which normative theories
cannot. In addition, subjects weight the outcomes not by an
alternative’s objective probability, but by transformed
probabilities.
In addition, subjects are bound by several external (e.g.
time, information) and internal (e.g. attention, memory
capacity) factors (Simon, 1955), thus leading to bounded
rationality (Simon, 1956). Especially restrictions in working
memory (even more so under time pressure) challenge
rationality. In contrast to single-process models (Osman,
2004), dual-process models accommodate for these
limitations by treating reason and intuition as two different
cognitive modes that lead to different results (e.g. Chaiken
& Trope, 1999). Commonly understood, reason (also
referred to as “System 2”) is effortful and requires conscious
evaluation, whereas intuition (“System 1”) responds quickly
using mental shortcuts (i.e. heuristics, Gigerenzer, 2004).
Hence, deliberation is part of reason, while intuition is
prone to systematic biases and errors. Ideally, System 2
monitors System 1’s decisions and intervenes if necessary.
In multi-attribute decision making–the focus of this
study–common heuristics are described as either
compensatory or non-compensatory. Compensatory
heuristics rely on weighting all attributes (e.g., as a sum of
values, choosing the highest; Dawes, 1979), whereas noncompensatory heuristics rely on differences in relation to
single cues.

Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT)
The theory of decision-making as presented above, suggests
that anything other than dedicated deliberation is an inferior
strategy used in limited environments (e.g., time pressure,
limited access to information). Deliberation, however does
not always lead to the expected best outcome. Wilson and
Schooler (1991) found that the rating of a set of jams by

2416

non-experts was closer to that of experts when done
intuitively than after deliberating the reasons for the rating.
Dijksterhuis and Nordgren (2006), based on earlier
findings (Dijksterhuis, 2004; but see also: Dijksterhuis, Bos,
Nordgren, & van Baaren, 2006; Dijksterhuis & van Olden,
2006), proposed the Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT).
UTT states that complex decisions made unconsciously (i.e.
when distracted from conscious thought) are more accurate
than decisions made consciously (i.e. with effortful thinking
about the task at hand). What they describe as unconscious
thought is neither ‘System 1’ nor ‘System 2’ but lies
somewhere in between. Thus, they suggest a ‘triad-process
model’ described as “an effortless route that involves no
thought at all, an unconscious route that takes time but is
relatively effortless, and a conscious route that is effortful”
(Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006, p. 104).
The standard paradigm of the UTT is as follows: In
Dijksterhuis (2004), participants were asked to evaluate
three or four options (e.g. apartments, room mates; each
described with 12-15 features so that one was
predominantly positive, one predominantly negative and
one or two neutral). One group did so immediately after
they had read the descriptions (immediate condition), one
after three minutes of conscious thought (deliberation
condition) and a third after three minutes of distraction
(unconscious thought, distraction condition). The last,
Dijksterhuis (2004) argued, was not only distracted but also
engaged in unconscious thought, i.e. thinking without
attention. The surprising findings showed that those
participants engaging in ‘unconscious thought’ made not
only better, i.e. more rational, decisions than those in the
immediate condition, but also better decisions than those in
the conscious condition (significant difference in
Experiments 2 & 3; not significant in Experiment 1).

(Shafir & LeBoeuf, 2004), and attribute weights often
change systematically despite the normative assumptions
that preferences should remain stable (LeBoeuf & Shafir,
2005). Thus, linear models are often seen as normatively
better predictions (Dawes, 1979; Dawes, Faust, & Meehl,
1989). Nevertheless, in the fourth principle of UTT,
Dijksterhuis and Nordgren (2006) state that in most cases
(i.e. when no arithmetic rules have to be followed) UT
outperforms CT in consistency and accuracy in accordance
with subjective utility.
In most studies, weighting has not been targeted and,
where it has, has been done in a pilot study or after the
decision task. Dijksterhuis (2004, experiment 3), for
example, evaluated the most important attributes in a pilot
study and asked participants to rate the attributes according
to their individual preference after the decision and a four
minutes distractor task. A preference score was calculated
for each participant and then correlated with the difference
score of attitude in choice with a high correlation showing
that the participant chose according to their own weighting.
A significant correlation was found for UT (r[41] = .48, p =
.002) but not for CT (r[47] = .21, p = .17).
However, studies that obtained subjective weighting after
the main task comment that rating before the task could
possibly increase “the potential for all participants to
approach the experiment in a more ‘analytic’ (conscious)
frame of mind, thus […] hampering unconscious thought”
(Newell et al., 2009, p. 728). In Aczel, Lukacs, Komlos, and
Aitken (2011), however, weighting was done by half of the
participants before the main task and again by all
participants after the task. In contrast to the Dijksterhuis
(2004) findings, they found a significant correlation for CT
(r[24] = .364, p = .040 [one-tailed] but not for UT (r[24] =
.254, p = .116 [one-tailed]).2

Critique and Meta-Analysis

Gender differences

The UTT itself is debated in the literature (e.g. GonzálezVallejo, Lassiter, Bellezza, & Lindberg, 2008; Newell &
Shanks, 2014; Payne, Samper, Bettman, & Luce, 2008;
Waroquier, et al., 2009). Four meta-analyses have been
published so far (Acker, 2008; Nieuwenstein, & van Rijn,
2012; Nieuwenstein, et al., 2015; Strick et al., 2011), with
the most recent comprising 61 experiments from 31 studies,
showing a small but significant UT effect.1
In summary, results of the meta-analyses showed at best a
modest benefit for UT. The mechanisms behind the UTT
effect, however, are still not sufficiently explained. Several
explanations are possible, of which memory effects,
weighting and gender differences are part of the current
study.

Amongst the explanations for the variability of the UTT
effect, personal differences in general and gender in
particular are discussed (Acker, 2008; Nieuwenstein, & van
Rijn, 2012). Most commonly, female participants show little
or no variation among the UT, CT and immediate conditions
(Dijksterhuis 2004, exp. 1 & 3, Thornsteinson and Withrow,
2009, exp. 2). Although significant gender differences have
repeatedly been observed, no clear pattern has been found
(Nieuwenstein & van Rijn, 2012).

Role of Weighting
Generally, weighting in human judgment is seen as mostly
unreliable and highly susceptible to basic manipulations

Method
Participants
120 volunteers (Age M = 27.9, SD = 9.10, 42 male,
57.5% English natives, 82.5% students, the majority in
undergraduate Psychology courses) from the University of
London, Birkbeck College, participated in the experiment.

The effect disappeared when a trim-and-fill procedure was
used, as a publication bias was assumed.

Unfortunately, they did not report if there were any differences
in choices made by those who rated attributes before and after the
task or afterwards only.

2417

Participants received either course credits or a monetary
reward (£5). Ten participants reported some form of
impairment3 at the start of the experiment, but did not report
any problems during the trial. The main effect did not
change when these participants were excluded (if anything,
exclusion favoured the UT effect). Thus, it was decided not
to exclude those participants, but, where relevant, results are
presented including and excluding those ten participants.

Design
Participants were randomly assigned to one of six
conditions in the 2 x 3 factorial design4.

Material
The attributes used for the experiment were aspects that
were deemed relevant when applying for a university. From
a total of 58 different attributes acquired in a pilot study, the
20 most frequently reported were chosen for the experiment.
Four universities were constructed with 12 attributes each,
differing in number of positive and negative attributes, as
defined by the participant. A was the most positive with 8
positive and 4 negative attributes, D was the reversed and B
and C both had 6 positive and 6 negative attributes, with B
taking the top 6 as positive attributes and C taking the top 6
as negative attributes.

Procedure
All participants were tested individually in the testing room.
At the start of the experiment, the purpose of the study was
explained and written informed consent obtained. A short
questionnaire about demographics was filled in by
experimenter and participant together.
The actual experiment was divided into two parts with
three distractor tasks in between. In the first part, the
participants were asked to rank-order the 20 attributes
describing general aspects of universities from most to least
important, according to their own judgment. The order was
the basis for the second part and entered into the computer
while participants were occupied by the third distractor
task.5 All three distractor tasks are highly demanding, thus

i.e., Dyslexia, migraine, epilepsy, hearing impairment.

A memory manipulation was included, but due to space
limitations results are not reported here. Therefore, only
differences between UT and CT groups are considered in the
remainder (N =120).
5
The first distractor task was the Animal Fluency Task, a
variation of the Verbal Fluency Task (Bousfield & Sedgewick,
1944). For 120 seconds participants had to name as many animals
as possible. The second task was a Random Number Generation
task (Wagenaar, 1972). Here, participants had to say digits from 1
to 10 in random order, one a second for 100 seconds in pace with a
metronome. The third task was a sheet with 24 reasoning puzzles
assessing verbal problem solving ability. Participants had to find
one of three or four objects with a certain attribute (e.g. “Jamie ate
less than Susan, but Neal ate more than Susan. Who ate the
least?”). The time limit was set at five minutes and the instruction
was to do as many puzzles as possible.

suitable as distractor tasks. Including instructions, they took
up only about ten to 15 minutes and hence did not tire the
participants.
In the second part of the experiment, participants were
made familiar with the names of four fictional universities.
They were instructed that each university would be
described by 12 attributes, appearing one by one on the
screen in random order. The instruction was to memorise
the attributes as well as possible, so as to make a good
decision later on. The attributes were then presented on
screen, for 4s each with 0.5 seconds interval in between (4 x
12 x 4.5 sec = 3 min and 36 seconds in total). Then, the
participants either had three minutes to think about the
attributes (deliberation condition), or had to come up within
three minutes with as many answers as possible to the
question “What could you do if you were invisible?”
(distraction condition). Finally, participants were asked to
order the universities from best to worst choice.

Statistical Analysis
The chosen order of the universities is recorded for
rationality of choice. Hence, the percentage of participants
choosing the best option as the first (and the worst as the
last) can be reported. χ2-tests and binominal tests are
performed to assess group differences and chance level
(two-tailed). Furthermore, the steps necessary to get from
the participants choice to the optimal choice (A-B-C-D; e.g.
6 steps for D-C-B-A and 3 steps for C-B-A-D, respectively)
as well as the number of positive attributes for the first
choice can be calculated and represent measures of
rationality. T-tests as well as ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests
(Bonferroni correction) are performed.
Regarding weighting, the percentage of participants
choosing option B over option C is reported. This measure
is regardless of option B being the first, second or third
choice, as long as it comes before C. χ2-tests are performed
to assess group differences.

Results
UTT Effect
Best Option as First Choice
The percentage of participants choosing the best option as
the first (A=1st Choice) is 50.8% for CT and 70.5% for UT.
This difference is significant for the whole sample (χ2[1,
120] = 4.858, p = .028) and stronger with participants with
impairment excluded (χ2[1, 110] = 6.571, p = .010).
Number of Positive Attributes of the First Choice
The first choice made by participants in the UT group had
on average more positive attributes than in the CT group
(M=6.78, SD=1.390 and M=7.34, SD=1.078, respectively;
p=.015).
Choice order
Participants needed on average M=1.38 (SD=1.445) moves
to get to the optimal order A-B-C-D. In total, one third
(30.0%) of the participants found the rational order of A-BC-D, another third (35.8%) needed one move to get to this

2418

order, the remaining needed two or more moves. Of those
needing one move, the order B-A-C-D was the most
common (41.9%), followed by A-B-D-C (37.2%).
Participants in the CT group were on average more moves
away from the rational order of universities than participants
in the UT group (M=1.63, SD=1.553 and M=1.15,
SD=1.302); this difference is significant when participants
with impairments are excluded (t[94] = 2.241, p = .027;
M=1.60, SD=1.594 and M=1.02, SD=1.080, respectively).
Choice according to subjective utility
In the CT condition, participants chose according to their
own weighting preferences (78.0% chose B over C) not
differently than in the UT condition (77.0% chose B over C;
χ2[1, 120] = 0.014, p =.904). There are no significant
differences between those participants who made the best
choice (A=1st Choice; CT: 73.3%, UT: 79.1%) and those
who made an inferior choice (χ2[1,120] = 0.066, p = .797).
Chance level
All four measures in both groups were significantly
different from the chance levels (all binomial and t-tests p <
.01).

chance level. Here, however, both conditions are above
chance level and significant on more than one measure.

Individual Differences
Of all individual differences (age, first language,
student/employment, course [if applicable], ethnicity,
handedness), only gender showed an effect and is discussed
in the following.
Gender
There was a tendency for male participants to decide more
rationally (71.4% vs. 55.1%). This is, however, not
significant (χ2[1]=3.044, p=.081). In detail it can be seen,
that (1) female participants did better in the UT than in the
CT condition regarding A=1st choice (70.0% vs. 39.5%,
χ2[1,120] = 7.341, p = .007), number of positive attributes
(M = 7.30, SD = 1.159 vs. M = 6.53, SD = 1.370, t[76] =
2.685, p = .009) and necessary moves (M = 1.05, SD =
1.037 vs. M = 1.74, SD = 1.622, p = .03), but not regarding
B before C; (2) Male participants did equally well in both
thought conditions (both 71.4%). Thus, the UTT effect is
solely driven by female participants. In the UT condition,
men were at chance in choosing B over C, but required
fewer moves to get to the correct order.

Discussion
This study replicated the UT effect in a large sample where
each participant weighted attributes individually, ensuring
options were the best or worst according to both objective
and subjective standards. Gender had an effect on the
rationality of decision-making.

UT effect
In this study, a significant UT advantage was found on all
three measurements used (but there was no difference in
choice according to subjective utility). This result is
remarkable insofar as Nieuwenstein and van Rijn (2012) in
their meta-analysis only found an effect when CT was at

2419

“ns” indicates that the group is not different from the
horizontal chance level.

Also, attributes match the subjective preferences, which
undermines previous critiques that results were distorted by
differences in individual and objective choice.
One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that long
deliberation time might enhance interference in the CT
group and that Nieuwenstein and van Rijn (2012) did not
find an effect because of their short deliberation time.

Weighting
Thought (77.0% vs. 78%) had no effect on choice according
to subjective utility. However, a pattern in the number of
necessary moves can be found linked to subjective utility:
participants who needed only one move (a third), most often
switched between A and B (B-A-C-D, 41.9%) and C and D
(A-B-D-C, 37.2%). This indicates that it was harder to
distinguish between A and B, and between C and D,
respectively, than between B and C where the only
difference was the subjective preference. Although research
shows that consistency and variability of preference change
when participants think about their attitudes (Levine,
Halberstadt, Goldstone, 1996; Wilson, Dunn, Kraft, Lisle,
1989), taking subjective weighting into account reduces the
risk of a distorted choice.

Gender
In this study, the basic UT effect can be attributed to the
effect of gender, i.e. male participants did not show a
difference between conscious and unconscious thought
(both 71.4%), whereas female participants responded
strongly to the thought manipulation (CT: 39.5%, UT:
70.0%), with CT not different from chance level. This is in
stark contrast to previous findings (Dijksterhuis, 2004;
Thornsteinson & Withrow, 2009, Nieuwenstein & van Rijn,
2012), where male participants showed more variable
results and females performed consistently well.
Women in the CT group also chose an option with fewer
positive attributes than women in the UT group. It appears
that women in the CT group underperformed, while there
were no differences amongst the other groups. One possible
explanation is that women’s performance was impaired by a
phenomenon called stereotype threat. Stereotype threat
states that if for a specific group a negative stereotype exists
and is triggered, it leads to underperformance of this group
due to anxiety that one might confirm the stereotype (Steele,
1997). It has been observed for women and the negative
stereotype that they are less gifted in mathematics (Spencer,
Steele, & Quinn, 1999). Here, stereotype threat might have
been triggered by asking for a rational choice (study
advertising and instructions) with the background of women
being seen as ‘irrational’ deciders, i.e. as following intuition
at the cost of rationality. Stereotype threat was long believed
to impair working memory. Recent research, however,
suggests that mere effort accounts for the difference in
performance, i.e. the participant under threat tries harder and
thus relies on effortful mental processes rather than learning
alternative, more efficient strategies (Jamieson & Harkins,

2007; Rydell, Shiffrin, Coucher, Van Loo, & Rydell, 2010).
Making a decision based on all 48 attributes presented is a
keen but virtually impossible task and hence heuristics are a
more efficient alternative (Gigerenzer, 2004) that women in
the CT group were presumably not willing to take due to
stereotype threat. For further research it is suggested that the
focus turn to the exact strategies participants use to come to
a decision and how these interact with individual
differences.
Although women in the CT seem to underperform, men in
the UT group were insensitive to the subjective weighting,
suggesting that gender and distraction influence the type of
decision-making strategy.

Strengths and Limitations
One limitation of this study is that assessing subjective
preferences before the task, despite the distractor tasks,
might have changed the mind-set of participants. As
discussed above, alternatives are possible and should be
considered for further investigation. Under the present
circumstances, however, this approach addressed the
importance of subjective weighting with the least
interference.
The strength of this study is a replication of the main
effect with a bigger sample using several measures. Also,
construction of the four options according to individual
weighting should have lead to less biased results. Based on
the findings here, further research should focus on (1)
whether the UT effect shows under certain circumstances,
(2) what the mental steps are on which the choices are
based, e.g. which heuristics are used during encoding, and
(3) how decision making interacts with individual
differences.
