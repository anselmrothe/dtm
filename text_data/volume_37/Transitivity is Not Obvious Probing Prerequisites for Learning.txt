Transitivity and Fractions Concepts
The decision to investigate transitivity arose from the                                 Transitivity Experiment
qualitative findings of a small-scale, exploratory pilot study         This transitivity experiment was part of the delayed post-test

The transitivity experiment consisted of a pre-question, the
solution to the pre-question, and then a post-question. In the
pre-question, students were shown a solved fraction addition
problem, including the sum, and were asked to enter the
sum of the original addends (pre-question, Figure 1). After
answering, students were shown a re-statement of the
problem (Figure 2), and then pressed a button to see the
answer, along with the instruction for their condition
(Figure 4). The students were randomly assigned to one of
four instructional conditions: (1) a conceptual text rule; (2)
an example of procedural steps; (3) both; and (4) no
instruction. The conceptual rule said “if you have three
things and the first two are equal and the last two are equal,
then all three are equal, so the first and the last are equal”.
The example of procedural steps first highlighted that the          Figure 1: Pre-question, assessing if students realize the

hand side of the second equation, then placed all three             problem expression.
expressions on one line, with equal signs between them.
   After seeing the solution to the pre-question (with
accompanying explanation depending on the condition),
students were given an isomorphic post-question. Both the
pre- and post-questions used addends with denominators
whose least common multiple (LCM) was smaller than their
product, and the converted and sum fractions used the LCM
as the denominator. These types of denominators help
distinguish between students who are solving the problem
from scratch (likely to use the product as the denominator)
and students who are using transitivity to identify the sum.
   The brief instruction is intended to clarify the assessment
results, and not to provide in-depth teaching on the concept
of transitivity. Problem statements usually do not explicitly
include their solutions, and the instruction should reassure        Figure 2: The first screen of the instruction. For the worked

Poor performance on both the pre- and the post-item would
suggest that students do not understand transitivity, at least
in the context of fraction addition.
   The delayed post-test also included 6 fraction addition
items with unlike denominators, where neither denominator
was a multiple of the other (Figure 3). Differences in

would indicate that students are not solving the transitivity
