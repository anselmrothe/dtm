   Data for interval judgments were classified into three
categories: trials where an embedded event occurred before
the interval, during interval, or not at all. Data for embedded
event judgments were classified into two categories: trials
where the embedded event occurred before the interval and
trials where it occurred during the interval. Note that this
classification is based on actual rather than scheduled
embedded event location. Table 1 shows that the prediction
algorithm achieved approximately equal distribution of
embedded events before and during intervals. There are no
