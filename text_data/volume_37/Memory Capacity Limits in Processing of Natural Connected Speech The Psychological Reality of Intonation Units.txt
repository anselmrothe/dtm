to have a significant positive effect on recall performance
when there are a small number of IUs in the stimulus, but
to have no significant effect for stimuli with more than
3-6 IUs. This result fits well with accounts of short-term
memory capacity that assume a limit in terms of a small
number of chunks, such as the 3-5 item limit in Cowan
(2000).
   Clauses do not appear to play a significant role in re-
call of naturally-produced spoken language, with no sig-
nificant effect found for number of clauses in the stim-
ulus. Previous findings of significant effects of clause
boundaries on recall (e.g. Marslen-Wilson & Tyler, 1976;
Jarvalla, 1979) may be a side-effect of the overlap be-
tween clause and IU boundaries in written-style lan-
guage.
