                                                                     compared infants’ attention during the first three habituation

                                                                     t(39) = 6.52, p < .001. There were no differences between

on which they habituated (silent: M = 10.55, speech: M =
8.80, p = .27). Second, to assess whether infants
dishabituated at test (when the new images of dogs were
introduced), we compared infants’ mean looking during the
final three habituation trials to their mean looking during
test trials. Indeed, infants did dishabituate overall (M
difference = 2.93s, p = .033).
    This outcome, which provides assurances that infants at
least noticed the new images presented at test, permitted us
to address our primary questions: At test, did infants
distinguish between the familiar and novel rules? And did
their ability to do so differ between the Speech and Silent
conditions? To address these questions, we entered infants’
looking times at test into a 2 (Condition: Speech, Silent) x 2
(Trial Type: Novel, Familiar) ANOVA. We found a reliable

familiar test trials (M = 10.56s, SD = 9.29) than novel test
trials (M = 7.80s, SD = 4.20), t(39) = -2.57, p = .014, d = -
.41. A non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test
corroborated the direction and significance of this
preference, p = .029, as did infants’ dishabituation patterns
at Test: Infants reliably dishabituated to familiar rule trials
(M = 4.30s, p = .016) but not to novel rule (M = 1.55s, p
= .16) trials.
    These results indicate that infants in both conditions
learned the abstract rule during Habituation and, critically,
generalized this rule to the novel stimuli at Test. Because
there was no interaction between Trial Type and Condition,
infants’ learning did not differ between Speech and Silent
conditions.
    Two features of infants’ performance warrant further
comment. First, notice that in both conditions, infants
preferred the test trials depicting the familiar rule to those
depicting the novel rule. This suggests that detecting the
rule in these visual stimuli was cognitively demanding and
thus required further attention and processing (Colombo &
Bundy, 1983; Roder, Bushnell, & Sasseville, 2000). Given                Figure 3: Infants’ preference for novel trials (difference

reported familiarity preferences (e.g., Gerken et al., 2014;
Thiessen, 2012), it is perhaps unsurprising that these 3- and
4-month-olds revealed their learning in the same manner.
    Second, it is clear from Figure 3 that the magnitude of          accounts of familiarity and novelty preferences (e.g.,
