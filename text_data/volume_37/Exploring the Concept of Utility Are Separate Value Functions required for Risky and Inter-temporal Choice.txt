In this model the same value function (Equation 2) and
choice functions (Equation 3) were used for the risky and
inter-temporal choices. Therefore a single a and single Œµ
parameter were estimated for each participant.
Separate Model
In this model risky and inter-temporal choices were fit
completely separately. Different value functions were used
for risky choice and inter-temporal choice, resulting in two
value parameters, ar for risky choice and ai for inter-
temporal choice. Similarly there were two choice scaling
parameters Œµr and Œµi as separate choice functions were also
used. Unlike the common model this means behavior in the
inter-temporal choices had no influence on parameter
estimation for risky choice, and vice versa.
   The fits of the two models were compared using Bayesian
Information Criteria (BIC) which takes into account both
the fit of the model, as a log likelihood, and the complexity
of the model, in its number of parameters. The common
model had four parameters, a, h, r, Œµ, while the separate
model had six, ar, ai, h, r, Œµr, Œµi.
   Using BIC to compare fits is a winner takes all approach,     Figure 1: Log Likelihood for the fit of each model for each

Separate models provide equivalent fits to the data, the
simpler model is preferred. For those where the Separate
model fit better, marked in black, the triangles tend to be
much lower than the squares. This suggests that the extra
complexity of the Separate model is warranted by the data.
Finally, since grey and black points are interspersed across
the range of log likelihoods, it appears that the simple model
is not only preferred when neither can account for the data
well.
BIC Weights
Figure 2 shows the model probabilities, as calculated from
BIC weights, for each participant in each of the three
experiments. Most participants cluster at either end of the
scale, suggesting that one model was generally fitting much
better than the other. This means that our weighted BIC
results are very similar to the winner takes all BIC
comparison, and again suggest that many participants do not
benefit from allowing separate value functions. In all three
experiments the mean wBIC was close to 0.5, with values of
0.47, 0.51, and 0.58 respectively.
