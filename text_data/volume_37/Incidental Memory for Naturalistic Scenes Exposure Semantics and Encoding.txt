dynamics framework that tracks the semi-continuous move-
ment of the arm during reaching decisions (Spivey & Dale,
2006). In such a framework, participants are typically pre-
sented with two alternative choices at the top of a computer
screen, and response trajectories are monitored en-route to
the response. Analysis of these micro-behaviors have been
shown to correlate with underlying cognitive mechanisms in
a variety of domains spanning deception (Duran, Dale, & Mc-
Namara, 2010) to memory (Papesh & Goldinger, 2012).
   Participants completed two consecutive tasks: a verifica-

task, i.e., participants were not informed that their memory
would be tested. To preview the experiment procedure de-
