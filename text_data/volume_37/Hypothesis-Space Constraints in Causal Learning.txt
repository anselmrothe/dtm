      Experiment 1: Distributional Properties
As long as objects in two (or more) sets can be grouped
into types, the relative proportions of those types across sets                          (a)                            (b)

serve to establish object identity, making such operations
widely applicable. Even young infants have been shown to
understand proportion, as they map proportion to probability
of outcomes and can use proportion to guide their actions
(Xu & Garcia, 2008; Xu & Denison, 2009; Denison & Xu,

causal processes preserve proportion and if they can use this

described as identical except that they differed in their ‘spe-
cial lights’. The experimenter said, “The lights in the first
room start out looking like this. . . then after a while they look
like this. . . then after a while they look like this. . . ”, placing
a light on the table each time he said ‘this’. The lights were
placed one by one on the table, left-to-right facing the child.
Once the eight lights from the first set were placed, the ex-
perimenter said, “In the other room, the lights start out look-
ing like this. . . then after a while they look like this. . . ” and
placed the lights for that room in the same manner as for the
first. For one of the rooms the experimenter used the red and
yellow (periodic) lights in alternation; for the other the exper-
imenter used the continuously-varying red-to-yellow (mono-
tonic) lights. Room type (periodic or monotonic) was ran-
domized, as was whether the first light in each room was red
or yellow. The language used to describe both sets of lights
was identical. The first four lights in each set were placed on
the table approximately every 3 seconds; to keep the descrip-
tion conversational, each of the last four lights was placed
approximately every 1 second. This also ensured that there
was no way to map the rate of presentation of the cards to the            Figure 4: Periodic (green) and monotonic (purple) bugs from
