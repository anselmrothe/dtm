Abstract
Measuring response times has been a staple for evaluating
masked semantic priming. Its efficacy, however, has been
challenged on several grounds — reported effect sizes of
these studies are relatively small, and priming effects
pertaining to response time measures are difficult to be
replicated. Here, we report a complementary method —
recording trajectories of a computer cursor. Participants
judged whether two digits were the same or different,
preceded by a briefly presented masked prime. Each prime
had either positive or negative connotations, and the priming
effects were evaluated either by response times or cursor
trajectories associated with the area under the curve. Results
indicate that the effect size of the congruency effect measured
by cursor trajectories (i.e. area under the curve) was far
greater than that measured by response times, suggesting that
the cursor trajectory measure is more sensitive to masked
semantic priming than the response time measure.

Introduction
Masked semantic priming has played a pivotal role in
deepening our understanding of conscious and unconscious
processing. In a typical masked semantic priming study,
participants judge whether two numbers are the same or
different (e.g., “3 / 3” or “3 / 5”), preceded by two masked
priming letters (e.g., “A / a” or “A / g”). Trials where primes
and targets semantically conflict are called incongruent
trials (e.g., “A / g” prime and “3 / 3” target), otherwise they
are congruent trials (e.g., “A / a” prime and “3 / 3” target). It
is found that response times in incongruent trials are longer
than those in congruent trials, which is called “congruency
effect” (Van Opstal, Gevers, Osman, & Verguts, 2010).
Congruency effects can occur at a semantic level in near
absence of awareness. For example, masked letters, words
or pictures can be categorized subliminally (Dehaene et al.,
1998, Dell'Acqua & Grainger, 1999; Weibel, Giersch,
Dehaene, & Huron, 2013). In addition, complicated
judgments can be unconsciously applied to masked stimuli
(Kiesel, Kund, Pohl, Berner, & Hoffmann, 2009). A further
study suggests that semantic context information can be
processed without much awareness (Van Opstal, Calderon,
Gevers, & Verguts, 2011).
However, the credibility of masked semantic priming has
been questioned on several grounds. First, effect sizes
reported in these studies are relatively small; a meta-

analysis study summarizing masked semantic priming
effects suggests that those priming effects are often difficult
to be replicated (Van den Bussche, Van den Noortgate, &
Reynvoet, 2009). Second, it is argued that congruency
effects could be underestimated due to participants’
conscious control of response times, known as the Gratton
Effect (Gratton, Coles, & Donchin, 1992). Specifically,
when a trial is incongruent, participants respond faster to a
subsequent incongruent trial, resulting in reduced
congruency effects (Desender & Bussche, 2012). Kinoshita,
Forster, and Mozer (2008) showed that participants became
aware of the incongruent trials, and adjusted their response
times to mitigate the response delay. These effects originate
from participants’ self-control, also known as “trial-by-trial”
modulation (Egner, 2007). Such modulation reduces
response times for incongruent trials and produces smaller
congruency effects.
One important factor that contributes to these
shortcomings is the way that semantic priming is assessed.
Most behavioral data collected to evaluate masked semantic
priming is based on response times, which provides only
one data point for each trial. Response times are not very
informative with regard to the dynamic cognitive processes
that unfold within a short period, which is yet fundamental
for the occurrence of subliminal priming. To probe those
dynamic processes, a measurement procedure sensitive to
fine-tuned data points that correspond to decision-making
processes is needed. In addition, the Gratton Effect is
attributed to participants’ adaptation to semantic conflicts
experienced in incongruent trials; such adaptation leads
participants to build up a stable response time pattern during
experiments. Thus, to alleviate the interference of the
Gratton Effect, a measurement procedure that is sensitive to
dynamic decision processes should be developed.
Here we introduce a complementary tool to measure
semantic priming—assessing trajectories of a computer
cursor (Dale, Kehoe, & Spivey, 2007; Song & Nakayama,
2009; Spivey & Dale, 2006; Xiao & Yamauchi, 2014;
Yamauchi, 2013; Yamauchi, Kohn, & Yu, 2007). The merit
of the cursor motion method is that it records dynamic
temporal-spatial information about participants’ responses,
in addition to response time data (Freeman & Ambady,
2010). For each trial, participants use a computer mouse to
respond, while running times and positions of the cursor on
the screen are recorded every 20ms to generate a cursor
motion trajectory. By analyzing the temporal-spatial

2691

features of cursor motion trajectories, further insights can be
gained to understand semantic priming.
There are a few studies that have applied the cursor
motion method to study priming. For example, Friedman
and Finkbeiner (2010) find that repetition priming and
semantic priming can be distinguished by different cursor
trajectory patterns. Furthermore, Xiao and Yamauchi (2014)
show that congruency effects can be reliably measured by
attractions toward unintended choices of cursor trajectories,
and incongruent trials elicit larger attractions than congruent
trials do. Though cursor motion methods seem powerful, no
studies have compared the cursor motion measures directly
to response time measures in a masked priming framework.
To compare the two measures, two independent
experiments respectively applying the cursor motion
measure and response time measure are conducted in the
current study. A different group of participants were
recruited for each experiment, and the methodology was
developed by Xiao and Yamauchi (2014).

Method

Participants
In total, 64 undergraduates from Texas A&M University
participated in our experiments for course credits. Among
them, 28 participants were assigned to a cursor motion
experiment, while 36 to a response time experiment.

Materials
Prime stimuli were three pairs of symbolic pictures. Each
pair consisted of one picture with positive connotations and
the other with negative connotations (Table 1). Four number
pairs were used as target stimuli; two of the pairs demand
“same” responses (i.e., “3 \ 3” or “5 \ 5”), and the other two
pairs demand “different” responses (i.e., “3 \ 5” or “5 \ 3”).

Both experiments consisted of two phases: a number
judgment task followed by an awareness test. In the number
judgment task, participants judged whether two numbers
were the same or different, preceded by a briefly presented
picture. The trials in the awareness test were identical to
those in the number judgment task except that participants
were explicitly instructed to identify the primes and choose
the correct prime from two options. With this design, we
know whether primes are visible to participants.
With the number judgment task, we investigate whether
the semantic gist of masked pictures (i.e. primes) can
influence participants’ “same / different” judgment of
numbers. A psychophysics study showed that the “same” or
“different” judgments of stimuli are respectively mapped to
“yes” or “no” responses (Schoups, Vogels, & Orban, 1995).
It is also well known that positive (e.g. “yes”) responses
elicit shorter response times than negative (e.g. “no”)
responses (Sternberg, 1966). A similar trend was found for
“same / different” judgment: “same” responses took shorter
response times than “different” responses (Ratcliff, 1985).
Based on Proctor’s Unified Theory (1981), such response
time differences indicate that “same” and positive
judgments employ an analogous processing mechanism, as
distinct from processes underlying “different” or negative
judgments. Following this rationale, we assume that priming
pictures with positive connotations (e.g., a smiley face) are
congruent with “same” responses (e.g., “3 \ 3”) while
primes with negative connotations (e.g., an upset face) are
congruent with “different” responses (e.g., “3 \ 5”). Thus,
we predict that positive primes facilitate “same” while
impede “different” response; in contrast, negative primes
facilitate “different” while impede “same” responses (Xiao
& Yamauchi, 2014).

Measuring Cursor Motion
For the cursor motion experiment, the area under the curve
(AUC) of a cursor trajectory in each trial is calculated as the
geometric area circumscribed by a straight line from the
onset position to an ending position, and by the actual
trajectory that exceeds the straight line toward the
unintended option (Figure 2). The AUC is measured by the
number of pixels. A smaller AUC indicates that the trial is
easier to respond to, while a larger AUC indicates more
semantic conflicts experienced between the prime and target
(Freeman et al., 2008). The position of the cursor is
recorded as one data point every 20ms (Figure 3), and all
data points are normalized into 100 steps for each trial using
a linear interpolation method.

incongruent trial and a congruent trial. The first figure
shows a trajectory with a large attraction (AUC) towards the
unintended button, while the second figure shows a
trajectory with a small AUC.

Procedure

Figure 2: Illustration of the area under the curve (AUC).
In this example, participants judge whether the digits 3 and
5 are the same or different. The curve represents a
hypothetical trajectory of a cursor moving from the center of
the “START” button to the ending position (where the
“Different” button is clicked). The dashed straight line
represents the shorted path from the onset to ending position.
The AUC is defined by the area circumscribed by the
shortest path, and by the actual trajectory curve exceeding
the shortest path toward the unintended button.

In each trial, a fixation cross was presented at the center
of the screen for 300ms. Then, a pre-mask was presented for
100ms, followed by a priming picture presented for 20ms,
and a post-mask for 100ms. Finally, the target was
presented until participants responded. Participants were
instructed to judge whether the two numbers were the same
or different, while ignoring any pictures flashed prior to the
numbers. There were 240 trials for each participant: 120
trials were congruent (60 PP and 60 NN trials) and 120
trials were incongruent (60 NP and 60 PN trials). These
trials were further divided into two categories with either the
“same” (“3 \ 3” or “5 \ 5” targets) or “different” (“3 \ 5” or
“5 \ 3” targets) response trials (See Table 1).

For the cursor motion experiment, participants were
instructed to use the mouse to click the “Same” or
“Different” button on the top of the screen quickly and
accurately (Figure 4a). Whether “Same” button was on the
left or right was counterbalanced between participants. For
the response time experiment, participants were instructed
to press the “F” button on a keyboard to choose “Same” and
the “J” button to choose “Different” (Figure 5a).
After the number judgment task, participants took part in
an awareness test. There were 96 trials in the awareness test;
they were identical to those in the number judgment task.
However, participants were informed about the prime and
asked to identify it. For the cursor motion experiment,
participants clicked one of the two optional pictures that
matched the prime (Figure 4b). For the response time
experiment, participants pressed either “F” to choose the left
picture or “J” to choose the right picture (Figure 5b). The d’
measure obtained from the awareness test was calculated to
examine whether participants’ capacity to identify the
primes predicts their priming magnitudes. Specifically,
selecting the option that was presented as a prime was

2693

regarded as ‘hit’ and incorrectly selecting the same option
that was not actually presented was regarded as ‘false alarm’.

response time measure group, and the area under the curve
(AUC) for the cursor motion measure group. In the analysis,
we collapsed prime type and target type as one factor of
congruency (congruent, incongruent), and employed paired
t-tests to investigate the congruency effect (i.e. whether the
dependent variable for congruent trials is less than that for
incongruent trials). To compare congruency effects obtained
in the cursor trajectory measure and the response time
measure, we applied a meta-analytic method and evaluated
the relative magnitudes of the p values and effect sizes
obtained in the two experiments (Rosenthal, 1991).

Results
Trials with a response time longer than 3000ms were
dropped. Paired t-tests were performed to assess congruency
effects. For the cursor motion experiment, the AUC was
smaller for congruent trials (M = 3628.43, SD = 3875.79)
than for incongruent trials (M = 4746.17, SD = 4135.95),
t(27) = 5.13, p < 0.001, d = 1.97, 95% CId [1.31, 2.64]
(Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991; Fritz, Morris, & Richler,
2012). Similarly, for the response time experiment, the
response time (RT) was also shorter for congruent trials (M
= 733.32, SD = 156.28) than for incongruent trials (M =
759.50, SD = 168.60). However, this difference was only
marginally significant; t(35) = 1.92, p = 0.06, d = 0.65, 95%
CId [0.16, 1.14].
To further explore whether priming occurred at a
subliminal level, we calculated d’ for the awareness test to
measure the extent to which participants could identify the
masked primes (Greenwald, Draine, & Abrams, 1996). To
assess whether the priming effects depended on visibility of
primes, we performed a linear regression analysis on the d’
with the priming magnitude as the predicted variable, which
was calculated by subtracting the mean AUC of congruent
trials from that of incongruent trials for each subject
(Greenwald et al., 1996; Van Opstal, Gevers, Osman, &
Verguts, 2010).
For AUC data, there was no correlation between the
priming magnitude and d’ (Figure 6), b* = 0.29, t(26) = 1.55,
p = 0.14, suggesting that the congruency effect was not
influenced by prime visibility. Meanwhile, there was a
significant intercept at zero d’; b = 758.16, t(26) = 2.40, p =
0.02, indicating that the congruency effect was still
significant for participants who could hardly identify the
primes.

Figure 4: illustrations of the number judgment task and
awareness task in the cursor motion experiment. In the
number judgment task (a), participants judged whether two
digits were the same or different, preceded by a briefly
presented masked prime (e.g., a check). In the awareness
test, participants were asked to identify the priming picture
and click the correct picture of the two options.

Figure 5: The response time experiment. In the number
judgment task (a), participants pressed either “F” button to
choose “Same” or “J” to choose “Different”. In the
awareness test (b), participants pressed either “F” to choose
the left picture or “J” to choose the right.

Design
For both groups, the experiment is 2 (prime type: positive,
negative) × 2 (target type: same, different) within-subjects
design. The dependent variable is the response time for the

2694

To verify whether the AUC data revealed larger effect
size than the RT data, we compared the p values and effect
sizes with a meta-analytic method. For the p-value
comparison, Z is determined by a formula (Z1 — Z2)/√(2)
(Rosenthal, 1991). The p-value associated with a Z of 2.56
was 0.005 one-tailed; the difference between the p-values
was significant, and the AUC data revealed a smaller pvalue than the RT data. For comparison of effect sizes, Z is
determined by a formula (Zr1 — Zr2)/√(1/(N1-3)+1/(N2-3))
(Alexander, Scozzaro, & Borodkin, 1989; Snedecor &
Cochran, 1989). The p-value associated with a Z of 2.09
was 0.018 one-tailed; the difference between the effect sizes
was significant, and the AUCs revealed larger effect size
than the RTs.

Discussion

Figure 6: Regression on d’ with priming magnitude as the
predicted variable measured by AUCs. The X-axis is the d’
and the Y-axis is the priming magnitude, which was
calculated by subtracting the AUCs in congruent trials from
those in incongruent trials.
The same awareness analysis was performed for RT data.
A linear regression on the d’ with priming magnitude as the
predicted variable revealed no correlation between the
priming magnitude and d’ (Figure 7), b* = -0.057, t(34) = 0.33, p = 0.74; the congruency effect was not influenced by
prime visibility. And the intercept was not significant at
zero d’; b = 30.60, t(34) = 1.59, p = 0.12.

Figure 7: Regression on d’ with priming magnitude as the
predicted variable measured by RTs.

Both the response time measure and cursor motion measure
show congruency effects where congruent trials yield
shorter RTs, as well as smaller AUCs, than incongruent
trials. Consistent with the previous findings (Xiao &
Yamauchi, 2014), the gist of masked pictures can be
processed in near absence of awareness. In addition, the
priming effect size measured by AUCs is significantly
larger than that of RTs. Two reasons can account for this
difference.
First, response times record only the duration from the
onset of a target stimulus until a response is made, but no
information is recorded for what is happening during this
duration. Such information is indispensable, however, to
understand the subtle processes of semantic priming. In
contrast, a measure integrating temporal-spatial information
can reveal real-time features of behavioral data, therefore
has better accuracy than measures recording only temporal
information.
Second, response time data often suffers from the
influence of the Gratton Effect. Participants can more or less
estimate their response times and try to control it, which
usually results in reduced congruency effects due to
participants’ adaptation to semantic conflicts experienced in
incongruent trials. Cursor motion data is beneficial because
it includes spatial information in addition to temporal data.
Though temporal data alone may underestimate congruency
effects, semantic priming is still revealed by dynamic
temporal-spatial data. Admittedly, the current study is far
from a conclusion that the AUC data is less vulnerable to
the Gratton Effect than the RT data. Further studies are
needed to examine the robustness of cursor motion
measures against the Gratton Effect.
Though effect sizes are different between response times
and AUCs, both show analogous congruency effects,
meaning that the two measures are actually accessing the
same priming processes. Furthermore, since the effect size
measured by AUCs is far larger than that of RTs, though
RTs only show marginally significant results, the cursor
motion measure appears to be more sensitive to subtle
semantic priming. Thus we suggest that the cursor motion

2695

method can be a complementary tool for masked semantic
priming research.
