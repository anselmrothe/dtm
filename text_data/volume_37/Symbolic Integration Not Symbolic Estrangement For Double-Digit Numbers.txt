Arabic numerals and dot quantities mismatch. Moreover,
this effect should only occur when the text shows a numeral,
but not when the text shows a letter pair.
   If symbolic integration exists, then the symbolic numeral
shown on a stimulus could also influence participants’ per-
ceptions of the stimulus’ dot quantity. Thus, a second group
of participants was asked to estimate the number of dots
shown in the Numberness stimulus images. We predicted
that participants would show some bias in their dot quantity
perceptions when paired with Arabic numerals, but not with
letters. If participants showed a perceptual bias, then this
could change what participants perceive as a symbolic and
