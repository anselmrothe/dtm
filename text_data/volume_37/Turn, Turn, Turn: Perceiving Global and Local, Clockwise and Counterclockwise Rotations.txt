clockwise motion compared to counterclockwise motion. We
also found a highly significant interaction between the

“pure” clockwise rotation or “pure” counterclockwise
rotation, i.e., items in which both the Global figure and
associated local figures rotated in the same direction
(i.e., Cc or Xx items). We used only these items
because we wanted to compare how quickly the
presence or absence of a rotation type could be detected
when it was either completely present or completely
absent from the observed item. This choice was, in
addition, particularly important because there were so
many errors when the answer for a “mixed” item (i.e.,
Xc or Cx) was at the local level. For this reason no
“mixed” rotation items were considered in this analysis.
