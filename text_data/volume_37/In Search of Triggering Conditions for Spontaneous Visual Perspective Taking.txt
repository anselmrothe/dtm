Considering the important role VPT plays in action
coordination and social interaction (and the fact that it is
rarely verbally requested by the other interactant), future
research should more closely heed the distinction between
spontaneous and instructed perspective taking processes.
  Although VPT can be induced spontaneously, Study 1c                    Gaze-D,              Gaze-D,                Gaze-D,

VPT task is explicit and straightforward. In this light, the
high spontaneous VPT rates in the gaze and reaching

   The conclusion on the triggering effect of gaze contains
more nuances. Study 2a found that people had similar VPT
rates and TRTs regardless of the object the actor looked at,
suggesting that gaze activated spontaneous VPT globally.
Study 2b also found no differential effect of gaze direction
on TRTs, yet there was a main effect of gaze direction.

Methods
Stimuli. We created a scenario resembling that in previous
studies, but instead of two objects on the table, the actor
faced four numbers – 86, 87, 88, and 89 – with equal
distance between them and the number “87” covered under
a piece of white paper (Figure 5). Critically, the visible
numbers were horizontally symmetric and therefore did not                   Figure 6. Spontaneous VPT rates in Study 3.
