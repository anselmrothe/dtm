Replication of Previous Studies.
As predicted, when given an Outcome-based mindset, the
recall of an unethical act led to Moral Balancing and an
increased intention to perform the moral action (Figure 1).
When given a Rule-based mindset, the reverse pattern was
observed. This result was confirmed in the ANOVA, which
showed a significant interaction between Type of Mind-set
and Type of Ethical Recall, F(1,44) = 7.12, p < 0.01, but no
