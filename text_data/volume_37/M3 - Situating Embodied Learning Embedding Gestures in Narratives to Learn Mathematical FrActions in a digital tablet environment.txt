The tutor-game consists of 5 levels with 5 fractions each. In
Part 1, players use gestures to estimate, denominate and
numerate fractions by manipulating an enerchi bar (Fig. 2,
left), a hybrid of a rectangular area model and a number line
(Siegler et al., 2010). In Part 2, players determine
equivalence between the fractions by ordering them from
least to greatest along a horizontal axis, left to right, then
verifying their height vertically from bottom to top (Fig. 2).       Figure 3. Conceptual Gestures and Deictic Gestures.
