assembly line, or inventing new categories for novel objects.
  The ubiquity of similarity judgments raises the question
of whether they may derive from general, task-independent
cognitive processes. If so, the specific nature of those
processes and which similarity judgment behaviors they
map to will be critical in better understanding the many
tasks involving similarity judgments. One way to determine
the nature of any core similarity processes is to test for task
