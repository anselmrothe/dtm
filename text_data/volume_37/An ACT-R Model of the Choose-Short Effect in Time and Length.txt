blending process has been used to model various kinds of
magnitude judgments in both temporal (Moon & Anderson,
2013; Taatgen & Van Rijn, 2011) and non-temporal
(Peebles & Jones, 2014) dimensions. Instead of retrieving a
specific chunk, blending produces a weighted aggregation
of all candidate chunks available in memory. Each candidate
chunk is given a different weight based on how recently the
chunk has been created and how closely it matches the
current retrieval request.
   Several models of magnitude estimation assume that a
stimulus is represented with a category label selected on the
basis of its similarity to the category prototype (Petrov &
Anderson, 2005; Ward, 1979). Building on this notion, we                    Figure 3: An example of blending in time discrimination.
