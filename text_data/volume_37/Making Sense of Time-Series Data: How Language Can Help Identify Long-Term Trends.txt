such as spatial transformations.
   If this is the case, language might be a useful tool to
support spatial cognition. Evidence suggests that attending
to spatial language when encoding visual scenes can help
construct representations that support spatial reasoning
(Loewenstein & Gentner, 2005) and can influence memory
of spatial scenes (Feist & Gentner, 2007). Furthermore,
language can provide a user-goal during the study of a
visual scene (i.e. a purpose for engaging with the scene),
which may then activate relevant schema and guide visual-
spatial attention (Brunyé & Taylor, 2009; Rothkopf,
