Abstract
Three experiments explore differences between blocked and
interleaved study with and without item repetition. In the first
experiment we find that when items are repeated during
study, blocked study results in higher test performance than
interleaved study. In the second experiment we find that when
there is no item repetition, interleaved and blocked study
result in equivalent performance during the test phase. In the
third experiment we find that when the study is passive and
includes no item repetition, interleaved study results in higher
test performance. We propose that learners create associations
between items of the same category during blocked study and
item repetition strengthens these associations. Interleaved
study leads to weaker associations between items of the same
category and therefore results in worse performance during
test when there are item repetitions.

Introduction
Flashcards are a popular study tool among students who
are preparing for an exam. Flashcards allow students to
study several different concepts together in a sequence.
Students are able to order the information however they like
and can repeat any information as needed. In flashcard
study, as in any learning situation that involves the
sequential presentation of different types of items, an
important pedagogical question is whether the different
concepts should be studied separately or intermixed.
This question has been studied before by contrasting
interleaved and blocked study. Interleaved study consists of
presenting examples of different categories or concepts in
close succession. For example, if one wanted to learn about
the styles of Monet, Degas, and Renoir through an
interleaved presentation, one might study a painting by
Monet, a painting by Degas, a painting by Renoir, a painting
by Monet, a painting by Degas, a painting by Renoir and so
on. Blocked study, on the other hand, consists of presenting
examples of the same category or concept in close
succession before seeing a different category. To study the
same styles in a blocked study, one would see a sequence
such as: Monet, Monet, Degas, Degas, Renoir, and Renoir.
The sequence of materials during study is crucial to how
well the information is learned. Previous research suggests
that interleaving categories maximizes the contrast between
items from different categories and enhances discrimination
learning (Kornell & Bjork, 2008; Carvalho & Goldstone,

2014; Taylor & Rohrer, 2010). When information is studied
in a blocked sequence, on the contrary, contrast between
items of the same category is maximized, making
similarities among items belonging to the same category
more salient (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014). A similar
pattern is found in perceptual learning (Mitchell & Hall,
2014).
To account for this dichotomy, Carvalho and Goldstone
(2014) proposed the attentional bias theory. According to
this theory the dichotomy between when interleaved and
blocked study are beneficial is the result of the same
principle: the selective emphasis of categorization-relevant
features through comparison of sequentially presented
objects. Consistent with the proposals of the attentional bias
theory, the relative advantage of interleaved over blocked
study has been shown to be moderated by the type of
category being studied (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014,
whether study is active or passive (Carvalho & Goldstone,
2015), and the introduction of temporal spacing between
category repetitions (Birnbaum et al. 2014). These results
present important implications to how students should
organize their study. A general proposal is that study
sequence could be used to foster learning if effectively
selected.
An extension of the attentional bias theory could involve
the role of the creation of inter-item associations during
study. Because the learner’s attention to within-category
similarities is maximized during blocked study, this is likely
to contribute to a stronger encoding of the similarities and
the creation of associations between items that share these
common properties. For example, if one is studying three
categories in a blocked sequence one might see them as
follows: A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3. A2 would be
associated with A1 and A3 because of their temporal
proximity and shared commonalities. By contrast, in an
interleaved sequence, items of the same category are not
shown temporally close in a sequence and identifying
commonalities between them therefore establishing
associations between the items of the same category is less
likely to occur. Using the same examples as before, an
interleaved sequence might look like: A1, B1, C1, A2, B2,
C2, A3, B3, C3. Participants would be looking for
differences between items of different categories and items
of the same category are presented further apart in time.
After reviewing all of the material in a lesson once,
students often review the same information again. What is

1189

the effect of adding a second review of all of the materials
after studying the materials once? If what is encoded and the
associations established during the first review of the
materials differ between the interleaved and blocked
sequences, as we have proposed, then it is likely that a
second review would have a differential effect depending on
the study sequence.
If item repetition is added later into a blocked sequence
the learner might see, for example, A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3,
C1, C2, C3, A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3. When one
sees A1 for the second time, one is likely to retrieve A2 and
A3 as belonging to the same category as well, because A1,
A2, and A3 were strongly associated during the first
presentation. If item repetition is added later into an
interleaved sequence the learner might see A1, B1, C1, A2,
B2, C2, A3, B3, C3, A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3.
In this sequence, a new occurrence of A1 is less likely to
result in the recollection of A2 and A3 because they were
not strongly associated during the first presentation.
Another possibility is that, when A1 is repeated in a
blocked sequence the commonalities between all A items
(A1, A2, and A3 in this example) that were extracted and
encoded during the first study of these items will be
selectively, and more quickly, reemphasized. Interleaved
study, on the other hand, does not allow for the reactivation
of commonalities initially identified because learners are
unlikely to have noticed communalities between items of
the same category during initial study.
In effect, through a process of iterative recollection of
previous items (Hintzman, 2010; Ross, 1984; Ross, Perkins,
& Tenpenny, 1990), or rapid reactivation of common
properties when repetitions are presented, learners in a
blocked study sequence recollect more of the items in each
category during a second review, contributing to more
effective learning in that sequence of study.
In this paper we look at the influence of item repetition
on blocked and interleaved study across three experiments.
We predict that when item repetition is present, blocked
study will result in higher performance during the test phase
due to better encoding of the entire category.

to computer error (N=4) or not reaching performance above
chance level during either of the study phases (performance
below 17%; N=4).
Stimuli and Apparatus The stimuli were 120 paintings by
twelve artists (ten paintings by each artist). This set of
stimuli has been used in previous studies (e.g., Kornell &
Bjork 2008; see Figure 1).
To evaluate previous knowledge, we used a questionnaire
containing a list of 36 artists in three categories (famous
artists, artists featured in the experiment, and fake, but
plausible, artists). Stimuli presentation and participants’
responses were collected using E-Prime (Psychology
Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA).

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1 learners study the paintings from
different artists with six artist options below the painting
that they must select from (e.g. active study) and the study
sequence is repeated once. We predict that the existence of a
repetition of the study sequence will result in better
performance following blocked study than interleaved
study. As we mentioned in the introduction, we expect that
through a process of iterative recollection learners in the
blocked study use the repetition to recall more of the items
originally associated with the repeated painting.

Method
Participants Forty-eight undergraduate students at Indiana
University volunteered to participate for partial course
credit. Eight participants were excluded from analyses due

Figure 1: This is an example of 3 paintings from 4 artists that
appeared during the experiment. The artist name is listed above
each row.

Procedure Participants started by completing the
questionnaire. The participants were asked to circle any
artist name with which they were familiar. After completing
the questionnaire, participants continued to the experiment.
There were six phases to the experiment: Study1, Trivia1,
Test1, Study2, Trivia2, and Test2. During the study phases a
painting would appear on the screen with six artist names
(e.g., Bruno Pessani) listed below it. The image would
disappear after 1500 ms and participants were asked to click
on the artist name that they thought painted the image.
Feedback was given after every choice (whether it was
correct or incorrect). During the trivia phases, participants

1190

answered ten trivia questions. This distractor task lasted
approximately three minutes. During the test phases, a
painting would appear with the names of the six studied
artists below. The participants were instructed to click on
the name of the artist who they thought painted the image.
Feedback was not provided. Five paintings from each artist
were selected to be used during the study phase and five
paintings were selected to be used during the test phase.
Painting group/phase assignment was counterbalanced
across participants.
There were two study conditions. In the blocked study
condition participants saw a sequence of paintings such that
all paintings from one artist were shown before studying the
next artist (for a total of 30 trials). In the interleaved study
condition participants saw a sequence of paintings such that
no painting from the same artist was shown consecutively
(for a total of 30 trials). In both study conditions the
sequence was repeated once (for a total of 60 trials) and the
order of artists and paintings was fixed across participants.
During the test phase the order was fully randomized. Every
participant completed both study conditions. The order of
the study conditions and artist assignment were
counterbalanced across participants.

The verbatim repetition included in this experiment gives
learners a second chance to learn each painting with
temporal spacing between repetitions (Thios, 1972) and, as
we proposed in the introduction, might promote learning by
allowing the reactivation of all the items seen before or
quicker and more efficient selective activation of the
commonalities during study of a repeated item.

Error bars represent standard errors of the mean.

Results and Discussion
We started by analyzing the data from the questionnaire.
The questionnaire was scored in the following way: for
every artist included in the experiment correctly recognized,
2 points were added, for every fake artist selected, 1 point
was deducted, and for every famous artist selected, 1 point
was added, for a total of 24 points. Participants were
excluded from analyses if they reached the score of 20 or
higher. No participants reached this criterion (M=7.65, SD=
4.08).
Looking at performance during the study phase, we
expected that performance in the blocked condition would
be higher than in the interleaved condition because if
participants choose the strategy of selecting the same artist
as on the previous trial, they are more likely to be correct
than they would in the interleaved condition. The results
show that study performance in the blocked condition is
higher (M = 0.68, SD = 0.19) than in the interleaved
condition (M = 0.37, SD = 0.11), t (39) = 10.42, p < .0001.
Figure 2 shows the results from the test phase. Blocked
study results in higher performance during the test phase F
(1,39) = 10.98, p = .002, 𝜂G2 = .059. Moreover, overall
performance is higher for old items compared to novel
items, F (1,39) = 5.95, p = .02, 𝜂G2 = .003, but there is no
interaction between the two variables, F < 1.
Contrary to previous evidence from similar studies (e.g.,
Kornell & Bjork 2008; Kornell, Castel, Eich, & Bjork,
2010; Wahlheim, Dunlosky, & Jacoby, 2011), we found that
blocked, relative to interleaved, study results in higher
performance during test. The major differences between the
current study and past studies are that our study phase was
an active learning procedure and there was item repetition.

Interleaved

The active learning procedure requires a selection of a
response during study, in contrast to previous studies in
which the item was presented along with the correct
category assignment (passive study). As mentioned in the
introduction, it has been shown before that the type of study
(active vs. passive) affects whether interleaved or blocked
study is more advantageous for learning (Carvalho &
Goldstone, 2015) because it changes the constraints of the
learning task. However, previous studies have shown that
interleaved study benefited learning in an active study task
(Carvalho & Goldstone, 2015) contrary to what is seen here.
There are several possible reasons for this apparent
incongruence: On the one hand it is possible that the greater
number of categories and the different type of categories
used here might have changed the constraints of active
study. In fact, Carvalho and Goldstone (2015) proposed that
when using information integration categories (categories
for which it is not possible to devise a categorization rule
like the ones used in this experiment), the direction of the
effect might be reversed. On the other hand, it is possible
that the advantage of blocked study seen in this experiment
is solely the result of the existence of item repetition during
study.
In order to investigate the independent role of repetition,
Experiment 2 retains active study of categories but without
item repetition during study. In the absence of repetition,
there is no occasion for repetition-induced recall during the
second study round, as proposed. Therefore, we expect
interleaved study to result in better performance than

1191

Experiment 2
Method
Participants Forty-eight undergraduate students at Indiana
University volunteered to participate for partial course
credit. Seven participants were excluded from data analyses
because of prior knowledge of the artists used in the
experiment as measured by a questionnaire (N = 1) or not
reaching performance above chance level during either
study phase (performance below 17%; N = 6).
Stimuli and Apparatus The stimuli were the same as in
Experiment 1. The questionnaire was the same as in
Experiment 1, except two extra questions were added to
assess participants’ major and the number of fine art classes
taken. Stimuli were presented and participants’ responses
were collected using E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools,
Pittsburgh, PA) as in Experiment 1.
Procedure The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1,
except for the following changes. Participants studied six
paintings instead of five. During test, participants saw six
old items and four new. The assignment of the paintings to
study or test phase was randomized across subjects. The
artists’ names were presented by their last name only (e.g.,
Pessani). The buttons in both the study and the test phases
were changed from white to gray for saliency. There was
also no repetition of the category items during study.

Results and Discussion
Overall, participants scored low on the questionnaire
(M=8.31, SD= 4.41). Looking at performance during the
study phase, as in Experiment 1, performance in the blocked
condition (M = 0.58, SD = 0.19) was higher than in the
interleaved condition (M = 0.33, SD = 0.12), t (40) = 7.07, p
< .0001.
Of greater interest is performance during the test phase,
depicted in Figure 3. As can be seen from the figure there
was no difference in performance between the blocked and
interleaved study conditions F < 1. There is also no
difference in performance between categorizing new and old
items, F < 1, nor an interaction between stimulus novelty
and sequence, F < 1
The results from this experiment, although not definitive,
suggest a role of item repetition during study in the test
results of Experiment 1. That is, the main difference
between Experiments 1 and 2 was the item repetition, and
eliminating item repetition also eliminated the benefit for
blocked over interleaved training. However, part of the
advantage seen for blocked study in Experiment 1 might
also come from the use of an active study procedure that
includes repetition. One possibility is that in Experiment 2,
active study strengthens the associative links between items
and the correct category assignment that are created during
study. These strong associations result in an advantage for
blocked study, because it increases the likelihood that

learners are able to identify the style and correctly select the
artist name. These associative links provide an advantage
during test, but not as large of an advantage as it would be
when combined with the presence of item repetition (as in
Experiment 1). We will come back to this hypothesis in the
General Discussion.

To ascertain that an interleaved study advantage could be
found with our method, and that it is related to the use of a
passive study situation in the absence of repetition, we
conducted Experiment 3. In Experiment 3, learners study
the paintings from different artists with the correct artist
name displayed below them (passive study) and there is no
item repetition during study.

Experiment 3
Method
Participants Forty-three undergraduate students at Indiana
University volunteered to participate for partial course
credit. Data from all participants was included in the final
analyses.
Stimuli and Apparatus The stimuli were the same as in
Experiments 1 and 2. The questionnaire was the same as in
Experiment 2. Stimuli were presented and participants’
responses were collected using E-Prime (Psychology
Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) as in previous experiments.
Procedure The procedure is the same as in Experiment 2,
except for the following changes. Instead of the participant
having to choose from a list of six artists during study, the
paintings are now shown with the correct artist name
presented below it for three seconds. The procedure is
passive so the participants were not required to click any
buttons during study. There was no item repetition, similar
to Experiment 2.

Results and Discussion
We started by analyzing the data from the questionnaire.
The questionnaire was scored in the same way as the

1192

previous two experiments. Overall, participants scored low
on the questionnaire (M=7.85, SD=4.40) and no participants
reached the criterion of artist knowledge necessary to be
removed.

Experiments 1 and 2, interleaved study results in higher
performance during the test phase compared to blocked
study, F (1,42) = 15.85, p < .001, 𝜂G2 = .11.

Moreover, similar to what we see in Experiment 1,
performance is overall better for Old items compared to
New items, F (1,42) = 14.45, p < .0004, 𝜂G2 = .11, and there
is no interaction between the two variables, F < 1.
In sum, Experiment 3 replicates previous findings (Kang
& Pashler, 2012; Kornell & Bjork, 2008; Kornell, 2010)
showing that passive study with no repetition results in
interleaved study having higher performance during test.

General Discussion
In this paper we looked at the influence of item repetition
and study method (active vs. passive) on blocked and
interleaved study across three experiments. We predicted
that adding item repetition into an interleaved or blocked
study might have differential effects on learning. More
specifically, we predicted that adding item repetition into a
blocked study would produce higher performance during
test than interleaved study with item repetition.
We hypothesized that during blocked study, adding item
repetition would result in better encoding of the category
members due to the stronger associations between items of
the same category created during the first presentation of the
category. This, in turn, would result in learners recollecting
the specific item when repeated but also the other
temporally adjacent items from the same category during
the second presentation (repetition) of each item. On the
other hand, during interleaved study, adding item repetition
would result in worse retrieval of other category members
due to weaker associations between items of the same
category created during the first presentation of the

category. Items of the same category are presented farther
apart in time during interleaved study, therefore the learner
is less likely to identify communalities or create associations
between items of the same category in the first place. The
essence of this account is a putative reminding of samecategory items occurring in the same temporal context.
Consistent with this prediction we found that in a
situation in which there is item repetition, blocked study
results in higher performance during test (Experiment 1).
However, in a situation where there is no item repetition,
there is no difference between blocked and interleaved study
(Experiment 2).
A consideration of the role of temporally adjacent
comparison provides an alternative explanation for the
differential impact of item repetitions on interleaved and
blocked training. Consistent with arguments about the
cognitive importance of comparison for discovering critical
commonalities between members of the same category (e.g.,
Gentner et al., 2003; Markman & Gentner, 2006), it is
reasonable to posit that when two objects that belong in the
same category are presented successively, their
commonalities are highlighted. When an item is
subsequently repeated, the commonalities that this item
shares with other items from the same category will be
selectively re-emphasized because they were originally how
the blocked items were encoded. This account differs from
the aforementioned “reminding of associated items” account
because it posits that the within-category commonalities are
selectively emphasized. In this view the entire category
items, which possess features that are either idiosyncratic or
common to the category are encoded and recalled. One
result that is consistent with this “comparison-based
commonalities” account is that repetition improves
performance in the blocked study for both old and novel
items to the same extent. If participants were being
reminded of all the properties of items presented in the same
context as a repeated item during study, then one might
predict that these old, reminded items, would be particularly
well categorized during test. However, the fact that we
found equal benefits for old and new items at test is
consistent with the blocked advantage stemming from
encoding of the features that these two types of items share
– namely, the characteristic features shared by all category
members.
Adding item repetition also results in the inclusion of
temporal spacing between item repetitions unlike
interleaved and blocked study in which the only spacing is
between category repetitions (Kornell & Bjork, 2008;
Birnbaum et al., 2014; Kornell, 2009; Kornell et al., 2010;
Kang & Pashler, 2012). In fact, increased temporal spacing
between item repetitions has been shown to result in better
memory than temporal spacing between similar items (akin
to category repetitions; Thios, 1972). However, temporal
spacing between item repetitions does not differ between the
interleaved and blocked study in Experiment 1 and therefore
this factor cannot explain our current results.

1193

The results presented here also reiterate the role of the
study modality as a modulator of the relative advantage of
interleaved or blocked study (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2015).
Here we found that a blocked study advantage (Experiment
1) or equal performance between the two study sequences
(Experiment 2) is associated with active study situations
while interleaved study is more beneficial in a passive study
situation. The current studies use categories where there is
no simple description of a categorization rule (informationintegration categories, Ashby & Maddox, 2005) and
participants simultaneously learn a large number of
categories. These two factors might have critically
contributed to the benefits of interleaved sequences for
passive study and blocked sequences for active study. It is
possible that an active study situation promotes greater
association between the items and the label being presented,
which might be a particular difficulty when studying six
categories. Passive study, on the other hand, might promote
rule-based categorizations, even when informationintegration categories are used, similarly to what is seen
with unsupervised study (Ashby et al., 1999). The larger
opportunity to compare items from different categories
afforded by interleaved study would make finding a partial
categorization rule more likely. Moreover, the sequence
manipulation might result in different levels of passive
study. Because it is easy to predict the next category,
blocked active is more passive than interleaved active. The
same is true for the passive study conditions. This might
further influence the attentional patterns established during
study and contribute to the results seen here.
An important next step would be to look at the effects of
item repetition in a passive study condition to fully
understand how the type of study influences the creation of
item-item associations and its use during item repetition. It
would also be important to directly test the strength of interitem associations within and between the interleaved and
blocked schedules.
In educational settings, students and teachers alike
implement various strategies to try to facilitate learning.
One major kind of general and strategic flexibility that
individuals have in trying to maximize learning efficiency is
in determining how to sequence examples of different
categories. This research has shown that the common
strategy of reviewing the same materials a second time after
an initial pass might render blocked study more beneficial
than interleaved study.
