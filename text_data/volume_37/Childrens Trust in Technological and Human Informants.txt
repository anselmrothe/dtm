Although the vast majority of epistemic trust research
has involved comparisons between human sources,
recent work has shown that children apply some
principles of epistemic trust to non-human informants,
such as animated characters encountered in the media
(Danovitch & Mills, 2014) and computers with
differing rates of prior accuracy (Danovitch &
