Figure 2: Proportion of children’s first words falling into each CDI category. The datasets showed a high degree of consistency, with most first
words referring to animals or games and routines. These distributions were highly consistent between older and younger children, suggesting
that first words are driven by linguistic rather than conceptual factors. The dashed line shows the baseline distribution of CDI categories.
