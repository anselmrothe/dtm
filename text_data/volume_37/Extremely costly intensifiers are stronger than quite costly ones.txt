we would like to extend our results to additional adjectival
scales. However, most scales are not so easily quantifiable
as price; we require a different dependent measure in order
to probe them. For Experiment 2 we used a forced-ranking
dependent measure, which allows us to consider additional
adjectival scales. This dependent measure has the added ben-
efit of providing a more sensitive measure of the differences
in degrees between similar adjectival phrases.
