Abstract
In the present study, we test the theory that humans selectively
encode incoming sensory information on an as-necessary basis, when the information would not be accessible otherwise, in
order to compensate for cognitive limitations on the quantity of
new information that they can encode. We investigate whether
external informational sources—much like high-level knowledge obtained from previous experiences—can spare learners
from having to encode all new information in fine-grained detail. If this is true, we would expect to observe differences
between the way human learners encode new information that
they know to be easily available through external informational
resources (e.g., names of actors in a movie, the date of a historical event) and those that they know are not (e.g., names of
new acquaintances, the date of a wedding anniversary). Specifically, we would expect learners to encode far less detail for
information that is available through known external informational resources than for information that is not. We present
evidence from a study run on Amazon Mechanical Turk that
human memory preferentially encodes information that is not
expected to be available from external informational resources.

Potential Effects of External Memory Devices
on Human Cognition
External informational resources (e.g., books, pictures,
Wikipedia, notes) have the potential to act as external memory
devices for users by enabling them access to knowledge that
they need not have encoded and stored in their own memory
banks. Smart phones, one of the most common and widely
used personal information-providing devices to date, are a
prime example of technology that could act as an external
memory device for users. Smart phones give users quick access to both universal types of knowledge (e.g., answers to
common and uncommon questions about the world), as well
as more personal facts (e.g., names and phone numbers of
contacts, items on a personal grocery list). Previous research
has established that there are capacity limitations on how
much sensory information learners can encode into memory as they interact in the world (e.g., Alvarez & Franconeri,
2007; Huang, Treisman & Pashler, 2007; Lavie, 2005; Plude,
Enns & Brodeur, 1994; Saalmann, Pigarev & Vidyasagar,
2007). Thus, preferentially encoding into memory only information that is inaccessible through external means would
be advantageous because it would reserve the limited processing capacities in humans for material that cannot be obtained
elsewhere. In this study, we test whether human learners re-

serve their limited cognitive resources for information that is
not externally retrievable.
Previous work has established several cases in which learners are capable of employing sensible strategies in selecting
what information to encode into memory from all available
sensory input that they attend (e.g., Hemmer & Steyvers,
2009; Henkel, 2014; Sparrow, Liu & Wegner, 2011). For example, Henkel (2014) analyzed the effect that picture taking
has on memory. This study found that taking pictures substantially reduces one’s ability to recall scene details. Another
study conducted by Sparrow, Liu and Wegner (2011) looked
at whether the same phenomenon applied to written knowledge. In this study, Sparrow et al. tested whether individuals would remember information that they believed would
be inaccessible later by measuring differences in recall after
manipulating participants’ beliefs about the storage state of
information. Subjects were asked to type 40 facts into a computer program that they were either told would save or erase
the facts, depending upon the condition to which the subject
was assigned. After this typing task was complete, subjects
were then asked to type out as many of the facts as they could
remember. Those who believed that the computer had erased
the facts that they had previously typed into the program performed better on the recall task.
Our study aims to build on these previous findings by testing the hypothesis that individuals continually track what information they expect to be available in the future, even in the
absence of any overt cue, and that they preferentially allocate
memory resources to information that they expect to be unavailable through other means. This would test whether the
strategic processes studied by Henkel (2014) and Sparrow et
al. (2011) operate automatically and continuously in memory to track the likely future availability of information as it
is received. We predict that learners will employ an efficient
encoding strategy even in the absence of an explicit reference
source (e.g., a photo, notes), but also reference sources people
know to exist in the world (e.g., Wikipedia, IMDB). Although
researchers have speculated about this possibility (e.g., Sparrow et al., 2011), no one has previously published empirical
evidence in support of this hypothesis.
We hypothesized that individuals track what information
they expect to have access to later on (e.g., via the internet), and that information that they know is likely to be accessible through some external source will be deprioritized

for encoding into memory than information that they know
is unlikely to be available elsewhere. To test our hypothesis,
we conducted a computer-based behavioral study via Amazon Mechanical Turk that was designed to examine whether
people preferentially encode information that is not available through other external informational resources. We also
tested whether this effect was moderated by familiarity and
skill with looking up information online. We hypothesized
that if memory is in fact strategically allocated based on expectations about future access to information, people who are
more familiar and skilled with looking up information online
will show a greater preference for encoding the kind of facts
that cannot easily be looked up.

Methods
We tested subjects’ memory retention of facts from two
categories—those that could easily be looked up online, and
those that could not—using a within-subject design. If subjects strategically encode information with respect to their expectations about the future availability of that information, we
expect that they will more accurately remember the kinds of
facts that cannot be looked up online than those that can. Additionally, we measured subjects’ familiarity and skill with
looking up information online. We expect that, if an effect
of the availability of information online exists, it should be
moderated by how familiar and skilled subjects are at retrieving information online. This is because a subject must be able
to recognize what kinds of information are easily retrievable
online and what kinds are not in order to generate different
expectations for these two sets of fact types.

Subjects
One hundred and fifty subjects were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Subjects were required to be at least
18 years old and have IP addresses in the United States. We
paid each participant a rate equivalent to 10 dollars an hour
(the same rate as lab-based studies), with the opportunity to
receive additional compensation as a bonus for good task performance.

Task and Materials
The two-part experiment was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Subjects were instructed to complete the task alone
in a quiet environment, and to turn off any music or other devices in order to minimize distractions. Subjects had one hour
to complete the task. All subjects completed both parts of the
experiment described below in immediate succession.

Part 1: Web-savviness assessment Part 1 measured subjects’ “web savviness” (i.e., how familiar subjects were with
looking up different types of information online). This section contained a list of 12 questions about information that
could be looked up online, but that varied in difficulty (see
Table 1). The answers to easier questions could be searched
for quickly and directly via Google (e.g., “Who is the state
senator for the 28th district in New York state?”), while the
answers to harder questions required multiple searches via
specialized informational platforms (e.g., “What was the high
and low temperature in Rochester, NY on June 9th, 2014?”).
Part 1 instructed subjects to use the internet to locate as many
correct responses as possible in exchange for additional bonus
compensation for each correct response. The proportion of
correct responses in Part 1 provided an indicator of their skill
level and familiarity with looking up information online.
Part 2: Memory test Part 2 measured subjects’ memory
for facts of two distinct types: those than can be easily accessed on the internet (lookupable, e.g., the value of the mathematical constant e) and those that cannot (nonlookupable,
e.g., a locker code). Part 2 asked subjects to read 20 presented facts and memorize as many of them as possible, without the aid of notes. Prior to the start of Part 2, participants
were presented with a practice fact and a follow-up question
to ensure that they fully understood the procedure. After successful completion of the practice question, each subject saw
10 randomly selected facts (from a larger set of 99 facts1 )
of each type, lookupable and nonlookupable, interspersed together with no overt indication of their fact type in a randomized order. (See Table 2.) Each fact appeared on the screen
for 10 seconds.
The 99 facts in the lookupable condition were designed to
be sufficiently obscure in order to minimize the likelihood
that any of the subjects would have known them prior to the
experiment. As an additional check, subjects were asked after the experiment if they knew any of the facts in advance
of the study, and these trials were omitted from further analysis (0.09% of responses). For each fact in the lookupable
condition, a nonlookupable fact was constructed to be similar in terms of form, structure, and complexity. (See Table 2
for example facts.) As a cover explanation for the nonlookupable facts, subjects were told that the facts were compiled
by an elementary school class in Rochester, NY. Thus, the
nonlookupable facts detailed information of a similar type to

the lookupable facts, but pertaining to people on the smaller,
local scale of the elementary school (thus, giving the impression that they were not the sort of facts one could easily look
up online).
A 20-question recall test followed the fact presentation.
Participants were asked to fill in the blanks for 20 fact statements (10 lookupable and 10 nonlookupable). (For an example of the fill-in-the-blank memory test screen, see Figure 1.) Subjects were asked not to use any aids in answering
these questions, including the internet, other people, or any
other information resources they might have available in their
homes. As a check to ensure that they abided by these instructions and did not look answers up online, one of the lookupable fill-in-the-blank facts was replaced by another lookupable fact from the larger 99-fact set that they were not shown
during the fact-presentation phase. Since the lookupable facts
were obscure, a correct answer on this swapped-out fill-inthe-blank fact (which the subject had not seen during the testing phase) would likely indicate use of the internet. Thus,
subjects who answered this question correctly could be omitted from further analysis. In our 150-person sample, none
were omitted for this reason because all subjects answered
this question incorrectly.
At the conclusion of the study, subjects were asked to report any facts they encountered throughout the experiment
that they knew in advance of the experiment. Facts that subjects reported knowing in advance were omitted from the
memory task analysis (0.09% of responses). Additionally, 3
subjects reported knowing facts in advance of the experiment
that they were not shown during the experiment, suggesting
that they had either completed the study previously with different Mechanical Turk accounts2 or that they received information about the task from other subjects, either due to
being physically present while another subject completed the

could not complete the task again.

from further analysis.

Analysis
We first compared the mean accuracy of subjects’ performance on the memory test by fact type (lookupable and nonlookupable) using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test paired by subject. To test our hypothesis controlling for subject and item
effects, we used a mixed-effect regression predicting accuracy from fact type, web savviness, and their interaction. We
also included random intercepts by item, along with slopes
and intercepts for subject (Gelman & Hill, 2007). This analysis ensured that any differences we observed in group means
by fact type were not driven by differences in individual items

Figure 2: Memory test accuracy by fact type (lookupable versus nonlookupable). Subjects more accurately remembered
significantly more nonlookupable facts than lookupable facts
(52.8% versus 44.6%, V=3297.5, p< 0.0002), consistent with
the hypothesis that subjects would preferentially encode information that they believed to be less available in the future.
The error bars depict 95% confidence intervals. Note that the
memory test involved free-recall responses, and thus chance
performance is likely to be very low (not 50%) since free recall of arbitrary facts is difficult.

or subjects.

strated greater skill with looking facts up online also performed better on the memory test overall. The regression
also revealed a marginally significant interaction between fact
type and web savviness (β=0.030, t=1.653, p<0.10), suggesting that those who were more web savvy showed a stronger
tendency to better remember nonlookupable facts. This effect is also apparent in Figure 3, which shows both the group
mean effect along the solid blue line at 8.2% (mean accuracy on nonlookupable facts minus that for lookupable facts)
and the interaction along the red dashed line. The effect size
increases for more web savvy subjects, consistent with our
hypothesis.

Results
Accuracy on the memory test by fact type is depicted in Figure 2. Subjects more accurately remembered the nonlookupable facts (52.8%) than the lookupable facts (44.6%), consistent with the hypothesis that subjects would preferentially
encode information that they believed to be less available in
the future. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test (with continuity correction) paired by subject found this difference to be highly
significant (V=3297.5, p< 0.0002). It is important to note that
the memory test here involved free recall, and that chance performance on free recall of arbitrary facts is likely to be well
below both fact-type means (i.e., well below 50%), meaning
subjects performed above chance for both fact types.
The results of the mixed-effect regression are in Table 3.
The mixed-effect regression revealed a main effect of fact
type (β=0.085, t=4.759, p<0.0001), such that subjects were
more accurate on the memory test for nonlookupable facts.
The regression also revealed a main effect of web savviness
(β=0.042, t=2.617, p< 0.01), such that those who demon-

Conclusion and Discussion
The results suggest that human learners strategically encode
into memory information that they expect to be unavailable in
the future. Further, our data suggest that learners track their
expectations about what information they expect to be available automatically and continuously, even in the absence of
any explicit cue. This finding characterizes the memory system as resource-rational, automatically seeking to minimize

unnecessarily stored information.
More broadly, our results demonstrate that human learners possess some metacognitive awareness of their ability to
look things up online. Further, our results show that those
who are better at it also offload more lookupables from memory. Given the increased availability of information on the
internet, these results have interesting implications for how
new technologies might be expected to influence fundamental aspects of our basic cognitive processes. Specifically, they
suggest that human memory makes efficient use of these new
technologies by deprioritizing storing information that can be
easily accessed on an as-needed basis elsewhere. This finding is in line with other work that demonstrates that memory efficiently favors encoding information that is not readily
accessible via another external source such as a photo (e.g.,
Henkel, 2014) or a partner (e.g., Engestrom, Brown, Engestrom, & Koistinen, 1990; Harris, 1978; Wegner, Erber, &
Raymond, 1991). However, this idea stands in stark opposition to some theories that posit that the availability of information on the internet should have a negative effect on the
functionality of human memory because people may “fail to
distinguish between information stored online and information stored in their own minds” (Ward, 2013). These findings
could have major implications for future studies of learning,
memory, and attention, in addition to obvious applications in
the domains of clinical research (e.g., more effectively treating learning disorders, ADHD) and educational policies (e.g.,
more effective curriculum in schools).
The effect observed here likely reflects a strategy for reducing cognitive load. Memory tracks the availability of information it encounters and deprioritizes encoding material
that is available elsewhere. This strategy is very similar to a
now well established efficient encoding strategy in memory
that involves prior knowledge. Just as memory may utilize
prior knowledge to reduce cognitive load when encoding new
information (e.g., Bartlett, 1982; Bower, Black, & Turner,
1979; Hemmer & Steyvers, 2009; Schank & Abelson, 1977),
memory may utilize knowledge of informational accessibility
similarly.
Further work will be needed to ascertain the potential importance of context on this effect. In this experiment, subjects completed the web-savviness assessment in advance of
being asked to memorize facts for testing. It is possible that
this framing of the task put them in a state of mind that cued
them into tracking what facts were lookupable versus which
were not. Alternatively, it is also possible that human learners

track this fact about the world regardless of particular context.
Follow-up work that counterbalances the order of the memory
test and the web-savviness assessment is in progress.
The fact that the interaction between fact type and web
savviness attained only marginal significance in the mixedeffect regression will require further investigation. One limiting factor on this analysis was that the population of subjects
were all relatively web savvy, likely due to the fact that they
were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk, an interface that
only attracts relatively web-savvy users (see Figure 4). This is
evidenced by the fact that the median score on the 12-question
web-savviness assessment was a 10. It could be the case that
the interaction lacked the power required to reach significance
because of this limiting factor.
Though the size of effect observed here was modest, it was
highly significant. It should be noted that further work will
be needed to understand the true effect size. In our experi-

1462

ment, the facts were matched as closely as possible for structure and complexity; however, they differed, by necessity of
the design, in terms of the scale on which they applied. The
lookupable facts referred to things of broad significance in
the world (e.g., world records, events of historic significance)
while the nonlookupable facts were only of significance on a
smaller scale that was highly removed from the subjects we
tested (e.g., personal facts and records at a local elementary
school). A subject might, for example, want to recall an interesting obscure fact about a world record at a cocktail party.
In contrast, it is unlikely that a subject would want to recall
a similar, even more obscure fact about a record at an elementary school to which they have no personal connection.
The lookupable facts are thus likely to induce more curiosity
in subjects, which has been demonstrated to lead to stronger
encoding into memory (Kang et al., 2009). This effect is thus
likely working against the one we sought to study—the effect
of expectations of future inaccessibility of the information on
memory—because it likely made the lookupable facts more
memorable. Thus, the true effect size of informational inaccessibility on memory may actually be greater than what we
have reported here.
