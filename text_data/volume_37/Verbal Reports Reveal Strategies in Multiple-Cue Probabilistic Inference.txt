between stocks and selecting a stock based on the first
discriminating indicator, participants using TTB should
make more single-indicator elaboration and decision
statements. Alternatively, because WADD and TAL involve
combining information across multiple indicators within
stocks, participants using WADD and TAL should make
more multi-indicator elaboration and decision statements.
   To test this hypothesis, we calculated the relative
proportions of single-indicator elaboration and decision
statements – that is the number of single-indicator
statements divided by the total number of single- and multi-
indicator statements. We compared these proportions
between participants who were classified as using a non-
compensatory (TTB) or compensatory (WADD/TAL)
strategy based on their choices (Fig. 3). Relative to
participants who used WADD or TAL, those who used TTB
made more single-indicator elaboration (t(16) = 3.12, p <
.01) and decision statements (t(16) = 4.39, p < .001).
