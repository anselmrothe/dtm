differences in distance estimates between the two phases.
   Finally, in Condition Five, we once again tested whether a
reversal requires a discrepancy in the action capabilities of
the participant and the experimenter during Phase Two.
However, this time we equated the action capabilities of the
participant and the experimenter in Phase Two by having
the participant wear a weighted backpack, (versus having
the experimenter wear no backpack during Phase Two, as
we did in Condition Three). Again, if a Phase Two
discrepancy in action capabilities is necessary for a reversal,
then there should be no reversal in Condition Five.
   While a full model would have provided a more robust
series of results, these five conditions were carefully chosen
to address the subtleties of our assumptions that both (1) a
memory of carrying a weighted backpack, and (2) the
presence of an action-capability discrepancy between the
participant and the experimenter would result in perceived
distances that are greater when not carrying a weighted
backpack than when carrying one.
