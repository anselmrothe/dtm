Figure 1: (a) Schematic representation of a typical multiple object tracking (MOT) task. (b) Graphical description of a hier-
archical model for tracking N objects simultaneously. The lower level state estimate s is computed using a bank of Kalman
filters which predict particle locations with an accuracy that is influenced by their spatial resolution. (c) The scale of spatial
resolution for a filter at any time step is determined by the attention allocated to it by the top-level model of attention dynamics.
This model obtains information about the confusability of tracking targets from the filter predictions and rationally allocates
attention to minimize overall confusability constrained by its attention budget.
