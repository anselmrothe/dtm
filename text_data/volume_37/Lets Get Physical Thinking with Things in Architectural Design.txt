Bilda and Demirkan, 2003); considerably less has been done
on how they think with physical objects (Kim and Maher
2008; Maher et al, 2014), either when making a model of a
nearly completed structure or in the early conceptual phases
of design. Our goal in this qualitative study is to understand
how architects make use of physical blocks to arrive at an
early conception of a building design. Seventeen subjects
were positioned in front of a 4’ x 4’ wooden model of a
generic building site (Figure 1). Their task was to design
their dream house from 3D printed blocks scattered on the
site. We report here on how the blocks were used to
facilitate creative design thinking. We found trends that
suggest more experienced designers exhibit physical
behaviors that distinguish them from novices. In addition,
we argue that these interactive strategies enable forms of
thought that would be hard if not impossible to reach
otherwise.
                          Background
Architects make many types of physical models including
massing models, concept models, detail models, section
models and many more. They use materials like paper,
                                                                            Figure 1: Architectural model-making as block assembly

charged objects. Such manipulations have been called
epistemic to differentiate them from actions that are
performed on things that satisfy pragmatic goals such as
eating, running from danger, driving to work, etc. (Kirsh
Maglio, 1994). Our work here is a baby step toward
understanding how a few blocks can be used to think
creatively about architectural design solutions.

In Figure 2 we show the site on which the subjects were to

subjects parallelepipeds. These shapes are close enough to
cubes to look familiar and be useful in a construction task,
but different enough to offer surprises and allow for a
variety of spatial relationships, an important aspect of
architectural design. This is achieved through the
asymmetrical nature of the parallelepiped. When a
parallelepiped is rotated 90 degrees, or when a subject
repositions him or herself, the shapes that are in view are all
different. This contrasts with a cube, where because of its 48
symmetries, each 90° rotation, whether in the X, Y, Z or
diagonal axes, yields the same shapes and appearance

Coding Scheme As this is a novel analysis of the physical
interactions exhibited by architectural designers in early
stage design, a vital first step is to establish a coding scheme
that captures behaviors at a broad enough level to be
applicable to related research and future studies, and yet
specific enough to identify behaviors and strategies unique
to architectural design. Our scheme in Table 1 creates a
framework that establishes ten interaction types that occur
between different parts of the body (hands, head, and full
body), the blocks, and the site. The illustrations in Figure 5
convey three different interactions visually.
   The ten interaction types are grouped within three
categories: inspectional, exploratory, and transitional.
Inspectional interactions do not directly support the
assembly of a configuration of blocks. For example, as seen
in Figure 5A, Ins.B, is an interaction type in which the
subject picks up a block off the surface of the site and
manipulates it in space. In this case, the subject is focused
only on the block’s properties such as its shape, shading, or
weight. This can be distinguished from an exploratory
interaction such as Ex.B.H (Figure 5B) in which the subject
is building a configuration of blocks on the site while also
reorienting his head. In this situation, relationships between
multiple blocks and the site are being explored. Both of
these categories can be distinguished from transitional
interactions. For example, with Tran.B the subject is                  Figure 5: Illustrations of interaction types from the coding
