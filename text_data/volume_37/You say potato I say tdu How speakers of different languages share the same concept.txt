In the right hemisphere, the frontal orbital cortex (r=0.78),
anterior cingulate gyrus (r=0.76), anterior supramarginal

(r=0.92) also produced decoding scores of 1.0.
   Cross-language correlation was a strong predictor of this

regions that correlated highly between languages were not

middle temporal gyrus (r=0.79, Acc=0.29). In these regions,
even higher correlations were obtained for incorrect
permutations of the words, leading to lower neural
