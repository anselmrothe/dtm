smaller embedded chunks they contain, this might help to
explain participants’ performance in Experiments 1 and 2.
   Servan-Schreiber and Anderson’s (1990) ‘competitive
chunking’ model proposes that (1) learners may be able to
represent both lower-order chunks and the higher-order
chunks that contain them, and (2) the familiarity of a
sequence depends on the number of stored chunks needed to
describe it. Thus, when participants viewed pairs and
embedded pairs at test in Experiment 2, these sequences
may have seemed equally familiar because pairs and
embedded pairs were each represented by a single chunk,
not because participants represented their underlying TPs.         Figure 4. Sample triplets and illusory triplets used in Expt.
