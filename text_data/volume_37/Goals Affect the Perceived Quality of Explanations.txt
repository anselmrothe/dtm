not differ, t(411)=.63, p=.531. Ratings were also higher

    Most importantly, we found a significant interaction

planned contrasts motivated by our prediction that
explanation ratings would be higher in the context of a
congruent goal. Three separate contrasts compared ratings
of formal, mechanistic, and teleological explanations in the
context of the congruent goal versus the average of ratings
for that explanation type in the other three goal conditions.

    As a further test of the relationship between explanatory
preferences and goals, we classified participants based on
the explanation type for which they gave the highest average
ratings. Twenty ties (18 between causal and teleological
explanations) were excluded. As shown in Figure 2a, the
distribution of explanation preferences varied significantly
across goals, χ2(9,N=392)=31.87, p<.001. Based on
