                       Experiment 2
   In Experiment 2, participants completed a shortened
version of the delay discounting task. Before each
discounting trial, participants indicated whether they
represent the delay interval as distant from the present. The
psychological distance hypothesis predicts that, at each
delay interval, participants will be more likely to choose the
future reward if they represent the delay as close to the
present. The future priming hypothesis predicts that there
will be no effect of representational distance.

participants were recruited in the same manner as

                       Experiment 3
   In Experiment 3, representational distance was assessed
by asking participants to rate a list of time intervals as close
to or distant from the present. Participants also completed
the full-length delay discounting task from Experiment 1.
Task order was counterbalanced between participants. The
psychological distance hypothesis predicts that participants
who represent the future as close to the present will be more
likely to wait for future rewards, and that there will be no
effect of task order on delay discounting.
