indicate that the slowed language processing may
contribute to the lifelong risks for other negative
consequences associated with lower SES. It is also possible
that SES-related differences in the pace of language
processing disappear in adulthood, only to shift to
difficulties in other, perhaps more subtle aspects of
language processing. For example, adolescents with SLI do
not differ from typically-developing peers in the speed or
accuracy of anticipatory processing during sentence
comprehension. Instead, they fail to activate less-likely
sentence completions as the sentence unfolds, suggesting
differences in real-time dynamics of lexical activation
(Borovsky et. al, 2013). Similarly, differences in the
quantity of lifetime language experiences between higher
and lower SES groups (Hart & Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003)
may shift the degree to which listeners activate uncertain
or unexpected outcomes during linguistic processing.
   We explore these issues by measuring the relationship
between childhood SES and language processing skills in
college-aged adults. Specifically, we compare performance
on an eyetracking task that has previously highlighted
differences in anticipatory speed and lexical activation
during sentence processing (Borovsky et al., 2012, 2013).
