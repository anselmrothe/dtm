Procedure
The procedure utilized a modified paradigm from
Richardson et al. (2015). Participant pairs were instructed to
perform the same repetitive targeting task in which they
each moved a small (5 cm diameter) red dot between two
square targets (20 cm) positioned in each of the four corners
of a 50 inch computer monitor. Participants stood back-to-
back each facing their own monitor. (See Figure 1 top).
Each participant moved their stimulus dot such that one
participant moved their stimulus between the bottom-left
and top-right target while the other participant moved their
stimulus between the bottom-right and top-left target. A
Polhemus FASTRACK magnetic motion tracking system
was used record the movement of each participant’s right
hand and to control participant stimuli in real time.
   Upon arrival participants were informed that they would
be participating in an experiment investigating joint action
and would be playing a game in which they were required to                  Figure 2. Representative movement trajectories.

Although this result is consistent with the findings of
Richardson et al. (2015), it is important to note that the
overall degree of elipticality was much less pronounced in
the current study. It should be noted that although some
participant pairs did still adopt complementary roles, the
overall degree of this asymmetry was much less pronounced
than that observed by Richardson et al.
