Manipulation Check
To check whether our model quality manipulation was
effective we first examined the manipulation check.
Participants in the good model groups obtained significantly
higher scores (M = 2.54, SD = 3.21) for drawing and
computing torque parallelograms than participants in the
poor model groups (M = 0.43, SD = 1.55), F(1,75) = 14.26,
MSE = 5.99, p < .001, η2 = .16. This is evidence that the
manipulation indeed provided participants in the good
model group with the model of torques as the area of a
parallelogram.
Testing our Hypothesis: Interaction Between Goal
Specificity and Model Quality
Based on the three-space theory we predicted that the effect            Figure 2. Mean posttest scores for each of the four groups
