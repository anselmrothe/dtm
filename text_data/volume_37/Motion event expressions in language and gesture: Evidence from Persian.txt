The Current Study
We reviewed evidence on the sensitivity of gestures to the
structure of the language that they accompany. These results
point to a close correspondence between the linguistic and
gesture systems. The question is whether there are other
factors that limit this one to one correspondence. Results of
Karaduman et al. (2015), which show similar gesture
production in spite of linguistic differences, point to a
common component to gestures, one that may mirror
universals of human cognition, rather than specifics of a
language.
