   In contrast, Geurts (2006) proposes, that numerals, when
used as quantifiers, are lexically ambiguous between two dis-
tinct lexical entries corresponding to the at least and exactly
readings. In this approach the exactly reading is still more
basic, whereas the at least lexical entry can be obtained by
a number of type-shifting operations. A different version of
the ambiguity account has been offered by Spector (2013).
Building on the grammatical account of scalar implicatures
by Chierchia et al. (2012), Spector argues that albeit numer-
als are not lexically ambiguous, they give rise to ambiguities
