                           Background
   We tend to think of ourselves as expert pattern
recognizers, but our visual system often detects patterns
where they do not exist. Pareidolia refers to the tendency to
detect familiar shapes or patterns in otherwise random                       Figure 1: (A) An image of the Cydonia region of Mars taken by

up to 33 frames of random pixel arrays refreshing at a frame
rate of 2.5Hz. The initial 8 frames served to entrain one of 4
repetitive motion patterns: up-down, right-left, up-up, or
right-right motion. We generated these motion patterns by
shifting a single random pixel array by 4 pixels along one of
the cardinal axes across subsequent frames (see Fig. 2-top).
The level of noise during these 8 priming frames was set to
20%; that is, in each frame, 20% of pixels were randomized,
producing a hazy, but still clearly discernable motion
pattern. Beyond the 8th frame, the noise level increased to
100%; all pixels were randomized from frame to frame,
until the end of the trial (Fig. 2-bottom). Participants were
instructed to fixate on a central cross and press a button
when they could no longer perceive the primed motion
pattern, at which point the trial ended. In the absence of any
illusory perception, we would expect most responses to
occur during frames 9 and 10, allowing up to 800ms for
individuals to produce the required motor response.
                                                                                Figure 3: (A) Results of Experiment 1. The distribution of

   These results demonstrate that simple motion patterns,
such as up-down or right-right motion, can be entrained and

85% of the time. In Experiment 2, we designed a motion
identification task to measure motion pareidolia in a more
objective task and test whether illusory motion percepts can
arise spontaneously, without entrainment.
         Experiment 2: False Identification
Methods
Participants were 46 UC Santa Cruz undergraduates (61%
female, ages 18-22) who gave written consent and received
course credit for completing the study. Participants
completed 192 motion identification trials in which they
were shown 6-frame sequences of random pixel textures
refreshing at 2.5Hz, similar to the stimuli in Experiment 1.
After each sequence, participants were instructed to click on
one of 5 buttons on the screen to indicate whether the
sequence depicted one of 4 motion patterns (again, up-
down, right-left, up-up, or right-right) or whether the
sequence was "random". Across trials, we manipulated the
noise level present in each frame, from 0% (pure motion),
33%, 67%, to 100% (pure noise). We measured
performance in the motion identification task and the
distribution of responses as a function of noise.
