Many people who wrongly answer the MHD are highly
confident in their wrong answers (Falk, 1992), and what is
striking is that people often show a high level of resistance
and even impatience upon being shown the correct solution
(Rosenhouse, 2009). Some particularly strong responses
recorded by vos Savant (1997) included “The switch
strategy does not lead to any advantage whatsoever despite
vos Savant’s mumbo-jumbo of an explanation”, and “You
blew it, and you blew it big! ... There is enough
mathematical illiteracy in this country… Shame!” The
present study explores why there is a high level of resistance
to the correct solution, and in particular the effect of
individual differences on how convincing different solution
explanations appear to be.

Abstract
The Monty Hall Dilemma (MHD) is a classic brain teaser that
even mathematicians appear to consistently answer
incorrectly, and when the correct solution is presented people
remain unconvinced. We examined how convincing were
three solution types: a simple statement of the solution, a
guided diagram solution, or simulated trials. Participants were
given the MHD, followed by one of the three types of
solutions, then we measured their level of conviction and
their numeracy, Cognitive Reflection (CR), Need for
Cognition (NFC), and Openness. Overall, both guided
diagrams and simulated trials led to higher conviction
compared to a simple solution statement. Higher numeracy
and higher CR were associated with lower conviction after
the simple solution; furthermore higher numeracy tended to
help more in the simulation condition, whereas higher CR
helped more in the guided condition. Therefore the
persuasiveness of a solution depended both on its nature and
characteristics of individual reasoners.

Resistance and Individual Differences

Keywords: Reasoning, Monty Hall Dilemma, individual
differences, cognitive reflection, belief revision

Introduction
The Monty Hall Dilemma (MHD) is a probability puzzle
that involves the reasoner choosing one of three identical
doors. One door conceals a prize while the other two doors
conceal worthless items. After an initial choice is made, the
host, who is aware of where the prize is located, must open
a non-chosen door to reveal a worthless item. The
participant then has to choose whether to stay with the
initial choice or switch to the remaining unopened door. The
MHD is named after the host of a television game show
Let’s Make a Deal, Monty Hall, but despite seeming simple
its counterintuitive answer has baffled both the general
public and expert mathematicians (Friedman, 1998;
Granberg & Brown, 1995; Burns & Wieth, 2004). The
correct analysis is that switching doors yields twice the
chance of winning that staying with the original door does.
However, the most common response is that switching or
staying does not matter because the probability for winning
the prize in either case would be equal, so people stay with
their original choice.
The MHD was brought to the public's attention when
Marilyn vos Savant described the problem and its correct
solution to readers of a newspaper column (vos Savant,
1997). Over 90% of readers’ mail argued against the
counterintuitive solution, a large number of whom were
self-described professors and mathematicians.

It is fascinating that some people show a particularly high
level of resistance when presented with the MHD solution
(vos Savant, 1997), but there is a lack of empirical data
examining individual differences. The responses to vos
Savant’s (1997) solution show that mathematicians and
intellectuals can show strong resistance towards the
solution, given that 65% of the 10,000 letters written to her
were from respondents at universities (Granberg & Brown,
1995). This unsystematic data suggests that an individual
difference such as higher numeracy may decrease
conviction towards the correct MHD solution. In contrast,
measures of better responding to counterintuitive problems
(such as Cognitive Reflection, Frederick, 2005), and of
intellectual curiosity (such as Need for Cognition, Cacioppo,
Petty, Feinstein, & Jarvis, 1996) may be positively
associated with conviction. Finally, the factor of Openness
to Experience (McCrae & Costa, 1997) in the five-factor
model of personality may also be positively associated with
conviction. Therefore we will measure individual
differences in numeracy, Need for Cognition (NFC),
Cognitive Reflection (CR), and Openness to Experience.

Solutions Descriptions that Decrease Resistance
Conviction in the correct answer can be increased by giving
people more elaborate solutions. Quite often the solution to
the MHD is in the form of a simple statement or textual
description, and people are often resistant to it. Two more
in-depth ways of presenting the solution that may increase
conviction in the correct answer are: using a computer
simulation, or a guided diagram. Intriguingly, it is possible
that different individual measures may predict conviction

1273

differently dependent on which one of these in-depth
solutions is presented.
The literature on belief revision suggests that direct
experience contradicting a strong belief can be very
important (Markovits & Schmeltzer, 2007). Studies on the
MHD have shown that experience in the form of simulation
trials facilitates switching doors. For example, Granberg and
Brown (1995) found that doing 50 trials of the MHD
increased the switch rate from 12% to 55%. In the present
study, one of the solution types given was simulated trials
with an explicit statement of the solution afterwards, and we
expect this to increasing conviction in the correct MHD
answer compared to just a simple statement of the solution.
However it may be that this solution type will be most
beneficial for people with higher numeracy since this
solution type provides numerical evidence.

the correct solution when given a simple MHD solution. In
particular those with higher numeracy skill will display less
conviction whereas those with higher CR scores will show
greater conviction. Furthermore, we will test how different
in-depth solutions may be differentially effective depending
on individual differences.

Method
Participants
For this study, 172 first year psychology students from the
University of Sydney were recruited for partial course
credit. 52 participants were excluded, 37 due to having
already seen the MHD, 7 who gave the correct solution at
their first attempt, and 8 due to missing data. Excluded
participants were replaced in the design, so that the final
sample of 120 participants consisted of 100 females and 20
males, with a mean age of 20.02 (SD = 5.06).

Independent Variable

Figure 1: The diagram shown to participants in the guided
condition, adapted from Krauss and Wang (2003).
A less numerical solution that may also decrease
resistance towards the counterintuitive solution could use
guided diagrams. Krauss and Wang (2003) introduced an
explanation of the MHD solution that shows three of the
possible arrangements in the MHD (illustrated in Figure 1).
This explanation has many benefits; it involves participants
actually counting the chances of winning and losing and
also emphasizes the importance of the host knowing where
the prize is rather than the door being opened just by
chance. Thus, it addresses the difficulties people have in
incorrectly representing the MHD, and clearly shows that
the prize would be won in two out of three cases. Such
guided diagrams may facilitate intellectual understanding
and thus may be particularly effective for those scoring
higher on Cognitive Reflection and Need For Cognition,
which focus on reflection and intellectual curiosity.

Aims of the Current Study
The current study focused on the effectiveness of in-depth
solutions for convincing participants of the correct solution
to the MHD, and in particular how individual differences
may moderate this conviction. It is anticipated that
individual differences will be associated with resistance to

Solution Manipulation. Participants were randomly
allocated to one of three conditions: simple solution, guided
solution or a simulation solution.
1. Simple Solution. In the simple solution condition
participants read the following two sentences: “The correct
answer is to switch doors, which would lead to a higher
chance of winning (2 in 3) compared to if you stayed with
the same door (1 in 3). In 2 out of 3 possible car-goat
arrangements, the contestant would win by switching”.
2. Guided Solution. In the guided solution condition
participants were given a diagram adapted from Krauss and
Wang (2003), as shown in Figure 1. This shows the three
possible arrangements of the car and goats and subsequent
chances of winning. The page also included the same
statement given in the simple solution condition.
3. Simulation Solution. In the simulation solution condition
participants chose to switch or stay in 50 simulated trials of
the MHD, and for each trial the computer determined wins
or loses just as a genuine host would. At the end of the 50
trials, the participants were presented with a summary
statement of how many wins they had when switching and
when staying. They were also presented with the same
statement as given in the simple solution.

Dependent Variables
Conviction. The main dependent variable was how
convinced participants were of the correct solution. This
conviction score was gathered on a 5-point Likert scale in
response to the question “How convinced are you that there
is twice as high a chance of winning if you switch doors?”
ranging from completely unconvinced (1) to completely
convinced (5).
Quality of explanation. After their MHD solution was
presented participants explained their own answer. This was
examined as a dichotomous variable, with two independent
raters agreeing on whether the explanation showed some
understanding and acceptance of the correct answer, or an

1274

expression of confusion and/or disagreement. This
qualitative measure of conviction was used to validate the
conviction scores.
Numeracy Scores (SN and ON). The Subjective Numeracy
(SN) score was calculated with the Subjective Numeracy
Scale, adapted from Fagerlin et al. (2007). The scale
consists of 8 items each on a 6-point Likert scale, with one
reverse coded item. The Objective Numeracy (ON) score
was calculated with the Objective Numeracy Scale, adapted
from Lipkus, Samsa and Rimer (2001). The scale consists of
11 items, 9 of which ask for a numerical response and the
remaining 2 ask to choose from three possible numerical
responses.
Cognitive Reflection (CR) Score. The CR score was
calculated from the Cognitive Reflection Test, adapted from
Frederick (2005). The CR test assess the ability to override a
strong incorrect response and reflect further to find the
correct response. It has been shown to be a good predictor
of task performance on tasks testing for heuristics and biases
(Toplak, West, & Stanovich, 2011). The test consists of 3
items, each with a numerical response.
Need for Cognition (NFC) Score. The NFC score was
calculated from the short 18-item form of the Need for
Cognition Test, adapted from Cacioppo, Petty and Feng Kao
(1984). This form of the test has been shown to be a valid
and reliable measure of an individual’s tendency to pursue
and enjoy cognitive activities (Cacioppo et al. 1984;
Cacioppo et al., 1996). The test consists of 18 items each on
a 9-point Likert scale, with 9 reverse coded.
Openness Score and other Personality Measures. The
Openness score was calculated using an IPIP Personality
Test measuring similar constructs to the NEO-PI-R broad
domains, adapted from Goldberg et al. (2006). The test
consists of 50 items each on a 5-point Likert scale, half of
which were reverse coded items. Of the 50 items, 10 items
corresponded to each of the personality variables –
Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
Time spent on viewing solution. For each solution type,
the amount of time spent on viewing or working with the
solution was recorded. The main purpose of this was to
ensure that the differences in conviction between the
solution types were due to the actual solution quality, rather
than just the amount of time spent on the solution.
Switch rate in later trials (Simulation Condition only).
The switch rate of the last 10 trials was recorded for those
given the simulations solution. This could help validate the
conviction scores.

Procedure
The experiment was set up as a series of webpages.
Participants started by answering demographic questions
(gender, age, language spoken at home), then they
completed the Subjective Numeracy Scale and the Objective
Numeracy Scale. Participants were then presented with the
standard Monty Hall Dilemma adapted from Krauss and
Wang (2003). They were asked whether they wished to

switch or stay, their confidence in their response, probability
judgments of both choices, and whether they had seen the
problem before.
Participants then received one of three different types of
solution: simple, guided or simulation, as described above.
All participants were then asked to make probability
judgments of winning for switching and staying, to give a
short explanation of their responses, and to complete the
Likert scale rating for how convinced they were that there is
twice as high a chance of winning if they switch doors.
Finally, they completed the Cognitive Reflection test, the
Need for Cognition test, and a 50 item IPIP personality test.

Results
Preliminary analyses
A preliminary analysis revealed no significant effect of
gender on conviction scores nor on any individual
difference variables (except for SN); as such gender was not
further analyzed or used as a covariate.
There was a significant positive correlation between the
quality of the explanation given by participants after being
shown one of the three solutions, and their conviction
scores; r(120) = 0.40, p < 0.001. Thus conviction ratings
were related to a more descriptive explanation of agreement
with the answer. For those in the simulation condition, there
was a significant correlation between the switch rate in the
last 10 trials and these participants’ conviction scores, r(40)
= 0.36, p = 0.024. These findings support the validity of the
conviction scores.

Effect of Solution
An analysis of variance was run to examine the effect of the
solution manipulation (simple, guided, simulation) on how
convinced participants were on the 5-point Likert scale.
Mean conviction score was 2.18 (SD = 1.24) for the simple
condition, 2.80 (SD = 1.20) for the guided condition and
3.33 (SD = 1.14) for the simulation condition. As expected,
there was a statistically significant difference in conviction
score as a function of solution type, F(2,114) = 9.171, p <
0.001.
Planned but non-orthogonal contrasts revealed that the
guided solution produced significantly higher conviction
scores than the simple solution on average, F(1,117) = 5.48,
p = 0.021. Similarly, the simulation solution produced
significantly higher conviction scores than the simple
solution on average, F(1,117) = 18.54, p < 0.001. There
were no predictions for differences between the guided and
simulation solution conditions, but an exploratory post-hoc
contrast analysis was carried out. Even without taking into
account that this test was posthoc, the difference was not
statistically significant, F(1,117) = 3.86, p = 0.052.
Time Spent on Viewing Solution. The amount of time
spent on viewing the solution was measured as a potential
covariate. Overall, time spent on task had a significant
correlation with conviction score, as expected; r(120) =
0.281, p = 0.002. However, time spent on task was not

1275

significantly correlated within any of the three solution
conditions. This support the claim that difference in
conviction score between the three conditions are due to the
condition itself and not just to how long participants spend
on the solution. However, it was considered that time spent
on the solution was potentially a confounding factor for
interactions between individual differences and solution
type. Time spent on solution fundamentally differed across
each solution type, therefore it was added as a covariate in
subsequent interaction analyses.

Examination of Individual Differences
The subjective and objective numeracy scales used in this
study are known to be closely associated (Fagerlin et al.,
2007) and in the current study were found to have a
moderate correlation; r(120) = 0.414, p < 0.001. It was
decided it was simpler to focus on one measure of
numeracy, and given that SN (but not ON) correlated with
gender, r(120) = 0.198, p = 0.030, it was decided to focus
on the objective ON scores.

contrasts and ON (Model 2). There was no significant main
effect of numeracy (ON) on conviction score on its own, R2
= 0.031, df = 118, p = 0.056.
The interactions between ON scores and conviction were
tested as three sets of orthogonal contrast analyses between
the solution types where time spent on solution was added
as a covariate. These are summarized in Table 2 (Model 2
only). Since there were 3 sets of analyses, α was divided by
3, and thus interactions were significant if they had a pvalue was smaller than 0.0167. Table 2 again shows that
both guided and simulation conditions had an increased
conviction over that observed in the simple condition, but
also that there were statistically significant interactions
between numeracy and solution type in predicting
conviction scores.

scores predicted by interaction of Objective Numeracy (ON)
and solution type (N = 120). For space consideration only

Variable

Correlations between conviction scores and ON and CR
scores were calculated for each condition separately (see
Table 1). In the simple condition, as predicted, there was a
significant negative correlation between ON and conviction
scores suggesting that for a simple solution, higher
numeracy reduced conviction in the solution. However
contrary to predicted, CR and conviction scores were also
negatively correlated in the simple condition.
ON and CR scores were positively correlated, r(120) =
0.397, p < .01. However although none of correlations in
Table 1 for guided and simulation conditions were
statistically significant, the pattern of correlations for CR
and ON differed in an intriguing way. The correlation
between conviction and ON is still negative in the guided
condition but slightly positive in the simulation condition.
However the opposite pattern is observed for conviction and
CR correlations, it is negative in the simulation condition
but slightly positive in the guided condition.
To test whether individual differences interacted with
solution condition in their impact on conviction a series of
regression analyses were carried out, one set for numeracy
(ON) scores and one set for Cognitive Reflection (CR)
scores.
Numeracy (ON) Interactions. To examine the impact of
ON scores on conviction regression analyses were
conducted first by entering contrasts between the solution
types (Model 1) then adding interactions between these

where ‘non-simul’ refers to the two solution conditions

in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant

larger relationship between ON and conviction in the
simulation condition compared to either the simple
condition or the combination of the two non-simulation
conditions. However none of the contrasts with the guided
condition were statistically significant. Therefore they
suggest that the simulation condition reduced the negative
impact of ON scores observed in the simple condition.

As suggested by the pattern of correlations shown in
Table 1 for CR and conviction scores, Table 3 shows that
they had a statistically significant stronger relationship in
the guided condition verse the simple condition or the
combination of the other two conditions. None of the
contrast with the simulation condition were significant.
Therefore, in contrast to the ON scores, it was the guided
condition that reduced the negative impact of higher CR
scores observed in the simple condition. This suggests a
three-way interaction between condition and CR and ON

scores, but we lacked the statistical power for a strong test
of that hypothesis.
Need for Cognition (NFC). A linear regression analysis
found no significant effect of NFC scores on the conviction
score, R2 = 0.017, df = 118, p = 0.156. There were also no
significant interactions between NFC scores and solution.
Openness to Experience. A linear regression analysis
found no significant main effect of Openness on the
conviction score as expected, R2 = 0.005, df = 118, p =
0.429, and no significant interactions between Openness
scores and solution types in predicting conviction scores.
Exploration of scores on other personality variables also
found no relationships with conviction.

Discussion
As expected, solution type affected how convinced people
were of the answer to the counterintuitive MHD. Both a
guided diagram format and a simulation format led to more
conviction than a simple text format. Furthermore, in the
simple solution condition there were significant negative
relationships between conviction and both numeracy and
cognitive reflection, thus we supported the anecdotal
observation that it is the people usually in the best position
to solve probability problems like the MHD that were least
convinced by its correct answer.
This study provided evidence that the effectiveness of
these solution types interacts with individual differences.
The significant negative relationship between numeracy and
conviction for those given the simple solution was
significantly different compared to the slightly positive
relationship between these scores in the simulation solution
(although this positive relationship itself was not
significant). In contrast, the significant negative relationship
between CR and conviction for those given the simple
solution was significantly different compared to the positive
relationship between these scores in the guided condition. It
appears that having higher numeracy or higher CR does not
necessarily increase conviction in the simulation and guided
conditions respectively, but in the appropriate solution
conditions those scores no longer act as much as barriers to
conviction as they may have in the simple condition.
However, we were not able to perform a strong analysis of
the implied three-way interactions on conviction between
solution type and the individual differences of CR and ON.
Therefore follow-up studies are necessary to test whether
the differential impact of these individual differences for
different solutions is reliable.
Previous studies have found that simulated trials of the
MHD increased the correct switch rate response (Friedman,
1998; Granberg & Brown, 1995; Tubau & Alonso, 2003;
Franco-Watkins, Derks, & Dougherty, 2003), and diagrams
have been found to assist learning from misconceptions
(Marcus, Cooper, & Sweller, 1996; Tubau & Alonso, 2003).
We have extended these earlier findings by looking at a
measure of conviction specifically, rather than focusing on
improved switch rates or answers. We more explicitly
measured resistance to the correct answer. However, it is

1277

important to note that although both of the in-depth
solutions were associated with significantly higher
conviction scores compared to the simple solution, the
average conviction rating remained below “slightly
convinced”. As such, there still appears to be resistance
despite these more in-depth solutions.
By confirming the possibly harmful effect of numeracy on
conviction towards the simply stated MHD solution, our
results provide an explanation for why so many of vos
Savant’s (1997) persistent respondents were mathematicians
and professors. Those who have a higher level of numeracy
may answer the MHD in a way that is correct according to
their inappropriate representation, so their failure is one of
representation rather than ability. They may then be more
resistant towards the solution knowing that they usually
have a high ability to solve mathematical problems.
Cognitive Reflection (CR) scores were predicted to have a
positive correlation with conviction but the opposite was
found. A higher CR reduced conviction in the MHD when
given a simple solution. This is fascinating because the CR
test involves solving counterintuitive problems itself, so
participants who tended to be better at solving
counterintuitive problems were less convinced by a simple
solution to the MHD, which is a different counterintuitive
problem. This may be because solving the MHD requires
more than just a reflection on whether the apparently correct
solution is in fact correct, instead a large nonobvious change
in its representation is required. Perhaps when the reflection
reveals no change, confidence in problem solving ability
increases resistance to the correct solution just as it does for
numeracy.
There were no significant effects or interactions on
conviction scores found between solution type and Need for
Cognition (NFC) or Openness to Experience. However we
cannot rule out that other measures of these variables may
have shown effects.
An implication of the study is that the MHD may be an
appropriate model for examining belief perseverance. Past
studies on belief perseverance have tended to focus on
subjective world beliefs, or fictitious beliefs that are induced
experimentally to participants (e.g., Markovits &
Schmeltzer, 2007). The persistence and strength of
resistance to a mathematically correct answer to the MHD
may make it a good task for testing how belief revision
occurs.
