movements. In particular, measures of power-law scaling in
reading times that quantify the regularity of the reading
process have recently been shown to make for superior
predictors of text comprehension compared to standard
measures such as reading speed (Wallot, O’Brien,
Haussmann, Kloos, & Lyby, 2014). However, these findings
were obtained in self-paced reading tasks in which readers
press a response key to reveal each new word. Self-paced
reading tasks show in general similar results compared to
eye movements during reading (Rayner & Pollatsek, 1994).
However, we seek now to expand the findings of Wallot et
al. (2014) to a more generic framework by investigating eye
movements during reading. Whereas Wallot et al. (2014)
used times between key presses in self-paced reading, we
used eye-tracking data for measures of the reading process.
   In the following sections, we will give a brief introduction
of power-law scaling in the context of eye movements, then
describe the rationale of the study and the selection of the
dependent variables, and finally present results on the
relation between the reading process (as viewed through eye
movement measures) and reading comprehension.

Procedure
To read each story, participants came to the laboratory two
times on two different days (presentation order was
counterbalanced across participants). During reading,
participants sat in front of the computer monitor, app. 79 cm
away from the screen. Experimenters instructed participants
that the text would be displayed either sentence-by-sentence
or screen-by-screen (this mode remained constant within
each participant, so that each participant read both stories in
the same way), and that the eye-tracker would record their
eye movements during reading.
   Experimenters asked participants to read the text at their
natural reading speed. After participants finished reading,
experimenters asked participants to rate text difficulty, write
a brief summary2, and to complete a comprehension
questionnaire of which they had been forewarned. Each
questionnaire consisted of 36 statements about the text that
participants had to judge as being right or wrong.
Data Analysis
A total of 4.7% of the data were lost due to the eye tracker
loosing the eyes during reading or participants looking away
from the screen.                                                       Figure 3. Scaling function of gaze steps and associated
