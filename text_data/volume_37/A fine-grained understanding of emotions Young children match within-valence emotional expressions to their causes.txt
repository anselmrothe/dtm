   To ensure that the stimuli did indeed elicit natural and
distinctive emotional vocalizations, we asked two female
adults to look at each scene and respond as spontaneously as
possible, out loud, but without any words. (See Methods.)
Their vocalizations were recorded. We then paired each
vocal expression with two candidate causes (only one of
which was actually used to elicit the vocalization) and
looked at whether children (ages two to four) and adults
could link the vocalization with the eliciting cause of the
emotion. We predicted that, contradictory to previous
research, even young children could discriminate within-
valence emotional expressions and identify their causes.                      Figure 1 Eliciting cause stimuli. See text for details.
