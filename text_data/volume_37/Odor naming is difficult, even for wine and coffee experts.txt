Yeshurun & Sobel, 2010). There appear to be no basic
words for smell (Sperber, 1975/1974). Odors appear to be
ineffable (cf. Levinson & Majid, 2014).
However, a recent study shows poor odor naming might
be a product of WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized,
Rich and Democratic) cultures (Henrich, Heine, &
Norenzayan, 2010). Majid and Burenhult (2014) tested Jahai
speakers, a group of hunter-gatherers living on the Malay
Peninsula in an odor naming task, and compared them to a
matched sample of English speakers. The Jahai were as
consistent in naming odors as they were in naming colors.
Moreover, they were more consistent in naming odors than
English speakers. A more qualitative look at the data
showed that while English speakers overwhelmingly used
source-based descriptions to name smells (as found in
previous studies), Jahai speakers used a small set of abstract
or “basic” smell terms. These are words which exclusively
refer to smell qualities: the terms do not derive from a
source; they apply to a broad class of objects; they are
psychologically salient to the Jahai; and they appear in all
genres of conversation (Burenhult & Majid, 2011). There
are as many as 12 basic odor terms in Jahai. For example,
the smell of bat droppings, smoke, ginger root, and
petroleum are all described with the word cŋɛs, and the
smell of various flowers, perfumes, durian, and bearcat
(Arctictis binturong) are named ltpɨt.
For the Jahai smell plays a significant role, not only in
language, but in various other facets of life, such as religion
and medicine (Burenhult & Majid, 2011). For example, it is
taboo to wash raw game meat from different species at the
same time in the river. This is because the blood of each
animal has a distinct smell and mixing these smells is
prohibited. For the Jahai a cultural preoccupation with odors
aligns with high codability of smells in language. This raises
the question of whether other cultural practices involving
smell may also lead to greater ease in odor naming.
In the West, smells play a significant role in the lives of
various professionals, for example, perfumers and flavor
experts (such as wine and coffee experts). Flavor is a
multisensory percept, consisting of orthonasal (through the
nose), and retronasal (through the mouth) olfaction
alongside taste (for a review on the multisensory perception
of flavour see Auvray & Spence, 2008). Thus, olfaction is in
large part responsible for how we perceive the taste of the
things we eat and drink. Wine, coffee, cheese, and chocolate
would all taste bland without the sense of smell. For this
reason a large part of flavor experts’ training focuses on
olfaction (cf. Herdenstam, Hammarén, Ahlström, &

Abstract
Odor naming is difficult for people, but recent cross-cultural
research suggests this difficulty is culture-specific. Jahai
speakers (hunter-gatherers from the Malay Peninsula) name
odors as consistently as colors, and much better than English
speakers (Majid & Burenhult, 2014). In Jahai the linguistic
advantage for smells correlates with a cultural interest in
odors. Here we ask whether sub-cultures in the West with
odor expertise also show superior odor naming. We tested
wine and coffee experts (who have specialized odor training)
in an odor naming task. Both wine and coffee experts were no
more accurate or consistent than novices when naming odors.
Although there were small differences in naming strategies,
experts and non-experts alike relied overwhelmingly on
source-based descriptions. So the specific language experts
speak continues to constrain their ability to express odors.
This suggests expertise alone is not sufficient to overcome the
limits of language in the domain of smell.

Introduction
Strawberries, stop signs and fire trucks are red. It is easy to
name the common color property “red” irrespective of the
object it belongs to. In fact, many (if not all) languages have
dedicated or “basic” color terms to refer to hues regardless
of the object to which they belong (Berlin & Kay, 1969;
Kay, Berlin, Maffi, & Merrifield, 2009). That is, there is a
set of abstract terms which only refer to the quality of color
(e.g., blue, green, red). Color appears to be highly
“codable”, i.e., easy to express in language. Brown and
Lenneberg (1954) operationalized codability with a number
of parameters, aside from basic vocabulary. Descriptions for
codable colors are shorter (measured in number of syllables,
and number of words); are named faster; and people agree
on the names (there is consensus both across people and
within people across time).
In contrast to colors, odors do not appear to be codable.
Philosophers and scholars throughout history argue smell is
the least important sense (e.g. Darwin, 1871; Sperber,
1975/1974), and this appears to be reflected in language too.
People are generally very bad at naming smells. Ask two
people to name the same odor and they produce different
descriptions; in most cases referring to a source (e.g., fruit,
banana) or alternatively giving an evaluative response (e.g.,
gross, beautiful) (Lawless & Cain, 1975; Lawless, 1984;

483

Wiktorsson, 2009). Communicating about smells is also part
of the sub-culture of flavor expertise. Think for example of
a vinologist who explains to a customer why this particular
Bordeaux vintage, rather than the Beaujolais primeur the
customer had in mind, is better suited to a lamb stew. So the
question we ask is whether flavor experts in the West are
also good odor namers. Could the specialized training flavor
experts undergo make them better at naming smells than the
lay person?
The use of language by experts has received little
attention in this context. There are two separate issues: (1)
Are experts more consistent than non-experts in describing
smells? (2) Do experts differ from non-experts in the types
of strategy they use to describe smells? Previous studies
have not directly examined whether everyday odor naming
is different between experts and novices. The studies
suggest a rather mixed picture of experts’ linguistic abilities
for odors.
Some studies suggest experts might not be much better
than novices at odor naming. Lawless (1984) asked wine
experts and novices to describe different wines, and looked
at the content of their descriptions. He found wine
descriptions from both experts and novices were highly
idiosyncratic suggesting little systematicity in expert
responses. A whopping 82% of odor descriptions were
given by only one participant for each wine, indicating low
consistency across participants. However, Lawless did not
directly compare the two groups on consistency, so we
cannot know for sure whether experts and novices were
similar or different on this measure. In a different study
Parr, Heatherbell, and White (2002) asked wine experts and
matched novices to sniff and then name wine related odors
(instead of actual wine). Experts and novices correctly
identified the same number of odors, and were equally
consistent. However, a closer look at the data shows experts
had numerically higher identification and consistency rates
(even though these did not prove statistically different),
leaving open the possibility the study was underpowered (as
suggested by Parr et al. [2002, p.752] themselves).
In contrast to Lawless and Parr et al., Bende and Nordin
(1997) found experts named more odors correctly than
novices, suggesting experts were also more consistent. The
expert advantage has been found in director-matcher tasks
too. In this paradigm people are asked to match wines to
linguistic descriptions produced by experts and novices.
Expert descriptions led to more correct matches than novice
descriptions for the same wines (Solomon, 1990). This
suggests expert descriptions are more informative. Experts
are also better than novices at matching descriptions to
wines, particularly when the descriptions are given by other
experts (Lawless, 1984). Taken together these results
suggest flavor experts may indeed have an advantage for
naming odors.
In terms of the strategies experts use, some studies have
found wine experts use more concrete and specific words
(e.g. blackberries) (Lawless, 1984), or more precise
language overall (Zucco, Carassai, Baroni, & Stevenson,

2011). In contrast, when matching descriptions to wine,
Gawel (1997) found wine experts relied more on vague or
metaphorical terms (e.g. elegant, complex). In another
study, Sezille, Fournel, Rouby, Rinck, and Bensafi (2014)
compared naming in experts (perfumers, flavorists) and
non-experts (novices, trainee chefs). They found experts
used more technical terms (i.e., terms referring to chemical
substances (e.g. aldehyde), and made less reference to the
hedonic value (e.g. unpleasant).
The studies reviewed above focus mostly on odors
relevant to the specific expertise being considered, so it is
not clear if flavor expertise leads to a general advantage in
naming odors. Do the many years of experience change
wine experts’ ability to express odors in language? In this
study we compared a group of wine experts to non-experts
for their naming of simple everyday odors (such as
chocolate, leather, and lemon). We also included a separate
group of coffee experts. Coffee experts also undergo
extensive training of their noses and palates, but differ in
some interesting respects from wine experts. Whereas wines
are usually elaborately described in tasting notes, menus,
and on placards in stores, the descriptions of coffees tend to
be simpler. This is illustrated by the number of magazines
available to peruse on both topics; while there are 10
different subscription magazines to be found about wine on
Amazon.com, not a single subscription magazine for coffee
is available (retrieved on January 20th 2015). This suggests
wine experts have more experience in communicating about
odors than coffee experts, even though both have extensive
perceptual experience and training with smells and flavors.
We test three main hypotheses in this study. First, given
experts’ greater training and everyday attention to smells,
experts should be more consistent than novices in the
descriptions of smells. This might be especially true for
wine experts who have many opportunities to communicate
about smells. Second, experts should also be able to
correctly identify more smells than novices. Finally, experts
should differ in the precision of their descriptions for odors.
Based on the previous literature it is unclear what the
direction of this difference should be exactly, but we might
expect experts to differ both in the length of their
descriptions and the type of descriptions they give.

Methods
Participants
Sixty-three people (22 women, Mage = 43.7 years, SD =
11.7, age range: 24 – 70 years) participated in the
experiment. Twenty-two participants were wine experts, and
worked as qualified vinologists or sommeliers. Twenty
participants were coffee experts, and worked as qualified
baristas, coffee roasters or coffee brokers, and had a similar
amount of training and experience as the wine experts.
Another 21 participants were recruited as novice controls
and were matched for age and gender to both the wine and
coffee expert groups as closely as possible. All participants
were native or near-native speakers of Dutch.

beetje citrus ‘a little citrus’ was not coded because the
quality is “citrus”, and een beetje indicates only the strength
of the odor (or confidence of the participant). But rood fruit
‘red fruit’ was coded as a whole response including rood
‘red’, because “red fruit” has a different quality of smell
than “fruit” in general. Repeated responses (e.g. when a
person mentioned chocola twice for the same stimulus as in
the example above) were only counted once.
Consistency between speakers was calculated as in
Majid and Burenhult (2014) using Simpson’s Diversity
Index (Simpson, 1949), and was measured separately for
only first responses, and then all responses. That is, for each
stimulus item we calculated whether each participant in
each group agreed with one another in how they described
that item. Item scores were subjected to further analyses
(see Results). For accuracy, answers were coded as correct
when the participant identified the odor as classified by the
manufacturer of the stimuli. The total number of correct
responses was then calculated over participants and items.
Finally, we coded responses into three main categories
so we could test whether experts differed from novices in
the strategies they used: (1) Source terms, i.e. words
referring to an object or class of objects (e.g., chocola
‘chocolate’, fruitig ‘fruity’); (2) Evaluative terms, i.e. words
describing the hedonic evaluation of the stimulus (e.g.,
lekker ‘pleasant’, gadverdamme ‘disgusting’). Majid and
Burenhult (2014) identified a third category of abstract
terms. In Dutch this includes terms such as aromatisch
‘fragrant/aromatic’ and muf ‘musty’. Participants rarely used
this strategy but they did use other descriptions, such as
cross-modal metaphors (e.g., zoet ‘sweet’, groen ‘green’), or
reference to a general state (e.g., gekookt ‘cooked’). We
categorized these together with abstract odor terms as (3)
Non-source terms, i.e. words not referring directly to an
object.

To assess expertise, all participants completed a
questionnaire which tested their knowledge about wine
(following Hughson & Boakes, 2001; Lehrer, 1983), their
knowledge about coffee,1 and their general awareness of
odors in daily life (a shortened version of the questionnaire
by Smeets, Schifferstein, Boelema, & Lensvelt-Mulders,
2008). Separate ANOVAs on the three questionnaires
confirmed the wine experts have expertise in wine (and only
wine), the coffee experts in coffee (and only coffee), and the
novices in neither. Both wine and coffee experts showed
significantly higher odor awareness than the novices, but
they did not differ from each other in this respect.

Materials
Ten different odors were used in the odor naming task
presented using “Sniffin’ Sticks” (Hummel, Sekinger, Wolf,
Pauli, & Kobal, 1997). These are marker pens containing an
odorant (instead of ink) which the participant can smell by
removing the marker cap and smelling the tip. All odors
used in the experiment were common household scents, and
were familiar to people living in the Netherlands. The odors
can also be found in the descriptions of wine and coffee
(e.g. Noble et al., 1984). The odors were: chocolate, clove,
apple, lemon, cinnamon, garlic, mushroom, leather, grass,
rose.

Procedure
Each participant was tested individually in a neutral, well-lit
and well-ventilated room, kept at 20±2 degrees Celsius. The
entire procedure was carried out in Dutch. The participants
completed the questionnaires first, and then the odors were
presented in a fixed random order. Each participant was
instructed in Dutch: Wilt u de geur zo precies mogelijk
beschrijven (‘Can you describe the smell as precisely as
possible’). Answers were recorded using an audio-recorder,
and the descriptions were later transcribed and coded.

Results

Coding

We first examined the precision of responses across groups
by comparing the length of descriptions using one-way
ANOVAs (3 levels: wine expert, coffee expert, novices) by
participants (F1) and items (F2). There was a significant
main effect of group F1 (2, 56) = 11.8, p < 0.001, η² =
0.037, F2 (2, 27) = 5.812, p = 0.008, η² = 0.30. Planned
comparisons showed coffee experts (M = 102, SD =103)
gave significantly shorter descriptions than wine experts (M
= 146, SD = 125), p < 0.001, d = 0.38, and novices (M =
144, SD =127), p < 0.001, d = 0.36. The difference between
wine experts and novices was not significant. So, coffee
experts were more concise in their descriptions overall.
Our main question was whether experts are more
consistent when naming odors. A one-way ANOVA on
consistency scores across items showed no main effect of
group by first response F (2, 27) = 0.904, p = 0.417, η² =
0.063, or all responses F (2, 27) = 1.251, p = 0.302, η² =

First we measured the length of every description by
counting the number of characters in the fully transcribed
response.
We wished to examine whether experts and novices
agreed in their responses, and whether they correctly
identified the odors. In order to measure this, the main
responses from the fully transcribed descriptions were
identified. For example, a speaker said: Ruikt wel naar
chocola. Vanille of chocola een van de twee. Geen idee. i.e.,
‘Smells like chocolate. Vanilla or chocolate, one of the two.
No idea.’ From this description the main qualitative
descriptors chocola and vanille were coded. Modifiers and
hedges were ignored unless their exclusion changed the
quality description. For example, een beetje ‘a little’ in een

0.084.2 Experts were no more consistent for odor
descriptions than novices. Scores were in the same range for
all groups, and relatively low throughout (ranging from 0.07
to 0.12 where the maximum score indicating unanimity
would be 1.0; See Figure 1).

0.052. Compared to the other groups, coffee experts used
fewer non-source terms, z = -1.978, p < 0.05, and fewer
evaluative terms, z = -2.33, p < 0.05 (see Figure 1). So the
three groups differ in subtle ways in their overall strategy
for describing smells, but the dominant strategy (i.e.,
reliance on source descriptions) is the same for all.

Discussion
Wine and coffee experts were no more consistent than
novices when describing odors. In fact, overall consistency
for odor naming was low for both experts and novices, and
comparable to the English speakers reported by Majid and
Burenhult (2014). In addition, we found no difference
between groups in the number of correctly labeled odors.
Overall, experts and novices all overwhelmingly used
source-based descriptions. There were, however, small
differences in specific strategies. Coffee experts gave the
shortest descriptions, and used less evaluative terms and
non-source terms than wine experts or novices. Wine
experts used more non-source, or metaphorical, terms to
describe the odors, such as zoet ‘sweet’ and gekookt
‘cooked’, while novices used more evaluative descriptions,
such as lekker ‘pleasant’ and gadverdamme ‘disgusting’.
The odors used in this study represented everyday
smells. Nevertheless, experts and novices had problems
accurately naming them. This is in line with the results of
Parr and colleagues (2002), who found experts and novices
do not differ in their ability to name smells. Our study had
double the number of wine experts and novices as Parr et
al., (2002) and included an additional 20 coffee experts, so
the lack of an effect is unlikely due to insufficient power. In
fact, the wine experts show numerically lower consistency
than either coffee experts or novices. It is also unlikely the
absence of an effect was due to lack of expertise. All experts
in this study fulfilled the criteria for expertise (cf. Melcher
& Schooler, 1996; Parr et al., 2002): they were wine or
coffee professionals, earning money with their expertise.
We also independently verified the experts tested really did
have more knowledge of wines and coffees by means of
Expert Questionnaires. The results of the odor awareness
scale also showed experts differed from novices by showing
more awareness of odors in general; further confirming
odors play an important role for them in their daily lives.
Some previous studies have found an advantage of
expertise on odor naming. Bende and Nordin (1997) found
experts named more odors correctly than novices, but a
closer examination of the data shows the group differences
were driven by only a few odors in the sample. In a similar
vein, Zucco and colleagues (2011) found wine experts were
able to identify wine related odors with higher accuracy than
novices. However, this advantage did not generalize to
common household odors. Our results corroborate this
finding. Expert training in flavor does not give a general
advantage for naming smells. However, experts could very
well be better at naming and identifying specific smells,
particularly those relevant for their expertise. For example,
wine experts could be better at identifying odors specifically

Figure 1: The bar graph (top) illustrates overall consistency
(for first responses) was low for all groups and not
statistically different from each other (error bars represent
standard error). The pie charts (below) illustrate types of
descriptions. All three groups predominantly used source
terms (orange). In addition, wine experts used more nonsource terms (black), and novices more evaluative terms
(green).
We then examined whether experts correctly identified
the target odors more often by conducting one-way
ANOVAs again by participants (F1) and items (F2). There
was no difference between groups in the number of correct
responses F1 (2, 59) = 1.356, p = 0.266, η² = 0.044, F2 (2,
27) = 0.094, p = 0.910, η² = 0.007. Wine experts (M = 5, SD
= 2.3) and coffee experts (M = 6, SD = 4.2) were no better
than novices (M = 5, SD = 4.0) in identifying odors. Finally,
we examined the type of descriptions across groups using
chi-square. All groups overwhelmingly used source-based
terms (wine experts 70%; coffee experts 81%; novices
72%), but there was an overall effect of strategy by group,
χ2 (4, N = 1698) = 22.9, p < 0.01, Cramer’s V = 0.074. Wine
experts used more non-source terms (e.g., zoet ‘sweet’,
gekookt ‘cooked’), z = 2.18, p < 0.05, while novices used
more evaluative terms (e.g. lekker, i.e. ‘nice’), z = 1.94, p =
2

Separate participant analyses are not possible for the
consistency analyses because consistency is measured over
participants. The results were verified with the non-parametric
Kruskall-Wallis test, as the assumptions for a parametric test were
violated. The pattern of results is the same.

related to wine (e.g. smells related to barrel ageing) and
coffee experts for coffee-related smells (e.g. smells related
to the Maillard reaction). Although the smells used in this
study all occur in wine and coffee descriptions (e.g. Noble
et al., 1984), they are found elsewhere too and do not
require any special training. Another possibility is that
remains open is experts are more proficient in naming
smells and flavors of real substances from their domain of
expertise, i.e. wines and coffees. This requires further
testing.
Although there was no difference between the groups in
consistency, the groups did differ in subtle ways in the types
of responses they gave. The difference between the two
expert groups is a little surprising given previous research.
Sezille and colleagues (2014) asked flavorists, perfumers,
trainee cooks and novices to describe different odors. They
showed a general tendency for novices to use more
evaluative terms (as we also found in this study), but no
differences between expert groups. In our study, both expert
groups reported the same level of awareness of odors, so it
is unlikely the difference in naming resides there. Instead,
we suggest the variation comes from differences in
evaluating the flavor of wines versus coffees.
The differences in odor naming strategies in different
flavor domains have not been compared directly, but there
are some intriguing observations in the literature. Wine
experts often describe wine in a structured way (cf. Lehrer,
1983), first evaluating the color (visually), then the aroma
and bouquet by smelling the wine (i.e. orthonasal olfaction),
and then the various taste aspects of the wine (i.e. gustation,
mouthfeel, retronasal olfaction and finish). The terms used
in these various steps, however, are not strictly defined (e.g.
Brochet & Dubourdieu, 2001; Lehrer, 1983). Wine experts
appear to integrate smell, texture, and taste into more
synaesthetic language (cf. Caballero, 2007; Paradis & EegOlofsson, 2013). This is evident in their use of more nonsource terms for the smells in this experiment as well. When
describing coffees, on the other hand, coffee experts
describe smell with source descriptors, and taste with a
small set of abstract taste terms. The perfect coffee has the
right balance between sweet, bitter and sour (cf. Hayakawa
et al., 2010). The present study suggests a closer look at the
different strategies specific groups of flavor experts use to
describe odors could be fruitful to explore further.
How well do the current findings mesh with the idea that
the senses are differentially ineffable (Majid & Burenhult,
2014; Majid & Levinson, 2011)? According to Levinson
and Majid (2014), expert interest in smell could overcome
the relative ineffability of the sense of smell in a given
language. In contrast to the language of the Jahai, Dutch
(like English) has very few dedicated words for odors. The
experts in this study had years of training and experience,
but even with this experience, wine and coffee experts were
restricted by the limitations of their language. Why is this
so?
One possibility suggested by the earlier discussion is the
specific expertise we investigated. Although flavor expertise

relies on odor knowledge, flavor is far more than odor
alone. Perhaps focusing on dedicated odor experts, such as
perfumers or incense makers, would be better. A different
possibility for the poor odor naming by wine and coffee
experts is the delayed acquisition of their expertise. The
Jahai learn their smell lexicon in the course of normal
language acquisition: as children. The Dutch experts, on the
other hand, only come to acquire their expertise in odors and
flavors late in life and long after any critical period for
language learning. It could be the late development of odor
expertise puts restrictions on the ability to learn odor
language by flavor experts. These possibilities require
further exploration.
To conclude, the present study indicates the resources
within a specific language can restrict the codability of a
perceptual sense, and selective experience and training is
not enough to overcome these restrictions. This suggests the
specific language we speak puts constraints on how we
communicate and make sense of the world.
