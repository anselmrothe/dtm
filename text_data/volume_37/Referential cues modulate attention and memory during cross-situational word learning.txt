participants who were not reliably using the gaze cue on ex-
posure trials. This filter removed 90 participants who selected
the target of eye gaze at below chance levels on exposure tri-
als. The analysis of the filtered dataset showed a reliable in-
teraction between trial type and gaze condition (β = −0.79,
p < .05), suggesting that when learners used the gaze cue,
they were less likely to track multiple word-object links.
   Taken together, the response time and accuracy analyses
provide evidence that learners use of a referential cue mod-
ulated their attention during learning, thus making them less
likely to track multiple word-object links. Interestingly, we
did not see strong evidence that reduced tracking of alterna-
tives resulted in a boost to participants’ performance on same
trials. This finding suggests that the limitations on same tri-
als may be different than those regulating the distribution of
attention on switch trials, since the presence of a referential       Figure 3: Accuracy on test trials in Experiment 2. Each dat-
