                               Abstract
   People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to detect lo-
   cal patterns of visual stimuli more quickly than global patterns,
   which is opposite to the behavior of typically developing peo-
   ple. We hypothesized that the imbalance between excitation
   and inhibition neurons in the visual cortex causes the local pro-
   cessing bias observed in ASD. Stronger inhibitory connections
   could diminish the neural activities and thus prevent global fea-
   ture integration, whereas properly balanced connections would
   enable the cortex to detect features of any size. We verified
   our hypothesis by employing a computational neural network
   called a neocognitron. Our experimental results demonstrated
   that the network with stronger inhibitory connections exhib-
   ited a local processing bias, whereas the network with properly
   adjusted connections showed a moderate global bias. More-
   over, the networks with extremely strong or weak inhibitions
   revealed no perception bias. These results suggest that an ex-         Figure 1: Evaluation of local processing bias in ASD. The left

tex causes a local processing bias in ASD. Previous studies
have reported an atypical excitation/inhibition balance (E/I
balance) and relevant gamma-band activity in ASD (Sun et
al., 2012; Snijders, Milivojevic, & Kemner, 2013). Further-
more, the association between the E/I imbalance and social
dysfunction was demonstrated in a mouse experiment (Yizhar
et al., 2011). Based on this evidence, we consider that the
E/I balance might influence the integration of spatial infor-
mation. For example, stronger inhibitory connections could
diminish the response of succeeding neurons and thus hinder
global feature integration. We verify our hypothesis by em-
ploying a computational neural network called a neocogni-
tron (Fukushima & Miyake, 1982; Fukushima, 1988, 2003).

 Neocognitron: A Hierarchical Neural Network
                 for Pattern Recognition
We introduce a neocognitron (Fukushima & Miyake, 1982;
Fukushima, 1988, 2003) as the basis of our computational
model. The neocognitron is a hierarchical, multilayered neu-
ral network, which is capable of robust visual pattern recog-
nition. Figure 2 (a) shows the typical architecture of the net-
work. Inspired by the structure of the primary visual cortex,
the network consists of multiple layers: U0 is the input layer
that receives visual stimuli, UG is the contrast-extraction layer
that detects the edge features of the input, and US1 to UC5 are
the layers that recognize the patterns presented in the input.                     (b) Connections between US and UC layers
Visual stimuli fed into the network are processed through re-
ceptive fields (denoted by circles in Figure 2 (a)), which cover                            Figure 2: Neocognitron

S-cells yields an output. C-cells thus spatially blur the re-
sponses of S-cells and make the network robust against posi-
tion errors in visual stimuli. The mechanism of the neocogni-
tron is described in greater detail in Fukushima and Miyake
(1982) and Fukushima (1988, 2003).
               Influence of E/I Balance on
        Local/Global Information Processing
We hypothesize that the E/I balance influences the lo-                (a) Proper inhibitory connections maintain both local and global

illustrates how the relative strength of the inhibitory connec-
tions bSl from V-cells affects the output of S-cells uSl in the
neocognitron: (a) proper inhibitory connections, (b) stronger
inhibitory connections, and (c) weaker inhibitory connec-
tions. We suppose that the neocognitron has been trained with
visual stimuli, each of which contains a single number but
with various types, sizes, and positions. The network is then
presented with hierarchically compound numbers, as shown
in the leftmost of Figure 3 (a), where multiple small number
“3”s form a large number “2” according to their close posi-
tioning.                                                                          (b) Stronger inhibitory connections ex-

   If the network has properly adjusted connections, it should
be able to detect the numbers presented in the input image
regardless of their sizes and positions. As illustrated in the
rightmost image of Figure 3 (a), the output of S-cells, which
receive proper inhibitory connections from V-cells, maintains
the features of both “3” and “2” as the integration of multi-
ple “3”s. The extracted features then enable the network to
recognize both the local and global patterns in the succeed-
ing layers. In contrast, stronger or weaker inhibitory connec-
tions cause local or global processing bias in the recognition.
If inhibitory neurons have stronger connections, as shown in                     (c) Weaker inhibitory connections empha-

this scenario, only the local number “3” becomes visible, but

of S-cells. On the other hand, weaker inhibitory connections
produce the opposite effect. Figure 3 (c) depicts how weaker
inhibitions enhance the responses of S-cells and therefore di-      to the stimuli. Our computational model thus reveals the un-

the global numbers more strongly than the local numbers. In
contrast, higher ∆u values for the local numbers demonstrated
the local processing bias in ASD. Inhibitory connections en-
hanced by α = 1.1 to 1.4 forced the network to extract the
local features more strongly than the global ones, which gen-
erated an ASD-like bias toward the local information.
   Moreover, our results suggest that our computational
model with a variable E/I balance can reproduce multiple
types of ASD symptoms. ASD is characterized by both hy-
poesthesia as well as hyperesthesia in sensory perception. As
mentioned above, hyperesthesia might be related to a local
processing bias, whereas hypoesthesia might be linked to a
super-global or no processing bias. When α = 0.5 to 0.7,
the neocognitron did not show any bias toward the local or
global patterns. Indeed, the network could recognize neither
the local nor global numbers. This inability to recognize the
patterns also appeared when α > 1.4. These results indicate
that hypoesthesia in ASD shares a common neural mecha-
nism with hyperesthesia, and that a change in the E/I balance
                                                                             (a) Response of the whole network when α = 1.0

Internal Representation of the Neocognitron
Acquired through Learning
Next, we analyzed the internal representation of the neocog-
nitron to investigate the effect of the E/I balance on the net-
work structure. Figure 6 presents the responses of (a) the
whole network when α = 1.0 and of (b) only UC4 when α =
0.5, 1.0, and 1.2. In this example, the compound numbers
“3” (local) and “2” (global) were given as the input to the
network.
   Figure 6 (a) first demonstrates the hierarchical feature in-
tegration acquired in the network, which is a basic function
of the neocognitron. Local lines in particular orientations
were detected in UC1 , while more global patterns such as cor-
ners and longer lines were extracted in UC2 and UC3 . The                     (b) Response of UC4 when α = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.2

both the local and global features. The top three cell planes
(denoted by squares) in UC4 showed wider activation in the          Figure 6: Internal representation of the neocognitron after

As described above, the neocognitron with a proper E/I bal-
