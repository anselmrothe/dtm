   For children assigned to the no compare-no function
condition, the experimenter began each trial by presenting a
single exemplar (e.g., a penny) and exclaiming, “Look at this
one! Do you see this one?” The experimenter then placed the
two choice alternatives—the shape and taxonomic match—
directly below the exemplar, as shown in Figure 1A, and
asked the child, “Which one of these is the same kind of thing
as this one?” After the child selected either the shape or
taxonomic match, the experimenter removed the pictures and
administered the next trial until all 10 trials were complete.
Which exemplar was presented in each set was
counterbalanced across children, and the left-right placement
of the shape and taxonomic matches was randomized across
trials.
   The procedure for the no compare-function condition was
identical to that in the no compare-no function condition with
the exception that the experimenter also provided a functional
description with the exemplar. For example, as illustrated in
Figure 1B, the experimenter said, “Look at this one! Do you
see this one? You put it in a piggy bank.” following the
presentation of the penny.
   In the compare-no function condition, the experimenter
presented the child with both exemplars (e.g., a penny and a
