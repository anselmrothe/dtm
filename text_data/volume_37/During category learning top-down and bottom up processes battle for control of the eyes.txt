Abstract
Information in the visual environment is largely accessed
through a series of fixations punctuated by saccades. Changes
in fixation patterns in response to learning are well
documented in studies of categorization, but the properties of
the saccades that precede them and the role of visual salience
in effecting eye movements remains poorly understood. This
eye tracking study examines oculomotor changes in a
categorization task with salient distractors. The design
examines high-level, goal-directed attention that serves the
purpose of learning, and making decisions based on that
learned knowledge in the presence of salient distractors. We
find that salient distractors draw fixation durations and
saccade velocities that display similar properties to eye
movements directed to task relevant items, challenging
existing accounts that salience draws rapid saccades.

Vision is critical for many life forms. Input processed by the
visual system can be used to interact with an organism’s
surroundings, informing what dangers might be present or,
depending on the animal in question, whether there is a
coffee shop ahead. The relative contribution of exogenous
salience and observers’ goals in driving the eye movements
that gate input to the visual system remains contested. Eye
movements are closely linked to attention, which is thought
to be captured by salient items (Theeuwes, 2004; 2010).
However, the goals of the observer can override capture
(Leber & Egeth, 2006). Understanding the impact of
salience is further complicated by an apparently disparate
influence of stimulus properties (e.g. colour vs. shading)
reported to influence visual search performance, implicating
the physical manifestation of salient items as a factor in
explorations of salience and attention (Wolfe & Horowitz,
2004). The present study explores the influence of salient
distractors on attention during learning. Understanding how
visual information is obtained and subsequently processed is
important to understanding cognition more broadly.
When viewing a static scene, eyes are usually either
resting on a stimulus (a fixation) or moving to a new
location (a saccade). Little visual input is processed during
saccades (Higgins & Rayner, 2014; Matin, 1974) so
fixations play a particularly important role in visual
processing.
The locations of fixations are determined in part by low
level properties of the objects in the scene. Areas of rich

color, high brightness, or high contrast are salient, and thus
get fixated more often (Parkhurst, Law & Nieber, 2002)
These findings have been incorporated into algorithms (e.g.
Itti, Koch & Nieber, 1998) which calculate salience across a
scene based on properties such as colour, intensity and
orientation, and have been shown to predict fixations (Judd,
Ehinger, Durand & Torralba, 2009; Ouerhani, von Wartburg,
Hügli & Müri, 2004). Although salience is an important
factor in predicting where fixations occur, it is not the whole
story (Tatler, Hayhoe, Land & Ballard, 2011).
Fixations can also be influenced by the task at hand.
Yarbus (1967) showed that participants freely viewing a
painting displayed a fixation pattern that differed from
fixation patterns to the same images with instructions to
look for particular information in the environment by
instructions such as “estimate the material circumstance of
the family [in the painting]”. Another study showed that
when participants were asked to find a subset of a target
image, much like placing a piece in a mostly completed
puzzle, they used the information from the subset to guide
their search (Pomplun, 2006). The flexibility of the visual
system to seek information in support of task objectives
shows that goal-directed attention is also an important
contributor in propelling oculomotor activity.
For example, when eye movements are recorded during a
naturalistic task like making tea, fixations tend to precede
larger motor movements such as reaching (Land, Mennie &
Rusted, 1999) and during driving, better drivers display
different eye movement patterns than novices (Underwood,
Chapman, Brocklehurst, Underwood & Crundall, 2014).
These findings link the global task property of expertise and
task knowledge to the low level execution of eye
movements. Since fixations are required to extract and
subsequently process richer information, tasks can be
designed to purposely enact demands on the visual system
such that researchers may infer what parts of the
environment are prioritized by the participant.
The changing patterns of fixations during learning are
informative about what the participant knows, and the stage
of knowledge they are in as the efficiency of information
access increases. For instance, in a category learning task
where spatially separated cues have different diagnostic
value, fixations uninformative to making a category
decision decline in duration and frequency relative to
informative cues as learning progresses (Blair, Watson &
Meier, 2009). Category learning has been an effective

about the visual environment and accessing information.
Examining both the fixation and the saccade is a step toward
developing a fuller understanding of the visual system in the
context of learning.

source of uncovering when, and inferring why fixation
patterns change (Blair, Watson, Walshe & Maj, 2009;
McColeman, Barnes, Chen, Meier, Walshe & Blair, 2014;
Rehder & Hoffman, 2005), but fixations are only one
element of oculomotor activity.
Saccades, too, are influenced by a number of features of
the task environment. For example, participants in an antisaccade task are asked to fixate away from the location of a
visual cue, the reverse of a pro-saccade task where
participants fixate toward the location of a visual cue. Thus,
a cue might appear in the mirror location of where the
participant is asked to fixate. Researchers have found that
saccades directed to the cue in the pro saccade task are
faster than saccades directed to the mirror location opposite
the cue in the anti-saccade task (Fischer & Weber, 1992) and
erroneous eye movements - moving toward the cue in the
anti-saccade task, for example - are executed more quickly
(Tatler & Hutton, 2007). In a similar vein, stimulus-driven
saccades are faster than goal-directed ones (van Zoest &
Donk, 2007). Still other research suggests that saccades to
salient distracting items are faster (as measured by shorter
latency) than saccades directed to a target in a search array
(van Zoest, Donk & Theeuwes, 2004). These studies look at
eye-movements in simple tasks wherein the goal of the
participant remains constant and so the responsiveness of
these effects to changing task knowledge remains unknown.
The present study aims to explore the role of salient
versus non-salient features when they serve as distractors in
a learning task, effectually pitting bottom-up attention and
top-down attention against each other. The experimental
task is category learning: participants learn about the
relevance of different features for making a category
response through trial and error. The experiment design
allows for insight as to how the role of bottom-up attention
changes over time, and points during learning wherein topdown attention takes precedence over stimulus-driven
attentional capture. As with earlier work in categorization,
eye movements are used as an index of attention patterns.
The fixations and the saccades are both of interest here, in

Participants were asked to sort images of sham alien cells
into four possible categories. The information necessary for
making the category choice is communicated by features
that vary trial-to-trial (Figure 1) and are described to the
participants as organelles of the alien cells during the
instructions which ask them to sort the images into
categories.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three
conditions: One Salient Distractor (n=77), Two Salient
Distractor (n=68) and Baseline without salient distractors
(n=65). All participants in the study received partial course
credit from the Simon Fraser University Research
Participation Pool. Those who failed to complete the 320
trials in the task are excluded from analysis (20 from
Baseline, 23 from Two Salient Distractor and 22 from One
Salient Distractor conditions respectively). Of primary
interest is in how salient distractors affect ocular-motor
measures as participants learn, so we restrict our analysis to
participants who achieved 16 correct trials in a row. Twentyfive participants from the Baseline Condition, 20 from the
Two Salient Distractor Condition and 22 from the One
Distractor Condition were excluded. The remaining
participants all met a pre-specified gaze criterion of >70%
of trials with >75% gaze data collected.

Stimuli and Category Structure
The features can take on one of two possible values
during each trial and are pasted on a random selection of
rotations of the alien cell background (Figure 1). For any
one participant, features are pasted to the same location
trial-by-trial, and the location of the features is randomly
assigned to four possible locations between participants.
Each feature subtends approximately 1.15° and is separated
by 12.4°. The combination of Features 1 and 2 is sufficient
to correctly respond with a category label on all trials (Table
1), and thus Features 1 and 2 are considered relevant.
Participants learn through trial and error which are relevant
features and the combination of feature values that
correspond to the four category labels.

Procedure
Participants’ eye movements are recorded using a deskmounted Tobii X120 eye tracker sampling with a temporal
resolution of 120Hz and a spatial resolution of .5° of visual
angle. Fixations are calculated using the raw gaze data and a
modified version of Salvucci and Goldberg’s dispersion
threshold algorithm (2000) with a temporal threshold of
75ms and a spatial threshold of 1.1° such that a fixation is a
minimum of 75ms long and consists of gaze points within

1.1°. Saccade duration is the difference between the end of
the first fixation and the start of a second fixation. Distance
is the Euclidian metric between the mathematical spatial
mean (centre) of the first and second fixations. The mean
saccade velocity is saccade distance divided by duration.

Results
At the level of overt response, there is no influence of the
number of salient distractors as reflected by accuracy,
reaction time or the probability of fixating irrelevant
information. That is, participants are able to perform the
task and are unaffected by salient distractors at this level of
analysis. Accuracy data were binned into blocks, where one
block is the average of 20 trials. Condition is a between
subjects effect, defined by the number of salient distractors
(0, 2 or 1 salient distractors). There is a main effect of Block
in the accuracy (Figure 2) indicated by an ANOVA
(F15,1140=132.54, p<.0001, Greenhouse-Geisser correction)
and no noticeable effect of Condition (F2,75=.38, p=.68) or
the interaction between Condition and Block (F30,1125=1.07,
p=.36). Accuracy clearly improves over learning, and is not
noticeably influenced by the number of salient distractors.
To see if the number of salient distractors effected how
quickly people decided to make their category response, an
ANOVA was conducted on reaction time, using Condition
and Block as above. There is no main effect of Condition
(F2,97=.027, p=.97) or interaction between Block and
Condition (F30,1455=.527, p=.988), but there is a main effect
of Block (F15,1455=47.578, p<.0001) indicating that response
times are faster as the experiment progresses.
The probability of fixating an irrelevant feature measure
acts as a coarse descriptor of the oculomotor efficiency
during a trial by capturing whether a participant is accessing
irrelevant information (Figure 2). As learning progresses
and the participant is aware of which of the features in the
stimulus are important to making a category decision, it is
unnecessary to fixate irrelevant items to extract information
from them. In this experiment’s particular design, with two
irrelevant features (Table 1), it is possible to look at half of
the irrelevant features during a trial. For this reason, it is

possible to obtain a score of .5 on this measure on a trial by
looking at only one of the two irrelevant items.
Again, an ANOVA is conducted with Condition and
Block as factors to investigate their influence on the
probability of fixating irrelevant features and there is a main
effect of Block (F15,1125=109.96, p<.0001, GreenhouseGeisser correction) finding no noticeable effect of Condition
(F2,75=.04, p=.91) or interaction between Condition and
Block (F30,1125=.75, p=.84). That is, in none of the three
conditions were participants more likely to look at the
irrelevant features during learning. Overall, there is no
distinguishable performance difference between the three
groups. Accuracy, reaction times, and the probability of
fixating irrelevant information all show a similar change
over learning where there is no detectable effect of
condition. This result is consistent with work that suggests
that task goals can eliminate salience effects (Tatler,
Hayhoe, Land & Ballard, 2011). Still, salience may yet
influence more basic ocular motor measures.
To investigate this, the overall dwell time on the four
features is reported as the fixation duration (Figure 3) and is
meant to uncover how much fixation time is allocated to the
four features of interest. That is, if there are four fixations to
feature 3 in a trial, then this measure reports the sum of the
durations of those four fixations. To uncover the relative
role of repeated exposures to stimuli on a trial-by-trial basis,
the fixation duration is estimated using a linear mixed
effects model built with trial, feature relevance and their
interactions as possible predictors. Estimates of the
predictiveness of feature relevance use Feature 1 as a
reference category.
In the baseline condition (Figure 3A), with no particularly
salient items, there were main effects of Feature 3 and 4
(β<-28, ps≦.00002). There is also an interaction between
Trial and Feature 3 (β=-.2351, p=.00024) while the
remaining factors play no discernible role in motivating the
fixation duration. Generally, then, there were decreased
fixation durations to irrelevant items relative to Features 1
and 2.

there were main effects of Features 2, 3, and 4 (βs<-31, ps<.

Trial and Feature 2 (β=-.18426, p=.00024) and Trial and
Feature 3 (β=-.1743, p=.00017) with the remaining
predictors having minor significance in affecting fixation
duration as predicted by the model. Here again, irrelevant
items were fixated less overall.
In the condition with a single salient distractor, Feature 4
is coded as the salient feature. There is a main effect of
Feature 3 (β=14.778, p=.0132), Trial (β=-.1367, p<.0001),
and an interaction between Trial and Feature 2 (β=.0716,
p=.0190) while the remaining predictors do not play a
significant role in predicting fixation duration. In all three
conditions, less time is spent fixating irrelevant information.
A second series of models was constructed to explore the
role of feature salience among other factors of interest in
predicting saccade velocities. The data subject to analysis
are eye movements directed to four features, and so
fixations that terminate elsewhere are excluded from the
dataset prior to analysis. That is, a saccade that begins in the
centre of the screen and ends with a fixation to Feature 1 is
viable, while a fixation beginning on Feature 1 and moving
to the centre of the screen is excluded. All saccades included
in this analysis end with fixations that are described above,
such that the overall number of saccades decreased over the
course of the experiment.
In these models, saccade velocity is predicted by trial
number, feature relevance, and the distance of the saccade
subjected to a logarithm transform to meet assumptions of
the model. Trial number captures the change in saccade
velocities over time, feature relevance indicates the role of
the individual features in predicting saccade velocity and
also captures the influence of salience, since salient
distractors are always irrelevant when they are present in
this experiment design. The distance of the saccade in
degrees of visual angle is reported as well, since the distance
of saccades is known to play an important role in the
characteristics of saccades (Baloh, Konrad, Sills &
Honrubia, 1975).
In the baseline condition where there are no particularly
salient distractors (Figure 4A), Distance was the best
predictor of saccade velocity (β=.8038, p<.0001) and Trial
is also a strong predictor (βTrial=-.0003, p<.0001). Feature 3

shows a main effect (β=-.05689, p=.0092) and the
interaction between Trial and Feature 3 is significant (β=.
0009, p=.0002). The interaction between Trial and Distance
is notable (β=.0001, p=.00002) as is the interaction between
Feature 2 and Distance (β=-.0300, p=.00089). The threeway interactions between each of Features 3 and 4 with
Distance and Trial (βs>-.0003, ps≦.0068) are also
significant predictors. The model reflects a complicated,
interacting relationship between the progress in the
experiment, feature relevance and distance. Saccades
spanning a larger distance are faster, as are saccades to
irrelevant features.
In the two salient distractors condition, features 3 and 4
are both irrelevant and salient (Figure 4B). There is an effect
of Distance (β=.8522, p<.0001) and Trial (β=-.0002, p=.
0048). The interaction between Distance and Trial is
predictive (β=.00015, p=.00001). The interaction between
Feature 2 and Distance is a minor but notable contributor
(β=-.0213, p=.0161). This condition reflects little by way
different effects for the four features, in that the saccade
velocities are similar regardless of feature relevance - and,
indirectly, feature salience.
Saccade velocities from participants in the single salient
distractor condition (Figure 4C) are analyzed using the same
model format as above. In this condition, the single salient
distractor is called Feature 4, but is as equally irrelevant to
completing the task as Feature 3 (Table 1). Here again,
distance is best predicted by distance (β=.8550, p<.0001)
where longer saccades correspond with a higher velocity.
There is also a main effect of trial number (β=-.0002, p=.
0106), and Feature 3 (β=-.0815, p=.0001). The interaction
between Trial and Feature 3 (β=.0004, p=.0027), and the
interaction between Feature 2 and distance (β=-.030, p=.
0014) are both significant, while the remaining predictors
having minor significance in affecting saccade velocity.
Failure to find a main effect of- or interactions involving
Feature 4 (the salient item) here is attributed to high
variability in the saccade velocity data for eye movements
directed to it.
Analyses reflect a clear difference in saccade velocities
between relevant and irrelevant items in the baseline
condition where there are no salient distractors. This is not
so in the presence of salient distractors, reflecting a

Discussion
This study pits high-level, goal directed attention against
bottom-up attention by manipulating the salience of
irrelevant features. We find that task relevance takes
precedence insofar as information seeking and responselevel efficiency is concerned: participants are no more likely
to look at irrelevant information in the presence of salient
distractors and regardless of the number of salient
distractors, overall accuracy and reaction times improve at
the same rate over the course of the experiment. Salience
does, however, affect the lower level properties of eye
movements by way of saccade velocity and, to a lesser
extent, fixation duration.
By beginning to uncover properties of both the fixation
and the saccade together, we are moving toward a fuller
understanding of oculomotor changes in response to
learning. The fixation, thought to be more closely related to
cognitive processing, is analyzed through the probability of
fixating irrelevant information (Figure 2) and the fixation
durations (Figure 3). Participants made fewer fixations to
the irrelevant features, regardless of whether those features
were salient. Relevant items are typically fixated longer,
although to a lesser extent when the irrelevant items were
salient.
Generally, the eyes travel to relevant, informative features
more slowly than they do to irrelevant distractors as is
indicated by the saccade velocity. This is evident as learning
progresses: the eyes travel to irrelevant items more quickly,
reflecting a responsiveness of low-level oculomotor activity
to shifts in high level cognitive changes, since eye
movements to the irrelevant features are comparatively fast
as learning progresses. The increase in saccade speed to
irrelevant features is especially true in the baseline condition
(Figure 4A), where the distractors are of similar salience to
the relevant features. When there are two salient distractors
(Figure 4B), the velocities directed to irrelevant items differ
less - it’s not that the velocities to relevant features are
slower in this case relative to saccade speeds in the baseline
condition as much as it’s due to decreased saccade velocities
to the irrelevant items in the condition where those
irrelevant items are salient. The condition with a single
distractor is particularly noteworthy in that one irrelevant

feature is salient and one irrelevant feature is not, and the
saccade velocities to each differ as a function of the
irrelevant items’ salience (Figure 4C).
The rapidity of saccades is clearly affected by both
salience and learned task relevance, and surprisingly the
direction of the influence of salience is opposite what
existing reports suggest: salient items draw slower saccades
than less salient items of equal task importance. Other work
investigating the role of salience in saccade velocities
suggests that goal-directed eye movements are typically
slower than stimulus-driven (or salience responsive) eye
movements (van Zoest, Donk & Theeuwes, 2004; XuWilson, Zee & Shadmehr, 2009). When the saccade itself is
rewarded, an interesting divergence in contributing factors
can be noted. Slow, long latency saccades are attributed to
rewarded saccades and faster, short latency saccades are
linked to salience (Schütz, Trommershäuser, Gegenfurtner,
2012).
These results may seem incongruent with previous work.
A possible factor in mediating eye movements such that
purposeful saccades travel more slowly is volition. Our data
can align well with earlier reports. Considering work in
visual search environments, where search is informed by
visual properties of prior interest to the observer (Wolfe,
1989), the three conditions can be interpreted as three
different types of search environments. In the baseline
condition, there is not a clear exclusion property in the same
way that there is when there are two salient distractors; in
the latter condition the participant may use luminosity to
exclude two of the features from contention as a target for
the next saccade. That is, reflexive, loosely controlled
saccades may be less likely when there is a filter or
conjunction search influencing viable regions of interest for
subsequent fixations. If this is the case, then saccades made
to these salient distractors are more likely to be volitional.
Alternatively, the salient distractors may simply be
interesting in their own right due to their conspicuity and
not fitting in with the rest of environment, which also
increases the likelihood of volitional saccades relative to
reflexive saccades directed to salient targets.
Exploring the relative influence of goal-directed and
stimulus-driven attention during learning is uniquely
informative in that goal-directedness develops over repeated
exposure to stimuli. Through changes over time it’s possible
to see the dynamic relationship between oculomotor activity
and higher level performance such as response accuracy. In

1563

this task, the influence of salient items is not clear until
some degree of category mastery is achieved in that the
three conditions show similar saccade velocities to all four
features until the 7th Block (approximately 140 trials). This
suggests that achieving the goal of the task - learning the
category structure - is imperative for participants and
generally, that high level goals can drastically affect low
level motor execution.
The main contributions of this work are threefold. We
gather additional insight into the role of salience in highlevel, cognitive task performance, adding to the knowledge
base of bottom-up versus top-down attention with data that
challenge basic assumptions of the primacy of bottom-up
attention in driving saccades. Methodologically, exploring
purposeful manipulations of the environment’s properties
over learning provides a foundation for insight into how
developing top-down knowledge dynamically responds to
task-irrelevant properties of the domain. Finally, exploring
the profile of a saccade in a high level task of this nature is
also novel, since most work - at least in category learning focuses on the fixations to probe attentional changes in the
task. Moving forward, designs of this nature are valuable for
informing how the cognitive system uses information in the
environment, and cases in which the properties of the
environment might help or hinder an agent’s ability to most
effectively use the information available in its surroundings.
