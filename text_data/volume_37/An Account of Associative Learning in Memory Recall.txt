Figure 1. A sample associative structure, including
associative strengths, after three items of a list have been
viewed. Of note is that association strengths weaken as items
become farther removed in time, as well as the asymmetric
structure of the associations. Note that, for clarity, we omit
here associations not relevant to our discussion.
With respect to parameters, all ACT-R/E parameters were set
at their default values. The three associative learning
parameters (learning rate, interference rate, and residual
activation decay rate; see Thomson, Lebiere, & Bennati,
2014) were set to represent a fairly moderate pace of
associative learning (set at 1.5, .25, and .5, respectively).
Note that these parameters were the same for both the serial
and recall tasks and, thus, for all three conditions of the
experiment we are modeling.
