Procedure Participants completed the study online. On the
first page of the website hosting the study, the participants
were presented with an introductory screen outlining the
broad aim and methodology of the study. Participants were
informed that any answers that they provided would be
completely anonymous and that they were free to withdraw
from participation at any point, and were then asked for
their consent to take part in the experiment. Once the
participants had given this, they were taken to the first of
twenty dilemmas.
  In each dilemma, participants were presented with one of
five moral dilemmas based upon a selection of those found
in Greene et al. (2001); the trolley problem, the footbridge
problem, the “fumes” problem (in which a hospital
