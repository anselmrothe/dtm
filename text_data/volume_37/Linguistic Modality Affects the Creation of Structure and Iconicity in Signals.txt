the signal space that participants use to generate signals, and
the meaning space which participants describe using their sig-
nals. In manipulating both, we affect the mapping between
the two in different ways. We manipulate the dimensionality
of both signal and meaning spaces, generating a dimension-
ality mismatch, which creates a mapping problem. Affecting
the dimensionality of our signal space is a very simple way to
model the differences between different linguistic modalities
with different levels of dimensionality. Obviously, modalities
for natural languages have a lot more dimensions than we use
in this study, but as with any model, in order to isolate individ-
ual effects, simplicity is key. We also manipulate the meaning         Figure 1: The meaning spaces used in phases 1:2 and 2:2 in

ers, e.g. a blue square is more similar to another blue square
with a different texture, than it is to a green square with a
different texture. We try to exploit this to generalise our no-
tion of iconicity to the discrete cases, as well as making it
algorithmic.
   To measure iconicity within our results, we used Viterbi
paths from the HMMs to reduce signals to a discrete sequence
of states. This is an analogue of reducing a continuous speech
signal of an uttered word to the string of phonemes which un-
derlies it. A pair-wise distance matrix was then generated
for the signal repertoire using Levenshtein distances between
their Viterbi paths, representing how different each signal is
in terms of number of “phoneme” changes necessary to get
from one to the other. Then, the meanings were put into a
pair-wise distance matrix with one another, to get a compara-
