Abstract
From an early age, people exhibit strong links between certain
visual (e.g. size) and acoustic (e.g. duration) dimensions. Do
people instinctively extend these crossmodal correspondences
to vocalization? We examine the ability of congenitally deaf
Chinese children and young adults (age M = 12.4 years, SD =
3.7 years) to generate iconic vocalizations to distinguish items
with contrasting magnitude (e.g., big vs. small ball). Both
deaf and hearing (M = 10.1 years, SD = 0.83 years)
participants produced longer, louder vocalizations for greater
magnitude items. However, only hearing participants used
pitch—higher pitch for greater magnitude – which counters
the hypothesized, innate size “frequency code”, but fits with
Mandarin language and culture. Thus our results show that
the translation of visible magnitude into the duration and
intensity of vocalization transcends auditory experience,
whereas the use of pitch appears more malleable to linguistic
and cultural influence.

Introduction
People tend to link certain auditory dimensions to certain
visual dimensions (Spence, 2011). For example, they
associate loudness with size and brightness (a loud sound is
big and bright), pitch with size and elevation (a high pitched
sound is small and high), and the temporal duration of a
sound with length (a temporally extended sound is long)1. A
large body of evidence indicates that some of these crossmodal correspondences are highly robust, especially those
involving prothetic dimensions that can be characterized in
terms of more or less magnitude, such as loudness, quantity
size, and duration (Walsh, 2003). These correspondences
are detectable early in development, and can influence lowlevel perceptual processes, as well as high-level processes
like the use of linguistic metaphor (Winter, Marghetis, &
Matlock, 2014). In this study, we examine whether certain
cross-modal correspondences between sight and sound also
extend to the production of iconic vocalizations. Do people

Dimensions like size and elevation may be primarily sensed
through vision and are typically presented visually in experiments,
but they can obviously be experienced through non-visual senses
too.

have a similarly instinctive sense of how to map visual
dimensions of magnitude to qualities of their voice? To find
out, we test whether people who are congenitally deaf are
able to generate iconic vocalizations that reflect visual
dimensions of magnitude. Such a result would indicate that
size-vocalization correspondences can originate even in the
absence of auditory experience.

Origins of Cross-Modal Correspondences
To understand the origins of cross-modal correspondences,
scholars have focused on when these mappings arise in
development. One possibility is that people learn through
experience to associate auditory dimensions like pitch and
loudness with visual dimensions like size because of their
tight correlation in the environment. The physical laws of
sound dictate that bigger objects tend to produce lower
pitched and louder sounds, and research shows that listeners
are sensitive to these properties when judging the size of
falling objects (Grassi, 2005). Thus children might
internalize the statistical correlations between size, pitch and
loudness through their experience with colliding objects and
other sound producing events (Spence, 2011).
A second potential source of some crossmodal mappings
is language (Marks, Hammeal, & Bornstein, 1987; Smith &
Sera, 1992). For example, a child learning English will learn
to use the words “long” and “short” to describe extension in
both space and time. Or a child learning Mandarin will
learn that the word “gāo”, meaning ‘high’ or ‘tall’, also
occurs in the word “gāoyīn”, which means ‘high pitch’, and
in the word “gāoda” which can refer to someone or
something that is big and tall. This association is also
reinforced by many Chinese folk songs, in which the use of
high pitch (i.e. gāoyīn) is used to express strength and
power. Thus a Chinese child might learn to associate the
concepts of tall, big, and high-pitched and their
corresponding opposites.
Finally, it is also possible that certain cross-modal
mappings—particularly those relating to magnitude—are
innate and arise from evolved sensory and neural
physiology. For example, humans may be equipped with a
generalized mental magnitude system that represents
prothetic dimensions like loudness, size, and brightness

1853

according to a common, amodal or multimodal magnitude
representation (Walsh, 2003). Bigger objects, louder sounds,
and brighter lights may correspond because they are
instinctively at the “more” end.
In support of claims for innateness, some crossmodal
links have been observed in prelinguistic infants who have
had just limited opportunity to learn associations between
acoustic and visual events. For example, Srinivasan and
Carey (2010) found that, like adults, nine-month-old infants
are more likely to remember pairings of lines and tones
when length and duration are positively correlated. Infants
aged 3-4 months showed an association between pitch and
both visual-spatial height and visual sharpness (Walker, et
al., 2010). The earliest age for which there is evidence of
crossmodal correspondence comes from a study by de Hevia
et al. (2014), which tested neonates 7 to 94 hours old.
Within just a few hours of birth, newborns showed
sensitivity to cross-modal mappings between the prothetic
domains of numerosity (number of spoken syllables),
temporal sequences (duration of syllables), and spatial
extent (visible line length).

investigate the influence of language and culture in forming
a sense of correspondence between magnitude and voice.

Cross-Modal Correspondence in Vocalization

Deaf participants were tested at the special education
boarding school they attended. The experiment was
conducted by a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese, who
was assisted by a bilingual teacher at the school who spoke
Mandarin and Standard Chinese Sign Language (CSL). The
teacher provided instructions in CSL.
Participants were first introduced to the experiment as a
group in their home classrooms. The assisting teacher
placed the stimuli – the four contrasting pairs of items – on
a desk in front of the class, with the two contrasting items of
each pair placed next to each other. She noted that the
objects in each pair were different, and asked the children to
sign the difference. The children were generally able to
identify each contrasting feature (e.g., “big” for the big ball
and “small” for the small ball). After going through all the
items, the teacher explained the basic procedure of the
experiment.
The children were told they would play a “guessing
game” with their teacher and the experimenter. The
experimenter would point to one of the two items of each
pair, and the children would make a vocal sound to
communicate the selected item to their teacher, whose back
would be turned so that she could not see. They were told
that they should not try to make a corresponding Mandarin
Chinese word nor a random sound. Instead they should try
to make a meaningful sound that they thought would help
their teacher choose the right item.
Participants were tested individually in a quiet office at
the school immediately following the classroom
introduction. The child was seated at a table beside the
experimenter, and the teacher sat with her back to the table.
All of the items were placed in a row in front of them, with
paired items placed next to each other and extra space
between pairs. The instructions were repeated by a signing
assistant as necessary.

Substantial evidence indicates that, from an early age,
people have a strong sense of correspondence between
certain visual and auditory dimensions. Do they similarly
possess a deeply ingrained sense of how these
correspondences extend to vocalization? How readily can
people generate iconic vocalizations that bear acoustic
properties corresponding to visual dimensions of
magnitude?
Some scholars have proposed that at least one mapping –
that between size and the pitch of vocalization – has an
ancient evolutionary history, evolving in adaptation to the
physiology of tetrapod vertebrate vocal tracts (Morton,
1994). Large, threatening animals produce low-pitched
vocalizations, and small, non-threatening animals produce
high-pitched ones. Ohala (1994) suggests that this
hypothetically innate size “frequency code” pervades
spoken communication and underlies a number of important
functions of intonation in speech, including the marking of
questions and the expression of many affective qualities
(e.g. deference, authority, submission, confidence).
According to the frequency code proposal, humans are
born with an instinctive sense of how to express magnitude
through the pitch of their voice. In addition, given evidence
of infants’ early sensitivity to correspondences between
visual magnitude and auditory dimensions like duration and
loudness, humans may also possess a strong sense of how to
express magnitude through the duration and intensity of
their voice. To assess these predictions, we examine
whether congenitally deaf Chinese children and young
adults, lacking auditory experience entirely, are nevertheless
able to generate iconic vocalizations to communicate
different visual dimensions of magnitude. We also test a
comparison group of hearing Chinese children to further

Methods
Participants
The first group of participants included 19 Chinese children
and young adults with congenital deafness resulting in
severe to complete hearing loss. Their mean age was 12.4
years (SD = 3.7 years). The second group consisted of 16
Chinese, Mandarin speaking children with normal hearing.
Their mean age was 10.1 years (SD = 0.83 years).

Materials
Participants communicated a set of 8 items contrasting
along four dimensions of magnitude: a short vs. a long
string (length), a small vs. a big ball (size), a little vs. a lot
of rice (amount), and a few (2) vs. many (5) marbles
(quantity).

Procedure

1854

On each trial, the experimenter first announced in
Mandarin the superordinate name of the pair of items that
would be tested (e.g. ball) so that the guessing teacher knew
which pair to select from. Then the participant produced a
sound to communicate the selected item to the teacher. The
teacher then turned toward the pair of items and pointed to
indicate her guess of which one had been selected. No other
feedback was provided.
Each item was tested once during a session. One item of
each pair was selected in the first block, and the remaining
item was selected in the second block. The order of items
was randomized between participants. The session was
audio-recorded for analysis.
This same basic procedure was also used with the hearing
children who participated while attending their day school.
The primary difference was that the instructions and
experiment were conducted in Mandarin by the
experimenter.

Analysis
Acoustic measurements Acoustic measurements were
made with Praat phonetic analysis software (Boersma,
2001). The onset and offset of each vocalization was
marked in a textgrid without knowledge of its associated,
and afterwards the intervals were labeled for analysis.
Duration, intensity, and pitch were measured automatically.
Statistical analyses Statistical analyses with mixed effects
models were conducted using the lme4 package in R.
Significance tests were calculated using chi-square tests that
compared the improvement in fit of mixed-effect models
with and without the factor of interest. Dimension (e.g. size)
was included as a random effect in models collapsing across
all items, and participant was included as a random effect in
all models.

Results
Figure 1 shows the complete results for deaf and hearing
participants.2 As can be seen, for many of the domains, both
groups reliably used the duration and intensity of their voice
to communicate greater magnitude. In contrast, only hearing
participants reliably used pitch – specifically, higher pitch
for greater magnitude. Below we first report the results with
each of the items collapsed together into greater versus
lesser magnitude, and then we report each domain of
magnitude separately.

Magnitude: Greater vs. Lesser (All Items)
All participants together produced vocalizations with a
mean duration of 690 ms for greater items and 590 ms for
lesser items. Magnitude was a reliable predictor of duration,

In a few cases, our analyses revealed a reliable interaction
between age and magnitude for deaf participants. Because of the
limited space available here, we save report of these interactions
for a future article.

χ2(1) = 17.6, b = 0.10, 95% CI = [0.06, 0.15], p < .001.
There was no interaction between magnitude and hearing
ability, χ2(1) = 1.2, p = .27. Separately, hearing participants
produced a mean duration of 650 ms for greater items and
510 ms for lesser items, which was a reliable difference,
χ2(1) = 10.4, p = .001, b = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.22]. Deaf
participants produced a mean duration of 730 ms for greater
items and 650 ms for lesser items, which was also reliable,
χ2(1) = 8.8, p = .003, b = 0.08, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.13].
Overall, participants produced a mean intensity of 62.8
dB for greater items and 58.9 dB for lesser items, which was
a reliable difference, χ2(1) = 82.9, p < .001, b = 3.9, 95% CI
= [3.1, 4.7]. There was a reliable interaction between
magnitude and hearing ability, χ2(1) = 6.1, b = 1.9, 95% CI
= [0.4, 3.5], p = .01. Hearing participants produced a mean
intensity of 64.7 dB for greater items and 59.8 dB for lesser
items, which was a reliable difference, χ2(1) = 63.9, p <
.001, b = 4.99, 95% CI = [3.9, 6.0]. Deaf participants
produced a mean intensity of 61.3 dB for greater items and
58.2 dB for lesser items, which was also reliable χ2(1) =
26.9, p < .001, b = 3.0, 95% CI = [1.9, 4.2].
Overall, participants produced a mean pitch of 297 Hz for
greater items and 285 Hz. for lesser items. Magnitude was a
reliable predictor of pitch, χ2(1) = 4.5, p = .034, b = 11.6,
95% CI = [0.9, 22.4]. There was a reliable interaction
between magnitude and hearing ability, χ2(1) = 11.4, p <
.001, b = 37.0, 95% CI = [15.7, 51.2]. Hearing participants
produced a mean pitch of 300 Hz for greater items and 269
Hz for lesser items, which was a reliable difference, χ2(1) =
11.0, p < .001, b = 32.8, 95% CI = [13.8, 51.7]. Deaf
participants produced a mean pitch of 295 Hz for greater
items and 296 Hz for lesser items, which was not reliable,
χ2(1) = 0.39, p = .53.
In summary, both groups showed a strong inclination to
produce longer and louder vocalizations to communicate the
greater items compared to shorter, quieter vocalizations for
the lesser items. Hearing participants, but not deaf
participants, produced higher pitched vocalizations for
greater magnitude items and lower pitched vocalizations for
lesser items.

Length: Long vs. Short
Overall, participants produced a mean duration of 760 ms
for the long string and 590 ms for the short string. Length
was a reliable predictor of duration,
χ2(1) = 11.1, p < .001, b = 0.18, 95% CI = [0.08, 0.28].
There was a marginal interaction between length and
hearing ability, χ2(1) = 3.1, p = .08, b = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.36]. Hearing participants produced a mean duration
of 840 ms for the long string and 570 ms for the short string,
which was a reliable difference, χ2(1) = 6.6, p = .01, b =
0.27, 95% CI = [0.07, 0.47]. Deaf participants produced a
mean duration of 700 ms for the long string and 600 ms for
the short string, which was also reliable, χ2(1) = 6.9, p =
.009, b = 0.10, CI = [0.03, 0.17].
Overall, participants produced a mean intensity of 63.7
dB for the long string and 58.9 dB for the short string.

Length was a reliable predictor of intensity, χ2(1) = 26.0, p
< .001, b = 4.8, CI = [3.2, 6.3]. There was no interaction
between hearing and length, χ2(1) = 0.81, p = .37. Hearing
participants produced a mean intensity of 65.6 dB for the
long string and 60.1 dB for the short string, which was a

reliable difference, χ2(1) = 13.3, p < .001, b = 5.5, 95% CI =
[3.0, 8.1]. Deaf participants produced a mean intensity of

Figure 1. Average differences in acoustic properties between contrasting items. Deaf participants are displayed on the left, hearing participants on the
right. The x-axis shows the three acoustic properties, and the y-axis shows normalized values for comparison between the properties. Error bars represent
the standard errors of the mean differences. Stars indicate level of significance: * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001. For example, deaf participants
produced vocalizations that were ~ 0.4 SDs longer in duration for the long string compared to the short string.

Overall, participants produced a mean pitch of 287 Hz for
the long string and 290 Hz for the short string, which was
not a reliable difference, χ2(1) = 0.04, p = .85. There was no
interaction between length and hearing ability, χ2(1) = 0.28,
p = 0.60. In summary, both groups produced longer and
louder vocalizations to refer to the long string, and shorter,
softer vocalizations to refer to the short string. Neither
group used pitch to distinguish between the lengths of
string.

Size: Big vs. Small
Overall, participants produced a mean duration of 620 ms
for the big ball and 570 ms for the small ball, which was not
a reliable difference, χ2(1) = 1.98, p = .15. There was no
reliable interaction between size and hearing ability, χ2(1) =
0.37, p = .54.
Overall, participants produced a mean intensity of 63.5
dB for the big ball and 58.7 dB for the small ball. Size was a
reliable predictor of intensity, χ2(1) = 26.2, p < .001, b = 4.8,
95% CI = [3.2, 6.3]. There was no reliable interaction
between size and hearing ability, χ2(1) = 2.23, p = .13.
Hearing participants produced a mean intensity 65.0 dB for
the big ball and 59.1 dB for the small ball, which was a
reliable difference, χ2(1) = 20.7, p < .001, b = 6.0, 95% CI =
[4.1, 7.9]. Deaf participants produced a mean intensity of
62.2 dB for the big ball and 58.5 dB for the small ball,

which was also reliable, χ2(1) = 8.76, p = .003, b = 3.7, 95%
CI = [1.4, 6.0].
Overall, participants produced a mean pitch of 308 Hz for
the big ball and 282 Hz for the small ball. Size was a
reliable predictor of pitch, χ2(1) = 5.11, p = .024, b = 27.0,
95% CI = [3.8, 50.1]. There was no reliable interaction
between size and hearing ability, χ2(1) = 0.61, p = 0.43.
Hearing participants produced a mean pitch of 299 Hz for
the big ball and 263 Hz for the small ball, which was a
marginally reliable difference, χ2(1) = 3.26, p = 0.071, b =
36.9, 95% CI = [15.4, 76.9]. Deaf participants produced a
mean pitch of 315 Hz for the big ball and 295 Hz for the
small ball, which was not reliable, χ2(1) = 1.94, p = .16.
In summary, both groups produced louder, but not longer,
vocalizations to distinguish between the big and small ball.
Both showed a trend of using higher pitch for the big ball;
however, this tendency was only marginally reliable for
hearing participants and not reliable for deaf participants.

Amount: A Lot vs. A Little
Overall, participants produced a mean duration of 690 ms
for a lot of rice and 630 ms for a little rice. Amount was not
a reliable predictor of duration, χ2(1) = 1.66, p = .20. There
was no reliable interaction between amount and hearing
ability, χ2(1) = 0.05, p = 0.83.
Overall, participants produced a mean intensity of 62.1
dB for a lot of rice and 59.1 dB for a little rice. Amount was

1856

a reliable predictor of intensity, χ2(1) = 9.19, p = .002, b =
3.11, 95% CI = [1.18, 5.03]. There was a marginally reliable
interaction between amount and hearing ability, χ2(1) =
3.09, p = .079, b = 3.3, 95% CI = [-0.40, 6.96]. Hearing
participants produced a mean intensity of 64.2 dB for a lot
of rice and 59.6 dB for a little rice, which was a reliable
difference, χ2(1) = 16.21, p < .001, b = 5.06, 95% CI =
[3.16, 6.88]. Deaf participants produced a mean intensity of
60.4 dB for a lot of rice and 58.7 dB for a little rice, which
was not reliable, χ2(1) = 1.21, p = 0.27.
Overall, participants produced a mean pitch of 294 Hz for
a lot of rice and 272 Hz for a little rice. Amount was a
reliable predictor of pitch, χ2(1) = 5.04, p = .024, b =, 95%
CI = [3.3, 45.3]. There was a reliable interaction between
amount and hearing ability, χ2(1) = 8.62, p = .003, b =
57.90, 95% CI = [20.8, 94.8]. Hearing participants produced
a mean pitch of 303 Hz for a lot of rice and 249 Hz for a
little rice, which was a reliable difference, χ2(1) = 10.1, p =
0.001, b = 57.84, 95% CI = [26.8, 88.1]. Deaf participants
produced a mean pitch of 288 Hz for a lot of rice and 288
Hz for a little rice, which was not reliable, χ2(1) = 0, p =
0.98.
In summary, neither group distinguished a lot from a little
with the duration of their vocalizations, although hearing
participants reliably made this distinction by intensity. Deaf
participants showed the same pattern, although it was not
reliable. Hearing, but not deaf participants, distinguished a
lot from a little with higher pitch.

Quantity: Many vs. Few
Overall, participants produced a mean duration of 690 ms
for many marbles and 560 ms for a few marbles. Quantity
was a reliable predictor of duration, χ2(1) = 6.07, p = 0.014,
b = 0.12, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.22]. There was no reliable
interaction between hearing and quantity, χ2(1) = 0.04, p =
0.85. Hearing participants produced a mean duration of 610
ms for many marbles and 470 ms for a few marbles, which
was a reliable difference, χ2(1) = 3.92, p = 0.048, b = 0.13,
95% CI = [0.10, 0.27]. Deaf participants produced a mean
duration of 750 ms for many marbles and 640 ms for a few
marbles, which was not reliable, χ2(1) = 2.61, p = 0.11.
Overall, participants produced a mean intensity of 61.9
dB for many marbles and 58.9 dB for a few marbles.
Quantity was a reliable predictor of intensity, χ2(1) = 11.92,
p < .001, b = 3.03, 95% CI = [1.41, 4.65]. There was no
reliable interaction between quantity and hearing ability,
χ2(1) = 0.24, p = 0.62. Hearing participants produced a mean
intensity of 63.8 dB for many marbles and 60.4 dB for a few
marbles, which was a reliable difference, χ2(1) = 7.40, p =
0.007, b = 3.48, 95% CI = [1.13, 5.81]. Deaf participants
produced a mean intensity of 60.5 dB for many marbles and
57.8 dB for a few marbles, which was also reliable, χ2(1) =
5.00, p = 0.025, b = 2.69, 95% CI = [0.37, 5.01].
Overall, participants produced a mean pitch of 299 Hz for
many marbles and 296 Hz for a few marbles. Quantity was
not a reliable predictor of pitch, χ2(1) = 0.03, p = 0.85, b = 2.19, 95% CI = [-25.86, 22.17]. There was a reliable

interaction between quantity and hearing ability, χ2(1) =
4.32, p = 0.038, b = 48.6, 95% CI = 2.94, 94.15]. Hearing
participants produced a mean pitch of 310 Hz for many
marbles and 279 Hz for a few marbles, which was not a
reliable difference, χ2(1) = 1.93, p = 0.16. Deaf participants
produced a mean pitch of 292 Hz for many marbles and 309
Hz for a few marbles, which was marginally reliable, χ2(1) =
3.56, p = 0.059, b = -23.03, 95% CI = [-46.53, 0.99].
In summary, both groups produced louder vocalizations
for many compared to few marbles. Only hearing
participants reliably produced longer vocalizations for
many, although deaf participants showed the same numeric
pattern. Hearing participants did not use pitch to distinguish
amount, and deaf participants showed only a marginal trend
to produce lower pitched vocalizations for many.

Discussion
From an early age, people show evidence of strong
associations between certain visual and auditory
dimensions, such as size, duration, and loudness. Do people
possess a similarly robust sense of how to extend these
cross-modal correspondences to the production of iconic
vocalizations? We examined the ability of congenitally deaf
Chinese children and young adults—who literally lack any
auditory experience to speak of—to generate iconic
vocalizations to communicate different visual dimensions of
magnitude. Thus we investigated whether mappings
between visual magnitude and different vocal qualities can
originate even in the absence of auditory experience.
Both deaf participants and a comparison group of hearing
Chinese children reliably produced longer and louder
vocalizations for greater magnitude items, compared to
shorter, quieter vocalizations for items with lesser
magnitude. Separate analysis of each domain suggests that
both deaf and hearing participants also made more nuanced
vocal distinctions between the different dimensions. For
instance, both more consistently used the duration of their
voice to distinguish length compared to other dimensions.
Altogether, these results show that people share a strong
sense of how to translate dimensions of visible magnitude
into the duration and intensity of their vocalizations, and
that this sense transcends auditory experience.
Some scholars have postulated an innate size frequency
code that humans have inherited in adaptive response to the
physiology of tetrapod vertebrate vocal tracts (Ohala, 1994).
However, we found that only hearing, and not deaf
participants reliably used pitch to distinguish magnitude.
One likely reason for this is the especially fine motor
control required to modulate pitch (Fitch, 2010), at which
our deaf participants are relatively unpracticed and
disadvantaged given their lack of auditory feedback. The
result also suggests that the association between pitch and
size may depend on a functioning auditory system and
learning.
Further evidence in favor of learning comes from our
results with hearing participants. Counter to the size
frequency code, hearing Chinese children produced higher

1857

pitched vocalizations for greater compared to lesser
magnitude items. Notably, this pattern also differs from two
previous studies using a vocal charades task with American
undergraduates, who tended to produce high-pitched
vocalizations for small and low-pitched vocalizations for big
(Perlman & Cain, in press; Perlman, Dale, & Lupyan, under
review). The hypothesis that associations between size and
pitch are subject to learning is also supported by previous
developmental studies. For example, whereas adults
matched higher pitched tones with smaller lights, children
did not make this association until 11 years of age (Marks,
et al., 1987).
There is good reason to consider that hearing participants’
use of high pitch for greater magnitude is shaped by their
experience with Mandarin and Chinese culture. Previous
work has found that the conventional metaphorical
expressions a language uses to describe pitch—for example
“high” and “low” in English or the equivalents of “thin” and
“thick” in Farsi—influence the spatial dimensions by which
pitch is conceptualized by speakers (Dolscheid, Shayan,
Majid, & Casasanto, 2013). Similarly, we described above
the use of the Mandarin root “gāo,” which, can be used to
refer to a person who is big and tall in size, and also to a
high pitched sound. This association is also displayed by
other aspects of Chinese culture, such as the use of high
pitch to express strength and power in folk songs. Thus it is
likely that the hearing children in our study were influenced
by these linguistic and cultural conventions.
An additional explanation for the pitch-size
correspondence produced by Chinese children may relate to
the physiology of vocalization. According to the “effort
code,” vocalizations involving higher effort and intensity
tend to occur with a rise in pitch (Gussenhoven, 2002). Thus
the production of higher pitch may have been a physical
consequence of producing more intense vocalizations.
However, while worth consideration, the disassociation
between size and pitch with deaf participants weighs against
this possibility.

Conclusion
Our findings highlight the human potential to generate novel
vocalizations that are grounded in our conceptions of
magnitude and space. While the association of size and
pitch may be subject to linguistic and cultural influence, the
association of size with vocal qualities of duration and
intensity is quite robust. Even when people entirely lack
auditory experience, they nevertheless share a strong sense
of how to translate visual dimensions of magnitude into the
duration and intensity of vocalization. The results show that
cross-modal correspondences between dimensions of
magnitude extend to the motor system and vocal tract, and
they are instinctively incorporated into the production of
iconic vocalizations.
