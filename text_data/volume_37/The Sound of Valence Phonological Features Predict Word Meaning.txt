Even though these findings indicate a significant difference
between high and low valence of words on the basis of
individual sound features, Study 1 does not indicate whether
phonological cues predict valence across language for a
combination of a small set of phonological cues.
Study 2
In the second study we investigated which phonological
cues would predict valence across the three languages. The
principle parsimony was adhered to, preferring an easy
(fewer phonological cues) explanation to a complicated
explanation (many phonological cues).
    In order to find the combination of the least cues with an
accuracy as high as possible, all cues that were deemed to
be important for the language(s) concerned were used in a
stepwise discriminant analysis and a binary logistic
regression, using a leave-one-out cross-validation.                 Figure 1. Venn diagram of cues for distinguishing between
