ilarly critical for inferring the meaning of the modifier. By
the same logic, function words should be even harder to
learn without some understanding of their syntactic relations.
Thus, if syntactic development is related in some way to age,
we should see larger age effects on predicate and function
word acquisition than on noun acquisition.
Results Each CDI form contains a mixture of words in dif-
ferent classes. We adopt the categorization of Bates et al.
(1994), splitting words into nouns, predicates (verbs and ad-
jectives), function words, and other words. For each child’s
vocabulary, we compute the proportion of the total words in
each of these categories that they are reported to produce.
   For each of the four languages in our sample, we plot
these proportions against total vocabulary. These functions              Figure 5: For each language and lexical category, the model’s
