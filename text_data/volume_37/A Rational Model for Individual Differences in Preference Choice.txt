Figure 3: Proportion of choices for different effects and their explanation. (A) X and Y are equi-preferable. (B) Adding an option Z inferior
to Y increases the preference for Y relative to X. (C) Adding an option Z even more extreme than Y, in relation to X, increases the preference
for Y. (D) Adding an option Z very similar to Y, but not clearly more or less preferable to Y, decreases the preference for Y relative to X. (E)
X and Y lie on the equi-preference curve which represents a fixed value; any option above this curve would be considered more valuable, and
below would be considered less valuable. (F) The attraction decoy makes Y appear better on average. (G) The compromise decoy make Y
appear better on average. (H) The valuation of Y and Z are highly correlated, such that they tend to be considered both better than X or both
worse than X, for different settings of the hidden variable γ. When they are both worse than X, X is chosen; when they are both better than
X, Y is chosen half the time (Z the other half). Thus, on average, X is chosen more often than Y, even though they are on average considered
