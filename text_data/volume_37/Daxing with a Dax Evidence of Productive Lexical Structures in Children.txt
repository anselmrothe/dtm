expected the first novel word—which had referred, as a verb,
to the action (e.g., shoveling)—to also refer, as a noun, to the
artifact that helped carry out the action (e.g., to the shovel).
Due to this expectation, children may have excluded the arti-
fact as the meaning of the second novel word, believing that
the first novel word already referred to it. This finding sug-
gests that children do not represent the nominal and verbal
uses of familiar words like shovel as separate lexical items.
Rather, children have formed lexical structures to support the
flexible extension of these words across their noun and verb
meanings.

of the task in our analyses. Consequently, unlike in Experi-
ments 1 and 2, children did not receive feedback on any of
their choices in these trials, and children were not excluded
on the basis of their performance. A final distinction in the
procedure for Experiment 3 is that the majority of the parents
of participants filled out a vocabulary survey, which consisted
of 33 flexible noun/verb pairs (derived in part from Clark &
Clark, 1979). The survey probed parental report of produc-
tion and comprehension separately (e.g., for the noun/verb
pair bike, parents were asked to report whether their child
understood the noun form bike, the verb form to bike, and
whether they produced each of these forms). The addition
of this survey was motivated by the finding in Lippeveld and
Oshima-Takane (2010) that extension between verb and ar-
tifact labels could be correlated with frequency of flexible
