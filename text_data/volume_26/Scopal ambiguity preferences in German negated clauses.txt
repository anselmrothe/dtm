                                Abstract
   When following a negated matrix clause, adverbial clauses
   (ACs) like “because it was paid very well” in (1) can be                        IP
   interpreted as residing within the scope of the negation (1b),
   or outside of it (1).                                                                                             AC

   Depending on the scope of the negative, the interpretation
   differs dramatically: Whereas Peter did in fact not quit his job      Figure 1

   been shown for English (see Frazier & Clifton, 1996), that
