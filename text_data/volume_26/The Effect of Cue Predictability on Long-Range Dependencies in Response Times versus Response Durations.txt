                          Introduction
In most psychological experiments, the variability in human
behavior is divided into two categories: some variations in
measurement are explained by the experimental factors, and
other variations are not. The latter category is often termed
error variance, and it usually does not play a role in
theorizing about the psychological processes under
examination. One reason why researchers ignore error
variance is because they often assume that it is effectively             Figure 1: Illustrations of white noise (top) and pink noise

and far from trivial to explain. We believe that further
empirical and theoretical investigations into the sources of
long-range dependence in human behavior will prove to be
valuable to studies of perception and cognition.
