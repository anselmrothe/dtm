Problem solving in everyday life, as well as the laboratory,
can be quite difficult. Often a problem or activity can seem
unduly difficult when one does not know the key action
necessary for completing the problem. A key action can be
defined as a single action or behavior that can be singled out
as the key to the solution. Examples of key actions abound
in everyday life. A proper roux cannot be made without
engaging in continual stirring. Algebra problems become
routine once one understands how to balance the equation
and isolate the variables. Finally, as I have learned one too                   Figure 1: The Nine-Dot Problem and its Solution

the harder that problem will be to solve.
    Kershaw and Ohlsson (2004; Kershaw et al., 2003)
increased solution rates through a training procedure that
targeted the multiple factors of difficulty -- perceptual,
knowledge, and process -- that hinder the production of non-
dot turns. This training procedure was used in Experiment
I.
    A new facet of the procedure was to give participants the
first line of the solution to each target problem. Weisberg
and Alba (1981) raised the solution rate of the nine-dot
problem to 62% by giving participants the first line in
addition to instructing them to go outside of the box set up
by the dots. The placement of this first line was chosen
based on an analysis by MacGregor et al. (2001). For two
of the target problems, the first line extended into the non-
dot space.
    The addition of the first line influenced the predictions
for this experiment. One prediction was that first line would
not affect the order nor the magnitude of the solution rates
for the five target problems that were reported by Kershaw              Figure 2: 11-Dot, 10-Dot, Displaced Nine-Dot, and
and Ohlsson (2004), with the 11-dot problem being the                            Three-Turn Problems with First Line
