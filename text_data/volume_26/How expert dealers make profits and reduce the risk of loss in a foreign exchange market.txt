novice or general investors, he did not clarify what kind of
biases the skilled dealers had or were free from. In addition,
it is a question that his subjects were actually expert dealers.
In the experimental environment used in (Smith 1996;
Smith 1997), each skilled subject was asked to make deals
with a pre-installed computer dealer while, in that used in
(Izumi, Nakamura & Ueda 2002), subjects were asked, in
pairs, to make deals with one another through computer
network, which virtually realized human-human dealing. In
this sense, the latter environment can be said to be closer to
the real dealing situation than the former. However, it is also
a question that all of their subjects were actually expert
dealers.

participate in our experiments and compare their
performance with novice or general investors’ one. Here,

Analysis in terms of the prospect theory
From the results of the two experiments, we can say as
follows: Expert dealers can cut losses so fast that they may
prevent the losses from increasing and, at the same time, can
take profits (or lock in profits) after enough profits are made.
On the other hand, novices seem to be reluctant to sell
currencies that lose value while they are inclined to lock in
profits no sooner than the currencies they hold are profitable.
Why is there a sharp contrast between the way experts make
decision and that the novice do?                                                                            Stepwise
