problems should depend on their experience. Naïve
individuals are likely to tackle their initial problems using a
strategy that is close to neo-Darwinian. They should be
constrained solely by the statement of the problem, the
problem shape itself, and their existing perceptual and
cognitive processes. As they try out the various possible
tactical steps, they learn their consequences, which are
summarized in Figure 2. Learning occurs whether or not a
tactical step turns out to be useful in solving a problem.
Any problem allows only a limited set of tactical options,
and so individuals should gradually narrow down the steps
that are left to explore. Likewise, granted that the problem
is within their competence, they should at length hit upon a
sequence of steps that leads to a solution. In addition, some
pieces in the problem shape are visually salient, and they
may bias participants to attempt certain tactical steps first.
Saliency is likely to depend on the perimeter of the shape.
Any piece in the perimeter should be visually salient if it
has at least one adjacent piece that is also in the perimeter
and is at right angles to it. In addition, a piece should be
more salient if both adjacent pieces are at right angles. A
visually salient component comprises a group of such
visually salient pieces that are adjacent to each other. These
principles are probably special cases of broader factors
governing visual salience. The acquisition of tactical
knowledge depends on perceptual abilities, e.g., subitizing a
small number of squares, and conceptual and inferential
abilities, e.g., a grasp of the concepts of squares and pieces,      Figure 3: The eight problems used in Experiment 1. We

Results and discussion
Figure 4 presents the mean latencies to solve the eight
problems. The two blocks did not differ reliably (z = 1.61,
n.s.), and therefore we collapsed their latencies for analysis.
Participants solved problems with a salient solution reliably
faster than those without a salient solution (Wilcoxon
signed-rank test, z = 3.85, p<.001). In addition, they also
solved problems with a symmetric initial shape reliably
faster than those with an asymmetrical initial shape
(Wilcoxon signed-rank test, z = 2.09, p<.05). The two
variables did not interact. These results demonstrate that
existing factors in the problems can constrain problem
solving strategies. To investigate how people develop
strategies to cope with shape problems, however,
participants would need to solve a series of problems calling
for the removal of different numbers of pieces, and to think
aloud as they solve the problems. Experiment 2 employed
this procedure.

problems of any degree of complexity.
   Experiment 3 corroborated the prediction that constraints
in the form of tactical knowledge do transfer to new
problems. Participants acquired tactical knowledge during
training trials, and they continued to use these tactics for
problems that could be solved in other ways. When the
tactics were inappropriate, they were slowed down because
they had to revert to a longer exploratory stage to find the
right tactics. Luchins (1942) discovered that deterministic
strategies transfer in this way. Our results generalize his
findings to show that even when experience leads at best to
a strategy that is not deterministic, the strategy nevertheless
transfers.
   Is the strategic shift an instance of insight? The answer
depends on what one takes insight to be (cf. Weisberg,
1986; Kaplan & Simon, 1990; Isaak & Just, 1995; Ormerod,
MacGregor, & Chronicle, 2002).             When the current
constraints fail to yield a solution, the shift yields new
constraints on the generation of tactical steps. This change,
in turn, can yield the solution of a problem. The
development of strategies for shape problems accordingly
reflects a series of small insights in which constraints are
changed as a result of strategic shifts.
