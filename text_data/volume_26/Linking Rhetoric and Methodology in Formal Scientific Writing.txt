Note that the actual features by which we represent an article are
the frequencies of each subsystem’s indicator features, each
measured relative to its siblings. So, for example, one feature is
Elaboration/Appositive, whose value is the total number of oc-
currences of Appositive indicators divided by the total number
of occurrences of Elaboration indicators (Appositive + Clarify-
ing). The relative frequencies of Elaboration, Extension, and
Enhancement within Conjunction are also used as features.
