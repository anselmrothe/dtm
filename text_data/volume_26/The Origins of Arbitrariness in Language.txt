close to it.
   The ‚Äúsmall‚Äù languages contained 15 form-meaning
pairs, while the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù languages contained 100 form-
meaning pairs. For ‚Äúiconic‚Äù languages, each form-
meaning pair coincided on two of the three dimensions,
which were randomly selected for each pair. For exam-
ple, a possible iconic form-meaning pair was: form {3, 2,
8}, meaning {3, 5, 8}. Note that for the iconic languages,
there is thus a significant correlation across all three pairs
of dimensions. For ‚Äúarbitrary‚Äù languages, the values for
each form-meaning pair were selected completely ran-
domly. For each form-meaning pair, the network saw
five separate presentations, one with the canonical pair,
and four with noisy variations on this pair. For each of
these variations, each dimension value was changed by 1
with a probability of 0.2.
   Since these were feed-forward networks, they only
learned the associations in one direction. Each net-
work contained 30 meaning input units, 30 form output
units, and 64 hidden units and was trained using back-
propagation. Figure 3 shows the mean square error as
training progressed. As can be seen, iconic languages
have an early advantage because of the correlations that
back-propagation can easily discover. For the small lan-
guages, this advantage holds throughout training. For
the large languages, however, the network learning the
arbitrary language eventually overtakes the one learning           Figure 3: Learning of iconic and arbitrary languages by a
