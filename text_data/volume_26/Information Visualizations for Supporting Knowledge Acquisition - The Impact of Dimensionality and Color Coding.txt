big). Due to the spreadsheet size it was impossible to see the
data of all projects without scrolling. A pilot study showed
that using this spreadsheet to memorize the abstract data set
and to recognize relations between information units was a
very difficult task for the subjects.
   In order to implement our experimental manipulation, we
represented the same data set by means of information
visualizations that were either 2D or 3D and that were either
monochrome or used color to represent one of the attributes.
All of the manipulations (i.e., dimensionality and color
coding) referred to the same specific attribute (“construction
progress”) and the way it was represented. In the 2D-                    Figure 4: Three-dimensional color-coded information
