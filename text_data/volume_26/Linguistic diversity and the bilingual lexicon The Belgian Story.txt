mechanisms such as chaining, convention and pre-emption
influence naming patterns.
  Concerning the bilingual naming patterns, the data (at
group and individual levels) reject the two-pattern
hypothesis. So, we can conclude that the French and Dutch
naming patterns of the bilinguals are not kept separate and
hence don’t parallel the naming patterns of the French and
Dutch monolinguals, respectively. The data are more
consistent with the one-pattern hypothesis, suggesting that
the two naming patterns of the bilinguals merge into one.
However, the data also show that the assumption of a
perfect match between the naming patterns is too strong and
that is should be attenuated, since bilinguals did not use the
French and Dutch category names as perfect translation
equivalents. Apparently, even if the two naming patterns of
bilinguals deviate from the corresponding monolingual
naming patterns, naming in each of both languages is still
influenced by culture- and language-specific factors:
bilinguals name the objects in a way that is consistent with
the language in which they name the object. This is not so
surprising, since language and culture can’t be considered
separately. On the other hand, the convergence of the two
naming patterns on one naming pattern suggests that
bilinguals do not only satisfy cultural and linguistic
constraints, but also individual cognitive constraints: it is
less demanding on the limited sources of memory to store
only one set of mappings between objects and names. So, in
a way, bilinguals do find a set of mappings between words
and objects that meet linguistic, cultural and individual
memory constraints.
