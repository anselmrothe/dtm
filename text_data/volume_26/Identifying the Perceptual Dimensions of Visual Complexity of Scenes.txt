Figure 3: Representation given by Isomap for the structure group. The space shows on the arrow axis, a principal direction
corresponding to increasing quantity of objects and clutter. The images that are far away from that direction are images that
exhibit the highest amount of variability in how they were grouped in relation to other images. Scenes of medium and low
level of clutter exhibit more variations along a second direction, possibly related to symmetry and spatial arrangement (cf.
Figure 4).
