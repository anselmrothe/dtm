has primarily investigated how use affects an already-

of goal-directed activity on inductive reasoning would
provide an interesting extension of this line of research.
Overview
To examine the effects of goal-directed activity on
categorization and inductive reasoning, the present study
exposes naïve participants to an artificial natural kind
domain (the “Creatures”). Over a four-session learning
phase, these participants acquire knowledge about the
different types of features possessed by the Creatures and
use this knowledge to assess the Creatures according to a
particular goal. These goals are manipulated between
groups: One group is given a goal that directs them to utilize
a certain subset of the Creatures’ features, while the other        Figure 1: Examples of Creature cards. Note. Actual cards

infer that the novel property would be more likely to
generalize to a Creature that is more pictorially similar or
one that is more similar with respect to AP properties.
NAP vs. PR trials were analogously designed to compete an
option sharing more PR features with one sharing more
NAP-related features. The number of AP vs. PR and NAP
vs. PR trials was matched. Trial order was randomized to
create a single task list that was administered to all
participants.                                                      Figure 3: Mean number of blocks to criterion by day on the
