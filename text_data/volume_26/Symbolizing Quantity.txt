                       3 Experiment
We conducted a pilot experiment to see how much people
agreed on what they would call large, small or medium. We
expected agreement across subjects on their labeling.
Furthermore, we expected to find out how people go about
mapping these symbols to quantity values in a specific
scenario – being presented with all the examples at once.
And if people indeed agreed on their partitioning, then we
expected to gain insight about where they drew the
boundaries.
Method
The experiment consisted of two tasks – Size Labeling task
and Country Naming task. In the size labeling task, subjects
were presented with an outline political map of Africa. The
countries were numbered from 1 through 54, and at the                  Figure 1. Agreement across subjects on their most frequent
