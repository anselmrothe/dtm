lems were introduced, test scores began to fluctuate severely.
Scores would drop to, or near, zero, rebound, and then drop
again, as the network struggled to distinguish the new con-
cept (Usub) from the old concept (Simple). Over time, al-
though fluctuation continued, overall test scores increased. In
a few cases, SU midterm scores reached 100%, however the
majority of cases peaked at 70-75%. When Parts problems
were introduced, the pattern of fluctuating scores was accen-
tuated. Midterm scores immediately plummeted, although it
is interesting to note that even the downward drop was often
not smooth, but marked by brief plateaus and recoveries. Per-
formance continued to deteriorate for longer than in the SU
training segment, with scores fluctuating lower and lower. In
contrast to the SU midterm scores, SUP midterm scores ap-
peared to tighten in closer and closer to complete failure (for
a while nearly all midterms fluctuated well under 20%). This
behavior is predictable, because it is harder to distinguish
three concepts from one another than two concepts. Even-
tually, performance began to improve, with prominent indi-
vidual differences, as each network learner identified subtle
patterns to accurately identify each concept. Eventually, vir-
tually all midterm scores surpassed 70%. The average score
on the final comprehensive exam was 81.9% (standard devia-
tion 8.23). It is important to note that the final test results for
Incremental Learning were better than either Drill and Test
or Fully Integrated Learning, in spite of interim results that
sometimes appeared poorer than either other type of exper-
iment. The maximum exam SUP score was 95.6%, higher
than any score reached in a Fully Integrated learning exper-
iment. As evaluated with a t-test, the Incremental Learning

   The types of errors that the network made followed a pat-
tern. As each new training period began, the network ap-
peared to “flail”, choosing first one answer then another on
successive exam questions. However, this “flailing” gradu-
