Materials and Design
   The RPA task consists of 20 pairs of source and target
pictures in which objects in the paired pictures depict the
same relationship using unique objects. On a single page,
participants viewed the two pictures in a set. An arrow
pointed to a source object in the top picture, and the
participant was asked to select the corresponding object in
the bottom picture (cf. Markman & Gentner, 1993). For
the example in Figure 1, the top picture represents “dog
chasing cat chasing mouse” and the bottom picture
represents “woman chasing boy chasing girl”. If an arrow
pointed to the cat, the correct relational response would be
the boy in the bottom picture. All pictures contained
extra items not depicting the relevant relationship, and the
number of total objects was standardized across pictures
per condition. Most image sets contain a total of five
objects.
   Four versions of each picture set were constructed in
order to manipulate two variables in a 2x2 design. The
first variable was the presence or absence of a perceptual
distractor in the target picture, defined by strong featural
similarity to an object in the source picture. The featural
distractor was either an identical match to an object in the
source picture or was the same object in a slightly                                                               Problem 2-2a
different position. For example, in Figure 1 (top) the cat
is depicted sitting in the target picture but is not involved
in the chase. The featural distractor is never involved in
the relational structure of the target picture. In Figure 1        Figure 1. Sample stimuli, two relations with distractor
