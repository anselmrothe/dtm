Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness and limitations of vector diagrams, consisting of lines with arrows representing variables,
in statistical training. Nineteen undergraduates
learned advanced level statistics either with vector diagrams or in the conventional way and solved
three problems. Vector diagrams sometimes helped
the students understand descriptions in the text
which were difficult in conventional explanations,
but caused other difficulties. Vector diagrams were
useful for solving one of the three problems, but not
the other two. It is concluded that a property of diagrams or formulae can be a double-edged sword.

Tasks and Prediction

Students who are majoring in psychology or other
relevant disciplines have to study statistics. Despite
substantial effort by teachers, understanding statistics is often difficult for many students. This paper
reports the results of a practical experiment in which
the students learned to employ either “vector diagrams” or a conventional formula-based approach to
the basics of regression analysis. The students were
then asked to solve three problems using the given
technique they learned.
Unlike many previous studies on using diagrams in
educational settings, which focus only on the usefulness of diagrams, this study also investigates limitations of diagrams. Research on diagrammatic reasoning has found many “good” properties of diagrams (e.g., Barwise & Etchmendy, 1996; Cheng
& Simon, 1995; Larkin & Simon, 1987). The researchers seem to consider these properties as if they
are always support (at least do not impair) understanding and problem solving. The results of this
study suggest that the same property, which definitely makes the solution of a problem easy, sometimes makes another problem difficult. Similarly, the
results suggest that formulae do not necessarily have
“bad” properties.
The vector diagrams used in this study consist of
several vectors drawn as lines with arrows, each of
which corresponds to a variable. For example, the
correlation coefficient is defined as cos θ where θ is
the angle between two vectors, ~x = {x1 − x̄, · · · , xn −
x̄} and ~
y = {y1 − ȳ, · · · , yn − ȳ}. The regression
analysis is described as the projection of the dependent variable (actually the vector of the dependent

1321

These are two basic assumptions in this study about
the nature of diagrammatic and algebraic representations and operators.
One assumption is that the diagrammatic representation of a problem affords a far smaller number
of operators than the algebraic representations of
that problem. This assumption is two-fold. First,
the problem space (the set of all possible problem
states) is smaller when a problem is represented by
a diagram. In the chapters on vectors in mathematics textbooks, the only diagrammatic operators one
can commonly find are: extension (or reduction), rotation, projection, and (de)composition. Algebraic
representations, by contrast, allow many kinds of
manipulations such as the four basic operations of
arithmetic, expansion or factorization,
fraction
oper√
√ √
ations, root operations (e.g.,
a
∗
b
=
ab),
sumP
P
P
mation operations (e.g.,
(a + b) =
a+
b),
substitution, and so on. Second, I assume that the
search space (the set of problem states a student actually considers), is also smaller when a problem is
represented by a diagram. Whether a problem is
represented by a diagram or a formula, students do
not consider all possible operators because in each
case some operators are difficult to use.
The other assumption is that a formula and its
transformation become more concrete when they are
connected to a diagram. This assumption seems
to have no room for doubt because connecting a
formula to a diagram increases the number of attributes the formula has. This assumption is related
to the first assumption. Because of the limited number of diagrammatic operators, “diagrammatic inference” often requires using algebraic representations,
although the diagrams play a crucial role in the inference. This means that students often have to do
“heterogeneous inference,” inference that use multiple forms of representation (Barwise & Etchemendy,
1996).
This study claims that any property of diagrams
or formulae can be either a help or a hindrance in
problem solving. For example, considering only a

Table 1: Three Problems used in This Study.
Problem 1: The multiple correlation coefficient R indicates the goodness of fit of the
model in multiple regression analysis. Consider
the multiple correlation coefficient “R” in the
case of simple regression. Please explain the
relationship between this R and r, the simple
correlation coefficient for the two variables x
and y.
Problem 2: In the case of simple regression, if
the number of paired values (xi , yi ) is two, we
can describe the values of one variable by using
the other variable without any error, indicating
r = +1 or −1. Give an explanation for the
reason of this perfect description.
Problem 3: Explain the relationship between
the regression coefficient aˆ1 (= Sxy /Sxx ) and
the correlation coefficient r in the case of simple
regression by using only the two variances Sxx
and Syy . Sxy means the covariance for the two
variables x and y.

small number of diagrammatic operators can serve
either as a constraint on the search (This is expected
to be the case in Problem 1 in Table 1, as described
below), or as a limitation if the correct solution path
is outside of the search space (This is expected to be
the case in Problem 2). The abstractness of formulae
also can be an advantage or a disadvantage (This
contrast is expected to be shown between Problem
1 and Problem 3).
Problem 1 If students learn regression analysis in
a conventional way, R is defined by the formula
1 P

(yi − ȳ)(ŷi − ŷ)

R = q Pn
.

This formula means that R is defined as the correlation coefficient between the expected value ŷ and
the observed value y. In the case of simple regression, we can say ŷi = a0 + a1 xi1 and ŷ¯ = a0 + a1 x̄1 .
If these relations are used in the formula for R then
the conclusion R = |r| is obtained after a long series
of algebraic manipulations.
Using a vector diagram, R is defined as cos θ for
¯ · · · , ŷn − ŷ}
¯ and ~y = {y1 −
two vectors ~ŷ = {ŷ1 − ŷ,
ȳ, · · · , yn − ȳ} as shown in Figure 1. Vector ~ŷ is the
orthogonal projection of ~y on the plane spanned by
~x1 and ~x2 . If we delete ~x2 from Figure 1 and redraw
the orthogonal projection, we will obtain the answer
as shown in Figure 2.
According to the basic assumption mentioned
above, the problem/search space of the diagrammatic version of this problem is assumed to be
smaller than the problem/search space of the formula version. The solution with vector diagram,
consequently, should require less computation than
the conventional solution. Note that in both solutions we started with the definition of R. In general,
diagrammatic approaches often require less computation than conventional approaches (Cheng, 1992).
Other than the small problem/search space of the
diagrammatic solution, the concreteness of diagrammatic operators also can contribute to finding the
answer to this problem. In contrast, the formula version of the definition of R and its transformation are
more abstract with no diagrammatic meaning, and
the solution is a pure algebraic solution. Cheng and
Simon (1995) pointed out that conventional mathematical approaches are often more complex than
diagrammatic approaches because the bulk of the
reasoning must center around abstract equations.
We therefore predict that a group of students
which uses a vector diagram to solve this problem
will show better performance than another group of
students which tries to solve it in a conventional way.
In this study, after trying to solve the problems,
the students read the correct solution and evaluated

Figure 2: The answer to Problem 1 with vector diagrams

the degree of their understanding (to what degree
they could understand the solution) and the degree
of their conviction (to what degree they could accept
it) on a 5-point scale. In Problem 1, we can expect
some differences in these scores in accordance with
the difference in difficulty of problem solving. However, there may be no difference in these evaluations
between the two groups of the students. Even if
it is difficult to make a long sequence of appropriate operators by their own efforts, just following the
correct sequence may not be a tough task as long as
the students are familiar with these operators.
Problem 2 This problem was chosen in this study
to show that the limited number of diagrammatic
operators, which is the property of vector diagrams
considered to make Problem 1 easy, can also be a
hindrance in problem solving. Among diagrammatic
operators one can find in mathematics textbooks, I
assume that the decomposition of a vector is relatively difficult to use for students because the pair of
vectors that would be generated does not exist in the
current problem state. If a diagrammatic solution of
a problem requires students to use the decomposition operator, the correct solution path is likely to
be outside of the search space, although this path is
in the problem space. A crucial difference between
the vector solutions of Problem 1 and 2 is in whether
the correct solution path is within the search space
or not, although some other differences remain uncontrolled. This experiment puts the external validity above the internal validity, and it is difficult
in this kind of practical study to strictly control all
factors.
In many conventional textbooks, the correlation
coefficient is explained with a scatter diagram. In
the case of Problem 2, two points will be plotted on
the scatter diagram. The regression straight line is
uniquely specified because two points define a unique
line. For this problem, the comparison is not diagram vs. algebra but vector diagram vs. conventional way.
A vector diagram which can be used to solve this
problem is shown in Figure 3. The vector ~x lies at

(y1 , y2 )

(ȳ, ȳ)

right angles to the vector (x̄, x̄); the vector ~y lies
at right angles to the vector (ȳ, ȳ). Students could
find these spatial relations by drawing a diagram
of concrete data chosen arbitrarily or by calculating the inner product. The fact that the vector ~x is
parallel to the vector ~y means that the vector ~y is
described as α~x where α is a scalar. Note that this
solution needs only one kind of diagrammatic operator: Participants need to decompose each of (x1 , x2 )
and (y1 , y2 ) into two vectors as shown in Figure 3.
Our prediction is that the difficulty of using the
decomposition operator will impair performance of
the students. It is also expected that these students
will have trouble in understanding and accepting the
correct solution because the decomposition would be
outside of the search space. This is contrary to the
case of algebraic solution of Problem 1 because all
problem states in this solution are expected to be
included in the search space.
Problem 3 This problem was chosen to use in this
experiment to show that the abstractness of algebraic solutions can sometimes help problem solving.
Recall that it is thought that this property of formulae would make difficult the algebraic solution of
Problem 1.
A conventional solution to this problem consists of
a sequence of simple transformations of the equation
defining the regression coefficient:

Japan, most of the undergraduate students learn algebra
and vectors in high schools. This means they are ready
for learning statistics either by conventional method or
by an alternative, diagrammatic method.

The transformations used in this solution look very
formal and it is difficult top
find any concrete meaning
in them. For example,
Syy is forced to be put
into the formula but this looks like a manipulation
without any concrete meaning.
This problem represents a class of problems which
could not be solved by purely diagrammatic thinking; rather, it requires heterogeneous inference, recruiting both diagrammatic and algebraic representations. Figure 4 shows a vector diagram which

this problem.

(xi − x)2 and b =
(yi − y)2 are put
into the equation r = cos θ = ab , we will obtain the
correct answer. The diagram gives some concrete
meaning to this solution (the second basic assumption in this study mentioned above).
The prediction is that the students who use a
purely algebraic approach will show better performance than the students who try to use a vector diagram. As mentioned in Problem 1, conventional algebraic approaches are often more complex
than diagrammatic approaches because the bulk of
the reasoning must center around abstract equations
(Cheng & Simon, 1995). This study, however, claims
that the abstractness of algebraic manipulation is
not a “bad” property of formulae by nature. Heterogeneous inference requires students to use multiple representations simultaneously and it can burden
students with a cognitive load. A pure diagrammatic
solution, if any, is thought to be easier if this solution is as simple as the algebraic part of the heterogeneous inference.
We can expect some differences in the score of understanding and acceptance in accordance with the
difference in difficulty of problem solving. However,
similar to the case of Problem 1, there may be no difference in these evaluations between the two groups
of students because just following the solution steps
might not be very difficult.

Method
Participants
Participants were 19 undergraduate students majoring in
psychology at Wakayama University, Japan. They had
all taken or were taking a first introductory statistics
course for psychology students, but did not know about
the regression analysis taught in this experiment. In

1324

There were two experimental groups. In formula group,
participants studied the basics of regression analysis in
the conventional way in which formulae were mainly
used. In vector group, the basics of regression analysis were taught with vector diagrams. The participants
were assigned to one of these groups.
Before this experiment, participants received a simple pretest, the purpose of which was to evaluate their
basic knowledge of statistics. This pretest consisted of
five items, which required students to write formulae of
mean, variance, SD, covariance, and correlation coefficient. Students got one point for each correct answer
giving a maximum score of 5 points.
I tried to make sure that the two groups were of
roughly comparable ability. Based on the results of the
pretest, students were divided into nine pairs with one
left over. Paired students’ scores differed by a maximum
of one point. Within a pair, the students were randomly
assigned to one of the two groups. One remaining participant was assigned to the vector group. Thus, the
vector group had 10 and the formula group had 9 participants. The two groups had roughly comparable spread
of ability.

Materials
The text material was written by the author because no
appropriate material was found. Two types of textual
material was used corresponding to the two groups. To
make these two textual materials have the same difficulty
as much as possible, I first wrote the material to be used
in the formula group and then “translated” it into the
text used in the vector group.
Three problems shown in Table 1 were used in this
experiment. All of the statistical concepts that were
needed to solve these problems were explained in the
textual material for both groups. Because of space limitation, I omit the detailed description of the content of
these textual materials.

Procedure
There were two sessions in this experiment: understanding the text material, and problem solving. The experiment was conducted in groups of 3 to 8 participants.
In the first session, participants tried to understand
the text material. If they found a description that was
difficult to understand, they were required to underline
that part in the textbook and to note the reason for the
difficulty in the margin. The participants took about
one hour to finish this session although there was no
time limit.
After reading the text material, each participant reported to the experimenter (i.e. me) their difficulties
in understanding the text. The experimenter gave each
participant additional explanations about the difficult
points in the text. All of the questions were resolved
before the participants proceeded to the second session.
In the second session, the three problems shown in Table 1 were presented one by one. Fifteen minutes were
allocated to solving each problem. Participants were allowed to look at the text material at any time. All participants were given a paper-and-pencil version of the
test.
The participants received the correct answer after they
had finished trying to solve each problem. They were required to evaluate to what degree they could understand

each solution and to what degree they could accept it on
a 5-point scale ranging from 1: “very difficult to understand (or accept)” to 5: “very easy to understand (or
accept).”

Results
Understanding text
It turned out that the two textual materials were
similar in the sense that they had almost the same
difficulty. Column 4 in Table 2 presents the number
of descriptions reported as being difficult to understand in the text for each participant. There was
very little difference in the number of reported difficulties during the learning session between the two
groups in this experiment. The number was 8 in the
formula group and 9 in the vector group.
A closer look at the reported difficulties revealed
that vector diagrams often helped the students in
understanding several points in which the students
in the formula group had a difficulty, while other
obstacles arose with vector diagrams. In the formula group, 5 of 9 participants (N, P, Q, R and
S) said that it was difficult to understand the proof
which showed that the range of correlation coefficient is from −1 to +1. Two participants (O and
S) found difficulty in understanding the reason why
dividing covariance by two standard deviations was
the most proper way to capture the relation between
two variables. One participant (R) said that she
had trouble in understanding where a0 and a1 in
the formula yˆi = a0 + a1 xi came from. In the vector group, all these points were not problematic for
the students. No students in this group reported
any difficulties in understanding the corresponding
points in their textual material. Instead, they had
trouble in understanding other points. Four of the
10 participants (D, G, H, and J) said that they did
not know the concept of orthogonal projection (see
Figure 1). Two participants (G and H) said understanding inner product—which was used in this
group to define correlation coefficient—was difficult.
Two participants (H and I) had difficulty in imagining n-dimensional vectors. One participant said the
equation which describes the relation between the
variance and a vector was difficult.

Problem solving
Columns 5, 8 and 11 in Table 2 present the performance of each participant and success S (%) in
problem solving for each group; F means failure in
problem solving. For each problem, the two columns
to the right of the column indicating success or fail
in problem solving show participants’ self-evaluation
of the degree of understanding and acceptance of
the correct solution presented after their attempt at
problem solving.
All in all, the results supported our prediction.

Problem 1 Vector representations facilitated solution of Problem 1. In the vector group, one participant (Participant F in Table 2) reached the conclusion R = |r| and 5 participants found the answer
R = r in the case of r ≥ 0. All of these students
used vector diagrams. In the formula group, no participant got the answer R = |r| or R = r to this
problem. The difference in success S (%) between
the two groups was significant (Fisher’s exact test,
p = .011).
No significant difference was found in the selfevaluation scores for understanding and acceptance
of the given correct solution.
Problem 2 and 3 In contrast to the good performance on Problem 1, no participant in the vector
group succeeded in solving Problem 2 and Problem
3. The participants in the formula group showed
relatively good performance. The difference in success S (%) between the two groups was significant
in Fisher’s exact test, p = .003 for Problem 2 and
p = .011 for Problem 3.
The scores for understanding and acceptance of
the correct solution to Problem 2 in the vector group
were lower than the scores in the formula group. The
differences in means between the two groups were
significant, t(9.0) = 5.28, p = .001, for understanding; t(17) = 3.15, p = .006, for acceptance.
There was no significant difference in the scores of
the two groups for understanding and acceptance in
Problem 3.

Discussion
The limited number of diagrammatic operators can
make the problem space smaller, and raise the probability of reaching the correct answer. We predicted
that this property would improve performance on
Problem 1 and the results supported this prediction.
Formulae allow students to do many kinds of manipulation. For example, in Problem 1, participant
1
R tried
P to get R × r and participant M considered
{1/n

(xi −x̄)(yi −ȳ)}2
.
R

Note that it is next to impossible to do these manipulations on a vector diagram.
If a diagram rules out these messy manipulations, it
must be a big help for students.
Interestingly, the same property, namely, affording
a small number of operators, could prevent students
from finding the solution and understanding an explanation. This is the case in Problem 2. No participant in the vector group succeeded in solving this
problem. The participants also had trouble in understanding and accepting the correct answer to this
problem. After the experiment, participant A told
me that understanding the decomposition of vectors was difficult, especially, (x̄, x̄) and (ȳ, ȳ) looked
strange. This feedback suggests that the students
were likely to rule out the decomposition operator
necessary

to solve this problem. The low ratings for understanding and acceptance of the correct answer refute
the possibility that the inability to solve this problem means that the participants carelessly failed to
apply a familiar operator.
Similar to the case of properties of diagrams, a
property of formulae can be either an advantage
or a disadvantage. Abstractness is an example of
such properties. This property was predicted to
work against solving Problem 1 but to be an aid
in solving Problem 3 in the formula group. The
results of the experiment were consistent with this
prediction. A formula and its transformation become more concrete when they are connected to a
diagram. This is the case in heterogeneous inference,
inference that use both diagrammatic and algebraic
representations. A pure diagrammatic solution is
easier if this solution is as simple as the algebraic
part of the heterogeneous inference.

Conclusion
Previous research on diagrammatic reasoning has
pointed out many “good” properties of diagrams
and has claimed advantage for diagrammatic approaches over conventional (usually algebraic) approaches. From the results presented here, it seems
that the story is not so simple. The results of this
experiment indicate that the vector diagram is not a

1326

panacea for students struggling with statistics. The
same property of certain diagrams or formulae can
be either an advantage or a disadvantage. Teachers
should keep this in mind and ponder how properties
of diagrams or formulae can work in a particular situation.
