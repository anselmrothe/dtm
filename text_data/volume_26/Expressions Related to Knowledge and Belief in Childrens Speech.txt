  nature (bias-toward-disbelief). It is the truth (true). That is completely false (false). We need to know whether it is
  true or false (truth-value). His claim was bizarre (proposition). I believe what you are saying (belief). I didn’t know
  about that (unknown). I used to think like you do (revealed-incorrect-belief). The assumption was widespread
  (assumption). There is no reason to think that (unjustified-proposition). There is some evidence you are right
  (partially-justified-proposition). The fact is well established (justified-proposition). As a rule, students are generally
  bright (inference). The conclusion could not be otherwise (consequence). What was the reason for your suspicion
  (justification)? That isn’t a good reason (poor-justification). Your argument is circular (circular-justification). One of
  these things must be false (contradiction). His wisdom is vast (knowledge). He knew all about history (knowledge-
  domain). I know something about plumbing (partial-knowledge-domain). He’s got a lot of real-world experience
  (world-knowledge). He understands the theory behind it (world-model-knowledge). That is just common sense
  (shared-knowledge). I’m willing to believe that (add-belief). I stopped believing it after a while (remove-belief). I
  assumed you were coming (add-assumption). You can’t make that assumption here (remove-assumption). Let’s see
  what follows from that (check-inferences). Disregard the consequences of the assumption (ignore-inference). I tried
  not to think about it (suppress-inferences). I concluded that one of them must be wrong (realize-contradiction). I
  realized he must have been there (realize). I can’t think straight (knowledge-management-failure). It just confirms
  what I knew all along (reaffirm-belief).
