Abstract

5-year-olds will succeed on the majority of trials. Call &
Tomasello (1999) demonstrate that these results are
consistent across verbal and non-verbal versions of this task.
Children’s developing performance on the false-belief
task is particularly interesting when couched within the
larger debate concerning maturation and. conceptual change
in cognitive development. Like every other cognitive ability
that emerges in childhood, performance on Theory of Mind
tasks is likely due to a complex combination of maturing
innate abilities and knowledge learned through experience.
Still, understanding the relative importance of these two
factors may have some utility in evaluating two types of
cognitive process models that have been proposed to
account for human Theory of Mind abilities.
First, Theory Theory hypothesizes that Theory of Mind
abilities are computed by prediction and explanation
mechanisms by employing representation-level knowledge
about mental attitudes (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997; Nichols
& Stich, 2002). Second, Simulation Theory argues that
Theory of Mind abilities are computed by imagining that
you are in the place of the other person, then inferring their
mental states by monitoring the processing that is done by
your own cognitive abilities (Goldman, 2000). With respect
to the development of Theory of Mind abilities in children,
each of these theories would emphasize different things as
most important. Theory Theorists would argue that the
acquisition of mental models of commonsense psychology
would play the most important role, a view consistent with a
conceptual change model of development (e.g. Bartsch &
Wellman, 1995). In contrast, Simulation Theorists would
look instead for a maturational change that enabled children
to take the perspective of other people or in the monitoring
of one’s own mental state, a view consistent with a
modularity model of development (e.g. Scholl & Leslie,
2001).
One approach to investigating this issue is to look for
evidence of the acquisition of mental models of
commonsense psychology in the language that children use
in everyday conversation. The contemporary view of natural
language understanding and generation presupposes that the
meaning of verbal expressions are representational in
nature, and that these underlying representations are the
same ones that would be manipulated for the purposes of
inference (e.g. explanation and prediction). By tracking the
production of children’s speech that references
commonsense psychology concepts, we can look for some
correlation between linguistic competency with
commonsense psychology concepts and emerging Theory of
Mind abilities.

Children develop certain abilities related to Theory of Mind
reasoning, particularly concerning the False-belief Task,
between the ages of 3 and 5. This paper investigates whether
there is a corresponding change in the frequency of linguistic
expressions related to knowledge and belief produced by
children around these ages. Automated corpus analysis
techniques are used to tag each expression related to
knowledge and belief in a large corpus of transcripts of
speech from normally developing English-learning children.
Results indicate that the frequency of expressions related to
knowledge and belief increases steadily from the beginning of
children’s language production. Tracking of individual
concepts related to knowledge and belief indicates that there
are no clear qualitative changes in the set of concepts that are
expressed by children of different ages. The implications for
the relationship between language and the development of
Theory of Mind reasoning abilities in children are discussed.

A Developing Theory of Mind
Among the most interesting of human cognitive abilities are
those concerning how we understand and reason about the
minds of others. The term Theory of Mind is used
pervasively throughout the cognitive sciences to refer to the
set of abilities that enable people to reflect introspectively
on their own reasoning, to empathize with other people by
imagining what it would be like to be in their position, and
to generate reasonable expectations and inferences about
mental states and processes.
Within the research area of developmental psychology,
Theory of Mind has been studied as a set of cognitive
abilities that progressively emerge in children. A standard
experimental instrument for studying children's Theory of
Mind abilities is the false-belief task. In a standard version
of this task (Wimmer & Perner, 1983), the child is
introduced to two characters, Maxi and his mother. Maxi
places an object of interest into a cupboard, and then leaves
the scene. While he is away, his mother removes the object
from the cupboard and places it in a drawer. The child is
then asked to predict where Maxi will look for the object
when he returns to the scene. Success on this task has been
criticized as neither entirely dependent on Theory of Mind
abilities nor broadly representative of them (Bloom &
German, 2000), however its utility has been in reliably
demonstrating a developmental shift. Wellman et al. (2001)
analyzed 178 separate studies that employed a version of
this task, finding that 3-year-olds will consistently fail this
task on the majority of trials by indicating that Maxi will
look for the object in the location to which his mother has
moved it. 4-year-olds will succeed on half the trials, while

The application of these local grammars to text documents
produces an annotated text, where each English expression
that is recognized as referencing a commonsense
psychological concept is tagged. The following paragraph
(from William Makepeace Thackeray’s 1848 novel, Vanity
Fair) provides an example of the output of the application
of this lexical-semantic resource.
Perhaps [partially-justified-proposition] she had
mentioned the fact [proposition] already to Rebecca, but
that young lady did not appear to [partially-justifiedproposition] have remembered it [memory-retrieval];
indeed, vowed and protested that she expected [a d d expectation] to see a number of Amelia's nephews and
nieces. She was quite disappointed [disappointmentemotion] that Mr. Sedley was not married; she was sure
[justified-proposition] Amelia had said he was, and she
doted so on [liking-emotion] little children.
The tag set that is being used in this lexical-semantic
resource was developed first through the large-scale analysis
of strategies, defined as the abstract structural
commonalities that exist between analogous planning cases
(Gordon, 2002). 635 concepts resulting from this analysis
(grouped into 30 representational areas) were related to a
Theory of Mind, which constitutes the broadest cognitive
science specification of a representational Theory of Mind
to date. Gordon & Hobbs (2003) describe how this tag set is
modified through the process of examining the breadth of
English language expressions that are related to a given
representational area, among the 30 in the complete set.
Gordon et al. (2003) describes the process of constructing
local grammars for each of the concepts in the revised tag
set, encoded as finite-state transducers, and describes an
evaluation to determine the effectiveness of this approach at
automatically recognizing every English expression that
refers to the concept tag in written text.
One of the 30 representational areas described in this
previous work, Managing Knowledge, specifically deals

In this paper, we explore the progressive use of
expressions that reference commonsense psychology
concepts in children’s language. The approach that we take
in this investigation is to employ automated corpus analysis
techniques developed within the computational linguistics
research community, where the aim is to construct computer
programs to reliably recognize every possible way of
expressing a concept within a given language. In using
automated corpus analysis techniques, we were able to
quickly analyze each of the datasets within the CHILDES
linguistic corpus (MacWhinney, 2000) that contained
transcriptions of normally developing, monolingual Englishlearning children.
The specific interest that we had in conducting this
research concerned the acquisition of a linguistic
competency for concepts related to knowledge and beliefs,
as they are the most relevant to the false-belief task
described earlier. By examining the correspondences
between these linguistic competencies and the ages in which
children acquire cognitive competencies in Theory of Mind
tasks, our aim is to provide an additional point of evidence
that can be used in arguing for or against the competing
models of the cognitive processes that underlie these
abilities.

The Theory of Mind in Language
The Theory of Mind in Language project at the University
of Southern California is an effort aimed at developing a
large-scale lexical-semantic resource for the automated
annotation of commonsense psychological concepts
expressed in English text. This resource is being authored as
a set of local grammars, encoded as finite-state transducers
that can be applied to large text corpora for concept-level
tagging and markup. Associated with each unique concept
tag in the resource is a local grammar that has been handauthored with the aim of recognizing every possible way
that the concept could be expressed in the English language.

Managing knowledge (37 concepts)
He’s got a logical mind (managing-knowledge-ability). She’s very gullible (bias-toward-belief). He’s skeptical by
nature (bias-toward-disbelief). It is the truth (true). That is completely false (false). We need to know whether it is
true or false (truth-value). His claim was bizarre (proposition). I believe what you are saying (belief). I didn’t know
about that (unknown). I used to think like you do (revealed-incorrect-belief). The assumption was widespread
(assumption). There is no reason to think that (unjustified-proposition). There is some evidence you are right
(partially-justified-proposition). The fact is well established (justified-proposition). As a rule, students are generally
bright (inference). The conclusion could not be otherwise (consequence). What was the reason for your suspicion
(justification)? That isn’t a good reason (poor-justification). Your argument is circular (circular-justification). One of
these things must be false (contradiction). His wisdom is vast (knowledge). He knew all about history (knowledgedomain). I know something about plumbing (partial-knowledge-domain). He’s got a lot of real-world experience
(world-knowledge). He understands the theory behind it (world-model-knowledge). That is just common sense
(shared-knowledge). I’m willing to believe that (add-belief). I stopped believing it after a while (remove-belief). I
assumed you were coming (add-assumption). You can’t make that assumption here (remove-assumption). Let’s see
what follows from that (check-inferences). Disregard the consequences of the assumption (ignore-inference). I tried
not to think about it (suppress-inferences). I concluded that one of them must be wrong (realize-contradiction). I
realized he must have been there (realize). I can’t think straight (knowledge-management-failure). It just confirms
what I knew all along (reaffirm-belief).

with the concepts surrounding knowledge and belief,
including assumptions, contradictions, justifications, logical
consequences, truth, falsehood, and the mental processes
associated with these commonsense psychological entities.
Gordon et al. (2003) describe 37 concept tags associated
with this area, which is presented here in Figure 1. The
evaluation described in this previous work indicated that the
lexical-semantic resources associated with this specific
subset of the tag set was effective at identifying 83.92% of
the expressions associated with these tags in English written
text (recall score), and that 92.15% of the tagged
expressions would be judged as appropriate by a human
rater (precision score).

age of 5 years (60 months). Although the available data
should allow for the observation of some interesting trends
throughout the age range of the corpus, some caution is
necessary when drawing strong conclusions about children
older than 60 months.
In order to enable comparisons between children and
adults, each of the analyses were also conducted on the
CALLHOME American English Speech data collected and
transcribed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (1997). The
CALLHOME database consists of transcripts of 120
unscripted telephone conversations (302,083 words)
between native speakers of English, where the callers
average 38.875 years in age (σ=16.14).
Given these text corpora, two sets of analysis were
conducted. Both of these analyses involved the use of tag
frequency as data points. To compute tag frequency, the
local grammars described in the previous section were
applied to a corpus in order to find every expression within
the corpus that should be tagged with the concept associated
with each local grammar. The number of tagged expressions
was then divided by the number of words that were searched
to compute each frequency data point. In the first analysis,
the frequency of all expressions of the 37 concepts related to
knowledge and belief were tabulated for each of the
datasets. In the second analysis, the frequencies of
expressions related to each individual concept (of the 37
total) were tabulated.
No attempt was made to filter the results of the
application of the local grammars to improve precision, and
no evaluation was conducted to estimate the recall rate on
these corpora. However, after reviewing the resulting tags
we believe that the precision and recall scores obtained on
these corpora are only marginally less than was achieved in
the evaluation of written text tagging conducted by Gordon
et al. (2003) using the same set of local grammars.

References in the CHILDES Corpus
As a corpus of analysis, we utilized the CHILDES database
of children’s speech (MacWhinney, 2000), a collection of
transcripts from a wide variety of psycholinguistic studies
conducted largely in the 1980s. Specifically, we analyzed
the transcripts from the 42 research studies that contributed
data of normally developing monolingual English-learning
children.
To facilitate the analysis of this dataset according to the
age of the children, individual files were generated
containing only the transcripts of speech produced by a
single child for each of the transcript files (a total of 3001
individual files). The total number of words in each file was
calculated and the age of the child (in months) was
recorded. There were 3,347,340 words transcribed in these
files from children ranging in age from 11 to 87 months.
Figure 2 presents a histogram of the number of words in
the files associated with each age of the children. The
notable spike that appears in this figure is due to a large
dataset that exists within the CHILDES database contributed
from a study by Hall et al. (1984). The groups of children
are collectively identified only as being between the ages of
54 and 60 months without differentiation, so all of this
dataset was used for evidence at the low end of this range.
More significantly, Figure 2 reveals that comparatively little
data exists within the CHILDES corpus of normally
developing monolingual English-learning children after the

Frequency of all expressions related to knowledge
The first analysis that we conducted was to apply all of the
local grammars for the 37 concepts related to knowledge
and belief to each of the data files corresponding to children
of different ages. In all, there were 18,283 tags produced

Age of children (months)

Figure 3. Frequency of all expressions related to knowledge and belief by age of children
through the application of these local grammars, with only
19 of the 37 tags appearing in the data. Nearly half of these
tags were for the concept of a justified proposition (9113
tags), while the remaining half was dominated by tags to the
concepts of belief (3150 tags), contradictions (3485 tags),
and partially-justified propositions (1483 tags).
Applying the full set of local grammars to the
CALLHOME data set produced 6775 tags, yielding a
frequency of 2.24 reference per 100 words of speech. 21 of
the 37 tags were assigned to this data, with the highest
frequencies going to the concepts of justified proposition
(3172 tags), contradiction (1551 tags), belief (1000 tags),
and partially-justified proposition (493 tags).
Figure 3 presents a graph of the frequency per 100 words
of speech for all expressions related to the concepts of
knowledge and belief based on the age of the children (in
months) of the analyzed data. As a point of comparison, the
frequency for the CALLHOME data (2.24) is also indicated
on the graph as a dashed horizontal line. The data on the

graph can be described by the linear function y=0.0281x –
0.3914, where the correlation statistic (r2) is 0.7021.
The results indicate that expressions related to knowledge
and belief do not appear at the beginning of children’s
speech production, but increase in frequency in a strongly
linear manner from 30 months (2.5 years) until 48 months
(4 years), when the frequencies of these expressions are
roughly half of what is observed in adult conversational
speech.

Frequency of expressions of individual concepts
In the second analysis, we individually applied each of the
19 local grammars that produced at least one tag in the
corpus to each of the transcript data for children of different
ages. The primary purpose of this analysis was to track the
relative increase in frequency for each concept over the
developmental period where a change in Theory of Mind
abilities is evident (between 36 and 60 months of age).

Figure 5. Frequency of expressions of the 5 most frequent individual concepts by age of children
Figure 4 presents a chart of the results of this analysis.
Each concept is listed with the total number of tags assigned
in the corpus and frequencies of occurrence within the data
sets for 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 month-old children,
along with the CALLHOME frequency for the concept.
Figure 5 further describes the results of this analysis by
charting the growth in frequency of expressions related to
the 5 most frequent concepts tagged in the corpus (addassumption, belief, contradiction, justified-proposition, and
partially-justified-proposition) between the ages of 24 and
60 months.
The results indicate that the increases in overall frequency
of expressions related to knowledge and belief can be
attributed to a steady increase in expressions related to a
handful of concepts, particularly the concepts of belief,
contradiction, and justified-propositions. This steady
increase begins at 24 months and continuing past 48
months, when the frequencies of these expressions are
roughly half of what is observed in adult conversational
speech evidenced by the CALLHOME corpus. There is no
evidence of any qualitative change in the sorts of concepts
related to knowledge and belief that are expressed by
children of different ages.

started at the beginning of their speech production. The
sparse data that we have for children older than 60 months
suggests that this gradual increase begins to level off after
this point. If we had seen a non-linear shift in the
frequencies of expression between 3 and 5, then an
argument could have been made relating linguistic
competency to Theory of Mind abilities. Finding no such
shift, one could reasonably infer that the developing
linguistic competencies that children have for expressions
related to knowledge and belief are unrelated to their
reasoning abilities in Theory of Mind tasks.
Second, there is no evidence to suggest a qualitative
change in the concepts that children express related to
knowledge and belief between the ages of 3 and 5. Looking
at the individual frequencies for each of the 19 concept tags
that were assigned to the corpus we see that the handful of
concepts that account for the vast majority of tags increase
in frequency at a constant rate from the very beginning of
children’s speech production. Very few expressions appear
in this data related to other concepts that appear with
slightly higher frequencies in adult discourse, and there is
no evidence that linguistic competency is acquired for these
concepts during this period of time either. If we had seen a
change in the concepts that were being expressed between 3
and 5, then a different argument could have been made
relating linguistic competency to Theory of Mind abilities.
Finding no such change one could again reasonably infer a
lack of a direct relationship between language-use and
acquired reasoning abilities.
Together these two points argue against a strong
relationship between linguistic competencies for expressions
related to knowledge and belief and children’s developing
Theory of Mind abilities. This argument is particularly
important in evaluating cognitive models that assume that
Theory of Mind abilities and language abilities are enabled
by representational mental models of the same type. If we
assume that the sophistication of children’s representational
theories of knowledge and belief is closely related to the
way that children express these concepts in language, then

Discussion
The overall purpose of this study was to determine the
relationship between a linguistic competency in the
production of expressions related to knowledge and belief
and children’s developing Theory of Mind abilities,
particularly during the age range where children acquire
competency on the false-belief task (between 3 and 5 years
in age). In this section, we will consider the results of our
analysis with respect to this purpose.
First, there is no evidence to suggest a qualitative change
in the frequencies that children express concepts related to
knowledge and belief between the ages of 3 and 5. Looking
first only at the frequency of all expressions related to
knowledge and belief we see that children between the ages
of 3 and 5 are continuing a steady increase in frequency that

there is little evidence to suggest that these representational
theories change at all between ages of 3 and 5, when
competency on the false-belief task develops. Accepting this
assumption, the evidence in this paper would argue against
any strong conceptual change account of Theory of Mind
abilities where competency on the false-belief task is due
solely to the acquisition of more sophisticated
representational mental models. This evidence would argue
instead for a maturational account, where competency on
the false-belief task can be attributed to the development of
new cognitive abilities for taking the perspective of other
people or in the monitoring of one’s own mental state
between the ages of 3 and 5. One strong counterargument
that could be made against this line of reasoning concerns
the differences in the linguistic competencies between
language production and language understanding. In
analyzing transcript data consisting of words uttered by
children, this study can make no claims regarding the
linguistic competency that these children might have for
understanding expressions related to knowledge and belief
during the relevant periods of development.

Conclusions
The availability of large corpora of transcripts of children’s
speech production has afforded researchers the opportunity
to investigate a wide variety of issues related to language
acquisition. This paper has demonstrated that specific issues
related to the acquisition Theory of Mind abilities can also
be addressed using these corpora. By employing automated
techniques for the tagging of expressions related to
commonsense psychology we have been able to efficiently
analyze data sets that are larger than could have been
reasonably tackled given limited resources.
The specific interest of this paper was to determine if
there was evidence for change in the linguistic competency
in expressions related to knowledge and belief during
developmental periods associated with acquired competency
in the false-belief task (between 3 and 5 years of age). By
using automated corpus analysis techniques, expressions
related to knowledge and belief were identified across all
datasets within the CHILDES corpus containing speech
from normally developing monolingual English-learning
children. By charting the frequencies of these expressions at
different ages, it is evident that children steadily increase the
frequency of expressions related to knowledge and belief at
a constant rate from the beginning of their speech
production. By tracking the production of expressions
related to individual concepts, no qualitative changes in the
conceptual content of these expressions over time is evident.
These results argue against a strong relationship between
linguistic competencies for expressions related to
knowledge and belief and children’s developing Theory of
Mind abilities.
