we have studied to date, most appear to be collaborating,
producing speech at a relatively slow rate (but faster
than some of the slowest speakers’ natural reading rate).
We have not yet (in over 60 pairs of speakers) found a
speaking pair in which one speaker consistently lagged
behind the other. Rather, they seem to genuinely speak
together, with a high degree of synchrony.
                Phrasing and Pauses
One of the first properties of Synchronous Speech we
noticed, was that phrasing, i.e. the division of a long
stretch of speech into intonational units separated by
pauses, appeared to be much more consistent in Syn-
chronous Speech than in control readings done alone.
In an initial pilot with 4 speakers, we found that in 48
‘solo’ readings, pauses occurred at points other than ma-
jor expected phrase breaks 48 times (Cummins, 2002).
By contrast, in Synchronous Speech, there were only 4
such idiosyncratic pauses in 24 paired readings.
   These findings have been extended in the studies of
pauses in Synchronous Speech (Zvonik and Cummins,
2002; Zvonik and Cummins, 2003), who found that inter-
speaker variability in pause duration was greatly reduced
in Synchronous Speech, compared with ‘solo’ speech.
The reduced variability allowed the identification of a
quantitative relationship between pause duration and
the length (in syllables) of the preceding phrase—a re-
lationship which was obscured in the rather more vari-
able solo data. Specifically, we found a restricted dis-
tribution of clauses of less than 300 ms length. These
pauses were far more likely to occur when the preced-
ing phrase was relatively short (less than 11 syllables
long)1 . We examined pause duration in readings by 6
speakers (3 pairs) of 19 short texts (13 distinct authors).
Table 1 shows the proportion of pauses in each environ-
ment (preceding phrase long or short, following phrase
long or short) which were below 300 ms. The preponder-
ance of short pauses in an environment following a short
phrase is clear.
