   Visual illusion can be strengthened or weakened with the ad-
   dition of extra visual elements. For example, in Poggendorff
   illusion, with an additional bar added, the illusory skew in the
   perceived angle can be enlarged or reduced. In this paper, we

Visual illusions are important phenomena because of their po-                                                         α

nation can be sufficient, but when multiple effects exist in an
illusion, the final percept can be quite complex. For exam-                             1

trains of cell 1 and cell 2. The three bars below are input duration to the three cells. As demonstrated in the figure, when position 3 is lighted,
neurons at position 2 get inhibited by 3, so its ability to inhibit others get reduced. As a result, the firing rate of neuron at position 1 gets
increased during the time neuron at position 3 is excited. This effect is called disinhibition. Redrawn from (Hartline and Ratliff 1957).
