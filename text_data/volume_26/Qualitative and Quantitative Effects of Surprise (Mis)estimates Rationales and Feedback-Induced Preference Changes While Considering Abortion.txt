Estimates and Initial Preference/Policy
Participants greatly underestimated the abortion rate. The
median estimate was 5,000 abortions per million live births
(M=50,479; S.D. = 148,469), much less than the true––and
often evocative––rate of 335,000. (Due to high variance, we
focus more on median estimates, as they usually inform
more than do means.) In general, students’ initial numeric
preferences differed from what they thought the true rate to
be (i.e., there was, overall, a significant difference between               Figure 1: Distributions of general preference ratings
