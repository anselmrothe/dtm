Simulation Design Four conditions were created by
crossing two factors: (1) the number of sounds that
diphthongs denote (one, two), and (2) languages (English,            Figure 4. Average Euclidian Distance for predicting sounds

   Another finding of note was that a strong syllable
structure emerged in Mandarin Chinese even when supra-
segmental (tone) information was not considered. This
suggests that the segmental syllable, i.e. the syllable without
the tone, has statistical support in the input, and may
function as a processing unit. Psycholinguistic studies of
Mandarin support this hypothesis. For instance, analysis of
natural speech errors indicated that sometimes a syllable
moves to a new location, leaving its tone behind (Chen,
2000). That is, the slipping unit was a segmental syllable.
Pan, Chen, and Chen (1999) demonstrated this effect with
experimentally generated slips. Furthermore, implicit
priming and masked priming findings are robust both for
syllables with tones and for segmental syllables (Chen,
Chen & Dell, 2002; Chen, Lin & Ferrand, 2003).
