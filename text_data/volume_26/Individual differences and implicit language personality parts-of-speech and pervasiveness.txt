Abstract
Dewaele and Furnham predict that in oral language
Extraverts prefer to produce what they term implicit language. They use: more pronouns, adverbs
and verbs; and fewer nouns, adjectives and prepositions. However, communication in a computermediated environment, such as e-mail, might disrupt these preferences. Also, other personality dimensions, such as Neuroticism, may be related to
implicitness. The study exploited an existing corpus of e-mail texts written by native English speakers of known personality. Stratified corpus comparison used n-gram-based techniques from statistical natural language processing, to compare relative
frequencies of use of (sequences of) parts-of-speech.
Implicitness effects were found, and Neuroticism appeared to have a clearer impact than Extraversion.

Personality and language
Individuals differ in the way they speak and write.
Some of those differences are systematic, and can
be attributed to apparently deeper differences, such
as personality traits, like Extraversion and Neuroticism. Extraversion is a trait strongly related to
interpersonal interaction and sociability, whereas,
Neuroticism, or Emotional Stability, is related to
internal emotional states, rather than interaction.
In the past, it has been found that both these personality traits do significantly influence an individual’s language production behaviour in a variety of
contexts (Pennebaker and King, 1999; Dewaele and
Furnham, 1999). Recent work has investigated email text, and suggested that there are characteristic
sequences of words and punctuation associated with
each end of both dimensions (Extravert or Neurotic)
(Gill and Oberlander, 2002, 2003).
However, Mehl and Pennebaker (2003) note that
linguistic style is more consistently described by its
syntactic component, than by content. So, it could
be that the relative use of different parts-of-speech
(POSs) is a more important indicator of personality
than the relative use of words or strings of words.
The work by Dewaele and Furnham suggests that,
at least for Extraversion, there are real effects to be
found in spoken language, at the level of POSs. In
their account, implicit language involves a preference
for pronouns, adverbs and verbs, whereas explicit

1035

language involves a preference for nouns, adjectives
and prepositions. Heylighen and Dewaele (2002)
suggest that Extraversion leads to implicitness due
to greater visual-spacial capacities, and this is part
of an overall preference for informal language. However, this work leaves open whether or not implicitness effects will be found for Neuroticism. Gill and
Oberlander’s work suggests that formality may also
be a factor in Neurotic language behaviour, because
the reduced resources of high Neurotics do not enable detailed language planning. But that work did
not investigate implicitness in patterns of POS use.
It would therefore be interesting to know whether
Dewaele and Furnham’s ‘Implicit-Extravert hypothesis’ applies in the genre of e-mail text—a genre close
to spoken language—and if so, how.
To address this question, the rest of this paper
is structured as follows. First, we give some background to help frame implicitness hypotheses that
gives POS predictions for both Extraversion and
Neuroticism. We then present the stratified corpus comparison methods used in analysing POS use
in the e-mail corpus. Results were somewhat unexpected, in that implicitness predictions appear to be
confirmed for Neuroticism, but not for Extraversion.
We discuss possible ways of resolving the issue.

Background
Two personality traits
Extraversion and Neuroticism are traits which are
common to the two major trait theories of personality: Eysenck’s three factor model (Eysenck and
Eysenck, 1991); and the five factor model developed
by Costa and McCrae (Costa and McCrae, 1992)
and others.
They are described as follows: High Extraverts
are said to be sociable, easy-going, and optimistic,
and to take chances. Low Extraverts (or Introverts) are said to be quiet, and reserved, and to
plan ahead, and dislike excitement. High Neurotics
are said to be: anxious, worrying, over-emotional,
and frequently depressed. Low Neurotics are said to
be: calm, even-tempered, controlled, and unworried
(Eysenck and Eysenck, 1991).

Dewaele and Furnham
Furnham (1990) has proposed the following features
of Extravert and Introvert language. Extravert language: is less formal; has a more restricted (rather
than elaborated) code; uses vocabulary more loosely,
where this is defined in terms of how correctly
words are used, and how unusual they are. And
it uses more verbs, adverbs and pronouns (rather
than nouns, adjectives, and prepositions). This last
tendency directly involves POSs. Using factor analysis of syntactic tokens produced by L2 speakers,
Dewaele and Furnham (2000) describe implicit language as a preference for pronouns, adverbs and
verbs, and they contrast it with explicit language,
seen as a preference for nouns, modifiers and prepositions. So Extraverts prefer implicitness, and Introverts prefer explicitness. For the purposes of this
paper, we shall term this the Implicit-Extravert Hypothesis. The hypothesis appears to hold in both informal and formal situations, and is consistent with
previous analyses of the individual linguistic categories (Dewaele, 2001). Cope (1969) also notes a
lower lexical diversity (measured as type-token ratio), for Extravert native French speakers, with this
also the case for non-native speakers of English (Dewaele and Furnham, 2000).
However, although they have discussed varieties
of anxiety and their effects on communication, Dewaele and Furnham have not attempted to predict
which part-of-speech patterns might be characteristic of the related trait Neuroticism. What might we
expect to find?

An extension: Implicit-Neuroticism
Previous work by Gill and Oberlander (2002, 2003)
gathered a corpus of e-mail messages, and analysed
it for characteristic words and sequences of words.
The corpus comprised 210 texts produced by 105
University students or recent graduates (37 males,
68 females). Each participant composed two e-mails
to a good friend whom they hadn’t seen for quite
some time, spending around 10 minutes on each
message. The first e-mail concerned their activities
in the past week, the second discussed their plans
for the next week. The total corpus size is around
65,000 words.
Following analysis of occurrences of individual
words, and sequences of words, it was reported that
the corpus results on Extravert words were broadly
consistent with previous findings, for instance using informal language, looser punctuation, vaguer
quantification and more co-ordination. This therefore appears to fit the Implicit-Extravert hypothesis;
however, no POS analysis was reported.
However, there were also results on Neurotic language use. Pennebaker and King (1999) previously
argued that High Neuroticism was associated with a
language factor for ‘Immediacy’. Gill and Oberlander (2003) extended these results, suggesting that

1036

‘High Neurotics show a preference for forms occurring frequently in speech, for example, I, and, that,
rather than less common words such as abject, suspicion, tether. This preference for common words contributes towards the very low lexical density found
in highly Neurotic texts, demonstrated by the high
level of repetition over ten-word sections of text.’
What is interesting about this is that it suggests
that Dewaele and Furnham’s ideas about formality
and implicitness might be as relevant to the Neuroticism dimension as they are to the Extraversion
dimension. If they are, then we would expect that—
like High Extraverts—High Neurotics will use more
verbs, adverbs and pronouns, while Low Neurotics
will use more nouns, adjectives, and prepositions.
We call this the Implicit-Neurotic Hypothesis (INH).
It obviously raises the question of whether or not
both dimensions are related to implicitness, and the
relative strength of any connections.
To address this question, we here apply to the
existing e-mail corpus a series of techniques to derive
POS frequencies, and POS sequences.

Syntactic Analysis of the Corpus
Method
The personality corpus was acquired as described
above. It was tagged using the Penn part-of-speech
tagset, using the MXPOST tagger (Ratnaparkhi,
1996). Further processing removed the original
words, leaving their associated POS tags. A subsequent stage of processing reduced the POS tags from
the detailed Penn tagset to more general syntactic
categories. The 45 Penn tags (see Marcus, Santorini,
and Marcinkiewicz, 1994, for more details) were converted to 10 broader categories, as implemented in
the electronic version of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary which is incorporated into the MRC
Psycholinguistic Database (Wilson, 1987). These
are: Noun (nn), Adjective (adj), Verb (vbn), Adverb (adv), Preposition (prp), Conjunction (conj),
Pronoun (prn), Interjection (int), Past Participle
(vpp), and Other [syntactic categories] (o). In addition to these categories, we also make use of hpi
indicating punctuation, and ‘NA’, which indicates
that a feature does not belong to any of the above
categories and generally represents the hENDi, end
of text marker. Note that here we use a different
set of labels to enhance intelligibility, and these do
not co-incide exactly with those used in the MRC
database: for instance, we use ‘prp’ instead of ‘R’.
The reduced-tag corpus—with the more general
syntactic categories—was then divided into stratified sub-corpora. In stratifying, we isolate a ‘reference corpus’ of text from authors with a personality profile which is not extreme on any of the measured dimensions. We can then compare authors
from each of the extreme personality groups with
this ‘neutral’ (here termed ‘mid’) group. Thus, High

and Low personality group samples were created by
splitting them at greater than 1 standard deviation
above and below the EPQ-R score for each dimension. The additional requirement was made that authors had to be within 1 standard deviation on the
dimensions other than the one for which they were
extremely high or low. Additionally, all texts which
were within 1 standard deviation across all personality dimensions were assigned to the personality ‘neutral’ Mid sub-corpus. Thus, on any dimension, we
have three groups to compare (High, Mid, and Low).
The resulting sizes of the subcorpora are as follows: Around 6,000 words for the high Extraversion,
and over 2,000 words for the low Extraversion groups
(11 and 4 authors respectively); Over 3,000 words for
the high Neurotic and around 6,000 words for the
low Neurotic groups (6 and 9 authors). The Neutral
group was around 10,000 words (23 authors).
To identify collocations in the tagged sub-corpora,
we calculate 1–5 word n-grams, and do not use a
rank or frequency cut-off during calculation, but
only present features with a frequency ≥5. This
enables an accurate log-likelihood statistic (G2 ) of
their occurrence between groups to be calculated (cf.
Rayson, 2003). We use N-gram software (Banerjee
and Pedersen, 2003) to compute G2 for 2- and 3grams. To identify those robust collocations which
distinguish one group from another, we need to make
a three-way comparison of the linguistic features
across the high-mid-low corpora for each group. We
calculate the relationships between the three groups,
and for each feature in each corpus we identify its
frequency and relative frequency, and then where relevant its relative-frequency ratio and log-likelihood
between High-Low, High-Mid and Low-Mid groups.
This allows us to compare the relative usage and
statistical significance of the difference in the use of
features between groups.

Results
We first report the results of the unigram analysis for
Extraversion and Neuroticism dimensions, we then
report the findings of the overall n-gram analyses
(1–5 item sequences). Following this, the results for
Extraversion and Neuroticism are outlined.

Unigram Syntactic Analysis
Results of the unigram analysis for the reduced set
of syntactic tags can be found in Tables 1 and 2. We
display the results for all tags present in our data;
however G2 values which achieve significance of p ≤
0.05 or p ≤ 0.01 are noted by ∗ or ∗∗ respectively.
In this presentation of the results, we draw attention to features which are characteristic of the
High or Low groups, compared with the usage of
the feature more generally. In the tables, we distinguish whether a feature is under- or over-used by
one of the three groups (High, Mid or Low), relative
to the two other groups; this information is given

Figure 1: Summary of unigram POS analysis
in the final three columns of each table, with overuse indicated by + and under-use by −. However,
a more concise view of the results can be gained
in the following way. At least two kind of features
can be associated with (say) High Neuroticism: unigrams which are over-used by High Neurotics; and
unigrams which are under-used by Low Neurotics.
Thus, Figure 1 lists, for each dimension and each
sub-group, the features which are associated with
that group either via their over-use of the feature,
or an opposite group’s underuse.
For Extraversion, conjunction (conj) is characteristic of High Extraverts, and past participle verbs
(vpp) of Low Extraverts. The Mid Extravert group
shows no significant under- or over-use of the general tags. For Neuroticism, conjunction (conj) and
pronouns (prn) are characteristic of High Neurotics,
and adjectives (adj) and nouns (nn) of Low Neurotics. The Mid Neurotic group shows no significant
under- or over-use of the general tags.
For these results, we note the generally modest
levels of significant differences we found between personality groups. We may take this to indicate that
these groups generally use relatively similar proportions of the relevant parts of speech. However, the
POSs may also occur in different contexts or sequences, thus indicating differences in they way they
are used. We therefore turn to the results of the ngram analysis of the syntactic tag data.

N-gram Syntactic Analysis
There is insufficient space to display the full results.
A concise view is therefore given in Figure 2. Notice
that for the Mid groups, we have to distinguish features labelled specifically as under-use, since this is
of course relative to both the High and Low groups.
The features here reach much higher levels of significance than the unigrams, so here we only discuss
those which reach the critical value of 10.83 (i.e.,
p ≤ 0.001). 32 n-gram features reach this value for
Neuroticism, and 25 for Extraversion. Of these, the
majority in each case reach the 15.13 critical value
(p ≤ 0.0001): 23 and 17, respectively. The features reaching this higher value are predominantly
bigrams, exceptions being the longer n-grams for

Table 2: Reduced syntactic tag unigram analysis, Neuroticism.
Note. ∗p < .05, ∗ ∗ p < .01, df = 1.

punctuation found for Neuroticism. In interpreting
this data, we seek distinctive POS collocations. Table 3 shows, for each sub-group, how many distinctive collocations involving each POS were found.
Extraversion From the unigram analysis, we are
particularly interested in collocations involving conjunctions (for the High E group) and past participle
verbs (for the Low E group). As far as conjunctions
are concerned, High Extraverts are associated with
the use of [conj vbn] and [conj adv], while Low
Extraverts are associated with the use of [conj vbn
prn]. The latter offers a particularly distinctive collocation, since the pronoun switches the preference
from High to Low E. Turning to past participles, we
find that High E prefer [vpp prp], but there are no
preferred collocations for Low Extraverts.
Given Table 3, the remaining discrepancies between the High and Low E groups are as follows.
Allowing that there are substantially more distinctive collocations for the High E group overall, we
find that the High E group has notably more collocations involving: punctuation, adjectives, nouns,
and POSs in the Other category. The Low E group
has notably more collocations involving verbs and
pronouns.
Neuroticism Here, we are most interested in collocations involving pronouns and conjunctions (for
the High N group) and adjectives and nouns (for
the Low N group). Taking pronouns first, we find
a High Neurotic preference for [adj prn vbn], [adj
prn] and [vbn prn o]. Turning to conjunctions,

1038

they also show a preference for [vbn adj conj].
Three of these collocations also involve adjectives,
which are used overall more by Low Neurotics. However, the rest of High N preferences for collocations involving pronouns instead involve adverbs:
[vbn prn o adv vbn], [vbn prn o adv], [prn
vbn prn o adv] and [adv prn vbn prn]. While
Low Neurotics have only one pronoun collocation
involving an adjective—[prn adj]—the other three
of their preferred pronoun or conjunction collocations also involve adverbs: [prn adv], [adv prn]
and [conj adv].
Given Table 3, and allowing that there are rather
more distinctive collocations for the High Neurotic
group overall, we find that the High Ns have notably more collocations involving verbs, and POSs in
the Other category. The Low Ns have notably more
collocations involving: past participle verbs and adverbs.

Discussion
Dewaele and Furnham’s original Implicit-Extravert
Hypothesis predicted that in spontaneous speech
High Extraverts will use more verbs, adverbs and
pronouns, and that Low Extraverts will use more
nouns, adjectives, and prepositions (see Heylighen
and Dewaele, 2002, for a discussion as to why certain POSs are preferred by Extraverts). The unigram analysis did not support these predictions. It
indicated that High E use more conjunctions, and
that Low E use more past participle verbs. No other
overall differences were found, although it is perhaps

High Extraverts [conj vbn] [nn nn] [adv hpi] [prn

[adv vpp] [prn adj] [vpp prp]

Figure 2: Summary of n-gram POS analysis

worth noting that since we have both past participles and general verbs, our categories are slightly
more fine-grained, which may affect the result.
The new Implicit-Neurotic Hypothesis predicted
that High Neurotics will use more verbs, adverbs
and pronouns, and that Low Neurotics will use more
nouns, adjectives, and prepositions. The unigram
analysis partially supported these predictions. It
found that High N use more pronouns (and conjunctions), and that Low N use more nouns and adjectives. However, no overall differences were found for
verbs, adverbs or prepositions.
At first glance, then, it appears that the Neuroticism dimension is more closely related to implicitness than the Extraversion dimension, in this corpus

of e-mail text. Two potential explanations emerge
to explain the difference between this and Dewaele
and Furnham’s results: Firstly, they were studying spoken, rather than written, language; and secondly, that they were largely dealing with L2 speakers. Perhaps implicitness is more closely related to
Neuroticism in written language, and for Extraversion in spoken language; likewise it may have different effects for native and non-native language users.
However, before following this line of reasoning, we
should also consider the results of the n-gram analysis. At least two gross patterns are interesting.
First, where a High and Low group do not differ
overall in the relative frequency of use of a POS,
one group may have rather more types of distinctive collocation involving that POS than the other
group. If overall use does not differ, it means that
one group is using the POS in many different contexts; the other may be using it in a narrower, or
perhaps more stereotypical, range of contexts. Let
us call the greater-range case ‘pervasive’ use. Secondly, where a High and Low group do differ in relative frequency of use of a POS, it is interesting to
note whether higher frequency is associated with a
greater set of collocations involving that POS, or a
smaller set. Intuitions here are not firm; but we
might expect that greater relative frequency is associated with a greater range of use—and hence, with
perhaps fewer stereotypical collocations. If so, frequency may track pervasiveness.
So, consider again the original Implicit-Extravert
Hypothesis: High Extraverts will use more verbs,
adverbs and pronouns, and Low Extraverts will use
more nouns, adjectives, and prepositions. We find
that High E prefer conjunctions overall, but that it
is the Low E who tend towards POS-collocations involving verbs and pronouns. So High E use of verbs
and pronouns may not be not greater overall, but it
is pervasive. Equally, Low E prefer past participle
verbs overall, but it is the High E who tend towards
POS-collocations involving nouns, adjectives, punctuation, and the Other category. Perhaps Low E use
of adjectives and nouns is pervasive. And since Low
Extraverts actually use proportionately more vpp,
their complete lack of distinctive robust collocations
suggests that they use vpp pervasively.
Now, let us turn to the new Implicit-Neurotic Hypothesis. High Neurotics will use more verbs, adverbs and pronouns, and Low Neurotics will use
more nouns, adjectives, and prepositions. We find
that High N prefer pronouns and conjunctions overall, but that it is the Low N who tend towards POScollocations involving past participle verbs and adverbs. So perhaps High N use of past participle verbs
and adverbs is pervasive. Equally, Low N prefer adjectives and nouns overall, but it is the High N who
tend towards POS-collocations involving verbs and
the Other category. And again, perhaps Low N use
of verbs and Other is pervasive.

This pattern is not quite so simple as the Extravert case, and this may in part be because we
have split the verb category in two, distinguishing
past participle verbs from verbs in general. Putting
this to one side, however, we do find High N use of
adverbs to be pervasive; and this at least fits the
picture of pervasiveness that seemed to be emerging
with Extraversion.

Conclusion
This paper set out to establish whether Dewaele and
Furnham’s Implicit-Extravert Hypothesis for oral
language applies in the genre of written e-mail text
produced by native English speakers.
At the simple unigram level, it appears that Neuroticism rather than Extraversion fits the implicitness predictions concerning frequency of use of partsof-speech. However, we can drill down to the collocations level, and we may assume that the pervasive
use of a POS tends to reduce the likelihood of finding stereotypical collocations involving it. If we do,
then Extraversion does involve implicitness after all.
On this interpretation, a POS can be characteristic of some personality group not because they use
it more frequently than other groups; rather, it is
characteristic because they use it more pervasively.
Applications of this work include affective text
categorisation, and therefore could contribute towards the rapidly expanding field of sentiment classification. In taking this work further, we need to give
the idea of pervasiveness a more solid basis. But this
is only worth pursuing if the idea is really needed to
explain the data. And we will only know this once
we have tested the hypotheses against larger corpora
in other domains. The corpora could be brand new;
but it would certainly be possible to apply the analytic techniques presented here to other previously
gathered personality corpora.
