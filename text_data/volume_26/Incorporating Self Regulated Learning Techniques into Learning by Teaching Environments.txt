the combination of the two can help students not only learn

   Implementing Learning by Teaching Systems
  Our teachable agents (TAs) provide important structures
to help shape the thinking of the learner-as-teacher. Each
agent manifests a visual structure that is tailored to a spe-
cific form of knowledge organization and inference. In
general, our agents try to embody four principles of design:
• Teach through visual representations that organize the
   reasoning structures of the domain (e.g., directed graphs                      Figure 1: Betty’s Brain Interface
   and matrices).
                                                                      Once taught, Betty reasons with her knowledge and an-
