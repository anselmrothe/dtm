   As in our previous study, Indonesian and English
speakers were shown a series of pictures: the three kinship
standards (as exemplified in the top picture in Figure 2) and
their three corresponding family pictures (Figure 1), along
with 21 other pictures (a total of 27 pictures). For each
picture, participants were asked to describe the scenes and
remember them for a later memory task. After a brief filler
task, participants were given a recognition memory test. As                                         Standard
