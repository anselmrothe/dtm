and real-world tasks, in particular language acquisition (e.g.,
Saffran, Aslin & Newport, 1996; Christiansen & Ellefson,
2002; Lupyan, 2002; Saffran, 2003). AGL can be used for
studying the kinds of structural regularities that children
discover while learning language (Saffran, 2003). The goal
of this work has mostly involved exploring learning under
passive observational exposure. Indeed, these experiments
have demonstrated the richness of statistical learning under
such circumstances.
However, language acquisition does not take place in a
social vacuum. Instead, children are acquiring their native
language while interacting with both people and things in
the environment (e.g., Snow, 1999; Chouinard & Clark,
2003; Moerk, 1992; and even before two-word production;
see Tomasello, 2003, for a review). In this context, and
others in the natural world, relevant sequential behavioral
structure has a function or serves a purpose, socially or
otherwise, and its acquisition is immersed in this interactive
context. What kind of information in the environment, and
possible mechanisms in the learner, can supplement passive
exposure to sequential structure in order to obtain a
competence over what is to be learned? This paper presents
a first step toward identifying one such dimension of
learning. By using an AGL procedure, we explore the role
of one kind of feedback that may be present in language
acquisition.
We first offer a brief summary and review of this source
of feedback in language acquisition. The potential for
exploring this dimension is then presented in two
experiments, demonstrating how an interactive task can
bring a learner to a strong level of competence. In addition,
we demonstrate that detailed aspects of an artificial
grammar can be acquired in the context of feedback. We
end with a discussion of implications, especially in view of
language acquisition, and future directions this research may
take.

Abstract
Language is immersed in a rich and active environment. One
general dimension of that environment, feedback, may
contribute greatly to learning language structure. Artificialgrammar learning offers an experimental means of exploring
different kinds of potential feedback. In this paper, two
experiments sought to investigate the role of feedback in an
artificial-grammar learning task designed to resemble some
aspects of language acquisition. An artificial language
composed of auditory nonsense syllables and an
accompanying visual semantics were created. Participants
faced the task of mapping a sample sentence to a visual
semantic scene. Results indicated that feedback is highly
useful, allows participants to reach a high level of competence
in the language, and also helps the acquisition of detailed
aspects of the artificial grammar. Implications for language
acquisition are discussed, and future directions considered.

Introduction
That humans can learn without any direct feedback has been
well established for decades. From basic information
extraction in perceptual processes (Gibson & Gibson, 1955),
to social facilitation of a choice task (Bandura & Mischel,
1965), it seems that learning can occur passively and
observationally across multiple levels of cognitive
complexity.
One particular area of research with similar findings has
been that of implicit learning or artificial grammar learning
(AGL; Reber, 1967), in which subjects become sensitive to
the regularities of a simple artificial grammar through
passive exposure to sample sentences. A considerable
amount of this research has been directed towards
uncovering the mechanisms of this learning (e.g., Reber,
1967; Reber & Lewis, 1977; Vokey & Brooks, 1992;
Redington & Chater, 1996; Cleeremans, Destrebecqz, &
Boyer, 1998; Pathos & Bailey, 2000).
Learning through passive exposure to these grammars,
however, is usually defined as performance at above-chance
levels. Therefore, to gain further insight into language
acquisition, theoretical and empirical bridges are needed
between what may be called passive structural learning in
these cases and the natural world, in which a learner
acquires a firm competence with sequential structures in a
meaningful, interactive context (e.g., see Berry, 1991, for an
investigation of action in learning a probabilistic system). In
pursuit of this, some research has been guided by questions
about the possible connections between this kind of learning

Feedback in Language and AGL
Although the child may not be told explicitly that a given
utterance or word is incorrect (also referred to as the lack of
“negative feedback”; Saxton, 1997), the child does get other
types of evidence or feedback.1 For example, a mother may
1

For simplicity, we do not consider the difference between
negative feedback and negative evidence, though the distinction is
important and may be explored by the experimental means
presented here. See Saxton, 1997, for further discussion.

ask her child to pick up a particular toy, say a little plastic
pig, from among several other toys. When the child
successfully picks up the right toy, the mother may
emphatically repeat the name of the target object: The pig!
Yes, that's the pig. Once the child chooses the right toy, the
mother repeats the label (e.g., the pig) and thus provides
positive feedback on the child’s correct mapping of the
linguistic label to the appropriate object. Although there is
considerable and continuing debate on the cultural
variability of such practices (see Lieven, 1994, for a review
and discussion), it is nevertheless possible that feedback of
this nature may be present and useful in language
acquisition (e.g., see Peters and Boggs, 1986, for a
discussion of interactional routines across cultures).
Here we take a first step toward assessing the potential
usefulness of such feedback in an AGL task meant to model
the learning of sequential structure and how it maps to the
non-linguistic world – a task not unlike what the child faces.
It should be noted that the role of feedback in language
acquisition is highly controversial (see, for example,
Morgan, Bonamo & Travis, 1995; Valian, 1999; Moerk,
2000; Saxton, 1997, 2000). It has perhaps for this reason not
been extensively investigated in AGL research, where the
focus has been on training techniques that largely parallel
the kind of passive input considered central during language
acquisition. Nevertheless, the role of feedback is widely
acknowledged in such areas as skill acquisition (Moerk,
1992), learning theory (Rescorla, 1968), and reinforcementlearning models (Sutton & Barto, 1998).
There are therefore two primary objectives of the
following experiments. A basic empirical objective is to
consider the influence of feedback on AGL in a training
procedure that resembles a natural-world context. To meet
this goal, an experimental paradigm has been designed to
resemble a kind of task faced by the child during language
acquisition, adapted from Lupyan (2002; also, see Billman,
1989 and Morgan, Meier & Newport, 1987 for similar
techniques).
Another objective is primarily theoretical: How does
learning sequential structure get immersed in an interactive
context and lead to competence? These experiments
approach one aspect of an answer by considering how
interactive feedback in a sequential learning task might
bring the learner to a competent level of performance.

noun) was instantiated by a set of nonsense syllables (e.g.,
voop or jux; see Table 1).
An elementary visual “semantics” was created for this
language. Each noun was randomly assigned an animal
referent, and each verb had as its “meaning” a simple shape.
Each nonsense syllable in the language had a referent of this
kind in the visual semantics (Fig. 2).
Although the extent to which the visual scene contains a
“subject” or “object” or “verb” is abstract, the language and
its semantics are meant to capture structure-world
correspondences not entirely unlike what might be seen in
natural language structure.
Fifty random sentences were constructed for the
experiment, and an incorrect visual semantic scene for each
sentence was created (see Figs. 3 and 4). This incorrect
scene was paired, as a foil, with the correct scene in
training, as described below.

Procedure In every trial, participants saw two visual
semantic scenes side by side then heard a sample sentence
from the grammar. Their task was to select the appropriate
visual semantics for the sentence heard. The task therefore
involved learning the sequential structure of the grammar,
and learning to map each sound to its semantic animal or
shape.

Method
Participants 51 college students were recruited for extra
credit. Participation required approximately 20 minutes.
Materials A simple artificial grammar was created for the
experiment, illustrated in Figure 1. Each category (e.g., N,

subjects were not informed about the meaningfulness of the
repetitions (as positive feedback); in a second condition,
subjects were explicitly informed that feedback would
occur.
Out of the four possible subject groups, three were used in
the experiment. One group received no instruction about
the feedback but received it consistently. A second received
no instruction, but the feedback occurred randomly. A third
group of subjects received both consistent feedback and
instructions about the presence of feedback during training.
Performance on the final 10 items of training served as
the measure of learning. These items were new to the
subjects. This permitted observation of performance in a
continuous learning task without interruption. There was
therefore no distinction between training and testing.

No main effect for condition was found (corrected F(2, 50)
= 1.65, p = .21). However, due to the probabilistic nature of
the training phase, an additional planned regression analysis
on each condition was conducted (because, by chance, some
subjects may experience less consistent positive feedback
than others). This was meant to investigate the number of
actual feedback events experienced during the first 40 trials
of training, and how it might predict performance on the
final 10 items.
The only condition that produced a reliable predictive
relationship was that in which subjects received information
about the presence of feedback (r = .65, p < .05). Although
the consistent feedback without instruction condition had a
positive slope, the coefficient was not significant (r = .28, p
= .26).

Discussion
This preliminary experiment offers some important
observations. First, inconsistent feedback present in training
did indeed stultify learning, even when the subjects were not
certain about the significance of the sentence repetitions.
We may tentatively contend that even contingent events in

A positive feedback event was defined as a repetition of
the sentence when the participants selected the appropriate
visual semantic scene.
Two feedback conditions were investigated. Some
subjects received only consistent feedback, occurring with
50% probability on any correct trial. Other subjects
received 40% random repetitions, not contingent on the
correctness of their selection (these probabilities were
chosen so that all participants heard approximately the same
number of repetitions).
Two further conditions were defined in terms of the kinds
of instructions provided to subjects. In one condition,

repetitions).
Given the results of the first experiment, it seems that
salience of such feedback is a crucial property of using it in
the task. To enhance this effect, we added a feature to the
feedback event: When a correct visual scene was selected,
the incorrect scene would be removed and the sentence
would be repeated to the participant. This served to make
these events as informative as possible to the participants.
Also, this event may bear some resemblance to social
interaction between the child and caregiver. When the child
correctly interprets a lexical item, the caregiver may
emphasize its referent object, thereby focusing the child’s
attention on it.
Following this training procedure, 30 trials were
presented to participants without feedback in either
condition. Performance on these 30 items served as the
basic comparison between groups (consistent vs. random
feedback), and item analyses allow us to investigate the role
of feedback in acquiring more detailed aspects of the
grammar (e.g., verb argument structure).
An additional control condition was conducted in which
participants only experienced the test phase of the
experiment.

the learning environment can help or hinder learning
sequential structure. It was not the case that learners simply
ignored the repetitions and extracted the sequential
invariants across the training trials.
Second, when participants were informed about the
presence of feedback, the repetitions served as significant
elements of acquiring the structure. It appears that subject
performance became highly reliant upon even occasional,
contingent repetitions of sentences as positive feedback,
especially when the feedback was made meaningful to
subjects. There is evidence that perceiving the import of
such events may have an important influence on language
acquisition (Saxton, 1997; Tomasello, 2003).
Despite these positive results, the learning that took place
in the experiment hardly exhibits competence of the kind
described in the introductory discussion. We therefore
conducted a second experiment to address this and other
questions. First, we enhanced the salience of the feedback
event by changing the training environment. Second, we
devised a separate test phase to explore the learning of
specific kinds of structures in the grammar. Finally, we
tracked learning of the grammar over time to observe the
effect of feedback across training.

Experiment 2
Results

Experiment 2 changed the nature of the feedback event to
render it more salient. This involved not merely repeating
the sentence, but also changing the visual environment
selected by the participants. In addition, we explored how
participants learned different aspects of the grammar, such
as the abstract verb-argument structure.

A main effect of condition (positive feedback, random
feedback, control) was found (F(2, 31) = 7.1, p < .01).
Subsequent comparisons among the groups indicated that
only the positive feedback condition differed significantly
from the random feedback and control groups (p < .05 in
both cases; see Fig. 6). In fact, participants in the random
feedback condition did not differ significantly from the
control group (p = .28).
We further conducted item analyses within the positive
and random feedback conditions to find wherein their
performance differences lie (see Table 2). A repeatedmeasures ANOVA was conducted over the different kinds
of items within subjects, and found that the primary
differences in performance were in verb exchanges, the
“subject” shape being exchanged, and a marginally
significant result for identifying inversions in the argument
structure of the verbal shapes.
By looking at the overall performance of participants,
graphed over time, we get an interesting illustration of
learning under the condition of consistent feedback (Fig. 7).
The final 4 points include performance during the training
stage.

Method
Participants 34 college-age participants were recruited for
extra credit. Participation required approximately 20
minutes.
Materials The artificial grammar used was the same as in
the first experiment. We created an additional 30 sentences
to be used in a test phase without feedback. The paired
incorrect visual scenes in these test items were constructed
so as to sample across all possible grammatical errors.
These included exchanging nominal shapes with an
incorrect shape, inverting nominal shapes, and exchanging
verbal shapes with incorrect shapes (see Fig. 3 for the kinds
of foils used).
Once again, 50 sentences were presented randomly in a
training phase. Feedback again was defined as a repetition
of the spoken sentence.

Table 2: Number correct on different foils, and
significance of the comparisons

Procedure Similarly to the first experiment, participants
selected one of two visual scenes in response to a heard
sentence of the grammar. This training once again consisted
of 50 trials. Half the subjects received 60% feedback
consistently, the other half hearing random feedback with
50% probability (these were selected once again so that all

Discussion
These results further indicate that the salience of positive
feedback in a sequential learning task of this kind can
strongly influence performance. Participants in this task
were performing almost perfectly in the positive feedback
condition, even in the test phase, during which feedback was
no longer issued.
Moreover, item analyses indicated that even subtle
structure-world correspondences as the idealized “verb
argument” structure in this artificial grammar was being
learned more effectively under the condition of feedback.

Although we feel the current experiments hold considerable
promise, they do have limitations. First, although they more
closely resemble natural-world contexts than previous
research, they are still quite simple. Future experiments will
address this issue by incorporating an even more interactive
experimental task. Second, the grammar itself is quite
simple, and mere passive exposure may be sufficient to
learn it. Experiments are currently being conducted that
directly compare passive exposure to scene-sentence pairs
and the active selection task used here.
These limitations notwithstanding, the experiments have
provided a first step towards investigating how feedback in
an interactive task can bring performance in AGL to a more
competent level than typically observed. The language
acquisition literature itself has been deeply involved in
debate for decades about the nature of feedback and
evidence to children. For example, one may argue that the
issue of positive and negative feedback has been resolved
since Brown and Hanlon (1970), who demonstrated quite
clearly that commonplace conceptions of feedback to a
language learner are incorrect. Nevertheless, many continue
to tease apart the negative and positive function of different
types of input to children (e.g., Saxton, 1997; Saxton, 2000;
Chouinard & Clark, 2003).
The experiments here can contribute to this endeavor.
They may offer empirical means by which different kinds of
feedback and their effects can be investigated
experimentally, albeit here in college-aged subjects. The
technique could be modified for children, and many of its
dimensions explored in experiments with both children and
adults. Some have pursued similar techniques such as
“human simulations” (e.g., Gillette, Gleitman, Gleitman &
Lederer 1999; Snedecker, Gleitman & Brent, 1999). For
example, Snedecker et al. (1999) used college-aged subjects
to explore the role of ambient social and environmental
input to support a noun bias during language acquisition.
This idea is not unlike what is being argued here (see
Snedecker et al. for an interesting exploration and
discussion of feedback in word learning).
More importantly, these experiments are intended to
support a perspective in “ecological” sequential learning,
and particularly language learning, that sees the task facing
a learner as an active and interactive one. We would
contend that such learning cannot only involve passively

Instead, sequential structure in the natural world, linguistic
or otherwise, is used in an interactive environment – these
uses generate consequences in the environment that impinge
upon a learner’s expectations and help carry the learner into
a world of meaningful sequential structure.
