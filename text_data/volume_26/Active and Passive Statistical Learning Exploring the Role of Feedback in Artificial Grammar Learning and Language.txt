considerable and continuing debate on the cultural
variability of such practices (see Lieven, 1994, for a review
and discussion), it is nevertheless possible that feedback of
this nature may be present and useful in language
acquisition (e.g., see Peters and Boggs, 1986, for a
discussion of interactional routines across cultures).
   Here we take a first step toward assessing the potential
usefulness of such feedback in an AGL task meant to model
the learning of sequential structure and how it maps to the
non-linguistic world – a task not unlike what the child faces.
   It should be noted that the role of feedback in language
acquisition is highly controversial (see, for example,
Morgan, Bonamo & Travis, 1995; Valian, 1999; Moerk,
2000; Saxton, 1997, 2000). It has perhaps for this reason not                Figure 2: An example stimulus from one trial
