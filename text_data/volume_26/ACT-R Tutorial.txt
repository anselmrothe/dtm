R 5.0 that is more interruptible, achieves greater across-task
parameter consistency, has better mechanisms of production
learning, and is more in correspondence with our knowledge
of brain function. The tutorial has no prerequisite
knowledge, and is intended to on the one hand give an
overview of the theory, and on the other hand offer some
direct demonstration of ACT-R models. Although a half day
is not sufficient to cover all material, it can wet the appetite
for the full ACT-R tutorial that is available on http://act-
r.psy.cmu.edu/. This website also provides for the necessary
software, and overview of researchers using ACT-R, and it
has a list of ACT-R publications (many of them
downloadable).
During the tutorial, following Taatgen, Lebiere and
Anderson (submitted) five popular research paradigms
within ACT-R will be used as a vehicle to explain the
architecture:
Instance learning
Learning by retrieving old experiences from memory,                             Figure 1: Overview of the architecture
