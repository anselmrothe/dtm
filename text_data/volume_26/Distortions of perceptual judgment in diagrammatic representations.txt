(approx. US $128,688), the UK government developed
the performance monitor (Police Standards Unit, 2003,
20041), a variation of a diagram otherwise known as a
spidergram, radar or kiviat chart. The purpose of the
performance monitor is to present in summary form per-
formance data for individual police forces in five key ar-
eas or “domains” (citizen focus, promoting public safety,
resource usage, investigating crime, and reducing crime)
and to allow easy comparison with average performance
computed from a set of police forces most similar to the
individual force in terms of socio-economic, demographic
and geographic makeup.
