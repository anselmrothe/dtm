An additional consideration that arises when adding the
CNP stimuli is orientation. As previously mentioned, one
factor driving word order in conjoined noun phrases is the
left-to-right bias, with leftmost participants more likely to be
first mentioned. This prediction bore out in the current
norming study as well, with leftmost participants mentioned

52.8% of the time for PV items in prior norming study).
