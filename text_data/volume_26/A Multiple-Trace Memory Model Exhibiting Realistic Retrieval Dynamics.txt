Primacy & Recency
   Primacy and recency are well-known memory phenomena.
When a list is studied, items that appeared early in the study
list are more recallable than items near the middle of the list.
Primacy effects have been attributed to covert rehearsal be-
tween study presentations (Glenberg et al., 1980). Effec-
tively, subjects create extra study opportunities in the gaps
between item exposures.
                                                                       Figure 4: Serial position curves at delays of 0, 30, 90, 150,
