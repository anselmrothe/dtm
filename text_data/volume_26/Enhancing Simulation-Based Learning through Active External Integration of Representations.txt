tions into coherent mental representations, resulting in
fragmentary and disjointed knowledge structures (e.g.,
Ainsworth, Bibby, & Wood, 2002; Seufert, 2003). Accord-
ingly, to facilitate simulation-based learning it seems to be
important not only to support learners in dealing with the
dynamics and the interactivity of the simulations, but also to
help them in relating the dynamically visualized information
to corresponding information of other external representa-
tions.
   To facilitate learning with multiple external representa-
tions it has been repeatedly suggested to present textual and
pictorial information in a spatially integrated format instead
of presenting them separately from each other in a “split-
source” format (e.g., Chandler & Sweller, 1991, 1992;
Mayer, 1997, 2001; Tarmizi & Sweller, 1988). According to
cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988; Sweller, van Merriën-
boer, & Paas, 1998) this can reduce unnecessary visual
search resulting in a decrease of cognitive load and thus
better learning. Another suggested method to support                Figure 1: Active integration of information while learning
