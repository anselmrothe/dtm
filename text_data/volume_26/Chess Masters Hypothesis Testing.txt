Refutation (that is, hypothesis falsification) occurs when the
opponent plays a move that results in a worsening of the
player’s position. For example, a player may play a move
that he or she plans to be a good move, but the opponent
replies with a move that stops the player’s plan. The
opponent’s play worsens the player’s position and reduces
the player’s chance of a win.
 There may be three major processes in the choice of a chess
move: exploration, elaboration and proof (DeGroot, 1965).
Evidence of hypothesis testing is available in the proof
process. A chess player tests how good a move is by
mentally generating move sequences following on from that                   a1
