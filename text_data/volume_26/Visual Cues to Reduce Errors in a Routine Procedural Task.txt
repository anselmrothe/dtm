theoretical analysis of human error is still in its infancy.”
   Over the years, several elaborate models and taxonomies
of human error have been developed for the purpose of
qualitative diagnosis (e.g., Reason, 1990). Although useful
for post hoc explanations, the predictive power of these is
quite limited. Results from controlled studies with various
error “interventions” may extend our understanding of why
such cognitive errors arise, helping us not only evaluate
(post hoc) but also design (predict) safer machines.
Application areas to benefit abound, from aerospace to
medicine.
