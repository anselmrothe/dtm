         Models for Analyzing Concept Maps
We developed four candidate models of the in uence of struc-
tural and layout characteristics on expectations for the im-
portance of particular concepts to the topic of concept maps.
In the models, concepts are represented as nodes in the con-
cept map graph. The baseline model treats map topology and
layout as unimportant. The three remaining models use the
topology of the concept map to compute a weight predicting
each concept’s importance in describing the topic of the map.
   To determine which factors to include in the models, we
  rst considered factors from the concept mapping litera-
ture. Novak proposed that meaningful learning is facilitated
when new concepts or concept meanings are subsumed un-
der broader, more inclusive concepts, which suggests that
concept maps should have a hierarchical structure. All of                                Figure 2: A simple concept map about glaciers.
