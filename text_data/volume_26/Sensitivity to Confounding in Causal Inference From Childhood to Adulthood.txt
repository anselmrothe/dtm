frequency data to make a causal attribution.
  The difficulty in using data to prove that a theory is correct
or incorrect may not be due to student’s inattention to
confounded causes. Instead, it may be that that having to
justify their responses, or an interaction with prior
knowledge is the problem. When introducing children to
the abstract idea of confounding, it may be useful to build of
their intuitions of causal attribution by first having them
make judgments of potential causes of novel effects. Their
