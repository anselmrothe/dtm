in other domains as well. These issues are currently under
investigation.
  In sum, the results suggest that when information is added
to the end of a Target sequence, it is perceived as more
similar to the original Target than if the same information
was added to the beginning of this Target. This was true
across all three domains investigated, suggesting that there
might be a general cognitive mechanism of processing of
temporal information that may underlie the suffixation
preference, which is prominently present in the linguistic
domain.
