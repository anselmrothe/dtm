Procedure
Participants filled out a survey as part of an experimental
session. Instructions specified that the participant’s task was
to make a judgment about how good or how bad certain
words were. It was emphasized to participants that they
should go with their first intuition, and that judgments
should be made according to what they personally thought,
rather than what other people might think.
   The word stimuli were presented in the following manner
(see Figures 1 and 2). Each stimulus was printed on a
separate sheet of paper measuring 4 ¼ by 5 ½ inches. A
horizontal line was drawn in the middle of the paper to
emphasize up and down locations. The stimulus word was
printed either in the space on top of the line (in the upper
half of the page), or below the line (in the lower half of the                              GARBAGE
page). Each word was followed by a rating scale on which                        Very                        Very
                                                                               Good                          Bad
the participant evaluated the word from 1 (very good) to 7                            1 2   3   4   5  6   7
(very bad). All stimuli were assembled into a booklet that
presented the stimuli in a fixed random order. Half of the
stimuli were strongly positive words, the other half were
strongly negative words. These words were selected from a
word list for which normative affective ratings have been
established (Bradley & Lang, 1999), and were matched for
word length and word frequency. For each valence, half of             Figure 2: Spatial set-up of survey: “ Bad” concrete item in

half were concrete (e.g., “ bouquet,” “ thief” ), thus resulting
in eight different experimental conditions. Each stimulus
was presented only once, and each participant received all
conditions.                                                                          Table 3: List of word stimuli.
