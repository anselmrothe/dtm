Stimuli
Sixteen pictures served as the primary visual stimuli. Each
depicted a simple spatial scene and featured both a
horizontally extended figure and a vertically extended
figure, for example, a river extending from top to bottom,
and a fence extending left to right. A further 16 pictures
were used as filler items. All pictures were matched on level
of color luminance.
     Sixteen blocks of recorded English sentences served as
primary stimuli. Each block contained two sentence pairs.
Each pair included a FM-sentence (fictive motion sentence)
and a comparable NFM-sentence (non-fictive motion
sentence), for example, The cord runs along the wall, and
