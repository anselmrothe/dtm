sets of findings suggest that elements may be processed in
an automatic and obligatory manner.
   If this is the case, then elements should be detected even

properties of stimuli, while ignoring others, it seems likely
that children would exhibit these effects under a wider range
of conditions than adults.
   To test these hypotheses, we created a task, in which
participants were asked to focus on a simple relation of
numeric equivalence. We selected this relation because                      Matching Choice                       Mismatching Choice
previous research demonstrated that even primates could
match items having equivalent number of elements,
regardless of what these elements were (Thompson, et al.,
1997). We deemed it reasonable, therefore, that the relation
of numeric equivalence should be available to 4-to-5 year-              Correlated condition
olds. The task (a variant of Garner’s interference task) was
presented as a “matching game,” in which participants were
presented with a Target having a particular number of                                                   Target
identical elements (e.g., two identical shapes), and a Test
item. If the Test item had the same number of elements,
participants should identify it as a match, otherwise they
should identify an item as a mismatch. The items were
presented under three conditions. First, there was a “fixed”                     Matching Choice                Mismatching Choice
condition, in which the Target and Test items had identical
elements, and matching or mismatching relation was the
only source of variance. Second, there was a “correlated”
condition, in which elements and relations varied together: a
relational match accompanied an elemental match, and a
relational mismatch accompanied an elemental mismatch.                     Orthogonal condition
Finally, there was an “orthogonal” condition, in which
relations and elements varied independently. Examples of
items across the three conditions are presented in Figure 1.                                           Target
   If elements are not attended to in the course of relational
processing, there would be no difference in speed and
accuracy of matching across the three conditions. If,
however, elements are processed automatically, there should
be a difference in speed or accuracy between the orthogonal
