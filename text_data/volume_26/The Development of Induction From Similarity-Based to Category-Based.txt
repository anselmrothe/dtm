category-level representations (which might be the case if
induction is category-based), they should poorly distinguish
between Old Targets and Critical Lures.
   Results reported by Sloutsky and Fisher (in press-b)
indicate that young children exhibit high recognition
accuracy for Critical Lures (thus pointing to similarity-
based induction), whereas adults exhibit low recognition
accuracy for Critical Lures (thus suggesting category-based
induction). It has also been demonstrated that adults’
category-based induction results in a decrease in memory
accuracy compared to the Baseline memory tasks, while
young children’s similarity-based induction does not.
   The goal of the series of experiments presented below is
to compare the two theoretical positions by examining the
pattern of development of inductive inference. The
similarity-based position assumes a gradual transition from
similarity-based to category-based induction in the course of
learning and development, whereas no such transition is
predicted by the naïve theory position. According to this                  Figure 1: Examples of stimuli in Experiment 1.

Conclusion
Overall, results of the three reported experiments represent
novel findings indicating that (a) early in development
people spontaneously perform similarity-based rather than
category-based induction; (b) there is a gradual transition
from similarity-based to category-based induction; and (c)
category-based induction is a product of learning. These
results support the similarity-based account of young
children’s induction, while presenting challenges to the
naïve theory approach.
