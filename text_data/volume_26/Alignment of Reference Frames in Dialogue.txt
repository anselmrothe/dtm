Participants 12 students of the University of Edinburgh
were paid volunteers in the experiment, which lasted 20
minutes. All were native English speakers.
Materials The experiment was run on two computers

program was created for the confederate and consisted of
sentences positioned in the centre of the screen of the form
“The dot above the chair”. This formed the script for the
experiment. The second program was for the participant and
