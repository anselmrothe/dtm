to fully understand why delay decreases value.
                          Conclusion
The present studies demonstrate that there is an effect of
delay on the interpretation of probabilities and an interaction
between delay and probability on the value of monetary
outcomes. When delay is longer, probabilities are
interpreted as less extreme, at both higher and lower levels.
Further, mid-range probabilities are weighted less at longer
delays when valuing monetary outcomes, and delay is
weighted very little when probabilities are small, suggesting
that attention is traded off between delay and probability,
depending on the levels of each. Because choices in life
often involve delays and likelihoods less that 100%, it is
worthwhile to explore the way people combine these two
types of uncertainty and, especially for temporal delay, to
gain a better understanding of the roots of delay’s influence
on value.
