   Having found a pro-density effect in previous work, the
current study attempted to determine the robustness of this
effect by establishing a negative correlation between dense
clusters and the probability of a target being located in a
dense cluster. If initial fixations still land on the dense
cluster, this would suggest that the effect is determined by

configural properties. On the other hand, if initial saccades                                                 1. Fixation
