Pomplun, & Williams, 2003; Williams & Reingold,

selectivity.
   In the present study participants performed a visual
search task in the ‘change blindness’ flicker paradigm
(Rensink, O'Regan, & Clark, 1997). As shown in Figure
1, participants were asked to detect a letter (target) that
differed in color (see Panel A) or shape (see Panel B)
across otherwise identical alternating letter arrays. In a                                                          200 ms
subset of trials, there was a covariation embedded in the
task that reduced the target to half of the display items.
Reaction times for the trials containing the covariation
(Covariant trials), were compared to the reaction times                                                    80 ms
obtained for the trials that did not contain covariation
information (Random trials). In addition, half of the
participants were told of the existence of a covariation                          Panel A
                                                                                                    200 ms
(Informed group) and the other half were not notified of
this regularity (Uninformed group). Learning of the
covariation rule would be expressed by faster reaction
times for the Covariant trials than for the Random trials.
In addition, learning of the covariation rule would provide
target identity information and may be manifested as a
bias towards fixating on the letters that have the same
shape or color as the target (i.e., saccadic selectivity).
Finally, we were also interested in determining if there
would be differential search performance across the
Informed and Uninformed groups reflecting qualitative
differences between implicit and explicit learning.
