ordering and progressively larger differences between the
sets at these last two stages. Also there is a trend to-
wards increased discriminability for cousin, featural and
contour sets.
   A change in set order can also be observed at the PCA
and z-score PCA stages for the inverted image results
(not shown in figures here). The configural set shows a
larger inversion effect than the feature set, which is con-
sistent with human data. We also observe an increas-
ing gap between the featural set and the configural set
(f eatural > conf igural) when the local PC’s are intro-
duced and as their proportion is subsequently increased
(as the number of global PC’s is reduced). However, the
contour set is always less discriminable or at most as dis-
criminable as the spacing set, which is the wrong order
– contour should be more discriminable than spacing in
inverted images. The correct ordering shows up in the
hidden layer for all networks except the ones with no
global PCA or no local PCA (see Figure 10), suggesting
that both are needed.
