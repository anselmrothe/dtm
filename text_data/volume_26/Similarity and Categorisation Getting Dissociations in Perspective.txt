Abstract
Dissociations between similarity and categorization have
constituted critical counter-evidence to the view that
categorization is similarity-based. However, there have
been difficulties in replicating such dissociations. This
paper reports three experiments. The first provides
evidence of a double dissociation between similarity and
categorization. The second and third show that by
asking participants to make their judgments from
particular perspectives, this dissociation disappears or is
much reduced. It is argued that these data support a
perspectival view of concepts, in which categorization is
similarity-based, but where the dimensions used to make
similarity and categorization judgments are partially
fixed by perspective.

Introduction
Explanations of categorisation have undergone a
number of theoretical shifts (Medin, 1989), from
classical to prototype models, and from prototype to
theory-based models (e.g., Murphy & Medin, 1985).
One of the key pieces of evidence against similaritybased models has been the finding that similarity and
categorisation judgments can dissociate. For example,
Rips (1989) found that participants judged an unknown
item more similar to a coin yet more likely to be a
pizza; and a bird transformed to look like an insect as
more similar to an insect, yet more likely to be a bird.
Dissociations between similarity and categorization
judgments appear directly to undermine similaritybased models of categorization. Prototype models, for
example, assume that categorisation involves a
similarity comparison between an object and a
prototype in memory (e.g., Hampton, 1995). Exemplarbased models assume that a similarity comparison is
made between an object and sets of exemplars in
memory. In both kinds of model, categorization is
taken to be a monotonic increasing function of
similarity. That is, according to similarity-based
models, it should not be possible for categorization to
increase without a corresponding increase in similarity.
These models thus deny the possibility of two kinds of
change: i) a decrease in categorization accompanied by
an increase in similarity; and ii) a decrease in
categorization accompanied by no change in similarity.
In spite of the evidence and arguments in support of
similarity-categorisation dissociations (henceforth,
SCD), similarity-based models have maintained their

150

appeal. Some of this can be attributed to the apparent
success of similarity-based models in explaining much
categorization data (cf. Hampton, 1998) even if SCDs
remain as recalcitrant cases. But similarity-based
models have also retained their appeal because the
existence of SCDs has been questioned (despite other
apparent demonstrations – e.g., Kroska & Goldstone,
1996; Roberson, Davidoff & Braisby, 1999). Smith &
Sloman (1994), in seeking to replicate Rips’ results,
were able only to produce a SCD when participants
were required to operate in a reflective, rule-based
mode, by giving a concurrent verbal protocol.
Similarly, Estes & Hampton (2002) only obtained a
SCD when using a within-participants design; a
between-participants design failed to show a
dissociation. In contrast, Thibaut, Dupont & Anselme
(2002) obtained SCDs in two experiments. Their
participants were required to learn two artificial
categories, exemplars of which were novel shapes.
They found that participants tended to judge category
membership according to the presence of a necessary
feature, but similarity according to the presence of a
salient characteristic feature.
Thibaut et al.’s results show that SCDs can arise
without participants entering a reflective mode of
categorization. However, they do not demonstrate that
natural (as opposed to artificial) categories give rise to
SCDs. That is, they have shown that participants can
learn and use non-similarity-based categories, but not
that natural categories are not similarity-based.
This paper seeks to add to this debate concerning
SCDs and, more widely, similarity-based models of
concepts by i) attempting to demonstrate a double
similarity-categorisation dissociation; and ii) showing
that such dissociations can be eliminated or diminished
when judgments are given in context or perspective.
Previous work (e.g., Thibaut et al.) has shown that
stimuli defined by the presence of both necessary and
characteristic features may be categorized according to
the necessary feature, and rated for similarity according
to the characteristic feature. Of course, such work also
implies the existence of two kinds of (potentially)
borderline case: (a) an exemplar possessing the
necessary but not the characteristic feature (N+Cí DQG
(b) an exemplar possessing the characteristic but not the
necessary feature (Ní&   $FFRUGLQJ WR WKH UDWLRQDOH
extended by Thibaut et al., exemplar (a) should receive

a high categorisation but low similarity rating, and (b)
should receive a low categorization but high similarity
rating. Together these borderline cases could provide a
double dissociation, and potentially more robust
evidence of SCDs.
This paper also seeks to establish whether SCDs are
context-sensitive. That is, it is possible that in context,
categorization judgments are similarity-based, but that
dissociations arise when categorization and similarity
judgments are elicited in the absence of any specific
context. If so, then the mixed evidence reported in the
literature may stem from minor variations in task
presentation, and it might be possible to retain a
similarity-based model in which the weighting of
features varies with context.

Experiment 1
This experiment sought to establish whether similarity

dissociate for two kinds of borderline case:

and Genetics (G+,Gí ZHUHZLWKLQ-participants factors.

Method
Participants 40 undergraduate psychology students
attending an Open University residential school
volunteered to participate.
Materials Four food categories were chosen based on
previous work (Braisby, 2001): salmon, apple, potato
and chicken. Sixteen scenarios were constructed, as
described below, so that there were four exemplars per
category defined by the presence or absence of
appearance and genetic properties: A+G+; A+Gí
Aí*DQG$í*í7KHIROORZLQJVKRZVKRZVFHQDULRV
were constructed for the category ‘apple’; the first set of
brackets indicates wordings for G+ and GíFRQGLWLRQV
and the second set indicates the A+ and AíZRUGLQJV
“You have just bought an apple from a reputable
retailer. On examining its packaging closely, you find
that it has been genetically modified [but it retains
ALL/so that it has NONE] of the genetic properties
specific to apples. On closer examination, you find that
it [looks, feels, smells and even tastes JUST/does NOT
look, feel, smell or even taste] like an apple.”
Procedure All scenarios were presented and responses
recorded using E-prime (Schneider, Eschman &
Zuccolotto, 2002). Participants were given a practice
example, and then asked to read the 16 scenarios. After
each, participants first judged the category membership
of the exemplar given the category label (e.g., apple),

151

choosing either a Yes or No judgment. They then rated
the exemplar for typicality on a 7-point scale relative to
the category label. The typicality question is taken to
be an index of similarity (cf. Hampton, 1998). Order of
presentation of scenarios was random.

Results
Responses to the categorization question were summed
over the four categories, yielding a scale of 0 to 4; the
typicality question was transformed to the same scale
(high scores imply high typicality and high
categorization probability). Both typicality and
categorization scores were analysed using ANOVA

than Categorisation scores (Typicality = 0.83,
categorisation = 1.65, t(39) = 2.69, p < 0.05).
Both Thibaut et al. and Estes & Hampton found that
SCDs were due to only a subset of participants
dissociatin their judgments.
To examine this
possibility, the number of times each participant gave
dissociated pairs of judgments for the borderline items
was calculated. A dissociated pair of judgments was
defined in terms of differences between typicality and
categorization responses for two borderline items
within the same category, where the differences in the
scores have different sign. For example, a participant
might rate an A+GíDVPRUHW\SLFDOWKDQDQ$í*EXW
categorise the former negatively and the latter
positively. Though the difference in typicality scores is
positive, the difference in categorization will be
negative. Dissociations were also defined to include
cases where participants gave differing categorization
responses to the two borderlines within the same
category, but gave the same typicality judgments. Each
of these types of dissociation undermines the suggestion
that categorization is a function of similarity.
Of the 40 participants, 25 (63%) gave no dissociated
pair of judgments to the four pairs of borderlines with
which they were presented; however, 5 (13%) gave
dissociated judgments to all four pairs of borderlines.

1.73, p = 0.09). Taken together, these findings present
a challenge for similarity-based models, for it should
not be possible for an item A to be more typical than
item B and yet less likely to be a category member than
item B.
It should also be noted that these materials do not
present participants with fantastical transformations or
discoveries. Nor do they tap artificial categories.
Moreover, these data do not provide support for the
idea that dissociations arise only under an especially
reflective mode of categorisation. Response times were
collected for both typicality and categorisation
judgments. Typicality is often taken to be an index of
an initial similarity computation, which can be overridden by a subsequent reflective categorisation.
However, the response times in this experiment provide
no support for this thesis: typicality response times
averaged 5.13 seconds (including the time taken to read
each scenario), yet categorisation averaged 3.86
seconds (again including reading time), a statistically
significant difference [t(39) = 5.40, p < 0.001].
Lastly, though, it should be noted that the
dissociations arise because of a subset of the
participants, corroborating the findings of Estes &
Hampton, and Thibaut et al.
In spite of not supporting similarity-based models,
there is the possibility that categorisation and similarity
judgments may align in context. That is, when in a
specific context, it may be that participants make
similarity-based categorisations, and dissociations arise
only because these judgments are elicited out of
context. The next two experiments sought to investigate
this possibility by eliciting judgments in contexts

Discussion of Experiment 1
Although previous research has claimed evidence of
such dissociations, largely these have been single
dissociations, i.e., items for which categorization points
to category A and similarity to category B. In contrast,
the present research dissociates these judgments in two
ways. First, for A+Gí items, typicality scores are
higher than their corresponding categorization scores.
For AíG+ items, typicality scores are lower than the
corresponding categorization scores. Moreover, A+Gí

properties. Both require participants to adopt a
perspective in making their categorisation and typicality
judgments (cf. Barsalou & Sewell, 1984)

As before, the response patterns of individual
participants were examined to see how many gave
dissociated judgments. Of the 33 participants, 23
(70%) gave no dissociated pair of judgments to the four
pairs of borderlines with which they were presented; no
participants gave dissociated judgments to all four pairs
of borderlines.

Discussion of Experiment 2
Unlike experiment 1, these results provide no evidence
of a dissociation between categorisation and similarity
judgments. That is, the dissociation appears to have
been eliminated by ensuring participants give their
judgments from a specific perspective or context. The
pairwise comparisons support this interpretation.
Critically, the typicality and categorization scores do
not violate the assumptions of similarity-based models:
both A+Gí DQG $í* FDVHV GLIIHU LQ FDWHJRULVDWLRQ
(2.64 and 0.94 respectively, t(32) = 4.29, p < 0.001) but
also in typicality (3.17 and 0.56 respectively, t(32) =
10.12, p < 0.001). Hence the borderlines here do not
provide evidence of dissociation – the increase in
categorization is matched by an increase in typicality.
Experiment 3 seeks to establish whether the salience
of genetic properties can be enhanced sufficiently to
eliminate the dissociation in experiment 1.

19 participants (54%) gave no dissociated pair of
judgments to the four pairs of borderlines with which
they were presented; only 1 (3%) participant gave
dissociated judgments to all four pairs of borderlines.

Discussion of Experiment 3
As in experiment 2, this experiment suggests that the
dissociation between categorization and similarity
judgments reported in experiment 1 can be eliminated
when judgments are given under a specific perspective.
While the pairwise comparisons support this
interpretation, other comparisons suggest that the
perspective has not exerted such a strong influence in
this experiment as in experiment 2. Overall, the
typicality scores do not differ significantly for the two
borderlines cases, A+Gí DQG $í*  DQG 

respectively, p = 0.96); however, the two borderlines do
differ in their categorization scores: 1.03 and 2.09
respectively, t(34) = 2.55, p < 0.05). Hence the
borderlines in this experiment provide evidence
contrary to similarity-based models, i.e., an increase in
categorization is not matched by an increase in
similarity. Nevertheless, relative to experiment 1, the
perspective has served to eliminate the differences in
typicality between the borderlines, even though
differences in categorization remain.

General Discussion
This paper provides evidence to support two main
claims. The first is that similarity and categorization
judgments dissociate for natural categories. The second
is that such dissociations are perspective-dependent.
The data in experiment 1 reflect a double dissociation
between similarity and categorization judgments, and
serve to undermine similarity-based models of
categorization. Though previous research has also
uncovered dissociations, these have been single
dissociations, and there have been difficulties in
replicating those findings. Indeed, suggestions have
been made that such dissociations arise only when
categorization is highly reflective, only when designs
are within-participant, and only for certain participants.
The data reported here contradict the first of these
claims. That is, the categorization judgments obtained
in these experiments have not been sought under a
reflective mode – indeed response times show that
participants take considerably less time to make these
judgments than they do the corresponding typicality
judgments. So, there is little evidence for these
categorization judgments being particularly reflective.
These data confirm previous findings that
dissociations arise because of a minority of participants.

The data do not speak to the claim that dissociations
only arise in within-participant designs, although
Thibaut et al.’s evidence contradicts such a claim.
However, Thibaut et al.’s study arguably shows only
that people can learn artificial categories for which
similarity and categorization dissociations arise, not that
these arise also for natural categories. This study
appears to provide strong evidence that even for
everyday, natural kind categories such dissociations
arise. Moreover, the work presented here does not rely
on identifying features that could be considered
necessary or characteristic, a problem Thibaut et al.
identify in previous work – indeed, the stimuli used
here are defined without reference to particular features.
The second main claim is that by fixing perspective,
dissociations between similarity and categorization
judgments are reduced or eliminated. In experiment 2,
making judgments from a ‘sculptor’ perspective
eliminated the dissociation, whereas it was reduced in
experiment 3.
How might these findings of perspective-dependence
be explained? One possibility is that similarity-based
models should be seen as models of categorization-incontext. Categorization and typicality judgments are
often elicited out of context. Without the constraint of
context, participants may call on different kinds of
information to make the two kinds of judgment. In
other words, models of categorization should first seek
to model categorization-in-context and then attempt to
explicate context-free categorization judgments. One
possibility for such a perspectival account of concepts
allows that categorization is similarity-based, but that
the current perspective fixes the relevant dimensions to
be used in the similarity computation (Braisby, 1998).
Another possible explanation is that in experiments 2
and 3, dissociations do not appear because the
instructions used for categorization and similarity do
not elicit those judgments. For example, it could be
that both sets of instructions actually elicit a
categorization judgment, and participants respond in the
typicality task as best they can given that their judgment
reflects a categorization, rather than an overt judgment
of typicality. However, such an explanation is fraught
with problems – for example, if conventional
instructions do not determine the kind of judgment
people make, then there is no obvious basis for deciding
whether any previous research has really elicited
categorization or typicality judgments.
In conclusion, the data reported here suggest that a
simple similarity-based view of categorization is not
right. However, when context is fixed, then the
similarity-based models may fare much better. What is
needed to augment such models is a mechanism by
which the current perspective or context fixes the
relevant dimensions on which categorizations and
similarity judgments are made.
