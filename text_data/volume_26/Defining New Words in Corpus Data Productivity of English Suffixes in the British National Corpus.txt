Abstract
The present study introduces a method of identifying
potentially new words in a large corpus of texts, and assesses
the morphological productivity of 12 English suffixes, based
on some 78 million words of the written component (books
and periodicals) of the British National Corpus (BNC). The
method compares two corpus segments (created by randomly
sampling at the level of documents within the BNC), and
defines new words as those that are not shared across
segments (segments being interpreted as randomly sampled
speaker groups). The approach taken differs from others in the
literature in that new words are identified irrespective of how
many times a given word is used by the same speaker
(author). A productivity ranking of the 12 English suffixes is
obtained, and the results are shown to be intuitively satisfying
and stable over different sample sizes. With a
psycholinguistic interpretation of the data, implications for the
nature of intuitions about productivity are considered.

Introduction
Morphological productivity is central to the study of word
formation, but it continues to defy a solid, uniform
description (see e.g., Aronoff, 1976; Bauer, 2001; Plag,
1999). The coinage of a “new” word is abundant in our
daily use of language; for example, a person who is being
gossiped about may be referred to as a gossipee, or a used
book may be cleanish. Affixation in English (as in gossip +
-ee
gossipee; clean + -ish
cleanish) is a productive
word formation process, and there is plenty of evidence that
affixes differ in their degree of productivity (e.g., Aronoff,
1976; Bauer, 2001); for example, words can in general be
formed more easily with -ness than with -ity (and thus we
may accept cleanness but not cleanity). The majority of
researchers investigating the issue of productivity are
interested in accounting for varying degrees of productivity,
and several productivity measures have been proposed in
the literature (e.g., Aronoff, 1976; Baayen, 1992, 2001;
Bauer, 2001; Plag, 1999). Assessing the degree of
productivity, however, has proven to be a complex task
(Bauer, 2001): while the consensus seems to be that
capturing the coinage of new words is essential in assessing
productivity, there is an inherent difficulty in defining what
a “new” word is.
Most notable among previous studies is a corpus-based
approach proposed by Baayen (1992, 2001). Based on word
frequency in a large corpus of texts, his productivity
measure is formulated as P = n1/N, where given a particular

affix, n1 is the number of word types with that affix that
occur only once (the so-called hapax legomena, hereafter
hapaxes), N is the sum of word tokens with that affix, and P
is the productivity index.1 P is interpreted as expressing the
probability of encountering a word type with a given affix
that has not been seen in the sampled corpus. Thus, new
words are defined under this measure as “unseen” words in
a corpus. An important characteristic of P is that it is based
on token frequency—N directly refers to a count over
tokens, and a word is included in the n1 count only if it
occurs just once. The measure P, with its focus on hapaxes
as estimators of unseen words, is motivated by the
probability estimation method of Good (1953)—or the
Good-Turing estimation method (Church & Gale, 1991).2
While a dictionary provides another source of data for
quantifying morphological productivity, a corpus-based
approach has many advantages. A large corpus of texts
contains productively formed words that are typically not
listed in a dictionary (e.g., gossipee), and corpus data reflect
how words are actually used (Baayen & Lieber, 1991;
Baayen & Renouf, 1996).
The present study pursues and extends the corpus-based
approach by introducing a new method of identifying new
words and assessing productivity.

Type Frequency and Deleted Estimation
It has been suggested that the type frequency for an affix
(the number of word types with an affix) in a corpus,
represented by V, is inadequate in expressing its degree of
productivity. Baayen and Lieber (1991: 804) point out that
in their reference corpus of 18 million words, the type
frequencies for -ness (497) and -ity (405) do not adequately
express the fact that -ness is intuitively felt to be much more
productive than -ity. They find that the P indices for -ness
(0.0044) and -ity (0.0007) are more in line with linguists’
intuitive estimates for these suffixes. There are, however,
some aspects of the measure P that can be quite counterintuitive. In Baayen and Lieber (1991), for example, the P
index for verbal suffix -ize (0.00007) is substantially lower
1

As is usually the case in a corpus study, the term token refers to
each occurrence of a word, and the term type refers to each distinct
word. For instance, if we have {awareness, fairness, fairness,
sharpness, sharpness}, the token frequency for -ness is 5 (the sum
of all occurrences of -ness), whereas the type frequency for -ness is
3 (the number of distinct words with -ness).

than that for -ity (0.0007). To correctly interpret these data,
we need to take into account the fact that P is dependent on
token frequency, and that verbs and nouns generally differ
in their overall frequency in a corpus (Baayen & Lieber,
1991). Consequently, an across-the-board comparison of
affixes across lexical categories is ruled out.
The view that type frequency in a corpus is problematic
for assessments of degree of productivity holds only if type
frequency alone is examined, for an entire corpus. A use of
type frequency is suggested by Nishimoto (2003) in a
productivity measure that adopts the mechanism of deleted
estimation (Jelinek & Mercer, 1985; see also Manning &
Schütze, 1999: 210–211), a probability estimation method
used in Language Technology. The basic concept
underlying the proposed productivity measure is the crosscomparison of corpus segments to identify word types that
are not shared. The PDE measure, a productivity measure
based on the deleted estimation method, is formulated as:
(1)

PDE =

computationally simple method of separating words into
potentially new words and potentially non-new words.3

Simulation Environment
We will examine the performance of the PDE measure, based
on the written component (books and periodicals) of the
BNC, which offers some 78 million words sampled in 2,688
documents. Each sampled document is randomly assigned
to one of two corpus segments, until each segment has a
specified number of words in total (say, 30 million words).
Documents are sampled without replacement, so no
document is shared by two corpus segments. One simulation
run (i.e., one application of the PDE measure) consists of
creating two corpus segments (as above) and obtaining
values for V, VN, and PDE, based on formula (1).
Table 1 lists 12 English suffixes and 1 non-suffix control
selected for the current study.4 At least one suffix is
included for each major lexical category.

V0AB + V0BA (V0AB + V0BA ) / 2 VN
=
=
V
V A +V B
(V A + V B ) / 2

Table 1: 12 English suffixes and 1 non-suffix control.

Given a particular affix and two corpus segments A and B
(both of some size m), VA is the number of word types with
that affix that are present in segment A, and V0AB is the
number of word types with that affix that are present in
segment A but are absent (unseen) in segment B. VB and
V0BA are defined similarly. Averaging the elements of the
denominator and of the numerator separately, we obtain V,
the total number of word types with that affix in a corpus
segment of size m, and VN (V-New), the number of
otherwise-unseen word types with that affix (unseen being
dependent on the relationship between segments). PDE
expresses the degree of productivity of an affix as the
likelihood that a given word type with an affix will be
unseen, hence potentially new. In addition to V and VN, we
also define VNN (V-Non-New) as the number of word types
with the relevant affix that are seen in both segments, hence
non-new. What is essentially achieved by the PDE measure
is the division of sampled word types (V) into new word
types (VN) and non-new word types (VNN). The relationship
V = VN + VNN holds in each application of the measure.
What are the grounds for associating new words with
words that are not shared by two corpus segments? In the
British National Corpus (BNC), data from unique sources
are sampled in single documents, and thus each document
could be considered to represent a set of words used either
by one speaker (author) or by a few speakers (co-authors).
Randomly distributing these documents into two corpus
segments therefore gives us two groups of randomly
sampled speakers (and the words that they used). Words that
are not used in common by the two speaker groups are more
likely to be new than words used by both groups. Crosscomparing two corpus segments offers a crude yet

The predicted differences in productivity in the last column
of Table 1 are largely based on views expressed in the
literature. We also examine ch#, the word ending of a noun
(as in church), as a presumably unproductive non-suffix
control that provides a baseline for determining whether
suffixes are productive (or unproductive). Different
semantic patterns among words formed with a suffix are
ignored: for example, amputee, absentee, and employee
exhibit different semantic patterns, but they are collectively
treated as -ee words. We do not distinguish words with a
suffix by the class of bases that the suffix attaches to: for
example, -er includes employer (verb base) and islander
(noun base). Ordinal numbers are excluded from -th.
A database of 17,347 word types representing the 12
suffixes and the non-suffix control was compiled, based on
100 million words occurring in the entire BNC. The
database crucially relies on decisions about what constitutes
a word type with a suffix. Most problematic are prefixation
and compounding, which could dramatically increase the
number of word types with a suffix. Removing all prefixes

Nishimoto (2004) offers more detailed exploration of the
mechanism of the PDE measure, by increasing the number of crosscompared corpus segments (speaker groups) to 6.

morphology literature. We focus on suffixes only, as they play a
more prominent role than do prefixes in English word formation.

has some negative consequences, such as encouragement
*couragement or disagreement
agreement.5 On the other
hand, allowing all prefixes does not seem plausible, since
words such as anti-institution that appear to be cases of
prefixation would count as distinct word types with a suffix.
Compounding poses a similar problem, and the issue is
further complicated by the variable hyphenation of words.
In solving this familiar problem, we make use of entries in
the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and Webster's Third
New International Dictionary (WD). All prefixed forms and
compounds are checked against the OED/WD, and any
preceding part of a word that cannot be spelled without a
hyphen in both the OED and WD is removed. As a result,
for example, anti-institution will be treated as institution,
but disagreement will remain as disagreement. With the
assumption that the OED and WD are conservative in
accepting novel word forms, the current treatment
effectively prevents novel cases of prefixation and
compounding from inflating the count of word types with a
suffix. Each word type in the database was inspected to
exclude errors (e.g., misspelled words, words with a pseudosuffix).6 See Nishimoto (2004) for further detail.

Evaluation of Data
Productivity Indices
Table 2 presents mean values for V, VN, and PDE, averaged
over 100 simulation runs, with 30 million words in each of
the two corpus segments required by the PDE measure (i.e.,
the total of 60 million words were sampled in each run). The
suffixes in Table 2 are sorted by their PDE value, to achieve
a productivity ranking.
Suffixes -ish and -ness meet our expectations by being
found at the more productive end of the ranking (although
we might have expected -ness to be more productive than
-ish), and -th and ch# fall at the less productive end. We
consider the PDE index for ch# to arise from processes other
than affixation, such as the coinage of simplex words,
compounding, or some sources of noise including the
occurrence of rare or obsolete words.
Taking ch# as a baseline for determining productivity in
affixation, we find that -th is unproductive. The finding that
-ment is effectively non-productive matches Bauer’s (2001:
8–9) observation that the productivity of -ment has been in
decline so that new -ment words are synchronically rare.

5

Removing dis- from disagreement appears to be undesirable if we
view disagreement as a nominalization of disagree.
6
There are 6,797 rules defined for these corrections (mostly
generated automatically, but some inevitably defined manually for
cases such as “dona-a-a-ation”
donation). The number of rules
is large, but it must be noted that some are needed to obtain correct
forms for irrelevant words (so that they can be deemed irrelevant),
and that a given word can be misspelled in a number of ways.
Errors in a corpus cannot be overlooked. Evert and Lüdeling
(2001) point out, for example, that each error in a corpus typically
occurs only once and could greatly distort the number of hapaxes.

The high productivity of -ee is somewhat unexpected, on
its face. Based on the measure P, Baayen and Lieber (1991)
also find -ee (0.0016) to be more productive than -er
(0.0007), and they attribute the high productivity of -ee to
the “vogue” nature of this suffix, as suggested by Marchand
(1969).
In contrast to -ee, the productivity of -er is lower than we
might have expected. Also lower than expected is the PDE
index for -ly. The result for -ly seems unsatisfactory
considering the high regularity in -ly word formation—the
suffix attaches to almost any adjective to form an adverb,
with few restrictions (Aronoff, 1976: 37 fn 4; Baayen &
Renouf, 1996: 82–83). The low PDE indices for -er and -ly
might be thought to arise from large values of V for these
suffixes; however, Spearman’s test shows no significant
correlation between V and PDE, rs = .203, p > .10. We will
return later to the data for -er and -ly.
Overall, we find that the PDE measure yields results that
largely accord with the productivity expected for the
suffixes examined.

Sample Size Dependency
A question that naturally arises in evaluating the PDE
measure is to what extent the measure is dependent on
sample size. Could it be the case, for example, that the
productivity ranking of suffixes would differ markedly if the
two corpus segments were smaller? Table 3 presents PDE as
a function of corpus segment size.7 Again, each PDE value is
a mean over 100 simulation runs.
We find that PDE values are remarkably similar across
three series with different corpus-segment sizes. Friedman’s
test finds no significant difference in PDE among the three,
χ2(2,13) = 2.627, p > .10. Spearman’s test shows that the
PDE indices are highly positively correlated: for 10 vs. 20
million words, rs = .990, p < .01; for 10 vs. 30 million
words, rs = .971, p < .01; and for 20 vs. 30 million words, rs
= .984, p < .01. Thus, the PDE measure offers a consistent
7

As is clear from the formulation of the measure, a change in
corpus segment size applies simultaneously to both corpus
segments.

Token Frequency r

Figure 1: Probability of word w being identified as new.
We compare the outcome of RD and RW as follows. VN
values obtained under RD are listed in Table 2. For each of
the 100 simulation runs generating these values, we sum the
two corpus segments to obtain the whole corpus, and then,
based on token frequencies in this whole, calculate a VN
value expected under RW, E(VN), based on the following
formula:

Token Frequency of New Words
One advantage of the PDE measure is that new words in a
corpus are identified in a way that is not solely dependent on
token frequency. To ensure that advantage, it is crucial to
implement the measure by creating corpus segments via
random sampling at the level of documents (hereafter RD),
rather than random sampling at the level of words (hereafter
RW). The data presented in the preceding sections arise in
implementations using RD.
If we were to follow RW, which words become identified
as new would be dependent on their token frequency in the
whole corpus.8 Under the PDE measure, a word is identified
as new if all its tokens are distributed into only one corpus
segment. If we were to randomly distribute words into two
corpus segments (i.e., RW), the probability P that word w
with token frequency r (in the whole corpus) will be
identified as new is given by: P(w: new) = 2(0.5r). Figure 1
shows how P(w: new) changes as a function of r. We find
that words that occur more than a few times in the whole
corpus are highly unlikely to be identified as new. Hapaxes
are exceptional in that they are guaranteed to be new,
regardless of whether RD or RW is adopted. What is of
interest regarding the difference between RD and RW is
how many non-hapaxes are found to be new.

We find that each value of E(VN) is consistently an
underestimation of the VN. That is, more new words are
captured by RD than by RW.
What kind of words are responsible for the discrepancy
between RD and RW that is exhibited in Table 4? Consider
causee (undoubtedly new to the majority of English
speakers, except perhaps those who are syntacticians),
which occurs 9 times in 1 document of the written
component of the BNC. Under RW, the probability that all 9
tokens of causee will be distributed into only a single corpus
segment is as low as about 0.002—in effect, causee is
virtually guaranteed to be identified as non-new under RW.

1026

Under RD, on the other hand, all 9 tokens of causee
(occurring in just 1 document) will inevitably be distributed
into only one corpus segment, and causee will thus be
identified as new. The advantage of the PDE measure (when
implemented with RD) is that it captures as new words
those words such as causee that are repeatedly used by the
same speaker.

Implications for Linguistic Intuitions
Intuition-Based Interpretation
Although intuitions about productivity may not be reliable,
they play an informal yet important role in evaluating results
for a productivity measure—such results are often said to be
intuitive or counter-intuitive. However, to the extent that
little is known about the nature of such intuitions,
determining the validity of a productivity measure on this
basis may not be viable. Nevertheless, we may still ask what
kind of information could be available to speakers
(linguists) when they offer intuitive judgments about
productivity.
We found in Table 2 that PDE indices for -er and -ly are
unexpectedly low, but one possibility is that the data on
which PDE is built are simply not in the form to be
accessible to intuition. Speakers presumably cannot tell with
any precision, for example, how many -er and -ee word
types exist in the BNC, and thus, exact values of V, VN, and
PDE may have little relevance to speakers’ intuitions. On the
other hand, speakers may be able to predict that “more” -er
words than -ee words will occur.
What will be attempted here is a transformation of the
data underlying the PDE measure into a form that could be
relevant to speakers’ intuitions. There are two points to
consider. The first is the possibility that whatever type
frequency information speakers may have access to may be
better represented on a logarithmic scale. Word frequency
effects have been well studied in psycholinguistics (since
Howes & Solomon, 1951; see Monsell, 1991, for an
overview), where it has been noted that reaction time for a
word in a lexical decision task is inversely proportional to
the log frequency of that word. Although word frequency
effects are normally discussed with respect to token
frequency, the possibility that we entertain is that a similar
logarithmic scaling may be also applicable to type
frequency information.
The second point to consider is Baayen’s (1993: 204)
view that speakers’ intuitive judgments on productivity are
ordinal rather than interval in nature. Speakers presumably
cannot tell to what extent -ness is more productive than -ity,
but they may reject a productivity ranking in which -ness is
ranked lower than -ity. Baayen also suggests that intuitions
about productivity may simply be unavailable for some
affixes.
Transforming V and VN into log10V and log10VN and taking
their ratio (by analogy to VN/V) is too simplistic a solution,
and suffers a problem in that the complementary
relationship between VN and VNN will be broken: the order

of suffixes defined by VN/V should be the reverse of the
order defined by VNN/V, but that relationship will no longer
hold when values are log-transformed values. A solution to
this dilemma is to shift our point of view, and to think of
log10VN as the extent to which words are new and of
log10VNN as the extent to which words are non-new. These
are two conflicting factors that may simultaneously affect
speakers’ “impression” about a given word formation
process. When log10VN (the extent to which words with a
suffix are new) approaches log10VNN (the extent to which
words with that suffix are non-new), the word formation
process for that suffix may be felt to be productive, with a
degree that can be calculated by the ratio of log10VN to
log10VNN.9 Table 5 presents a productivity ranking of
suffixes calculated in just this way.

Following the view that intuitive judgments on
productivity have an ordinal character, we concentrate only
on the ranking of suffixes shown in Table 5. Interestingly,
we seem to have gained many improvements as compared
to Table 2. We particularly note the following: (a) -ness
now counts as the most productive suffix; (b) -er and -ly
move up in the ranking to be close to -ness and -ish; (c) -ee
moves down in the ranking but is still close to -ize; and (d)
-ify is now much lower in the ranking. Perhaps one
unsatisfactory result is that -ly still does not emerge as the
most productive suffix.
Although the exploration offered in this final section is
based on speculation about what information could be
available to speakers, the fact that the productivity ranking
of suffixes in Table 5 is intuitively satisfying, by and large,
suggests that the approach merits further investigation in
future research.

Conclusion
The analysis of the data for the PDE measure demonstrates
that the deleted estimation method offers an effective means
of capturing new words in corpus data and of assessing the

The complementary relationship between VN and VNN is of course
maintained by the ratio of log10VNN to log10VN.

productivity of affixes. An interesting characteristic of the
PDE measure is that its identification of new words is not
dependent on token frequency, and this may be construed as
an advantage, given potential burstiness in the use of new
coinages. The current measure identifies a word as new
regardless of whether it is used repeatedly by the same
speaker. The measure is also shown to be stable over
different sample sizes.
Some findings appeared to deviate slightly from our
intuitive expectations, but we proposed, (appealing to a
psycholinguistic interpretation of the data), that it may be
necessary to draw a distinction between raw corpus statistics
and information that could be accessible to intuitions about
productivity. Corpus statistics, scaled in psychologically
plausible ways, may offer insights into the kind of
information available to speakers when they make intuitive
judgments on productivity.
A description of productivity obtained with a corpusbased productivity measure will be useful in many forms of
linguistic research, not necessarily limited to the study of
word formation. The success of the present study provides
another indication that the corpus-based approach to the
study of productivity advocated by Baayen (1992, 2001) is
worthy of many future extensions.
