Abstract

generalization task, children are shown an exemplar like
those in Figure 1. They are told its name, and then asked
what other things have the same name. When shown an
exemplar like that in Figure 1a, with cues indicating it is a
depiction of an animate thing, children systematically
generalize its name only to new instances that match in both
shape and texture, but not to things that match in shape only
or texture only. When shown an entity without such
features, children systematically generalize the name to new
instances that match in shape, whether they match in other
properties or not, as shown in Figure 1b. Jones & Smith,
(1991) and others have suggested that children learn
correlations between features and category structure -between having eyes and being in a category organized by
shape and texture, and between being angular (and without
animacy features) and being in a category organized by
shape. Consistent with theories and evidence on attentional
learning, they suggest that in the novel noun generalization
task, these features automatically increase attention to
relevant properties, enabling children to attend to the right
similarities according to the kind of the object at hand. This
correlational learning account has been supported by
showing that the requisite correlations between features and
category organization exist across the first 300 nouns that
children learn (Samuelson & Smith, 1999).

There is an ongoing debate on the nature of the processes
and knowledge involved in learning language. On one side of
the debate, people argue that children learn words through
deliberative processes that use propositional conceptual
knowledge; on the opposing side, people argue that children
learn words through automatic processes and knowledge
based on learned associations among perceptual features. In
this paper we concentrate on the Animate/Inanimate
distinction as evidenced in children’s novel noun
generalizations. The results of two experiments with 3-yearolds and adults suggest that 1) automatic processing guides
children’s generalizations of novel nouns and 2) “conceptual”
knowledge may be formed as a web of learned correlations.

Background
The nature of the processes and knowledge involved in
children’s learning of new nouns is a highly contentious
issue. Children generalize names for things in appropriate
ways depending on the kind of thing being named. For
example they generalize names for artifacts by their shape;
names for non-solid substances by their material; and names
for animates by their shape and texture. The debate centers
on the nature of the processes and knowledge involved in
this behavior. On one side of the debate, people argue that
children reason about category membership using slow,
deliberative, conscious processes and propositional beliefs
about categories and category structure (Gelman &
Markman, 1987; Keil, 1994; Kemler-Nelson, Russell, Duke
& Jones, 2000). On the opposite side, people support fast,
unconscious, automatic processes and knowledge in the
form of correlations among perceptual features (Smith,
1995; Smith, 2000; Smith, Colunga & Yoshida, 2003).
Sometimes this debate has been framed in terms of whether
children’s early word learning is “smart” (reflective,
conceptual) or “dumb” (built from more basic general and
automatic processes). In this paper we concentrate on the
Animate/Inanimate distinction as shown in children’s novel
noun generalizations. We show evidence that automatic
processing guides children’s generalizations of novel nouns,
and suggest that the “conceptual” knowledge that enters
word learning, even in adults, may be me made out of
correlations of perceptual features.
One widely used task to study children’s word learning
biases is the novel noun generalization task. In this

Figure 1. Examples of an exemplar with cues indicating it
is a depiction of an animate thing, and an exemplar with
artifact cues.
Recently, Booth and Waxman (2002) provided support
for the alternative “smart” interpretation of children’s
performance in this task. Booth and Waxman presented
exemplars in a context that construed them as animate or
inanimate. The disambiguating context consisted of brief
stories in which the experimenter gave the child information
about the exemplar. For example, in the animate condition,

239

the experimenter introduced an exemplar as a Teema and
explained that the Teema has a mommy and a daddy that
love it very much and gave it hugs and kisses. Similarly, in
the inanimate condition, the experimenters showed the same
exemplar but this time introduced it as a Teema which is
used by astronauts in their trips and will be replaced if it
breaks. Their results showed that 3-year-olds can use the
information in the stories to guide their generalizations of
the novel noun – in the Animate condition, children
generalized the novel name for the exemplar to other objects
matching in shape and texture, but in the Artifact condition
they generalized the novel name to any object that matched
the exemplar on shape. Booth and Waxman take this result
to mean that children word learning is “smart”, a result of
deliberative processes operating on conceptual knowledge
in the form of an unitary concept of animacy. Their account
is illustrated in Figure 2a.

basis of learned correlations among perceptible properties.
Having eyes correlates with having a mouth, correlates with
being called “he” or “she”, correlates with animate-like
motion patterns, correlates with attention to shape and
texture. This web of correlations is the “knowledge” used in
the novel noun generalization task through automatic
processes, rather than through deliberative reasoning.
Importantly, by this account any one cue can activate any
other part of the web, depending on the degree to which they
have been correlated in the learner’s experience. Under
this view, Booth and Waxman’s results can be explained as
a consequence of learned correlations among perceptible
properties, including words. The vignettes shift children’s
attention because they are made out of words – words that
correlate with categories of animates that are organized by
shape and texture (like zebra, or snake) and words that
correlate with categories of artifacts that are organized by
shape (like hammer, or cup).
If the correlational story is correct, these words should
cue attention to shape and texture in the Animate condition
and attention to shape in the Artifact condition
automatically, and without being strung together to form a
coherent story about the exemplar. A strong test of this
prediction would be to prime the children with animatecorrelating or artifact-correlating words presented merely as
a list and measure how this affects their performance in the
novel noun generalization task. Under Booth and Waxman’s
explanation, reading children these words in a list should
not have an effect since they are not put together into a
coherent story that presents conceptual information
regarding ontological status, nor are they presented as
referring in any way to the exemplar. Thus, if children’s
novel noun generalizations are shifted by this priming, this
attentional shift will not be attributable to any kind of
deliberative process that reasons about the ontological status
of the exemplar using the information given by the
experimenter. Experiment 1 tests this prediction.

Experiment 1

Figure 2. In Booth & Waxman’s account, eyes, like
vignettes, serve as a gateways to children’s concept of
animacy. In the correlational learning account, eyes and
words like “she” or “mommy” are part of a web of
correlations that is learned from the regularities that exist in
animate categories in the world.

Methods
Participants. 24 3-year-old children with a mean age of
42.6 months (range: 38.4-45-5 months) participated.
Materials. The stimuli consisted of two sets of eight
abstract objects that could be construed as either animate or
inanimate. Each set consisted of an exemplar object and 7
test objects that matched the exemplar in none, one, or more
features of shape, texture or color. Figure 3 shows the
diagnostic items, the ID test object matched the exemplar in
all shape, color and texture features (but was different in
size), there were also test objects that matched the exemplar
in shape only, color only, texture only, shape + texture,
shape + color, color + texture, and none of these features.
Two lists of words, one of animate-correlating words, the
other of artifact-correlating words, were selected from the
Animate and Artifact vignettes in Booth and Waxman
(2002). Table 1 shows the words used.

According to Booth and Waxman, the stories affect
children’s extension of novel nouns because they provide
conceptual information relevant to the exemplar’s
ontological kind. That is, the Animate story identifies the
exemplar as an animate, and the Artifact story identifies the
exemplar as an artifact. Once children know the ontological
kind of the exemplar, they have access to all the knowledge
regarding that ontological kind, including the fact that shape
and texture are central features for Animates and shape is
the central feature for Artifacts.
The correlational learning account can also explain Booth
and Waxman’s findings. Novel nouns are extended on the

Figure 4. Results for Experiment 1.
Furthermore, post-hoc analysis revealed different patterns
of noun extension in the two conditions. As shown in
Figure 4, children in the Animate condition extend the name
to the ID test object and to the shape+texture match,
whereas children in the Artifact condition extend the name
to the ID test object, the shape-only, the shape+texture and
the shape+color matches. We counted the number of
children who said “yes” more than expected by chance on
each condition. On the critical test item, the shape-only
match, there was a significant difference on the number of
children who said “yes” more than expected by chance in
the Animate versus the Artifact condition (χ 2(1,N=24) =
4.19, P <0.05). That is, children in the Artifact condition
extended the name of the exemplar to all the test objects that
matched it in shape, regardless of their size, color or texture,
but children in the Animate condition extended the name of
the exemplar more conservatively, only to those test objects
that matched it in both shape and texture.

Procedure. Children were randomly assigned to either
the Animate or Artifact condition. During the Priming
Phase, the child and the parent were asked to repeat the
words said by the experimenter. The experimenter then went
through the corresponding list saying each word once and
letting parent and child repeat it. None of the test objects or
exemplars were in view during the Priming phase. The
Priming Phase was followed by the Testing Phase. The list
of words was put away and children were informed that now
they were going to play a different game and they were
introduced to one of the exemplars “This is a Teema.” and
then asked for each of the test objects in that set “Is this a
Teema?”. Each of the test objects were presented twice in
one of two previously generated random orders. Then the
second set was presented, preceded by a second Priming
Phase, for a total of 28 trials. The order of the sets was
counterbalanced across conditions.

Discussion
At the very least, the results of Experiment 1 showed
where the Animacy/Artifact information in Booth and
Waxman’s vignettes comes from. Just hearing these words,
without weaving them into a coherent story, was enough to
shift children’s attention to features typical of animate vs.
artifact categories – shape only for artifacts, shape+texture
for animates. But more importantly, children’s novel noun
generalizations were influenced by these words in a priming
paradigm, without these words being heard at the same time
that the exemplar or test objects were present. Apparently,
these words automatically activate the attentional biases
with which they are associated, a fact consistent with wellsupported ideas about memory processes (). The result thus
supports the idea that children’s novel noun generalizations
depend on automatic processes that operate on learned
correlations.
But is it possible that the concept of animacy is nothing
but learned correlations of perceptible features? At least
intuitively, it would seem that adults have a concept of
animacy that corresponds to the kind of conceptual
knowledge Booth and Waxman are talking about. Certainly,
adults know the word “animate” and understand the words
“living thing”. Do these concepts enter into their
generalizations of novel nouns? Will adults differentially

Results
The number of “yes” responses (the name applies) was
submitted to a 2(Priming List)x7(Test Item) repeated
measures ANOVA. The analysis revealed a main effect of
Priming List (F (1,22) = 5.38, P < .05). That is, children
overall said “yes” more when primed with the Artifact list
of words than when primed with the Animate list. There was
also a main effect of Test Item (F(1,22) = 37.21, P < .001). No
interactions were significant.

generalize names for ambiguous stimuli if told the exemplar
represents an animate entity vs. an artifact? One reason to
believe they may not is that “animate” – the word – as such,
is probably not very correlated with perceptual category
formation, that is, with deciding the range of instances that
go in a category. If the knowledge used in this task comes
from learned correlations, the word “animate” in and of
itself may not be potent enough to activate attention to
shape and texture. A better cue would be one that is strongly
associated with perceptual category decision and category
name extensions.
In contrast, by Booth and Waxman’s account, the word
“animate” should directly activate adults’ concept of
animacy, indeed, and should therefore direct adults to the
relevant knowledge within that concept, enabling them to
reason that the relevant properties for categorization are
shape and texture.
Experiment 2 tests these ideas using two experimental
conditions. In one, adults were told the exemplar is an
animate or an artifact; in the other, they were given
additional perceptual cues (motion) correlated with animates
or artifacts.

ontological kind information consisted solely of words like
“animate” and “artifact”, attention was not shifted

Figure 6 shows adults’ performance in the Word+motion
conditions. Again, the number of “yes” responses was
submitted to a 2(Kind) x 7(TestItem) repeated measures
ANOVA. The analysis revealed a main effect of TestItem
(F(1,18) = 26.543, P < 0.001) and a significant interaction
between Kind and TestItem (F(2,18) = 3.024, P < 0.01). Posthoc analysis confirmed a different pattern of responses in
the Animate and Artifact conditions for the shape match.
There was a significant difference on the number of adults
who said “yes” more than expected by chance on the shapeonly match in the Animate versus the Artifact condition
(χ2(1,N=20) = 5.4945, P <0.025). As predicted, participants
were more likely to accept the shape only match in the
Artifact than in the Animate condition. Thus, adult’s novel
noun generalizations, when given additional perceptual cues
highly correlated with ontological status, did generalize
names according to kind – by shape and texture for
Animates and by shape for Artifacts.

Experiment 2
Methods
Participants. 40 undergraduate students participated in
this experiment.
Stimuli. The two sets of objects used in Experiment 1
were used in this experiment.
Procedure. Participants were randomly assigned to one
of 4 conditions: WordOnly-Animate, WordOnly-Artifact,
Word+motion-Animate, and Word+motion-Artifact.
Participants were introduced to the exemplar of a set and
told “This is a Teema. It is an animate. It is a living thing”
in the WordOnly-Animate condition; “This is a Teema. It is
an artifact. It was made in a factory” in the WordOnlyArtifact condition. In the Word+motion condition, the
exemplar was presented with the corresponding phrases but
they were also moved in a walking or slithering motion in
the Animate condition or in a rolling or hammering motion
in the Artifact condition. Each participant saw both sets and
the order of the sets was counterbalanced across conditions.
As in Experiment 1, each participant was queried on each of
the 7 test-objects twice, for a total of 28 trials.

Conclusion

information they get about the kind of the exemplar is in the
form of phrases like “is an animate” and “is a living thing”.
They do, however, show differing patterns of
generalizations when perceptual correlations, in the form of
motion cues, are added. This result suggests that, although
adults most likely understand what the word “animate” and
what the phrase “living thing” mean, this may not be the
kind of information that enters in generalizing a novel noun.
It also suggests that reasoning about the implication of the
ontological status of the exemplar is not the kind of process
that primarily guides the extension of novel nouns. Instead,
this result suggests that the knowledge that constrains novel
noun generalizations is formed by learned correlations of
perceptual features and category structure.

Extending a novel noun in ways consistent with the
ontological kind of its referent is certainly a “smart” thing to
do – it allows word learning to proceed quickly and carves
the world into useful partitions. However, this “smartness”
may be the product of rather “dumb” processes such as
associative learning and generalization by similarity.
Through the application of these dumb mechanisms in a
world that presents regularities we may create smart
concepts.

General Discussion
Put together, the results of the two experiments support
the idea that automatic processes operating on learned
correlations of perceptual information can guide word
learning. The results of Experiment 1 showed that just
listening to a list of words correlated with animates (or a list
of words correlated with artifacts) is enough to shift
children’s attention to the features that typically organize
categories of animates (or artifacts). The fact that the lists of
words -- without forming complete sentences, without
referring to the exemplar, without even co-occurring with
the exemplar – can shift attention in kind-specific ways
suggests an explanation to Booth and Waxman’s results that
does not need to appeal to any form of deliberative
reasoning on the party of the child. It could be, however,
that when given complete sentences forming coherent
stories, children do take advantage of that information and
more deliberative processes that work on this more
propositional information are invoked, but the results in
Booth and Waxman (2002) and the results in Experiment 1
can be explained as simple priming, operating on previously
learned associations. Further experiments are necessary to
determine when this more “conceptual” knowledge is used
in extending a novel noun.
Furthermore, the results of Experiment 2 suggest that
what we think of as more “conceptual” knowledge may be,
at the end, nothing more than a web of correlations,
including perceptual features, words, category structure,
contexts, and so on. The adults in this experiment failed to
shift their attention when explicitly told that the exemplar
was animate or artifact, but had no problem doing so when
given further correlational support, like watching the to-beconstrued-as-animate exemplar “walk” or used as a
hammer. Clearly, adults do have highly abstract knowledge
about animates and artifacts, and in a different task they
might show this. For example, if the task were to make
inferences about the exemplar, being told that it is to be
construed as an animate might lead to more sound reasoning
than watching it “slither”. However, it seems that when it
comes to extending a novel noun, adults, like children, rely
on automatic processes guided by learned correlations.
