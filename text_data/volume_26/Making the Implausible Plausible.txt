                      Experiment 2
Experiment 2 is identical to Experiment 1, except
participants are asked to rate the plausibility of
scenarios on a scale from 0-10 instead of simply
choosing whether the scenario seems plausible or
implausible. In other words, participants are presented
with implausible scenarios and are asked to judge how
plausible they find each scenario. As with Experiment
1, scenarios in the causal and temporal conditions are
expected to be rated as more plausible than those in the
no-connection control condition because of their greater
concept-coherence.           However, there are two
possibilities for how the causal and temporal conditions
may be distinguished.
   The first possibility is that when people in the causal
condition accept a scenario as plausible, they actually
consider it to be highly plausible. This means that
causal connections between unrelated events would be
considered to have very good concept-coherence;
