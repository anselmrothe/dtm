Results
To avoid considering data that did not accurately reflect the
phenomena under investigation, participants that made four
or more errors (over a total of 20 possible answers) in the
control task were excluded from the sample.3 The data of
19 (out of 111) participants were thus discarded, and the fol-
lowing analyses were carried out on the remaining ones: 28
participants in the Low condition, 30 in the Medium, and 34
in the High condition, respectively.
