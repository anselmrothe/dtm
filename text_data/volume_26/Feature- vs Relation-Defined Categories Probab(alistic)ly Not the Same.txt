(which e1 possesses but e2 does not) and r4 (which e2 pos-
sesses but e1 does not): s1,2 = [r2, r3]. Mapping s1,2 onto,
say, e3, produces a schema containing only r3, and mapping
that schema onto e4 produces a schema containing no rela-
tions. The resulting schema is clearly not a useful basis for
classifying exemplars as members of the category.
      The point is that relational category learning is pre-
dicted to be extremely difficult when the categories have a
strictly probabilistic structure (i.e., with no relation shared
by all exemplars). By contrast, if there is even a single rela-
tion that is shared by all exemplars, then category learning
should improve dramatically relative to the purely probabil-
istic case. Categorization performance should also improve
dramatically, even with purely probabilistic categories, if
the relational structure is replaced with a feature-based
structure. Learning of feature-based categories is well
known to be robust to probabilistic category structures, a
fact that underlies prototype effects (e.g., Posner & Keele,
1968).
      In summary, we predict a sharp dissociation between                               Figure 1: Example stimulus.
