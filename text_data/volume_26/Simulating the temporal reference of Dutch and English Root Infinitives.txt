   Thirdly, MOSAIC uses no built-in linguistic knowledge.
Whatever representations it builds up during learning are a
result of the interaction between its learning mechanism and
the distribution of the input it sees. This last characteristic is
important because Hoekstra & Hyams’ explanation of the
differential reading of RIs is dependent on the assumption
that the child knows that the infinitival morpheme implies a
modal interpretation (rather than learning the association
through exposure to the input). MOSAIC will be described
