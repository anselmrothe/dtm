Subjects were instructed to localize the target as
accurately as possible while pointing this cursor towards
the perceived location of the target, the temporal
constraint being secondary. The picture 4 illustrates the
response distribution of the 10 subjects and 10 repetitions

experiment consisted of 6 experimental sessions with 10
repetitions of each stimulus combination (3 stimulus

azimuth values, 5 elevation values] presented in pseudo-
random order) for a total of 175 trials per session, with a
1.5s inter-trial interval.
Prior to testing, 20 practice trials were performed to make
the participant familiar with the task and the manipulation
of the track-ball. The session lasted about 30 min. and a
                                                                                       Auditory condition

Data analysis
   Localization errors were calculated as the difference, in
degrees, between the localization judgment and the actual
target location. Taking into consideration the azimuth and
elevation components of the response, centering and
precision of the responses were calculated from the raw
data. Centering refers to the mean response, which the
sign denotes a tendency to overshoot (positive values
associated to errors eccentric to the target in reference to
the reference coordinates) or undershoot (negative values
associated to errors central to the target). Precision

the major orientation of the response distribution.
Estimation of the maximum and minimum variance of the
distribution along the slope axis and the perpendicular
one, respectively noted b and a, were used for dispersion
analysis. By extension, in reference with Hofman et Van
Opstal (Hofman et Van Opstal, 1998), a characterization
of the response patterns under a geometrical
approximation, i.e. ellipses, did allow a better comparison
within and between modalities than the traditional
methods using a two-dimensional discontinuous space
analysis (Oldfield et Parker, 1984). In this way, the
analysis of dispersion and orientation of the patterns
would provide complementary data to those obtained with
the use of the horizontal and vertical axis of the 2D
coordinate system. To analyze the data, multiple 2-way
