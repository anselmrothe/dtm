gineers [4, 5, 6] and a daunting enigma for cognitive scien-
tists [7, 8]. Computational models of language acquisition or
“grammar induction” are usually divided into two categories,
depending on whether they subscribe to the classical gener-
ative theory of syntax, or invoke “general-purpose” statisti-
cal learning mechanisms. We believe that polarization be-
tween classical and statistical approaches to syntax hampers
the integration of the stronger aspects of each method into a
common powerful framework. On the one hand, the statisti-
cal approach is geared to take advantage of the considerable
progress made to date in the areas of distributed represen-              Figure 1: the context free grammar used to generate the cor-
