to variation in cultural tools and techniques; for example,
Americans and Europeans chop vegetables by holding
them still and bringing a knife down on them from above,
whereas Punjabi speakers in rural Pakistan and India often

   In studying the categorization of “cutting and breaking”
events, it is not obvious a priori what the domain of
investigation should be taken to encompass. Whereas
speakers of English do not use cut and break for actions
like peeling a banana or pulling paper cups apart, and they
do not use open for events like breaking the stem off an
apple, perhaps such categorizations occur in other
languages. Children learning English in fact make such
overextensions (Bowerman, in press; Schaefer, 1979),
which suggests that the boundaries of the “cutting and
breaking” domain may not be cognitively obvious, and
therefore not universally shared. One important goal for
