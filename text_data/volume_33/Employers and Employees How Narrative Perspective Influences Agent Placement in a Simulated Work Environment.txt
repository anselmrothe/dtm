Abstract: Virtual character agreement has an underlying spatial component, where increased physical distance
is associated with decreased shared attitude (Matthews & Matlock, 2010). This work addresses the relationship
between expected character interaction and agent placement in a simulated work environment.
   After imagining being either an employer or an employee in a meeting about salary adjustments, participants drew
an employee figure in a virtual office environment. When taking the employee’s perspective, participants placed
virtual agents reliably closer to their employer’s agent when expecting to discuss a pay raise, and farther away when
expecting to discuss a pay cut. No inter-agent differences were found when readers took the employer’s perspective.
   These results suggest that agent viewpoint is important in virtual environments. Not only does inter-agent distance
influence employer/employee agreement, as previous work has shown, this relationship seems to be bi-directional,
where narrative content also influences agent placement.
