Co-occurrence probability was calculated using CHILDES,
a corpus of child speech and child-directed speech
(MacWhinney, 2000). Five databases in the corpus were
analyzed: the Bates, Brown, Gleason, HSLLD, and Wells
databases. Raw co-occurrence frequencies were normalized
using the Jaccard index (Van Eck & Waltman, 2009): the
number of raw co-occurrences was divided by the sum of
each word occurring individually minus the number of times
the two words co-occurred (for details see Fisher, 2010).
Based on the analysis of the CHILDES corpus, the mean co-
occurrence probability of labels in the co-occurring
condition was 0.04 and in the non-co-occurring condition
0.00, independent-samples t (6) = 3.16, p = 0.02.
Procedure
All children were tested individually in a quiet room
adjacent to their classroom. All adult participants were
tested in a laboratory on campus. Visual stimuli were
presented on a computer and instructions and labels were
given verbally by hypothesis-blind experimenters.
