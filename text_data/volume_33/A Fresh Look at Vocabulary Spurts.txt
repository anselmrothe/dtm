Quantifying spurts
AMD also provides rigorous quantification of the important
features of significant spurts: (1) when the spurt starts, (2)
the point where it is most intense (maximal velocity), (3) the
spurt amplitude and (4) the spurt duration. An example is
given in Figure 2. A spurt starts when velocity is at an
inflection point, acceleration is at a local maximum, and jerk
crosses 0 at a negative slope. A spurt peaks when velocity is
at a local maximum, acceleration crosses 0 at a negative
slope, and jerk is negative. A spurt ends when velocity is at
                                                                      Figure 2: Example of quantification of spurt features: where

jerk crosses 0 on a positive slope. Spurt amplitude is given
by the vertical distance from acceleration at the start to
acceleration at the end.
   In previous work, AMD successfully detected and
measured three important and well-known phenomena of
physical growth of children: (1) An adolescent growth spurt
in virtually all children; (2) an earlier age of onset for girls’
adolescent growth spurts than for boys’; and (3) a smaller,
pre-adolescent growth spurt in some children. Such spurts
tend to be small and difficult to detect without techniques
like AMD (Dandurand & Shultz, 2010).
Applying AMD to the vocabulary spurt
Our previous work also included some preliminary results
for vocabulary spurts. In simulated data derived from a
computational model of this spurt (McMurray, 2007), AMD
flexibly found one large, global spurt under a low degree of
sampling, and many local, mini-spurts under higher
sampling.
   In real vocabulary data from three English-speaking
children (Corrigan, 1978), AMD found an average of 2.0                    Figure 3: Example of an AMD analysis of vocabulary

vocabulary growth had been recorded daily over the second
year of life (Ganger & Brent, 2004). These are the same 20

enable large sample sizes, enhanced validity, and good
reliability. We converted new words per day to cumulative
vocabulary, and assumed a variation of zero when an
observation value was not available (i.e., for missing data).
   The main unspecified parameter in AMD, as in most FDA
techniques, is lambda, which controls the amount of
smoothing that is applied to the raw data. We tried several
lambda values (1, 100, 1 × 105, and 1 × 1010) and noticed the
usual decrease in detected spurts with increases in lambda.
For this paper, we concentrate on the results with a lambda          Figure 4: Spurts in vocabulary growth for 20 children

A plot of spurt locations and amplitudes for all 20 children
at a lambda value of 1 × 1010 is presented in Figure 4. The
number of spurts in this smoothing condition ranged from 1
to 6, with a mean of 3.0 and SD of 1.5. Three children
showed only 1 spurt. Examples of representative individual
cases are shown in Figures 5 and 6. Child 10 had 2 spurts,
with the largest one being last at 554 days. Child 22 showed
4 spurts, the largest one being first, at 269 days. The
variability in number, location, and amplitude of spurts is
notable, all of which is obscured in a group plot of
vocabulary spurts averaged across all 20 children (see
Figure 7). Only 2 spurts appear in the averaged plot and
they bear very little relation to results for any of the 20
individual children. The dynamics and variability of
vocabulary growth are nearly completely obscured by group
plots because spurts in individuals vary greatly in location,
number, and intensity.
