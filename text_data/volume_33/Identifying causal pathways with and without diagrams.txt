Study 2 was an attempt to replicate the main findings of
Study 1 and assess the generalizability of the diagram
advantage by using a new set of causal assumptions
corresponding to a new diagram structure. Also, the effect
of manipulating one superficial aspect of the diagram was
investigated, in this case whether the causal flow in the
diagram was generally from left to right (the conventional
orientation observed in many English texts and journal
articles on causal modeling), or from right to left. Our
previous work (Corter et al., 2008; Nickerson et al., 2008)
has shown cognitive effects of supposedly superficial
aspects of how network diagrams are embedded on the
page, including preferences for top-down and left-right
processing of diagrams (see also Taylor & Tversky, 1992;
Tversky et al., 1991).
Method
The methods of Study 2 were essentially the same as for
Study 1, except for use of a new causal structure, and the
addition of a variant diagram with right-to-left causal flow.
Participants. Participants were recruited from a crowd-
sourcing website. After eliminating participants who had
participated in Study 1, and those who failed to follow               Figure 2: Presentation of a set of causal assumptions (Study
