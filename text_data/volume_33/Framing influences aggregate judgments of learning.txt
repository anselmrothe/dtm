positive JOLs, survey C negative JOLs, and survey D
negative JOIs. Survey A asked participants to estimate for
each of six study trials, of the words that are not learned,
how many words students would learn during each study
trial (a negative JOI), and how many words total they would
know after each study trial (positive JOL). Survey B simply
instructed participants to estimate how many words total
would be known after each study trial (+JOL). Survey C
solicited negative JOLs, in other words, how many words
students would not know (get incorrect) after each trial
(negative JOL). Survey D asked for negative JOIs only, of
the words that are not known, how many words would be
learned during each study trial. Students were also asked to
indicate if they had participated in a Swahili memory
experiment in the past, as this would be likely to influence
their judgments of the task.
Design and Procedure. Each participant completed only
one survey type. Surveys were included as part of a larger        Figure 3. Mean Judgments of Learning, no Swahili

were instructed to complete the surveys alone, and in a quiet
place. Surveys were returned and entered a week later.
Scoring. As in Experiment 1, the negative frame JOLs were
converted to positive values by subtracting the values
reported from 50.
Results
22 participants were removed from analysis due to not
entering judgments, misunderstanding instructions, or
having far outlying judgments. Final numbers of
participants for each survey was as follows: 74 for survey
A, 44 for survey B, 81 for survey C, and 54 for survey D.
Unequal samples were a result of many surveys not being
returned.
Judgments of Learning. JOLs were significantly different
