   In all Experiments, subjects’ task was to decide which          Figure 2
stimulus represented the greater quantity (Figure 1 depicts
sample trials). In Experiments 1-2, there were three format
conditions: numeral/numeral (NN), dot/dot (DD), mixed-
format (MX) numeral/dot (or dot/numeral). In Experiment
3, there were three format conditions: numeral/numeral
(NN), number-word/number-word (WW), mixed-format
(MX) numeral/number-word (or number-word/numeral.
Trials were always blocked by condition (with rest and
instructions between blocks), so participants always knew
which presentation-order to expect. The order of condition-
blocks was randomized across participants. For MX trials in
Experiment 1, which side (left or right) contained the dot-
array was randomized across trials. For MX trials in
Experiments 2 and 3, which stimulus-type was presented
first in was also balanced across trials. Subjects were to
press a key with their left middle finger if they thought the
left (Experiment 1) or first (Experiments 2-3) stimulus was
greater, press a key with their right middle finger if they
thought the right (Experiment 1) or second (Experiments 2-
3) stimulus was greater, or press a third key (space bar) with
both index fingers if they thought the two stimuli were
numerically equal (catch trials).
   In all experiments, there were 48 critical trials and 16
catch trials in each condition. In all conditions, half of
critical trials were numerically small (1,2,3,4), and half were
large (10,20,30,40); orthogonally, half of critical trials were
numerically close (|n1–n2| = 1 or 10) and half were far (|n1–
n2| = 2,3,20 or 30). In this way, for each format condition,
stimuli were subdivided into four categories: small-far,
small-close, large-far, large-close. Performance differences
were tested within each of these categories separately: all
contrasts were two-tailed, within-subjects contrasts with 20
degrees of freedom.
                           Results
   In all experiments, two behavioral measures were
collected: response-times (RTs) and error-rates (ERs). RT
and ER condition means are summarized in Table 1.
Contrast results for RTs are shown in Figure 2. In all
experiments, our hypotheses concerned the difference
between the MX and the single-format condition (NN, DD
or WW) that yielded the worst performance in that
experiment.
   In Experiment 1, RTs tended to be longer on DD than NN
trials (large-close: p=.056; large-far: p=.245; small-close:        Figure 2 shows the cost – in milliseconds – of mixing
