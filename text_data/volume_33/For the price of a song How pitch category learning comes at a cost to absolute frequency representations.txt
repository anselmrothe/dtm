Figure 1: Labels are perceptually discrete relative to the sets of frequencies that make up complex tones (a & b, top panels).
When tones and labels are temporally distinct (i.e., learned in sequence), two situations are possible: either the Features of a tone
can predict a Label (FL) or a Label can predict the Features of a tone (LF). When a tone predicts a label (FL), the tone’s various
frequencies compete as predictive cues to that label, leading to competitive discrimination learning (d). However, when a label
predicts a tone (LF), no competition can occur, since labels are discrete cues and cannot compete with themselves (c). In LF-
learning, the absence of competition produces a simple probabilistic representation of the signal being learned about (e). In FL-
learning, by contrast, less reliable features in the signal lose value to those that are more reliable, resulting in representations in
which some features are “overvalued” relative to their rate of occurrence, while others may be ignored (f). FL-learning highlights
predictive features in the signal, improving pitch category discrimination while distorting absolute frequency information.

Figure 4: The cause and consequence of a trade off: LF and FL-trained participants on the two perceptual discrimination tasks
(left panel), and the conceptual tasks (right panel). In the perceptual test, LF-trained participants better distinguished concert pitch
notes from sharp lures, whereas FL-trained participants better discriminated correct notes—and octave transpositions of correct
notes—from lures. The change to the underlying representations that underlie this trade off can be seen in the results of the
conceptual test, where the improvement in between-category discrimination performance brought about by FL-training came at a
cost to within-category discrimination (error bars are SEM).
