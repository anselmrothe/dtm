However, the contextual cuing effect (Non-Repeated RT –

numerically (though not statistically) larger in the Evening

group (M = 31 ms, SD = 104), t(36) = 1.00, p > .30, which
gives some indication that performance may have been
confounded by time of day effects. Perhaps the design of
this study was not powerful enough (0.25) to detect this
difference in performance during the training phase (d = .

   These results are an illustration of the inconsistency of the
learning that takes place in a contextual cuing task (Smyth
& Shanks, 2008), and cause us to conclude that some signs
of contextual cuing, though neither substantial nor reliable,
were present in both the Evening and Morning participant                Figure 1: Mean contextual cuing scores (ms) in the final
