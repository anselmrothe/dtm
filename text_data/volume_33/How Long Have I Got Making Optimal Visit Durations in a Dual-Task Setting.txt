   The current study was designed in such a way to give
participants considerable flexibility in deciding how to
allocate their time across the two tasks over an extended
period of time. In contrast, participants in Janssen et al.’s
(2011) study were required to enter 20 digits in the typing
task. Participants could do this fairly quickly, and the fixed
number of digits meant that that there was a limited space of
plausible ways to interleave the two tasks. The current study
had participants enter a continuous stream of digits while
monitoring the tracking task over a period of 120 seconds.
This meant that participants had considerably greater
freedom in deciding how long they should leave the
tracking task unattended for while entering digits.                Figure 1: Position of the two task windows in the interface.
