Global development of co-ordination
To verify that participants become more co-ordinated at the
task, the chat logs were used to determine the proportion of
correct/incorrect solutions for each participant. Participants’
performance in the first half of the convergence phase (trial
1, 2, 3) was compared with their performance in the second
half (trial 4, 5, 6). Logistic regression showed a significant
increase (χ² (1) = 11.1, p=0.01) from 58% correct to 75%
correct. (see Figure 4, right).
Within vs. Cross-Group
Focusing on trial 7 (Test phase), to test for the effect of
group-specific conventions on task performance, the
proportion of correct/incorrect answers in Within-group
dialogue was compared with Cross-group dialogue. Logistic
regression showed Within-group participants generating
significantly more correct answers (88%) than Cross-group
participants (51%) (χ² (1) = 8.03, p<0.005).                          Figure 4: Proportion of correct solutions (White = Cross-
