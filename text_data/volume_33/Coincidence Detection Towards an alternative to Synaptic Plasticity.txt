Abstract: Memory and learning are believed to be neurally based on a general class of processes known as synaptic
plasticity (Kandel et al., 2000). Working memory, however, is arguably too fast to rely solely on synaptic weighting
and must instead take place as an active neural process (O’Reilly & Manukata, 2000). I propose that active processes,
which can account for both simple stimulus based memories as well as simple associations, can be instantiated within
populations of highly interconnected neurones that exploit the precise timing of spikes; I call these ”firing-chains”.
In a population of N neurones a maximum of T*2N̂ firing-chains exist over time period T, suggesting that many
more firing-chains than neurones or connections exist. I aim to show how self-sustaining firing-chains can implement
simple memories, but also that simple associations between two or more firing-chains can be made if their joint
simultaneous activity triggers a new firing-chain.
