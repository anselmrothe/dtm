Abstract
This study demonstrated that implicit preferences for
Whites compared to Blacks can be temporarily (i.e., less
than a week) reduced or reversed by reading a counterstereotypical scenario about an assault. Explicit racial
associations (i.e., White = Bad, Black = Good) appear to
be not a crucial component of the scenario for shifting the
bias but seem to play a role in increasing the malleability
effect of implicit racial attitudes. When they were not
included in the scenario, a reduction of the implicit
preferences for Whites compared to Blacks (Experiment 2)
was observed, whereas when they were included we found
a reverse of the implicit racial bias indicating a preference
for Blacks than to Whites (Experiment 1).
Keywords: Implicit Association Test; racial bias;
malleability; explicit racial associations; persistence over
time.

Introduction
One of the most used implicit measure of social cognition
is the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald,
McGhee & Schwartz, 1998; Nosek, Greenwald & Banaji,
2007; Nosek, Smyth, Hansen et al., 2007). In a classic
IAT paradigm (Greenwald et al., 1998), participants are
asked to classify four types of stimuli by pressing one of
two keys. In particular, they are asked to discriminate
stimuli belonging to two target categories and stimuli
belonging to two evaluative dimensions. Faster responses
are made when the interest category shares the same
motor response with the stereotypic evaluative dimension
(congruent condition) than when it shares the same motor
response with the non-stereotypic evaluative dimension
(incongruent condition).
Originally, implicit measures were assumed to be
inflexible and resistant to change and insensitive to
external pressures and strategic processes (Bargh, 1999;
Dovidio & Fazio, 1992; Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, &
William, 1995). In contrast to this assumption, recent
research has shown that the implicit measures are highly
sensitive to contextual influences (for a review, see Blair,
2002; Dasgupta & Asgari, 2004; Mitchell, Nosek &
Banaji, 2003).
Multiple interventions were found to elicit shifts of
implicit biases as measured by IAT (e.g., Dasgupta &
Greenwald, 2001; Blair, Ma, & Lenton, 2001; Foroni &
Mayr, 2005). Foroni and Mayr (2005), for example, have
demonstrated that reading a counter-stereotypical

scenario produces a reduction in implicit preferences for
flowers compared to insects. In their scenario,
participants were asked to imagine a fictional postapocalyptic world in which, due to radiation effects,
flowers have become highly noxious, whereas insects
serve as a crucial, indirect food resource for humans.
Moreover, explicit counter-stereotypical associations
between the two categories of interest were included.
Insects were positive and flowers were negative, contrary
to the normal established association flowers are good
and insects are bad (Greenwald et al., 1998).
Even though it has been demonstrated that reading a
scenario influences evaluations in the IAT, the
underlying mechanisms of this malleability effect are not
sufficiently well understood. Foroni and Mayr (2005)
suggested that shift of the implicit preferences can be
attributed by embedding the relevant categories (e.g., in
their case flowers and insects) within a novel and
coherent conceptual network that entails a newly
knowledge structure and a revaluation of the categories.
We conducted the present research to investigate the
underling mechanisms and the persistence over time of
the malleability of implicit attitudes as measured by the
IAT, focusing on the Foroni and Mayr’s scenario
paradigm (2005). Specifically, we investigated whether
implicit racial stereotypes could be shifted after reading a
counter-stereotypical scenario and whether this change
could be detected after one week.

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, according to Foroni and Mayr (2005),
we used a counter-stereotypical scenario in which the tobe-evaluated categories (i.e., in our case White and
Black) were embedded within a meaningful conceptual
network that entails a revaluation of the categories. In
addition,
explicit
associations
were
included.
Specifically, we used a pro-black scenario describing an
assault, in which a positive action was assigned to a
Black individual (i.e., rescuer role) and a negative action
to a White individual (i.e., aggressor role).

Participants Twenty undergraduate students (age 20-29;
mean=21.25; 12 women and 8 men) participated in the
experiment. They were all white participants enrolled at
the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. They were
divided into two groups. Ten participants read a problack scenario, while the other ten read a pro-white
1
scenario.
Procedure and stimuli Participants took part in three
2
sessions. The first and the second sessions were carried
out the same day, while the third session was carried out
one week later. In all sessions, participants performed the
five blocks of the standard race IAT (Greenwald et al.,
1998). They were asked to respond as quickly and
accurately as possible to the stimuli, by pressing one of
two labelled keys. The stimuli consisted of 16 words (8
good words and 8 bad words) and 12 pictures (6 White
individuals and 6 Black individuals). The good
evaluative dimension included words like peace and love,
while the bad evaluative dimension included words like
evil and hurt. The White category included pictures of
White European individuals while the Black category
included pictures of Black African individuals. The
stimuli were the same as in the race IAT on the website
(https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/italy/).
In the second session participants were asked to read a
scenario describing an assault prior to the race IAT. Two
different versions of the same scenario were used. In the
pro-black scenario, the aggressor was a white man and
the rescuer was a black man; in the pro-white scenario,
the aggressor was a black man and the rescuer was a
white man. In the pro-black condition participants were
instructed to imagine that the following task (i.e., the race
IAT) was a tutoring program that was supposed to
establish these associations firmly in people’s minds:
“White = Bad, Black = Good”; the reverse association
was presented in the pro-white condition.
Results and Discussion Analyses were conducted on the
average reaction times (RTs) in blocks 3 and 5. Incorrect
responses were excluded from RT analysis as were
responses faster than 300 ms and slower than 3000 msec.
Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
conducted with scenario group (pro-black vs. pro-white)
as a between-subjects factor and congruency (congruent
vs. incongruent) and session (first, second, third) as
within-subjects factors. A main effect of congruency was
detected, F(1, 17)= 26.979, p<.0001, η²=.613, with RTs
faster in the congruent than in the incongruent block (677
ms vs. 892 ms). The main effect of session, F(2, 34)=
14.446, p<.0001, η²=.459, and the interaction between
congruency and session were significant, F(2, 34)=
13.550, p<.0001, η²= .444. RTs decreased from the first
to the third session (first session = 839 ms, second
session = 798 ms, third session = 716 ms) and although
the IAT effect for RTs (i.e., the RT difference between
congruent and incongruent blocks) was significant for all

three sessions [first session: F(1, 19)= 39.864, p<.0001,
η²=.677; second session: F(1, 19)= 4.412, p<.05,
η²=.188; third session: F(1, 18)= 31.058, p<.0001,
η²=.633], it was smaller in the second than the first
session and the third session (126 vs. 332 vs. 193 ms).
Also, a significant three-way interaction was found
between congruency, scenario group and session, F(2,
34)= 9.809, p<.0001, η²=.366. Separate ANOVAs for
scenario group showed a significant interaction between
congruency and session for the black scenario group, F(2,
16)= 25.845, p<.0001, η²=.764, but not for the pro-white
scenario group, F(2, 18)= 1.764, p= .200, η²=.164. The
IAT effect for RTs was significant in all three sessions
for the pro-white scenario group [first session: F(1, 9)=
15.028, p<.01, η²=.625, second session: F(1, 9)= 19.737,
p<.01, η²=.687; third session: F(1, 9)= 17.436, p<.01,
η²=.660]; while for the pro-black scenario group a
significant difference was evident in the first, F(1, 9)=
25.524, p<.001, η²=.739, and the third sessions, F(1, 8)=
12.697, p<.01, η²=.613.

In addition, we computed the D index (Greenwald,
Nosek, & Banaji, 2003) for each subject and submitted it
to an ANOVA with scenario group (pro-black, pro-white)
as a between-subjects factor and session (first, second,
third) as a within-subjects factor. Overall, a significant
effect of session was detected, F(2, 34)= 15,930,
p<.0001, η²=.484. The D index showed a significant
difference between the first and the second sessions (1.00
vs. .42; p<.0001) and between the second and the third
sessions (.42 vs. .83; p<.01), while no significant
difference was found between the first and the third
sessions (1.00 vs. .83; p=.203). The interaction between
session and scenario group was significant, F(2, 34)=
21.029, p<.0001, η²=.553. The average D index did not
differ across the three sessions for the pro-white scenario
group (F(2, 18)= .472, p=.631, η²=.050). By contrast, a
significant difference between sessions was obtained for
the pro-black scenario group, F(2, 16)= 23.217, p<.0001,
η²=.744. In particular, pairwise comparisons showed that
D values did not differ between the first and third
sessions (p=.189) but significant differences were found
both between the first and second sessions (p<.01) and
between the second and third sessions (p<.01).
In sum, we found that all participants showed a prowhite bias both in the first (pro-black: IAT effect = 331
ms, D=1.09; pro-white: IAT effect = 334 ms, D=.91) and
in third session (pro-black: IAT effect = 169 ms, D=.77;
pro-white: IAT effect = 215 ms, D=.88). An interesting
result emerged in the second session after participants
read a pro-black scenario. Here, they showed a -39 ms
reversal IAT effect and a negative D index (D = -.14),
indicating a pro-black bias. No change was detected in
the group who read the pro-white scenario, which
continued to show a pro-white bias (IAT effect = 291 ms,
D=.98; see Figure 1). The malleability of the pro-white
bias emerged only immediately after the reading of the
pro-black scenario but was not further present at retest
after one week.

IAT Effect

These results demonstrate that implicit racial biases can
be reversed by a counter-stereotypical scenario with
explicit racial associations and that such effect lasts for
less than a week. It is important to consider that the
malleability effect found in the present experiment cannot
be attributed to tendency to respond in a socially
desirable manner. To note, the IAT is an implicit
(automatic) measure of attitudes (for a review, see
Greenwald, Banaji, Rudman, Farnham, Nosek, & Mellot,
2002) developed in order to overcome the problem of
social desirability in the explicit (self-reported) measures
(Levy, 1981; Peltier & Walsh, 1990; Simon & Simon,
1975; Zerbe & Paulhus, 1987). Whereas attitudes
measured by explicit measures are conscious and
controllable, implicit measures allow us to detect
unintentional and automatic attitudes (Wegner & Bargh,
1998), and therefore are less influenced by the tendency
of people to deceive their views in order to present
themselves in a socially acceptable manner. Accordingly,
several studies has revealed that participants cannot to
control voluntarily IAT performances (Asendorpf, Banse,
& Mücke, 2002; Banse, Seise, & Zerbes, 2001; Egloff, &
Schmukle, 2002; Kim, 2003; Fiedler, & Bluemke, 2005;
Steffens, 2004). For example, Kim (2003) showed that
participants could not fake the IAT effectively when
merely instructed to respond with a pro-black attitude.

Experiment 2
One possible explanation for the shift of the implicit
racial bias observed in the Experiment 1 is that the
scenario explicitly associated the Whites and Blacks
categories with a positive or a negative evaluative
dimension. In fact, participants were asked to imagine
that the goal IAT was to establish in people’s minds the

associations “White = Bad, Black = Good”. Therefore the
present experiment tested whether excluding the explicit
racial associations the scenario shifted still the implicit
preferences for Whites over Blacks as in Experiment 1
and whether this change persisted for more than a week.
For this reason, we modified the scenario used in
Experiment 1 eliminating the explicit racial associations.

Method

Participants Twenty-four undergraduate students (age
18-25; mean=22.5; 20 women and 4 men) participated in
the experiment. They were all white participants enrolled
at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Twelve
read the pro-black scenario, while the other twelve read
the pro-white scenario. None of them participated in the
previous experiment.
Procedure and stimuli They were the same as in
Experiment 1 with the only difference that the explicit
racial associations (e.g., that “White = Bad, Black =
Good”) were removed.
Results and Discussion The same analyses as in
Experiment 1 were conducted on RTs and the D index.
For RTs, a main effect of congruency was found, F(1,
22)= 58.721, p<.0001, η²=.727, with RTs faster in the
congruent than in the incongruent block (690 ms vs. 893
ms). Also the main effect of session, F(2, 44)= 27.372,
p<.0001, η²=.554, and the interaction between
congruency and session were significant, F(2, 44)=
17.520, p<.0001, η²= .443. RTs decreased from the first
to the third session (first session = 856 ms, second
session = 801 ms, third session = 718 ms) and although
the IAT effect for RTs was significant for all the three
sessions [first session: F(1, 23)= 76.198, p<.0001,
η²=.768; second session: F(1, 23)= 14.212, p<.001,
η²=.382; third session: F(1, 23)= 33.463, p<.0001,
η²=.593], it was smaller in the second (140 ms) than the
first (303 ms) and the third sessions (165 ms). Also, a
significant three-way interaction between congruency,
scenario group and session, F(2, 44)= 6.951, p<.01,
η²=.240, was found. Separate ANOVAs for scenario
group showed a significant interaction between
congruency and session for the black scenario group, F(2,
22)= 30.605, p<.0001, η²=.736. There was a tendency to
significance for the pro-white scenario group, F(2, 22)=
3.060, p= .067, η²=.218. The IAT effect was significant
in all three sessions only for the pro-white condition [first
session: F(1, 11)= 33.115, p<.0001, η²=.751, second
session: F(1, 11)= 29.059, p<.0001, η²=.725; third
session: F(1, 11)= 13.871, p<.01, η²=.558]; while for the
pro-black condition a significant difference was evident
only in the first, F(1, 11)= 40.962, p<.0001, η²=.788, and
in the third sessions, F(1, 11)= 27.328, p<.0001, η²=.713.
For the D index, a significant effect of session, F(2,
44)= 12.86, p<.0001, η²=.368 (first session =.85, second
session =.47, third session =.73), and of scenario group
were found, F(1, 22)= 5.044, p<.05, η²=.187 (pro-black
scenario group = .56, pro-white scenario group = .81).

1226

IAT Effect

Moreover, a significant interaction between session and
condition was found, F(2, 44)= 10,764, p<.0001,
η²=.329. The average D index did not differ across the
three sessions for the pro-white scenario group. By
contrast, a significant difference between sessions was
obtained for the pro-black condition, F(2, 22)= 18.210,
p<.0001, η²=.623.
In particular, D values did not differ between the first
and third sessions but a significant difference was found
between the first and second sessions (p< .001; .82 vs.
.73) and between the second and third sessions (p< .001;
.13 vs. .73).
In sum, we found a significant pro-white bias for either
of two scenario groups both in the first (pro-black: IAT
effect = 298 ms, D=.82; pro-white: IAT effect = 308 ms;
D=.89) and in the third sessions (pro-black: IAT effect =
141 ms, D=.73; pro-white: IAT effect = 189 ms, D=.74).
In the second session a reduction of the pro-white bias
after reading a pro-black scenario was found (IAT effect
= 31, D = .13). No change in attitude scenario were
observed in the group who read the pro-white scenario
(IAT effect = 249 ms, D=.80; see Figure 2).
These results indicate that implicit racial biases can be
reduced by a counter-stereotypical scenario without
explicit racial associations and confirm the temporariness
of the malleability effect. Thus, the shift of the implicit
bias cannot be attribute to the component of the scenario
that contains the explicit associations per se. Rather, the
effect seems depend on the new evaluative network
within the relevant categories (i.e., in our case White and
Black categories) were embedded, as suggested by
Foroni and Mayer (2005).

General Discussion
We investigated the role and persistence over time of the
effect of a counter-stereotypical scenario on the
malleability of implicit racial attitudes in groups of white
students. We used different counter-stereotypical
scenarios about an assault, in which a positive action was
assigned to a black person (i.e., rescuer role) and a
negative action to a white person (i.e., aggressor role). In
Experiment 1, explicit racial associations (e.g., “White =
Bad, Black = Good”) were included in the scenario.
Conversely, in Experiment 2, no explicit racial
associations were given.
We demonstrated that implicit racial biases may be
shifted (i.e., reduced or reversed) by reading a counterstereotypical scenario. Moreover, we showed that the
presence of explicit racial associations (e.g., “White =
Bad, Black = Good”) in the scenario is not critical to shift
the implicit bias. In fact, a reduction of implicit racial
bias was observed even when the explicit racial
associations were removed from the scenario. However,
it is important to note that when the explicit racial
associations were included in our scenario a greater
malleability effect was observed. In particular we
obtained a reverse of the implicit racial bias, indicating a
counter-stereotypical racial attitude (i.e., pro-black).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that reading a
counter-stereotypical scenario can shift the implicit racial
attitudes and seem to confirm that this change may be
attributed to new evaluation of the relevant categories, as
suggested by Foroni and Mayr (2005). One alternative
explanation to shift of bias could be that in the scenarios
participants were asked to perform a mental imagery
task; in particular, they were asked to imagine themselves
as victims of an assault. According to this view, research
within the social psychology has demonstrated that
mental imagery has relevant benefits on the malleability
of attitudes. For instance, it has been shown that when
participants are asked to imagine encountering an outgroup member (e.g., young participants imagined talking
to an elderly person), before reporting their attitude
towards the out-group, reductions of the explicit
intergroup bias (Turner, Crisp, & Lambert, 2007; see also
Stathi & Crisp, 2008) and implicit prejudice as measured
by the IAT were observed (Turner & Crisp, 2010).
Similarly, reductions of implicit attitudes are also found
when participants are asked to imagine a counterstereotypic mental image before going through an IAT
(Blair, et al., 2001). More specifically, when participants
are asked to create a counter-stereotypic mental image of
strong woman before to perform a gender IAT a
reduction in the automatic association between females
and weakness are obtained. To note, also in the scenario
used by Foroni and Mayr (2005) participants were asked
to imagine themselves as protagonists of the counterstereotypical story. However, it is necessary to consider
also that in our scenario participants were asked to
imagine themselves as victims of assault. We suggest that
the imagined self-involvement task evoked emotions
toward social groups that can shifted the implicit bias. In
particular, a negative emotion toward in-group members
(i.e., Whites) and a positive emotion toward out-group
members (i.e., Blacks). Mental imagery has been found

1227

to elicit similar emotional and motivational responses as
the real experience (Dadds, Bovbjerg, Redd, & Curtmore,
1997) and neuropsychological studies have shown that
mental imagery shares the same neurological bases as
perception and employ similar neurological mechanisms
as memory, emotion, and motor control (Kosslyn, Ganis,
& Thompson, 2001). In addition, research on emotions
and intergroup bias has provided initial evidence that
specific negative emotional states are capable of creating
an implicit prejudice toward out-group from thin air
(DeSteno, Dasgupta, Barlett, & Cajdric, 2004). It is
important to note that in this study participants were not
induced to experience negative emotions toward outgroup but simply to experience a negative emotional state
by writing an autobiographical event from the past that
had made them very angry. We extend this finding
suggesting that evoking negative emotions towards ingroup members and positive emotions towards out-group
members can elicit a shift of implicit bias, that is, a
decreasing of the implicit negative evaluation of the outgroup. Finally, our results demonstrate that the
malleability of implicit bias is only a temporary effect:
shifts in racial attitudes produced by reading a counterstereotypical scenario were not observed after one week.
To our knowledge this is the only study that investigated
the persistence over time of the malleability effect on
implicit bias over such an extended period. For example,
Dasgupta and Greenwald (2001) showed that the
malleability effect obtained by exposing White
participants to admired Black and disliked White
individuals may persist in a follow-up test session 24
hours later. Our results extend this finding by providing
evidence that the malleability effect was no longer
present after one week.
Future works may help to investigate and disentangle
the role of imagined self-involvement and of emotions on
the shift of implicit bias and to clarify exactly how the
malleability effect lasts over time. At present, however,
the current findings extend previous research on the
malleability of implicit prejudices by suggesting that
emotions evoked by imagined self-involvement scenario
may be capable to reduce temporally implicit negative
attitudes.
