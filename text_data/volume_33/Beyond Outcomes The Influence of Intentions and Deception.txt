                          Experiment 1
The central building block of our experiments is a
sequential, probabilistic allocator-responder game with three
choice alternatives and three outcomes (cf. Figure 1, left
panel). First, the “selector” chooses one of three random
devices dubbed “wheels of fortune”. Then nature (alias the
computer) determines the outcome of the wheel of fortune.
Outcomes refer to divisions of 30 tokens (≈£1) between the
selector and the responder. The responder is informed about
the selector's choice and the wheel's outcome. Finally, the
responder can subtract or add between -15 and +15 from the
selector's payoff, whereby for 3 tokens added or subtracted
she has to give up one of her own tokens.1 The core idea of
this design is that the selector’s wheel choices signal her
intention towards the responder, who can reciprocate
intentions and/or adjust outcomes by adding or subtracting
tokens. The probabilities of the wheels and the monetary
divisions associated with the outcomes are summarized in
Table 1.
