   The study was presented in three separate sections. In the
first section, the vignettes were presented sequentially. Half
of the participants made the diagnosis judgment first below
each vignette; the rest made the abnormality judgment first.
In the second section, the vignettes were re-presented with
the other question (abnormality or diagnosis) not presented
in the first section for that participant. In the third section,
the vignettes were re-presented and participants were asked
to make both the cultural acceptability judgment and
statistical commonality judgment below each vignette (order
counterbalanced between participants). People could edit
their responses, but once they advanced to the next vignette,
they could not go back; this was clearly stated up front in
the instructions. Finally, each clinician was asked about his
or her clinical background and experience (see above).
