Abstract: Intuitive theories of physics govern the everyday action of humans. Studies with children and the ability
of adults to adapt to novel physical situations suggest this knowledge might be learned, but how can physics be
learned? We consider different physical models of dynamic situations as generated from an underlying physical
theory defined over Spelke-like objects. This allows us to go from the observed dynamics of objects (e.g. particles
and positions) to the underlying physical model governing the interaction between the objects (e.g. a spring in a
gravity well). The underlying theory is then used to predict and generalize object properties and interactions in
new scenarios. We compare these predictions and generalizations to those of humans faced with the same unfolding
dynamics. We argue that this generative model of physics can explain the ability of humans to learn and generalize
novel dynamics.
