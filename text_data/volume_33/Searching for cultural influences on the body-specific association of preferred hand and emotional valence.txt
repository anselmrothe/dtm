Method
Participants. There were a total of 53 participants, mean
age 25.6 years, age range: 20-53 years. The Spanish group
consisted of 29 students of the University of Granada: 9
left-handers (7 female) and 20 right-handers (6 female).
All of them were native Spaniards, had never lived in an
Arabic country for longer than an occasional stay and did
not know any Arabic language. The Arabic group
consisted of 1 left-hander (female) and 23 right-handers
(10 female). They were recruited by means of
advertisements placed both within and outside the
university. Linguistic and family information of three
participants was lost due to a computer problem. For the
remaining participants, their average number of years in                Figure 1: The diagram sheet presented to participants.

conclusion, however, will need to wait for data being
collected from Arab left-handers. The difficulty of finding
this kind of participant provides another hint to the
strength of the taboos against the left hand in Arab culture.
An alternative strategy will be to temporarily change
perceptuo-motor fluency in Arab righties by means like
those used by Casasanto & Chrisykou (2011), who showed
that a few minutes of acting less fluently with the right
hand in the lab is enough to reverse right-handed Dutch
participants’ implicit associations of good with right and
bad with left. If culture does have an influence, Arab
righties may be more resistant than Spanish righties to the
effects of motor training.
