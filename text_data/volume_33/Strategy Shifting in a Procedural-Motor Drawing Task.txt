Abstract
This study investigated the extent to which cognitive
measures of individual differences predict strategy shifts in a
series of procedural-motor curve-drawing tasks. College
students participated in a task which required them to trace or
draw various forms of a figure-8 before completing a battery
of cognitive tests. Three distinct drawing strategies emerged,
and the tendency to vary these strategies was quantified using
Shannon’s Entropy. The results indicated that participants
employed multiple strategies early in a block of trials before
eventually settling on a preferred strategy. Additionally,
higher creativity scores were associated with higher entropy,
whereas participants with higher verbal and working memory
ability preferred to settle on their preferred strategy.
Keywords: strategy switching; strategy shifting; individual
differences; entropy.

Introduction
When performing tasks, people often encounter
circumstances in which they must change their current
strategy when it becomes problematic. For example, when
weather conditions turn unfavorable, pilots might switch to
an alternate strategy in order to successfully land the plane.
College students may need to switch strategies to succeed in
different courses (e.g., problem solving for math,
memorizing terms for biology, developing motor skills for
music, etc.), and chess players need to switch between an
arsenal of strategies both within and across matches to
consistently win. Different strategies are required for
multitasking in a complex, dynamically changing world.

Old strategies are abandoned and new ones adopted at an
adaptive pace. In order to switch strategies, individuals
presumably must recognize when and why a particular
strategy is failing.
Although, in general, people will retain and use strategies
that proved effective in the past, there are also a number of
motivations for strategy change. It may occur in response to
feedback and performance failure on previous trials (Reder,
1987; Lovett & Anderson, 1996; Brand, 2008). However,
Roberts, Taylor, and Newton (2007) have reported that
individuals persist in utilizing a sub-optimal strategy even
when performance is poor. According to the DunningKruger effect (Kruger & Dunning, 1999), a lack of
metacognitive awareness might inhibit people from
realizing they have selected an inferior strategy. Roberts et
al. (2007) also reported that there needs to be sufficient
motivation before strategy change is likely to occur.
A soft constraints hypothesis (Gray et al., 2006) posits
that people strategically plan more actions in advance when
a task requires longer delay times or controls that are costly
to manipulate. Walsh and Anderson’s (2009) studies of
arithmetic problem-solving suggest people change strategies
when the task becomes excessively difficult or stressful.
These experiences require substantial mental deliberation,
and the harder the task becomes, the more likely a person
will consider a strategy change. This suggests that strategy
selection is more explorative and deliberative prior to
settling on a set strategy (Walsh & Anderson, 2009).

Shifts in strategy are not only associated with the task and
environment, but also by the characteristics of the
individual. Researchers have attempted to identify the
characteristics of people (i.e., individual differences) who
exhibit a propensity for flexible strategy use. Schunn and
Reder (2001) analyzed the Kanfer–Ackerman Air Traffic
Control Task and found that a person’s ability to select and
execute a correct strategy is governed mostly by working
memory capacity and reasoning ability. Reasoning ability
was also correlated with the ability to determine when a
particular strategy was not working. In another study,
Roberts and Roberson (2001) reported that spatial reasoning
ability predicts strategy shifting in spatial tasks.
Although early cognitive research presupposed that
cognitive processes are universal and largely invariant
across individuals and tasks, it is now widely accepted that
aptitudes for specific skills can vary across individuals and
different people recruit different strategies to perform the
same task (e.g. Miller et al., 2002; Schaeken, De Vooght,
Vandierendonck, & d'Ydewalle, 2000). It is conceivable that
cognitive adaptability is a trait necessary to explain the
inherently dynamic nature of cognitive processes as
individuals adjust and adapt their available resources to
ongoing circumstances. Given the variation in the structure
and functioning of the brain, there exists inherent flexibility
that may be quantified and used to predict differences in
cognitive performance among individuals as well as within
a given individual over time. This is the issue that motivated
the present study.
The paradigm selected to elicit and assess strategy change
in the present study was a curve-drawing task, specifically
the drawing and tracing of figure-8s. We systematically
varied the task constraints in order to identify the stable
strategies people use to complete the task. The curvedrawing task was selected because the horizontal and
vertical symmetry allow for consistency when modifying
the stimulus or instructions and analyzing the data.
Moreover, it is a moderately complex task, thereby negating
a potential lack of understanding of the task, which could
inhibit optimal strategy selection (Roberts et al., 2007).
Such a task is also largely free of fluctuations in prior
knowledge or expertise (as opposed to chess, for example),
yet allows for multiple strategies.
Variation in strategy selection across trials was calculated
using Shannon’s Entropy (Shannon, 1948). Originating in
information theory, entropy is a mathematical formulation
of the uncertainty in a data channel. It is expressed as:
( )

∑ ( )

( )

For the current study, is the set of distinct strategies,
and ( ) is the probability of a participant’s use of each
strategy. Higher entropy values indicate more variation in
strategy use across trials; on the other hand, if the same
strategy was used in all trials, then entropy would be 0.
Additionally, the current study measured strategy shifting
within a single task instead of across tasks, which is more

common in the literature (Luwel, Schillemans, Onghena, &
Verschaffel, 2009).

Method
Participants
Participants were 75 undergraduate students, 44 enrolled in
the University of Memphis and 31 at the University of Notre
Dame during the Spring 2009 semester. All participants
participated in the study for course credit.

Apparatus
Participants engaged in a series of tasks that involve tracing
or drawing figure-8s. The primary apparatus was a Wacom
Techno Cintiq 21UXTM system that consisted of an LCD
monitor (43 cm x 33mm). The drawing task was performed
in a subregion measuring approximately 22cm x 22cm. The
system had a synchronization rate of 60 Hz, a response time
of 20 ms, and a maximum report rate of 145 points/sec. The
drawing task was performed with a stylus directly on the
monitor.

Procedure
The experiment was divided into two phases that took
approximately one hour each. The first phase was the curvedrawing task whereas the other was a battery of individual
differences measures.
Curve Drawing. Participants completed a series of
perceptual-motor tasks in which they traced or drew a series
of figure-8s that were displayed on the screen. This was a
within-subjects design in which participants completed each
of 12 conditions designed to stimulate strategy change
within and across each task. Participants first completed a
practice session (Unguided, 5 trials) to familiarize
themselves with the equipment. The next block (Baseline,
25 trials) added visual feedback upon completion of each
trial, namely the speed and accuracy of their drawing,
represented as a percentage, as well as the product of these
two, called the composite score. Subsequent conditions
altered either the target figure or the instructions and
feedback in order to encourage participants to consider
alternate strategies for completing the task. Figure 1
displays a screenshot of the interface, with the speed,
accuracy, and composite score feedback bars for the current
trial, scores for previous trials, and the drawing subregion in
view.
There were several stimulus variation conditions. They
included: random sizes of the figure-8 (Random Size, 50
trials); presenting the figure-8 horizontally and describing it
as an infinity sign (Infinity, 25 trials); displaying various
images (including a figure-8, a five-pointed star, and the
logos for Sandia National Labs and the University of Notre
Dame), then removing the image and asking the participant
to draw the image from memory (Memory, 50 trials); a
figure-8 rotated at various angles, where the participants
were asked to trace the figure in one condition (Angle Trace,

2100

50 trials) and draw the rotated figure-8 in a separate grid in
the other (Angle Draw, 50 each). Examples of the stimuli
are presented in Figures 2 and 3.

Figure 1: Screenshot of curve-drawing interface

instituting a random, unspecified time limit before the trial
would time out, which would result in a composite score of
zero (Trial Timeout, 25 trials).
The Practice and Baseline conditions were always
presented first and second, respectively, followed by either
Speed or Accuracy (counterbalanced), with the remaining
eight conditions following in random order.
Individual differences measures. Following the curvedrawing task, participants completed a battery of tests that
measured various cognitive abilities. Participants selfreported their SAT Reasoning Test or American College
Test (ACT) score (an ACT score was converted to an
equivalent SAT score); all subsequent measures were
administered via computer. These included measures of
working memory (Automated Operation Span Task
(Ospan); Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle, 2005),
creativity (Remote Association Task (RAT); Mednick,
1963), spatial reasoning (Mental Rotation Task; Shepard &
Metzler, 1971), fluid intelligence (Raven’s Progressive
Matrices: Set 1; Raven, 1958), visual search and motor
speed (Figure-Comparison Task; Salthouse & Mitchell,
1990), strategy shifting (Einstellung Water-Jug Strategy
Task; Tresselt & Leeds, 1953), and general verbal ability
(Shipley’s Vocabulary Test; Shipley, 1946).

Figure 4 displays the three strategies exhibited by the
participants. In the figure, the dots refer to where the stylus
first made contact with the screen; a second dot would
indicate that the participant removed the stylus from the
screen and placed it down again. As the stylus moves farther
from the dot, the lines fade to indicate the drawing direction.

Stimulus manipulations may encourage people to switch
strategies, but altering the instructions and feedback may
induce strategy change as well. These modifications
included asking the participants to focus on speed or
accuracy, with feedback scores adjusted accordingly (Speed
and Accuracy, 25 trials each); presenting a standard figure-8
but without any marks from the pen (No Ink, 50 trials);
presenting the next trial at random time intervals (Random
interstimulus interval or Random ISI, 25 trials); and

Strategy A (Circles) was defined as any trial in which a
participant drew one full circle, picked up the stylus, placed
it back on the screen, and drew the other circle. Strategy B
(Middle) was defined as any trial in which the stylus was
originally placed in any intersection point between the
circles, and the figure was completed in one continuous
motion (i.e., without removing and replacing the stylus from
the screen). Finally, Strategy C (Extreme) was defined as
any trial in which the stylus was not originally placed in the

2101

intersection between the circles, and the figure was
completed in one continuous motion. Any trial not fitting
these criteria was classified as ‘Other.’ Table 1 lists the
proportion of observations in which each strategy was used
in each condition.

Quantifying Uncertainty in Strategy Use
We computed the entropy, recurrence, and determinism to
quantify the dynamics of strategy use in each condition.
Recurrence and determinism are measures from dynamical
systems theory and were computed using a categorical auto
recurrence analysis (Richardson, Dale, & Kirkham, 2007).
The recurrence rate (or simply recurrence) provides
repetitiveness of strategy use across trials (higher recurrence
= greater use of a similar set of strategies). Determinism, on
the other hand, measures repetitive patterns in strategy use
(high determinism = more repetitive patterns). Here, entropy
strongly and significantly (p < .05) correlated with
recurrence (r = -.989) and determinism (r = -.862).
Therefore, the subsequent analyses exclusively use entropy.
Our analyses proceeded by assessing whether there were
differences in entropy across conditions. We also expect
variations in entropy within a condition, because when
presented with a new stimulus, we expect participants to
experiment with different strategies before settling on a new
preferred strategy; thus, one prediction is that the entropy
for the final set of trials should be lower than for the initial
trials.
To test this hypothesis, we divided the trials in each
condition into an initial and a final phase. Entropy was
independently computed for each phase. For conditions with
25 trials, initial entropy was computed for trials 1-10 and
final entropy for trials 15-25. For conditions with 50 trials,
initial entropy was computed for trials 1-15 and final
entropy was for trials 25-50.
A 2 × 10 (phase [initial|final] × condition) repeated
measures analysis of variance revealed a significant main
effect for condition, F(9, 666) = 80.21, Mse = .092, p <

.001, partial η2 = .520. Bonferroni posthoc tests indicated
that there was significantly more entropy in the memory
condition than the others (p < .05). This was expected, as
both the stimuli and task were far more complex than any
other condition. Also, the entropy associated with the Angle
Draw condition was significantly greater than the Accuracy,
Infinity, No Ink, Random ISI, Trial Timeout, and Speed
conditions; there were no differences in the other conditions.
There was also a significant main effect for phase, F(1,
74) = 68.67, Mse = .045, p < .001, partial η2 = .837. As
expected, initial entropy was significantly higher than final
entropy, MINITIAL = .579, (SE = .017); MFINAL = .366 (SE =
.020).
The phase × condition interaction was significant, but
yielded a smaller effect, F(9, 666) = 5.746, Mse = .046, p <
.001, partial η2 = .072. With the exception of the memory
condition, final entropy was always lower than initial
entropy. Table 2 displays the initial and final entropy scores
for each condition.

In summary, there is more uncertainty in strategy
selection during the initial trials of each condition and less
uncertainty during the final trials. Additionally, entropy
during the final trials was not zero, indicating that at least
some participants were still switching strategies at the end
of the testing block. Finally, and more importantly, with the
exception of the Memory and Angle Draw conditions,
entropy was consistent across conditions. This indicates that
it is not the task constraints, but individual differences, that
might best explain the patterns in strategy use.

Individual Differences and Entropy
The individual differences measures were correlated with
entropy (see Table 3). Cases that were more than two
standard deviations from the mean were identified as
outliers and removed from the analysis (Van Selst &
Jolicoeur, 1994).
Table 3 shows that verbal ability (Shipley’s Vocabulary
test and SAT), working memory span (Ospan), and
creativity (RAT) correlated with entropy. The negative
correlations between Vocabulary, Ospan, and SAT indicate
that participants with higher verbal ability and executive

2102

function demonstrated less variability in strategy selection.
Some interesting patterns emerge when one considers initial
versus final entropy. Participants with high verbal ability
(Vocabulary and SAT) were more likely to settle on a
preferred strategy (negative correlation with entropy).
Participants with high working memory span (Ospan)
consistently show lower entropy (negative correlation with
both initial and final entropy).
There also seems to be a different pattern in creativity and
intelligence. The RAT shows a positive correlation with
both overall and initial entropy, suggesting a relationship
between creativity and initial exploration. There should be a
note of caution expressed about this measure, however, as
over 40 percent were unable to produce a single correct
answer on the RAT. Hence, it is important that this finding
be replicated with a different sample.

In summary, creativity, vocabulary, and memory span
yielded a medium effect (Cohen, 1992) in predicting the
variability in strategy use. Creative participants were more
likely to shift strategies and explore different strategies,
whereas participants with high verbal ability and memory
span were more likely to persevere in their preferred
strategies.

Predicting Performance
Correlations between the eight individual difference
measures and speed and accuracy scores (the performance
measures) did not yield any significant relationships.
However, there was a significant correlation between
entropy and accuracy (r = -.414, p < .001), but not between
entropy and speed (r = .084). Initially, the negative
correlation between variation in strategy use and accuracy
might sound counterintuitive. However, it is important to
note that strategy switching is usually associated with a
switch cost which people encounter when they attempt to
adjust to the newly adopted strategy (Luwel et al., 2009).
Hence, individuals who switch strategies more (higher
entropy) presumably experienced increased switch costs,
and consequently, lower accuracy scores.

Conclusions

The next set of analyses sought to predict overall entropy,
initial entropy, and final entropy from the individual
difference measures. Only Vocabulary, RAT, and Ospan
were considered because SAT was strongly correlated with
Vocabulary (r = .628). A tolerance analysis indicated there
were no multicollinearity problems (VIF ≈ 1 for all three
predictors). It should also be noted that the sample size was
reduced due to missing data (particularly with Ospan), and
the removal of some outliers. Hence, these regression
models were constructed from the remaining sample of 4045 participants.
A significant model emerged for overall entropy. Here,
F(3, 39) = 3.97, p = .015, R2adj = .175. The significant
predictors were creativity (RAT, β = .266, p = .073) and
memory span (Ospan, β = -.452, p = .003). A better fit (with
one fewer parameter) was obtained if Vocabulary is left out
of the model, F(2, 43) = 6.38, p = .004, R2adj = .193. In
summary, creativity (RAT, β = .284, p = .045) was a
positive predictor of overall variability whereas memory
span (Ospan, β = -.456, p = .002) was a negative predictor.
Similar patterns emerged for initial and final entropy. For
initial entropy, R2adj = .112, RAT: β = .331, p = .030, Ospan:
β = -.290, p = .055. For final entropy, R2adj = .281, RAT: β =
.362, p = .012, Ospan: β = -.374, p = .010, and Vocabulary:
β = .-.332, p = .02.

This study provides new information about what governs
strategy selection, and we have discovered several
interesting results concerning the nature of the task, number
of repetitions of the task, and individual differences. The
two most difficult tasks (Memory and Angle Draw)
exhibited the largest amount of variation in strategy use.
This finding is consistent with Walsh and Anderson’s
(2009) recent findings on arithmetic problem-solving. The
Angle Draw condition was particularly interesting; the
figures were the same as in Angle Trace, but the added
difficulty of drawing (versus tracing) caused a significant
shift in strategy preference (Circles over Middles). These
findings provide evidence that these manipulations were
sufficiently difficult to promote cognitive restructuring on
some level.
Within a task, people tend to explore different strategies
early in the task before eventually settling on a preferred
strategy. Also, there are some individual differences in
cognitive ability that are associated with more strategy
shifting; creative people are more likely to explore different
strategies, whereas those with a high working memory span
and reasoning/verbal ability tend to identify a preferred
strategy and perseverate with it. Perhaps the latter
individuals are quick problem-solvers and identify their
preferred strategy immediately, while creative individuals
are more willing to perseverate with multiple strategies until
they are satisfied.
Although this study has provided some insight into
strategy exploration both within the same task and across
tasks, it remains to be seen whether these findings hold true
when people are encouraged to change their strategy as a

2103

result of a change in the task (i.e., adaptive strategy
shifting). This could be achieved by either drastically
altering the task, where the necessity for a strategy change
would be distinct and instantaneous, or by slowly modifying
the task such that the exact moment one strategy becomes
superior is much more nebulous. Additionally, measuring
the time between stimulus presentation and task execution
would provide a metric of planning strategy selection, which
might be a predictor of strategy shifting.
Finally, Rakow, Newell, & Zougkou (2010) describe a
recent model where certain people exploited the constraints
of the task, whereas others were more exploratory in their
strategy use. Although this model did not explicitly address
creativity, one possibility is that the creative individuals
might be more likely to exhibit exploratory behaviors, a
possibility which is tentatively supported by the present data
but requires more systematic experimental validation.
