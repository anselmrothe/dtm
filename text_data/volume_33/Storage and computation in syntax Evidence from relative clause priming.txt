   has been less forthcoming. We approach this question using            as well. In the domain of words, there is evidence for
   syntactic priming, a method exploiting the tendency of                storage of even fully regular morphological structure across
   individuals to repeat syntactic structures that they have             a variety of languages and morphological systems.

needed for composing meaning. Across different classes of
grammatical theories these minimal fragments of structure
have sometimes been represented with devices such as
context-free grammar rules (e.g., S  NP VP; NP  Det N;
Sag, Wasow, & Bender, 2003), basic combinatory types
(Steedman, 2000), immediate word-word dependencies
(e.g., Mel’čuk, 1988), or basic “merge” operations (e.g.,
