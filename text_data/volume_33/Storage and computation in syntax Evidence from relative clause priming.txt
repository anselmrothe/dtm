Abstract

many or all of the utterances and combinations of structure
that they have ever encountered, increasing the number of
items that must be stored in memory but decreasing the
amount of computation required to process utterances.
Where does natural language fall on this continuum?
Structures that are idiosyncratic or non-compositional—
such as idioms and monomorphemic words—must be stored
(Bloomfield, 1933). A more controversial question is
whether fully compositional structures are sometimes stored
as well. In the domain of words, there is evidence for
storage of even fully regular morphological structure across
a variety of languages and morphological systems.
Examples include English verbal morphology (Alegre &
Gordon, 1999), English noun pluralization (Sereno &
Jongman, 1997), Italian and Dutch noun pluralization
(Baayen et al., 1997a; Baayen et al., 1997b) and Finnish
case and number marking (Bertram et al., 1999).
In syntax, the evidence for storage of compositional
structure is less certain. Although a number of recent
theoretical proposals in linguistics and psycholinguistics
have advocated the idea that fully compositional syntactic
structures can be stored (e.g., Jackendoff, 2002; Goldberg,
2005) it has proven difficult to obtain experimental evidence
for such storage. Several recent studies have shown
evidence for storage of long sequences of words (Bod,
2001; Bannard and Matthews, 2008; Tremblay, 2009;
Arnon & Snider, 2010). These results show that storage is
pervasive, even for fully compositional structure above the
word level. However, while these results are important and
suggestive, they fall short of providing evidence for the
storage of complex abstract syntactic structures.
Here, we provide experimental evidence that the linguistic
system stores complex syntactic structures that combine
both abstraction and lexical specificity. To do this we
investigate object-extracted relative clause constructions
(ORCs). The nature of ORCs, in particular, makes them an

In morphology, researchers have provided compelling
evidence for the storage of even fully compositional
structures that could otherwise be computed by rule. For
example, a high-frequency word composed of multiple
morphemes (e.g., root + plural inflection) may be stored
directly rather than computed on the fly (e.g., Baayen,
Dijkstra, & Schreuder, 1997). Here, we investigate similar
questions of storage and computation in syntax, a domain in
which evidence of storage of fully compositional structures
has been less forthcoming. We approach this question using
syntactic priming, a method exploiting the tendency of
individuals to repeat syntactic structures that they have
recently produced (Bock, 1986). As a test case, we investigate
relative clauses (RCs). RCs are both abstract and syntactically
complex but are nevertheless frequent in natural language
(Roland, Dick, & Elman, 2007). Moreover, differences in
processing complexity between different RC types are at least
partially predicted by frequency (e.g., Reali & Christiansen,
2007). RCs are therefore an ideal domain to look for evidence
of storage of abstract, compositional syntactic structure. If the
structures underlying high-frequency RC types are stored and
retrieved from memory as whole units instead of being
computed online from smaller units, then these stored
structures should be susceptible to priming. Across three
experiments, we observed that priming of object-extracted
RCs is sensitive to a) the type of noun phrase in the embedded
subject position (a full NP vs. a pronoun), and b) the type of
relative pronoun (who vs. that). These results suggest that the
representations of some types of RCs involve storage of large
units which include both syntactic and lexical information.
We interpret these results as providing support for models of
syntax that allow for complex mixtures of storage and
computation.

Introduction
An important open question in the study of language
involves the nature of the syntactic representations that are
stored in long-term memory. At one extreme, the language
user might only store the smallest fragments of structure
needed for composing meaning. Across different classes of
grammatical theories these minimal fragments of structure
have sometimes been represented with devices such as
context-free grammar rules (e.g., S  NP VP; NP  Det N;
Sag, Wasow, & Bender, 2003), basic combinatory types
(Steedman, 2000), immediate word-word dependencies
(e.g., Mel’čuk, 1988), or basic “merge” operations (e.g.,
Chomsky, 1995). Processing a sentence using only these
minimal units would require accessing large numbers of
these stored “items” (rules) from long-term memory and
combining them on-the-fly to create or infer new complex
meanings. At the other extreme, language users might store

Figure 2: Granularity of potentially stored ORC structures
ideal test case for investigating the granularity of the
syntactic units that are stored. An ORC modifies a head
noun which has been extracted from the object position of
the RC. For instance, in the sentence, “The man that I met
yesterday was at the basketball game,” the ORC “that I met
yesterday” modifies the head noun “the man”, which is coreferential with the empty object of the verb “met”. RCs
therefore involve an abstract structure with an embedded
clause, a constituent that has been displaced, and several
other syntactic positions (see Figure 1).
Previous work on relative clause attachment provides
some evidence for priming (and storage) of abstract
syntactic structure (Scheepers, 2003). However, one
important question is whether the linguistic system stores
information about specific lexical items together with this
abstract structure. Fig. 2 illustrates the same ORC under
three different storage strategies/hypotheses. These range
from a strategy which is maximally combinatorial (Fig. 2a),
to a strategy where all lexical information is stored together
with the abstract syntactic structure (Fig. 2b), to an
intermediate case including some lexical content but still
allowing for variability in several of the syntactic positions
(2c).
Our experiments contrasted two structural variants of
ORCs: (1) ORCs with a pronoun versus a definite NP in the
embedded subject position (see Figure 3a vs 3c), and (2)
ORCs with that versus who as relative pronoun (see Figure
3a vs 3b).
Reali & Christiansen (2007) observed that ORCs with a
personal pronoun in subject position (henceforth,
“pronominal ORCs,” e.g., Fig. 3a-3b) are more frequent
than ORCs with a definite NP in subject position (“definiteNP ORCs,” e.g. Fig. 3c). Reali and Christiansen also found
that pronominal ORCs are read faster than matched
pronominal SRCs, which are typically considered to be less
syntactically complex (see also Warren & Gibson, 2002).
We therefore hypothesized that greater priming of ORCs
would be observed when the prime contains a pronominal
ORC (compared to a definite-NP ORC).
Roland et al. (2007) further observed that ORCs occur
more frequently following inanimate head NPs, compared to
animate head NPs (see Traxler et al., 2002; Mak et al., 2002,
for reading time evidence suggesting that ORCs with
inanimate head NPs are processed faster than those with

animate head NPs). Because the relative pronoun that can
refer to either animate or inanimate NPs, but the relative
pronoun who can only refer to animate NPs, we
hypothesized that ORCs might be more likely to occur with
the relative pronoun that, compared to who. This hypothesis
was confirmed by a corpus study. We searched the
Switchboard, Brown, and WSJ corpora from the Treebank-2
distribution (Marcus, Santorini, & Marcinkiewicz, 1995)
and found that in each corpus, less than 1.5% of all ORCs
occurred with who. In contrast, between 36% and 88% of
ORCs in each corpus occurred with that. We therefore
hypothesized that greater priming of ORCs would be
observed when the prime contains an ORC with the relative
pronoun that (compared to the relative pronoun who).
We conducted three sentence-completion experiments in
which participants were instructed to form complete English
sentences from short preambles (see e.g., Scheepers, 2003;
Desmet & Declercq, 2006). We first present the results from
two experiments run in the lab. We then present the results
from a more rigorous third experiment, which was
conducted partially in the lab and partially by using a webbased crowd-sourcing method. In both the lab and in webbased experiments, we find evidence for joint storage of
syntactic and lexical information for frequent types of ORCs
(i.e., pronominal ORCs and ORCs with that as a relative
pronoun).

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 was conducted to establish that ORCs elicit a
priming effect (i.e., that they are produced with greater
frequency after ORC primes than after other types of
primes) and to test whether this effect might be greater for
pronominal ORCs compared to definite-NP ORCs.

Methods
Participants Thirty-two native English speakers were
recruited from the MIT community. They were paid at a rate
of $10/hour.
Design and materials The experiment had four prime
conditions: a baseline prime (a definite NP); an SRC prime
(a definite NP + the relative pronoun who + a transitive
verb); a definite-NP ORC prime (a definite NP + who + the

determiner the); and a pronominal ORC prime (a definite
NP + who + the personal pronoun you or I). Critically, in all
but the baseline prime condition the participant was forced
into an SRC or ORC completion. Each prime was followed
by a target preamble consisting of a definite NP followed by
who, in order to force a relative clause completion of the
target preamble. A sample item is given in (1):

Prime-target pairs were excluded if either the prime
preamble or the target preamble was left blank or not
completed as a complete grammatical English sentence,
affecting 15.36% of the data. We used the proportion of
ORCs produced in the targets as the critical dependent
measure. An overall SRC bias is to be expected in the RC
completions given that SRCs are more frequent than ORCs
(e.g., Roland et al., 2007).
Indeed, participants
overwhelmingly completed target preambles with SRCs;
across conditions, only 2.77% of target preambles were
completed with ORCs. The mean proportion and standard
error of the mean for each condition, along with the relevant
χ2 values and p-values for each proportion test, are
displayed in Table 1. The proportion tests that reached
significance (p < .05) are displayed in boldface, and those
that approached significance (p < .10) are in italic boldface.
Experiment 1 suggested priming of pronominal ORCs with
the relative pronoun who (see Figure 4a). In Experiment 2,
we attempted to replicate this finding with the relative
pronoun that.

(1) a. Baseline prime
The screenwriter…
b. SRC prime
The screenwriter who noticed…
c. Definite-NP ORC prime
The screenwriter who the…
d. Pronominal ORC prime
The screenwriter who you / I…
e. Target
The marine who…
Twenty-four such items were created. Each participant
only saw one version of each item (i.e., of each prime-target
pair), according to a Latin Square design. Items were
interleaved among 160 short filler preambles, in addition to
16 prime-target preamble pairs from an unrelated priming
experiment, for a total of 240 sentences. Between three and
five filler preambles appeared between each prime-target
pair (following Desmet & Declercq, 2006). Subject to these
constraints, four randomized lists of sentence preambles
were created. Four additional lists were created by
reversing the order of the trials in each list, for a total of
eight lists distributed evenly among participants.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we had two goals. First, we wished to
investigate the priming of ORCs containing that as relative
pronoun. Second, we wanted to rule out a potential
alternative explanation for the priming effect observed in
Experiment 1. In particular, we wanted to test whether the
presence of a pronoun in any RC, rather than in the subject
position of an ORC specifically, might explain the priming
effect. We therefore included a pronominal SRC condition,
which contained a personal pronoun (you or I) in the
embedded object position. Furthermore, we added another
control (a complement clause prime condition) to test
whether any embedded clause with a pronoun might be
sufficient to elicit a greater proportion of ORC production in
targets.

Procedure Participants were given a booklet containing the
240 sentence preambles and were instructed to form full
sentences by completing each preamble with the first
continuation that came to mind. They were instructed not to
be too original or creative, but rather to be spontaneous and
to write down the first thing they thought of. They were
also prompted to move quickly through the experiment and
to complete the sentence beginnings in the order that they
were presented in. The experiment took between 45
minutes and an hour to complete.

proportion and standard error of the mean for each
condition, along with the relevant χ2 values and p-values for
each proportion test, are displayed in Table 1.
In summary, we observed priming of ORCs in both
pronominal and definite-NP ORC conditions in Experiment
2 (see Figure 4b). This is in contrast to Experiment 1, in
which only pronominal ORCs elicited priming.
Furthermore, rates of ORC production across conditions
were higher in Experiment 2, plausibly due to the use of the

Participants Twenty-nine native English speakers were
recruited from the MIT community. They were paid at a rate
of $10/hour.
Design and materials Given the extremely low base rate of
ORC production across conditions in Experiment 1, no
baseline condition was included in Experiment 2. We
hypothesized that the complement clause prime condition
would result in the lowest proportion of ORCs in the targets,
and could thus serve as the new baseline condition. The
experiment had five prime conditions: a definite-NP SRC
prime (a definite NP + that + a transitive verb); a
pronominal SRC prime (a definite NP + that + a transitive
verb + the personal pronoun you or me + a preposition1); a
complement clause prime (a definite NP + a sentential
complement verb + that + the personal pronoun you or I); a
definite-NP ORC prime (a definite NP + that + the); and a
pronominal ORC prime (a definite NP + that + the personal
pronoun you or me). As in experiment 1, each prime was
followed by a target, as in (2f):
(2) a. Complement clause prime (baseline)
The screenwriter said that you / I…
b. Definite-NP SRC prime
The screenwriter that noticed…
c. Pronominal SRC prime
The screenwriter that noticed you / me by…
d. Definite-NP ORC prime
The screenwriter that the…
e. Pronominal ORC prime
The screenwriter that you / I…
f. Target
The marine that…
Thirty such items were created. Each participant saw one
version of each item (i.e., of each prime-target pair),
according to a Latin Square design. Items were interleaved
among 120 short filler preambles, for a total of 180
sentences.
Between three and five filler preambles
intervened between each prime-target pair. Subject to these
constraints, five randomized lists were created. Five
additional lists were created by reversing the order of the
trials in each list, for a total of ten lists distributed
approximately evenly among participants.

Table 1: Experiments 1-3 statistics

Procedure
The procedure was identical to that of
Experiment 1.

Results and Discussion
As in Experiment 1, only trials on which both the prime and
target preambles were fully completed as intended were
included in the analysis. This led to exclusion of 14.44% of
the data. The base rate of ORC production (7.92%) was
higher in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1. The mean

The preposition was included so that participants would be
required to produce some portion of the RC in all of the RC primes
(a-d).

relative pronoun that (χ2 = 16.846, p < .0001). In
Experiment 3, we sought to replicate the effects observed in
Experiments 1 and 2 including all the critical manipulations
in the same design, increasing the number of participants by
using a web-based crowd-sourcing service.

Design and Materials The design of Experiment 3 was as
described above. A sample item is given in (3):
(3)

a. Definite-NP baseline prime
The…
b. Pronominal baseline prime
You / I…
c. Definite-NP ORC prime
The screenwriter (who / that) the…
d. Pronominal ORC prime
The screenwriter (who / that) you / I…
e. Definite-NP complement clause prime
The screenwriter said that the…
f. Pronominal complement clause prime
The screenwriter said that you…
g. Target
The marine (who / that)…
Thirty such items were created, and 120 short filler
preambles were also used in this experiment. Preambles
were randomized as in Experiments 1-2.

Experiment 3
Experiment 3 used a fully crossed design, manipulating the
NP type (full NP vs. pronoun) and structure of the prime
(baseline vs. ORC vs. complement clause). In addition,
relative pronoun (who vs. that) was manipulated between
subjects. Given the small effect sizes in Experiments 1-2,
Experiment 3 included a web-based component.
In
particular, we first conducted two experiments (with who,
and with that) with similar numbers of subjects as in
Experiments 1-2 in the lab (Experiment 3A-who and
Experiment 3A-that). We then ran the same experiments
using Amazon.com’s Mechanical AMT service (henceforth
referred to as “AMT”) in order to a) gather data from a
larger number of subjects, and b) validate the production
priming method on AMT (see e.g., Munro, 2010, for
validation of other experimental paradigms on AMT).
These web-based experiments are referred to as Experiment
3B-who and Experiment 3B-that.

Procedure
For the two lab-based experiments, the
procedure was identical to that of Experiments 1 and 2. For
the AMT-based experiments, the procedure was also
identical to the previous experiments, except that the
preambles were presented electronically over Amazon.com
Mechanical AMT’s user interface, and subjects typed their
responses rather than writing them by hand.

Methods
Participants Thirty-six native English speakers recruited
from the MIT community participated in Experiment 3Awho; 36 additional speakers from the same subject pool
participated in Experiment 3A-that. These participants were
paid at the rate of $10/hour for their time.
For the AMT studies, participants were excluded from
analyses if they did not complete the entire experiment or if
they were not native English speakers. This left 111 (out of
120) participants for Experiment 3B-who and 109 (out of
120) participants for Experiment 3Bthat. AMT participants

Results and Discussion
As in Experiments 1 and 2, trials were excluded if either the
prime or target preamble was not fully completed as
intended. This led to exclusion of 6.2% (Experiment 3Awho), 3.2% (Experiment 3A-that), 13.8% (Experiment 3Bwho), and 5.1% (Experiment 3B-that) of the data,
respectively.

For each of the experiments, two-sample proportion tests
were conducted for each condition against the definite-NP
baseline condition from the relevant experiment. The mean
proportion and standard error of the mean for each
condition, along with the relevant χ2 values and p-values for
each proportion test, are displayed in Table 2. The
proportion tests that reached significance (p < .05) are
displayed in boldface. In addition, the means and SEs for
the average of ORC production for each experiment are
shown.
As in Experiment 1, the two studies run on AMT
(Experiment 3B) showed a significant effect of ORC
priming, but only for the pronominal ORC (and not the
definite-NP ORC) conditions (see Figure 4e-f). We did not
observe an effect of ORC priming in Experiment 3A (see
Figure 4c-d).
An additional two-sample proportion test was conducted
across experiments to investigate the total number of ORC
target completions following definite NP primes and
pronominal primes. The mean proportion of ORC targets
following definite-NP ORC primes was .0890 (SE = .0079),
and the mean proportion of ORC targets following
pronominal ORC primes was .1200 (SE = .0089). This
difference was significant (χ2 = 6.434, p = .0112).
In addition, a large effect of relative pronoun was
observed. Collapsing across all conditions of both of the
that experiments, the mean proportion of ORC targets
produced was .1334 (SE = .0053) compared to a mean of
.0378 (SE = .0031) ORC targets in the who experiments.
This effect was highly significant by a paired-sample
proportion test, χ2 = 227.072, p < .0001.

indicate that some abstract syntactic structure was primed in
both cases. We leave it to future work to consider this as a
plausible explanation for the production frequency and
priming differences put forth in this paper.
Our results cannot be reduced to the priming of a lexical
element (i.e., the embedded subject pronoun or the relative
pronoun) alone, as we do not observe increased production
of ORCs in conditions with only a personal pronoun (e.g.,
the pronominal SRC, pronominal complement clause, and
pronominal baseline conditions of Experiments 2-3).
Furthermore, our results cannot be reduced to priming of a
lexical item + embedded clause (e.g., that + embedded
complement clause of any sort), as we do not observe
increased production of ORCs after a complementizer and
its complement clause (e.g., the “complementizer clause”
conditions of Experiments 2-3). It appears that both the
lexical element in a particular syntactic position and the
abstract syntactic structure(s) underlying object relative
clauses must be present for the priming to take place.
These results provide strong support for theories of
syntactic structure which allow for the storage of a wide
variety of both abstract and lexically-specific structures at
different levels of granularity, even when the structures are
fully compositional (e.g., Jackendoff, 2002; Goldberg,
2005). Of course, once the possibility of such storage is
admitted, two natural questions arise: which structures are
stored and why? One promising possibility is that the
storage versus computation decision is the result of
optimization of a tradeoff. Some tradeoff-based theories
view the tradeoff in terms of computational resources; time
spent computing can be reduced at the cost of space in
memory and vice versa (e.g., Baayen, et al. 2007a). Under
such theories high-frequency combinations of items may be
stored as chunks in order to facilitate fast processing.
Another recent proposal, O'Donnell (2011), takes a different
view on the nature of the tradeoff. Under this approach, the
tradeoff is viewed in terms of optimal predictions about
productivity and reuse. The system optimizes its ability to
predict future reuse of combinations of structure, while
determining which parts of the system will be able to
productively generate novel structures. We leave it to future
work to explore these different possibilities.

General Discussion
In this set of studies, we have provided the first evidence
for priming of object relative clauses (ORCs). We have
shown that the priming of ORCs is sensitive to the type of
the NP in the embedded subject position (definite NP vs.
pronoun) and the relative pronoun (who vs. that), two
factors that have been also shown to affect (i) production
frequencies, and (ii) processing complexity. These results
are of special interest because an ORC is a complex and
abstract syntactic structure involving an embedded clause, a
displaced constituent, and a number of other syntactic
positions (a possible representation is shown in Figure 2a).
Although there are many accounts of syntactic priming
(including transient activation, implicit learning, and
pragmatic alignment; see Ferreira & Bock, 2006, for a
recent review), all of them rely on the assumption that the
primed element (or elements) must be stored in order to be
primed. Our results imply that (some parts of) this complex
ORC structure must be stored together with specific lexical
items such as that or you. We recognize that some syntactic
theories hold that who and that occupy different syntactic
positions within an RC. Thus, it is possible that the abstract
syntactic structures primed in the who and that conditions
were not identical.
Although this may complicate
comparison between these two conditions, our results still
