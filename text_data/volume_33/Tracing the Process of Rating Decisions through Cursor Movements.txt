                              Abstract
   To study the decision process during rating tasks, PC cursor
  trajectories were recorded and analyzed. The trajectories were
  often successions of rapid saccadic-like movements that are
  called strokes in this paper. The analysis of strokes revealed
  that the distribution of strokes differed across tasks as a
  function of task difficulty. A simple number matching task
  elicited fewer strokes, shorter response times, and velocity
  patterns resembling simple ballistic reaching movements. A
  personality rating task tended to elicit multiple strokes and
  longer RTs, which caused a typical inverted-U RT effect. The
  shape and speed of tangential velocity of trajectories may
  reflect participant’s internal states, especially when cognitive
  loads are high.
