Abstract: In the present study, we used feature lists in a categorization task and required participants to report
their subjective confidence to examine the dissociation between explicit and implicit knowledge. Whereas our findings
replicated the effect of prior knowledge on learning, our results challenge the role of explicit and implicit knowledge
suggested by previous research using a similar paradigm. We argue that measures that consider all confidence
responses, referred to as calibration indices, are required to understand the contributions of implicit and explicit
knowledge in any task.
