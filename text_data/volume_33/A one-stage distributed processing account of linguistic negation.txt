“I sure excelled in that class,” said by a student who just
learned that his course grade was a D. It can also be coded
with affixes, such as the prefix “non-“, as in “The
nonexistence of rules worries me.” It can also be coded
with words such as “not”, “none”, and “without”. Despite
the ubiquity of negation, its processing has perplexed
philosophers for centuries. There is still a relatively poor
understanding of how people contend with the meaning of
simple negated statements such as “The eagle is not in the
sky”.

negated utterance has generated recent interest among
psycholinguists. In pioneering work, Kaup, Yaxley,

targets did not expressly tell the network that these two
meanings were different in any way. However, looking at
these trajectories, it appears that the network emergently
decided that this particular negation should not activate the
happy feature that the equivalent affirmative meaning
activates. Thus, this network is capable of negating
sentences and finding a meaning where primary features are
extremely similar in their activations, but other less active
features are susceptible to quirks, resulting in subtle, but
quantifiable, flavoring differences. The tiny activations
surrounding the major primarily activated features create the
majority of flexibility in this system, while the primary
features constrain and ensure similar interpretations for each
sentence.
