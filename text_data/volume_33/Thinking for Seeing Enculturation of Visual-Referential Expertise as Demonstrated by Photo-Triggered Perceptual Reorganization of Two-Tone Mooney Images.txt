  viewing the photographs from which two-tones were created,
  adults experience rapid “perceptual reorganization,” and the
  two-tones become immediately recognizable. In contrast to
  the effortless post-cue recognition seen in adults, preschool-
  aged children are generally unable to recognize two-tone
  images even when the photograph is simultaneously
  available. While simple instructional and perceptual
  interventions were ineffective, a cognitive intervention in

  images were transformations of the same physical object

  recognition in adults from a hunter-gatherer tribe (Pirahã)

  modern       visual      media.     Photo-triggered    perceptual

One hypothesis to explain the lack of perceptual
reorganization in young children is that their early visual
system is not yet mature, perhaps due to a lack of fully
developed long-range connections. Another hypothesis for
children’s deficient perceptual reorganization is that using
the photograph as a cue for reorganization requires an
appreciation of the dual nature of the photograph as both a
concrete object in and of itself, and a representation of
something else—the two-tone image. This skill is a form of
visual-referential expertise entrained by a visual symbolic
culture typical in the US. For example, we “read” visual
symbols such as representational art, maps and models, and           Figure 3:Full stimulus set used in Experiment 1 including

triggered two-tone reorganization requires a representational
override. A conviction that the two highly dissimilar visual
objects are transformations of one another is one way to
trigger this perceptual override. This practice of perceptual
revision, a habit of reinterpreting images when receiving
information extrinsic to the image, is part of what may be
entrained in a visual symbolic culture and may explain why,
by adulthood, a transformation cover story is no longer
necessary.
   Further research should identify what cognitive skills are
entrained by visual symbolic cultures, and how such
enculturation may influence other practices of perceptual
inference and interpretation necessary for photo-triggered
perceptual reorganization.
