Abstract: Spatial inferences during wayfindign could be closely related to spatial learning. We examined the
effects of regularity in the inferences on learning of relative locations through wayfinding in the context of available
information about an environment. In the experiment using a real maze, participants visited multiple targets in one
of four conditions by a combination of two factors: an updating mode (regular or irregular) and an environmental
information (with or without global landmarks). The results suggest that although the global landmarks facilitate
the learning regardless of the updating modes, the difference in the regularity produces opposite effects depending
on the landmark conditions. While the irregular updating, which involves multidirectional self-to-object updating,
has a facilitation effect when the landmark information is available, it impedes the learning without the landmarks.
The regular updating, which would allow a relatively easier wayfinding strategy facilitates the learning only in the
latter condition.
