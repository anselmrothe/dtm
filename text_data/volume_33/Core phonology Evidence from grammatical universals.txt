offers specific, amply testable hypotheses concerning those
principles. In this account, all grammars include a common
set of markedness constraints that express (dis)preferences
for certain linguistic structures (e.g., structure A≻B). These
constraints form part of the grammars of all speakers,
irrespective of whether the structures under consideration
(e.g., A, B) are present in one’s language or absent.
   In this talk, I summarize the results of an experimental
research program that tests of this hypothesis. I proceed in
two steps. First, I demonstrate that individual speakers’
preferences mirror the language typology. I next gauge the
source of these preferences by pitting universal-grammatical
explanations against various extra-grammatical alternatives.             Figure 1: The link between sonority cline of onsets, their

languages, onsets such as bl are preferred (e.g., they are                      identity tasks (Berent et al., 2007; 2008).
