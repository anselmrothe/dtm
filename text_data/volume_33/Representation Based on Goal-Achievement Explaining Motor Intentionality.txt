Abstract: Whether motor intentionality needs representation is debated, and what sense of representation it is
needs clarification. Dreyfus (2000, 2002) interprets Merleau-Ponty’s notion of motor intentionality as different signif-
icantly from that in traditional cognitive science, and argues for intelligence without representation. The involving
intelligence is demonstrated in Freeman’s (1991) attractor theory. By contrast, Clark (1997, 2002, 2003), Christensen
& Hooker (2000, 2002), Grush (2004), Keijzer (2001), and Pezzulo (2008) argue for the need of representation for the
motor intentionality. In the debate, a question needs answer: is there a naturalistic account of the motor intention-
ality? To answer this question, the present project raises a naturalistic account of motor intentionality, on grounds
of goal-setting and goal-achievement with recourse to the bodily movement. The present project argues that the
motor representation can even be demonstrated in an architecture based on the dynamic field theory, a version of
the attractor theory.
