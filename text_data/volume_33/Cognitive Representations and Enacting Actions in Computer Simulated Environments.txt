results also revealed that when coordinating actions on
behalf of the virtual human, people had a greater tendency
to choose cut locations that would more likely result in
injury.
    In the current experiments, we extend our previous
research by examining whether providing auditory
component to a computer-simulated environment might
increase presence and thus mitigating the risk taking
tendencies mentioned above. We adopted the general
methodology as in our previous work just mentioned.
Experiment 1 was a replication study and was used to assess
baseline performances in the real environment. We
replicated the previous finding, in that those coordinating
actions on behalf of the avatar chose cut locations that had a
greater likelihood of producing injury. Two subsequent
experiments were then conducted in which we simply added
