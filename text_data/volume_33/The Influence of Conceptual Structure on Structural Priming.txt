Figure 2 shows the proportion of use of coded syntactic
frames in participants’ motion event descriptions. In the
absence of a prime sentence, speakers produced the
Canonical frame more often than any other frame; they
never produced sentences that used the Complex Subject
frame; and they used the Complex VP frame about 14% of
the time. When primed with the Complex Subject frame
