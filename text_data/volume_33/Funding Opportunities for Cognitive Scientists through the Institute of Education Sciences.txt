Cognitive Science Society membership. NCER’s
“Cognition and Student Learning” aims to establish a
scientific foundation for education by building on
theoretical and empirical advances in cognitive science and
applying them to education practice with the goal of
improving student learning and academic achievement.
NCSER’s “Cognition and Student Learning in Special
Education” seeks to apply recent advances in cognitive
science to improve developmental outcomes for infants and
toddlers with or at risk for disabilities and learning for
students with or at risk for disabilities. Through each of
these programs, the Institute supports research that utilizes
cognitive science to develop, implement, and evaluate
approaches intended to improve teaching and learning in
authentic education settings.
    In general, research funded by the Institute focuses on
improving learning and academic achievement, as well as
reducing the achievement gap between high- and low-
performing students and increasing access to postsecondary
education. The Institute funds research in a variety of
ongoing and new grant programs relevant to cognitive
processes in typical students and children with disabilities.
Topics include autism spectrum disorders; reading, writing,
and language development; mathematics and science
education; early learning and intervention; education
technology; and others. In addition to the development and
evaluation of effective education programs, IES funds
