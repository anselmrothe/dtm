Abstract: Not a great deal is known about the electrophysiology of category learning. In our study, one group of
participants learned novel categories of tropical fish, an exposure group viewed the same stimuli without learning
any categories, and a control group did not see the stimuli. All three groups then viewed a sequence of quadruples of
fish while their EEG was recorded. In half the quadruples (”different”), the first three fish were from one category
and the fourth was from the other, while in the other half (”same”), all four fish were from the same category. All
three groups also rated the similarity of many pairs of stimuli. Learners rated same-category fish as more similar
than the other groups (a ”compression” effect) and initial analyses of the EEG data suggest that the effect of same
vs. different quadruples on the ERP pattern in the P300 time window varied according to group.
