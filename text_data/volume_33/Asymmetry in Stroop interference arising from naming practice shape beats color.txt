Abstract
Stroop interference is characterized by strong asymmetry between word and color naming such that the former is faster and
interferes with the latter but not vice versa. This asymmetry
is attributed to differential experience with naming in the two
dimensions, i.e., words and colors. Here we show that training on a visual-verbal paired associate task equivalent to color
and shape naming leads to strongly asymmetric interference
patterns. 28 adults practiced naming colors and novel shapes,
one dimension more extensively (10 days) than the other (2
days), using nonsense syllables. Despite equal training, color
naming was strongly affected by shape even after extensive
practice, whereas shape naming was more resistant to interference. To reconcile these findings with theoretical accounts
of interference, reading may be conceptualized as involving
visual-verbal associations akin to “shape naming.” An inherent advantage for naming shapes may provide an evolutionary
substrate for the invention and development of reading.

Asymmetry in Stroop Interference
Stroop interference (Stroop, 1935) is commonly considered
to be among the most familiar, most cited, and most investigated phenomena in all of cognitive psychology. It is well
established that it takes longer to name the color in which a
word is printed when the word means a different color (e.g.
the word “red” printed in green ink), whereas it makes no difference in reading the word what color it is printed in. A complete explanation of this basic asymmetry remains elusive.
MacLeod (1991) surveyed the landscape two decades ago
and charted a list of challenges for future theorists. A number of comprehensive accounts have approached the topic
from different angles, including automaticity (Cohen, Dunbar, & McClelland, 1990), attentional filtering (Phaf, Van der
Heuden, & Hudson, 1990) or conflict monitoring (Botvinick,
Braver, Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001) in connectionist networks; information theoretical considerations (Melara & Algom, 2003); and verification (Roelofs, 2003) or utility learning (Lovett, 2005) in goal-directed production systems.
All of these accounts, in one way or another, are concerned
with the strong asymmetry observed between color naming
and word reading, and between their relative interference and
facilitation effects. Crucially, the source of the asymmetry is
entirely experience-dependent in these approaches. That is,
reading interferes with color naming rather than vice versa
due to the extensive history of reading compared to color
naming, that is, greater practice in the word naming dimen-

sion (MacLeod, 1991, p. 182). Lovett (2005, p. 496) suggested that “utility” mediates the effects of practice, a distinction of consequence only when competing processes differ
in task efficiency. In the “tectonic theory,” dimensional imbalance arises from access efficiency gradients in long-term
memory due to developmental history, namely processing experiences, such as perceptual experiences with words and associated oral responses (Melara & Algom, 2003, p. 430).
When a structural asymmetry is posited, it is specific to
the nature of reading having to do with direct associations
between written and spoken word forms through verbal processes. In the model of Phaf et al. (1990), the asymmetry
was introduced ad hoc, to account for the “privileged status” of inherent compatibility between written and spoken
words (p. 310). Likewise, Roelofs (2003) posits an inherent privilege for written words, accessing their stored lemmata and spoken word forms directly. In contrast, shape and
color naming is conceptually mediated and initially symmetric. Extensive practice may support the formation of direct
links between shapes or colors and the corresponding naming
responses, thus becoming “similar to reading aloud” (p. 117).
Thus, in every current model of interference between two processing dimensions, practice is the crucial factor behind the
dimensional imbalance that determines the interference.

Specific Effects of Training
A surprisingly small number of studies have examined the
development or malleability of interference through practice.
MacLeod (1998) found reduction of interference but no reverse interference (from incongruent color to word naming),
despite 5 or 10 days of training on color naming, attesting
to the robustness of the asymmetry. MacLeod and Dunbar
(1988) trained partcipants to respond to familiar shapes with
color names, in a visual-verbal paired associate learning task
using color words. The resulting “shape naming” was vulnerable to interference from incongruent colors in the early
stages of training but the asymmetry was eventually reversed:
After 20 days of practice, color names for the shapes interfered with regular color naming, consistent with a practicebased account of interference, in which the novel shape-word
pairings became sufficiently automatic to cause interference.
Pritchatt (1968) trained participants to respond with nonsense syllables to colors in a paired-associate learning task,
and then tested for interference in naming color patches and

2150

the same nonsense syllables printed in color, replicating the
interference effect with the newly formed color “names”
(Exp. 3, p. 356). Asymmetric interference effects arose in
comparison to a condition in which participants learned the
reverse associations, that is, responding with color names to
nonsense syllables; however the relative magnitude of the
effects was not examined. Glaser and Dolt (1977, Exp. 2)
trained participants to respond with nonsense syllables to colors and to color words, introducing an additional step of presumed association. This caused substantial and equal interference in both directions, eliminating any asymmetry. Unfortunately it is not known precisely how much each dimension
was practiced, because participants were simply instructed to
overlearn the dimensions within a week at their leisure.

Rationale of the Present Study
The aforementioned findings indicate that novel pairedassociate learning may lend itself to investigation of the development of Stroop interference. In particular we are interested in the origin of the fundamental asymmetry between
word and color naming. If this is related specifically to reading, or to the relative amount of practice in naming each dimension, as assumed by current theories, then no asymmetry
should arise in shape vs. color naming after equal practice.
In the present study, we trained participants to respond with
nonsense syllables to color patches and to unfamiliar visual
forms (Chinese characters). One group trained more on the
colors and another trained more on the shapes, in precisely
counterbalanced training schedules. According to current
theories of interference, equal amounts of cross-dimension
interference should be expected with incongruent stimuli.

Method
Participants
Twenty eight Greek volunteers (8 male) 19–36 years old
participated in the experiment, assigned randomly into two
groups of 14 (after removing data from a 29th participant
with excessive error rates). Most were graduate students at
the University of Athens. None of them had any knowledge
of or experience with the Chinese language and ideograms.

Materials

¢

Ý

Materials included the simplified Chinese characters for
“red,” (
U+7EA2) “blue,” (
U+84DD) and “green”
(
U+7EFF) presented in red (RGB: 0xFF0000), blue
(0x0000FF), green (0x00FF00), and white (0xFFFFFF) color
on a black background, as well as plain red, green, and blue
rectangular patches of the same colors and dimensions. Characters and patches occupied blocks of 55×55 pixels. For initial practice, we used single recordings of the corresponding
` rewords in standard Mandarin (pinyin: hóng, lán, and lü,
spectively), pronounced clearly by a male native speaker.

Procedure
There were four training steps and two testing steps in the
experimental procedure, spread over two weeks. In Step 1,

participants familiarized themselves with one dimension, by
looking at three stimuli presented simultaneously and permanently on the screen, clicking at will on each to hear the corresponding syllable. They were instructed to memorize the
image-sound associations. Group A was exposed to the three
white characters (“shapes”) and Group B to the three patches
(“colors”), associated with the corresponding syllables. This
step was completed in a few minutes, as soon as each participant was confident to remember the verbal responses.
In Step 2, participants practiced naming the stimuli they
were familiarized with. Each stimulus appeared on the screen
for 1 s, with a 1 s interstimulus interval. Participants were required to name aloud each stimulus as quickly as possible
without making mistakes. They completed 5 blocks per day,
of 60 repetitions each (including an equal number of each
character/color), for 2 consecutive days. Thus, Group A accumulated 600 trials of practice naming white characters and
Group B the same number of trials naming color patches.
In Step 3, on the following day, participants were familiarized with the other dimension, in the same manner as in
Step 1. Group A now saw the 3 color patches while Group B
saw the characters, associated with the same three syllables,
for a few minutes. These first 3 steps all took place at home,
unsupervised, based on detailed written instructions and prepared materials installed on the participants’ computers.
In Step 4, the first interference measurement was made by
the experimenters, denoted below as Time 1 (T1). All participants were tested in color naming first, followed by shape
naming. Prior to the main procedure they were briefly familiarized with a few two-dimensional stimuli, that is, characters
drawn in a color that was associated with the same syllable
(congruent) or a different syllable (incongruent). They were
then administered 144 naming trials, including 36 trials in
each character/color combination condition (resulting in 36
congruent, 72 incongruent, and 36 neutral trials), counterbalanced in color, character, and (for the incongruent condition)
distracting element. The neutral stimuli were color patches
for the color naming test and white characters for the shape
naming test. Trials in all conditions were presented mixed,
in a pseudorandom order (determined individually), within
fully counterbalanced 24-trial blocks, under the control of a
DMDX script (Forster & Forster, 2003). Each stimulus appeared on the screen for 3350 ms, with a 167 ms interstimulus
interval. Responses were recorded into wav files by DMDX.
The entire testing session lasted about 25 minutes.
In Step 5, participants practiced naming the other dimension, using the exact same procedure and materials as in
Step 2, interchanged among groups. So Group A now practiced naming color patches while Group B practiced naming
white characters. They were required to complete 5 blocks of
60 trials per day, for 10 days, thus accumulating 3000 trials
of practice on the previously unpracticed dimension.
Finally, in Step 6 the second interference measurement was
taken, denoted Time 2 (T2), using the exact same procedures
and materials as in Step 4 (T1).

Analysis
Vocal naming responses were processed with CheckVocal
(Protopapas, 2007) to rate accuracy and correct mistriggered
response times. Log-transformed response times (logRT; for
correct responses only) and binomial accuracy data were analyzed using linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models, respectively, fitted with restricted maximum likelihood
estimation using package lme4 (Bates & Sarkar, 2007) in R
(R development core team, 2007). LogRTs were fitted linearly (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008); errors were fitted
with binomial distributions (Dixon, 2008) via a logit transformation (Jaeger, 2008). Effect size estimates (βˆ coefficients)
ˆ to be interpretable as
are reported anti-logged (βˆ 0 = exp(β)),
time ratios and odds ratios, respectively.

Results
Figure 1 plots mean response times and error rates for each
group at each measurement time and condition. There were
16,128 error observations and 15,746 logRT observations
(due to 381 incorrect responses and 1 excluded outlier RT
< 50 ms). An omnibus model was fitted first to each data set.
For example, the logRT model was specified as:
logRT ˜ group * time * task * cond + (1|sID) ,
with 2 levels of group (A and B), measurement time (T1 and
T2), and task (color and shape), and 3 levels of cond(ition)
(congruent, incongruent, and neutral), as well as a random
effect of subjects. Specific effects were tested with restricted
versions of this model on appropriately selected data.

βˆ 0 = 1.060, t = 3.43, p = .0006; error: βˆ 0 = 1.379, z = 0.87,
p = .383). The interaction group/task×time in this dimension
was significant for response time only (logRT: βˆ 0 = 1.097,
t = 4.49, p < .00005; error: βˆ 0 = .163, z = −1.50, p = .135).
To examine whether practice was equally effective in the
two dimensions (tasks) we compared color naming performance to shape naming performance in 3 cases: at T1 after minimal exposure and familiarization only (color for
Group A, shape for Group B), at T1 after 2 days’ practice
(shape for Group A, color for Group B), and at T2 after
10 days’ practice (color for Group A, shape for Group B).
None of the time differences approached statistical significance (p > .5). The error differences were significant only
after 2 days’ practice (βˆ 0 = 14.365, z = 2.33, p = .020).
In sum, neutral shape naming became faster with either
type of extensive practice (shape or color), while color naming became slower after extensive shape naming practice.
There was evidence for shape naming being more accurate
than color naming after two days’ practice. However, the lack
of significant differences in response times between the two
groups/tasks after comparable practice suggests that any differential effects of learning may not be simply indicative of
one naming dimension being easier than the other.

Interference

Learning
We first examined direct learning effects of training, considering the neutral condition only. In the group×time×task models, naming at T2 was faster and more accurate than at T1
(main effect, logRT: βˆ 0 = .856, t = −10.14, p < .00005; error: βˆ 0 = .399, z = −1.97, p = .048), while shape naming
was overall faster and much more accurate than color naming
(main effect, logRT: βˆ 0 = .899, t = −6.99, p < .00005; error:
βˆ 0 = .056, z = −2.72, p = .006). Due to several significant
interactions, more specific tests are reported next.
In the most trained dimension, color naming time improved during the 10 days between T1 and T2 for Group A
(logRT: βˆ 0 = .841, t = −11.73, p < .00005; error: βˆ 0 =
.398, z = −1.95, p = .051), as did shape naming time for
Group B (logRT: βˆ 0 = .870, t = −11.47, p < .00005; error: βˆ 0 = .193, z = −1.34, p = .179). The marginal interaction of group/task×time for these data indicates that Group B
may have improved somewhat less in shape naming time
than Group A in color naming time (βˆ 0 = 1.035, t = 1.79,
p = .073). There was no significant difference in accuracy improvement during this period between the two groups
(βˆ 0 = .495, z = −.54, p = .591). In the previously trained
dimension, Group A also improved in shape naming time between T1 and T2 (logRT: βˆ 0 = .966, t = −2.90, p = .004;
error: βˆ 0 = 8.707, z = 1.86, p = .062), whereas Group B
deteriorated in color naming time during this period (logRT:

Interference was examined as a condition effect, ignoring the
congruent condition and considering only the neutral and incongruent condition. At T1, there was significant interference in accuracy for Group A in color naming (βˆ 0 = .527,
z = −2.24, p = .025) and Group B in shape naming (βˆ 0 =
.250, z = −2.81, p = .005) but not vice versa (p > .2). There
was also significant interference in response time only for
Group B in shape naming (βˆ 0 = .961, t = −3.37, p = .0008)
and no other group/task combination (p > .3). At T2, there
was significant interference in response times in every case,
that is, for Group A in color (βˆ 0 = .931, t = −5.69, p <
.00005) and shape (βˆ 0 = .949, t = −4.72, p < .00005), and
for Group B in color (βˆ 0 = .907, t = −6.46, p < .00005)
and shape (βˆ 0 = .969, t = −2.96, p = .003). There was only
marginal interference in error rates, for Group B in color (βˆ 0 =
.635, z = −1.65, p = .098) and shape (βˆ 0 = .127, z = −1.89,
p = .059); and no error interference for Group A (p > .3).
There was no difference at T2 in either color or shape naming
time interference between the two groups (p > .15), and no
difference between color and shape naming time interference
for Group A (p > .3). There was, however, more time interference in color naming than in shape naming for Group B
(βˆ 0 = 1.070, t = 3.46, p = .0005). There was no difference in
error interference between the two groups.
Change in interference as a result of practice was tested
as an interaction of condition (neutral vs. incongruent) by
time (T2 vs. T1). Response time interference increased for
Group A in both color (βˆ 0 = .936, t = −3.38, p = .0007) and
shape naming (βˆ 0 = .955, t = −2.91, p = .0037), whereas
for Group B it increased only in color (βˆ 0 = .893, t = −5.20,
p < .00005) and remained unchanged in shape (βˆ 0 = 1.008,

t = .50, p = .615). There was no change over time in interference as measured by error rates (p > .2).
Testing the three-way interaction to compare interference
change between the two groups or the two tasks, we found no
difference between the groups in color naming interference
change (logRT: βˆ 0 = .954, t = −1.60, p = .109; error: βˆ 0 =
.784, z = −.36, p = .718) and no difference between color
and shape for Group A (logRT: βˆ 0 = 1.018, t = .71, p = .479;
error: βˆ 0 = 3.445, z = .97, p = .333). There was, however,
a significant difference between groups in shape naming time
interference change (logRT: βˆ 0 = 1.056, t = 2.38, p = .017;
error: βˆ 0 = .127, z = −1.24, p = .213) as well as between
color and shape for Group B (logRT: βˆ 0 = 1.128, t = 4.37,
p < .00005; error: βˆ 0 = .549, z− = .49, p = .624).

If practice effects on interference were symmetrical, we
would expect no three-way interaction between condition
(neutral vs. incongruent), time (T2 vs. T1), and group, either for the dimension practiced during this interval (color for
Group A and shape for Group B) or for the dimension practiced previously (shape for Group A and color for Group B).
Yet this interaction was significant in logRT analyses both for
the practiced (βˆ 0 = 1.077, t = 2.92, p = .004) and the unpracticed dimension (βˆ 0 = .935, t = −2.50, p = .012); there was
no interaction in error rates (both p > .2). Evidently, Group B
showed greater interference increase in the unpracticed dimension and less in the practiced dimension than Group A.
In sum, extensive practice in either color or shape naming
produced increased interference in color naming, whereas in-

2153

terference in shape naming was produced only as a result of
practice in color naming and was less than the corresponding
interference in color naming after comparable practice.

Facilitation
Facilitation was also examined as a condition effect, comparing the congruent and neutral condition (ignoring the incongruent condition). At T1, there was time facilitation only for
Group A in color naming (βˆ 0 = 1.050, t = 3.24, p = .0012)
and no accuracy facilitation in any condition (p > .1). At T2,
there was time facilitation only for Group B in color naming
(βˆ 0 = 1.062, t = 3.82, p = .0001) and at least marginal accuracy facilitation for both Group A (βˆ 0 = 7.085, z = 1.83, p =
.068) and Group B (βˆ 0 = 3.322, z = 2.45, p = .015) in color
naming; there was no shape naming facilitation (p > .15).

Discussion
The results show strong asymmetries in interference between
color and shape “naming,” that is, responding to colors and
to Chinese characters with nonsense syllables. The asymmetries emerged following a paired-associate learning procedure
with the same responses used for stimuli in both dimensions.
The difference is obvious in the top right and bottom left panels of Figure 1, which plot responses to the least practiced
dimension: With equal amounts of cross-dimension training,
color naming interference for Group B grew much greater
than shape naming interference for Group A. Increased color
naming interference for Group B appears largely due to slowing down of responses to color, apparently as a result of shape
naming, much more so for the incongruent stimuli. In contrast, shape naming was hardly affected. In fact, response
times to neutral shapes decreased even after extensive color
naming practice, suggesting that shape naming is overall a
more robust visual-verbal association than color naming.
Our findings cannot be explained simply by shape naming being somehow easier than color naming, because there
were no significant differences in response times or errors in
the neutral condition after comparable amounts of training in
most cases. So, the explanation of the asymmetry cannot rely
on an overall faster or more accurate response to shapes compared to colors. Only interference from shapes to color naming was strong and increasing after training on either shape or
color naming. In some sense, shape naming can be said to
dominate color naming in our experimental paradigm.
Our findings are not necessarily inconsistent with any theoretical mechanism about the interference itself, as all theoretical explanations must somehow account for an asymmetry.
However, our findings present a challenge for theoretical accounts to more specifically address the differential efficiency
of practice in inducing whatever causes the asymmetry in the
corresponding framework. It seems that the asymmetry may
be to some extent specific to aspects of naming rather than
simply due to different amounts of practice. At the same time,
the asymmetry cannot be too specifically tied to reading because it was shown to occur with novel shapes and nonsense
syllables. Expert reading also involves mapping from visual

patterns to phonological forms, but neither the visual nor the
phonological component are arbitrary and isolated. Rather,
visual patterns in reading are composed of familiar (letter)
sequences forming coherent units at multiple grain sizes, and
map to meaningful lexical forms within a language system.
Our findings show that interference asymmetries are caused
outside of reading proper, in the absence of differential experience. We thus narrow down the domain in which to search
for the causes of the asymmetry, and perhaps for the interference itself, pointing to simple visual-verbal associations.
A possible objection might be raised that our design contained an initial asymmetry and was not fully counterbalanced, in that colors were already associated with words, and
the words might have interfered with learning of the novel
color-syllable associations. Although logically conceivable,
this argument seems unlikely for two reasons: First, the exact
opposite, that is, the lack of automaticity in color naming is
typically cited as explanation of the lack of interference from
colors to words in the standard Stroop paradigm throughout
the literature. And second, if learning of the novel associations was hindered by some existing factor, we should have
observed differences in the efficacy of paired-associate training, which was not the case. Moreover, our response set did
not consist of words, and could arguably not compete with
lexical candidates, as it was crafted to be as plain association
and as dissimilar from reading as possible. It should also be
noted that color naming was always tested first at both testing sessions, so as to be free from immediate effects of shape
naming. Therefore, the observed heightened interference in
color naming can only be attributed to the training schedule.
Our findings are not inconsistent with previous demonstrations that training in one dimension affects interference. In
particular, they are fully consistent with the rising interference from shapes to color naming found by MacLeod and
Dunbar (1988), because they only tested the dominant (shape)
dimension taking over, and not the other way around. We predict that in a complementary experiment, namely, learning to
respond to colors with shape names, it should prove much
more difficult to establish a reversal of interference.
How should our findings be interpreted? One possible
route relates to studies arguing against an innate capacity
to categorize and name colors (Zhou et al., 2010), consistent with the lack of universal color terms (Regier & Kay,
2009). In contrast, shapes are inherently nameable in that
visual forms define object categories, and are conceptually
and lexically associated with distinct representational entities (cf. review in Prevor & Diamond, 2005, in the context of
object-color interference). It is obvious that if we paint a banana red we get a red banana and not an elongated apple. This
trite asymmetry may be related to why line drawings work so
well, how reading is at all possible, why orthographic systems
with thousands of ideograms emerged and survived, and what
is a locus of risk and potential failure for children who cannot
become fluent readers despite much effort and support.
As we accept that rats readily develop taste aversion yet

2154

quail are more predisposed to color aversion, that is, there
is species-specific associative bias (Anderson, 2000), it may
be that humans naturally associate visual forms with verbal
labels. Thus reading is made possible by the parasitic development of specialized visual form processors on an evolved
substrate of shape-word associations supporting object recognition, categorization, and lexicalization (naming). Since our
brains could not have evolved for reading, it remains to be
determined what was the pre-existing structure that was so
efficiently hijacked by the invention of written language.
This line of thought is compatible with findings that visualverbal paired associate learning, but not intramodal (visualvisual or verbal-verbal) learning, is strongly correlated with
reading performance, especially in irregular words, even after phonological processing skills are statistically controlled
(Hulme, Goetz, Gooch, Adams, & Snowling, 2007).
Finally, it should be noted that to say that shapes are inherently namable whereas colors are not is not an explanation.
It is merely an observation, prerequisite to explanation. If
it proves robust in further experimentation then a theoretical
explanation will need to describe the nature of visual-verbal
associations, their interaction with other processes to produce
naming, facilitation, and interference, and their contribution
to the development and expression of reading skills.
