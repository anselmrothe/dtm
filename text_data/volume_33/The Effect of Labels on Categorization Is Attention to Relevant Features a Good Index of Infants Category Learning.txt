common features more than a silent control condition.
Rather, they found attentional differences only when objects
were paired with varying labels such that unique labels
directed infants’ attention to unique features more than
infants in a silent control condition. Finally, Robinson and
Sloutsky (2010) found that compared to a silent control
condition, labels often attenuated learning of visual
categories: When images were labeled, infants exhibited
attenuated looking to category relevant features and
attenuated preference for a novel category in a subsequent
testing phase.
      The primary goals of the current study were to examine
how labels influenced visual attention over the course of
category learning and to examine whether infants, like
adults, optimize attention to category relevant features over
time. If labels facilitate category learning, then infants
should be more likely to learn the category in the label
condition. If labels initially interfere with learning, then
infants should be more likely to learn the category in the
silent condition. Furthermore, if labels direct attention to
commonalities, then infants should optimize attention to the
relevant features over time. To investigate the effect of
labels on infants’ attention to category relevant features
during a category learning task, half of the infants were
familiarized to category members with labels and half were
familiarized to category members presented in silence.

To minimize differences between training and test trials,
infants in the label condition heard “Look at these” on all
test trials in addition to hearing “Look at these” once in each
training block. This programming detail made the learning
and test trials identical apart from the change in visual
stimuli. Only infants in the label condition heard auditory
input during the trials. Infants in the silent condition never
heard speech during the experiment. To maintain
engagement, a dynamic bouncing ball was centrally
