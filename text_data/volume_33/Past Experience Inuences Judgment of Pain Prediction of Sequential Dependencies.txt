explored what we will term one-back and two-back models.
One-back models utilized the previous stimulus and response,
S(t − 1) and R(t − 1). Two-back models utilized the previous
two trials, S(t − 1), R(t − 1), S(t − 2), and R(t − 2).
Model Order: First Versus Second. Some models of se-
quential effects suppose that the spillover from trial t − n to
trial t is dependent on the similarity of the stimuli on tri-
als t − n and t (DeCarlo & Cross, 1990 ; Petrov & Ander-
son, 2005). Given that the stimuli in our data were tempera-
ture levels from a continuous scalar dimension, the similarity
can be measured in terms of the squared Euclidean distance,
(S(t) − S(t − n))2 . To allow models to readily utilize this
measure, we included as model regressors the terms S(t)2 ,             Figure 3: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the eight
