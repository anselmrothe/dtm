    This implies an ecological realism, which is above all a
kind of realism about meaning or significance. Meaning, on
this view, is not a projection of information stored in
memory onto stimuli in the brain; instead, animals discover
meaning in the world. Methodological and philosophical
consequences of ecological realism will be discussed.
