cern, then, is “Why Starcraft?” What makes Starcraft more
appropriate an object of study than any other of the many,
many real-time strategy games that share its structure? In the
following section we describe Starcraft and show why it is
not just a game to study in this genre, but unequivocally the
best game to study.
                  Starcraft: Brood War
Game Basics
Starcraft: Brood War is a computer game that involves 2 play-
ers2 , who manage an armed conflict from an angled top-down
perspective. The players use units, similar to Chess pieces,
that have different strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities in
order to defeat opponent units and destroy opponent struc-
tures. Units battle on a two dimensional map, which is com-
pletely obscured from the player until revealed by his or her
units. Additionally, the player’s primary view of the map
only spans a small movable portion of the entire playing field
(see Figure 1 for a sample screenshot from the game). These
design characteristics make Starcraft a game of incomplete
information where efficiently distributing one’s attention is
paramount.
   Starcraft players act simultaneously and continuously to
accomplish their goals. Starcraft is a game of unlimited op-
portunity: there is no explicit limit on the number or fre-
quency of actions players can execute to change the state of
the game. The units themselves can follow commands with
a degree of autonomy. They can navigate obstacles on the
way to a target location supplied by the player, or respond
when attacked. These behaviors are simple and sometimes
unpredictable, so players must manage units constantly in or-
der to ensure desired behavior. This behavior, combined with
a random miss chance on some attacks, makes Starcraft func-             Figure 1: Screenshots from the strategy video game Starcraft:

    6 One could argue that a player taking action over a larger area of
the map controls a larger area and is thus more likely to win because
they are already ahead. While some games of Starcraft are won
by building more bases and a larger economy than one’s opponent,
other common strategies involve strong attacks off of one or two
bases while the opponent is attempting to take more of the map.
Thus we do not think that the SVA finding is solely the result of map
control.
