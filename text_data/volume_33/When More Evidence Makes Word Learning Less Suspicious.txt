Discussion
The goal of Experiment 1 was to examine the effect of
children's prior category knowledge on noun generalization
at multiple hierarchical levels, specifically the “suspicious
coincidence” effect. The vocabulary effect we discovered
was clear: “suspicious coincidence” behavior was highly
inversely correlated with children's vocabulary knowledge,
as measured by our parental survey. Since vocabulary was
not a manipulated variable, the direction of the relationship
is unclear. However, either causal direction is difficult to
explain from a Bayesian perspective. In the Bayesian
account, children with the most detailed knowledge about                 Figure 4: Results of Experiment 1 by prior vocabulary

Experiment 1.
   The procedure was also identical to that of Experiment 1,
except for one modification: instead of a familiarization
phase and then a test phase, the familiarization phase was
expanded and intermixed with test questions. After each of
the first nine test questions, the labeling of exemplar(s) was
repeated. Remember that in Experiment 1, there was a
single round of labeling, followed by all test questions
without any familiarization reminders. In Experiment 2,
labeling was also repeated in between every single test
question. Instead of three object-label pairings per trial as in
Experiment 1, this new procedure resulted in thirty object-
label pairings per trial, or 16.5 object-label pairings heard by
the child prior to each test question on average.
