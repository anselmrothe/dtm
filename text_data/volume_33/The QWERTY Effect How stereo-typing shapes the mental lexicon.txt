Experiment 2 tested whether the QWERTY effect would be
found for nonce words, with no pre-experimental meaning.
This experiment addressed three questions raised by
Experiment 1. First, would an effect of handedness emerge
in a larger sample of participants, including more left-
handers? Second, does the QWERTY effect arise at the
level of the word, or at a sub-lexical level (i.e., letters or
clusters of letters)? Third, could the QWERTY effect be an
artifact of lexical frequency? In principle, if words with
