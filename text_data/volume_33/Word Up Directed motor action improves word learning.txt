Abstract: Can simple motor actions help people expand their vocabulary? Here we show that word learning depends
on where students place their flash cards after studying them. In Experiment 1, participants learned the definitions
of ”alien words” with positive or negative emotional valence. After studying each card, they placed it in one of two
boxes (top or bottom), according to its valence. Participants who were instructed to place positive cards in the top
box, consistent with Good is Up metaphors, scored about 10
