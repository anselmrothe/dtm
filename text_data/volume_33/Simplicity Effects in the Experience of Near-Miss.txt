parameters involved.
   We tested various lottery situations in which an individual
is supposed to have missed the opportunity of winning
1000 €. The near-miss situations we tested are depicted on
figures 2-4. Red areas are winning regions (note that figures
2-e, 3-d and 4-b are not really near-misses). In each case,
the “objective” probability of the outcome is evenly

   Δv is fixed (players were supposed to win 1000 € if the
dot had landed in a red region). The way emotion varies is
not controlled by the ‘objective’ winning probability, at
least in figures 2 and 4 where that probability is kept
constant. It is not entirely controlled by D either, contrary to
Teigen’s claim, as evidenced by the fact that emotion may            (d)                            (e)                (f)
