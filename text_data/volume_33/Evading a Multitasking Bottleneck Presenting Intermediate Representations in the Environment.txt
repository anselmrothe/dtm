Abstract
When people have to store intermediate results for multiple
tasks concurrently, performance decreases considerably as
opposed to when at most one intermediate result has to be
stored. Borst, Taatgen and Van Rijn (2010) have shown that a
multitasking bottleneck associated with intermediate problem
representations can account for this effect. This study
investigates whether representing problem representations
externally reduces the interference. To this end we extended
the experiment in Borst et al. (2010) with a version that
required no problem representation. The results show that
there is an over-additive increase in response times when both
tasks need to store an intermediate representation, as
compared to a situation in which at most one task requires an
intermediate representation, either because no intermediate
representation is needed, or because the intermediate
representation is available on the screen. These results
suggest that multitasking performance can be improved by
presenting intermediate representations in the environment.
Keywords: multitasking; interference; problem state; external
representation; threaded cognition.

Introduction
When you walk through the city on a Saturday afternoon
you come across many examples of multitasking: Business
men who are trying to talk on the phone while driving,
tourists reading a map while walking, and boys watching
girls while riding their bikes. These are examples of the
ability of human beings to do several tasks at once. While
this capability works effortless in certain situations, like
walking and talking, other examples suggest it is nearly
impossible to execute two tasks at once (e.g., writing a
paper and watching television).
Here we discuss
multitasking interference in the problem state resource,
which can be considered part of working memory, and how
to avoid it.
There are several theories that discuss multitasking
interference (e.g., Pashler, 1984; Meyer & Kieras, 1997;
Salvucci & Taatgen, 2008). These theories differ in their
explanation of what causes interference during multitasking:
ranging from one central processing bottleneck (e.g.,
Pashler, 1984) to a purely cognitive control account (e.g.,

Meyer & Kieras, 1997) The theory of threaded cognition
(Salvucci & Taatgen, 2008; Salvucci, Taatgen, & Borst,
2009) takes the middle ground by assuming multiple
processing bottlenecks, both cognitive and perceptual.
According to threaded cognition human multitasking is not
limited by the number of tasks that are carried out, but by
capacity limitations of cognitive and peripheral resources.
As soon as a resource is required by more than one task, this
leads to interference.
Previously Salvucci and Taatgen (2008) discussed two
peripheral bottlenecks (the visual and motor systems) and
two central cognitive bottlenecks (declarative and
procedural memory; cf. “attentional limitations” Pashler &
Johnston, 1998). A third central cognitive resource that can
act as a bottleneck, the problem state resource, was
identified by Borst, Taatgen and Van Rijn (2010). The
problem state is the cognitive resource that holds
intermediate results of processing. While solving an
equation like 3x – 4 = 8, a likely intermediate representation
that is stored in the problem state is 3x = 12.
According to threaded cognition, a resource can only be
used for one task at a time, which means that the problem
state resource can only store a single intermediate
representation. Intermediate representations that are
removed from the problem state resource are automatically
stored in declarative memory. The distinction between the
problem state resource on the one hand, and declarative
memory on the other hand is an important one: Information
that is represented in the problem state resource is directly
accessible, while retrieving facts from declarative memory
costs time.
The idea of a problem state is similar to the focus of
attention in working memory (e.g., Cowan, 1995; Garavan,
1998; Oberauer, 2002) in the sense that it has a size of only
one element and can be accessed without time costs.
Changing from one problem state to another takes a small
amount of time (previously estimated to be around 200 ms,
Anderson, 2007). Moreover, when a previous problem state
has to be retrieved from declarative memory this increases
the time it takes to change the problem state.

referred to as the ‘support condition’, while the original
version will be referred to as the ‘no-support condition’.
In the no-support condition, we expected to find an
interaction between task difficulty, in both response times
and accuracy, similar to the interaction found in the original
study. In the support condition, it is not necessary to
maintain two problem states concurrently; therefore we
expect to find that participants respond faster and more
accurate when both tasks are hard. Therefore, we expect the
interaction effect to decrease or disappear.

Method

Figure 1: A screenshot of the experiment in the support
condition.
Borst et al. (2010) showed that the problem state acts as a
cognitive bottleneck in multitasking using a dual task
experiment in which both tasks varied in whether they
needed a problem state or not. They found an over-additive
interaction effect on reaction times and accuracy when both
tasks needed a problem state.
If interference in the problem state produces such a large
decrease in performance, people will try to find ways to
avoid it. This is consistent with the minimal control
principle, which proposes that internal top-down control
should be minimized to obtain the best performance with the
least cognitive processing (Taatgen, 2007). This means that
whenever possible, control is left to the environment.
Taatgen showed that control is not fully internal, but is
shared by perceptual input and internal top-down control.
We hypothesize that people use their environment to
relieve their problem state whenever possible (e.g., Kirsh,
1995). To test this claim we used a modified version of the
dual task experiment from Borst et al. (2010). In that
experiment, participants had to perform two tasks
concurrently: a subtraction task and a text entry task. Both
tasks had two conditions: an easy version in which no
intermediate results had to be stored, and a hard version in
which participants had to maintain an intermediate result
from one response to the next. We extended this setup with
a version of the task in which the problem state for the
subtraction task is displayed on the screen. Kirsh (1995)
shows that people can pass off internal computation to the
world by correctly timed external representations. In this
version of the task we implemented this idea by presenting
an external representation of the intermediate outcome when
it was needed for further computation. Because the
intermediate outcome was presented on the screen, it was
not necessary to maintain a problem state in the hard version
of the subtraction task. This version of the task will be

The experiment is derived from a dual task that was
previously used to provide support for the problem state
bottleneck hypothesis (Borst et al., 2010). We extended this
original version with a version of the task in which the
intermediate result of the subtraction task is displayed on the
screen. The experiment has a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial withinsubject design (Subtraction Difficulty x Text Entry
Difficulty x support). Eye-movements of the participants
were measured during the experiment, but here we will
focus on the behavioral data.
Participants 33 students of the University of Groningen
participated in the experiment for course credit or monetary
compensation of €10. 4 participants were rejected because
they scored less than 75% correct where the average of the
other participants was >95% correct (as were the results on
the same task in Borst, Taatgen, Stocco et al. 2010 and in
Borst, Taatgen, & Van Rijn, 2010). Two participants were
rejected because they did not adhere to the task instructions,
and 4 because of recording problems of the eye tracker1.
This leaves 24 complete datasets (16 female, age range
18-43, mean age 20.5). All participants had normal or
corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Informed consent as
approved by the Ethical Committee Psychology of the
University of Groningen was obtained before testing.
Design During the experiment, participants had to perform a
subtraction task and a text entry task concurrently. The
subtraction task was shown on the left side of the screen, the
text entry task on the right (see Figure 1). Participants had to
alternate between the two tasks: after entering a digit, the
subtraction interface was disabled, forcing the participant to
subsequently enter a letter. After entering a letter, the text
entry interface was disabled and the subtraction interface
became available again, etc.
The subtraction task is shown on the left side of Figure 1.
Participants had to solve 10-column subtraction problems in
standard right to left order. However, at each point in time,
only a single column was visible. Although the problems
were presented column by column, the participants were
trained to perceive the separate columns in a trial as one 10column subtraction problem (in the practice phase
1
We chose to exclude these participants from the current
analysis to keep the data set the same as in future analyses.
Including or excluding these participants did not qualitatively
influence the reported behavioral effects.

participants started out with a normal 10-column layout,
only later they switched to solving the problems column by
column). Participants had to enter the digits by clicking on
the on-screen keypad with the mouse. In the easy, no
problem state version, the upper digit was always larger or
equal to the lower one; these problems could be solved
without carrying. In contrast, the hard version required
participants to carry six times out of 10 possible columns.
The interface for the text entry task is shown on the right
in Figure 1. Participants had to enter 10-letter strings by
clicking on the on-screen keypad. In the easy version the
input strings were presented one letter at a time and
participants had to click the corresponding button on the
keypad. In the hard version, a 10-letter word was presented
once at the start of a trial. Once a participant clicked on the
first letter, the word disappeared and the remaining letters
had to be entered one at a time, without feedback. Thus,
after the initial presentation of the word in the hard
condition, participants could neither see what word they
were entering, nor what they had already entered.
In the support condition a marker on the screen indicated
whether a carry was in progress in the subtraction task.
Figure 1 shows this condition. The ‘|’ indicates that there is
currently no carry in progress. However, as soon as the
previous subtraction resulted in a carry (e.g., after a column
like 3 – 4), the ‘|’ turned into a ‘1’. These symbols were
chosen so that it was not possible to distinguish the two
characters in peripheral vision.
Stimuli and Apparatus The stimuli for the subtraction
task were generated anew for each participant. The
subtraction problems in the hard version always featured six
carries, and resulted in 10-digit answers. The 10 letter words
for the hard version of the text entry task were handpicked
from a list of high-frequency English words (CELEX
database; Baayen, Piepenbrock, & van Rijn, 1993) to ensure
that similarities between words were kept at a minimum.
These stimuli were also used in the easy text entry task,
except that the letters within the words were scrambled
(under the constraint that a letter never appeared twice in a
row). Thus, participants were presented pseudo-random
sequences of letters that they had to enter one-by-one in the
easy condition. By scrambling the words, we controlled for
letter-based effects, while preventing the use of strategies to
predict the next letter.
The experiment was presented full screen on a 20.1”
monitor.
Procedure Each trial started with the presentation of a
short eye tracker calibration circle, followed by a fixation
cross that was presented for 6 seconds. The fixation marker
was followed by two horizontally aligned colored circles
representing both tasks. The color of the circles indicated
the difficulty conditions of the two tasks in the next trial
(red for hard, green for easy). The circles stayed on the
screen for 1 second, followed by a fixation cross for 600 ms
after which the subtraction and text entry tasks appeared.
Participants had to begin with the subtraction task, and then
alternate between the two tasks. After completing both

tasks, a feedback screen was shown for 2 seconds,
indicating how many letters / digits were entered correctly.
Before the next trial started, a fixation screen was shown for
2 seconds.
The experiment consisted of a practice block and two
experimental blocks. One of the experimental blocks
contained the support condition; the order of the conditions
was counter-balanced over participants. The practice block
consisted of 12 single task trials, followed by a block of 4
multitask trials in which all combinations of subtraction and
text entry were presented (easy-easy, hard-easy, easy-hard,
and hard-hard). Both experimental blocks consisted of 28
multitask trials. Before the second block the subtraction task
was practiced again, to familiarize the participants with the
change caused by adding or removing the carry indicator.
Subtraction and text entry conditions were randomized
within a block. The complete experiment consisted of 56
experimental trials, and lasted for about 90 minutes. In
between blocks participants could take a short break.

Results
Only the data from the experimental phase were analyzed.
Outliers were removed from the data (Response Times <
250 ms or > 10,000 ms), after which we removed data
exceeding two standard deviations from the mean per
condition per participant (in total 2.2% of the data was
removed).
All F- and p-values are obtained from repeated measure
ANOVAs; all error bars depict standard errors. Accuracy
data was transformed using an arcsine transformation before
being submitted to the ANOVA.

Response Times
Response times on the text entry task are defined as the time
between entering the previous number and the current letter.
First responses of each trial were removed. The results for
the text entry task are shown in the upper panels of Figure 2.
In summary: we found an interaction effect between
Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry Difficulty in both the
no-support and the support condition, but in the support
condition this interaction is much smaller.
First, we found a three-way interaction between
Subtraction Difficulty, Text Entry Difficulty and Support
(F(1,23) = 9.29, p = 0.01, ηp2 = 0.29). This indicates that the
interaction between Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry
difficulty differed based on whether support was displayed
on the screen.
The ANOVA results for the different conditions are
summarized in Table 1. There is an interaction effect
between Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry Difficulty
and a main effect of Subtraction Difficulty in the normal
condition. No main effect of Text Entry Difficulty was
found. For the support condition of the task we found an
interaction between Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry
Difficulty and a main effect of Subtraction Difficulty. No
main effect of Text Entry Difficulty was found.

conditions there seems to be an interaction, but in the
support condition this interaction is smaller: We found a
three-way interaction between Subtraction Difficulty, Text
Entry, and Support (F(1,23) = 5.05, p = 0.03, ηp2 = 0.18) on
the subtraction task. Further ANOVA results are
summarized in Table 2.
In the normal condition, an interaction effect between
Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry Difficulty was found.
This interaction replicates the effects reported by Borst,
Taatgen and Van Rijn (2010). There were main effects for
both Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry Difficulty. In the
support condition we found an interaction between
Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry Difficulty, but this
interaction was significantly smaller than the interaction in
the no-support version. This indicates that representing the
problem state on the screen decreases interference in the
problem state.
Both tasks show a decreased interaction in the support
condition, which indicates that displaying an intermediate
representation externally reduces interference in the
problem state resource.

On the subtraction task we found a significant three-way
interaction between Subtraction Difficulty, Text Entry
Difficulty and Support (F(1,23) = 21.41, p < 0.01, ηp2 =
0.48), which shows that there is a difference between the
interaction of Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry
Difficulty with respect to support. Further ANOVA results
are summarized in Table 4. There is an interaction between
Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry Difficulty and there
are main effects of Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry
Difficulty. The upper right panel of Figure 3 shows the
accuracy on the text entry task in the support condition.
The interaction effect that was present in the condition
without support is not present in the condition with support.
This indicates that while adding external support for the
problem state did not influence the accuracy on the text
entry task, the interference that was present in the
subtraction task without support disappeared when the
support was displayed.

Discussion
We have investigated if people use their environment to
evade the interference that arises when two tasks
concurrently need to maintain an intermediate result.
Hereto, we presented an external representation of the
intermediate result of the task on the screen.
The findings presented here show interactions between
Subtraction Difficulty and Text Entry Difficulty in the nosupport condition in both response times and accuracy. This
effect was predicted because a bottleneck occurs when two
tasks concurrently need to maintain a problem state (Borst et
al., 2010). In addition, the support condition demonstrates
that displaying an external representation of the problem
state improves performance on the tasks, not only in the
subtraction task (where the support was implemented) but
also in the text entry task. In line with the ideas of the

1963

minimal control principle (Taatgen, 2007), which showed
that cognitive control is shared between perceptual input
and internal cognition, we have shown that this could be the
case for maintaining intermediate representations.
Although these results indicate that the external
representation does indeed take over part of the role of the
problem state resource and thereby reduces interference, we
expected to find a complete absence of an interaction effect
in both response times and accuracy of the subtraction task.
However, while the interaction effect in the accuracy data
indeed disappeared, the interaction in the response
decreased, but is still present. For the subtraction task this
can be explained by the time it takes to look at the
supporting symbol on the screen: the time it previously took
to recall the problem state from memory is now used to look
at the supporting symbol. However, this does not take into
account that there still is an interaction effect in the text
entry data.
A more plausible explanation is that at least some
participants still store a representation of the subtraction
task in their problem state. During the text entry task this
representation is replaced by the representation of the text
entry task. When returning to the subtraction task, the
problem state does not have to be recalled from declarative
memory and because the support on the screen is always
correct it is more accurate. This explanation can also
account for the interaction in the response times for the text
entry data. Because there still is a problem state for the
subtraction task, this problem state has to be exchanged for
the problem state of the text entry task. Thus, while
participants did not need a problem state to perform the task,
they still seem to create one. Although it seems clear that
participants use their environment to relieve the interference
in the problem state, it seems like they initially still create a
problem state for the subtraction task. The current
experiment does not provide a sufficient explanation for
what happens exactly in the problem state. Future research
could therefore focus on letting participants themselves
construct a representation of the problem state in the
environment. In the current experiment the representation of
the intermediate result is always displayed on the screen,
whether a participant needs it or not. The costs for checking
whether the internal problem state corresponds with the
external problem representation are relatively low. In many
cognitive tasks, such as solving algebra equations with
pencil and paper, shopping with a shopping list and taking
notes while reading a paper, external representations are
created by the person who executes the task (Kirsh, 1995).
Constructing your own representation would probably have
a considerably higher cost, but could be more efficiently
adjusted to fit the individual’s needs. Due to the higher
costs a self-constructed representation would only be used
when necessary, it would therefore give a better
understanding of when it is necessary to have an external
representation as opposed to an internal problem state.

Nevertheless, externally representing intermediate results
of a task can prevent interference in the problem state
resource. Hereby, one of the bottlenecks that keep us from
efficient multitasking can be circumvented.
