objects, hands, and faces, from sensory data in each of three
cameras. These are based on computer vision techniques,
and include three major steps. The combination of using
pre-defined simple visual objects and utilizing start-of-the-
art computer vision techniques resulted in high accuracy in
visual data processing. The technical details can be found in
(Yu, et al., 2009).
Motion data processing Six motion tracking sensors on
participants’ head and hands (3 sensors on each participant)
recorded 6 DOF of their head and hand movements at the
frequency of 240 Hz. Given the raw motion data from each
sensor, the primary interest in the current work was the
overall dynamics of body movements. We grouped the 6
DOF data vector into position {x, y, z} and orientation {h,
p, r}. We then developed a motion detection program that
computes the magnitudes of both position movements and
orientation movements. In addition, we manually annotated          Figure 2. Derived temporal variables from multimodal data. Left:
