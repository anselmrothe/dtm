Abstract: It may be that semantic representations of both literally and metaphorically used words extend to neural
regions related to their modality. Additionally, it is unclear whether underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms in
metaphor and literal sentence processing are distinct, a confusion due to a lack of control over numerous confounding
factors in previous research (Schmidt et al., 2010). We presented a highly controlled set of literal and metaphorical
sentences ending in words from two modalities, auditory (shriek) and motion (crawl) (Cardillo et al., 2010) to 16
participants. The N400 (a gauge of semantic processing) was calculated based on electroencephalographic recordings
at 64 scalp sites. We found an interaction between quadrant of electrode and modality, supporting modulation of
neural semantic mechanisms by modality. No other main effects or interactions were found with this highly controlled
stimulus set, consistent with the notion that metaphors and literal sentences share similar processing mechanisms.
