Using a Speaker’s Eye-Gaze in Conversation: Benefits and Costs

Abstract: Eyegaze is a powerful source of information in face-to-face conversation. Our previous work showed
addressees can use this information rapidly and flexibly, speeding referential disambiguation when the speaker was
clearly looking at a target object versus a similar competitor. However, monitoring eyegaze demands attentional
resources which may also have costs during collaborative tasks. Since the most reliable indication of gaze direction
comes from looking near a speaker’s eyes, but people can also judge less precise head orientation more peripherally
(e.g., Loomis et al., 2008), we compared addressees’ ability to disambiguate instructions to pick up objects when
a speaker’s eyes were visible or were obscured by mirrored sunglasses, compared to a baseline where the speaker
was completely hidden. We present analyses of addressees’ eye movements which reveal the extent to which they
benefit from attending to and coordinating the use of the speaker’s disambiguating eye versus head movements during
language comprehension.
