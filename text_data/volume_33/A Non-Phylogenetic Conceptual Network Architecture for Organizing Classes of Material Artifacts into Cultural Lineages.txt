each taxon has one version or another of the considered
attributes; there are no major modifications in this lineage.
A problem pointed out by Alex Bentley (pers. com.) is that
the units considered are those that are most amenable to
analysis rather than those that were most likely to have been
transmitted from teacher to apprentice. Thus the method
documents readily measurable change, not the actual
cultural ancestry of the artifact.
           Lipo’s Network (LN) Approach
   Network-based methods appear to avert the above
problems by simply ordering data according to similarity
without necessarily implying common ancestry (Lipo,
2005). Analysis of the same data yields quite a different
pattern of evolutionary change. Following O’Brien, samples
that are rated the same with respect to all considered
attributes are categories together as a particular taxon.
Attributes are encoded as a number string. Each position in
the string refers to a particular attribute, and the number at a
position refers to the state of that attribute for the taxon.
This is shown in Figure 2.
   Taxa are simply arranged according to the number of
attributes by which they differ. The majority of taxa have
two lines coming from them, one to a taxon that preceded it,
and one to a taxon that followed it; the network does not
specify which is which. Those that have more (e.g.                        Figure 2. Graph produced by linking taxa to their most
