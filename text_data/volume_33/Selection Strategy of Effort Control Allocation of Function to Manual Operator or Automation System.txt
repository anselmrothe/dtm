study is as follows.
   Research Question 1: Do people perform effort control
based on manual-based selection rather than on system-based
selection?
   Moreover, Lee and Moray (1994) and Madhavan and
Phillips (2010) showed that the human tendency to use au-
tomation systems is influenced by individual differences.
There are many studies investigating the human tendency to
use automation systems from the viewpoints of misuse and
disuse. However, only a few studies have been conducted,
focusing on the relationship between the tendency to use au-
tomation systems and the selection strategy of the effort con-
trol. Therefore, our second interest in this study is to investi-
gate the relationship between the tendency to use automation
systems and the selection strategy of the effort control. In
particular, our second research question is as follows.
   Research Question 2: Do people whose styles of using
an automation system differ, i.e., misuse-biased users and
disuse-biased users, adopt different selection strategies of ef-
fort control?
                                                                               Figure 1: Line (top) and road (bottom) tasks.
