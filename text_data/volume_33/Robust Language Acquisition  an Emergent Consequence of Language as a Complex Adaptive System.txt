RASP parser. For each VAC, we translated the formal
specifications from the Cobuild patterns into queries to
retrieve instances of the pattern from the parsed corpus.
Step 3 Searching construction patterns
Using a combination of part-of-speech, lemma and
dependency constraints we constructed queries for each of
the construction patterns. For example, the V across n
pattern was identified by looking for sentences that have a
verb form within 3 words of an instance of across as a
preposition, where there is an indirect object relation
holding between across and the verb and the verb does
not have any other object or complement relations to
following words in the sentence.
Step 4 A frequency ranked type-token VAC profile
The sentences extracted using this procedure outlined for
each of the 23 construction patterns produced verb type
distributions like the following one for the V across n
VAC pattern:
      come 483
      walk 203
      cut      199     ...
      run      175     veer      4
      ...              slice     4    ...
                       ...            navigate 1
                                      scythe       1                Figure 1 Type-token distribution for V across n
                                      scroll       1
These distributions appear to be Zipfian, exhibiting the
characteristic long-tailed in a plot of rank against
frequency. We generated logarithmic plots and linear
regression to examine the extent of this trend using
logarithmic binning of frequency against log cumulative
frequency. Figure 1 shows such a plot for verb type
frequency of the V across n construction, Figure 2 shows
such the same type of plot for verb type frequency of the
ditransitive V of n construction. Both distributions
produce a good fit of Zipfian type-token frequency with
R2 > 0.97 and slope (!) around 1. Inspection of the
construction verb types, from most frequent down, also
demonstrates that the lead member is prototypical of the
construction and generic in its action semantics.
   Since Zipf’s law applies across language, the Zipfian
nature of these distribitions is potentially trivial. But they
are more interesting if the company of verb forms
occupying a construction is selective, i.e. if the
frequencies of the particular VAC verb members cannot
be predicted from their frequencies in language as a
whole. We measure the degree to which VACs are
selective like this using a chi-square goodness-of-fit test
and the statistic ‘1-tau’ where Kendall’s tau measures the
correlation between the rank verb frequencies in the
construction and in language as a whole. Higher scores on
both of these metrics indicate greater VAC selectivity.             Figure 2 Type-token distribution for V of n
Another useful measure is Shannon entropy for the
                                                               3514
