Abstract: Cratylus famously claimed that there is a kind of inherent correctness in names, the same for all men.
This entails that some codings are better for a given content than others and that coding preferences could be part of
UG (under a modern view: ’analytic biases that prefer certain language types over others’). Since verbs tend to code
events and pronouncing a verb is also an event we call aspectual iconicity the identity of continuity values in both:
English ’to stop’ involves stop consonants and therefore codes termination iconically, German ’aufho&#776;ren’ does
not. We used an artificial language together with purported German translations in order to test the hypothesis that
aspectual iconicity is part of UG and observed a significant effect: Presented with a German sentence describing a
(dis-)continuous event participants preferred a purported translation (to be read aloud) when articulation event and
described event matched in continuity.
