we wish to test the interaction on the 20% trimmed means

constructed a nonparametric permutation-based test. Our
test statistic was the extent to which the cell-20% trimmed
means deviated from the values predicted by a model
consisting solely of main effects (the extent of this variation
is formalized via the standard deviation). The distribution of
this statistic under the null hypothesis is estimated by
constructing 100,000 random permutations of the grouping
variables (i.e., elicitation method and expertise status). The
p-value is estimated as the probability of observing a
deviation from the main effect model predictions as large as             Figure 2: 20% trimmed mean precision and 95% confidence
