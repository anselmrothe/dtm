Visualizing Cross Sections: Training Spatial Thinking Using
Interactive Animations
Cheryl Cohen

Abstract: Three experiments investigated the use of interactive animation and virtual models to train a spatial
visualization skill, the ability to represent the two-dimensional cross section of a three-dimensional object. Trained
participants significantly outperformed controls and showed limited transfer to untrained stimuli. Results were interpreted with respect to three theoretical accounts of improvement after training. Instance-based accounts attribute
performance gains to a larger store of memories and predict no transfer to new stimuli or spatial processes. Processbased accounts attribute gains to increased efficiency of mental processes and predict general transfer to new stimuli
and tasks sharing the same processes. Intuition-based accounts characterize learning as the accumulation of specific
perceptual experiences and predict limited transfer. Performance gains and patterns of transfer were most consistent
with intuition-based theory. The results suggest that interactive animation is an effective medium for training spatial
visualization skills, particularly when supplemented with verbal instruction and physical models.
