Abstract: There is growing evidence that self-directed learning–in which a person chooses what information to
experience–is more successful than passive learning across a range of tasks. One explanation for this advantage is
that self-directed learners focus on information that is useful for reducing their uncertainty. However, the process
by which uncertainty leads to sampling decisions is unclear. While previous work has focused on supporting a single
normative model of sampling, we present evidence that such decisions reflect evolving demands over the course of
learning. As participants learned to differentiate perceptual categories we measured their uncertainty in how to
classify items they sampled, and find distinct shifts in the type of information they choose to collect as learning
progresses. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating models of rational information acquisition (and claims
of confirmation bias) in the context of sequentially extended, self-directed learning tasks.
