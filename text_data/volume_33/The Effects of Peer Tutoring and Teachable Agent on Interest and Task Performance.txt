   KORI
  KORI is a new TA developed to enhance the students’
academic motivation and facilitate learning, and was applied
in this study to students learning about the rock cycle.
Similar to the typical TA, KORI consists of four
independent modules: planning, teaching, testing and
resource. Unlike previous TAs such as Betty, Milo and
Orbo which were developed at AAA lab in Stanford
university, KORI contains a narrative structure and various
learning activities, which were designed to enhance learning
motivation. As the story-like context of KORI (e.g., travel                      Figure 2: Lesson Plan to Teach KORI
story) is presented, the student tutor perceives that the
interaction with KORI is more like a game than boring                Teaching module The teaching module consists of two

   Planning module. The planning module asks the students
to write the teaching plan for three rocks and the rock cycle.
There are four empty boxes to type their own teaching plan
on the three kinds of rock and their transformation cycle.
This module introduces the students to the role of a tutor,
involves them more deeply in the teaching situation, and
increases their responsibility. In this module, the students
can make a teaching plan by themselves, which includes
collecting and sorting the learning materials to teach from
the learning resource, depending on the order of teaching
certain materials, the amount of teaching time, the
frequency of teaching, and the key points. Particularly,
planning activities might improve the learners’                              Figure 3: Rock’s Concept Teaching

 The present study suffered several limitations. The sample
size was small in each condition, and we only examined
self-efficacy among individual differences. Future research
needs to be expanded to cover other grades and domains
such as social studies and science, and also to examine the
effect of KORI on other individual variables such as
metacognition, goal orientation, cognitive ability in order to
continue the development of KORI as an individualized
intelligent TA.
