Abstract
In the context of the cognitive study of diagrammatic representations for deductive reasoning, the availability of syntactic
manipulation of diagrams has played a key role in accounting
for their efficacy. Currently, however, little has been known
about the interface between such syntactic or proof-theoretical
aspects and the corresponding semantic or informational aspects of diagram use. The present paper investigates the cognitive processes of interpreting diagrammatic representations
underlying deductive reasoning, combining the insights from
both logical and cognitive studies of diagrams. A semantical
analysis of two different ways of formalizing logic diagrams
is provided. Based on it, a multiple stage model of cognitive processes of extracting information from logic diagrams
is proposed, and evidence was found to support this model. A
consequence for the way the abstract syntax and semantic of
diagrammatic representations are constrained is also explored.

Introduction
Over the past few decades, many researchers have shown an
interest in logical and cognitive aspects of reasoning with
diagrammatic representations (e.g. Glasgow, Narayanan, &
Chandrasekaran, 1995). In particular, diagrammatic representations used for deductive reasoning, which were traditionally regarded as an auxiliary device to help understanding of quantificational and set-theoretical formalisms in logic
textbook, have been intensively studied using the method of
mathematical logic (e.g. Allwein & Barwise, 1996; Shin,
1994). The formal and mathematical study of diagrammatic
representations have yielded fruitful insights into the cognitive aspects of the use of diagrammatic representations.
As an illustrative example, let us explain with Euler and
Venn diagrams that externally support processes of solving deductive reasoning tasks. What plays a crucial role in
accounting for efficacy of diagrams in problem solving is
the existence of syntactic manipulations of diagrams, whose
structure has been studied in the tradition of the logical study
of diagrams. When logic diagrams are externally given to reasoners, solving processes of deductive reasoning tasks could
be replaced by processes of combining premise diagrams and
extracting the relevant information. Thus a syllogism consisting of two premises, All A are B and No C are B, and a conclusion No C are A has a diagrammatic derivation with Euler
diagrams, as illustrated to the left in Figure 1. Here the unified
diagram De3 is obtained by identifying the circle B in the two
premises and reading off the relation between the circle A and
C, i.e., the disjointness relation, which is automatically determined by the unifying process (cf. Shimojima, 1996). Based

In the tradition of the logical and cognitive study of diagrams, particular emphasis has been on comparison between
diagrammatic and sentential (linguistic) representation systems. In addition to the availability of concrete manipulations, a number of properties which distinguish diagrammatic
from sentential representations have been proposed, seeking
to account for what advantages diagrammatic representations
in general have over sentential ones (e.g. Stenning, 2000;
Shimojima, 2001). By contrast, relatively few attention has
been paid to comparison between different diagrammatic representation systems. However, such a comparison might be
potentially important to provide a more fine-grained analysis
of efficacy of various diagrams in human problem solving.
As a crucial example, consider a solving process of the syllogism we saw above with Venn diagrams. It is shown to the
right in Figure 1. In Venn diagrams, every circle partially
overlaps each other, and then meaningful relations among
circles are expressed by shading under the convention that
shaded regions denote the empty set. Given this semantics,
the process of composing two premise diagrams automatically yields the information corresponding to the correct conclusion, in a similar way to the process in Euler diagrams. Intuitively, however, reasoning with Venn diagrams appears to
be relatively more difficult to handle in reasoning. As emphasized in Gurr, Lee and Stenning (1998), what differentiates
the two cases is the process of interpreting (externally given
or internally constructed) diagrammatic representations. In
particular, a conventional device such as shading involved
might cause complication in interpretation processes of Venn
diagrams. This suggests that in order to obtain a more comprehensive account of diagrammatic reasoning, we need to

2182

take a closer look at cognitive processes underlying information extraction from diagrams.
Traditionally, the notion of “similarity” has played a role
in accounting for differences in efficacy of semantic aspects
of sentential and diagrammatic representations. Generally
speaking, if a certain structural similarity holds between a
representation and what it represents, the representation could
be effective in interpretation and communication even for
users who do not learn conventions governing its use explicitly. In the literature, such a notion of similarity has
been specified in various ways: “homomorphism” (Barwise
& Etchemendy, 1991), “directness” (Gurr, Lee, & Stenning,
1998; Stenning, 2000); “structural similarity” (Gattis, 2004).
However, a precise characterization of the notion of similarity
that could be applied to a varieties of diagrammatic representations remains to be explored. In particular, how a cognitive
account of interpretation processes could be connected to the
formal semantics of diagrams still remains unclear.
The question of information extraction has also been investigated in the study of the cognitive role of relatively simple
use of diagrams, such as charts, maps, and graphs (e.g. Ratwani, Trafton, & Boehm-Davis, 2008; Shimojima & Katagiri,
2010). What plays an important role here is the distinction
between lower-level and higher-level information. For example, a scatter plot contains the lower-level information about
specific data and the overall distribution of the dots delivers
the higher-level information about the structural properties of
data (Kosslyn, 1994). Currently, however, applications of
these findings to an analysis of higher cognitive processes,
such as deduction reasoning, were not fully explored.
The present paper aims to investigate the cognitive processes of interpreting diagrammatic representations underlying deductive reasoning, combining the insights from these
different research traditions. In particular, based on a semantical analysis of diagrams, we argue that a certain structural
correspondence between a diagrammatic representation and
its semantic contents plays a crucial role in both interpretation and inference processes with the representations. Our
approach can also provide a further constraint on the choice
of different ways of formalizing the abstract syntax and semantics of diagrammatic representations, motivating a more
fruitful way of approaching to the logical study of diagrams.
This could contribute to establishing a closer connection between the logical and cognitive approach to human problem
solving with diagrammatic representations.

General Hypothesis
A main goal of the present study is to explore the hypothesis that the “matching” relation between the diagrammatic
representation used in deductive reasoning and the conveyed
information available to users plays an important role in effective diagrammatic reasoning. As a case study, we focus
on the use of logic diagram in syllogistic reasoning. In order to make clear what is the relevant structural relationship
between logic diagrams used and their semantic contents, it

is helpful to first look at what semantic information is carried by syllogistic sentences, using the insight obtained in the
semantics of natural language.
1. The relational analysis of quantified sentence. From
a general viewpoint, syllogistic inferences as investigated in
the psychology literature can be regarded as a special case
of inferences with quantificational sentences in natural language. According to the standard textbook treatment, such
sentences are analyzed using representations in first-order
predicate logic, which essentially involve quantification over
individuals as semantic primitives. In the field of natural language semantics, by contrast, quantifiers in natural language,
such as all, some and no, are analyzed as denoting relations
between sets, i.e., what is called generalized quantifiers (Barwise & Cooper, 1981). Thus, a sentence of the form All A B
is analyzed as A ⊂ B, rather than as the first-order representation ∀x(Ax → Bx). Similarly, No A B can be analyzed as
/ Here the semantic primitives of quanexpressing A ∩ B = 0.
tificational sentences are considered as the relations between
sets, such as subset relation and disjointness relation. Interestingly, the modern reconstructions of Aristotelian categorical syllogisms (Łukasiewicz, 1958 ) and recent development
of the so-called natural logic (van Benthem, 2008) take as
a primitive logical form the relational structure of a quantified sentence, which is schematically represented as Q(A,B).
These logical findings suggest that syllogistic inferences can
be formulated as transitive inferences in a perspicuous way,
without reference to individuals terms.
It should be emphasized that such a “relational” formulation of the meaning of a quantified sentence could capture
not only the truth condition or logical form of a sentence, as
is traditionally assumed, but also how speakers mentally represent such a truth condition or logical form (Hackl, 2008;
Pietroski et al., 2009). The relational approach to quantificational sentences has also been successfully applied to the
psychological study of deduction, resulting in a processing
model based on the assumption that inferences with quantifiers are done in terms of sets rather than individuals (Geurts,
2003). For a discussion on the role of relational knowledge in
general in higher cognition, see Halford, Wilson, & Phillips
(1998, 2010)
In sum, we may plausibly assume that the semantic primitives of quantificational sentences in natural language are relations between sets, and that people’s inferences with quantified constructions are sensitive to such a relational structure.
2. Relational analysis of Euler diagrams. In the logical
study of Euler and Venn diagrams (e.g. Shin, 1994), diagrammatic representations have been given their own formal syntax and semantics, in a similar way as for formulas in mathematical logic. What is remarkable here is that a diagram
may have several “equivalent” formalizations. As an illustrative example, consider a simple Euler diagram E in Figure 2.
This diagram can be naturally interpreted as denoting the subset relation between sets A and B, i.e., A ⊂ B. But it is also

Figure 2: Examples of Euler diagram E and Venn diagram V
that correspond to the sentence All A are B. The diagrams P
is a so-called “plain” diagram, which expresses a tautology.
B denotes the complement of the set B. Correspondingly,
there are two ways of formalizing the abstract syntax of Euler diagrams (Mineshima, Okada & Takemura, 2010; 2011).
According to what is called a “relational” approach, Euler
diagrams are abstractly specified as a set of topological relations holding between objects in the diagrams. For example,
the diagram E in Figure 2 is represented as {A @ B}, where
A @ B means that circle A is inside circle B. Another approach
is a “region-based” approach, which is fairly standard in the
logical study of diagram (e.g. Howse, Stapleton, & Taylor,
2005). Here diagrams are abstractly defined in terms of regions and emptiness. Thus the diagram E in Figure 2 can be
represented by specifying the region (A, B), the region inside
circle A and outside circle B, as a “missing” region.
Clearly, these two ways of defining Euler diagrams predict,
for each diagram, the equivalent truth-condition. The difference consists in the way these truth-conditions are given.
Now the question is: which formulation (or possibly others)
reflects the way the user represents the semantic content of
a given diagram? Here the region-based formulation appears
to be more natural for the meaning of the Venn diagram such
as the diagram V shown in Figure 2. Given the convention
that the shaded region denotes the empty set, A ∩ B = 0/ has
the syntactic reading “the region inside the circle A but outside the circle B denotes the empty set”, or more colloquially, “there is nothing which is A but not B”. It should be
noted here that throughout our discussion, we are assuming
that both Euler and Venn diagrams adopt the convention that
each unshaded region lacks existential imports, i.e., may denote the empty set. Thus the diagram P in Figure 2, where the
circles A and B partially overlap each other, conveys semantically tautologous information. In other words, this diagram
means that the semantic relationship between A and B is indeterminate. In this respect, our semantics differs from the
one discussed in Johnson-Laird, 1983 (for a more detailed
discussion of the semantics of Euler and Venn diagrams, see
Hammer & Shin, 1998 and Sato, Mineshima, & Takemura,
2010a). The two ways of formulating logic diagrams were
then summarized as follows.

for by the relation-based analysis; it triggers a relational representation such as A ⊂ B to the users. By contrast, Venn diagrams are subject to a region-based analysis, triggering the
semantic information such as A ∩ B = 0/ to their users.
We saw above that syllogistic sentences are quantificational sentences of the relational form, schematically represented as Q(A, B), and that such sentences force a reasoner to
form and operate on relational representations in reasoning. If
our basic hypothesis above is correct, Euler diagrams directly
express the topological relationship between circles. Thus it
is hypothesized that when a reasoner is asked to match a syllogistic sentence with a corresponding Euler diagram (or vise
versa), he could appeal to the process of reading off the relational information from an Euler diagram immediately, i.e.,
without any intermediate steps, and then verifying that it is
the same as the information conveyed by the sentence.
In contrast, Venn diagrams have a fixed configuration of
circles and represent set relationships indirectly, by stipulating that shaded regions denote the empty set. Accordingly,
the process of extracting the relevant relational information
from a Venn diagram would be expected to proceed in several steps. As a concrete example, consider how the reasoner
could extract the correct relational representation from the
Venn diagram V in Figure 2 above. Let us call a region inside
of some circles and outside of the rest of the circles (possibly
none) in a diagram a minimal region. Thus the diagrams V
has four minimal regions. Firstly, the reasoner needs to check
each minimal region whether it is shaded or not, as lowerlevel information. In this example, only the region (A, B) is
shaded. Next, the reasoner internally builds the segments that
lumps together the shaded minimal regions continuous with
each other, as well as those which lump together the unshaded
minimal regions. This step makes it possible for the reasoner
to conclude that the diagram delivers the higher-level information “There is nothing which is A but not B”. Then the reasoner would be able to paraphrase it as “All A are B”, which
corresponds to the required information in syllogistic inferences. It is thus hypothesized that such complexities would
cause some difficulties in extracting the required information
from Venn diagrams.

Experiment 1
As an initial test of our hypothesis, we conducted a “sentencediagram” matching test, in which participants were presented
with a syllogistic sentence and asked to choose the diagram
expressing the same information. In Experiment 1, we used a
simple form of Venn diagrams consisting of two circles (see
the diagram V in Figure 2), rather than three. In order to exclude external factors such as familiarity with presented diagrams, participants were provided with sufficient informal explanation of the semantics of diagrammatic representations.

Method

Our basic hypothesis is that an Euler diagram like E in Figure 2 expresses relational information that could be accounted

instructions were given in Japanese. The participants were
divided into two groups: Euler group (13 students) and Venn
groups (14 students).
Materials The syllogistic sentences used in the experiment
are divided into existential and non-existential sentences.
They are of the following patterns:
Non-existential sentences
(1) All A are B.
(2) All B are A.
(3) No A are B.
(4) No B are A.

Existential sentences
(5) Some A are B.
(6) Some B are A.
(7) Some A are not B.
(8) Some B are not A.

The participants were presented with one sentence in a PC
monitor and required to choose the corresponding diagram (if
any). Figure 3 shows templates of tasks for the two groups.

an incorrect answer was found, they were asked to reread the
instruction and to select the correct answer.
(2) The matching task. One task example was displayed in a
PC monitor. A total of eight different types of sentences were
prepared. The participants were asked to press, as quickly
and as accurately as possible, a button with the number representing the answer they reached.
Prediction It is predicted that for non-existential sentences,
the response time to choose Euler diagrams would be shorter
than the response time to choose Venn diagrams. For existential sentences, Euler and Venn diagrams have the same form
(see Figure 3 above), hence it is predicted that there would be
no difference between the two cases.

Results and discussion
Among the twenty-seven students, we excluded four students
(one in the Euler group and three in the Venn group), who did
not answer correctly at all or gave only one correct answer.

Here, in both diagrams, sentence All A are B corresponds to
Answer 1, No A are B and No B are A to Answer 2, Some
A are B and Some B are A to Answer 3, and Some A are
not B to Answer 4. Recall that a diagram in which circles
partially overlap each other does not express any specific semantic relationship between them (see the diagram P in Figure 2). In order to express the existence of objects (i.e., the
non-emptiness of a set), then, we use the point x. As a consequence, in Euler and Venn diagrasm, existential sentences are
represented in the same way as indicated in Figure 3. Note
also that the sentences All B are A and Some B are not A
have no corresponding diagram, hence the correct answer is
5 (“None of them”). Stimuli were presented randomly. After
a task sentence and four diagrams appeared, the participants
were asked to press one of five buttons. There is no time limit
to solve the matching tests.
Procedure The experiment was conducted individually.
(1) Instruction and pretest. Before the test, the participants
were provided with instructions on the meaning of sentences
and diagrams used. A pretest to check whether they understand the instructions correctly was conducted; they were presented with ten diagrams of basic forms and asked to choose
all the sentences (if any) that have the same meaning as given

These data were subjected to a two-way Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA) for a mixed design. There was no significant main
effect for the difference between Euler and Venn diagrams (F
(1, 21) = 2.203. p > .10). There was no main effect for the
difference between existential and non-existential sentences
(F (1, 21) = 0.484. p > .10). There was a significant interaction effect for these two factors (F (1, 21) = 3.575. p < .10).
Multiple comparison tests were conducted by Ryan’s procedure. The results indicated that (i) regarding non-existential
sentences, the response times in the sentence-diagram matching task for Euler diagrams were significantly shorter than
those for Venn diagrams (F (1, 42) = 4.730, p < .05), and
that (ii) regarding existential sentences, there was no significant difference in performance between the Euler group and
the Venn group (F (1, 42) = 0.270, p > .10). We note that the
average accuracy rates for both types of diagrams were very
high (more than 82 %). Furthermore, no significant difference was shown by changing the order of terms in presented
sentences, for example, between No A are B and No B are A.
The overall results provide partial evidence for our hypothesis that the process of extracting relational information from
Euler diagrams to match it with sentence meaning would be
simple and immediate, whereas in the case of Venn diagrams
it could be more complicated.

conducted a “diagram-sentence” matching test, in which participants were presented with a diagrams and asked to select

2, we used Euler and Venn diagrams consisting of three circles as in Figure 1, which is expected to be more sensitive
to the difference in complexity of information-extracting processes for the two types of diagrams.

appeared, the participants were asked to press, as quickly and
as accurately as possible, one of the five buttons with the
number corresponding to the answer they chose. There is no
time limit to solve the tasks.
Procedure The experiment was conducted in the same
manner as Experiment 1. The instructions of sentences and
diagrams were provided, pretests were conducted, and then
the matching task were imposed.
Prediction It is predicted that when diagrams do not contain a point x, the response time for Euler diagrams would
be shorter than that for Venn diagrams. When Venn diagrams
contain a point x, what users need to do is just to recognize the
relationship between the point x and a relevant circle. In such
cases, the relationship between circles is irrelevant, and thus
the processes of identifying each minimal region as shaded
or unshaded and constructing the relevant segments could be
simply omitted. Hence it is expected that the response time
for Venn diagrams that contain a point x would be shorter
than that for those which do not. By contrast, when an Euler
diagram contains a point x, there would be no difference with
respect to whether it contains a point x or not, since in both
cases what the users need to do is to check the relationship
between two objects, i.e., the one between two circles or the
one between a circle and a point.

effect for these two factors, (F (1, 21) = 6.480. p < .05).
Multiple comparison tests were conducted by Ryan’s procedure. The results indicated that (i) regarding diagrams without point x, the response times for Euler diagrams were significantly shorter than those for Venn diagrams (F (1, 42) =
11.919, p < .005), and that (ii) regarding Venn diagrams, the
response times for diagrams that contain a point x were significantly shorter than those which do not (F (1, 21) = 7.885,
p < .05). (iii) regarding Euler diagrams, there was no significant difference in the response between cases that contain a
point x and those which do not (F (1, 21) = 0.627, p > .10).
These results clearly support our predictions. It is noted that
the average accuracy rates for both diagrams were very high
(more than 83 %).

General discussion
The overall results of the two experiments provide evidence for our hypothesis about the multiple stage view on
information-extraction from Euler and Venn diagrams. According to this view, a process of extracting relational information from Euler diagrams consists of a single step, whereas
that from Venn diagrams consists of multiple steps, i.e., identifying shaded and unshaded minimal regions and constructing the segments corresponding to the terms in question.
These results are compatible with the findings in Sato, Mineshima and Takemura (2010b), where the performances in
syllogisms solving tasks with Euler diagrams were compared
with those with Venn diagrams involving three circles, and it
was shown that the former was better than the latter. Sato,
Mineshima and Takemura (2010b) also reported that the performances in syllogism solving with Venn diagrams involving two circles (see Figure 2) were worse than the three-circle
case. They argued that this difference could be ascribed to the
availability of internal syntactic manipulations of diagrams:
in the case of Venn diagrams with two circles, such a syntactic manipulation (i.e. the process of combining two premise
diagrams) would be simply unavailable to untrained users.
However, the difference in performance between Euler and
Venn diagrams with three circles remained to be accounted
for, since both types of diagrams could easily trigger syntactic manipulations because of their uniform forms. The present
paper provides an account of it based on the difference in
information-extraction processes for these diagrams.
Together with these findings, the present study suggests a
possibility of providing a model on the overall processes of
reasoning with diagrams for deduction, where not only the
availability of syntactic manipulations of diagrams but also a
subtle difference in processes of extracting information from
diagrams could make difference in effective diagrammatic
inferences. It should be emphasized here that the present
cognitive study could be fruitful in providing a further constraint or data on theorizing about proof theory (syntax) and
model theory (semantics) for higher-level diagrammatic rep-

resentations. Cognitive or procedural differences in semantically equivalent ways of specifying truth-conditions or logical forms of diagrams (and for that matter, sentences) tend to
be neglected in theorizing about formal semantics and proof
theory for those representations. Even in the study of diagrammatic logic, such theoretical investigations could be conducted independently of any cognitive considerations. The
present study suggests a possibility of a more constrained and
integrated framework to deal with both logical and cognitive
aspects of diagram use.
