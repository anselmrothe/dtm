In GLAM-PS once an MME is created or activated then it
can immediately be used to match productions in the
module it belongs to. However, this MME will not be
available to other modules until it has remained active for a
number of system cycles equal to a global parameter (set to
5 in the model presented in this paper). In essence, there is a                Tactile Input Module                            Manual Output Module

implications of this simple IMC restriction are manifold but
are not the focus of the current paper. However, the
principle impact of this feature is that processes that don’t
require new IMC (automatic behaviour/attention) occur
more rapidly than those that do (controlled behaviour).

Goal Representation in GLAM-PS
In GLAM-PS Modal Memory Elements (MMEs) acting as
goals are not explicitly tagged as goals. Indeed the system
of goal representation in GLAM-PS is implicit rather than
explicit. It is implicit because an MME acting as a goal is
not identifiable in itself as a goal in any way. Its role as a
goal emerges from the way it is used to guide behaviour.
This is done in a similar manner to how explicit goals guide        Figure 1: The structure of GLAM-PS. Perceputal (left) and
