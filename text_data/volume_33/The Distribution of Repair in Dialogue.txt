dialogues from demographic portion of the British National
Corpus (BNC) were used (Burnard, 2000). This consists of
tape recordings of unscripted informal conversations in
contexts ranging from business meetings to domestic
interactions. The recordings are made by volunteers from a
demographically balanced sample of ages, regions and
social classes.
   Thirty dialogues were randomly selected for analysis
from the BNC. These consisted of 1934 utterances, 14,034
words produced by 41 people.
The HCRC Map Task Corpus
The HCRC map task corpus (Anderson et al, 1991) consists
of dialogues between pairs, seated on opposite sides of a
table who each have a copy of a schematic map (their view
                                                                         Figure 1: Repair Distribution in Ordinary Conversations

‘Giver’s, there is a route marked which they attempt to
describe to their partner the ‘Follower’ in enough detail to
allow them to draw it onto their own map. Some landmarks
on the maps are shared and some are not.
   In half of these dialogues eye contact is possible between
the participants; in the other half a screen is placed between
them. In addition familiarity is manipulated so that half the
pairs are familiar and half unfamiliar. An advantage of this
task is that it provides a sensitive measure of task outcome –
the difference or deviation score between the original given
route and the one drawn by the Follower. All 128 dialogue
transcripts from the published HCRC map task corpus were
coded for repair. This corpus consists of 19,133 turns and
156,315 words.
