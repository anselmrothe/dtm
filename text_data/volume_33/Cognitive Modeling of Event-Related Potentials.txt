finding sets of separate functions that can explain all of the
measurements in the most efficient way, as maximally

electrodes were found to react initially together in the ERP,
so this was explained as a single component in the middle of
the occipital area. The FASTICA algorithm was used,

   To simulate the activity, a computer model was
constructed consisting of eight modules corresponding to
the independent components found. Each module, when it
was activated, was assumed to produce one or two dipoles
lasting for its duration. This was modeled as rising linearly
to a peak and then dropping at the same rate. It was assumed
that the dipoles were generated at the location estimated in
DIPFIT and which were consistent with the standard
locations assumed in ACT-R. The brain regions that the
locations corresponded to were found using the Talairach
database (Lancaster and Fox, 2011). Table 1 lists the eight
processes needed to simulate the ERP signals measured in
the selective-attention experiment. Each line shows one
module in the cognitive model with the source region of one
or two electric dipoles. The times listed are the peaks of
activity of each of those modules. Running the simulation
produced output which closely reproduced the scalp
electrical activity measured in the experiment. The third
column shows the coefficient of determination (R-squared)
of the simulation relative to the experimental data for that
time over the spatial area of the scalp.
