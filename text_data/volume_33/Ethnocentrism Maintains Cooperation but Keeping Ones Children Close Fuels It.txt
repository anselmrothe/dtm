constant. Small variations in these parameters preserve
the qualitative nature of the results.
   The important parameter of the simulation is the un-
derlying interaction between agents. Large variations
in the game were considered earlier by Kaznatcheev
(2010b), but we consider only the prisoner’s dilemma and
the natural variable is the ratio between b — the benefit
of receiving, and c — the cost of giving. We kept the
cost of giving constant at c = 0.01 and varied the ben-
efit of receiving through 6 settings for each case study:
0.0015, 0.0020, 0.025, 0.030, 0.035, and 0.040. Thus,
we looked at 6 different b/c ratios with 4 different types
of simulations (standard model, no child-proximity, no
tags, and neither tags nor child-proximity). For each of
the 24 case-parameter combinations, we conducted 30
simulations for 1000 cycles each and considered mean
results. We present results for 3 of the six b/c ratios in
Figure 1. The remaining 3 cases are qualitatively similar
and omitted for brevity.
   Cooperation emerged in only one of the restricted
models, but did not persist there as well as in the stan-
dard model. Figure 1 shows the proportion of cooper-
ative behavior for each condition at each evolutionary
cycle for 3 different values of b/c; each line’s thickness
quantifies the standard error from averaging across 30
simulations.
   The red (without tags) and yellow (with tags) lines
show the two models without random child-placement,
neither of which led to cooperation. On the other hand,
both of the models with local child-placement caused
cooperation to emerge; the green (without tags) and blue
(with tags, standard model) lines show these results. It
is clear that the standard model and the no-tag model
show similar levels of cooperation in the early stages,
and peak at approximately the same maximum level of
cooperation. However, the standard model is able to
maintain the achieved level of cooperation, while in the
no tag model cooperation decays.
   As the environment becomes more benign (higher b/c)
the decay in the no tag model is less pronounced until
for b/c = 4 there is no decay. Figure 1 shows that local
child-placement drives the early emergence of coopera-
tion, whether tags are present or not, while the addition
of tags maintains this cooperation in more competitive
environments, allowing it to dominate in the long term.
