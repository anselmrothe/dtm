Note. The BA represents central episodes of the “Secret in their Eyes” that are relevant for establishing an analogy with the
TAs. The exact wording of the base is arbitrary, since the abstract representations stored in memory may not be specified at a
lexical level. Italized words in the base indicate objects (e.g., wife), object attributes (e.g., original) and relations (e.g., kill)
