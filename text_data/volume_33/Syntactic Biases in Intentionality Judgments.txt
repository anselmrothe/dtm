Materials and Procedure: In Experiment 1a,
participants saw a single sentence from a pair of
logically equivalent sentences like the “exchange”
example above. The other verbs were: “swap”,
“trade”, “loan/borrow”, and “buy/sell”. All verbs
contained “Frank” and “Steven” as the proper nouns
designating the actors in the event.
   Each participant read only one sentence and rated
on a scale of 1-7 how intentionally they thought
either the subject (e.g. “Frank”) or the prepositional
object acted (e.g. “Steven”).
   Experiment 1b employed used the same method

                                                             Participants responded “Yes” or “No.”
