Abstract: Inductive selectivity is well-documented: when people make inductive inferences from categorical
premises, they reason differently about intrinsic versus contextual properties. However, the mechanism yielding
this pattern remains unknown. We examined how people integrate knowledge about given premise categories with
their knowledge about properties when they generate inductive inferences. By varying property and measuring participantsâ€™ beliefs about premise categories, we found that the integration process is markedly different for different
kinds of properties. Specifically, we find that when the property is taxonomically biasing, the tendency to generate
taxonomic inferences is largely independent of the salience of knowledge about premise categories, and is driven
by the property alone. In contrast, when the property is contextually biasing, the tendency to generate contextual
inferences depends on both the property and the salience of knowledge about premise categories. Thus, selectivity
involves differences in how we integrate information as well as what inferences we generate.
