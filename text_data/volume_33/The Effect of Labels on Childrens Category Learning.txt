children learn novel categories with a distinct set of features
common among category members. Specifically, if effects
of linguistic labels on categorization stem from labels
directing children’s attention to category-relevant
information (i.e., through inviting comparison of perceptual
commonalities), then participants who hear labels should
learn the categories faster than participants who do not hear
labels. However, if labels continue to disrupt visual
processing throughout childhood, then participants who hear
labels should be slower to learn the categories than
participants who do not hear labels.

Procedure A female experimenter tested children with a
laptop computer in a quiet room at their preschool or
childcare center. The experiment was presented as a game in
which children had to learn the names of two different
flower categories. Participants were first trained by hearing                                  *
the flower names paired with flower images. The cover

      The flowers they eat have funny names. I’m
      going to show you two different kinds of flowers
      that they like to eat so you can learn the names
      of the flowers. Pay attention to what the flowers
      look like. The two kinds of flowers might look the
      same, but if you look closely, you will see that
      they are different. Now it is time to learn the
      names of the two different kinds of tasty flowers.
