different way to view the results is to consider efficiency
based on total time rather than trials invested (Pavlik &
Anderson, 2008). Time-based efficiency (items learned per
minute of training) is shown in Figure 2. In the immediate
post-test, time-based efficiency for ARTS was 79% greater
than in the Atkinson condition (M=0.964 for ARTS vs.
0.539 for Atkinson; t(30)=4.50, p<0.001). Values for time-
based efficiency for the Atkinson condition were taken only
from the subset of participants who ran on computers that
were not affected by a calculation delay that added space
between trials.
