This distributional approach to meaning takes the view that
words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar
meanings (cf. Wittgenstein, 1953) and that by analysing
word usage we can get at their meanings. For example, the
word co-occurrence statistics derived in Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA) seem to tell us about the structure of the
lexicon, as they are good predictors of reaction times in
lexical decision tasks (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). Simil-                      Figure 1: Venn Diagrams showing (a) rise covering
