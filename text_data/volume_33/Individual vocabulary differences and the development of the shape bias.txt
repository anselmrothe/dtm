The solid/material classification is also noteworthy for the
relatively large standard deviations of each group. For
example, the lowest vocabulary group has an average of .8
words in this classification with a range of 0-6, but the
standard deviation is 1.3 words. There is more within-group
variability in this classification than there is in the number
of mass nouns or names for nonsolids those children know
(M: 1, range: 0-4, SD: .6). Both this variability and the
relatively large number of words that fall into this
classification support further examination of the relationship
between differences in individual children’s’ vocabulary
structure and their novel noun generalization performance.

four-step process predicts that there is nothing special about
the shape side of the vocabulary per se, but rather its
dominance and the overlap between these classifications are
what lead to the emergence of the shape bias. The reason,
then, that a bias to attend to shape seems to become the
default early on is because of this default structure in the
English noun environment. This makes our study one of the
strongest tests of the four-step process, because we are able
to demonstrate that when children have noun environment
(e.g. their individual vocabulary) with a different structure
than the typical one, they show different, and related biases.
