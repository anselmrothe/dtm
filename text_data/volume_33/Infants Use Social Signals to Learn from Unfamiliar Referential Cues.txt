participated in one of two conditions: Social Scaffolding (N
= 16, 5 girls, 11 boys, M = 8 months, 14 days, range: 7;24-
9;12) or Extended Practice (N = 15, 9 girls, 6 boys, M = 8
months, 21 days, range: 7;29-9;21). Two infants were
excluded from the final analyses (one from each condition)
due to fussiness (i.e., completing only 1 out of 8 blocks).
Infants were recruited via local-area advertisements and
given t-shirts for participating.
   Stimuli and Procedure Infants sat in a car seat 50 cm
from a Tobii 1750 eye-tracker with a built-in 17” monitor,
while their caregivers sat behind them. All infants were
calibrated to at least 4 points before the experiment started.
In both conditions, infants were shown up to 8 blocks of
familiarization and test stimuli. The first four blocks
consisted of the Training phase, while the second four
blocks were the Generalization phase. During each phase
infants were familiarized with two audio-visual events.
These events were counterbalanced between participants
with half of the infants seeing the audio-visual animations
during Training that the other half saw during
Generalization. Each block consisted of six familiarization
trials and two test trials. For the Social Scaffolding
condition, the familiarization trials in the first four blocks
showed a central face that looked at the infant and said, “Hi
baby, look at this!” This portion of the clip lasted 4 seconds.
Then, the face froze with a smile while identical animations
appeared in diagonally opposite corners within white
frames. The animations during training were one of two
sets: 1) two cats making bloop sounds and two buses
making whoosh sounds or 2) two ducks making brring                     Figure 1: Schematic of one block of Familiarization and

                              Results
   For each condition (Social Scaffolding and Extended
Practice), we first describe infants’ looking behavior during
the Familiarization trials, followed by the behavior during
the Test trials.
   A 2 (Cued: Cued or Non-Cued location) x 2 (Location:
Object present or No Object) repeated-measures ANOVA 1
was used to examine the effects of cue and audio-visual
information on infants’ looking distribution during
Familiarization. During Test, when infants had to match a
sound to now empty locations, the factors of interest were
Cue (previously Cued or Non-cued location) and Location
(Matched or Unmatched to the sound). A significant Cue x
Location interaction for Familiarization trials was taken as
evidence that infants followed the cue to objects, and a Cue
x Location interaction during Test indicated that infants
associated the test sound to only the previously cued
matched animation. When a Cue x Location interaction was
found, planned t-tests were conducted to confirm that
infants looked longer to cued rather than non-cued object
present or matched locations.
Social Scaffolding condition (Familiarization
trials):
As expected, infants looked predominantly towards the
Cued, Object present locations during the Familiarization
trials in both the Training and Generalization phases (see
Table 1). This was indicated by highly significant Cue x
Location interactions (Training: F(1,15) = 28.43, p < .001,
partial η2=.66; Generalization: F(1,15) = 24.43, p < .001,
