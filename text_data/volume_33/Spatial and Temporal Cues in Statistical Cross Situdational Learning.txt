Abstract: Discovering the link between words and objects is necessary for language learning. Cross-situational
learning is that in order to learn word to referent mappings, learners track statistical possibility across ambiguous
trials between words and objects. Learners may also track additional cues to reference such as consistent spatial
locations and temporal contiguity. We hypothesized that associative learning is best when both cues are available
and poorest when neither cues are available. To examine the effects of these cues, subjects will be given each of
the four possible cue combinations. In conditions with spatial and temporal cues, 4 objects will be presented their
fixed locations and 4 words will be played such that the first word was the last word in the previous trials instead
of random orders. Also,analysis the association between learning data and eye-gaze fixation patterns will give us a
window to continuously measure what takes place with the cues.
