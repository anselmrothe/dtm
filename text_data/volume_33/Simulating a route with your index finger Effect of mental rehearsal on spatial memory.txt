simulated the routes without hand movements; 2) physical
practice in which participants simulated the routes and draw
them on papers; 3) physical practice in which participants
simulated the routes and draw them in air while keeping
their eyes closed; and 4) physical practice in which
participants simulated the routes and draw them in air while
keeping their eyes open. The study adopted a between-
subject design with types of rehearsal methods as the
independent variable and number of direction recalled as the
dependent variable.
   To date, very few studies have been done in investigating
whether mental practice and physical practice enhance
performance in navigation. This research aims to examine
whether participants recall directions more accurately if they
are performing mental and physical practices. Theoretically,
it gains insights into how spatial information is represented
in our memory. Practically, the findings guide us to design
educational programs that specifically help students to
navigate.
