spatial values (see Opfer & Siegler, in press, for review). To
test this idea, we compared the fit of the logarithmic and
linear regression functions for the relation between the mean
estimates of each age group and actual numeric value.
Consistent with the logarithmic-to-linear shift hypothesis,
we found that Kindergartners’ mean estimates were best
described by a logarithmic function (log R2 = .82, lin R2 =
.43), second graders’ about equally by each function (log R2
= .91, lin R2 = .88), and adults by the linear function (log R2
= .66, lin R2 = 1.0). To ensure that these fits did not arise
from averaging over distinct cognitive profiles, we used the
same procedure to find the best-fitting function for each
individual’s estimates. Only 21% of Kindergartners
produced a series of estimates better fit by the linear than
logarithmic function, whereas 46% of second graders and
100% of adults produced a series of estimates better
characterized as linear than logarithmic. Thus, each analysis
