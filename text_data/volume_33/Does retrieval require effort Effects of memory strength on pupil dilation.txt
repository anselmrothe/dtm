   Relative Memory Strength, Pupil Dilation and Effort
   The time to retrieve mentally stored information increases
when the relative strength of this information decreases
(e.g., Sternberg, 1969; Stanners et al., 1969; Jolicœur &
Dell'Acqua, 1998). Although equating longer retrieval times
with increased effort might seem straightforward, Porter,
Troscianko and Gilchrist (2007) have shown effects of
effort on pupil dilation in tasks that were matched for
reaction time.
