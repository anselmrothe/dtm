Abstract
We present findings from an experiment with 6-year-old
children in Norway who are getting started with the process
of learning the numbers from 1 to 10. The findings provide
information on number line estimation - that is, translating a
number to a spatial position on a number line. The results
show different categories of representation of the
magnitudes on the number line, which may represent
different stages in a learning sequence. On this basis, we
show a proposal for a cognitive model of the learning
process towards a linear representation of magnitudes.

Introduction
In this paper we will present our first findings from the
pre-test of a larger experiment where the subjects are
Norwegian 6 year old children just started on pre-school
education learning numbers from 1 to 10. One important
learning process that is involved when dealing with
number magnitude is the estimation of what position a
number value has on a number line.
The learning sequence involved is the one that Siegler
calls the logarithmic-to-linear shift in representations of
numerical magnitude (Siegler, Thompson, & Opfer, 2009).
In order to make a cognitive model of this learning process
we want to investigate what cognitive processes are
involved in learning the positioning of number magnitudes
on a number line.
Siegler et al (2009) show that children undergo parallel
changes from logarithmic to linear representation on
numerosity estimation tasks. The example we have reused
from their article in figure 1 shows long-term changes in
estimation of whole number magnitudes. (A) On 0–100
number lines, kindergartners’ estimates were better fit by
the logarithmic function than by the linear, whereas
second-graders’ estimates were better fit by the linear
function than by the logarithmic; (B) On 0–1000 number
lines, second-graders’ estimates were better fit by the
logarithmic function than by the linear, whereas fourthgraders’ estimates were better fit by the linear function
than by the logarithmic.

From Siegler et al’s research and from others (Dehaene,
Izard, Spelke, & Pica, 2008) we know that a logarithmic
representation is likely to be the starting point of this
learning sequence. This representation is usually attributed
to Weber’s law. However, in some of the Ramani and
Siegler’s work (2008) the initial performance is not
logarithmic, but on average linear but incorrect. Maybe
this has something to do with the scale: 1..10 as opposed to
1..100 compared to the size of the task sheets. But then the
simple Weber explanation will not hold universally.
We also know from the research of Siegler and
colleagues (2009) that this learning sequence happens
several times at different stages during lifetime. That
means children can have multiple representations of
numerical magnitudes. As an example they can have a
logarithmic representation of the numerical magnitudes on
a number line from 0 to 100 while they have a linear
representation on the number line from 0 to 10. As the
children get older and learn a linear representation on the
number line from 0 to 100 too, they may still have a
logarithmic representation on the number line from 0 to
1000, and so on.
A possible account for the transition from logarithmic to
linear is that children learn the location of particular points
on the number line. Schneider et al. (2008) have
investigated the role of anchor points in an eye-movement

207

study. They confirmed in a cross-sectional design with
children from Grades 1 to 3 that the distance from the
nearest orientation point is the most important and highly
significant predictor of the frequency with which a position
on the number line is fixated. Furthermore the results show
that the distribution of fixations on the number line for all
three groups of first grade, second grade and third grade
children are concentrated around beginning, midpoint and
ending of the number-line, see figure 2.

Distribution of fixations

first grade; middle: second grade; right: third grade). From

This shows that a great deal of attention is directed to
those three positions on the number line and that those
positions are of importance when a subject is doing a
number line estimation task. As Schneider himself notes,
the results then replicate Petitto's (1990) findings with
respect to the use of the midpoint strategy and a countingup strategy by students in Grades 1–3.
By an anchor point on a number line we mean a location
that the positions of other number values are related to. If
zero is an anchor point we can say: I know where zero is,
and I know that two is a bit to the right of zero’s position,
and then the same for all of the actual distribution of
number values. That means there is a mapping going on
between a number value and a position on the number line
that is related to an anchor point. The work of Schneider et
al (2007) suggests at least three such anchor points: the
endpoints and the midpoint. They also show that from
grade 1 to3 children tend to increasingly focus on the
correct positions on the number line while solving the
estimation tasks.
A possible model of progressing towards a linear time
scale can therefore be one that increasingly learns the
locations of particular points on the number line, and uses
those as anchors to determine the points that it does not
know. It therefore needs some sort of representation of the
positions of anchor points, but also a method of
determining points in between those anchors.
As a theory of how anchor points are stored in memory,
we use the ACT-R declarative memory (Anderson, 2007).
In order to determine positions between the anchor points,
we use the optional mechanism of blending (Lebiere,
Gonzalez, & Martin, 2007). This mechanism can generate
weighted averages over examples in memory based on
their activation and the distance from the requested item.

Lebiere and colleagues (2007) used blending in an
instance-based model of decision-making for repeated
binary choice. An example of blending that is more similar
to numeric magnitudes is one of time perception by
Taatgen & van Rijn, (Submitted).
To investigate the usefulness of this idea, we looked for
evidence of anchoring in collected data of our own.

The number line estimation task
The experiment, from which we will use the findings from
the pretest in this paper, is a sort of replication of a study
first made by Siegler and Ramani (2008) among preschool
children from low income families. In Norway the
population of children at kindergarten and preschool are
mixed. Thus we have defined the population for the
experiment by learning level. In Norway children start at
school the year they are 6 years old. This first year in
school they start to learn the numbers from 1 to 10. We
assume that this represents a mental level that should make
most of them just capable of dealing with the empty
number line.

The Method of the pre-test
Participants
Participants were 39 children in their first year at school,
so called preschool, with no experience with number lines.
All of them are born in 2004 and recruited from the same
municipality, Gjesdal. 17 of them are recruited from Solås
School, 7 from Dirdal School and 15 from Bærland
School. The population at these schools is mixed, but at
Bærland with a larger representation of children with two
languages, Norwegian not being their mother tongue.
Materials
Stimuli for the number line estimation task were two stacks
of 10 sheets of paper, each with a 25 cm long line arranged
horizontally across the page, with ‘0’ just below the left
end of the line, and ‘10’ just below the right end. A
number from 1 to 10 inclusive was printed approximately 3
cm above the center of the line, with each number printed
on one of the 10 sheets in each stack. The order of the
sheets in the stack is randomized.
Procedure
The test is conducted as a teacher to student task:
- The teacher or student pulls a sheet from the stack.
- The teacher says: “Here's the number [number that is on
the pulled sheet]. And here you see a line that starts with 0
and ends at 10. Where on this line is the correct position
for the number you see. Put a mark with your pencil”.
- The student makes a mark where he thinks the number
should be positioned.
In this way the task is carried out with all the sheets in
the first stack. Then the task is continued in the same way
with the second stack. In this way the numbers from 1 to
10 inclusive were presented twice in random order, with all
numbers presented once before any number was presented

208

twice. No feedback was given, only general praise and
encouragement.
Result and discussion
Figure 3 shows the mapping between numbers and
positions on the number line that we found in the
experiment. Performance is on average reasonably good.
What is surprising is that the extent in which the curve
differs from linear is not towards a logarithmic curve, but
in the opposite direction. Points are plotted with error bars.

The Results

The mirrored L is represented by subjects that seem to
position mostly by counting up and know something about
one or two numbers close to zero and ten. They are
classified in this category if 1 through 8 are all far below
the midline, and 10 above. The plotting of the mean values
gives something like a vertical mirrored L, see figure 5.
The next group, from whom the plotting of mean values
of the task result give us a vertical mirrored Z image, has
positioned more of the numbers close to ten on the correct
side of the middle of the number line and are classified in
this group if at least 8-10 are far above five and 1-6 far
below:

To get a better sense of the difference of responses, we
categorized individuals into four categories. From this
categorization, three of the participants were excluded
because they produced more or less random results.
We found that there were roughly four groups that
resemble a horizontal mirrored L, a mirrored Z, an S and a
linear line. Even though the borders between these
categories are fuzzy, they seem to represent a sequence in
learning the number line from 0 to 10. The categories are
classified as follows:

Figure 6: Mean of results from category Z-shape
The third group is even more close to a linear
representation and the plotting of the mean values of this
group gives us an image more like an italic S. The subjects
in this group are classified to this category if 5 or 6 are put
around the midpoint, and 1-4 are below, and 7-10 are
above the line. The new learning step for this group is that
they have obviously recognized one or two number
magnitudes close to five to belong to the middle of the
empty number line:

result from this group looks linear and gives us an image
close to a linear graph:

This perceived distance can then be used as the mismatch
in the activation equation. Weber’s constant becomes a
scaling parameter.
We think that a subject that is involved in the learning
sequence we are investigating, knows some anchor points
and has a strategy for relating the remaining number values
to those points.
The activation of an anchor point is equal to its base
level activation that is based on the number of experiences
with that anchor in the past minus the distance (according
to the Weber formula) between it and the number you are
trying to retrieve. By first using the equation for base level
learning of ACT-R the model uses the softmax equation to
determine Pi, the probability of retrieving each qualifying
chunk.

In this equation t is a constant for the retrieval noise level
and is set to its default level of 0.25. For the blending
retrieval our model uses the value of Pj to calculate the
result value that is retrieved by the formula of Taatgen and
van Rijn (2010):

A computational cognitive model
The results from the eye-tracking experiment of Schneider
and colleagues, mentioned above, makes us believe that
cognitive functions dealing with number line estimation
connects to one or more anchor points. Thus, a general
idea of this model is that it stores a set of anchor points of
which it knows the location of on the line. These anchors
are stored as chunks in declarative memory, more
specifically as a pair of number and position. When the
model wants to put a point on the line, it attempts a
retrieval of that number and its position.



$% &%  ' # (#
#

Vj is the position of the anchor point on the number line.
So, the resulting position for the number on the number
line is a weighted average of the locations of anchors
(weighed according to their retrieval probability).In our
model the case is not time intervals measured by number
of pulses, but positions (where is the number on the
number line), that are stored in a memory pool.

The functions of the model
How the model works
In order to allow the model to mark positions of numbers
for which it does not have a memory representation, we
will use the blending mechanism that we mentioned
earlier. Blending uses existing (anchor) chunks in
declarative
memory
to
construct
intermediate
representations. Two factors are important in this
construction process: the mismatch between the anchor
point in memory and the number we look for, and the
memory strength of the anchor point.
An appropriate function to define the mismatch between
two numbers is Weber's law. Weber's law is typically used
to express a "just noticeable difference" between two
stimuli. We use it to calculate the magnitude of the
perceived distance between values like this:
   

  2  12, 1

The model is a very simple model, a general memory
theory. And it is not the complete story. Counting will be
implemented at a later stage. Now it has an activation
baseline function and there are three functions dealing with
the declarative memory.
One function makes a reference list of numbers involved
and their position on the number line. A chunk is
represented as a list, with a number (what number is it
about) and a position (where is it on the number line), and
a references list with moments in time the chunk has been
accessed.
The mismatch function is based on Weber’s law and the
result value is zero, a negative value or a positive value
depending on whether the first number is similar, less than
or greater than the second number. The mismatch assumes
two numbers are more similar if they are closer and higher
and is used to calculate the activation of a chunk.

By using the four functions mentioned above, the model
simulates one of each of the four cases involved in our
empirical data. We have the L-shape case, where we
assume that we know one better than ten. Then chunk
containing number and position for the anchor point 1 is
given one more activation entry. In the second case, the Zcase, we assume that we know 10 a bit better. In the third
case, the S-case, we assume that we now also know five.
And in the fifth case, the linear case, we know pretty well
where most or all numbers belongs on the number line.
The number of entries we add to the chunk can also be
used to manipulate the simulation of the model. The
following table shows the number of activation entries
used for the anchor points:

The blending retrieval

The next case tries to simulate the mirrored L-shape
category. In this case the anchor point 1 is given one more
activation entry. The image we get from the curve of this
case is not so clearly L-shaped, figure 10. The reason for
this we assume is because there is a great bit of counting
involved in children’s estimation at this level. Our model
does not do counting as we rely solely on Weber’s law and
blending.

Position on number line

A blending function is performing the retrieval and adds
noise. Because of that we do not use the regular ACT-R
retrieval rule and noise activation function.

Results from running the model and discussion
The model gives five images of simulated values where
four are related and rather similar images of estimated
values to images from mean values of our four groups of
empirical data, when plotted.
The initial stage, is a case that gives a logarithmic curve
and has the smallest activation of only one entry on each of
1 and 10 as anchor points, see figure 9.

In the next case we try to simulate the category when the
results give a curve like a mirrored Z-shape. Now we know
one and ten a bit better, and the activation in declarative
memory is set to five entries for the anchor point 1 and
three entries for anchor point 10. As figure 11 compared to
the curve image in figure 6 shows, the model now fit a lot
better.

In the case where we get an S-shaped curve the model
knows the anchor point 5 too, but with smallest activation,
and 1 and 10 is strengthened with one entry each. We now
clearly see that the image of the curve is more and more

211

similar to the relevant curve image from the result of our
experiment data. The reason for that we assume is relaying
on the subjects decreasing use of counting as they learn
more anchor points and therefore corresponds better to our
model as we already has mentioned do not use counting
but
only
blending,
see
figure
12.

Conclusion
The model produces a rather good fit to our data from
real life. If counting-up and counting-down were added to
the model’s simulation we assume that it would give an
even better fit to our data. To adapt it to estimation tasks
with number lines of longer length then 0 to 10, there is a
need of implementing scaling to simulate the physical size
of the number line.

We have added 3 and 8 as new anchor points in declarative

The anchor point 5 is strengthened by three more entries

an anchor point, it is for all of them much smaller than a
tenth of 25 cm, that was the length of the number line used
in the estimation task. That shows that for the counting
strategy the subjects do not have a clear clue of what the
size of a unit should be.
But on the opposite, with a larger scale, for example up
to 100, the children’s unit will be too large and counting
often will produce a logarithmic curve like Siegler and
others has found.

children showed, we obtain no logarithmic curve from
running our model. If we investigate the physical size of
