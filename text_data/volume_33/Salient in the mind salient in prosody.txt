                          Introduction
A central problem in recent research on speech production
relates to the question to what extent speakers take into
account what their listeners know or do not know. Quite a                       Figure 1: Experimental setup of Wardlow Lane et al.

contrast was boosted by ironic processes. It remains to be
seen whether ironic processes are strong enough to affect
both the formulation and articulation of an utterance, which
is expected if one assumes that speakers indeed leak
information.
   To shed light on the issues mentioned above, the current
study investigates how factors of salience, such as the
communicative setting, the type of contrast and the
contrastive feature affect both the lexical use and prosodic
realisation of adjectives. A production task elicits speakers’
utterances which are analysed in terms of frequency of
occurrence, and acoustically and perceptually to explore
prominence patterns.                                                       Figure 2: Example stimuli per contrast (top: single,

              Adjective frequency analysis
Method
Adjective use is calculated separately for size and color as a
proportion so that 1 means that all participants uttered an
adjective in all four instances of a stimulus. A distinction is
made between adjectives that match and mismatch the
contrastive feature in the stimulus. That is, whenever
speakers use a size adjective when the contrastive feature is
size (or a color adjective when the feature is color)
adjectives are called matching. Whenever speakers use a
size adjective when the contrastive feature is color (or vice
versa) adjectives are called mismatching. Utterances
including both adjectives count once for size and once for
color (one matching and one mismatching). Four analyses of
Variance (ANOVAs) are performed with repeated mean
proportion measures of adjective use as dependent variables
(i.e. size and color, matching and mismatching) and with
communicative setting (3 levels: shared, privileged,
conceal) and contrast (2 levels: single, double) as within
subject factors.

In sum, the present results reveal that communicative
setting, contrast and feature contribute additively to the
likelihood that an adjective is uttered to refer to that
contrast. The different variables only affect the use of
contrast-matching adjectives. A fair amount of contrast-
mismatching adjectives confirms that speakers have a
tendency to use adjectives as overspecification (Pechmann,
1989). The next section will explore how the salience
factors influence the prosodic realisation of adjectives.
                      Acoustic analysis
Acoustic analysis concerns pitch, which is believed to be the
most important correlate of accent (Collier & ‘t Hart, 1981)
and duration, which correlates strongly with redundancy
(Lieberman, 1963; Aylett & Turk, 2004). Utterances consist
of contrast-matching adjectives taken from the shared and
the conceal setting, as only those adjectives'occurrence is
affected by the factors communicative setting and contrast.

Utterances used for acoustic analysis (n = 225) are
presented to listeners in a prominence rating task. A total of
13 participants (10 men, 3 women, Mage = 29.8 years, age
range: 24-44) completed the task. All of them were native
speakers of Dutch without hearing problems who
participated voluntarily.
Method
Participants were asked to rate the prominence of the
adjective and the noun on a seven point scale. The task was
web-based and designed using WWStim (Veenker, 2003).
