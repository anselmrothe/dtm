both tasks, participants are describing how to manipulate

relocate them in space. Thus, in both conditions, speakers
could theoretically represent the location of the word or the
object in gesture. However, in addition to relying more on

Materials and Procedure
The procedure and stimuli were identical to those used for
the description task in Experiment 1, except that participants
did not perform the memory task simultaneously.
Participants were told that the purpose of the experiment
was to investigate how people remember and communicate
information. Like in Experiment 1, participants were told
that someone would later listen to their descriptions and
have to recreate the object or sentence.
   A video camera recorded the participants’ descriptions.
All participants learned of the presence of the hidden                  Figure 3. Average gesture rates in the spatial and verbal
