Abstract: Contemporary debates concerning the attentional blink (AB) question whether resource depletion causes
this robust attentional deficit. To investigate this uncertainty, we employed rapid serial visual presentation paradigms
that presented stimuli at 30-120msec/item. In addition to the two targets of interest, a third target was positioned
immediately before the second target on ’three-target’ trials. ’Two-target’ trials, which were less resource intensive
that the three-target trials, were also included. Interestingly, target accuracy was significantly improved on the threetarget trials compared with the two-target trials. Consequently, resource depletion cannot explain the AB because
the deficit was alleviated when target detection resources were strained. However, we employed novel conditional
accuracy analyses to show that, on three-target trials, the second target was better detected when the additional
third target was not detected. Therefore, although resource depletion cannot explain the AB deficit on a global level,
resources play an important role on the local level.
