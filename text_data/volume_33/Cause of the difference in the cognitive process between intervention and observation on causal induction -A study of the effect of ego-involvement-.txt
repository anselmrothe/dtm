Abstract: Pearl (2000) insisted on the importance of intervention in correlated events for causal induction. In
addition, Sloman and Lagnado (2005) demonstrated that people infer differently, depending on whether they observed
the events or intervened in them. I suppose that this result can be explained by the difference in the degree of egoinvolvement. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of ego-involvement on causal judgment and the
manner in which ego-involvement affects causal induction. In Experiment 1, the causal relationship was judged
marginally more strongly when ego-involvement was present. Further, in Experiment 2, this effect was shown in a
situation where causality is quite unclear or a situation where there is a fairly certain causal relationship between
cause and effect. I conclude that ego-involvement affects causal induction in a situation where there is trouble because
of causality.
