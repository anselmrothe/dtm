   In general, there is no restriction on how the members of
a category should be divided in clusters. Thus, the VAM
encompasses all the representations that can be constructed
from a category, including the exemplar representation as
the least abstract and the prototype representation as the
most abstract representation. If, for example, a category
consists of four members, 15 different category
representations can be created (see Figure 1).
   The fact that the VAM considers all the representations
that can be constructed from a category raises a problem
when a category contains a large number of exemplars. In
this case, the number of possible category representations
within the VAM becomes quite large and this will severely
complicate model fitting. A more constrained version of the
VAM therefore favors representations that are based on the
clustering of similar stimuli (Vanpaemel, 2011) while an
even more constrained version considers only one
representation at each level of abstraction (Verbeemen,
Vanpaemel, Pattyn, Storms & Verguts, 2007). This latter
version of VAM uses a K-means clustering procedure
(Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman, 2001) in order to reduce
the number of possible representations per category. The K-
means clustering procedure selects the most plausible           Figure 1: The 15 possible representations for a category

                         Discussion
   Generally, different computational models of category
learning are compared on their ability to account for the
choice proportion in a category learning task. Though useful
to discriminate among competing models, choice
proportions provide only a limited window on
categorization behavior. Also other variables like typicality
and classification response times are informative about the
underlying category representations and processes. Several
researchers attempted to extend categorization models to be
able to predict classification response times in category
learning tasks. (Ashby, Boynton & Lee, 1994; Lamberts,
2000; Nosofsky & Palmeri, 1997; Nosofsky & Stanton,
2005).
   In this paper we extended the VAM, designed to predict
choice proportions, to enable it to account for response
times by combining the set of category representations
provided by the VAM with the process assumption of the
EBRW model. Based on response time data from Nosofsky
and Palmeri (1997), we showed that the best-fitting
representations of two of the three participants relied on
some amount of partial abstraction. This finding adds to the
growing body of evidence that categorization should not
always be exemplar based, but can rely on intermediate
representations as well (e.g., Griffiths et. al. 2007,
Vanpaemel & Storms, 2008).
   Although response times are not the primary variable of
interest in categorization research, we believe that they can
provide additional information about the nature of category
representations and should be used more often in the
evaluation of computational models of category learning.
One problem, for example, with evaluating models using
choice proportions is that it becomes difficult to study
participants that have received extensive training. In long
learning tasks, like the one used by Nosofsky and Palmeri
(1997), participants will often reach expertise and have, by
the end of training, classification proportions that are close
to ceiling for the training examples. A clear advantage of
working with response times is that, even after extensive
training, they show variation that is likely to be linked to the
categorization processes and representations. Therefore,
response times can offer insights in the category
representation of the expert engaging in the task.
   Being able to investigate abstraction after extensive
learning is of particular theoretical importance, since one
key factor that is thought to influence abstraction seems to
be the time point in learning (Smith and Minda, 1998).
Further, when models of category learning are applied
outside a lab context to semantic concepts, such as fruits or
vehicles, relying on choice proportions is very difficult,
since most people are experts for these categories. Models
such as VABRW escape this conundrum, because they can              Figure 3: The best category representations for the three

the promise to provide fruitful insights in the representation
of semantic concepts.
