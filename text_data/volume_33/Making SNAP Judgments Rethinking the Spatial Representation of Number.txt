The stimuli consisted of the Arabic numerals 1 through 9,
excluding the number 5, presented visually in the middle of
the screen. Each digit was presented 10 times in each block.
   Trials began with a fixation cross in the center of a
computer monitor, presented for 1000ms. Then the number
stimulus was presented in the center of the computer
monitor for a maximum of 3000 ms. Participants had to
judge where the number was greater or less than 5, and
respond by either vocalizing (Experiment 1) or pressing a
button (Experiment 2). Participants were told to respond as
quickly and accurately as possible.
   Since we were interested in whether number and pitch
would interact spontaneously, the Pitch Response
experiment was always completed before the Spatial
Response experiment.
Pitch-Response Task: Participants were asked to produce
either “high-pitched” or “low-pitched” un-sustained “ahs”

numbers greater than 5 or less than 5, depending on the
mapping. The ordering of blocks and mappings were
counterbalanced. Before the beginning of each block,                     Figure 1: Median RTs in the pitch-response task.The
