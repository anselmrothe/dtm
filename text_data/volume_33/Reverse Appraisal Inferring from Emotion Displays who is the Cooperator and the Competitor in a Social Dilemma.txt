from information conveyed through the other party’s facial
displays of emotion.
The view that facial displays of emotion can be used to
detect cooperators is in line with the idea that emotions
serve important social functions and convey information
about one’s feelings and intentions (Frijda & Mesquita,
1994). One theory, compatible with this social view of
emotions, is based on appraisal theories of emotion. In
appraisal theories (Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003), displays of
emotion arise from cognitive appraisal of events with
respect to an agent’s goals, desires and beliefs (e.g., is this
event congruent with my goals? Who is responsible for this
event?). According to the pattern of appraisals that occurs,
different emotions are experienced and displayed. Now,
since displays reflect the agent’s intentions through the
appraisal process, it is also plausible to ask whether people
can infer from emotion displays the agent’s goals by
reversing the appraisal mechanism. Hareli and Hess (2009)
provide preliminary evidence for this theory. In their study
they show that people can, from expressed emotion, make
inferences about the character of the person displaying
emotion (e.g., a person who reacted with anger to blame was
perceived as more self-confident than one that reacted with
sadness). We refer to this theory as reverse appraisal.
In previous work, we suggested that reverse appraisal is
useful in understanding how people make inferences, from
facial displays of emotion, about the other party’s
propensity to cooperate (de Melo, Carnevale & Gratch,
2010). In that study, we ask people to play the iterated
prisoner’s dilemma with two computer players, or agents,
that, even though following the same strategy to choose
their actions, display different emotions according to the
outcome of each round. Computer agents that show emotion
had already been argued to be a useful research tool for
basic human-human interaction research (Blascovich et al.,
2001). One agent – the cooperative agent – had displays that
were consistent with the goal of maximizing joint reward
(e.g., expression of joy when both players cooperated). The
other agent – the individualistic agent – had displays that
reflected how good the outcome was for the self,
independently of the value for the participant (e.g.,
expression of joy when agent defected and participant
cooperated). The results show that people cooperate more
with the cooperative agent. Moreover, the results show that

Abstract
This paper explores whether and how facial displays of
emotion can impact emergence of cooperation in a social
dilemma. Three experiments are described where participants
play the iterated prisoner’s dilemma with (computer) players
that display emotion. Experiment 1 compares a cooperative
player, whose displays reflect a goal of mutual cooperation,
with a control player that shows no emotion. Experiment 2
compares a competitive player, whose displays reflect a goal
of getting more points than the participant, and the control
player. Experiment 3 compares the cooperative and
competitive players. Results show that people: cooperate
more with the cooperative than the control player
(Experiment 1); do not cooperate differently with the
competitive and control players (Experiment 2); and,
cooperate more with the cooperative than the competitive
player, when they play the latter first (Experiment 3). In line
with a social functions view of emotion, we argue people
infer, from emotion displays, the other player’s propensity to
cooperate by reversing the emotion appraisal process. Postgame surveys show that people interpret the emotion displays
according to appraisal variables (desirability, responsibility
and controllability) in ways that are consistent with
predictions from appraisal theories of emotion.

Introduction
People frequently face social dilemmas where they must
choose between pursuing their own self interest and collect
a short-term reward or rely on another person for mutual
cooperation and maximize joint long-term reward (Kollock,
1998). In these cases, it is valuable, from an adaptive point
of view, to be able to detect how likely the other is to
cooperate (Frank, 1988). Nonverbal displays have been
argued to be an important cue in this detection process
(Boone & Buck, 2003). In particular, there has been a lot of
empirical research on the impact of facial displays of
emotion on emergence of cooperation: studies show that
cooperative individuals display higher levels of positive
emotion than non-cooperators (Scharlemann et al., 2001);
and Schug et al. (2010) argue that cooperators can be
identified by high emotional expressivity of both positive
and negative emotion. In this paper, we go further and try to
understand how people make inferences in social dilemmas

tat is a strategy where a player begins by cooperating and then
proceeds to repeat the action the other player did in the previous
round. Tit-for-tat has been argued to strike the right balance of
punishment and reward with respect to the opponent’s previous
actions (Kollock, 1998). So, the action policy used in our
experiment is as follows: (a) in rounds 1 to 5, the agent plays the
following fixed sequence: cooperation, cooperation, defection,
cooperation, cooperation; (b) in rounds 6 to 25, the agent plays
pure tit-for-tat. The rationale for the sequence in the first five
rounds is to make it harder for participants to learn the agents’
strategy and to allow participants to experience a variety of facial
displays from the start.

the effect is particularly salient when participants play first
with the individualistic agent (de Melo, Carnevale &
Gratch, submitted). This contrast effect is in line with the
well-known black-hat/white-hat (or bad-cop/good-cop)
effect (Hilty & Carnevale, 1993) that argues people
cooperate more with a cooperative opponent if they’re first
matched with a tough opponent. This effect suggests that
initial firmness may lessen the temptation to exploit and that
cooperative initiatives that are extended in the context of
firmness are likely to evoke reciprocity.
In this paper, we further explore the role of reverse
appraisal and the black-hat/white-hat contrast effect on
emergence of cooperation in a social dilemma when playing
with agents that display emotions. The paper presents three
new experiments: in Experiment 1, people play the iterated
prisoner’s dilemma with a cooperative agent (which
displays reflect a goal of maximizing joint reward) and a
control agent (which displays no emotion); in Experiment 2,
people play with a competitive agent (which displays reflect
a goal of earning more points in relation to the participant)
and the control agent; in Experiment 3, people play with the
cooperative and competitive agents. This set of experiments
extends our previous work in the following ways: (a) it
explores the competitive orientation, which is the third and
last of the common social value orientation we see in people
(McClintock & Liebrand, 1988); (b) it introduces
comparisons with a control agent that displays no emotion;
(c) in a post-game questionnaire, we explicitly probe the
mediating role of appraisal variables on the effect of
emotion displays on emergence of cooperation.

Experiment 1: Cooperative vs. Control
Design
Figure 1: Software used in the experiment.

The experiment follows a repeated-measures design where
participants play 25 rounds of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma with
two different computational agents for a chance to win real money:
the cooperative agent; and the control agent. The cooperative agent
displays emotions through the face, whereas the control agent
displays no emotion. The strategy for choosing which action to
take in each round is the same for both agents.

Conditions. There are two conditions in this experiment: the
cooperative agent; and the control agent. Both agents follow the
same action policy but differ in their facial display policies. The
facial display policy defines the emotion which is conveyed for
each possible outcome of a round. Table 2 shows the facial
displays for the cooperative agent. The control agent shows no
emotion. The facial displays are chosen to reflect the agents’ goals
in a way that is consistent with appraisal models of emotion
(Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003). Thus, the cooperative agent’s
displays reflect the goal of mutual cooperation: when both players
cooperate, it expresses gratitude (with a display of joy), as the
outcome is appraised to be positive for the self and the participant
is appraised to have contributed for it; when the agent cooperates
but the participant defects, it expresses anger, as the event is
appraised as negative and the participant is blamed for it;
otherwise, the agent shows no emotion. Condition order is
randomized across participants.

Game. Participants play the iterated prisoner’s dilemma but,
following the approach by Kiesler, Waters and Sproull (1996), the
game is recast as an investment game. Essentially, participants can
invest in one of two projects – Project Green (or cooperation) and
Project Blue (or defection) – and the outcome is contingent on
what the other party invests in. Table 1 summarizes the payoffs.
The participant is told that there is no communication between the
players before choosing an action. Moreover, the participant is told
that the other party makes its decision without knowledge of what
the participant’s choice in that round is. After the round is over, the
action each chose is made available to both players and the
outcome of the round, i.e., the number of points each player got, is
also shown. The experiment is fully implemented in software and a
snapshot is shown in Fig.1: During game play, the real-time
animation of the agent is shown on the left.

Facial displays are animated using a real-time pseudo-muscular
model for the face that also simulates wrinkles (de Melo, &
Gratch, 2009). Facial displays were all previously validated (de
Melo, Carnevale & Gratch, 2010). The displays are shown at the
end of the round, after both players have chosen their actions and
the outcome is shown. Moreover, there is a 4.5 seconds waiting
period before the participant is allowed to choose the action for the
next round. This period allows the participant to appreciate the
display before moving to the next round. To enhance naturalness,
blinking is simulated as well as subtle random motion of the neck
and back. Two different bodies are used: Ethan and William. These
bodies are shown in Fig.2 as well as their respective facial
displays. Bodies are assigned to each condition randomly and
agents are referred to by these names throughout the experiment.

goal in the game, participants were instructed to earn as many
points as possible, as the total amount of points would increase
their chance of winning a lottery for $100.

Results
Participants that did not experience joy with the cooperative
agent1 where excluded from analysis (though keeping them
would lead to the same pattern of results). So, 10 (out of 48)
participants were excluded.
To understand how people cooperated with the agents, we
look at cooperation rate over all rounds. Figure 3 and Table
2 show the results for this variable. Significance levels are
calculated using the repeated-measures t test.

Figure 2: The agent bodies and their facial displays.
Measures. During game-play, we save information regarding
whether the participant cooperated in each round. This is our main
behavioral measure. After playing with both agents, we present a
questionnaire that probes how participants are appraising the
situations where emotion displays are shown. In this regard, three
appraisal variables are relevant (Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003;
Ortony, Clore & Collins, 1988): desirability, which reflects how
congruent with the agent’s goals the event is; blameworthiness,
which reflects who is responsible for the event (the self or the other
party); and, control, which reflects how capable is the agent of
coping with the consequences of the event. Appraisal theories
usually predict that: joy occurs when the event is desirable and the
agent has control over it; anger occurs when the event is not
desirable and another agent is responsible for it. So, in the postgame questionnaire, for each agent, we ask a set of questions
regarding the cases where the cooperative agent expresses emotion
(i.e., when mutual cooperation occurs or the participant exploits
the agent). Therefore, the same questions are asked four times (2
agents x 2 cases). For each case, we show a picture of the emotion
the agent displayed and ask the following questions (scale goes
from 1 – ‘not at all’ to 7 – ‘very much’), where the agent is
actually referred to by its body’s name:
 How desirable was the outcome of the round to the agent?
 How much do you think the agent feels you were responsible?
 How much do you think the agent feels he can control the
outcome of future rounds?
 How likely was the agent to play GREEN in the next round?

definition of a competitive orientation (McClintock & Liebrand,
1988): when the agent exploits the participant, it expresses joy;
when the agent is exploited by the participant, it expresses anger;
otherwise, it shows no emotion. The post-game questionnaire asks
the same questions as before only with respect to the two cases
where the competitive agent expresses emotion. For this
Experiment, 38 participants were recruited from the USC Marshall
School of Business. Average age was 22.3 years and 63.3% were
males. Most participants were undergraduate (46.7%) or graduate
(53.3%) students majoring in diverse fields. Most were also
originally from Asia (66.7%) and North America (33.3%).

Discussion
The results show that people cooperate significantly more
with the cooperative agent than the control agent (Table 3).
This is in line with the view that, in social dilemmas, people
look for cues in their trading partners that they might be
willing to cooperate before engaging in cooperation
themselves (Frank, 1988; Boone & Buck, 2003). The results
also show that this effect is being driven by the condition
order in which participants play with the control agent first,
and the cooperative agent second. In a previous study (de
Melo, Carnevale & Gratch, submitted) we got a similar
contrast effect when people played with an individualistic
agent first, followed by a cooperative agent. We advanced
an explanation based on the black-hat/white-hat effect (Hilty
& Carnevale, 1993) that argues people cooperate more with
a cooperative opponent if they’re first matched with a tough
opponent. Applying the black-hat/white-hat effect to this
case means that the cooperative agent is perceived as the
white-hat (or cooperator) and the control agent as the blackhat (or non-cooperator). Whereas the former was expected,
the latter requires further explanation. The control agent is
perceived as a black-hat likely as a consequence of its lack
of reactivity to the game. Absence of emotion displays can
also emphasize the perception that the opponent is tough.
Finally, human-computer interaction studies show that
people prefer to interact with agents that display emotions
than agents that do not (Beale & Creed, 2009).
But how do people identify who is the black-hat and the
white-hat? We argue people infer from emotion displays
what the agents’ goals are by a process of reverse appraisal.
The results from the post-game questionnaire provide
insight (Table 5): in line with appraisal theories (Ellsworth
& Scherer, 2003), people perceive the cooperative agent to
desire more and have more control when it expresses joy
(i.e., when mutual cooperation occurs) than when it
expresses anger (i.e., when the participant exploits the
agent). It is no surprise, then, that people perceive the agent
to be more likely to cooperate again after joy, than after
anger (last row in Table 5). Overall, this suggests people can
infer from emotion displays, through appraisal variables,
what the agents’ goals are. However, it is interesting to note
that people also tend to perceive the control agent to desire
more the mutual cooperation case than the case where the
participant exploits the agent. This suggests people make
appropriate inferences regarding desirability even in the
absence of emotion. Nevertheless, whereas the pairwise
comparisons for the cooperative agent are significant for
desirability and control, they are not for the control agent,
which emphasizes the importance of the emotion displays.

Discussion
The results show that people are not cooperating differently
with the competitive or control agents. This likely means
both agents are perceived to be equally unlikely to
cooperate. The results are also in line with what would be
expected when playing the black-hat/black-hat sequence
(Hilty & Carnevale, 1993). However, agents are likely being
perceived as black-hats for different reasons. Whereas for
the competitive agent this perception follows from its
competitive displays, for the control agent it follows from
its lack of reactivity (see the ‘Discussion’ for Experiment 1).
The results for the post-game questions (Table 7) are also in
line with expectations from appraisal theories (Ellsworth &
Scherer, 2003). People perceive the competitive agent to
desire more and have more control in the outcome it

outcome it expresses anger (participant exploits agent).
Moreover, people perceive the competitive agent to assign
responsibility significantly more to the participant when it
expresses anger, than when it expresses joy. Notice this
difference is not significant for the control agent. Finally,
notice again that magnitude differences for appraisal
variables are higher for the emotional agent than the control
agent, thus, emphasizing the relevance of emotion displays.

General Discussion
The studies presented here confirm that people are
influenced by facial displays of emotion when deciding
whether to cooperate in a social dilemma. Experiment 1
reveals that people cooperate more with a player that shows
cooperative displays than one that shows no emotion.
Experiment 2 shows people do not cooperate differently
with a player that shows competitive displays and one that
shows no emotion. Experiment 3 shows that people
cooperate more with a player that shows cooperative
displays than one that shows competitive displays, when
they play the latter first. Overall, the results emphasize the
importance of context for interpreting what emotion displays
means. Effectively, the cooperative and competitive players
only differ in the context under which they express joy and,
yet, people play differently with each. Hareli and Hess
(2009) had also noticed the relevance of context for
perception of smiling. The results, thus, question the view
that the cooperator is simply the one that shows the most
positive emotion (Scharlemann et al., 2001); or, seeing that
the cooperative and competitive agents express just as much
emotion, the view that cooperators are simply the ones that
express more emotion, be it positive or negative (Schug et
al., 2010). We argue that, in line with the social functions
view of emotion (Frijda & Mesquita, 1994), people are
making inferences from emotion displays regarding the
other party’s propensity to cooperate. Moreover, we propose
reverse appraisal is the key to understanding how people
make those inferences. Our findings from the post-game
questionnaires suggest that people are, effectively, capable
of interpreting the agents’ emotion displays according to
appraisal variables (desirability, responsibility and
controllability) in ways that are congruent with the
expectations from appraisal theories of emotion. In the
future we plan on gathering further support for the reverse
appraisal proposal, as well as understand its limitations,
with new experiments that explore the mediating role of
appraisal variables through statistical methods, as in Hareli
and Hess (2009), or experimentally manipulate appraisal
variables and measure the impact on cooperation rates.
