extends our previous work in the following ways: (a) it

Finally, human-computer interaction studies show that
people prefer to interact with agents that display emotions
than agents that do not (Beale & Creed, 2009).
   But how do people identify who is the black-hat and the
white-hat? We argue people infer from emotion displays
what the agents’ goals are by a process of reverse appraisal.
The results from the post-game questionnaire provide
insight (Table 5): in line with appraisal theories (Ellsworth
& Scherer, 2003), people perceive the cooperative agent to
desire more and have more control when it expresses joy                           Figure 4: Cooperation rates in Experiment 2.
