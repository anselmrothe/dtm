Temporal Associations

Abstract: Neuroanatomists have identified an asymmetry in intercortical connections, with feedforward projections
from the sensory periphery tending toward more focused and dense connection patterns in comparison to feedback
projections, which tend to be more dispersed. Using a simple computational cognitive neuroscience model of approximately hierarchical processing in sensory cortices, we show how such asymmetric bidirectional connectivity supports
the implicit learning of associations over time, with correlated stimuli separated by short delay periods. According to
this model, the dynamics of recurrent connectivity in sensory hierarchies supports the persistence of representations
of recently experienced stimuli, allowing those representations to become associated with stimuli consistently arriving
after a short delay. These learned associations are embodied in feedback connections, with synaptic strengths modified by simple correlative (Hebbian) neural learning mechanisms. Furthermore, the presence of asymmetric forward
and backward projections throughout the sensory hierarchy is shown to support implicit learning at multiple levels
of featural abstraction.
