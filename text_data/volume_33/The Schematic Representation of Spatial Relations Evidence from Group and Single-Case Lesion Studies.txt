Picture-schema matching This task was designed to assess
patients' abilities to abstract spatial concepts from different
photographic representations and match them to simplified
representations consisting of lines and geometric figures.
Patients were presented with a probe photographic image
situated adjacent to four schematic target images. (Fig. 1A)
Among the four targets to choose from, one correctly
depicted the spatial relationship in the probe image, one
depicted a within-class relation, and two depicted across-
class relations. Foils were distributed as such in all four
tasks. For each task, subjects indicated which one of four
pictures or schemas depicted the correct answer either by
pointing or by reading the letter underneath a particular
image.
Word-schema matching This task was designed to test
patients' abilities to extract the appropriate spatial meaning
from locative prepositions and match them to simplified
schematic representations. Word probes were presented
adjacent to four target schemas as in the picture-schema
matching task (Figure 1B).
Word-picture matching This task was designed to test

Residual VLSM analyses
Residual analyses are shown in Figures 2c and 2d. By
design, for VLSM methods, greater behavioral variability
within groups is desirable to identify specific brain behavior
correlations. This greater behavioral variability within each
group maximizes the likelihood of finding statistically
robust differences within the group and minimizes the
likelihood of finding differences across groups.
