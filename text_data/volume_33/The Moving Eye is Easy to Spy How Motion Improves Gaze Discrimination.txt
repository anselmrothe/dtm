Abstract: When people move their eyes, their change in eye direction carries a motion signal. However, most
research using gaze direction as a stimulus either controls or excludes the motion of the eyes. Here, we directly
examined the role of motion in the discrimination of eye movements. Participants were shown two images: a person
looking straight ahead and then looking to the left or right at 1, 2 or 3 degrees visual angle from fixation. This
resulted in the apparent motion of the eyes to the left or right. In the no motion condition, participants received
the two images separated by a 200 ms blank display, eliminating the perception of motion. Participants were more
accurate and more confident of their judgements in the condition that included eye motion, but were also highly
accurate without motion. These data indicate that eye motion can contribute to the computation of anotherâ€™s gaze
direction.
