   The second goal is to produce a general model of eye
movements on texts which could easily adapt to high-level
changes. For instance, a user may be looking for some
information, first engaging in a skimming task, then
switching to a learning process for a while, then moving to a
scanning process because a specific word that occurred
previously has to be reread in context. Our claim is that
these processes are along a continuum. It is therefore
interesting to model this behavior in a continuous way.
   In order to build the model, we first gathered
experimental data on different ways of processing a text.
