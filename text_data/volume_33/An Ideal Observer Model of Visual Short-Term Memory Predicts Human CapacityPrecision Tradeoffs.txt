would correspond to the continuous resource model (Bays &

resources (in this case bits) among visual features in a scene.
By contrast, the discrete slot model (Cowan & Rouder, 2009)
instead assumes that VSTM consists of a set of encoding slots
(typically assumed to be 4), each of which has some fixed
encoding precision. This could also be implemented in our
model by focusing 𝑅/4 bits on a subset of 4 items in the scene.
   More generally, our ideal observer model of VSTM can en-
compass both of these competing theories. If a scene contains
𝑛 items, we define a distribution over the probability of en-
coding 0 through 𝑛 items in VSTM. This distribution allows          Figure 2: Illustration of the task stimuli. (a) Subjects are
