   Whilst Milton and Wills (2004) believed that their spatial
separability effect was due to a deliberative overall
similarity strategy being more likely for spatially separable
than for spatially integrated stimuli this explanation was
inevitably post-hoc and there is currently no other evidence
that directly supports this claim. The aim of the present
study was to seek evidence for this proposal. To do this, we

Milton and Wills (2004) proposed, the spatial separability
effect was due to the application of an effortful, deliberative
overall similarity strategy, then one would predict that it
would be possible to attenuate or even eliminate the effect if
participants had limited time in which to categorize the
stimuli. This is because participants would then have
insufficient time in which to apply the deliberative strategy
that is assumed to underlie the separability effect. The
present experiment investigates this hypothesis.
