   Developing a mechanistic account of how words associ-
ated with multiple interpretations (e.g., <river>/<money>
BANK) are recognized is central to understanding the repre-
sentations and processing mechanisms underlying word com-
prehension. Recently, there has been a major upheaval in
the ambiguity literature, as researchers have discovered that
long held ambiguity effects are not associated with all am-
biguous words universally. Rather, these effects appear to
be critically modulated by the relatedness amongst the in-
terpretations of the ambiguous word. Further complicating
matters, there have been reports that the effects of related-
ness are also not consistent across tasks. For instance, rel-
ative to unambiguous controls, polysemes with highly re-               Figure 1:       Reproduction of simulation results reported by
