Abstract: People gesture during spatial tasks (Alibali et al., 2001; Kita & Özyürek, 2003; Morsella & Krauss,
2004), and how they gesture reveals information about ongoing cognitive processes (Alibali & Kita, 2008; Church &
Goldin-Meadow, 1986; Schwartz & Black, 1996). One task that requires many spatial processes is reading geologic
maps. Geologic maps give information about the spatial relationships of geological structures at the surface that
in turn can inform an expert about the underlying 3D structures. However, they are complex, contain both spatial
and domain specific symbolic information, and are hard for students to understand. The current study compares
how expert geologists and students use gesture in explaining these maps. We report gestures used to convey spatial
information about the penetrative relations and those used to convey information about the sequences of events.
Hand shape, orientation, placement, and movement of the gesture convey information that is not available is speech.
