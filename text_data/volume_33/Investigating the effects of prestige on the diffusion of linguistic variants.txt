Abstract
Language, arguably the cognitive capacity that distinguishes
humans, is a dynamic complex adaptive system whose
structure and evolution is influenced by a host of factors. This
paper takes a population dynamics approach to investigate the
diffusion of linguistic variants in populations, focusing on the
effect of differential prestige of linguistic variants and of
speakers. A novel method that combines computer simulation
with mathematical modeling is applied to the specific aim of
identifying factors that formally constitute selective pressures
on variant diffusion. Of the factors studied, only the intrinsic
prestige of variants is found to pose selective pressure, while
speakers’ prestige merely modulates variant spread.
Keywords: Language evolution, Price equation, Pólya urns,
population dynamics.

Introduction
Language, arguably the cognitive capacity that defines
humans, is a dynamic complex adaptive system (Beckner et
al. 2009) whose structure and evolution is influenced by a
host of factors. We apply the principles of population
genetics (Fisher, 1930; Wright, 1984) to language, and
focus on one aspect of language evolution, i.e., the changes
in the proportions of linguistic variants in a linguistic
community. Such changes are usually achieved via diffusion
of various (phonetic, lexical, syntactic, etc.) variants. At the
population level, linguistic diffusion (henceforth simply
“diffusion”) can be viewed as the shift in the proportions of
linguistic variants used by a population over time
(Nakamura et al., 2007). Some well-documented examples
of diffusion include the Great Vowel Shift in English
occurring from the 14th to 16th century (e.g., Wolfe, 1972),
other sound changes in modern languages (e.g. Shen, 1997;
Labov, 2001), and lexical borrowing among languages (e.g.,
Bloomfield, 1933; Cheng, 1987).
Examining the mechanisms for diffusion can shed light
on questions concerning the cognitive capacities for
language and the effects of linguistic or socio-cultural
constraints on language evolution (Wolfe, 1972; Pinker &
Bloom, 1990; Croft, 2000; Hauser et al., 2002; Tomasello,
2008). Empirical studies from historical linguistics and
sociolinguistics have revealed that linguistic, individual
learning and socio-cultural factors could all affect diffusion

(e.g., Labov, 1994, 2001; Shore, 1995; Fisiak, 1995; Croft,
2000), and recently, mathematical analysis and computer
simulation have been used to quantitatively analyze the
effects of these factors on diffusion. By quantifying the
contact patterns and constraints within or across
populations, mathematical analysis helps to predict the
influence of these factors (e.g., Nowak et al., 2002; Abram
& Strogatz, 2003; Wang et al., 2004; Dall’asta et al., 2006;
Kalampokis et al., 2007; Minett & Wang, 2008); by
simulating individual behaviors during linguistic
interactions, computer modeling helps to trace how
interactions among individuals spur the origin of a common
set of form-meaning mappings (e.g., Steels, 1995; Ke et al.,
2002), how processing constraints lead to linguistic
regularities (e.g., Kirby, 2002; Gong et al., 2009), and how
social connections affect diffusion within and across
communities (e.g., Nettle, 1999; Ke et al., 2008).
Diffusion can be driven by chance factors; then the
process is called drift and follows the neutral model of
evolution (Kimura, 1968). It can also be driven by selection,
in which case, a feature of the linguistic variants (e.g. ease
of pronunciation, cognitive salience, social prestige)
increases its fitness, i.e., makes it more likely to be used and
learned, and therefore diffused among speakers, than
alternative variants.
The present study focuses on three factors, namely variant
prestige, model bias and transmission error, and seeks to
establish whether each of them poses selective pressure on
the evolution of linguistic variants. How these factors relate
to linguistic behavior is illustrated next: First, linguistic
variants possess feature values which may affect the
probability with which the variants carrying them are
adopted and used, in other words, they affect the variant’s
prestige. A physical feature, such as the ease in perception,
for instance, could confer high prestige to a certain variant
(Labov, 1994), meaning that it will be more likely to be
produced than other variants. Cheng (1987) describes
lexical variants borrowed from other languages as highprestige when they are more salient to hearers than the
existing variants for the same meaning. Second, in human
society, ordinary people preferentially copy from
individuals (models) of higher social, political, or economic
status (Labov, 1963; Johnstone, 2010); this is called

1491

individual bias or model bias, and has been used to explain
the spread of certain cultural variants (Boyd & Richerson,
1985; Henrich and McElreath 2003; McElreath and Henrich
2007). Third, transmission error happens simply when
speakers make production or perception errors. We do not
expect transmission error to constitute a selection pressure,
due to its random nature (as implemented in our model).
In this paper we apply the Price equation (Price, 1970,
1972) to quantitatively identify the selective pressures on
diffusion, i.e., the factors that successfully lead to the spread
of certain type of variants in a population. Though originally
proposed in biological terms, this equation can also be
applied to any group entity that undergoes socio-cultural
transmission (Gardner, 2008; Jäger, 2008). We also employ
multi-agent computer model simulations following the
Pólya urn dynamics (Johnson & Kotz, 1977; Marshall &
Olkin, 1993). This model simulates production, perception,
and update of variants in linguistic interactions. The results
of the simulations are analyzed with the Price equation in
order to determine whether the factors studied constitute
selective pressures on the cultural diffusion of linguistic
variants.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: first, we
describe the computer model and the Price equation; second,
we analyze the effects of variant prestige, transmission error
and model bias on diffusion; and third we conclude the
paper and point out some promising future work deriving
from this study.

Methods
The Computer Simulations
The Pólya urn model was first designed to study contagion.
In its original implementation, it consists of an urn
containing a number of red and green balls; at each
timestep, a ball is randomly drawn from the urn, and then
returned to it together with a number of balls of the same
colour. Such drawing and returning processes repeat
themselves, causing the distribution of variant types in the
urn to change over time. In our model, an urn is initiated
with V tokens, each belonging to a particular type (v1, v2, …
vV) and having a quantifiable feature xi (all feature values
form F). At a time step, a token vi is drawn randomly from
the urn and returned with another token of the same type.
Our computer model, inspired on the prototypical Pólya
urn model, contains N agents (individuals), each denoted by
an urn. Variant types and tokens represent linguistic types
and tokens. During an interaction between two or more
individuals, a token is drawn from one of the urns (the
speaker); this corresponds to production. Token(s) of the
same type are then added to another urn(s) (the listener(s));
this corresponds to perception and update of knowledge.
Prestige is implemented as follows: when hearing a highprestige variant, a higher number of tokens are added to the
urn – at each time step, a token vi is drawn randomly from
the urn and returned with pi (the prestige of vi, all prestige
values form P) tokens of the same type. Model bias is

implemented thus – when hearing a token used by the highstatus individuals, hearers add more tokens of that type to
their urns than if the token is produced by a low-status
individual. Transmission error, or mutation, occurs when a
token is returned with some token(s) of different type(s).
The probability of mutation is a parameter in the model.

The Price Equation

€

The aim of the present study is to examine whether a
number of factors constitute selection pressures on variant
diffusion. A variant may come to dominate in a population
for several reasons: it may have intrinsic properties that
make it adaptive in its environment and it may therefore be
selected for. Alternatively, the random dynamics of
evolutionary drift may increase the frequency of the variant.
The virtue of the Price equation (Eq. 1), a tool from
evolutionary biology, is precisely that it splits change into
two components: selection and transmission, allowing us to
identify which one is causing evolutionary change.
(1)
Δx = Cov(si / s,xi )+ E(Δxi × si / s)
Here, xi is the feature value of vi, si is the fitness of vi, s is
the average fitness, ∆xi is the feature discrepancy of vi
between time steps, and ∆x is the expectation of feature
value change.
We apply the equation to trace change in the average
value of a quantifiable feature in a population between two
consecutive time steps in the computer model and calculate
the two terms: 1) The covariance between the feature value
xi and the fitness ratio si/s measures selection, or evolution
caused by fitness differences between different types of
variants. Consistent non-zero covariance values over the
course of a computer simulation indicates that feature xi is
under selective pressure. 2) The expectation of the product
of the fitness ratio si/s and the feature discrepancy ∆xi
measures evolution occurring at transmission, in other
words differences between parents and offspring variants.
Consistent non-zero expectation values indicate that feature
xi is undergoing transmission error such as mutation.
By quantifying a feature relevant for diffusion and
analyzing the average values of the components in the Price
equation over many simulation runs, we can identify the
selective pressures on this feature.

Identifying Selective Pressures on Linguistic
Diffusion
For the sake of simplicity, our models contain only two
variants, each characterized by a quantifiable feature F={1,
2}. Example quantifiable features include vowel length,
consonant voicing onset time or lexical item recall rate. A
simulation has a 100-agent population and 2000 interactions
among them (20 interactions per agent on average). We
conducted 1,000 simulations in each of four conditions:
• Variant prestige with and without transmission error
• Model bias with and without variant prestige
The result of each simulation consists of a record of the
proportions of variants of each type in each urn at each

1492

timestep. On this data, we calculate the Covariance and the
Expectation terms of the Price equation at 20 sampling
points evenly distributed along 2000 interactions. To
complement the Price equation, which traces changes, rather
than proportions, of variant types, we also calculate Prop
(see Equation 2) as the proportion of the majority variant
type at each sampling point.
(2)
By illustrating whether one type of variants gradually
diffuses to the population, the average Prop of the 1000
simulations helps to evaluate the conclusions drawn from
the Price equation.

Variant Prestige with and without Transmission
Error
Variant prestige encompasses intrinsic properties of the
variant – and not of the individuals carrying the variant –
that makes them more likely to be adopted by individuals.
Henrich and Gil-White (2001)’s study of prestige in cultural
transmission do not find an effect of variant prestige on
diffusion, although admittedly their focus was on model
bias, and variant prestige was implicitly subsumed within
that focus. In our simulations, each interaction occurs
between two randomly chosen agents. Differential variant
prestige is introduced via pi. For conditions with variant
prestige, P={1, 2}; for those without, P={1, 1}. If pi=2, two
tokens of the same type (instead of one) are added to the
listener’s urn, modeling the enhanced adoption of the highprestige variant. Transmission error is introduced via
mutation; c=0.02 is the probability that an added token
becomes a mutant (of the other type). Figure 1 shows the
simulation results in these conditions.

around 0.0 (the proportions of the values above, below, and
equal 0.0 are shown in the legend of Figure 1(a)). The
gradual decrease in the absolute value of covariance is due
to the increase in the total number of variants, which
reduces the effect of a small number of changed variants in
each interaction. The positivity of covariance clearly
indicates that variant prestige is a selective pressure on
diffusion. For expectation, with variant prestige, it becomes
consistently negative; otherwise, it fluctuates around 0.0.
This result suggests that transmission error can reduce the
selective pressure of variant prestige. However, due to the
low mutation rate, this effect is smaller than that of variant
prestige.
Figure 1(c) shows the Prop in these conditions. With
variant prestige, v2, with the higher prestige value, becomes
the majority type and its Prop gradually reaches a high level
(above 0.8)1; without variant prestige, either type can
become the majority type, but the small bias towards either
type (due to random factors in early interactions) cannot be
further amplified in later interactions, so Prop remains
around 0.5. This result confirms the selective pressure of
variant prestige, consistent with the conclusion drawn from
the Price equation. Figure 1(c) also shows the Prop in the
conditions with transmission error (the dotted lines). With
variant prestige, the Prop with transmission error is lower
than that without, showing that transmission error reduces
the selective pressure of variant prestige; without variant
prestige, the Prop with and without transmission error are
similarly low, around 0.5, showing that transmission error
alone has no significant effect on diffusion. This result also
confirms the conclusion drawn from the Price equation.
The mathematical analyses based on the Price equation
applied to the simulation results using the diffusion model
formally show that variant prestige is indeed a selective
pressure on diffusion and transmission error can reduce such
pressure, but transmission error alone fails to consistently
drive the diffusion.
The consistent positivity (or negativity) of the covariance
based on variant feature identifies selective pressures on
diffusion. In the following sections, therefore, we focus on
covariance, and leave aside conditions without transmission.

Model bias reflects the phenomenon that members in a
community tend to copy the variants, regardless of the
actual forms, from certain individuals. It has been claimed
that such bias could enhance the benefits of cultural
transmission (Henrich & Gil-White, 2001). We analyze two
types of model bias.
The first type involves a single high-status agent. Here, a
single agent has a bias value of 2, and the other 99 agents’
bias value is 1. Variant prestige and model bias take effect
jointly during interactions. Without variant prestige, when
the high-status agent speaks, the hearer adds 2 tokens of the
1

Prop never reaches 100%, because the tokens of the other type
are not removed.

The second type of model bias concerns multiple
individuals. The bias towards an individual is defined as the
probability for this individual to participate in interactions,
and all probabilities follow a normalized, power-law
distribution (Newman, 2005). This implementation is
inspired on empirical data (Newman, 2003), and has been
adopted in previous work (e.g., Gong et al., 2008). In this
paper, we only consider the power-law distributions whose λ
values are 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.02.
Figure 3 shows the results under the second type of model
bias. Similar to the first type, the second type of model bias
alone fails to exert a selective pressure; it has to take effect
together with variant prestige. This conclusion is shown by
comparing the Covariance in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), and
confirmed by the Prop in Figures 3(c) and 3(d).
In addition, the Prop in the conditions with variant prestige
seems correlated with the λ values (see Figure 3(d)). To
illustrate such correlation, we define MaxRange (see
Equation 3) as the maximum changing range of Prop:
(3)
MaxRange = max (Prop(t)− Prop(0))

agents will increase, quickly spread to others, and get
further amplified after many interactions. However, without
variant prestige, the variant bias in the biased agents
remains small and cannot be amplified enough to increase
substantially the proportion of one variant type. Therefore,
the correlation between the MaxRange and the λ becomes
less explicit.

produced type; when another agent speaks, the hearer adds 1
token of the produced type. With variant prestige, when the
high-status agent produces a token of the prestigious type,
the hearer adds 4 tokens of that type; when it produces a
token of the other type, the hearer adds 2 tokens of that type;
and when another agent speaks, the update is the same as in
the condition with only variant prestige.
Figure 2 shows the results under this type of model bias.
Without variant prestige, the Covariance fluctuates around
0.0; otherwise, it is consistently positive (see Figure 2(a)).
These results show that the first type of model bias alone
fails to exert a selective pressure; it has to take effect
together with variant prestige. This conclusion can be
confirmed by the Prop in Figure 2(b): without variant
prestige, the Prop remains slightly higher than 0.5;
otherwise, it approaches 1.0.

The power-law distributed model bias reflects the
omnipresent scaling law in social and cognitive domains
(Kello et al., 2010). Our simulations show that in order for
such a scaling characteristic to significantly affect diffusion,
variant prestige is necessary. In addition, the correlation
between the degree of diffusion and λ values in our study is
different from that shown in other studies. For example,
Gong et al. (2008) observe a threshold λ value (around 1.0),
below or above which the spread of linguistic knowledge is
less efficient – but our diffusion model differs from that of
Gong et al. (2008) in that they explicitly modeled lexical
and syntactic information. This different performance
indicates that different types of linguistic knowledge may
follow different diffusion trajectories in the population.

Discussions, Conclusions and Future work
Our study demonstrates that, of the factors studied, only
variant prestige explicitly driving the spread of variants with
higher prestige values in the population, whereas other
individual learning or socio-cultural factors, such as
transmission error or model bias, can take effect only if

1494

variant prestige is involved. As shown in our study,
transmission error simply introduces noise in the effect of
variant prestige, and model bias does not pose a selection
pressure. However, if variant prestige is also present, the
strength of selection for the high-prestige variant can be
modulated by the distribution of individual status in the
population.
Our findings indicate that external, domain-general
factors, such as individual status, must take effect via
intrinsic, domain-specific factors, such as variant prestige.
In linguistics, this finding also alerts us not to exaggerate
the effect of language-external factors and inspires us to reevaluate conclusions in previous studies (e.g., Henrich &
Gil-White, 2001). Meanwhile, the Pólya urn dynamics is a
general transmission framework not specific to linguistic
communication, and the simulation results are less
dependent on population size, variant number, or interaction
number. Additionally, the Price equation provides a concise
description of evolutionary processes that abstracts away
from the specific properties of biological evolution (Jäger,
2008; Gardner, 2008). These aspects make this finding also
instructive to other phenomena that involve socio-cultural
transmission.
Computer simulation and mathematical analysis jointly
establish a theoretical platform for linguistic research
(Loreto & Steels, 2007). Our work exemplifies how these
two approaches assist each other to explore the target
question. The conclusions drawn from the Price equation are
difficult to prove purely mathematically, but they are nicely
assessed by the proportions of the majority variant type in
the simulations. The simulations can further examine the
complementary roles of individual learning and sociocultural factors in diffusion. When variants have differential
variant prestige, transmission error delays the diffusion
process and helps to preserve the tokens of less prestigious
type; model bias accelerates the diffusion by spreading and
amplifying the bias towards prestigious variants, and there
is a correlation between the degree of diffusion and that of
model bias.
Finally, some aspects of this study can be modified in
order to explore further questions on the diffusion of
linguistic and other cultural variants. Among possible
manipulations we find: changing the structure of the social
network, the population structure over time – for instance
adding generation turnover involving death of agents and
birth of new agents or implementing frequency-dependent
prestige. These modifications and others are easily feasible
within the combination of computer simulation based on the
Pólya urn model and mathematical analysis using the Price
equation presented here.
