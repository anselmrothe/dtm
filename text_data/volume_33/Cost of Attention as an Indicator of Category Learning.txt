                       Experiment 1
Methods
Participants Twenty-five adults with normal or corrected to
normal vision participated in the experiment. Participants
were undergraduate students at The Ohio State University
participating for course credit. An additional 17 participants
were excluded where 5 of them had problems tracking their
eye movements, 4 missed the catcher trials (see Procedure),
and 8 did not learn the category.
Stimuli For the practice phase, two artificial categories that
look like molecules were used on a black background (see
Figure 1). Molecules consisted of five circles where four
changed colors in a binary fashion and one remained
constant throughout the practice phase, serving as a category
relevant feature. There were 16 category members for each
molecule category where the only difference between the
categories was the color of the constant feature. The
category relevant feature was always the upper left circle,
which was purple in one category and yellow in the other
category. For the main experiment, four artificial categories
that looked like flowers were used (see Figure 1). Presented
on a black background, each exemplar had a dark gray
hexagon in the middle that was constant for every category                      Figure 1. Stimuli used in the experiment.
