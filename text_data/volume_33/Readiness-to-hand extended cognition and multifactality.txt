Heidegger's concepts describe the participant's experience of
the situation. Importantly, the burden of determining what is
“in” and what is “outside” the system falls not on the
intuitive identification of the system's border with its skin
but on quantifying the richness of interaction among all
sections taking part in the task space.
   Additionally, we used a second “probe” to get a hint of
the participants’ cognitive reorganization during the task.
By having participants count backwards by three in the
range of three-digit numbers while using the mouse we
could detect any significant shift of attention between the
two tasks; we expected that such shifts would coincide with          Figure 2: Averaged scaling exponents from Experiment 1

   The method described so far leaves us with a single
scaling parameter. In order to check for multifractality, we
need to “bias” the analysis towards fluctuations of a smaller
or larger scale. This is performed using the moment q.
Accordingly, we calculate Zq(a) using the qth powers of the
local maxima in the wavelet transform and then we arrive at
a spectrum of scaling exponents τ(q), Zq(α) ~ ατ(q). Negative        Figure 4: Using a representative 15-second section of a trial.

proven that the singularity spectrum h(q), the main target of
the analysis, is simply the derivative τ'(q) and, consequently,      questions as ours (Amaral et al., 2001; Struzik, Hayano,
                                                                     Sakata, Kwak, & Yamamoto, 2004).
a linear relation in the plot of the fractal spectrum τ(q)
versus q (see Figure 5a) reveals a constant h(q) or
monofractal behavior of the signal, whereas decelerating
τ(q) leads to a decreasing h(q) (see Figure 5b) and is the
result of multifractal behavior (Muzy et al., 1993).
   A final measure that is needed is D(hi ), the fractal
dimension of the set of zero-dimensional objects that are the
indexes of the original time series where one finds
singularities characterized by hi. In the limit where the
original time series consists only of singularities of kind h,
their indexes form a continuous line, a one-dimensional
object and, hence, D(h) will be equal to unity. Here we can
