abductive reasoning task that employs a gene mapping
technique called a three-factor cross (3FC). In a 3FC
problem, two organisms, e.g., fruit flies are crossed and the
pattern of offspring phenotypes that result is analyzed to
infer (1) the order of three genes that lie on one
chromosome, and (2) the relative distances between gene
pairs. Students can solve these problems algorithmically
without reference to genetics, but the goal of this project is
to ground student reasoning in the underlying process
