Abstract: Contrary to our naı̈ve understanding that ideas for innovation are generated by supply-side such as prod-
uct developers, studies suggest that ideas can be generated by consumers, especially the group of users called ”early
adopters” who behave differently from product developers in regard to product adoption and general knowledge.
This research includes an experiment with consumers to test what is more influential in idea generation for innova-
tion: information, i.e. previous ideas about new uses of a product, or individual adoption category, i.e. innovator or
early adopter. The result suggests that ”information” is more influential in generating creative ideas for innovation,
and early adopters, rather than innovators, make effective use of information in idea generation. An additional
experiment for information retrieval suggests that innovators tend to avoid communication with non-innovators and
focus more on the function and specifications of the product, potentially decreasing their performance in creative
idea generation.
