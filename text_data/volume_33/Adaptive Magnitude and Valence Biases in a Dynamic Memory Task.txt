                        Experiment
Traditional episodic memory experiments present a series of
individual items with no indication that any item is more
important than any other. In contrast, our experiment varies
both the arrangement of items at study (simultaneous or
sequential) and the value distribution of the studied items.
Two value distributions employed were evenly spaced, but
shifted to be mostly negative or mostly positive: will
participants focus more on the oddball positive (or negative,
resp.) stimuli in these conditions? The other two value
distributions were symmetric about zero, but the magnitude
of the most extreme values differed: will participants
remember extreme-valued items twice the value of the
middling items (e.g., 20 vs. 10) as well as when they are ten
times the value (e.g., 100 vs. 10)? Overall, will participants
better remember positive or negative items?

   To determine whether the magnitude sensitivity and
valence bias in accuracy extend to the time domain, we first
examine participants’ median time to make a first
movement. Time until first movement in our continuous
time paradigm may be equivalent to reaction time in
traditional experiments, although it is also bounded by the
drop speed of objects. Time pressure was not extreme: mean
