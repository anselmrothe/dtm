  Psychological tests often employ repeated trials of similar
or identical tasks. Sometimes, these repetitions are intended
to allow subjects to acclimatize to the stimulus and/or
decision making paradigms, e.g., as in forced choice
experiments (Mitchell & Jolley, 2009). Indeed, in
psychoacoustic experiments, subjects may be unable to even
distinguish phenomena of interest without substantial prior
exposure and early practice rounds are commonly discarded
as uninformative.

Subjective organization as explained in (Ramakers et al.,                where ̅        ()  is the (normalized) primacy score on trial i,
2008) was measured for a patient between subsequent trials
for the first five trials (trial 1 and trial 2, trial 2 and trial 3,
trial 3 and trial 4, trial 4 and trial 5). Subjective
organization is calculated for trial i to i+1 as

         where j is the number of pairs of items recalled on
trial i and i+1 in adjacent positions, c is the number of
common items recalled on both trial, h is the number of
items recalled on trial i and k is the number of items recalled
on trial i+1. Serial position primacy was calculated as
described in (La Rue, et al., 2008) for the first five trials,
where primacy was the percentage of the first four words
