Abstract: When young infants are presented with statistical patterns in an extremely sparse environment, they
demonstrate remarkable skill for learning deterministic relations among visual and auditory features (Kirkham et
al., 2002; Fiser & Aslin, 2002; Saffran et al., 1996). While statistical learning is suggested to support complex
skills such as object processing and language, previous studies have failed to test its robustness amid variability and
distraction typical of the natural world. Variations in sequence probability have been shown to modulate infantsâ€™
attention (Kidd et al., 2010) and are therefore predicted to impact learning. In an eye-tracking study, 8-month-olds
were presented with sequences of visual events that differed within-subjects in their transitional probabilities from
deterministic to random and differed between-subjects in the presence or absence of noise events. Results suggest
that infants are indeed able to learn visual patterns with probabilistic transitions, but their learning is differentially
affected by increases in noise.
