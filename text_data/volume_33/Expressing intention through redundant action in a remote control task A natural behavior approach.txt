Abstract: Individuals often act out intended actions in situations where they are unnecessary or have no impact on
the execution of that intention. We refer to these behaviors as redundant actions. Despite the apparently superfluous
nature of redundant actions, they are frequently produced in certain situations and have the potential to provide
insight into the embodied nature of intentions. One clear example of this behavior comes from video game playing
whereby individuals have a tendency to lean in the direction they wish an object or character they are in control of
to go. By having participants play a racing video game, we were able to create a controlled environment to observe
these behaviors. By manipulating aspects of player immersion, control input, and temporal demand, we investigate
what factors lead individuals to express intentions via redundant actions.
