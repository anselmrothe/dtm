Results. In the regression analyses reported, we excluded
two items (cod and cad) as listeners were unable to recog-
nize any variant as voiced. Examining the reaction times,
we removed every data point above 2.5 standard deviations
from the overall mean and every data point below 500 ms.
Based on these criteria, 10% of the data were excluded from
all analyses. To examine the interaction of lexical frequency
and phonetic variability, we ran a mixed-effect logistic regres-
sion predicting voiced responses on all the subjects (with sub-
ject and item as random effects). The condition (Variance or
NoVariance), the ratio of lexical frequencies of the words in
the pair (FreqRatio), the lexical frequency of the word clicked
on by the participant (FreqChoice), and the lexical frequency
of the word not chosen (FreqOther) were included as fixed
effects. The fixed effects of the model, as well as the interac-
tion between the variance condition and the frequency ratio,
are presented in Table 1.
   We found significant main effects of the frequency ratio of
the words in the pair (voiced word frequency/voiceless word
frequency) as well as the frequency of the word clicked on
by the subject. Importantly, the interaction between the fre-
quency ratio and the variability condition just missed signifi-      Figure 2: Percent voiced responses dependent on frequency
