proportion in Figure 4. This proportion is constant which is
what Weber's law predicts.
   The bump appears to be due to the limited granularity of
using a binary representation of arm position. It is important
to note that the simplifying assumptions about bodily
representaion (binary, linear) are likely to impair network
performance. Using a non-binary representation would
provide greater information. Whilst Fitts Law states that the
motor system obeys a power law which suggests that motor
representations also possess scalar properties. Similarly, in
the current model, body position is used both to calibrate the
sensory modalites and as a proxy representaion of time
quantities. As an infant matures it is likely that its time
representations will become more abstract, although it is
beyond the scope of this paper to demonstrate this. In line
with Walsh's (2003) ATOM model, we expect the brain to
recruit regions of the cortex that represent quantity
logarithmically. Future iterations of this model will
investigate both these refinements.                                      Figure 5: Correlation between network predictions in two
