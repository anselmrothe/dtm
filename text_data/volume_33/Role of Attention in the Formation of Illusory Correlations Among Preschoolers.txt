case participants first learned about the properties of all
of the individuals from the common category and then
learned about the properties of all of the individuals
from rare category. We expected that presenting
information in this way would cause an attention-shift
from the common category to the rare category and that
this shift in attention would lead to the formation of an
illusory correlation. Critically, we expect that children
will associate the frequent property to the common
property, and as a consequence of the attention shift,
they will expect the other (infrequent) property is
associated with the rare category. If, on the other hand,
these young children are simply unable to form illusory
correlations – perhaps because they are disposed to
attend to the correlational structure of the evidence –
then the results should replicate those found in
Experiment 1.
