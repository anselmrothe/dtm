                               Abstract
   Referring expressions (such as the red chair facing right) of-
   ten show evidence of preferences (Pechmann, 1989; Belke &
   Meyer, 2002), with some attributes (e.g. colour) being more
   frequent and more often included when they are not required,
   leading to overspecified references. This observation underlies
   many computational models of Referring Expression Genera-
   tion, especially those influenced by Dale & Reiter’s (1995) In-
   cremental Algorithm. However, more recent work has shown
   that in interactive settings, priming can alter preferences. This
   paper provides further experimental evidence for these phe-                             Figure 1: A referential domain

                   Computational REG
Dale and Reiter’s (1995) Incremental Algorithm (IA) has
emerged as one of the most influential computational REG
models. In searching for a distinguishing combination of at-
tributes for a target referent, the IA uses a preference order
to model preferences. For example, the attributes in Figure 1
could be ordered by preference as TYPE > COLOUR > ORI -
ENTATION . To identify an intended referent r, the algorithm
traverses the preference order, checking at each stage whether
r’s value on a given attribute excludes some distractors. The
algorithm terminates when a referent has been fully distin-
guished, or when it runs out of attributes to choose from. For       Figure 2: The Interactive Reference Understanding and Pro-
