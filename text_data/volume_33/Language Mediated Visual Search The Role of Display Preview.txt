Abstract
Visual search efficiency is increased when the search target’s
identity is revealed incrementally via language while the
display is in view. One view posits that search efficiency is
increased because language enhances perceptual processing.
We examined an alternative view that increased efficiency is
due to delaying the onset of target-seeking eye movements,
allowing a preview of the search array. Two eye-tracking
experiments tested these alternatives. Observed patterns of
eye movements indicated that increased efficiency with
concurrent language was not likely due to linguistic
enhancement of perceptual processes.

Introduction
In visual search for a target defined by one feature
(feature search) reaction times are independent of the
number of distractors. In contrast, when the target is defined
by two features (conjunction search), reaction times increase
with the number of distractors. This effect is mitigated when
different kinds of information are made available before
search begins. For example, knowledge of what color subset
the target will appear in (e.g., Egeth, Virzi, & Garbart, 1984,
Friedman-Hill & Wolfe, 1995), a preview of non-target
locations (e.g., Watson & Humphreys, 1997, 2002), and a
preview of locations that potentially do contain the target
(e.g., Hannus et al., 2006; Olds, Cowan, & Jolicœur, 2000a,
2000b; Rutishauser & Koch, 2007) all reduce the effect of
an increasing number of distractors (set size). When search
time is independent of set size, the search process is said to
be efficient.
Spivey, Tyler, Eberhard, & Tanenhaus (2001) provided
evidence that visual search efficiency can be mediated
linguistically. Participants were presented a classic
conjunction search task in which they had to indicate the
presence or absence of a target defined by both color and
orientation. When the target’s identity was revealed
incrementally through speech (e.g., ‘red horizontal’) while
the search display was in view, search was as efficient as in
feature search (as indexed by near zero response time by set
size functions). This benefit to search is termed linguistic
assistance.
To account for this increase in efficiency, it was proposed
that, due to the incremental nature of language, the
perception of the auditory stimulus (e.g., the word ‘red’)
together with perception of features of the visual stimulus
(the color red) enhanced the salience of the subset of items
matched to this feature in the cognitive representation of the

search display (i.e., the salience map; see Reali et al., 2006
for an elaboration of this point). Spivey et al.’s
interpretation of this interaction between language and
perceptual processing was that participants executed two
nested feature searches instead of a single conjunction
search.
The concept of nested feature search is not well specified
in the visual search literature. To our knowledge the concept
was introduced by Spivey et al. (2001) to explain their
results. Based on their description, two nested feature
searches can be thought of as a sequence of pop-out
searches. First, the (spatially noncontiguous) subset of items
matching the color named in the linguistic cue is isolated
attentionally due to the increased salience of these items.
Then, the oddly oriented target pops-out from within this
set. For example, as soon as participants hear the word ‘red’
(or enough of it to distinguish it from the word from
’green’), the salience of the red subset of items in the
display is boosted relative to the salience of the green items.
This effectively reduces the number of items to be searched
by half and makes the presence of an item of differing
orientation easily detectable in the set of red items. The
critical idea here is that hearing a word that describes the
target’s features automatically biases the perceptual system
towards items that match that feature by means of
enhancement in the salience map.
Gibson, Eberhard, and Bryant (2005),
however,
demonstrated that the benefit of linguistic assistance
reported by Spivey et al. (2001) is limited to slow speech
rate (3.0 syllables/second) or to smaller set sizes with faster
speech rate (4.8 syllables/second). Slower speech would
provide participants with more viewing time of the search
display before hearing the identity of the target. That is,
more viewing of the search display provides additional
information about potential target locations independently
of the information conveyed by the speech cue.
Evidence of linguistic assistance suggests that top-down
processing can bias perceptual processes towards certain
environmental features to enhance bottom-up information.
Therefore, evidence that these effects are due to other
(bottom-up) information acquired before search begins,
would place important constraints on what influence topdown processing can have on bottom-up processes.
The present study tests these accounts by examining eye
movement data while participants performed conjunction
visual searches. If the benefit of linguistic assistance
reported by Spivey et al. (2001) is the result of nested
feature searches it should be reflected in eye movements.
The pattern of reaction time data and eye movement data

should be more similar to patterns observed during feature
rather than conjunction search. In single feature searches
both RT slopes and fixation slopes are shallower with fewer
fixations overall than in conjunction searches (Williams et
al., 1997; Zelinsky & Sheinberg, 1997). Consider how the
data would differ between a single and a nested pair of
feature searches. By definition, a feature search is one in
which search is highly efficient. That is, RTs and fixations
are less dependent on set size than in a conjunction search.
A second feature search would add a constant to the RT and
fixation count. The slope would still be very shallow but the
y-intercept would increase by the amount of time it takes to
resolve the second feature (cf. Watson & Humphreys, 1997;
Watson & Inglis, 2007). This is exactly what Spivey et al.
(2001) report for their RT by set size functions, but they
attributed the increase in y-intercept to the delay in hearing
the word describing the second feature (i.e., orientation:
vertical or horizontal).
Thus, if greater efficiency with linguistic assistance is a
result of nested feature searches the RT and fixation by set
size slopes should be shallower than in a condition in which
the target is revealed before each trial. On the other hand, if
the increased search efficiency is due to previewing of the
display there should be a delay of target-seeking saccades
with linguistic assistance as participants sample the search
display before the search target identity is fully revealed. If
this is the case, then search efficiency as indexed by
measures of fixations will more similar that of conjunction
search than feature search.
In order to test these hypotheses, we replicated Spivey et
al.’s (2001) Experiment 1. We established three criteria for
evaluating participants’ eye movements to determine
whether they were performing two nested feature searches.
The first criterion, used by Spivey et al. and Reali et al.
(2006), is shallower RT by set size function. This measure is
widely accepted as an indicator of feature search. The
second criterion is the fixation by set size slope, which
should be smaller in two nested feature searches than in a
serial conjunction search. The third criterion is the average
distance from the location of the last fixation to the target
location which should be larger in nested feature search than
in conjunction search.
As mentioned above, the notion of nested feature searches
is not well specified. A close approximation to Spivey et
al.’s (2001) description can be found in visual searches in
which part of the visual display is previewed prior to the
onset of the entire display. Watson and Inglis (2007) found
that “nested” feature searches (their Preview condition) had
the same RT by set size slope as the single feature search
(their Half Element Baseline condition) but larger intercepts
which reflects a delay in target-seeking eye movements as a
result of showing one subset of items followed by the other.
This is consistent with the findings using linguistic
assistance in which the onset of target-seeking eye
movements was delayed due to incrementally revealing the
search target identity and not the distractor sets in the search
display.

Regarding fixations, Watson and Inglis (2007) reported
that a “nested” feature search was identical to the single
feature search in both slope and mean number of fixations
and both measures were less than the slope and intercept of
the conjunction search.
The third criterion is based on the logic that if on target
present trials the search target is detected via pop-out then
the distance of the location of the last fixation to the location
of the target should on average be larger in (nested) feature
searches than in conjunction. For example, in Boot, Becic,
and Kramer (2009) participants performed an efficient
search (titled among vertical lines) and an inefficient search
(T among Ls). To evaluate the effect of search task on last
fixation to target location distance, we reanalyzed their data
using a 2 Search Task (efficient, inefficient) between by 3
Set Size (4, 8, 12) within mixed-design ANOVA. The
distance of the last fixation location to the target location for
the efficient search (M = 226.58 pixels) was much greater
than that in the inefficient search (M = 68.93 pixels),
F(1,78) = 18.71, p < .001. The average distance of the last
fixation to the target decreased for larger set sizes, F(2,156)
= 3.75, p = .026. The interaction was not significant, F < 1.

Experiment 1
In order to create eye-movement profiles an experiment
was conducted to replicate findings reported in Spivey et
al.’s (2001) Experiment 1, in which the target identity was
revealed to participants either before the start of each trial
(Advanced) or while the search display was in plain view
(Concurrent) via an audio file that contained the query “Is
there a [color] [orientation]?” Eye-movements were
recorded in both conditions.
If increased efficiency in the Concurrent condition is a
result of two nested feature searches then search slopes and
means calculated for response latencies and number of
fixations should be shallower than in the Advanced
condition. Furthermore, overall distance to the target of the
last fixation on a trial should be larger in the Concurrent
condition than in the Advanced condition.
Methods
Participants Twenty students at Florida State University
participated for partial course credit. All participants
reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Stimuli Four sound files were created by splicing
recordings of each of the spoken color and orientation
adjectives into the end of one sound file that contained the
opening query “Is there a…” using a digital audio editor
(Audacity). The duration of the query was 998 ms and the
average duration of each final sound file was 2357 ms for an
average of 3.18 syllables per second.
The search displays contained red and green rectangles
randomly distributed across an invisible 8x8 matrix on a
black background that occupied approximately 21° of visual
angle both vertically and horizontally at a viewing distance
of 60 cm. The rectangles subtended 2.1° of visual angle in

length and 1° of visual angle in width. Adjacent rectangles
were separated by an average of 2.6°. Each display included
red-vertical and green-horizontal or red-horizontal and
green-vertical distractor rectangles plus one target rectangle
with a unique combination of color and orientation relative
to the other objects in the display. Set sizes were 5, 10, 15,
and 20. Displays were created by randomly placing the
rectangles in the 8x8 matrix for a total of 320 trials with 40
target present and 40 target absent displays in each set size.
Participants saw the same 320 displays in random order.
Apparatus Eye movements were recorded with an Eyelink
CL (SR Research) eye tracker sampling from the right eye
at 1000 Hz and a spatial resolution of 0.1°. An eye
movement was considered to be a saccade if its acceleration
reached 8,000°/sec2 or its velocity reached 30°/sec. The
display presentation was controlled by a Pentium PC
attached to a CRT monitor placed 60 cm away from a chin
rest. The display resolution was 1024 by 768 pixels. A 9point calibration and validation procedure was used.
Procedure Participants responded with right- and lefttrigger button presses on a game controller to indicate target
presence or absence, respectively. Each trial began with a
drift correction which was immediately followed by a
fixation cross for 250 ms. In the Concurrent condition the
fixation cross remained on the display for another 1000 ms
while the preamble, “Is there a…”, was presented auditorily.
The onset of the search display and the spoken color
adjective were synchronized such that the distractors were
in full view while the identity of the target was
incrementally revealed. In the Advanced condition the
search target was visually presented for 1000 ms after which
it was immediately replaced by the search display. In both
conditions the search display remained on the screen until a
response was made. On each trial feedback was visually
displayed for 1000 ms that indicated if the given response
was correct or incorrect. Participants were asked to respond
as quickly as they could without sacrificing accuracy.

Results
On each trial latency and accuracy of the response was
recorded as well as the location and number of fixations.
Any fixation that fell within a 40 pixel radius from the
center of one of the 60 by 30 pixel rectangle stimuli was
considered to be an object fixation. Trials with saccade
latencies greater than 80 ms, RTs greater than 3000 ms and
with incorrect responses were excluded from analysis.
The data for each measure are presented in Figure 1. Note
that these data replicate the pattern of increased search
efficiency in the Concurrent condition reported by Spivey et
al. (2001) for the RT analysis. The critical Set Size by
Target Presentation interaction was significant, F(3,54)=
6.74, p=.001. For target present trials the slope in the
Concurrent condition (12.73) was significantly shallower
than the Advanced condition (21.72), F(1,18)=12.78,
p=.002, but only marginally significant for target absent
trials (27.7 v. 38.4), F(1,18)=3.14, p=.093. As expected,
mean response latencies in the Concurrent condition (1735
ms) were longer than those in the Advanced condition (1237
ms), F(1,18)=20.15, p<.001.
For analysis of Number of Fixations neither the critical
Set Size by Target Presentation interaction on cell means
nor the Target Presentation main effect of the slopes were
significant, Fs<1.2. There were however, overall more
fixations per trial in the Concurrent condition (4.44) than in
the Advanced condition (3.04), F(1,18)=13.54, p=.003.
The only significant effect in the Distance analysis was
the main effect of Set Size, F(3,54)=16.76, p<.001, which
suggests that in both conditions searched more objects as
Set Size increased. All other Fs<1.2.
More errors were made in target present than target absent
trials, F(1,18)=31.90, p<.001, and as the Set Size increased,
F(3,54)=5.98, p=.001, but were equal between Target
Presentation conditions, F<1.2, although the Set Size by
Target
Presentation
was
marginally
significant,
F(3,54)=2.40, p=.078. Finally, there was greater increase in
errors as Set Size increased for target present trials than for
target absent trials, F(3,54)=3.39, p=.024.

Discussion
The Concurrent condition only passed one of three criteria
that one would expect to find if it was a result of two nested
feature searches. Greater efficiency in the Concurrent
condition, as indexed by RT by Set Size slopes, must be a
result of something other than nested feature searches.
Gibson et al. (2005) reported that language assistance
yielded shallower slopes for larger distractor sets when the
speech rate was slow but not when it was fast. This finding
suggests that slowing participants’ search may be the source
of greater efficiency as indexed by shallower RT slopes.
To evaluate eye movements for the onset of targetseeking saccades, two additional analyses were conducted
by comparing eye movements on the first five fixations per
trial in the Concurrent condition to the Advanced condition
on target present trials. In the first analysis, fixations to
objects of either color (Objects) was the dependent measure
and in the second analysis the proportion of fixations to
objects of the same color as the target (Matching Objects)
was the dependent measure. The data are presented in Table
1. For both sets of data a 5 within (Fixation Number) by 2
between (Target Presentation) mixed ANOVA was
conducted. As can be seen in the table, the proportion of
fixations to Objects across all five fixations was the same in
both the Concurrent and Advanced conditions. This
conclusion is consistent with a non-significant main effect
of Target Presentation and a non-significant interaction of
Fixation Number by Target Presentation (both Fs<1). There
was a significant main effect of Fixation, F(4,72)=51.28,
p<.001, which was driven by the fact that the first fixation
was less likely to be directed towards an individual object.
The importance of these analyses is that in terms of
looking at objects of any color the Concurrent and
Advanced conditions cannot be considered different. In
contrast, the analysis of Matching Objects indicates that
participants in the Advanced condition made target-seeking
saccades earlier in a trial. In this analysis the critical twoway interaction was significant, F(4,72)=3.09, p=.02. As
can be seen in the Table, on the first fixation participants in
both conditions looked at Matching Objects at a rate close to
chance (0.5). However, during the second, third, and fourth
fixations participants in the Advanced condition looked at
significantly more Matching Objects than in the Concurrent
condition. Participants in the Concurrent condition did not
begin looking at Matching Objects at a rate above chance
until the third fixation. Also, they did not fixate Matching
Objects at the same rate as participants in the Advanced
condition again until the fifth fixation. Because participants
in the Concurrent condition did not know what they were
searching for until between 300 and 600 ms into a trial, they
were getting a preview of the display for about 500 to 600
ms, about two saccades, before starting their search.
These observations suggest that greater efficiency in the
Concurrent condition may be a result of having more
information about the display and not the content of the
language, per se. Thus, if participants could be delayed in
initiating target-seeking saccades, by means other than the

incremental feature of language, while also having a period
of preview of the search display the RT and Fixation search
slopes should be similar to those in the Concurrent
condition.

Experiment 2
The purpose of Experiment 2 was to create conditions that
yielded search slopes and means that met all of the three
criteria of two nested feature searches described previously.
To do so, participants were prohibited from making any
saccades at the beginning of each trial for 350 or 750 ms
with the search display in plain view. If more efficient
search in the Concurrent condition is a result of slowing
responding then delaying participants’ ability to initiate
saccades at the beginning of each trial should estimate the
RT slopes of the Concurrent condition. However, it is
anticipated that with a sufficient delay the first one or two
non-target-seeking saccades found in the Concurrent
condition will not occur in the present experiment which
would reduce the overall number of fixations and the
fixation slopes. Also because of the preview, it is anticipated
that the location of the last fixation relative to the search
target will be greater than in the Concurrent condition. Thus,
the current experiment is not intended to fully replicate the
Concurrent condition. Rather it is intended to be a
demonstration of what the eye movement profile of search
with a delay in target-seeking saccades would be like.
Differences on criteria two and three between Experiment 2
and the Concurrent condition of Experiment 1 are expected
to be, at least partially, accounted for by the lack of nontarget-seeking saccades at the beginning of each trial in
Experiment 2.

latencies (A), mean number of fixations per trial (B), and mean distance to target location from location of the last fixation
per trial (C). Error bars represent ± 1 standard error of the mean pooled across set size.
Procedure After viewing the search target for 1000 ms,
participants saw a fixation cross in the center of the display
for 300 ms. At this point the search display was presented
while the fixation cross remained on the screen for either
350 ms (Short Delay condition) or 750 ms (Long Delay
condition) at which time the fixation cross disappeared
while the rest of the search display remained. Participants
were required to maintain their gaze at this central fixation
until it disappeared which was their cue to begin their
search. Trials on which eye movements traversed an
invisible boundary with a diameter of 100 pixels around the
fixation cross were forfeited.
Results
Trials with incorrect responses or RTs greater than 3000 ms
were discarded. RTs were measured from the end of the
delay period to the response. The data are displayed in
Figure 2. For RTs, the critical Set Size by Delay condition
interaction was significant, F(3,45)=2.86, p=.047. For target
present trials the search slope was shallower in the Long
Delay (11.6) than in the Short Delay (20.34),
F(1,15)=15.65, p=.001, but not for target absent trials,
F<1.4, p>.25. Overall responses were slower with a Short
Delay (866 ms) than with a Long Delay (653 ms),
F(1,15)=141.44, p<.001.
For the analysis of the Number of Fixations, the Set Size
by Delay condition interaction was significant,
F(3,45)=3.58, p=.021. Search slopes were shallower in the
Long Delay than in the Short Delay condition in both target
absent (.13 vs. .16), F(1,15)=5.76, p=.03, and the target
present condition (.04 vs. .06), F(1,15)=12.29, p=.003.
There were more fixations in the Short Delay (2.08) than in
the Long Delay condition (1.83), F(1,15)=29.82, p<.001.
For the Distance analysis, the Set Size by Delay
interaction was significant, F(3,45)=10.96, p<.001, with
longer distance between the target location and that of the
fixation at response in the Long Delay (237 pixels) than in
the Short Delay (216 pixels), F(1,15)=33.62, p<.001. As in
Experiment 1, the main effect of Set Size was significant,

F(3,45)=36.80 p<.001, which suggests that in both
conditions searched more objects as Set Size increased
Regarding errors, the Target by Set Size interaction was
significant, F(3,45)=5.26, p<.003, indicating more errors as
set size increased in the target present condition than in the
target absent condition. There were overall more errors in
the Long Delay condition, F(1,15)=5.66, p=.031, when
targets were present, F(1,15)=7.84, p=.013, and as set size
increased, F(1,15)=4.86, p=.005.

Discussion
The purpose of Experiment 2 was to evaluate search
performance with a substantial free viewing period but
without saccades. This was achieved by delaying the onset
of target-seeking saccades relative to the onset of the search
display. Search was more efficient with a longer delay.
Delaying search by 750 ms resulted in an eye movement
profile that satisfies all of the three criteria established for
two nested feature searches.

General Discussion
The two experiments reported in this study provide
evidence of limitations on higher-order cognitive processes,
such as language processing, to directly constrain perceptual
processes such as visual search. The first experiment
replicated the finding reported by Spivey et al. (2001) that
incrementally revealing the search target auditorily (as
speech) concurrently with the visual search display reduces
the slope of the RT by Set Size function in a conjunction
visual search. A lack of evidence for nested feature searches
in the eye-tracking data, however, suggests that this
apparent increase in efficiency may be due to increased
information about the display before the full identity of the
search target was known. It appears that the first two
saccades on a trial function to sample the search display in
preparation for target-seeking saccades once the full identity
of the search target is known. As a result of this delay
responses in the Concurrent condition were slowed relative
to the Advanced condition when the set size was small

rather than speeded when the set size was large.
Importantly, the second experiment further clarifies the
benefits of (covertly) sampling the search display prior to
the initiation of eye movements for the purposes of search.
In conjunction visual search, top-down processes may only
begin to influence the search process once the search display
has been sufficiently sampled, in this case by covert shifts of
attention.
The purpose of the delay manipulation of Experiment 2
was to demonstrate conditions under which eye movements
during visual search would exhibit characteristics of search
after previewing of the display. In fact, when the full search
display lies within the useful field of view the data suggest
that initially sampling covertly is more efficient than
making eye movements for the same purpose. Indeed,
previous research has shown that search in the typical
conjunctive display can be at least as efficiently
accomplished without eye movements (Klein & Farrell,
1989; Zelinsky & Sheinberg, 1997). The novel contribution
of the current study is evidence that delaying eye
movements during a substantial free viewing time results in
more efficient subsequent oculomotor behavior, as indexed
by measures of RT by set size functions, number of
fixations, and the distance of the location of the last fixation
per trial from the location of the target object.
The results of these experiments suggest that top-down
knowledge acquired through the concurrent linguistic
presentation of the search target does not interact with the
initial acquisition of stimulus features of the search display.
It is possible that visual search requires an initial cognitive
representation of the search display before search can take
place. The gap effect reported by Watson and Humphreys
(1997) suggests that this process takes about 400 ms. Given
the substantial increase of search efficiency with the 750 ms
delay relative to the 350 ms delay, the data of Experiment 2
are consistent with this hypothesis. Specifically, top-down
processing may be limited to interacting with perceptual
processes until after enough bottom-up information has been
gathered.
In conclusion, increased efficiency in the Concurrent
(language) condition is likely not the result of two nested
feature searches. Rather it is a result of delaying the onset of
target-seeking saccades relative to the onset of the search
display. The first few saccades in the Concurrent condition
are limited to sampling the search display in preparation for
target-seeking saccades once the target is known. Thus,
more research is needed to clarify the role of linguistic
processing-based enhancement of perceptual processes.
