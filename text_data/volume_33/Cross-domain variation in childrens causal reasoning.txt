Abstract: How do children use covariation information to infer causation? In this series of studies, we consider how
the same 2 X 2 covariation pattern is interpreted by 4 and 6 year old children to explain a cause. In the first study,
two dolls played on two activities where their behavior covaried by doll or activity. Children were asked to explain
the cause of the dolls’ behavior and predict future behavior. In the second study, we presented the same covariation
data but instead framed it in terms of physical causality, i.e., the dolls were treated as physical objects that either
stuck or did not stick to the activities. Preliminary results reveal that children think differently about physical and
psychological causes, even with the same covariation pattern. Additionally, they appear to reason about probabilistic
data much more naturally in the psychological than the physical domain.
