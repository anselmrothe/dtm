Creativity, expertise and the questions people ask in engineering design
Ellen Campana
Arizona State University
Abstract: Finding a creative solution to a design problem (e.g. designing a device for taking water samples at
different depths) often depends on finding a fruitful representation of the problem space. For instance, a problem
space in which the device is assumed to be motor-driven might be less fruitful than one in which the mechanism for
motion is not specified or could be one of several possibilities. Designers&#700; representations of problem spaces
evolve as they work on individual problems. The questions they ask themselves (and sometimes each other) may
play a key role in the process. Do expert and novice designers ask similar questions? Do more creative and less
creative designers ask similar questions? How do expertise and creativity interact? I present preliminary results
from a think-aloud protocol study comparing novices (undergraduate engineering students) and experts (engineers
in industry). All participants also took a divergent thinking test to assess creativity.
