Abstract: In this article, we study the organization of emotions in memory supported by strategic processes. Three
hypotheses are tested. First, if emotions are structured in a n-dimension space, to which emotional characteristics
do these dimensions return. Second, is it possible to give an account of basic emotions through their organization
in memory. Third, can semantic relations give an account of emotional relations. Two word sorting experiments
are performed. In the first experiment, 128 pleasant and unpleasant words are divided into 8 lists. In the second
experiment, one positive and one negative 128 words list are each divided into 8 groups of 16 words. The results
support the hypothesis of an organization around a core affect (Russell, 2003), reinforce the existence of discrete
emotions (Johnson-Laird & Oatley, 1989), and confirm the predictive function of semantic relations accounted by
the Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer & Dumais, 1997) on the organization of emotions.
