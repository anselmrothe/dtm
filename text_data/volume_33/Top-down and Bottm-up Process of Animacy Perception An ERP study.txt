Abstract: We investigated neural mechanism for animacy perception by Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) during
reaching action. Participants were asked to observe an object, either of an animate thing (turtle) or an inanimate
thing (robot), which was veiled so that they had to judge only by its motions, not appearance, what it was. We
compared ERPs between the condition they felt it as animate and the condition they felt it as inanimate. We found
that ERPs in left infero-frontal region was significantly different between the two conditions. Next, we changed the
similarity of robot motion with turtle motion and compared ERPs. We found that ERPs in right occupito-temporal
region changed with robot motions. These results suggest that the attribution of animacy and the processing of
animate motion are related to the activation in left infero-frontal and right occupito-temporal region, respectively.
This implies that animacy perception consists of two neural mechanisms.
