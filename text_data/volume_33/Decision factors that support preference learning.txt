highly unexpected and this information would likely cause
you to drastically alter your beliefs about her preferences.
   We did not discuss the difference between expectations and
revised beliefs, but this principle is naturally captured using
the multinomial logit model by adjusting the priors assigned
to different utilities. We might assign a high prior to Alice’s
utility associated with cars, a low prior to her utility associ-
ated with bikes, and an even lower prior to her utility associ-
ated with pencils. In other words, although the model in this
paper is simple, it is flexible enough to handle many aspects
of preference learning and attribution that have interested re-
searchers for some time (Gilbert, 1998).
