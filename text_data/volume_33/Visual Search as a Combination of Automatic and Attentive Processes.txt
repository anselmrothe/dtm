   Participants B and C do not show modes as clearly as
does A, and these participants appear to have been reliably
guided to the correct location more often and sooner than
was the case for A.
Fitting the Model
   There are at most eleven freely estimated parameters per
participant used to fit sessions 34-44, seven of which are
associated with the comparisons to one display item in the
serial process (a few other other parameters were fixed
rather than estimated, as described below). The seven
comparison parameters, vT, vL, s, bT, bL, TER, and sT, were
estimated from the data for display size of one (i.e., the top
row of Figures 2A-2C). Fitting this way aligns with the
assumption that the serial comparison process is identical
for all items, regardless of the progress of the ongoing
search. It also provides a great deal of constraint on the
predictions of the model.
   With these parameter values fixed, we next estimated the
values of the residual time and switch time parameters,
tSWITCH and ΔTER. Finally we estimated parameters for the
parallel guidance process. To minimize the number of free
parameters required for this parallel process, we freely
estimate only one parameter, vPAR, used for all display sizes,
while the other parameters were fixed at values of bPAR = .1,
tPAR = .12 seconds and sPAR = 1.5 per second, for all three
participants.
   Finally, we fit three different versions of the model to
each participant – a version with only collapsing thresholds,
a version with only our early termination process, and a
version that included both of these processes. We found that
the early termination process alone worked reasonably well
for participants B and C, and that the collapsing thresholds
process was required for participant A, and show predictions

modeling, that A chose not to terminate search early. That
is, instead of an arbitrary early termination late in search, A
instead moved thresholds closer to the start point, so that the
search did end with some specified resolution. Participants
B and C terminated their search with a target absent
response on almost every trial in which they had not found a
target after two items had been scanned. One could argue
that this behavior was appropriate for these participants
because when the target was present they were reliably
guided to the target before having to scan more than two
items.
   It is probably obvious both that the model development
reported here was constrained and guided by the data and
that a number of alternative assumptions are plausible and
need to be tested. Such testing could and should be carried
out on the present data sets, on the additional data sets to
which the model has been applied but not reported in this
paper, and on response time distributions collected in new
studies designed to test particular assumptions. Nonetheless,
the application to the fitting of full response time
distributions is an excellent starting point, and has provided
new insights into the nature of visual search and its
component processes.
