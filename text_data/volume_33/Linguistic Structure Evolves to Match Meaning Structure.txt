Results
The results in Fig. 3 (left) indicate that the frequency of
frequency distributions in the initial, random languages have
good fits to power law regressions, with R2 values close to 1
(indicating that they are indeed random). As expected, these
values decrease as the languages are learned and reproduced
by successive participants (generations), suggesting that
they become more structured. In Fig. 3 (right) it is apparent
that the slopes of these regressions tend to flatten out in the
later generations, indicating as before that there are less n-       Figure 6. Z-scores of Comp values at each generation of the
