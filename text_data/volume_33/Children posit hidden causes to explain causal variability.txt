We sought to create such a scenario. Specifically, inhibitor-
based models predict that in some cases (such as the car ex-
ample above) adding failures to a string of instances, should
make it judged more likely that a success will occur subse-
quently. This is because the consistency of successes can al-
low us to infer the likely consistency of failures. Proportional
models, as we will see below, cannot match these predictions.
We will begin by describing the methods and results of the
experiment, before describing the models and model predic-
tions. We will then discuss the implications of these results
for models of causal reasoning.
