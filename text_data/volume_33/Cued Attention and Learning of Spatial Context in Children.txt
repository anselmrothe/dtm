                    Experiment 2
There is essentially no evidence of early contextual
cuing effects with children younger than five years old.
However, indirect evidence for such an influence of
learning on attention has been documented in toddlers’
learning, including noun generalization and category
formation (Berger & Aguerra, 2010; Jones, Smith &
Landau, 1991; Samuelson & Smith, 1998). Along with
a fairly strong effect observed in Experiment 1 with
children, developmental work suggests the potential
effect even in earlier points of development.
Experiment 2 tests preschool children to address this
question. We chose the age group of 3 to 5.5 years, the
