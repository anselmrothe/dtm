   Our hypothesis implies that those tasks that require selec-
tive processing on several concurrently maintained items in
working memory, impose an extra load on systems for spa-
tial encoding. This condition applies to a variety of tasks re-
ferred to as executive memory tasks or active memory tasks
which have been shown to engage SPL (as a region with spa-
tial encoding characteristics) (D’Esposito et al., 1998). More

delay period was ended with an audio signal.
   During the blocks of sorting task the signal was either a cue
for sorting (two thirds of trials) or for unsorted recall (one
third of trials). Because subjects did not know in advance
whether they would have to answer with the sorted or un-
sorted digit sequences, we reasoned that they would be forced
to wait until the end of the delay period – after the stimulus
had been long removed from the screen – before they started
any sorting.

   This result shows that unlike passive maintaining of ab-
stract items, during active processing, gaze shifts notably re-
spond to the orientation along which the memory items are
spatially associated. However, the significance of this re-
sult is related to demonstrating that the shifts in spatial at-
tention (measured by gaze shifts) are indeed independent
of the representation of memory items proposed by some
researchers(Wood et al., 2008; Dehaene & Cohen, 2007).
                        Experiment 2
In this experiment we tested whether string of digits that re-
quire different steps for sorting induce significantly different
gaze shift patterns. Our metric for difference in the sort-
ing procedures maps onto the cost of sorting using a generic
order-sensitive algorithm.

We hypothesized that sequences of items that can be sorted
with the same set of permutations call for similar algorith-
