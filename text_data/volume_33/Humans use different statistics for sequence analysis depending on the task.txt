This can be shown quantitatively by calculating the log like-
lihood values for the model fits. As Table 1 demonstrates, a
first-order model had a higher log likelihood, and so was the
preferred model.
Experiment 2
As in Experiment 1, the reaction time pattern for Experiment
2 was well-captured by a 1st-order model, as is shown in Fig-
ure 3 and Table 1. This suggests that subjects were mostly
using transition probabilities in order to predict the next ele-
ment in the sequence. However, the fit is not perfect. In par-
ticular, the peak of people’s RT pattern is not at AAAAB, cor-
responding to a violation of a perfectly repetitive pattern (as       Figure 3: RT data and best model fit for Experiment 2 (the

 Sequential effects demonstrate how humans can use the sta-

 scales. This work contributes to the literature attempting to
 understand how humans can achieve this, specifically in the
 case of tasks more complex than a simple 2AFC. Sequential
 effects are also intimately related to human pattern recogni-
