Abstract: The mechanisms that allow situated, embodied learning systems employed by human babies or juvenile
songbirds to distill their multimodal experience into a form that supports flexible and open-ended generation of
behavior are still poorly understood. We describe an ongoing attempt to gain insight into those mechanisms, by
developing a biologically motivated model capable of incremental unsupervised learning of a generative probabilistic
grammar of behavior, focusing initially on language. The implemented model demonstrates learning from unanno-
tated text corpora, including those of transcribed natural speech, while replicating the effect of variation sets on
learning, an effect documented in a recent study with human subjects.
