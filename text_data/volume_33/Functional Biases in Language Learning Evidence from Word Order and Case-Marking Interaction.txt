   As a simple test of our prediction, we explore the trade-off
between flexible word order and case-marking. We expose
different groups of participants to two artificial languages that
have flexible word order but differ in the presence of case-
marking on the object. If language learners indeed have a bias
against systemic ambiguity and case-marking is not avail-
able, word order should become a stronger cue to the intended
meaning.
