Abstract
Word learning in adults succeeds with the help of various
mechanisms and is based on multi-modal information sources.
The complex interplay of these different cues, however, has
rarely been studied. We present two experiments investigating how cross-situational word learning (CSWL) and learning
based on sentence-level constraints (SLCL) interact. Our results reveal that SLCL reduces the impact of CSWL when cues
are in conflict (Experiment 1) and even blocks statistical sensitivity when cues are independently applicable (Experiment
2). We suggest that the probabilistic nature of CSWL and the
more deterministic cues offered by SLCL may underlie this
behavior.
Keywords: Language learning; cross-situational word learning; sentence-level constraints;

Introduction
Disadvantaged as they may be in some respects, adult
language learners benefit from two natural characteristics.
Firstly, they are sensitive to the informativeness of various
kinds of available sources such as regularities regarding the
linguistic input and its context, the visual environment, and
social cues. Secondly, and more so than children, they can
constantly connect these multi-modal perceptions and cues
with their rich prior knowledge about both language structures and the world. Results from a number of studies reveal
that language novices track co-occurrences between unknown
spoken words and visual referents across situations (crosssituational word learning, CSWL, e.g., Quine, 1960; Yu and
Smith, 2007). Additionally, the linguistic context can constrain word meaning, for instance via the relation between a
verb and its arguments (e.g. subject and direct object): One
the one hand, the arguments define the rough semantic category of the verb (syntactic bootstrapping, Landau and Gleitman, 1985; Lee and Naigles, 2008); on the other hand, the
verb’s semantic restrictions can narrow down the category of
the direct-object noun learners need to consider (Koehne and
Crocker, 2010). Adults rapidly integrate their spontaneous
intuitions about plausible relations on-line, for example to anticipate objects (Altman and Kamide, 1999), and, as language
learners, frequently make use of inferencing strategies when
words are unknown (Field, 2004).
Only few studies have addressed the interplay of different
word-learning mechanisms relying on these kinds of multimodal cues. Gillette (1999) found that combined linguistic
context (verb frame and lexical information) and scene information can result in better verb learning than only one of
these cues. Koehne and Crocker (2010) present evidence for
the boost of CSWL by learning based on supporting sentence-

level constraints (SLCL), in particular the combination of verbal restrictions (of verbs such as to eat), visual scene, and
prior language-world knowledge. These studies still make
idealizations, however. Different cues are, firstly, fully in accordance with one another and, secondly, available simultaneously. In realistic learning scenarios, this is not necessarily the case: Learning cues are imperfect, information is frequently ambiguous and sometimes conflicting. It is therefore
important to examine how helpful different cues are when in
conflict, how they influence each other’s use, and which are
prioritized over others. Moreover, the moment in which potentially helpful sources are available is often not the same
moment in which this information can be used. While this
difficulty is rarely taken into account, one exception is the recent study by Arunachalam and Waxman (2010), which suggests that syntactic bootstrapping still works when verb information is not co-present with the visual referent.
Studying the different possible scenarios of interacting
learning mechanisms potentially also provides information
about the underlying nature of these mechanisms, an issue
that has rarely been discussed within the empirical wordlearning research (but see Yu and Ballard, 2007, Frank, Goodman, and Tenenbaum, 2009, and Alishahi and Fazly, 2010 for
formalizations based on computational models). To conduct
CSWL, it is necessary for learners to consider different mappings between unknown words and potential visual referents
in parallel. That means that this way of learning is non-direct
in that more than one hypothesis needs to be maintained,
at least until the first theoretically disambiguating situation.
There is some evidence that conducting CSWL works probabilistic and in parallel (Yurovsky, Fricker, Yu, and Smith,
2010). In particular, learners not only seem to store more
than one mapping between an unknown word on the one hand
and potential referents on the other hand, but are also sensitive to fine-grained differences in co-occurrence frequencies
(Vouloumanos, 2008). Gaze, gesture, or sentence-level constraints, on the contrary, potentially offer a more deterministic way of learning because these cues are often unambiguous
and therefore directly and immediately helpful. We therefore
expect such cues to be more reliable for the learner than crosssituational co-occurrence statistics. Furthermore, SLCL as
investigated by Koehne and Crocker (2010), additionally appears to exploit semantic category information (e.g. to eat
selects for objects of the category food).
Due to these differences in the nature of CSWL and SLCL,
we hypothesize that SLCL may modulate the use of CSWL
when both cues are in conflict (Experiment 1) or indepen-

dently applicable (Experiment 2). We further hypothesize
that SLCL still helps noun learning when restrictive verbs
and matching visual referents are not co-present, that is,
when verb information has to be used across trials (as in
Arunachalam and Waxman, 2010; Experiment 1). Finally,
we explore whether the nature of the emerging word meanings differ depending on learning strategy (Experiment 2):
We hypothesize that while CSWL users are sensitive to finegrained statistical differences in co-occurrences of unknown
words and potential referents, SLCL users are more likely to
associate category-based features of potential referents.

Participants 28 German native speakers took part in Experiment 1, four of which had to be excluded due to unsuccessful verb learning. Data from 24 learners was analyzed
(mean age 24, 20 females).
Design, Materials & Procedure The experiment sought to
teach participants a miniature semi-natural language (modified Indonesian) consisting of two restrictive verbs (’eat’,
’sew’), two non-restrictive verbs (’take’, ’point at’), twelve
nouns (’man’, ’woman’, ten object names), and the article si.
It comprised the following main stages: verb learning, nounlearning Block 1, Vocabulary Test 1, noun-learning Block 2,
Vocabulary Test 2, noun-learning Block 3, Vocabulary Test 3.
In Phase 1, participants familiarized themselves with the
four verbs. First, they watched action animations while hearing spoken verbs. Then, pictures of the four actions were
visible at the same time (the last position of the animations),
one verb was played, and participants were requested to click
onto the action matching the verb. Finally, animations were
presented silently and participants named the actions themselves. We were not interested in the process of verb acquisition itself but participant’s verb knowledge was a necessary
prerequisite to investigate the effect of verbal constraints on
noun learning.
In the three noun-learning phases, participants were exposed to pairs of static scenes and spoken subject-verb-object
(SVO) sentences (sentence start 1s after picture). Sentences
consisted of unknown nouns and the just-learned verbs (e.g.
Si laki tambamema si sonis, ’The man takes the SONIS’).
Scenes generally depicted inanimate objects (referents of the
nouns and distractors) as well as agent characters and some
background. Learners’ task was to understand the sentences
and learn the ten object names. There were 60 trials, each of
the ten novel nouns was presented six times.
Each noun, importantly, had two potential meanings (i.e.
referents). One of the two meanings for each noun was
supported by CSWL: The co-occurrence of the noun with
that object was 83% (high-frequency object, ’socks’ in Table 1). The other meaning was less supported by CSWL (cooccurrence only 50%, low-frequency object, ’corn’). Objects
other than the high-frequency object and the low-frequency
object, the distractors, all co-occurred only once with one

noun (=17% of the six presentations of the noun).
Additionally, each noun was in one of two conditions: In
Condition R(estrictive verb), it occurred with a restrictive
verb in half of the trials. In Condition N(on-restrictive verb),
it always occurred with a non-restrictive verb. In Condition
R, the meaning which was less supported by CSWL (lowfrequency object), however, was supported by SLCL, that is,
by the restrictive verb. That means that, while in Condition N,
there was one clearly supported meaning (the high-frequency
object), in Condition R, one meaning was supported by
CSWL (the high-frequency object), and one meaning was
supported by SLCL (the low-frequency object). Table 1 illustrates the way a noun (bintang) was presented in both conditions (i.e. with which verb and with which objects in the
scene): In three of six trials, both the high-frequency candidate and the low-frequency candidate were depicted, in two
trials the high-frequency candidate but not the low-frequency
candidate was visible, and in one trial neither appeared on
the scene. Importantly, in Condition R, restrictive verbs were
used only in that half of the trials in which the scene did not
include the low-frequency (= SLCL-supported) referent. That
means that restrictive verbs and referents matching the verb’s
semantic category were never co-present and verb information had to be memorized across adjacent trials. The presentation of trials was pseudo-randomized. Two object nouns
were presented in Block 1 (12 trials), four in Block 2 (24
trials), and four in Block 3 (24 trials). Pictures were counterbalanced regarding absolute and relative positions.
In the vocabulary-test phases, learners were presented all
20 objects depicted on the screen and heard one spoken noun
(10 trials). They were asked to click onto the referent that
they believed matched the noun. After decision, they indicated on a rating scale how confident they were about their

1931

choice (1(very unsure)-9(very sure)). The experiment lasted
about 40 minutes.

but independently applicable: That is, neither contrary as in
Experiment 1 nor complementary as in Koehne and Crocker
(2010) but redundantly co-present. Specifically, we aimed to
investigate the underlying mechanisms of CSWL and SLCL
(parallel vs. deterministic). Further, we examined whether
whether SLCL enhances learner’s sensitivity for category associations.

Predictions We expected learners to be able to use verb
information across trials, as demonstrated by the finding
of Arunachalam and Waxman (2010). Additionally, we
predicted a clear preference in Condition N for the highfrequency object to be selected in the vocabulary test. For
Condition R, however, we expected verb constraints to modulate cross-situational statistical learning, with more learners
preferring the low-frequency target than in Condition N.

Methods

Data Analysis, Results, & Discussion
Performance in noun learning (= learning either the lowfrequency or the high-frequency meaning) was clearly better than chance (10%): 87.5% for Condition N (t(23) =
24.665, p < .001), and 80.8% in Condition R (t(23) =
20.206, p < .001). Importantly, there was a main effect of
condition for the chosen meaning (χ(1) = 59.30, p < .001):
In Condition N, learners chose the high-frequency meaning 97% of the times and the low-frequency meaning only
3%. In Condition R, however, both meanings were chosen
about equally often (high-frequency candidate: 48%; lowfrequency candidate: 52%; see Figure 1). This also confirms
that learners were able to use verb information across trials.
The average confidence rating was 6.9 and there was no difference between conditions (6.8 in Condition N and 7.0 in
Condition R).

Figure 1: Chosen meanings Experiment 1
Learners’ decisions in the vocabulary test reveal a clear
difference of condition: While the high-frequency object was unambiguously favored in Condition N, both the
high-frequency object (supported by CSWL) and the lowfrequency object (supported by SLCL) were chosen equally
often in Condition R. This shows that SLCL (verbal constraints) CSWL (co-occurrence frequencies) had a very similar impact on vocabulary decision, with verb information
overriding cross-situational statistical information in 50% of
the cases. Further, our findings demonstrate how learners
make use of verbal restrictions across trials (in accordance
with the results of Arunachalam and Waxman, 2010).

Experiment 2
The goal of Experiment 2 was to further investigate the interplay of CSWL and SLCL when information is not in conflict

Participants 29 German native speakers took part in Experiment 2, five of which had to be excluded. Data from the
remaining 24 learners (19 females, mean age 24) was entered
into analyses.
Materials & Procedure The experimental materials and
procedure were similar to those in Experiment 1. The language comprised 18 nouns (the two character names and 16
object names), the same four verbs and the same article as in
Experiment 1.
The experiment consisted of the following phases: verblearn training, noun learning Block 1, Vocabulary Test 1,
noun learning Block 2, Vocabulary Test 2.
Participants were introduced into the experiment, verbs
were trained and tested exactly as in Experiment 1. Next,
learners were introduced into the noun-learning phase. Noun
learning consisted of 96 scene-sentence pairs, six presentations per object name. Each noun, again, had two potential meanings (=visual referents), one co-occurred with the
noun in 83% of the trials (high-frequency object) and one cooccurred in 50% of the trials (low-frequency object). Nouns
were also in one of two conditions: In Condition N(onrestrictive), they always occurred with a non-restrictive verb.
In Condition R(estrictive), they occurred with a restrictive
verb in 83% of their presentations (five of six trials). Importantly, in these restrictive trials, there was only one object depicted that matched the verbal restrictions. Unlike in
Experiment 1, CSWL (co-occurrence frequencies) and SLCL
(verb restrictions) in Condition R supported the same meaning: The high-frequency meaning was also supported by the
verb. That means that, in Condition R, there was a double cue
for learning the high-frequency meaning. There were always
four objects on the scene (and sometimes an agent character). Crucially, in three of six trials, both the high-frequency
object and the low-frequency object were depicted. In two of
six trials, the high-frequency object but not the low-frequency
object was included. In one of six trials, none of both referents was on the picture. Distractors, again, all co-occurred
only once with one noun (= 17%). The presentation of trials
was pseudo-randomized and pictures were counterbalanced
as in Experiment 1.
In the vocabulary test, learners heard a noun and were
asked to decide for one of four visual objects by clicking
on it. There were two different test types. In Test Type 1,
the high-frequency object, the low-frequency object, and two
distractors were depicted. In Test Type 2, the low-frequency
object, two distractors and a category associate (CA) were

1932

depicted. The category associate was an object which shared
the semantic category with the missing high-frequency object. Each forced choice was followed by a confidence rating,
as in Experiment 1. There were 24 test trials (12 per test type),
each object name was used twice, once in each test type, respectively. Eight object names each were trained and tested
in Block 1 and eight in Block 2.
Predictions We expected to find differences between conditions and test types. For Test Type 1, we predicted that
learners choose the high-frequency candidate more often than
the other objects in both conditions, however, with a clearer
dominance in Condition R than Condition N: While in Condition R both SLCL and CSWL support the high-frequency
meaning, in Condition N, only CSWL can be used. For test
trials of Test Type 2, we predicted a tendency for learners to
choose the low-frequency meaning in Condition N because
it is statistically the most plausible alternative to the highfrequency meaning and we hypothesized CSWL to work parallel. For Condition R, however we expected learners to not
differentiate between 50% and 17%. Instead we predicted
them to prefer the category associate: Learning nouns via verbal restrictions potentially motivates learners to be sensitive
to semantic categories and to consider category associates as
the best alternative to the high-frequency referent.

ject was picked reliably more often in Condition N than Condition R (Table 2, Rows 3-4) (see Figure 2). We also found
that confidence ratings were reliably higher in Condition R
(7.0) than Condition N (5.5; χ(1) = 31.01, p < .001).

Data Analysis, Results, & Discussion
Learning rates (= high-frequency candidate chosen in Test
Type 1) were significantly above chance (25%) for both conditions (N: t(23) = 7.995, p < .001; R: t(23) = 16.284, p <
.001).
More crucially, there were differences in the chosen meaning between conditions in both test types. For analyzing the
binomial data of test decisions (low-frequency object chosen
vs. high-frequency object chosen), we conducted logistic regressions by entering this binomial data into linear mixed effect models with logit link function (from the lme4 package
in R, Bates, 2005). Participant and Item were considered as
random factors. To see whether factor Condition had a main
effect on test decisions, we compared between the models
that include and exclude this factor with a Chi-Square test
(Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008). Contrasts between levels (Conditions N and R) were investigated by studying the
ratio of regression coefficients and standard errors since the pvalues produced by lmers (Wald z test) are anti-conservative
(Baayen et al., 2008): If the coefficient is greater than the
standard error times two, the comparison is considered to be
reliable. The formulas describing the lmer models are of the
following form: dependent variable (MeaningChoseb) is a
function of (∼) the independent variable (Condition) random
effects.
In Test Type 1 (high-frequency candidate and lowfrequency candidate present) the high-frequency object was
selected significantly more often in both conditions. However, it was chosen reliably more often in Condition R than in
Condition N (Table 2, Rows 1-2) and the low-frequency ob-

Coef.

Figure 3: Chosen meaning, Exp. 2, Test Type 2
For Test Type 2 (low-frequency object and category associate available), we also found a remarkable pattern: We
found significantly more category-associate (CA) decisions
in Condition R than Condition N (Table 3, Rows 1-2) and reliably more low-frequency choices in Condition N than Condition R (Table 3, Rows 3-4) (see Figure 3). To compare
whether both the category associate and the low-frequency
object were selected significantly more often than each other
object, we further conducted repeated measures ANOVAS
with Chosen Meaning (CA, low-frequency object, Distrac-

1933

tor 1, Distractor 2) as independent variable. We found
main effects for both conditions (N: F1 (3, 69) = 9.938, p <
.001; F2 (3, 45) = 9.018, p < .001; R: F1(3, 69) = 15.165, p <
.001; F2 (3, 45) = 22.132, p < .001). Pairwise comparisons reveal that, in Condition R, the category associate was selected
significantly more often then the three other objects (Table 4,
Rows 7-9) and the low-frequency candidate was not chosen
more frequently than the distractors (Table 4, Rows 10-12). In
Condition N, in contrast, both the category associate and the
low-frequency object were selected significantly more often
than the two distractors (Table 4, Rows 2-3 and 5-6) but the
difference between them was not significant (Table 4, Rows
1 and 4).

To summarize Experiment 2, we firstly found a clear sensitivity for differences in the co-occurrence rate of objects
and nouns (83% vs. 50% and 50% vs. 17%) in Condition N, which, in contrast, was completely blocked in Condition R. This suggests, firstly, that CSWL works in a parallel manner when it is the only mechanism used but, sec-

ondly, that sentence-level constraints reduced this sensitivity.
We attribute the blocking effect to the deterministic nature
of the verb cue: Since verb constraints offer a more direct
cue, learners relied on its information, ignoring fine-grained
co-occurrence relations. Moreover, decisions in trials of Test
Type 2 reveal that while learners were more likely to select
the category associate than the distractors in both conditions
(probably due to the obviousness of the two categories), the
difference between the number of category-associate choices
and the number of 50%-object choices was only significant
in Condition R. This suggests that sensitivity for category associations was enhanced by SLCL. Finally, the difference in
confidence ratings in Test Type 1 between conditions reveals
that learners were more confident when sentence-level constraints were available than when only statistical information
could be used.

Summary & General Discussion
Results from the two language-learning experiments presented in this paper shed light on the complex interplay
of two word-learning mechanisms: Cross-situational word
learning (CSWL) and learning based on sentence-level constraints SLCL. Our findings reveal, firstly, that when SLCL
and CSWL are in conflict, they have a similar impact on word
learning (Experiment 1). Secondly, we found that CSWLlearners are sensitive to small differences in co-occurrence
frequencies; however, SLCL clearly blocks this sensitivity
when CSWL and SLCL are independently available (Experiment 2). These results about the way CSWL and SLCL interact further allow us to draw conclusions about the underlying nature of both mechanisms: While CSWL offers incremental, probabilistic, and parallel learning, SLCL works in a
more deterministic manner. Finally, Experiment 2 provides
initial evidence that SLCL leads learners to associate semantic categories with novel nouns, more so than CSWL. This
suggests that the two mechanisms result in qualitatively different representations of an emerging word meaning: CSWL
yields a set of probabilistically weighted word-meaning mappings, while SLCL associates (presumably verb-derived) semantic features with novel words.
