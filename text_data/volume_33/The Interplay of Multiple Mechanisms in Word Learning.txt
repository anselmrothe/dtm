depicted. The category associate was an object which shared
the semantic category with the missing high-frequency ob-
ject. Each forced choice was followed by a confidence rating,
as in Experiment 1. There were 24 test trials (12 per test type),
each object name was used twice, once in each test type, re-
spectively. Eight object names each were trained and tested
in Block 1 and eight in Block 2.
Predictions We expected to find differences between con-
ditions and test types. For Test Type 1, we predicted that

   More crucially, there were differences in the chosen mean-
ing between conditions in both test types. For analyzing the
binomial data of test decisions (low-frequency object chosen
vs. high-frequency object chosen), we conducted logistic re-
gressions by entering this binomial data into linear mixed ef-
fect models with logit link function (from the lme4 package
in R, Bates, 2005). Participant and Item were considered as
random factors. To see whether factor Condition had a main
effect on test decisions, we compared between the models
that include and exclude this factor with a Chi-Square test
(Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008). Contrasts between lev-
els (Conditions N and R) were investigated by studying the
ratio of regression coefficients and standard errors since the p-
values produced by lmers (Wald z test) are anti-conservative                  Figure 3: Chosen meaning, Exp. 2, Test Type 2
