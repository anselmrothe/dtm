   The results suggested that participants in different CMC
conditions probably allocated time differently depending on
task difficulty and level of conflict. Participants using text
and audio chatting had a tendency of spending more time
when it was harder to find solution candidates, whereas
participants in video condition were more likely to spend
more time when more conflicts need to be resolved.
