such systems do not have to be innate as suggested in ear-
lier research. Building on a place-coding system with lin-
ear scaling and constant variability as the core representation
of numerosity, Verguts et al. (2005) shifted the responsibility
for size and distance effects from number representation to
later processing stages. It was demonstrated that this leads
to results consistent with experimental data. These are char-
acterized by symmetrical priming patterns and no size effect
in naming and parity tasks, combined with the presence of
both size and distance effects in the comparison task. This
