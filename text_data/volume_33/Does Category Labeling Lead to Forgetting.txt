tures of each object. In contrast, it seems likely that
preference judgements might result in deeper consider-
ation of the idiosyncratic features of an objects (e.g.,
“Would this chair match my desk? Would I like to sit
on it?”), something Lupyan acknowledged in his origi-
nal report. Consistent with this view, Lupyan (2008)
found that response times were typically longer for pref-
erence judgments than for labeling trials, indicating that
participants may have been processing the items more
deeply. In addition, numerous studies have demon-
strated a memory advantage for encoding items in re-
lation to the self (see Symons & Johnson, 1997 for a
review).
   The goal of the present study is to further explore the
impact that categorization or labeling has on memory
