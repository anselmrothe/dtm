Abstract: Vector symbolic architectures (VSAs), such as holographic reduced representations (HRRs), can be
understood as schemes for representing knowledge and implementing symbol manipulation in connectionist architectures. We characterize VSAs in terms of five basic operators: similarity, superposition, binding, unbinding, and
permutation. We compare the different VSAs in the literature on space and time complexity and unbinding accuracy,
and on qualitative differences in how their operators function. We find that binary spatter codes, and real-valued
and frequency-domain HRRs compare favourably to other types of VSA. We discuss the advantages of VSAs over
traditional connectionist and symbolic approaches. VSAs retain the expressive power of symbolic approaches with
the added benefit of being lossy representations. The lossy nature of VSAs makes them easily scalable to large
problems and suited to modelling biological memory. Whether VSAs can be applied to problem domains that cannot
be trivially discretized into symbols remains an open question.
