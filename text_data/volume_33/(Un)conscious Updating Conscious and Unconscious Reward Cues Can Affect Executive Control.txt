Abstract: The present study investigates whether updating, an important function of executive control, can be
driven by unconscious reward cues. Participants had to memorize several numbers and update those numbers
independently according to a sequence of arithmetic operations. At the beginning of each trial, a reward (1 euro or
5 cents) was presented, either subliminally or supraliminally. Participants could earn the reward if they found the
correct response on the updating task. Results showed better performance when a high (conscious or unconscious)
reward was at sake compared to a low reward. This suggests that subliminal information can influence a component
process of executive control traditionally thought to require consciousness.
