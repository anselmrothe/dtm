   Conjunctive causes are causes that all need to be present for an
   effect to occur. They contrast with independent causes that by
   themselves can each bring about an effect. We extend existing
   “causal power” representations of independent causes to in-
   clude a representation of conjunctive causes. We then demon-
   strate how independent vs. conjunctive representations imply
   sharply different patterns of reasoning (e.g., explaining away                                 Figure 1.

  example, subjects who learned Romanian Rogos (a type of
  automobile) were told that Rogos have a number of typical

  fuel filter gasket, hot engine temperature, etc). In addition,
  subjects were instructed on the interfeature causal relations
