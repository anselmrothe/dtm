specifically, speakers were more likely to include ‘colour’
when there was high variation in the picture grid (M = .24,

  This first experiment confirmed our hypothesis about the
role of scene variation on speakers’ tendencies to include
redundant attributes in their target descriptions. In the next
experiment, we will see whether the same applies when the
difference between the low and high variation conditions
gets more subtle.
