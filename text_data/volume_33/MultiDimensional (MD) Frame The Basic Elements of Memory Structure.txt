Abstract: Object cognition occurs as follows: collecting information from the environment via perceptual sensors;
integrating and segmenting the collected information, centering on visually collected objects; and continuing these
processes until the necessary objects to live in the environment are obtained. These objects are then used indepen-
dently in Systems 1 and 2 of Two Minds, and memorized after integrating related entities associated with each system.
Due to the limitation of the brainâ€™s processing capability, the range of integration is limited; therefore, System 1
memory and System 2 memory may differ. However, they may share objects originating from perceptual sensors.
Thus, when objects that are the result of the just-finished integration and segmentation process are processed in
the next cycle, representation of the objects may serve as the common elements to combine System 1 memory and
System 2 memory to form an intersystem memory. We call this memory the MultiDimensional (MD) Frame.
