We identified repeat and switch thresholds for every partici-
pant as in Experiment 1. The average repeat threshold was
0.90 (SD = 0.03, median = 0.91) and the average switch
threshold was 0.86 (SD = 0.07, median = 0.87). The dif-
ference is reliable via a paired t-test [t(34) = 2.94, p < .01]
and via Wilcoxon test [p < .01]. Thus, comparably to the first
two experiments, classification was easier in the repeat con-
text compared to switch. In turn, this implies greater facility
in discriminating repeat-biased than switch-biased matrices
from random ones.
   At the same time, both the repeat and the switch thresh-
olds were reliably higher than those in Experiment 1 (.90 vs.
.85 and .86 vs. .82; t > 2.73, p < .01 in both cases). The
difference between the two experiments, however, might be
due to the greater number of trials in the present setting (200
vs. 100). If thresholds are calculated using the just the first
hundred trials of Experiment 3, they are the same as in Ex-
periment 1 (.85 for repeat and .82 for switch).                                  Figure 3: Sample trial in Experiment 4.
