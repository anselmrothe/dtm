Comparing the efficacy of bigrams and frames in cuing lexical
categories for human learners
Toben Mintz
University of Southern California
Abstract: Distributional patterns in linear word sequences are informative about lexical categories in natural
languages. However, it is unclear what patterns human learners use to categorize words. The current study exposed
adults to sentences in two artificial languages. The Frames group heard sentences in which target words were
embedded in frequent frames (FFs)—frequently co-occurring words that immediately surrounded/framed a target
word (e.g., you X it); the FFs categorized the target words into two distinct categories. The Bigrams-Only group
heard sentences with the same vocabulary, but no FFs. However, the bigram information in the two languages
was equally informative regarding the categories of target words. In a 2AFC test, Frames subjects but not the
Bigrams-Only subjects chose novel sentences that contained target words as ”correct” if they adhered to the abstract
distributional structure, compared to ”ungrammatical” sentences that were identical on all surface dimensions. Thus,
learners categorized using FFs but not bigrams alone.
