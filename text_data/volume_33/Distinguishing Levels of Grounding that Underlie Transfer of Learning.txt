participants were excluded from analysis for failure to

Materials and Design The materials in this study were
based on the materials used in Day and Goldstone (in press).
The training simulation in that original study depicted a
horizontally oscillating ball suspended between elastic
bands, and a rightward-pointing fan that could supply a
constant horizontal force. The simulation included neither
gravity nor friction, so the system yielded perpetual
oscillatory motion of the ball when the fan was not being
used. Participants clicked on the fan to get the ball to a
particular position, such as “maximizing” the ball’s position
by getting it to the far endpoint. Consistently applying the                Figure 1a & 1b: Compatible (top) and Incompatible

action incompatibility may sometimes help, by effectively
