Figure 4. Simulations of number learning in which object Features predict Labels (FL-learning; left panel), and in which Labels predict Features (LF-
learning; right panel). The models learned to associate sets of two, four and six objects to the labels “2,” “4” and “6.” In addition to number, each object set
had size, shape and color cues that competed as cues with set-size as predictors of number words. These graphs depict the value of mappings between the
object features, set-sizes and the label “6” learned in each simulation. As can be seen, FL-learning resulted in considerably greater discrimination of the
appropriate cue-label mapping (set-size six to “6”) than LF-learning, where competing activations continued to cause interference.
