   Some of the prior work examining probabilistic
environments has looked at validity assessment. For
example, Droll, Abbey & Eckstein (2009) asked
participants to estimate the validity of a cue in terms of
predicting the presence of a target. They found that
participants slightly overestimated the validity of poor
predictors (those that predicted the target on about 10% of
trials) and slightly underestimated the better predictors
(those that were predictive of target on 60% of trials). In
the present study, we are interested to see how people
