Abstract: Multiple primate species have demonstrated a propensity for serial order learning that qualitatively
differs from many tested non-primates. The interaction between physiology, sociality and cognition evinces the need to
examine this ability throughout the primate order and across different stages of performance. Zoo-living gorillas (n=3)
and chimpanzees (n=3) learned to order progressively-built lists of 3,4, and 5 symbols on a touchscreen computer.
While performance increased on longer lists for both species (F=20.1, p<0.001), overall gorillas performed more
accurately (F=149.1, p<0.001) and exhibited longer response latencies (F=89.2, p<0.001) compared to chimpanzees.
Task errors most frequently comprised selection of the symbol associated with the next ordinal position (F=124.3,
p<0.001). Results support an ape-typical learning process, while performance differences may indicate the influence
of species-traits impacting attention, arousal, and impulsivity.
