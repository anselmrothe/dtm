Abstract
A small number of the logically possible word order configurations account for a large proportion of actual human languages.
To explain this distribution, typologists often invoke principles
of human cognition which might make certain orders easier or
harder to learn or use. We present a novel method for carrying out very large scale artificial language learning tasks over
the internet, which allows us to test large batteries of systematically designed languages for differential learnability. An exploratory study of the learnability of all possible configurations
of subject, verb, and object finds that the two most frequent
orders in human languages are the most easily learned, and
yields suggestive evidence compatible with other typological
and psycholinguistic observations.

Language typology and cognitive universals
Although human languages could in principle place their
meaningful elements in any conceivable order, certain patterns crop up much more frequently than would be expected
by chance even in unrelated languages. Just taking the order
of the three principal sentence components subject, verb and
object, there are six possible orders, but the dominant order in
over 85% of the world’s languages is either SOV or SVO. The
table below shows the typological distribution in a sample of
402 languages surveyed by Tomlin (1986).1

Researchers in language typology have often hypothesized
that properties of the human cognitive system could account
for these patterns. For example, the fact that the three most
frequent word orders are SOV, SVO and VSO can be explained by the cognitive prominence of agentive, animate, or
topical referents, and therefore a bias to mention subjects first.
However, comparatively little work has directly used behavioral results to test or build on these typological theories
We thank Masha Fedzechkina for technical assistance, and Cassandra Jacobs and Andrew Wood for their work creating stimuli.
1 More recent work has suggested that language counts may skew
the true distribution by not accounting for relatedness of languages
(e.g. Dryer 2009), but this approximate ranking is uncontroversial.

(Jaeger & Tily, 2011, for discussion). This is partly because
languages differ in many respects, so any difference in a behavioral measure taken from speakers of two languages might
have any number of underlying causes. Probably the most
productive behavioral research has been enabled by an observation Hawkins (2004) calls the Performance-Grammar Correspondence Hypothesis. Roughly, this holds that the same
cognitive principles influence both speakers’ choices between
variant forms within a language, and the processes of language change which lead a language to hard-code a certain
order into its grammar. This allows us to link behavioral effects within a language to cross-linguistic typological trends.
For instance, Hawkins shows that English speakers’ choices
between multiple possible orders such as those in (1) can be
explained by a preference to keep as close as possible the verb
and the head word of each of its arguments (here the prepositions shown in bold).2
(1) a. the woman waited [for her son] [in the cold but not unpleasant wind]
b. the woman waited [in the cold but not unpleasant wind]
[for her son]
A similar effect is well documented in behavioral studies of
comprehension difficulty (Gibson, 2000). Hawkins’ principle can explain Greenberg’s (1963) observation that VO languages tend to have prepositions while OV languages have
postpositions. The opposite order would result in longer distances between the verb and adpositions, on average.
Similarly, work by Branigan and colleagues (e.g. Branigan et al., 2008) has shown that in languages like Greek and
Japanese with variable SO/OS order, participants in memory
tasks often “correct” the OS sentences they previously heard
to SO order when recalling them. The greater “conceptual
accessibility” of agents results in a preference for SO order
for speakers of languages with both SO and OS, and may be
the reason for the infrequency of primarily OS languages discussed previously.
An alternative way to apply behavioral data to explaining typological distributions is to eschew natural languages,

Hawkins’ theory, but this detail does not apply in our examples.

and teach participants constructed languages with the desired
properties. Recent work in the artificial grammar paradigm
has begun to investigate whether typological patterns can be
reproduced in patterns of learnability (see Christiansen 2000;
Finley & Badecker 1998; Culbertson & Smolensky 2011).
Fedzechkina, Jaeger and Newport (2011) have additionally
started to look for a communicative explanation for such biases, showing greater preservation of case systems in artificial
languages which would otherwise contain ambiguity.
We present results using an artificial grammar paradigm
to explore the most widely discussed typological finding, the
distribution of dominant basic word orders. Using artificial
language lets us test all six possible orders on an equal footing. We introduce a novel web-based paradigm that allows
us to conduct experiments with hundreds or potentially thousands of participants in a short time, making possible designs with a large number of conditions. Experiment 1 introduces and tests this new software system, while Experiment 2
presents our first results from a word order experiment using
it. Our results suggest that constructed languages with certain
basic word orders are learned or used less easily than others.

Experiment 1: Probability matching
Experiment 1 was designed to evaluate a novel methodology for conducting language-learning experiments with large
numbers of participants over the web. We use a custom-made
Adobe Flash applet developed by the first author (see Figure
1). This applet is capable of displaying audio and video stimuli, and recording the user’s responses to various types of test
trials. Participants were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk (http://mturk.com), an online service where users are
paid to perform simple tasks.
We attempted to replicate the well-known phenomenon of
probability matching, the tendency for adult learners given
inconsistent input to replicate the frequency with which they
observe different forms. We followed an experiment reported
by Hudson Kam and Newport (2005) which varied the frequency with which nouns in a constructed language were
heard with a “determiner” word. In subsequent production
tasks, participants produced those determiners with roughly
the same frequency.
In Hudson Kam and Newport’s language, each noun was
associated with one of two possible determiners, and a second
manipulation varied whether those classes were an arbitrary
division of nouns or were semantically based (a mass/count
division). We varied a similar semantic variable, the natural
gender consistency of our determiners. In half the conditions,
the two noun classes corresponding to our two determiners
separated the male characters from the females. In the other
conditions, each class contained both males and females.

nouns). The seventh language had no determiners. Each language contained intransitive sentences, with the word order
SV (subject-verb) and transitive, with order SOV (subjectobject-verb).3 Where determiners were present, they preceded the nouns. Thus transitive sentences all followed the
template (det) subject-noun (det) object-noun verb.
Meanings were supplied by short videos showing human
characters performing actions. The videos were rendered in
3D using the EFrontier’s Poser software package. There were
three female characters (hippie, nurse, cheerleader) and three
males (mechanic, conductor, cop). There were also 2 inanimates (flower, apple). In both the arbitrary and gender determiner conditions, one inanimate was assigned randomly
to each class. Each animate was rendered performing each
of two intransitive actions (crouch, jump), and as the agent
of each of four transitive actions (pull, pick up, carry, kick),
with each of the other 7 characters/objects as the patient. This
yielded 12 intransitive and 168 transitive videos.
Sounds were recorded as individual words, and sentences
were created by concatenation. We created a pool of 6 possible monosyllabic words for use as determiners, and 29 monoto trisyllabic content words. Each participant saw a different
random assignment of words to meanings, by sampling 2 of
the 6 possible determiners and 14 of the 29 possible content
words for the 8 nouns and 6 verbs.

Procedure

Design and materials

Participants were recruited via Mechanical Turk and paid
$0.75 or $1.00 USD. A total of 134 people took part. All were
located in the USA and self-reported native English speakers.
Participants were randomly assigned to conditions.
Participants received instructions throughout the task from
an on-screen cartoon character who told them they would
learn an “alien language”. In block 1 (noun learning), they
saw the 12 intransitive scenes, each accompanied by the

We tested 7 language types. Six were constructed by crossing the type of determiner (natural gender vs arbitrary) with
the frequency of determiner use (one third vs two thirds vs all

corresponding sentence in their language via audio and orthographic transcription. After seeing all 12, participants
completed 6 forced-choice tasks, where they heard a sentence while watching two previously seen videos of different
characters performing the same action played simultaneously
side-by-side. Participants clicked on one video to indicate
which corresponded to the sentence. Participants who failed
to get all 6 correct received feedback and were returned to the
beginning of the experiment to try again.
In block 2 (action learning), participants saw 12 transitive
actions, 6 with each of two randomly selected verbs, accompanied by audio and transcription. Afterwards, 4 more forced
choice trials were shown using previously unseen scenes with
these two verbs. Each pair of videos differed in only their
verb, subject, or object. Participants received performance
feedback (number of correct trials), but continued regardless
of performance.
Block 3 (action learning 2) introduced the remaining 2
transitive verbs in the same way as block 2. Afterwards, there
were 8 forced choice trials like the previous ones, with each
of the 4 transitive verbs being used as the correct video twice.
In the 1/3 and 2/3 determiner conditions, nouns were chosen at random to be given determiners, but each of the three
learning blocks was constrained to contain the appropriate
proportion overall.
In block 4 (production), participants were instructed to
“speak” the language they had learned. On each of 15 trials, a
previously unseen transitive action video was played without
any sound. Above the video was a written vocabulary list of
words from the language. Participants constructed a sentence
by clicking on words one at a time, and could hear their sentence by clicking a “play” button, or click on a “reset” button
to start again. They were told to click on a “continue” button when their sentence was an appropriate description of the
video. Videos in this block had two animate participants.

are correct under this measure if they contain the correct verb
and the two correct nouns, in any order and with or without any determiners. There was no effect of determiner type
(p = .78), but correctness differed with input frequency (main
effect: p = .03, interaction: p = .11). This was clearly driven
by high performance in the 1/3-gender condition (77%, compared with 47-63% in the other 5 conditions. This pattern
is unexpected, and we assume it is due to chance. In the no
determiner condition, 39% of trials had the correct words.
Next we calculated word order correctness. Sentences are
considered correct if their verb, subject and object are in the
expected order, SOV. We excluded trials which did not have
the correct words. Performance is close to ceiling in all conditions (grand mean 89%), showing that when participants
get the words right, they almost always use them in the correct order. There was a significant effect of determiner type
(p < .001) such that natural gender conditions were correct
more than arbitrary conditions (92 vs 85%). There was an effect of input frequency (p < .001) with performance increasing with greater input frequency (83, 92 and 94%). There
was no significant interaction (p = .95). In the no determiner
condition, performance was 87%.

Figure 2 shows determiner presence. This is the proportion
of nouns produced by a participant that are preceded by any
determiner. There is an obvious effect of input frequency such
that participants who saw more determiners in the input produce proportionally more themselves (main effect: p < .001)
but no effect of determiner type (main effect: p = .11; interaction: p = .13).

Results
Two types of behavioral data were collected: the forced
choice discrimination tasks seen after blocks 2 and 3, which
were combined in the analysis, and the production trials. Data
was analyzed using multilevel logistic regression (Jaeger,
2008) with maximal random effects for participant, verb,
subject, and object, except where there were too many subjects with ceiling performance to fit such a model, where we
fell back on weighted empirical logit regression over subject
means (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989). We excluded the nodeterminer condition from these analyses to yield a crossed
design. We report p values for chi-square model comparison
tests associated with the predictors of interest.
Discrimination performance was high in all conditions.
Natural gender determiner classes lead to slightly higher performance (93 vs 87%, p = .01) but there is no effect of input
frequency (main effect: p = .91, interaction:p = .13). In the
no determiner condition, 91% of trials were correct.
Multiple measures were calculated from the production trials. First, we calculated vocabulary correctness: sentences

frequency (main effect: p = .89; interaction: p = .73).

Discussion
Judging from the discrimination, vocab, and order correctness
measures, our participants learn the languages well. They
perform close to ceiling in comprehension, and produce fully
correct sentences about half the time. Sentences produced
with the correct words are almost always in the correct order.
In production, participants produce determiners with frequency depending on their frequency in the input: 19% in the
1/3 of nouns, 58% in the 2/3 of nouns, and 93% in the all
nouns conditions. The production frequency of determiners
is always slightly lower than the frequency seen in training.
This mirrors the results of Hudson Kam and Newport (2005):
there, input frequencies of 45, 60, 75 & 100% yielded production frequencies of roughly 30, 45, 65 & 100% respectively.
Hudson Kam and Newport’s noun class manipulation had
no significant effect on production frequency. Similarly, our
manipulation of arbitrary versus natural gender classes has
no significant effect on production frequency. However, we
found a novel result in that determiner class correctness was
greater when the classes corresponded to natural genders. Although the interaction with frequency is not significant, the
determiner type effect is smallest in the condition where all
nouns in the input had determiners. This might suggest that
natural semantic classes are easier to learn with limited exposure but that this effect diminishes with more input.
In conclusion, these results confirm the utility of our
web-based language learning method for conducting artificial grammar experiments. Participants were able to learn
and use the languages they were taught, and their behavior
with respect to inconsistent input closely matches that previously reported for participants learning larger languages over
several days in the lab. Extending previous work, we also
find evidence that word classes that map onto natural semantic classes are learned better than arbitrary classes.

Experiment 2: Word order variation
Experiment 2 was constructed to test the hypothesis that different basic word orders are observed with different frequencies among the world’s languages because some orders are

more naturally acquired or used than others. We chose to manipulate the order of the basic constituents S, O and V. Our
experiment was intended to determine whether SO languages
are more easily learned than OS languages. As discussed earlier, the vast majority of natural languages are SO, and one explanation is a universal cognitive preference to place (salient,
agentive) subjects before objects. By testing all 6 possible
word orders, we can also check our results for a more general relationship between the learnability of each order and
its relative typological frequency.
As a secondary manipulation, we also varied determinernoun order. There is a typological tendency for VO languages
to have determiners which precede the noun, while OV languages more often have determiners which follow the noun
(Dryer, 1989).4 If this correlation emerges from a deeper cognitive property, we might observe differences in the learnability of pre- vs postnominal determiner languages depending on
their VO/OV order.

Design and materials
We used exactly the same stimuli as in Experiment 1, but
with different languages. This time, determiners appeared
with all nouns in all languages, and the two determiner classes
were assigned as in the natural gender consistent conditions
of Experiment 1. We introduced two new fully crossed manipulations. Each language used one of the six possible basic word orders (SOV, SVO, VSO, OSV, OVS, VOS), and
each had either prenominal or postnominal determiners (DetN vs N-Det). This gives a 6*2 design, of which one cell
(SOV/prenominal) was identical to the gender/all nouns condition in Experiment 1.

Procedure
The procedure was identical to that of Experiment 1. 285
participants took part, and were paid $0.75. All were located
in the USA and were self-reported native English speakers.

Results
The data was analyzed in the same way as Experiment 1.
Figure 4 shows performance on the transitive verb forced
choice discrimination trials. Performance on SOV and SVO
conditions (94 and 92%) is comparable to the 93% correctness levels seen in natural gender conditions in Experiment
1. However, performance is slightly lower on the other orders
VSO, OSV, OVS and VOS (86, 89, 87 and 85% respectively).
This word order difference is marginally significant (p = .06),
and there is a significant effect of determiner order such that
prenominal conditions are more accurate (91 vs 87%) but no
interaction (p = .83).
4 Real languages differ in whether the various determiner-like
functions (e.g. definiteness determination of articles, deictic function of demonstratives) are associated with single or different word
categories, and those different functions may be associated with different ordering tendencies. Since our “determiners” are semantically and functionally empty, we necessarily rely on crude typological generalizations.

Because we were primarily interested in the effect of determiner order with respect to its interaction with VO order, we
ran a separate model collapsing together all VO languages
and all OV languages. This time, the interaction between
word order and determiner order was significant (p = .02).
This was carried by an advantage for prenominal determiners in VO orders (36 vs 51%) while there was little difference
within OV orders (48 vs 47%).
Figure 6 shows word order correctness of the three principal constituents. 100% of trials in the SVO conditions (357
total) were produced in the correct order. SOV shows almost

Discussion
When interpreting the results of Experiment 2, it must be remembered that our participants may have a native language
bias towards English-like languages. Indeed, vocabulary correctness is highest in the SVO/prenominal condition, and the
only two conditions with 100% accuracy on the order correctness score are the SVO conditions. Order correctness might
generally be higher in languages where elements are positioned as in English: the orders where none of the three are in
the English position (OSV and VOS) yield the poorest performance. However, there are many other ways a hypothetical
native bias could be formulated which do not predict performance. For instance, neither containing English substrings
(SV or VO) nor having V-O order are predictive. There is no
obvious native language explanation for the high performance
on SOV, which is second only to SVO on all both production
measures (vocabulary and order) and above SVO in forced
choice comprehension. SVO and SOV do have in common
a subject which precedes the object, as it does in over 90%
of natural languages. This could indicate greater cognitive
ease of learning or using languages with SO order. Accordingly, VSO scores third after SVO and SOV in terms of order correctness. In contrast though, in comprehension and in
production vocabulary correctness, VSO has the lowest performance of all. Tentatively, then, we suggest that the production task favors SO orders due to a cognitive bias to prefer
agents before patients. We do not find any evidence that this
bias affects the learning or choice of the words themselves,
nor the comprehension of learned languages.
High SOV performance is interesting in light of both the
typological frequency of SOV (Dryer (2009) suggests SOV
may be twice as frequent as SVO if genera are counted rather
than individual languages), and recent work showing SOV advantages. Based on findings from varied paradigms, GoldinMeadow and colleagues (e.g. Goldin-Meadow, Özyürek &

1368

Mylander, 2008) have argued that SOV is in some sense a
cognitively “basic” order for the representation of events:
speakers of all languages fall back on SOV in nonlinguistic expression tasks, and emergent sign languages tend to be
SOV. Our results can be taken to support this finding, in that
participants produce SOV order more accurately than any order besides that of their native language. Moreover, in the
comprehension task, SOV performance was in fact slightly
above SVO. Thus any SOV advantage is not restricted to production.
A second possible effect that emerges is that of verb mediality. Among the SO orders, there is an SVO advantage
on all three measures, which can be explained as native language bias. But among the OS orders too, there is an OVS
advantage on the two production measures, and no differences in the comprehension measure. OVS is typologically
very rare. However, the psycholinguistic theories of Hawkins
and Gibson mentioned in the introduction predict that OVS
should be relatively easy to process, since both arguments of
the verb are adjacent to it. Gibson, Brink, Piantadosi & Saxe
(2011) have suggested that SVO approaches the typological
frequency of cognitively basic SOV order because it separates
the subject and object, which are similar and therefore confusable. They show that an SOV bias observed in a task with
inanimate patients switches to SVO when both agent and patient are animate, as is the case in our materials. Similarly,
one explanation for the verb-medial effect here is that adjacent similar noun phrases impede learning or use.
The evidence for determiner order on learnability is mixed.
Prenominal determiners led to slightly higher comprehension
accuracy, which may simply reflect the familiarity of prenominal determiners to English speaking participants. There was
no effect of determiner order on production order correctness, but in vocabulary correctness prenominals led to better
performance in VO orders only. It is possible that the main
effect of native language obscured potentially more interesting results. Prenominal determiners are favored in the VO
conditions, where the native language order and the typological correlation between VO order and determiner order are
in alignment. For the OV languages, where those two factors
act against each other, there is no difference in correctness.
In future research, we hope to explore this question further
using pre/postpositions, which have stronger typological tendencies, and with native speakers of OV languages.

Conclusions
We have shown that a web-based language learning task can
be used effectively to study the learnability of languages. As
expected, English speakers perform well on English-like languages, but they also perform extremely well on SOV languages. This is compatible with previous claims that SO orders — and perhaps SOV specifically — are favored by a
default cognitive bias. The internet-based methodology presented here allows an unprecedented amount of data to be
collected, allowing for the testing of more and more detailed

artificial languages, and using participants with different native language backgrounds. We hope this paradigm will bring
new behavioral evidence to the study of language typology.
