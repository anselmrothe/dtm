and teach participants constructed languages with the desired
properties. Recent work in the artificial grammar paradigm
has begun to investigate whether typological patterns can be
reproduced in patterns of learnability (see Christiansen 2000;
Finley & Badecker 1998; Culbertson & Smolensky 2011).
Fedzechkina, Jaeger and Newport (2011) have additionally
started to look for a communicative explanation for such bi-
ases, showing greater preservation of case systems in artificial
languages which would otherwise contain ambiguity.
    We present results using an artificial grammar paradigm
to explore the most widely discussed typological finding, the
distribution of dominant basic word orders. Using artificial
language lets us test all six possible orders on an equal foot-
ing. We introduce a novel web-based paradigm that allows             Figure 1: Screenshot during a learning trial (the nurse kicks
