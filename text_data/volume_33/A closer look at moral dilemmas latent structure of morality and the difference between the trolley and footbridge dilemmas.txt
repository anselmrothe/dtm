Abstract
Although moral dilemmas such as the trolley and footbridge
dilemmas (Thomson, 1986) have been widely employed to
investigate the nature of moral reasoning, but their
psychometric properties remain a mystery. In this study, 219
participants completed 62 moral dilemma tasks used in
Greene et al. (2001), and the correlation structure among the
dilemmas was analyzed through factor analysis and structural
equation modeling. The results show the following two points.
First, the moral-personal dilemma tasks studied are composed
of one factor, indicating that the assumption in Greene et al.
(2001) was supported. Second, the trolley and footbridge
problems fall into the same factor category; therefore, the
difference between the two problems cannot be attributed to
emotional involvement. In addition, results of the structural
equation modeling suggest that they differ in engagement of
the rational processing. Some theoretical suggestions were
discussed.

Introduction
Is it permissible to sacrifice a few lives in order to save
many others? This is a central question in the debate
between utilitarianism and deontology. Utilitarians (e.g.,
Bentham, 1789; 1948) argue that it is permissible to do so
because saving more lives results in greater utility for
society than saving only one, whereas deontologists (e.g.,
Kant, 1965) argue that it is not permissible because life is an
ultimate right that should not be violated, irrespective of the
amount of benefit yielded by its sacrifice. This debate has
drawn the attention of various researchers, who have
proposed many answers to the issue (see e.g., Singer, 1979;
Thomson, 1986; Greene & Haidt, 2002; Mikhail, 2009).
This conundrum is complicated by the fact that the
permissibility of sacrificing the few lives depends on the
context of the question, even when the numbers of people
sacrificed and saved remain the same. The trolley and
footbridge dilemmas (Thomson, 1985) are the most
prominent examples of this context dependency. The trolley
dilemma supposes that a runaway trolley is headed for five
people who will be killed if it proceeds on its present course.
The only way to save these people is to hit a switch that will
turn the trolley onto an alternate set of tracks, where it will
kill one person instead of five. Should you turn the trolley in
order to save five people at the expense of one? This
problem, known as the trolley dilemma, most people answer
yes to this dilemma (Greene et al, 2001). Then consider the
footbridge dilemma, in which (as before) a trolley threatens
to kill five people. You are standing next to a large stranger

on a footbridge that spans the tracks, in between the
oncoming trolley and the five people. In this scenario, the
only way to save the five people is to push this stranger off
the bridge and onto the tracks below. He will die if you do
this, but his body will stop the trolley from reaching the
others. Should you save them by pushing this stranger to his
death? Most people answer no to this problem. The
discrepancy between the answers to the two problems
clearly demonstrates the context dependency described
above, and challenges both philosophers and psychologists
who are interested in people’s criteria for moralistic action.
One prominent solution to this discrepancy is provided
by Greene et al. (2001). They hypothesize that the
footbridge dilemma engages the emotions while the trolley
dilemma does not. This is because pushing someone to his
or her death is more emotionally salient than hitting a switch
that will cause a trolley to produce similar consequences,
resulting in different treatment of the two cases. To test this
hypothesis, they performed brain-imaging studies in which
participants were required to solve a number of moral
dilemmas, including some that were similar to the trolley
and footbridge dilemmas. Greene et al. (2001) hypothesized
that brain areas associated with emotions would be more
active during contemplation of dilemmas such as the
footbridge dilemma than they would be during
contemplation of dilemmas such as the trolley dilemma.
Their results consistently supported their predictions. Brain
areas that are considered to reflect emotional processing,
such as the medial portions of Brodmann’s Areas (BA) 9
and 10 (the medial frontal gyrus), BA 31 (the posterior
cingulated gyrus), and BA 39 (the angular gyrus, bilateral)
were significantly more active when solving moral
dilemmas similar to the footbridge dilemma than when
solving moral dilemmas similar to the trolley dilemma.
Greene et al. (2001) use the brain-imaging method to shed
light on the importance of emotional processing in the
formation of moral judgments. Traditional theories of moral
psychology emphasize the role of reasoning and higher
cognition in the making of such judgments (Kohlberg, 1969;
Greene et al., 2004). For example, Kohlberg and his
colleagues (Kohlberg, 1969) explore moral reasoning by
presenting participants with dilemmas in which moral and
non-moral claims exist within both alternatives, and then
observing their methods of resolving the conflicts. The
social intuitionist approach (Nucci & Turiel, 1978; Turiel,
1983; Turiel, Killen, & Helwig, 1987) adopts the
methodology of interviewing children about rule violations.
This approach requires children to think about moral rule
and provide justifications for their conclusions. Both

1084

Kohlberg’s approach and the social intuitionist approach
employ rationalist methods because they mainly focus on
the role of the conscious reasoning process in resolving
moral dilemmas. They also fail to study the neural correlates
of moral judgment. In contrast to these approaches, Greene
et al.’s (2001) work stands out because it considers and
explores the role of emotion using brain-imaging methods.
In fact, most subsequent studies have centered on the role
and neural basis of emotional processing in moral reasoning
(see e.g., Greene et al., 2004; Moll et al., 2005; Harenski &
Hamann, 2006).
In this study, we pay attention to how the emotional and
rational processing affects the moral judgment. However,
we also point out that methodology adopted by the previous
studies is insufficient to explore our research interests. In
what follows, we argue methodological problems of the
previous studies and explain our approach to address these
concerns.

Defining emotions and moral dilemmas
The term “emotion” must be defined before we can
investigate its place in the formation of moral judgment.
However, the definition of the relationship between
emotional processing and moral reasoning depends upon the
interpretation of the moral dilemmas used. Thus, researchers
must specify a feature of the moral dilemmas that clearly
engages the emotions. To do this, we first look at the
definition of emotion in previous studies.
Greene et al. (2001; see also Greene & Haidt, 2002)
distinguish between moral-personal and moral-impersonal
situations. They categorize a moral violation as personal if it
is (i) likely to cause serious bodily harm, (ii) to a particular
person, (iii) in such a way that the harm does not result from
the deflection of an existing threat onto a different party.
They derive these three criteria from Thomson (1986) in a
provisional attempt to capture what is considered a natural
distinction of moral psychology (Greene et al., 2004). They
then requested two independent coders to evaluate a
selection of moral dilemmas using these criteria.
Consequently, 19 and 25 dilemmas were classified into the
moral-impersonal
and
moral-personal
categories,
respectively. Greene et al. also used 20 non-moral dilemmas
in their study; therefore, they showed participants 64 types
of the moral dilemmas. They then specified the neural
correlates of moral reasoning by comparing the average
brain activity of the participants during contemplation of
these dilemmas (Greene et al., 2001). This methodology is
also adopted in subsequent studies exploring the neural
correlates of moral reasoning (Greene et al., 2004; Moll et
al., 2005; Harenski & Hamann, 2008).
However, this method of defining emotional processing
contains the three following problems. First, Greene et al.’s
(2001) three criteria yield an imperfect distinction between
the moral-personal and the moral-impersonal. A dilemma is
moral-personal if it satisfies all three criteria, and moralimpersonal if it does not. Consequently, a moral-impersonal
dilemma may differ from a moral-personal dilemma for

many reasons; a dilemma-causing action might be
considered moral-impersonal because it cannot reasonably
be expected to lead to serious bodily harm, because it does
not cause serious bodily harm to a particular person or a
member or members of a particular group of people, or
because the harm it causes is the result of deflecting an
existing threat onto a different party. That is, Greene et al.
(2001) define the distinction between the two dilemmas in
terms of combinations among the three criteria. Accordingly,
a dilemma may be categorized as moral-impersonal for
many reasons. Thus, the criteria do not clearly define the
differences between the moral-personal and the moralimpersonal, and the meaning of emotional processing
remains unclear.
Second, data analysis in Greene et al. (2001) was based
on brain activity averages for the three types of dilemmas
(moral-personal, moral-impersonal, and non-moral). While
Greene et al. referred to the difference between the
footbridge and trolley dilemmas, their findings were not
based on comparison of data for the trolley and footbridge
dilemmas but on comparison of data for the moral-personal
and moral-impersonal dilemmas. That is, they compared
average brain activation for the two moral categories. Thus,
they discovered only the average difference in activated
brain areas between the moral-personal and moralimpersonal dilemmas, but not how each dilemma activated
the brain areas associated with emotion.
Finally, the moral dilemmas were only classified by two
coders. It is thus possible that although the data supported
the hypothesis, the study’s definitions of the moral-personal
and moral-impersonal dilemmas are shaped by these two
coders, and that their classifications of the dilemmas are not
universally correct. To eliminate this possibility, the moral
dilemmas should be explored using procedures of greater
objectivivity, such as quantitative analysis of their statistical
properties.
The above problems strongly suggest a necessity of
quantitative analysis of the moral dilemmas. Although the
distinction between the moral personal and moralimpersonal is widely accepted, its validity has not been fully
examined. What dimensions are needed to measure moral
reasoning performances? How do the moral dilemmas
compare with each other in those dimensions? We must
answer these questions in order to classify the moral
dilemmas and consider their relationship to emotional
processing. However, the latent structure of moral reasoning
has not been explored in previous studies.
Thus, the present study aims to examine the empirical
validity of Greene et al.’s (2001) three criteria. For this
purpose, we instructed participants to solve the dilemmas
used in Greene et al. (2001), and explored correlation
structure among the dilemmas via multivariate analysis
methods such as factor analysis and structural equation
modeling. These methods are appropriate for this study
because they provide quantitative expressions of the
relationships or similarities among variables. Our
experiment will show that Greene et al.’s (2001) three

1085

criteria for distinguishing between the two types of moral
dilemmas are almost valid, but also reveal that emotional
processing does not differ substantially between the trolley
and footbridge dilemmas. Rather, the dilemmas differ
mainly in terms of rational processing.

Methods
Participants
Two hundreds and nineteen undergraduates participated in
this study in order to obtain credits for their courses. The
data of nineteen participants was excluded because they did
not answer all the problems.

Materials and procedure
The participants completed 62 dilemma tasks that had been
chosen from Greene et al. (2001). Like the trolley and
footbridge dilemmas, these dilemmas presented three types
of problems for which participants had to choose between
two options that were incompatible with each other. We
excluded two of Greene et al.’s (2001) dilemmas because
they involved issues we deemed too sensitive to pose to
undergraduates. One is an “infanticide” problem that
requires participants to decide whether it is acceptable for a
girl to kill her baby. The other is a “hired rapist” problem
that asks them to determine whether it is defensible to hire a
man to rape one’s wife so that she will be grateful to her
husband for comforting her. These two problems were
moral-personal dilemmas; therefore, our experimental tasks
consisted of 20 non-moral dilemmas, 19 moral-impersonal
dilemmas, and 23 moral-personal dilemmas.
We prepared six types of booklets containing the 62
dilemmas in randomly determined order, with six dilemmas
on each page. Including instruction, the booklets comprised
12 pages. The instruction page used an example dilemma to
demonstrate how to answer the questionnaire, and the 62
dilemmas began from the second page. Participants were
randomly provided with one of the six types of booklets and
asked to make choices in various situations that did not have
correct answers. All participants finished answering the 62
dilemmas within 40 minutes. Data collection was performed
in the classroom.

Results
Item responses
The data of nineteen participants was deleted because it
contained missing values. Table 1 shows the percentages of
participants who thought the behaviors described in the
corresponding dilemmas acceptable. Greene et al. (2001; see
also Greene et al., 2004) do not report precise values for the
percentages of acceptable behaviors in their study, so we
cannot tell whether the general pattern of responses in our
study replicates that in theirs. However, we compared our
results with the percentages of acceptable behaviors
reported in other articles (see e.g., Greene & Haidt, 2002;

Mikhail, 2009) and found that our results duplicate trends
observed in those articles. For example, the percentage of
acceptability in our study is higher for the trolley dilemma
(0.69) than it is for the footbridge dilemma (0.38), and the
difference between them is statistically significant (p-value
[p] < 0.01). This pattern accords with Greene and Haidt’s
(2002) findings. Additionally, the percentage of
acceptability for the five-to-seven trolley dilemma, which
asks participants whether it is acceptable to hit a switch to
save five workmen instead of seven people in the trolley
situation, is significantly lower than the percentage of
unacceptability in both our study and that of Mikhail’s
(2009, p34). Despite limitations on our ability to compare
the results of our study with those of previous studies, these
correspondences show that our study reproduces the general
pattern of responses to the moral dilemmas tested in
previous studies.

Factor pattern
Using Mplus Version 6 (Muthen & Muthen, 2007), we
performed factor analysis on the tetrachoric correlation
matrix of the 62 dilemmas, and employed the promax
rotation method by maximum likelihood estimation.
Eigenvalues for the first five factors were 12.36, 8.20, 3.08,
3.06, and 2.77, respectively. Decreases in the eigenvalues
were very small after the third factor, but we chose a fourfactor solution because it exhibits a factor pattern with a
very simple structure (see Table 1). This solution reveals
that most of the problems used in this study are strongly
loaded by one factor, indicating that they can be clearly
classified into one of four categories. We then considered
the substance of the problems in order to identify the four
factors.
The first factor mainly affects the non-moral dilemmas.
Perusal of dilemmas that are strongly loaded by this factor
shows that it reflects a tendency to think over matters in a
rational way. Thus, we named this factor the rationality
factor.
The second factor mainly affects the moral-personal
dilemmas, such as the footbridge dilemma. However, this
factor also strongly affects the trolley dilemma, which is a
moral-impersonal dilemma. Careful consideration of the
dilemmas that are strongly loaded by this factor shows that
most of them involve a situation in which a few people may
be sacrificed to save many lives. In addition, most of the
dilemmas involving such a situation are affected by this
factor, which we thus call the life dilemma factor.
The third and fourth factors affect most of the impersonal
moral dilemmas. We examined these dilemmas and found
that these factors represent risk- or cost-avoiding tendencies.
That is, the third factor mainly affects dilemmas that require
choosing between the lower probability of a larger benefit
and the higher probability of a smaller benefit, and the
fourth factor reflects a preference for saving on a cost in
order to pursue a plan. Thus, we call the third and fourth
factors the risk-averse factor and the efficiency factor,
respectively.

3)**:p <.01.

Correlations among the first, third, and fourth factors are
relatively high as compared to those among the second and
other factors (see Table 1). Given the character of the
factors, this factor correlation pattern is very natural because
the first, third, and fourth factors indicate rational
processing, whereas the second factor relates to emotional
processing. In other words, this result supports the dual
processing model of moral judgment proposed by Greene et
al. (2004; see also Greene & Haidt, 2004).
The factor patterns demonstrate the two following points.
First, the factor pattern of the four-factor solution generally
supports Greene et al.’s (2001) dilemma classification
scheme. The correlation structure of the dilemmas
corroborates Greene et al.’s (2001) methods of
distinguishing among the three categories of dilemmas,
especially the criteria for differentiating between the moralpersonal and the non-moral dilemmas. While the moralimpersonal dilemmas may be affected by either one of two
factors, they are distinguished from the moral-personal and
non-moral dilemmas.
In addition, the nature and factor loadings of the
dilemmas by the four factors confirm Greene et al.’s (2001)
hypothesis that the moral-personal dilemmas engage the
emotional process more than the moral-impersonal or nonmoral dilemmas do. The inherent qualities of the dilemmas
that are heavily loaded by the second factor strongly suggest
that it concerns the emotional process because the decision
to sacrifice a few people to save many others is surely based
on an emotional response. For these reasons, our analysis
validates Greene et al.’s (2001) interpretation of the moralpersonal dilemmas.
Second, the factor pattern does not distinguish clearly
between the trolley and footbridge dilemmas, although it
categorizes the moral-personal dilemmas in the same way as
Greene et al. (2001) do. For these two problems, factor
loadings by the second factor are almost identical (-0.67 for
the trolley dilemma and -0.64 for the footbridge dilemma).
If, as we argue, the second factor represents engagement of
the emotional process, then the trolley and footbridge
problems are almost equivalent in their reliance on this
process. This contradicts Greene et al.’s (2001) hypothesis,
which posits that these problems belong to different
dilemma types. It is plausible that the near-equivalence of
the factor loadings for the two problems mainly reflects the
similarity of the contexts in which they are framed. Both
problems address a situation in which a runaway trolley will
kill five persons, regardless of whether the respondent is on
a railroad or a footbridge. Thus, the trolley and the
footbridge dilemmas may have similar factor loadings
solely because they present the same situation.
However, the factor pattern for the disproportional death
dilemma controverts this possibility. Factor loading by the
second factor for this problem is low (-0.24), whereas factor
loadings by the first and third factors are relatively high (0.37 and -0.51, respectively; see Table 1). This indicates
that this type of trolley problem is different from the
standard trolley and footbridge problems, which are strongly

1087

loaded by the second factor, and suggests that the similarity
in factor loading between the trolley and footbridge
dilemmas is not solely due to context.
The results of the factor analysis can be summarized as
follows. The factor pattern of the four-factor solution
generally supports Greene et al.’s (2001) dilemma
classification scheme. In particular, the correlation structure
of the data corroborates Greene et al.’s (2001)
categorization of most of the dilemmas. However, the
analysis does not verify their interpretation of the dilemmas’
contents. Greene et al. insist that the difference between the
trolley and footbridge dilemmas lies in the engagement of
the emotional process, but our results indicate that they
differ in the involvement of the rational reasoning process.

To further explore the difference between the trolley and the
footbridge dilemmas, we performed structural equation
modeling (see Figure 1). Our model aims to investigate the
differences between the two dilemmas in terms of the
pattern of effects created by the four factors. The four
factors are each defined by the dilemma whose factor
loading for that factor exceeds 0.40 in absolute value, and
both dilemmas are assumed to be affected by only one of
the four factors (see Figure 1). The Root Mean Square Error
of Approximation (RMSEA) value of this model is below
0.065, indicating that the model accounts for more than 90%
of the data variances. In addition, the value of the
Comparative Fit Index (CFI) is 0.837; this shows that the
model is a better fit for the data than the independent model
is. (The latter assumes that the sixty-odd dependent
variables under examination are mutually unrelated.) Thus,
the model shown in Figure 1 is a good approximation of the
data.
Structural equation modeling shows that the path
coefficients for the life dilemma factor do not differ
substantially between the trolley and footbridge dilemmas
(0.94 and 0.80, respectively; p < 0.01). However, the
dilemmas differ in respect of the patterns created by the
effects of the other three factors. Whereas the footbridge
dilemma is significantly affected by the risk-averse factor
(path coefficient = -0.48; p< 0.01), the trolley dilemma is
affected by the efficiency and rationality factors (path
coefficients = -0.54 and -0.25, respectively; p < 0.01).
Of course, this still leaves room to discuss the validity of
correspondences among the four factors and emotional and
rational processing. However, this study provides another
scheme for describing the difference between the trolley and
the footbridge dilemmas. If the life dilemma factor reflects
emotional processing whereas the other three factors reflect
rational processing, then our results suggest that the
difference between the trolley and footbridge dilemmas
mainly lies not in their engagement of the emotional process,
but in the extent to which rational processing affects
judgment of these dilemmas.

General discussion
This study aims to explore the nature of moral dilemmas
such as the trolley or footbridge dilemmas by analyzing the
correlation structure of the 62 dilemma problems employed
in Greene et al. (2001). Its results can be summarized as
follows. First, the study supports Greene et al.’s (2001)
distinctions between the moral-personal and moralimpersonal dilemmas. Second, factor patterns and structural
equation modeling show that the difference between the
trolley and footbridge problems is not due to the extent to
which they engage the emotional process, as Greene et al.
(2001) have hypothesized. Rather, judgment of the trolley
and footbridge problems differs due to the varying
involvement of the rational reasoning process.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to use statistical
methods to test the three criteria proposed by Greene et al.
(2001). Since the existing criteria for classifying moral
dilemmas mainly depend on philosophical or intuitive
principles, the study contributes to the field of moral
reasoning by conducting empirical research that
demonstrates that a meaningful classification method can be
derived from the correlation structure of the data. Future
research should use statistical analysis to more rigorously
explore the latent structure of moral reasoning. Specifically,
it should describe the quantitative features of each moral
dilemma in order to promote a better understanding of the
moral reasoning process.

From a theoretical standpoint, this study suggests that it is
important to investigate the role of rational processing in
moral judgment. This is the perspective adopted in the
traditional approach to this subject (Kohlberg, 1969; Nucci
& Turiel, 1978; Turiel, 1983; 1998; Turiel, Killen, &
Helwig, 1987). However, Greene et al.’s (2001) pioneering
work has altered the focus of recent studies on moral
reasoning, which use brain imaging to show how emotional
processing functions when people solve moral dilemmas.

Our results indicate that moral dilemmas differ from each
other not only in the engagement of the emotional process
but also in the involvement of the rational process, which is
triggered by mental activities such as considering the risk or
efficiency of actions. Of course, this study does not deny the
findings of brain imaging studies, including those of Greene
et al. (2001). Rather, it suggests that the two approaches to
moral reasoning (the traditional approach and the one
developed by Greene et al. [2001; 2004]) are
complementary. Both the emotional and rational processes
contribute to moral reasoning, and their roles in the
resolution of moral dilemmas must be understood if we are
to uncover the processes of moral judgment.
It is noteworthy that the difference between the
footbridge and trolley dilemmas lies in the engagement of
the rational process rather than that of the emotional process.
This finding disagrees with the prevailing view that the
footbridge dilemma is more emotionally salient than the
trolley dilemma is (Greene et al., 2001; 2004). However,
this theory is derived from brain activation averages for the
moral-personal and moral-impersonal dilemmas. This
means that the effect of individual dilemmas on brain areas
has not been fully explored, although the trolley and
footbridge dilemmas have been analyzed as representations
of the moral-personal and moral-impersonal dilemmas,
respectively. In contrast to previous studies, this study has
analyzed the correlation structure of each dilemma. Thus, it
has examined Greene et al.’s hypothesis (2001) more
directly than any preceding study has, and has demonstrated
the importance of the rational process in forming moral
judgments.
Finally, we argue that future research should provide
precise definitions of the terms “emotional” and “rational.”
While this study has developed a new scheme for
understanding the nature of moral judgment, it has not
clarified the relationship between the emotional process and
the life dilemma factor. Intuitively, this relationship is
natural; however, we cannot explain why moral-personal
dilemma enhances the emotional process. Greene et al.
(2004) argue that the moral-personal dilemma and the
emotional process are related from an evolutionary
standpoint, but this argument depends solely on the
importance of personal relationships in human life;
consequently, the term “emotion” becomes merely a
paraphrase of something crucial in moral judgment. We
believe that a precise definition of this term is essential to a
profound understanding of moral judgment.
