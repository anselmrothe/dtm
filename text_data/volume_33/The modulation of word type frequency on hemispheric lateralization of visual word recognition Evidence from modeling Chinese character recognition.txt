prediction, the dominant type had a stronger LH (HSF)

bilateral models.
     To test whether the above effects were due to the
existence of a phonetic radical that biased phonological
information to one component (i.e. whether decomposition
was required), in a separate simulation, instead of mapping
each character systematically to the pronunciation of its
phonetic radical, we mapped each character to a randomly
assigned pronunciation in the output layer (i.e. logographic
mapping). The results (figure 5, bottom row) showed a
