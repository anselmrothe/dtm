environmental statistics that have been acquired via past
experience. A cognitive system that relies on the statistics
of its environment to perform its tasks will soon run out of
resources as the computational cost of keeping the joint
statistics of the environmental variables grows exponentially
in the number of variables that the system is keeping track
of (an issue known as the curse of dimensionality; Bishop,
2006). By employing a hierarchic structure in recording the
statistics, the system can bring the computational cost of the
task under control. In addition to this computational
advantage, hierarchic systems have been shown to be more
stable and evolve faster than their alternatives (Simon,
2002).
   While on the one hand it is inherently beneficial for
systems to have a hierarchic structure, on the other hand,
specifically in the case of perception, it is beneficial for a
system to employ a hierarchic structure to represent its
environment. Indeed, in the visual domain objects seem to
present themselves to us in a hierarchic way. For example, a
face is composed of two eyes, one nose, one mouth etc.; an
eye is in turn composed of the iris, pupil, eyelashes etc. Is
this hierarchy merely apparent, simply because of the
hierarchic structure of our own perceptual system, or is it
truly “out there”?.

node, e_19, in the non-hierarchic condition e_6 and e_7 are
governed by both e_20 and e_22, while e_8 depends on e_5,
and e_5 is conditionally independent of other nodes (i.e., its
values do not depend on the values of the other nodes). The
point is that even though there still exists a network of
hidden causes that could in principle be used to infer the
category of the stimuli, the more complicated structure of
dependencies makes such inference more difficult to
perform.
Procedures
Eight participants (4 male and 4 female) took part in the
experiment. Each participant performed both the hierarchic
and the non-hierarchic conditions in a randomized order.

                                                        classifications for each participant in each condition. On
                                                        average, participants performed ~79% correct in the
                                                        hierarchic condition compared to ~63% correct in the non-
                                                        hierarchy condition (figure 6). This difference in
                                                        performance is statistically significant as confirmed by the
                                                        nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test (χ 2 = 104.91,
                                                        df = 1, p < 2.2e-16). We also fit a linear mixed model to the
                                                        data, to ensure that even when ll the random effects are
                                                        considered jointly, significance is still reliable (Baayen,
                                                        2006), using the lmer procedure (Bates, 2005). A binomial
                                                        logit-link linear mixed model fit to the scores yielded a
                                                        significant effect of condition (z = 9.85 p < 2.2e-16). To
                                                        explore the effect of gradual learning, we added trial
                                                        number (in increments of 10) as an independent variable to
                                                        the linear mixed model. In this analysis, the main effect of
                                                        condition became n.s., the effect of trial number and the
                                                        interaction between trial number and condition were both
                                                        highly significant (z = 17.96, p < 2e-16, and z = 7.267, p <
                                                        3.67e-13, respectively; see figure 5).
                                                                         Concluding Remarks
                                                        There are several ways in which a structure can differ from
                                                        a hierarchy. For example, links can skip levels, or the
                                                        direction of the causation can be reversed. Consequently,
                                                        further experiments are required to pin down the effect of
                                                        each of them. Furthermore, the distinction between a
                                                        hierarchy and a non-hierarchy is not all or none; rather it is a
                                                        graded property, with perfect hierarchy at one extreme and
                                                        heterarchy at the other extreme. We have been unable,
                                                        however, to find a standard measure of the degree of
                                                        hierarchicality in the existing literature. Developing and
                                                        motivating such a measure is a topic for future work.
                                                           Another issue for future research is the possibility that
                                                        subjects performed worse in the non-hierarchic condition of
                                                        our experiment because the patterns in that condition were
                                                        more complex. We plan to use the information entropy
                                                        (Shannon, 1949) of the two graphs, as well as other
                                                        measures of pattern generator complexity, in investigating
                                                        this possibility. In the present study, we controlled for
                                                        pattern complexity at the level of the leaves of the graph, by
                                                        using stimuli that have the same appearance in both
                                                        conditions.
