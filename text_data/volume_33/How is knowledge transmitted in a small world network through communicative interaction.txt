Goldstone and Janssen (2005) emphasized the importance
of research on collective behavior. For example, they point
out that “interacting ants create colony architectures that no
single ant intends,” and “populations of neurons create
structured thought, permanent memories and adaptive
responses that no neuron can comprehend by itself” (p.424).
By implication, interactions among individuals produce
unique processes of knowledge acquisition that are not
clarified by research on micro processes of an individual’s
knowledge acquisition.
   In this paper, we discuss knowledge transmission which
occurs through interactions of individuals. This topic is very

p=1 was about 0.04 (0.643-0.688). Figure 1 shows that path
lengths substantially become shorter as probability of
rewiring increases until p=0.1. Thus, this relationship
between path lengths and CNr implies that path length
influences CNr in a network.
   Cowan and Jonard (2004) showed that agents in a small
world network (i.e., p=0.09) could achieve the maximum
level of knowledge accumulation. Results of our simulations
showed that agents in the random world network (i.e., p=1)
could achieve correct knowledge at the maximum level.
However, the value of CNr in p=0.1 is closed to CNr in p=1,
suggesting that agents in a small world network could
acquire correct knowledge.
   Our simulation architecture mainly differs from Cowan
and Jonard (2004) in the following two ways. First, the
criteria of learning (i.e., knowledge accumulation or
correctness of knowledge) differed. Second, the algorithms
of communication between agents differed. Therefore, our
simulation and Cowan and Jonard (2004) basically
examined different aspects of knowledge acquisition. In
common between our simulation and that of Cowan and
Jonard (2004) is the network in which the agents are set.
Therefore, our results and those of Cowan and Jonard
(2004) indicate that the network structure among agents
plays important roles in knowledge acquisition, irrespective
of the criteria of learning (i.e., quantity or quality of
knowledge) and the algorithm of communications.

shown that interactions between individuals can explain the
knowledge structures that people possess (e.g., Brighton,

macro and social network level can make contributions for
clarifying not only interactions among individuals, but also
individual cognitive processes.
