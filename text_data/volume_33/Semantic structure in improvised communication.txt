   The complements of perception verbs [. . . ] do not de-
   scribe the external object that may be perceived, but
   rather the way the perceived object appears.
In other words, for perception verbs, like for other intensional
verbs, it is not the external object that is important for their
interpretation, but the intension. This shows that perception
verbs have at least an intensional flavor.
   For our experiments, we have taken the widest definition of
‘intensional’ and included all verbs that have an intensional
flavor.
