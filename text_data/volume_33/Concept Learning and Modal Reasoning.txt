   Philosophers and linguists have suggested that the meaning of
   a concept can be represented by a rule or function that picks
   out examples of the concept across all possible worlds. We
   turn this idea into a computational model of concept learning,
   and demonstrate that this model helps to account for two as-
   pects of human learning. Our first experiment explores how
   humans learn relational concepts such as ‚Äútaller‚Äù that are de-
   fined with respect to a context set. Our second experiment ex-
   plores modal inferences, or inferences about whether states of
   affairs are possible or impossible. Our model accounts for the
   results of both experiments, and suggests that possible worlds
   semantics can help to explain how humans learn and use con-
   cepts.

The objects in the first two worlds are labeled with respect to concept CA (upper right triangles), and the remaining two worlds
are labeled with respect to concept CB (lower right triangles). The bar charts show model predictions and human inferences
about the six questions shown at the bottom right of the figure. Model predictions (black bars) are probabilities, and human
inferences (white bars) are shown as mean judgments on a 7 point scale. Error bars show the standard error of the mean.
