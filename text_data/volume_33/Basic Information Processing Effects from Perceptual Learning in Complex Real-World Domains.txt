characters' stroke count (high or low) served as a non-
structural control task.
   Before and after training, we directly tested for basic
information processing changes using a visual search task.
The visual search task was a transfer task: It tested search
efficiencies for stimuli that were never presented in the
learning phase. We found consistent and reliable effects on
visual search efficiency from structure and component
training, relative to the stroke-count control condition,
including some effects specifically related to different types
of PL training. A key finding was that training to classify
based on structure led to markedly improved visual search
performance when targets and distractors shared a common
structure, even for novel structures.

targets and distractors involved structure and components
that had been seen in PLM training and whether the search
displays contained heterogeneous or homogeneous
distractors (See Figure 3).
   As expected, Structure and Component PLM training
produced significant changes on visual search based on
structure and component similarity. The effect of Structure
PLM training was most notable in displays with
heterogeneous distractors, while Component PLM training
produced significant changes in search with homogeneous
displays. This pattern was confirmed by a significant
interaction of structure-similarity (same structure, different
structure) x PLM (Structure, Component, Stroke) x display

effects on search improvement in each display type were
due to the type of classification training.
    For heterogeneous displays, the most improved
performance was found with Structure PLM training for
search when targets and distractors shared the same
