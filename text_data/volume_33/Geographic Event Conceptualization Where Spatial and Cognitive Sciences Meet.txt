Materials
We followed a design from our previous experiments
(Klippel & Li, 2009). This design is inspired by the
endpoint hypothesis (Regier, 1996; Regier & Zheng,
2007) and we distinguished movement patterns on the
basis of the topological relations at the end of the
movement. The basis for this distinction is a conceptual
neighborhood graph, CNG (Freksa, 1992), that is
derived from eight topologically distinguished spatial
relations as part of either Egenhofer’s intersection
models (Egenhofer & Franzosa, 1991) or the region
connection calculus, RCC (Randell, et al., 1992). This
conceptual neighborhood graph is shown in Figure 1.
  We created eight icons (both static and dynamic) for
each of the following nine topological equivalence              Figure 1. Conceptual neighborhood graph (left) and

   A paired samples t-test shows a statistically
significant difference between static and dynamic
presentation. Icons in the static condition are grouped
together more often than are the corresponding icons in
the dynamic condition (dynamic: M = 10.22, SD = 2.22;
static: M = 12.89, SD=2.37; t(8) = -6.532, p<0.001).
This indicates that the mode of presentation influences
the conceptualization of events.
