   Figure 4(a) shows for every frequency range (as well as
non-wavelet-transformed EEG) the CC of the upramp. This
correlation is largest in the 2–4 Hz delta and 4–9 Hz theta
bands. The CC in the theta band is specific to the dots con-

a neural correlate of evidence accumulation than delta oscil-

lower correlation [in the theta band the CCs are 0.11 for the
