sistently with the Nash equilibrium and select zero. Compare
this with Matching Pennies, in which iterated reasoning leads
to uniformly random play.
   The Beauty Pageant can be used to study iterated reason-
ing, because if participants choose a value higher than zero,
an investigator can infer the number of thinking steps that
must have been behind that choice. A player thinking zero
steps ahead will expect others to play randomly and select a
value that is 2/3 of this mean: 33. A player who selected 2/3
of 33 must have been thinking one step ahead, and a player
who was thinking two steps ahead will choose a value that is
two-thirds of that.
   In the first experimental studies of the Beauty Pageant,
guesses were well above zero (Nagel, 1995). Nagel’s re-
sults were consistent with the hypothesis that most partici-
pants think only one or two steps ahead. In subsequent rounds
of play, participants all started guessing lower, and selections
crept slowly down towards the equilibrium at zero.
   In the first round of play, a persistent fraction of partici-     Figure 1. Screenshot of game board. Players earn one point for
