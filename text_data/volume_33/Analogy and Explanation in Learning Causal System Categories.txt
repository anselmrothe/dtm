Abstract: Causal system categories- e.g., positive feedback systems, are defined by common causal structure and
extend across disparate domains- e.g., population growth and polar ice-cap melting are both governed by positive
feedback. However, recognizing common causal systems across domains is challenging. Prior research suggests
these categories are not obvious to novices; when participants sorted descriptions of natural phenomena that varied
in causal system and content domain, science experts sorted via causal system, while novices primarily sorted by
domain (Rottman, Gentner, & Goldwater in prep). In the current study, novices received training with a small set of
real-world phenomena before carrying out the sorting task. We varied whether they read full causal explanations of
the phenomena and whether they analogically compared pairs of descriptions from the same causal system. Either
reading full explanations or analogically comparing descriptions alone helped little. However, combining analogy and
explanation largely facilitated causal sorting, approximating expert levels.
