consideration when using RQs in that a proper use of
rhetorical question can make our life go smoothly while an
improper use of RQs can damage the communication.
   Being the first attempt to analyze RQs under the
Prototype Theory of Categorization, this study bears some
limitations. The first limitation of the present study is the
source of data. The data in this study mainly come from
conversations in situation comedy, while the proportion of
the oral data based on the daily conversations is relatively
small. As a result, the illustration is less powerful and
convincing. Secondly, not all forms of RQs are covered in
this study. Some RQs do not end in question marks but in
exclamation points, or sometimes they just indicated by
rhetorical intonation. This study could have a broader
coverage of those forms of RQs.
