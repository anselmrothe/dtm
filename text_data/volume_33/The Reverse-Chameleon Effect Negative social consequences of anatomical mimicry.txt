Abstract: Mirror mimicry has well-known consequences for the person being mimicked: it increases how positively
they feel about the mimicker (the Chameleon Effect). Here we show that anatomical mimicry has the opposite
social consequences: a Reverse-Chameleon Effect. To equate mirror and anatomical mimicry, we asked participants
to have a face-to-face conversation with a digital human (VIRTUO), in a fully-immersive virtual environment.
Participants’ spontaneous head movements were tracked, and VIRTUO mimicked them at a 2-second delay, either
mirror-wise, anatomically, or not at all (instead enacting another participant’s movements). Participants who were
mimicked mirror-wise rated their social interaction with VIRTUO to be significantly more positive than those who
were mimicked anatomically. Participants who were not mimicked gave intermediate ratings. Beyond its practical
implications, the Reverse-Chameleon Effect constrains theoretical accounts of how mimicry affects social perception.
