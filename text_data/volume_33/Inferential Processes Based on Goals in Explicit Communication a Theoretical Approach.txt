Abstract: The paper shows how the explicit content of communication, that is ”what is said” by a speaker, is
obtained via inferential processes based on speaker’s goals. The proposal of the paper is based on the hypothesis
that meaning in use depends on extra-semantic interests of speakers with regard to a specific situation. Elsewhere
it is argued how interests affect on sentences of natural language when semantic context, semantic conventions and
standard pragmatic context are not able to determine a unique meaning (Cruciani 2010a, 2009a). This paper specif-
ically faces the question of determination of meaning via inferential processes in which the conditions of possibility
of goals (interests) of speaker are premises of communicative inferences. In this approach is central the notion of
interest viewed as (preference for) a state of affairs which implies conditions of possibility of agent’s goal.
