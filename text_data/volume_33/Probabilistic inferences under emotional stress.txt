   The proportion of time devoted to the most valid cue was

   In contrast, emotional stress did not influence the
proportion of choices predicted by WADD—for this

   The above effect of emotional stress on the proportion of
choices consistent with take-the-best is in line with the
results of the information search analysis. Although the
process and outcome variables are conceptually different,
we observed high consistency of process and outcome
measures; that is, we observed correlations between the
variables describing the selectivity of search and the
proportion of choices predicted by take-the-best (Table 1).
