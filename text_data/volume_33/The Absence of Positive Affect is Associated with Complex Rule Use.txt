Materials The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck,
Steer, & Brown, 1996) is made up of 21 groups of
statements that assess the features of major depression (e.g.
sadness, loss of pleasure, changes in sleep, etc.). Subjects
are asked to think about how they have felt for the last two
weeks when responding.

scored in the severe depression range. As this was a

subjects is divided by category set completed in Table 1.
