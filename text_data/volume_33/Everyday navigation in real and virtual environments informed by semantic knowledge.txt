 Figure 1: The supermarket environment. The entrance is located at the bottom left. The produce section is marked by dark green coloring.
              Dark gray is used for the produce section and for the shelves that house cooled products (mainly dairy goods).
         Light gray is used for deep-frozen food and sales counters for meat, cheese, and fish. All other shelves remain uncolored.
