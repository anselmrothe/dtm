Abstract: This research explored the impact of graphical displays on individuals’ cognitive processes and online be-
haviors during information search and retrieval. Cognitive science research has demonstrated that a well-organized,
conceptual knowledge organization is a key difference between experts and novices. One method to help novices
move toward more expert-like performance may be to provide them with visual materials that support the develop-
ment of an organized representation of domain ideas. In this research, participants used graphical versus keyword
interfaces to complete searches for online educational materials; usability software was used to record participants’
on-screen interactions and think-aloud protocols. Results demonstrated that the graphical interface changed overall
patterns of search behaviors and promoted deeper, domain-related processing during search and evaluation. These
findings demonstrate that graphical displays can impact online, self-regulated learning, likely by providing a well-
organized structure of domain concepts that facilitates meaningful evaluation and more effective planning during
online information seeking.
