are astute social learners who are sensitive to informants’
reliability with respect to accuracy from very early on, we
do not know when the ability to make these more subtle
social evaluations develops.
   Indeed, we do not know to what extent even adults are
sensitive to teachers’ provision of partial information. Such
sins of omission are closely related to the Gricean Maxim of
Quantity: the idea that a speaker should provide all relevant
information in communicative contexts (Grice, 1975). Thus
for instance, a speaker is guilty of violating this maxim if
she (accurately) communicates that she has one sister when
in fact she has two. The computational analysis of pedagogy
can be thought of as providing a formalization of this kind
of pragmatic inference. Although to our knowledge, no
previous research has explicitly linked pedagogy and
pragmatics, there are grounds for believing that adults
should mistrust teachers who omit relevant information in                     Figure 1: Stimuli used in Experiments 1 and 2.
