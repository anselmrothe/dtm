interactions with exhibits begin with looking. Focus of
visual attention on an exhibit defines the beginning of an
event. The majority of events proceed from looking only to
looking and touching (figure 2). Most exhibit-related talk is
preceded by touch. When focusing on exhibit-related
behaviors, the data show a normative sequential pattern of
Look-Touch-Talk in 48% of all events. Social interactions
and physical constraints generate variations on this pattern.
