aspect affected production aspect in general, regardless of
whether a gesture was produced. To account for variation
across participants, we examined the proportion of matches
(utterances that agreed in presentation and production
aspect) for each participant. Table 1 shows these proportions
(SDs in parentheses).

     Presentation aspect is an independent variable but production
aspect is a dependent variable, thus a two-factor ANOVA is not
appropriate for these analyses (assumptions of independence are
violated). For this reason, we report results of Wilcoxon Signed
Ranks tests for non-parametric data (frequencies), and paired t-
tests for durations.

   To explore this result further, we first looked at the case
where presentation aspect was perfect, and compared mean
proportion of gestures with iteration in the two production
aspects. This test showed no significant difference in the
mean number of iterated gestures produced with progressive
or non-progressive utterances (Z = 1.196, p (two-tailed) =
.23). When an event had been originally described in the
perfect, people were no more likely to use iterated gestures
when they themselves were recounting that event using
progressive aspect than when they used perfect aspect.
   Second, we looked at the mean proportion of gestures
with iteration when presentation aspect was progressive.                Figure 3. Mean utterance duration (in msec) according to
