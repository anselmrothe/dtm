However there is actually little general agreement about
what good instruction is. Although good instruction includes
supporting cognitive, motivational, and emotional
characteristics, considering the strengths of students,
teaching basic knowledge and high-order skills, guiding
self-regulated learning, sustaining interest, and instilling
respect and responsibility (Astleitner, 2000), the definitions
of good instruction have not been simple. Zemelman et al.
(1998) described the special features of good instruction to
be student-centered, experiential, holistic, authentic,
expressive, reflective, collaborative, constructivist, and
challenging. According to Seo (2004), perspectives on good
instructional practice can be classified into four perspectives
in Korean school settings: transmission, constructivist,
relationship, and product based on the data interviewed.
There were different perspectives on good instruction
among grade levels or between teachers and students For
instance, teachers might perceive the definitions of good
instruction with constructivist and cognitive perspectives,
whereas students probably regarded good instruction as
interest or attaining high test scores (Tuckman, 2002).
However, few empirical studies have directly examined how
these elements are to be measured and the relationship of
perspectives on good instructions and instruction
effectiveness.
In fact, in Korea, constructivist-oriented educational
innovations have recently been applied to encourage
creative ability, practical application, and deep
understanding (Cho et al., 2002). Nevertheless, direct or
teacher-centered instruction based on transmission and
product is actually performed in the Korean classroom for
raising test scores (So, 2006). The reasons of this
phenomenon probably do not reflect students’ needs such as
characteristics of development or perspectives on instruction.
Namely, for example, if students want transmission-oriented
instruction, but teachers perform constructivist- oriented
instruction, there will be little effective instruction. Thus, it
is necessary that teachers create a classroom environment
based on data that reflects students’ perspectives on good
instruction.
The products of good instruction are generally course
interest, academic achievement and transfer. When teachers
provide students with a classroom environment, they should
focus on goals of the students’ course interest and academic
achievement (So, 2006). In particular, according to
instruction researchers (Seo, 2004; Lee et al., 2001),
student’s perceptions on good instruction are regarded as
important predictors of course satisfaction or academic
achievement.

Abstract

The purpose of present study was to develop an
instrument to measure perceptions on good instruction
for middle and high school students and to evaluate the
scale’s construct and criterion-related validity. The
participants were 998 8th and 11th graders. I performed
exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis for
construct validity and analyzed and structure equation
modeling among perspectives on good instruction,
course satisfaction, and academic achievement for
criterion reference validity. I found that the final
version of PGI(perceptions good instruction scale)
consisted of a five-factor solution (relationship,
transmission, constructivist, product, and interest) and
30 items. Results of structure equation modeling
revealed that perceptions on good instruction had
direct and indirect effects on academic achievement
mediated by course satisfaction.
Keywords: perceptions on good instruction, academic
achievement, course satisfaction

Introduction
Korean education focuses on strong competition for
success of the college entrance exam and learning outcomes
such as high scores or grades. One aspect of this emphasis
on performance is that Korean students and parents
concentrate on private education, and disregard public
education. Cho et al (2001) investigated the case studies of
good instruction in subjects such as Math and Science.
However, some previous studies did not consider the
concrete definition of good instruction. Lee et al. (2001)
surveyed what constitutes good instruction in a sample of
middle school students and teachers. Many participants
responded that good instruction was “interesting instruction”
and “well understood instruction”. Seo (2004) reported
various perspectives on good instruction and divided them
into transmission, constructivist, relationship, and product
after analyzing interview data with teachers and students.
Nevertheless, predictors of perspectives on good instruction
have not been identified in improving effects of instruction.
Furthermore few scales related to good instruction have
been developed.
In order to assess perspectives on good instruction, we
should first determine what constitutes good instruction.

The primary purpose of this study was to develop and
validate an instrument to measure perspectives on good
instruction. First I developed a questionnaire designed to
measure good instruction based on previous studies (Lee et
al., 2001; Seo, 2004). Next the validation of the instrument
was assessed by factorial structure and structure equation
modeling. To test the structure equation model, I
hypothesized that one model was that perspectives on good
instruction directly influenced course satisfaction and
academic achievement (Seo, 2004). Another model was that
perspectives on good instruction directly affected course
satisfaction (Murphy, 2004) and academic achievement and
also indirectly impacted academic achievement by
mediating course satisfaction simultaneously. In particular, I
measured perspectives on good instruction in the context of
mathematics, because compared to other subjects, Korean
students showed low interest and course satisfaction in math
(Yoon & Kim, 2003; So, 2008)

Academic achievement. For measuring academic
achievement we used the grade of midterm examination in
math.

Results
Factor analysis
Exploratory factor analysis
To examine the underlying factor structure of the PGI
Scale, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) [principal
components, varimax rotation] with a PGI scale was
performed. First of all, KMO(Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) and
Bartlett’s Test were performed to verify the suitability of
factor analysis with the data collected. KMO Measure of
Sampling Adequacy was .86, and Bartlett’s Test was p<.001
(χ2=7541.322, df=435). A five-factor solution accounting
for 45.58% of the variance was extracted. I deleted two
items which had low reliability, six items loaded below .40
and two items loaded on incorrect factors. As a result, the
perspective on good instruction inventory consisted of five
factors (relationship, transmission, constructivist, product,
and interest) and all 30 items (see Table 1). Their respective
variances were 14.99%, 8.76%, 8.36%, 7.22%, and 6.24%
of the total test score variance. The composite score of the
PGI has high internal reliability (alpha=.85) with the
subscale
internal
consistency
estimates
ranging
from .77(relationship) to .70(constructivist and interest).
The means, standard deviations and correlation matrix
between all factors, internal reliabilities are shown in Table
2.

Method
Participants
The participants were 448 8th graders (220 girls and 228
boys) and 550 11th graders (248 girls and 302 boys) from
two public middle schools and two public high schools in
Kyungnam, South Korea.

Measures
Perspective on Good Instruction Scale (PGI). A
measure for perspective on good instruction was developed
in the present research. First of all, I made open-ended
questionnaires on good instruction by referring to Seo (2004)
and Tuckman (2000)’s reports and then conducted a survey
with these questionnaires with 201 secondary school
students. I made closed-ended questions of 45 items for
measuring good instruction based on the survey results.
Pilot testing with 198 secondary school students confirmed
the adequacy of the items and overall structure of this scale.
A panel comprising 3 experts in effective instruction and 6
middle and high school teachers also reviewed the items for
content validity. Based on feedback from the panel and the
pilot testing, I deleted or reworded several items to give an
item pool of 40 items.

A. Relationship(Factor1 )
14. I think that good instruction
is to be concerned about
students’ feelings.
13. I think that good instruction
is to respect and trust students in
class.
15. I think that good instruction
is to accept students’ suggestions .
16. I think that good instruction
is to strengthen human relations
between teachers and students.

Course Satisfaction Inventory (CSI). Math course
satisfaction was assessed using a scale of So’s (2008) course
interest. I revised words of the scale to make it more
suitable for math classes. This scale comprised of 30 items
and subscales of satisfaction of learning environment,
teaching method, motivational support, and learning
guide (e. g. “My teacher provides students with autonomy
support in math class”). CSI was measured using a 5 point
rating scale. The reliability coefficient of this scale was
Cronbach’s alpha =.79.

Structure equation model (SEM) technique was employed
to conduct confirmatory factor analysis on the PGI scale
based on the result of Exploratory factor analysis. The
Confirmatory factor analysis of model on five factors of
perspectives on good instruction provided fit,
χ2=699.76(df=134), p<.001, GFI=.95, AGFI=.92,
RMSEA=.06, TLI=.90, NFI=.91. Namely, I found the fit of
the five factor model of perspectives on the good instruction
scale.
Perspectives on good instruction differences The 8th
and 11th grade was compared in perspectives on good
instruction (see Table 3). Result showed that 8th graders had
higher scores in relationship and constructivist perspectives,
in contrast 11 graders displayed higher scores in
transmission, product, and interest perspectives.

Criterion reference validity
In order to test the criterion validity of PGI, I investigated
the relationship between perspectives on good instruction,
course satisfaction, and academic achievement. The
intercorrelation matrix between five factors of perspective
on good instruction scale course satisfaction,
satisfaction and academic
achievement is shown in Table 4. Course satisfaction
sa
was
moderately corrected with transmission and product
perspective, and weakly related to the interest perspective.
Academic achievement was moderately associated with
constructivist and product perspectives.. Course satisfaction
displayed a positive association with academic achievement.

Discussion
The main purpose of the present
p
research was to develop
and validate perspectives on good instruction. To
accomplish this aim, I performed exploratory and
confirmatory factor analysis for construct validity and
analyzed correlation analysis and path analysis via structure
equation modeling among perspectives on good instruction,
course satisfaction, and academic achievement for criterion
reference validity. Additionally,
dditionally, I compared 8th with 11th
graders in perspectives on good instruction for differential
validity.
I found that the final version of PGI (perspective good
instruction scale) consisted of a five factors solution
(relationship,
relationship, transmission, constructivist, product, and
interest) and 30 items.. These factors were consistent with
perspectives displayed from previous studies (e. g. Seo,
2004). The differential validity of the PGI was also
investigated in this study. 8th graders were compared with
11th graders in terms of perspectives on good
g
instruction.
These two groups were differentiated across five subscales
of PGI. While 8th grade students had higher scores in
relationship, constructivist, and interest perspectives, 11th
grade students exhibited higher scores in transmission and
product perspectives. I interpreted these results to indicate
that 11th graders focused on cognition and lots of knowledge
for getting good scores and that they especially preferred
acquiring knowledge via summary and easy explanation
rather than through various
vario
teaching methods and
multimedia,, because compared with 8th graders, they might
feel that a university entrance examination is near at hand.
In particular, this finding reflected the Korean educational
situation. Classes in Korean schools
school generally have a strong
teacher-centered
centered orientation in which the instruction is

I hypothesized that the first model depicted the direct
relations between perspective on good instruction and
course satisfaction or academic achievement. The second
model displayed that perspectives on good instruction
instructi had
direct and indirect effects on academic achievement
mediated by course satisfaction. The models were examined
via SEM using the maximum likelihood. Results showed
that first model didn’t display a good fit to the data,

dominated by the teacher (Kim, 2002; Bong, 2003).
Furthermore, as the main goal of most Korean students is to
obtain high scores for entering high-ranking universities,
high school students, more than middle school students,
concentrate almost exclusively on gaining good marks and
excellent grades, even if their teachers emphasize the
importance of students’ interest and the learning process. In
contrast, 8th grade students probably focus on studentcentered or motivational and emotional perspectives such as
relationship, constructivist, and interest.
This finding is consistent with previous work showing that
middle school students showed higher course interest and
motivational factors such as self-efficacy and goal
orientation than high school students (Bong, 2003)
I explored two models. The first model assumes direct
effects of perspectives on good instruction on course
satisfaction and academic achievement. The second model
incorporates the direct effects of the first model and indirect
effect of perspectives on good instruction on academic
achievement mediated by course satisfaction. The main
variables related moderately to course satisfaction were
transmission and product perspectives and to academic
achievement were constructivist and product perspective.
Course satisfaction had the highest correlations with
academic achievement. Results of structural equation
modeling based on these two hypotheses showed that
perspectives on good instruction had direct effects on course
satisfaction and academic achievement and indirectly
affected academic achievement mediated by course
satisfaction simultaneously. These results appeared a similar
pattern to previous studies (Tuckman, 200; Zemelman,
Danieksm, & Hyde,1998) and demonstrated that the effect
of course interest differentiated across students’ perception
on teaching and also course interest had direct impact on
academic achievement(So, 2006).
The present findings have educational implications.
Teachers should take into consideration the students’
perspectives on instruction which should be considered at
both middle and high school levels to increase course
satisfaction comprised of learning environment, teaching
method and motivational support and academic achievement.
For instance, teachers striving for good instruction should
use clear and easy teaching methods for effective content
transmission and effective strategies to assist students to
gain a good understanding of the subject contents and to
obtain high scores for high school students. Teachers have
to design a classroom environment based on students’
interest and spontaneous involvement for middle school
students.
The present research had several limitations and poses
directions for future research. The present data were
collected from middle and high schools without classifying
concrete graders and various subjects. Longitudinal
investigations should be conducted to analyze perspectives
on good instruction across grade levels, multiple school
years and multiple subjects. I tested two hypothesized

models. Future research needs to examine various
hypothesized models constructed based on instruction
theories and previous research.
