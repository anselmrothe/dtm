                           Definitions
A graph G = (V, E) is composed of a set of nodes V and a set
of edges E ⊆ V ×V , with |V | = n and |E| = m. A way between
two nodes u and v is any sequence of edges (e1 , e2 , . . . , ek )
with e1 = (u, x1 ), e2 = (x1 , x2 ), . . . , ek = (xk−1 , v). A path is a
way with no repeating nodes. The length of a way is defined
as the number of edges in it. A shortest path between two
