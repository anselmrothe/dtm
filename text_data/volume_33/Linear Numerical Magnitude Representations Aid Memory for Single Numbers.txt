Working Memory Account
   There are at least two potential explanations for age-
related improvements in children’s memory. The first
proposal is that numerical information is better retained as
children age because children’s working memory also                  Figure 1. Depiction of a logarithmically-compressed mental

Numerical estimation We first examined development of
numerical estimation by measuring age-related changes in
accuracy of number line estimates. Accuracy of estimates
was indexed by percent absolute error (PAE), defined as:
