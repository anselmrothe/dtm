   Question 3 attempted to curb this tendency by ensuring
that both attributes were of equal importance, and a trade-
off was required across attributes. The scenario from Q2
was modified into a choice between two managerial
candidates, thereby increasing the natural importance of
human relations candidate scores. In addition, the
participants were told that “both attributes are very
important.” Finally, the difference between the two
candidates’ scores was made more extreme to increase the
perceived difference between them.
