Abstract: How the brain processes pattern mixtures is not well understood. The prevailing views are 1) that difficult
tasks are processed in serial, and easy tasks in parallel 2) in fast image presentations with effective masking leaves
little time for re-entrant neural dynamics other than feed-forward, excluding the possibility of top-down processing.
We hypothesize that to process pattern mixtures, the brain creates an internal copy which we call reconstruction. This
reconstruction process displays difficulty with similarity and asymmetry effects. Our model predicts that Similarity
and asymmetry effects should also occur with fast backwards masking 1) indicating neither a strictly parallel nor
serial structure 2) suggests that top-down reconstruction occurs even with fast masks because the brain is processing
the target and mask as a mixture.
