                   Visual World Study
Tily et al. (2008) conducted a visual world eye-tracking ex-
periment capable of tapping into very early and fine-grained
expectations built up during sentence comprehension. Partic-
ipants were looking at visual stimuli with depictions of the
agent, recipient and theme of the sentence they were listen-
ing to simultaneously. Using verbs that either had a double
object or prepositional object bias they found that partici-
pants were sensitive to the statistic information conveyed by
the verbs. Anticipatory eye-movements (Altmann & Kamide,
1999) towards the depiction of the first argument arrived reli-
ably earlier when it was compatible with the argument order
suggested by the verb bias (Tily et al., 2008). The expecta-
tion effect showed up even at the second argument, where an-
imacy information already could have disambiguated the ar-          screen, the recipient and theme appeared at the bottom, their
guments’ thematic role as recipient (animate) or theme (inan-       position (left or right) was cross-balanced over all trials. At
