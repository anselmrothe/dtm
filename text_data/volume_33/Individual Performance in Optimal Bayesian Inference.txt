and their relatively high degree of success in making
predictions about unknown parameters, might serve as the
ideal place to test the power of iterated learning beyond
tightly-controlled experiments. Making use of our
individual capacity to perform optimal statistical inference
could dramatically improve collective prediction making,
and consequently our ability to make decisions in uncertain
conditions. After all, the intelligence of crowds depends
solely upon the intelligent individuals that constitute them.

Figure 3. Red circles are question values (t) vs. subjects’ responses (ttotal). Solid blue lines represent true optimal prediction
curves for the real-world data. Dashed grey lines represent best-fit curves for experimental data. For normally-distributed
data, the optimal prediction curve has no simple analytic form, so we fit a cubic polynomial as an approximation. Optimal
prediction curves for the other 3 distributions are linear, so we fit lines for these distributions.
