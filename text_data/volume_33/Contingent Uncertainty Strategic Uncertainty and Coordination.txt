Abstract: Uncertainty about the coordination of common efforts (e.g. team projects, alliances) often coexists with
uncertainty about other variables (e.g. weather, market fluctuations, political instability). In certain coordination
games in which equilibria can potentially arise at any common effort level, ex ante equilibrium selection (particularly
of high-effort, high-payoff equilibria) has been a persistent game theoretical challenge. This is largely due to the
strategic uncertainty of each participant about the behavior of others, in the absence of communication and credible
commitment. We performed experiments in which exogenous noise was added to the decisions of participants in
a minimum-effort coordination game. Results indicate that this added contingent uncertainty can prevent perfect
coordination at the lowest-payoff equilibrium, and thus make coordination at higher-payoff equilibria possible.
