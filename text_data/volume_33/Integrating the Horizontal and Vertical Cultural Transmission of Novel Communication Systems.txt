if it could be shown that horizontal transmission resulted in
a communication system with all the crucial features of
language, the story cannot end there – the communication
system must be transmitted beyond the closed set of
individuals who developed it, and work has shown that this
is far from straightforward (Galantucci, Theisen, Gutierrez,
Kroos, & Rhodes, in press). Similarly, even if it could be
shown that vertical cultural transmission resulted in a
communication system with all the crucial features of
language, the story cannot begin there – unless we want to
assume that one individual invented a communication
system on his own and transmitted it to the next generation,
we must allow that horizontal transmission shaped at least
the beginning of language. In addition, it is clear that in the
real world, generations are not neatly divided and
populations are not static, so both processes are undoubtedly
in operation.
