                          Introduction
When should a radiologist stop searching for abnormalities
on your X-Rays? How long should an airport baggage screen-
ing officer search through your bag? Searching for important
objects in clutter is a ubiquitous real-world task, which has
been most systematically studied in vision (see Nakayama
& Martini, 2010, for a review). The bulk of this literature
focuses on search for a single target (e.g., looking for your
keys); however, some of the most important real-world vi-
sual search tasks (e.g., those conducted by radiologists, bag-
gage screeners, and military personnel) are multiple-target                Figure 1: A sample search array. All displays contained 40 items,

Figure 4: (A) The time spent searching after finding the last target found in a particular display, plotted as a function of the number of targets
found (not necessarily all the targets present) for each condition. The value for 4 targets is not plotted for the 75% condition, as fewer than
half the participants in this condition found 4 targets in a single display. (B) Predictions of a Bayesian ideal observer. When 0 targets have
been found, observers in the 75% condition have cause for optimism, and are expected to search for a long time before stopping; while those
in the 25% condition should be pessimistic about the prospects of the display containing any targets at all. However, once a target has been
found, these expectations reverse: the observers in the 75% condition should not expect to find any more targets, while observers in the 25%
condition should expect to find many more. This should result in participants in the 25% condition searching longer for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
target, etc. (C) Potential Value theorem model results with an optimal Bayesian value threshold. (D) Model results assuming only partial
