Abstract: The involvement of emotion in lexical processing has gained substantial attention, with many studies
showing differential processing of words with negative emotional content. It is unknown, however, whether these
interactions are restricted to conscious perception, or extend to preconscious processing as well. Here we examine
the role of emotional content on preconscious face and word processing, taking advantage of interocular suppression
to render a stimulus invisible for a short duration, and using an orthogonal spatial task (location discrimination) to
identify the time at which a stimulus emerges from visual suppression. Crucially, consistent patterns were observed
for emotional content across modality: negative stimuli (angry faces and negative words) took longer to emerge
than positively valenced stimuli (happy faces and positive words). We discuss how differences in task demands can
produce apparently incompatible patterns of results, and show how these different results can be reconciled within
attentional accounts of negativity bias.
