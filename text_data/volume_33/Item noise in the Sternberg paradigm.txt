Abstract
The list length effect in recognition memory is the finding
that performance improves as the number of items studied decreases. Models have attempted to operationalize interference
in recognition memory as noise that accumulates over items
in the study list, other contexts in which studied items have
appeared, or a combination of both sources. Item noise models predict a list length effect. The list length effect has been
eliminated in long-term recognition tasks. We demonstrate that
the length effect may also be eliminated in short-term recognition (the Sternberg paradigm) if a filled delay is introduced.
List length and recency effects were eliminated following an
engaging 15 second distractor task. Articulatory suppression
invoked the same results at a 2 second delay.

Introduction
Global-matching models of recognition memory propose that
a test probe is compared to every item on the study list, and
familiarity is summed over all items. As such, each new item
introduces additional noise. Item-noise accounts predict a
list length effect in which recognition performance decreases
as a function of the number of items studied. Context-noise
models suggest that the list length effect in a long-term setting derives from confounding factors that are not inherent to
the studied items themselves. Null length effects have been
found by introducing a delay between study and test. The
delay encourages reinstatement of the study list context as a
unit rather than referencing the end-of-list context to assess
familiarity. The delay also equates the overall time before
test to eliminate the retention interval confound (Dennis &
Humphreys, 2001). Because shorter lists may be rehearsed
more completely during any delay, the delay must be filled
with a distractor task (Dennis Lee & Kinnell, 2008).
If set size is the driving source of interference, the latency
to respond to items in a short-term recognition task should
increase with list length. Saul Sternberg (1966) established a
paradigm for observing list length effects in short-term memory. Study lists were comprised of 1 to 6 digits presented for
1.2 seconds (s) each. There was a 2 s, unfilled delay between
study and test. At test, one number was presented and participants pulled a lever to indicate that the number had been
seen in the preceding list. Sternberg found that latency for
both distractors and targets increases linearly with set size,
and concluded that retrieval occurs via an exhaustive serial

scan. Exhaustive serial scanning, however, cannot account
for null list length effects (Townsend & Fifić, 2003).
Recency has been purported to induce list length effects in
a short-term paradigm (Monsell, 1978; McElree & Dosher,
1989). The recency hypothesis is concurrent with the Sternberg paradigm only when the delay between study and test
is relatively short. Monsell, for example, tested lengths 1
through 4 after a 0.1 s delay (1978). When the delay is greater
than 2 seconds, the effect of recency is diminished (Forrin &
Cunningham, 1973; Jensen & Lisman, 1998); yet, Sternberg
(1966) found list length effects after a 2 s delay. Moreover,
Sternberg (1969) identified primacy but not recency following 2.5 s of rehearsal. Participants exhibited a range of serial position results from flat functions to strong primacy effects. Sternberg hypothesized that individual differences may
reflect starting strategies in scanning. In particular, rehearsal
may induce a circular scan that begins with the last item rehearsed (Sternberg, 1969).
The original Sternberg paradigm included a serial recall
task following each study-test block (Sternberg, 1966). Duncan & Murdock (2000) found an interaction between intentionality and serial position for a mixed recognition-recall
paradigm with a 1 s study-test delay. Each study list was randomly assigned to either a recall or recognition test. When
participants were pre-cued, there was a clear recency effect
in the recognition task trials. However, when post-cued, the
recognition serial position function was flat. A questionnaire
confirmed that participants prepared for recall in the absence
of cue. The results suggest that the recall portion of the Sternberg paradigm may have confounded the recency results by
inducing task-specific encoding or rehearsal strategies.
The current research aims to disambiguate factors underlying list length findings in the Sternberg paradigm and to determine if, as in long-term paradigms, it is possible to eliminate
the length effect. Such a result would undermine item-noise
accounts and would suggest that short- and long-term memory are not subsumed by fundamentally different systems.

Experiment 1
The main objectives of Experiment 1 were to both replicate
and eliminate the list length effect in the Sternberg paradigm
(1966). The study-test delay was increased from 2 s to 15
s to encourage contextual reinstatement and reduce recency
effects. To counter the confounding effects of rehearsal, the
15 s delay was filled with a distractor task and serial recall

the Python-Experiment Programming Library (PyEPL).
Words were presented to the center of the screen for 1.2
s each. At the end of study, there was a 2 s delay followed
by 0.5 s of fixation preceding the test item. Participants were
allotted 2.7 s to respond. When a response was registered, the
math portion began. Each of the 8 problems was presented at
fixed intervals of 1.875 seconds for a total filler period of 15
s. A 1 s delay and 0.5 s fixation interval signaled the start of
the next study block. In the delayed condition, the first of 8
math problems appeared on the screen immediately following
study. Then there was a 2 s delay followed by a 0.5 s fixation
period and lastly the test probe. Then followed 1 s delay and
0.5 s fixation interval before the next cycle.

Method
Participants Participants were 76 undergraduate students
enrolled in an introductory psychology course at The Ohio
State University. Participants selected this experiment to fulfill a partial-credit course requirement and all provided informed consent. The 2 s delay condition included 19 women
and 20 men averaging 19.63 years in age. The 15 s delay
condition included 20 women and 17 men with a mean age of
19.39 years.
Materials Stimuli were lists of length 1 through 6, composed of 5-, 6-, and 7-letter low-frequency (1-4 Google
counts per million) and high-frequency (100-200 counts)
words. Each of 6 stimuli groups was composed of 68 words.
An additional 26 words drawn from mid-frequency ranges
(42-62 counts) were presented during the practice portion of
the experiment. Distractor words were drawn from the same
stimuli pool as test words, but did not appear in any iterations of the experiment. Math questions were randomly generated addition/subtraction problems using a combination of
two digits. Half the problems were incorrect by one numeric
interval. An example of a math question would be: 9 - 7 = 3
(Q = Yes / P = No). The same stimuli were used betweensubjects across conditions.

Results
The list length results for Experiment 1 are presented in Figure 11 . Participants with d0 < 0.9 were eliminated. An
ANOVA revealed a non-significant interaction of length by
delay, F(5, 370) = 0.928, p = 0.462. A linear regression was
run on each condition. The regression assessed the average of
the median RTs across all positions for each length per participant. In the 2 s delayed condition, the slope was statistically
significantly greater than zero: t = 4.458, p < 0.001. The
trend in the 15 s delay condition was also statistically significant: t = 2.852, p < 0.01.
Length by RT

Design
The within-subjects factors of Experiment 1 were the length
of the study list and the serial position of the test item. The
between-subjects factor was the study-test delay. The dependent measure was response time (RT). There were 6 levels of
length and 2 levels of delay (2 s unfilled and 15 s filled).

Procedure Each serial position of each list was probed an
equal number of times for a total of 21 position by length
combinations. Each iteration of Experiment 1 included 21
trials with target probes and also 21 distractor trials. The experiment was divided into two sessions, each containing twoiterations. In sum there were 4 observations of each length by
position combination per participant. Sessions ranged from
2-7 days apart. The same stimuli were used in both sessions,
but the order of individual stimuli, list lengths, and probe positions were randomized between days. Words were combined and shuffled within frequency-type for each iteration.
Participants were seated at individual desks separated by
partitions. Up to 8 participants were tested at once. Participants were instructed to remember a list of study words for a
test where they must indicate whether a word was studied in
the prior list or was completely novel (Q = Old / P = New).
The 15 s math task appeared in both conditions (either between or after each study-test cycle) to equate overall testing
time. Participants were informed of when the math test would
appear, and were instructed to respond both accurately and
quickly on all tasks. Response times were logged utilizing

not evident in either data set. Recency results for the 2 second unfilled delay and the 15 second delay with distractor are

Discussion
The Sternberg findings were successfully replicated; however, instantiating a 15 s delay is not sufficient to induce a null
length effect. Interestingly, however, recency effects were not
found in the 2 s delay condition despite increases in latency
as a function of length. In this instance, recency alone does
not capture the short-term list length effect.

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 was designed to determine if the 15 s distractor task was sufficiently engaging to reduce rehearsal. The
distractor task was modified to be self-paced with feedback.

Method
Participants Participants were 36 undergraduate students
enrolled in an introductory psychology course at The Ohio
State University. Participants selected this experiment to fulfill a partial-credit course requirement and all provided informed consent. The 2 s delay condition included 11 women

and 7 men averaging 21.44 years in age. There were 6 women
and 12 men with a mean age of 20.11 years in the ∼15 s delay
condition.
Materials Materials were lists of lengths 2, 4, and 6 composed of 5-, 6-, and 7-letter low-frequency (1-4 Google
counts per million) and high-frequency (100-200 counts)
words. There were a total of 190 words (including 22, midfrequency practice words).
Procedure The stimuli were randomized and repeated at
one-week intervals. List lengths were reduced from 6 to 3
but observations per position were increased from 4 to 6 to
reduce error in the recency analyses. There were 12 position
by length list combinations. Each of the 12 types was tested
in pure high-frequency and pure low-frequency cycles such
that one iteration contained 24 target trials and 24 distractor
trials.
The experiment was completed in 3 (single iteration) sessions for a total of 6 observations per positive probe position.
The study-test lag was filled with math problems identical
in form to the previous experiment. However, the task was
self-paced and include feedback (Correct / Wrong). 16 math
questions were presented for up to 1.875 seconds each. The
total possible time was 30 seconds; but, on average, the delay
was approximately 15 seconds.

Results
The list length results for Experiment 2 are presented in
Figure 41 . Participants with d0 < 0.9 were eliminated.

greater than zero: t = 3.272, p < 0.01. Critically, the slope
in the ∼15 s delay condition was not statistically significantly
different from zero: t = 0.63, p = 0.531.

A linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the
recency effects. RTs were combined such that the medians for
positions 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 were averaged for each participant.
The results for combined positions across each length in the 2
s delay condition are as follows: t(4) = 0.163, p = 0.871; t(6)
= 0.549, p = 0.586. The results for the ∼15 s delay condition
are: t(4) = 0.305, p = 0.762; t(6) = 0.248, p = 0.805. Serial
position graphs for the 2 s unfilled delay and the ∼15 s filled
delay are presented in Figures 5 and 61 .

Discussion
It appears that a null list length effect is possible in a Sternberg paradigm when the design includes both a longer studytest lag and a sufficiently engaging distractor task. As with
Experiment 1, recency effects do not appear to underly the
list length effects.

Experiment 3
A potential caveat of Experiment 2 was that increasing the
study-test delay actually shifted the paradigm from short-term
memory to a long-term task. The purpose of Experiment 3 is
to examine the extent to which null length effects hold at a

Participants Participants were 44 undergraduate students
enrolled in an introductory psychology course at The Ohio
State University. Participants selected this experiment to fulfill a partial-credit course requirement and all provided informed consent. The 2 s delay included 11 women and 11
men averaging 18.59 years in age. Participants in the 2 s delay with suppression were 10 women and 12 men with a mean
age of 19.27 years.
Materials Word stimuli were identical to those used in Experiment 2. The distractor task was modified such that a
single number between 10,000 and 90,000 appeared on the
screen for 2 s. The five digits were random integers presented
without commas.
Procedure The experiment was completed in one session
that contained 3 iterations. Each iteration consisted of 24 target trials and 24 distractor trials. There were 6 observations
of each probe position per participant. The study-test delay
was 2 s in both conditions. The delay in the manipulation
condition was filled with an articulatory suppression task to
prevent subvocal rehearsal.
In addition to the standard instruction (to remember a list of
study words and respond yes/no to a single test word), participants were informed that digits would appear and they should
quickly and accurately say the digits aloud as a number. Par-

Results

Discussion

The list length results for Experiment 3 are presented in
Figure 71 . Participants with d0 < 0.9 were eliminated.
An ANOVA revealed a statistically significant interaction of
length by delay, F(2, 84) = 8.0441, p < 0.001. A linear regression assessed the average of the median RTs across combined positions (1-2, 3-4, and 5-6) for each length per participant. In the 2 s delayed condition, the slope was statistically
significantly greater than zero: t = 2.656, p < 0.001. In the 2
s articulatory suppression condition, the slope was not statistically significantly different from zero: t = 0.457, p = 0.649.
Recency trends were conducted on the average of median
RTs for combined positions for each given length. The results
are as follows for each position in the 2 s delay condition: t(4)
= -1.267, p = 0.212; t(6) = -0.726, p = 0.471. The results
for the suppression condition are: t(4) = -0.774, p = 0.443;
t(6) = -1.789, p = 0.0783. The articulatory suppression linear
trends approach significance statistically, which may indicate
that recency is a factor to consider. However, recency effects
would be surprising given the null list length effect. The recency results for the 2 s unfilled delay and the 2 s delay with
articulatory suppression are presented in Figures 8 and 91 .

Results demonstrate that a null list length effect is observed
at a 2 s delay in which rehearsal is prevented. When rehearsal

Sternberg’s concept of forgetting as a function of set size informed exemplar-based recognition memory models. Here,
we elucidate features underlying forgetting in a short-term
memory task. Evidence for the null list length effect in both
short- and long-term memory underscores continuity between
the two classifications of memory. The results suggest that
study items themselves are not predictive of length and recency trends across recognition memory. In no case does the
list length effect appear to be a clear consequence of item interference. When there are list length effects, the causes are
likely due to various confounds: (1) recency in immediate
tests; (2) serial rehearsal in recall-oriented tasks; and (3) rehearsal when either a 2 s or 15 s delay does not include an
engaging distractor task.
The impact of short-term rehearsal on recency is a topic
that merits further exploration. It is possible that rehearsal
eliminates recency at short delays (Kahana & Loftus, 1999),
and that at longer delays recency is eliminated even when rehearsal is reduced. If the recency effects in the articulatory
suppression condition were statistically significant, it would
suggest that both study-test lag and relative temporal distinctiveness contribute to the short-term memory trace (Morin
Brown & Lewandowsky, 2010).
Alternatively, the nature of contextual representation could
shift over the course of study-test delay. Rehearsal may re-

duce the extent to which the studied context, as a unit, may
be reinstated. Similar to the concept of circular scanning
(Sternberg, 1969), rehearsal may perturb the positional markers of the study-list context in short delays. Over longer time
frames, the distinctiveness of serial position information may
be offset by accumulating contextual noise that arises during
the study-test lag. These results suggest that both delay and
rehearsal function in consort to predict serial position and list
length trends. It seems conclusive that there is continuity in
the relative contribution of item-interference across short and
long-term memory – specifically that item interference alone
is not explicative of forgetting in recognition memory.
