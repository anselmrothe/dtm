a list of pre-scripted descriptions matching their cards in

assistants of the same age and population who were trained
to act as participants. Participants and confederates took
turns in blocks of four trials describing the routes on the
cards. Confederates also spoke first, ensuring that their
utterances (primes) preceded those of the participants on
target trials. Participants were instructed to describe the
routes on their cards and to pay attention to both their maps
and their partner’s maps as they would do a test on map

Results and Discussion
In this study, participants described the first set of cards and
the priming by confederate description only occurred
afterwards. Thus, the mean % use of route perspective on
this initial block was treated as an individual baseline for
each participant and the degree to which subsequent priming
affected their responses was calculated on the basis of
subtracting these individual baseline averages from the
mean % route perspective used on the third (middle) and
fifth (last) block of cards (after the confederate primes on
the second and fourth blocks).
