assume the presence of such a mechanism. However, as ar-
gued earlier, it is not likely that simulations are formed (at
least beyond a rudimentary proto-simulation) as a result of
an evolutionary process. This implies that simulations must
be formed (or significantly refined) during the lifetime of the
human. Further, according to simulation theory, these simu-
lations are important to cognition and should therefore form
at the earliest opportunity.
    Additionally, the phenomenological content of dreams can
in general have further useful consequences for simulation
processes employed when awake (e.g. solve problems).
Firstly, dreams are somewhat more unconstrained than other
thought processes, e.g. dream imagery is often more bizarre
than wake thoughts, self-reflection is absent in dreams, and
dreams lack orientational stability (Hobson et al., 2000).
Thus, dreaming allows the emergence of paths of simulated
actions and perceptions that would not, by some mechanism,
have been thought of while awake. Secondly, dreams might
be useful for creating longer and more stable simulations as
they contain several organising aspects. Dreams integrate             Figure 1: Schematic of the hypothesised relation between
