Experimental Setup
   The stimuli were displayed at a resolution of 1024 x 768
pixels on a 20“ CRT monitor. The screen refresh rate was
100 Hz. Participants sat in front of the monitor at a distance
of ~60 cm, such that the resulting visual angle of the
monitor was 37 degrees (horizontally) x 28 degrees
(vertically). Eye movements were recorded using a SR

using a chin rest. The eye-tracker was calibrated using a 9-
point grid. A second 9-point grid was used to calculate the
accuracy of the calibration. Fixations were defined using the
detection algorithm supplied by SR Research.
Analysis Gaze Behavior
   For each stimulus two interest areas equally dividing the
image in a left part and a right part were defined. Fixations       Figure 3: Response time decreases from experimental block
