ER supports visual processing. The perception of
individuals without ASD will be less dependant on the ERs
ability to enable visual processing.
Hypothesis 3:
Young people with ASD will show a strong preference for
ERs that enhance spatial reasoning, whereas ERs that
restrain visual processing will be least preferred. These
preferences will be different or less distinctive in individuals
without ASD.
To address these hypotheses we conducted an ER card sort
task. By means of this task, participants’ perception of
similarity and dissimilarity of ERs and their ER knowledge
structure can be made explicit. Card sorts have been used as
a technique for eliciting and structuring expert knowledge
(e.g. Schreiber et al, 1999). Using card sorts, Minshew et al.
(2002) suggest that there are differences in category
formation in ASD.

Data collection
The clusters participants created were recorded along with
the cluster’s name, as well as the representations in each
cluster (using the relevant card number from reverse).
Additionally, participants’ ratings of how easily the ERs
within a cluster could be understood, and the most and least
liked ER, were also noted.

From participants’ card sorts a similarity matrix for each

Preferences
Participants were asked to identify an ER that they liked
most and one they liked least out of the 40 stimuli, and to
give a reason why. During this task, 5 participants within
the ASD group were unable to identify a preferred ER.
Also, one participant within the non-ASD and 6 participants
in the ASD group failed to identify a representation that
they liked least.
