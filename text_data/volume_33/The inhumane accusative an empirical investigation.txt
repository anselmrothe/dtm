Abstract: Leo Weisgerber (1957/58) made the much debated claim that in German referring to human beings via
a direct (accusative) object where an indirect (dative) object paraphrase would be available is an inhumane choice,
since it entails subtly depersonalizing the referent: Dative use implies ascribing human characteristics to referents,
accusative use amounts to degrading them to mere objects. Assuming that agentivity and mental experience in action
are salient human characteristics, Weisgerberâ€™s claim fits nicelly with the dative and accusative object prototypes
proposed by Langacker (1991): A dative object suggests an active experiencer, an accusative object an inanimate
thing. In his cognitive model of German cases, Smith (1985) observed also a difference in action participation between
these personal objects. We used a priming experiment to test the hypothesis that persons introduced via dative as
opposed to accusative objects are more readily perceived as highly agentive and mentally involved.
