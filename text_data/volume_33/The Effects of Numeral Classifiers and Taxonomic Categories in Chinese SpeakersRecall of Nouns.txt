adopted the ratio of repetition (RR) as an indicator of
subjective clustering. RR was defined as the “fraction
representing the number of repetitions of items divided by
the total item listed” (Bousfield, 1953), given by the
equation in (1). Frender and Doubilet (1974) further
suggested that the clustering tendency can be efficiently

                       Experiment 2
Experiment 2 employed the same stimuli as Experiment 1,
but differed in the way items were presented to the
participants. Items of the same category were presented in
the same column, and a linguistic label of their shared
category was placed right above the column. For C-Nouns,
the labels were the shared classifiers among category
members, and for T-Nouns, the labels were taxonomic
nodes that properly expressed the commonalities among
category members. By labeling the nature of each category,
we aimed to examine whether taxonomic and classifier
categories would be equally activated for object
organization when made explicit to the participants.
