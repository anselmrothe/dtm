this domain do not lend themselves to explicitly measuring
coordination. This is because the choice of stimuli is likely
to bias the perceptual system to focus either on local
elements (e.g., when the elements highly salient) or on
global patterns (e.g., when small elements form highly
salient patterns). Such methods are ideal to measure possible
interferences of hierarchical scales, but they might miss the
adaptive coordination that takes place when scales of
hierarchical organizations interact. We therefore turn to a
different method, one that can gauge a possible coordination
among the many nested levels of order.
Coordination across Scales
Changes in the mind-body system happen at different rates
or scales. The metabolic activity in a motor cell, for
example, is a process changing on very fast timescales; and
