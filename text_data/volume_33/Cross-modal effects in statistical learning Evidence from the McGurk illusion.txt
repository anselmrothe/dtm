Abstract: Statistical learning is assumed to play a vital role in language acquisition, yet it is unknown whether
it is guided by a unitary, modality-general mechanism, or by several sensory-specific mechanisms. Consistent with
the latter view, Seitz et al (2007) tested learners with multimodal input and found that statistical learning in one
modality is independent of input to other modalities. We tested this assertion of independence by presenting learners
with speech streams synchronized with a video of a speakerâ€™s face. We used the McGurk illusion to manipulate the
underlying statistical structure of the speech streams. Contrasting the independence hypothesis, our results suggest
that participants can integrate audio and visual input to perceive the McGurk illusion during statistical learning,
thereby altering the pattern of segmentation. Our results suggest that auditory and visual inputs are not processed
independently, but leave unresolved whether the resulting representations are integrated across modalities or not.
