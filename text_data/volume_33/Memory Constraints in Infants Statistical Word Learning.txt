Abstract: Recent research indicates that infants use statistical learning to map linguistic labels to objects in the
world (Smith & Yu, 2008). Here, we extend this work by examining how statistical word learning may be constrained
or facilitated by memory development. Two groups of infants, 16- and 20-month-olds, were presented with a crosssituational word learning task. Half of the object-label pairings occurred in immediate succession and the other half
of pairings were separated in time. We observed developmental differences in the ability to track, aggregate, and
infer associations across time: 16-month-olds were able to learn pairings presented in immediate succession whereas
20-month-olds were able learn pairings both in immediate succession and across time. Results are discussed in terms
of implications for theories of statistical learning, memory, and language and cognitive development.
