Consider the following real-life decisions that we make:
deciding which route to take home to minimize time spent
traveling, choosing amongst a set of known restaurants or a
new restaurant when dining out, deciding between reading
a new book by a consistently good author versus an author
whose books vary widely in quality. All of these decisions
involve balancing the conflicting demands of exploiting previous knowledge in order maximize payoffs versus exploring less-known options in order to gain information about
the currently optimal course of action. Indeed, successfully
balancing these competing demands is a non-trivial problem
of interest to artificial intelligence and neural Reinforcement
Learning (RL) research communities alike (Cohen, McClure,
& Yu, 2007; Daw et al., 2006; Sutton & Barto, 1998). There
are adverse consequences for failing to properly balance these
demands in the above examples: solely making exploitative choices entails the possibility of ignorance about better
courses of action, while exploring too frequently incurs large
opportunity costs. The goal of the proposed symposium is
to bring together researchers from a variety of perspectives
who are working to better understand the psychological and
neurobiological mechanisms underlying exploratory choice.
In recent years, novel computational modeling approaches
have been developed and applied to understanding how humans incorporate the demands of information gathering into
their patterns of choice. These modeling techniques have
yielded insight not only in describing human choice behavior, but also in understanding the neurobiological and physiological correlates of exploratory decision-making in humans
(Daw et al., 2006; Jepma & Niewenhuis, in press). The researchers who have agreed to participate in this symposium
are all applying computational models to better understand
the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning peoples negotiation of the exploration-exploitation
tradeoff. The modeling approaches taken by these speakers
are indeed diverse, ranging from uncovering hidden variables
underlying decision-makers’ choices in order to unpack neu-

robiological and physiological measurements to describing
aging-related changes in exploratory choice behavior. The
proposed symposium will provide a forum for highlighting
recent advances in applications of computational modeling to
human exploratory choice.
The speakers who have agreed to participate in this
symposium–while each performing research that elucidates
psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying
exploratory decision-making—offer different perspectives on
the issue. The research described includes 1) aging work
examining lifespan changes in exploratory decision-making,
elucidating the underlying neurobiology of these types of
choices (Worthy & Maddox), 2) a Bayesian account of effect
of novelty–when humans are presented with new, potentially
rewarding options–on exploratory choice, and how these novelty signals are represented in the brain in order to compute
values and guide choices (Gershman & Niv), 3) how individuals incorporate uncertainty and information search costs when
planning courses of action in situations with sequential dependencies between choices and outcomes (Hotaling, Busemeyer, & Shiffrin), and 4) how internally calculated uncertainty about the environment directs exploratory choice and
manifests itself physiologically over the course of decisionmaking (Otto, Knox, & Love). In addition to proposing answers to a diverse set of important psychological and neuroscientific questions, the lines of research described by these
speakers rely upon laboratory tasks with monetary incentives
that, each in their own way, incorporate ecologically interesting choice and reward dynamics.
Belief-directed Exploration in Human Decision-Makers:
Behavioral and Physiological Evidence A Ross Otto, W.
Bradley Knox, & Bradley C. Love
Decision-making in uncertain environments poses a conflict between the goals of exploiting past knowledge in order to maximize rewards and exploring less-known options in
order to gather information. However, the descriptive modeling framework utilized in previous studies of exploratory
choice behavior characterizes exploration as the result of
choices, rather than a process reflecting beliefs and/or un-

certainty about the environment. This work presents an
Ideal Actor model that prescribes an optimal incremental
belief-update procedure and payoffs-maximizing pattern of
choice in a novel decision-making task. By comparing human choice dynamics to those prescribed by the Ideal Observer/Actor, I evaluate the notion that people conduct exploration in a belief-directed fashion. Further, I reveal how hidden, internally calculated beliefs are indexed by pre-choice
autonomic arousal (measured using skin conductance) and
choice reaction times in the course of decision-making, providing evidence that people indeed negotiate the explorationexploitation choice tradeoff in a belief-directed fashion. This
model-based analysis provides a quantitative analysis of how
uncertainty relates to anticipatory autonomic arousal preceding choices will elucidate the role of autonomic arousal in
risky decision-making, a topic of much debate in the literature.

engaged in more exploration across both tasks, performing
worse in Experiment 1, but better in Experiment 2. Their
data were also fit best by lower exploitation parameter values relative to the data of younger adults. Two additional
experiments were conducted that required the learning of a
hidden, dynamic structure of the reward environment. It was
hypothesized that engaging in a more systematic form of exploration would aide in uncovering the underlying structure
of the environment. Older adults performed more optimally
than younger adults in both of these experiments. We conclude by discussing possible behavioral and neurobiological reasons for these age-based differences along the exploration/exploitation continuum.
Information Search in Multi-Stage Risky DecisionMaking Jared M. Hotaling, Jerome B. Busemeyer, &
Richard M. Shiffrin
Research into risky decision-making has traditionally presented individuals with choice alternatives that provide an
immediate reward or punishment based on the outcome
of a single random event. Decisions are typically made
in isolation, independent from any previous or subsequent
choices. This approach neglects the complexity of everyday
decision-making, which often involves multiple interdependent choices and several uncertain events. We present recent work that extends the traditional risky decision making
paradigm by incorporating some of the complexities of real
world choices. Participants completed a series of multistage
decision trials, represented as branching decision trees. At
decision nodes, participants chose which path to take through
the tree. At chance nodes, a random event determined the
path. Crucially, participants had the option to use some of the
points earned on previous trials to reduce their uncertainty by
purchasing information about chance nodes. We review data
showing how individuals incorporate factors like risk, information search cost, and degree of uncertainty when forming
plans for multistage decision scenarios. Our results show individual differences, with several distinct strategies emerging.
A comparison of multiple competing models is used to elucidate the cognitive processes at work.

Reinforcement Learning, Exploration, and Novelty
Bonuses in the Brain Sam Gershman & Yael Niv
The ”puzzle of novelty” refers to the contradictory observations that humans and animals are both neophobic (repulsed by novelty) and neophilic (attracted to novelty). In an
effort to shed computational light on this puzzle, we have analyzed neotic preferences in terms of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) models. We show mathematically that both neophilia
and neophobia can arise from Bayesian inductive generalization over reward predictions, depending on the reinforcement
history. In essence, the Bayesian RL model regularizes reward predictions for novel actions towards the predictions for
other actions taken in the same context. This model offers
a new perspective on so-called ”novelty bonuses”optimistic
reward predictions that encourage exploration. According to
the Bayesian RL model, the degree of bonus (or penalty) will
depend on experience with other actions in the same context.
We present behavioral and brain imaging evidence consistent
with this model, showing that neural valuation signals are better described by the Bayesian model than by a novelty bonus
model. These findings suggest that human exploratory tendencies are guided by inductive knowledge about the environment.
Effects of Normal Aging on the Resolution of the Exploration/Exploitation Dilemma in Decision-Making Darrell A. Worthy & W. Todd Maddox
We examined how normal aging affects predispositions
toward either exploratory or exploitative choice by having healthy younger and older adults perform two decisionmaking tasks where exploitation (Experiment 1) or exploration (Experiment 2) was the optimal strategy. In both experiments participants performed two variants of the task, one
week apart, where they had to either maximize points gained
or minimize points lost. A reinforcement learning model was
used to directly parameterize the degree to which subjects exploited the options with the largest expected rewards versus
explored options with lower expected rewards. Older adults
