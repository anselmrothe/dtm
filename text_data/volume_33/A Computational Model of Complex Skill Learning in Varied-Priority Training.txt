Hebbian S-R learning
Hebbian learning between the frontal cortex and the
premotor cortex allows fast selection of responses tied to an
environmental stimulus. Unlike learning at the striatum,
Hebbian learning is often independent of the outcome of the
responses, i.e., association is strengthened whenever the
response is selected when the stimulus is perceived. During
initial learning, because the correct S-R rules have not yet
been learned, none of the responses will be activated.
Instead, goal-directed behavior will guide the selection of
the right response. With practice, the correct S-R rules are
strengthened, which allow correct responses to be activated
when the stimuli that tied to them are perceived.
