An Example of Model Predictions
Consider the concept learning game in Figure 1. In this
game, the set of six boats represent the hypothesis space,
and each individual boat represents a possible hypothe-             G

sional concept learning problem (Kemp & Tenenbaum,
2009; Shepard, 1987). In the game, informants choose                H

whether the hidden window is part of the concept (i.e.
is hiding a boat).
