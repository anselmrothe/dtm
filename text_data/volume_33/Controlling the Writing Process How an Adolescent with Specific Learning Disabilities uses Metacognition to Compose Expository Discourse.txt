Abstract: This single subject study concerned how a 13 year-old student with specific learning disabilities used
metacognition as he composed discourse in response to a writing prompt. Ethnographic procedures were used to
collect and analyze data. The participant engaged in a think aloud procedure as he composed a paper about a
famous historical figure. His transcribed verbalizations were analyzed by use of domain and taxonomic analysis for
use of metacognitive strategies.
  Results indicated that the participant organized and controlled the writing process by using the following four do-
mains of metacognitive strategies: (a) planning discourse/thinking, (b) evaluating discourse/thinking, (c) recognizing
problems with discourse/thinking, and (d) repairing discourse/thinking. The participant engaged in knowledge-telling
behavior and focused on surface level text structure to produce a final product at a low abstractive level. Small
sample size prevents generalizations, but other research suggests that particular metacognitive strategies can be
taught to support more successful writing.
