together?

Abstract

binary features (e.g., red and blue, loud and quiet). Assume
the learner is able to keep track of frequencies of encounters
with the different kinds of objects, to fill in something like a
contingency table (see Figure 1). Those frequencies are
informative about both p(red|loud) and p(loud|red). In most
experimental conditions, and perhaps in the real world as
well, experience of the features is sequential. The learner
first observes one feature (“this is red”) and then learns
another (“it is loud”). If color is always observed first, the
learner gets experience making judgments of p(loud|red)
and p(loud|blue). We know from a long history of
experimental psychology that people will soon get good at
estimating these probabilities: They will learn what red and
what blue predict. Will they also learn anything about the
inverse probabilities, p(red|loud) and p(red|quiet)?
Research on category learning suggests that training on
p(A|B) may not produce learning of p(B|A). For example, in
a supervised categorization task, people learn which cues
predict membership in which category, p(category|feature).
However they seem not to learn about the characteristic
properties of the categories, p(feature|category) (see, Taylor
& Ross, 2009). They learn “what predicts category A” but
not “what category A predicts.” Similar results come from
the literature on perceptual learning: People often learn the
discrimination they are trained on, but little else (Ahissar,
1999). In contrast, there is considerable evidence that
learned associations are symmetric (Kahana, 2002). For
example, in paired associates, training A from B also trains
B from A. The literature on the inverse fallacy,
p(disease|symptom) = p(symptom|disease), supports the
hypothesis of symmetry. Although somewhat inconsistent,
these lines of work are not exactly contradictory. If people
confuse (or assume symmetry) of forward and inverse
conditional probabilities then they are not really learning
both at the same time. They learn one, and then infer the
other based on the first. It is one thing to “learn” that p(A|B)
= p(B|A). The more interesting cases involve learning that
the two probabilities are NOT equal.
The focus of the current report is young children’s
learning. One hypothesis is that young children learn
general associations between features, rather than specific
conditional probabilities. For example from experience with
the environments represented in Figure 1, young children
might learn that red “goes with” loud, and blue “goes with”
quiet. They form an overall, gist, impression of the relation
(Reyna & Brainerd, 1994). The key distinction between an
association and a set of conditional probabilities is that
associations are symmetric. The correlation between A and
B is the same as the correlation between B and A. Thus, if

Learning p(A|B) often provides information about p(B|A). Do
learners attend to this information? In Experiment 1,
preschool-aged children learned to predict the sound of an
alien from its color. The predictability of color from sound
did not have a large effect on learning rate. During testing
children seemed to use the learned probabilities,
p(sound|color) to make judgments of the inverses,
p(color|sound) rather than the actual encountered frequency
distribution. In Experiment 2 adults showed a similar pattern.
Adults used the probabilities they were trained on, either
p(sound|color) or p(color|sound), to make judgments of the
inverses. These results support previous demonstration of an
“inverse fallacy” and suggest that both young children and
adults show very task-specific learning.

Many learning problems can be understood in terms of
conditional probabilities. In particular, categorization
involves the probability of class membership given
(conditional upon) possession of some properties. The
inverse of categorization is property projection. In this case
the task is to estimate the probability of some property given
class membership. A categorization problem is, “If
something barks is it likely to be a dog?” A projection
problem is, “If something is a dog is it likely to bark?” The
focus of the current study is the relation between these two
problems, the relation between forward and inverse
conditional probabilities.
In theory there is no particular relation between a forward
conditional probability and its inverse. By itself, that p(A|B)
is high implies almost nothing about p(B|A).
Psychologically the expected relation between these two
quantities is less clear. People often confuse the two
quantities, the so-called “inverse fallacy” (Dawes, Mirels,
Gold, & Donahue, 1993; Villejoubert & Mandel, 2002).
Young children seem to interpret conditional statements (“if
A then B”) as biconditional ("if A then B, and if B then A"
Barrouillet & Lecas, 2002). At the same time, the
categorization literature suggests that people fail to learn
about p(B|A) when trained on p(A|B), even though both
quantities may be estimated from the same experience. The
hypothesis is that learners focus on one predictive problem
to the exclusion of others.
There are many ways to learn conditional probabilities,
but learning from examples seems the most basic. Consider
an environment consisting of objects composed of two

children learn a forward relation between two features (e.g.,
loud things are red) as an association they should expect the
same relation to hold in the inverse (e.g., red things are
loud). In contrast, conditional probabilities need not be
symmetric: p(Loud|Red) ≠ p(Red|Loud). Thus the specific
focus of the current study is the distinction between forward
and inverse conditional probabilities. Are they learned
separately or together? Does learning one automatically
inform people about the other?
Kalish (2010) found that preschool-aged children are
better able to make conditional predictions (e.g., “Is this red
thing loud or quiet?”) given a perfect correlation between
features than given a perfect conditional probability. That is,
children learned “All red things are loud” more easily when
all loud things were also red. Similarly, preschool-aged
children did not distinguish the implications of counter
examples. Encounters with loud blue things led to chancelevel estimates of both p(red|loud) and p(loud|red) (Kalish,
Kim, & Young, 2011). In these tasks, children encountered
both features simultaneously (did not predict one feature
from the other). The experience encouraged learning both
forward and inverse probabilities together. Perhaps when
learning one probability was difficult (because of
inconsistent examples) children had difficulty learning the
other as well. This raises the question of what would
happen if children were trained in one direction only. Would
they learn the inverse as well? And would the reliability of
the inverse affect learning of the forward probability? That
is, is it difficult to learn that p(loud|red) = 1 when
p(red|loud) ≠ 1?

recruited from preschools serving a largely middle-class
population in Madison, WI.
Children were invited to play a computer game about
some space explorers who have discovered aliens on a new
planet. The child’s job was to help the explorers learn about
the aliens. An experimenter led the participant through the
task, reading all text, explaining all pictures, and (usually)
making all responses based on the child’s verbal
instructions. Aliens varied on two binary dimensions: Red
or Blue, and Loud or Quiet. In the Training phase of the
experiment children guessed the sound made by 32 aliens,
16 red and 16 blue. Each trial began with presentation of an
alien paired with two choices (Loud or Quiet). When a child
selected an option they received immediate corrective
feedback: “Right this one is X” or “Wrong, this one is
actually Y”. All red aliens were visually identical, as were
all blue. Aliens were distinguished by number (e.g., “Alien
number 1”). In the Symmetric condition there was a perfect
correlation between color and sound: All red aliens were
loud, and all blue were quiet. In the Partial condition all red
aliens were loud, but half the blue were loud and half were
quiet. Thus there was a perfectly predictive relation for two
features (p(loud|red) and p(blue|quiet) both = 1) but not for
the other two (p(red|loud) = .67 and p(quiet|blue) = .5, see
Figure 1). Order of presentation was randomized within
blocks of 8 trials: Every block of 8 trials had the specified
frequency distribution.
Following the Training phase, children made (and
evaluated) a series of conditional predictions in the Testing
phase. Each trial began with a cartoon image of a child. The
experimenter explained that it was this child’s turn to guess
about the aliens and that the participant could help him/her.
An image representing an alien known to have one feature
(red, blue, loud, quiet) appeared. Participants indicated
what the new child should guess (e.g., loud or quiet for a red
alien). The cartoon child then indicated his/her guess. The
participant then rated the cartoon child’s guess on a 20-point
scale by moving a scroll bar with endpoints labeled
“definitely wrong” to “definitely right”. There were 12

Experiment 1
Methods Forty-two 4- to 5-year-old children (Mean= 4:9,
range 4:0-5:6) participated. Twenty-seven children
participated in the Partial condition, 15 in the Symmetric
condition. More children were included in the Partial
condition because of the expectation that this condition
might prove difficulty. This condition was over-sampled so
non-learners could be excluded if necessary. Children were

conditional predictions: two each of red and blue (the
“forward” predictions), and four each of loud and quiet (the
“inverse” predictions). Cartoon children guessed each
feature half the time (e.g., one child guessed loud given red,
the other blue). These guesses were not contingent on the
participant’s responses. Prediction requests appeared in
random order.

They did recognize that there were loud blue aliens. At least
from these data, the reliability of the inverse did not seem to
affect learning of the forward probability.
In the interests of space, we just consider participants’
evaluations of others’ predictions (and just those
participants who did learn in the Training phase). The
patterns in participants’ own predictions in the Testing
phase were roughly similar. Panel 1 of Figure 2 shows
ratings of “forward” predictions. Children used the relations
in the Training phase to evaluate character’s predictions. In
the Symmetric condition, children thought it was better to
guess Loud than Quiet given Red, and better to guess Quiet
than Loud given Blue. In the Partial condition children also
preferred predictions of Loud given Red, but showed no
preference given Blue.
In the Symmetric condition, children’s ratings of
“inverse” predictions were also consistent with the relations
in the Training phase. They thought a Loud object should
be predicted to be Red, and a Quiet object predicted to be
Blue. In the Partial condition, children thought that Red was
a better guess for a Loud alien than Blue. This preference is
consistent with the conditional probability in the Training
phase, p(red|loud)= .67.
However, children showed no
reliable preference for predictions about Quiet aliens, even
though all the Quiet aliens previously encountered had been
blue. One interpretation of this pattern of results is that
children were not actually learning the inverse conditional
probabilities from experience in the Training phase. Rather,
they only learned the forward conditional probabilities, and
then used those to make inverse predictions. That is,
children learned “red things are loud”, and on that basis,
predicted “loud things would be red.” In the Symmetric
condition they also learned “blue things are quiet” and so
predicted, “quiet things are blue.” In the Partial condition,
children did not learn “blue things are quiet”, so they did not
predict, “quiet things are blue.” Although children made
reliable inverse predictions, the basis for those predictions

Results & Discussion In the Training phase, one relation
was perfectly predictable in both the Symmetric and the
Partial conditions, p(loud|red). Figure 1 presents the mean
proportion of correct predictions that red aliens would be
loud in the training phases, by 8-trial block. Although
children seemed to learn faster in the Symmetric condition,
there were no statistically reliable differences during any
block, or when looking at overall performance. In part, this
null result is due to high variability in children’s learning.
Eleven of the 27 participants averaged below 60% correct in
the Partial condition. In the Symmetric condition, the rate
was six of 15. Some children failed to learn anything. If the
analysis is restricted to learners (>60% correct) then
children in the Symmetric condition outperformed those in
the Partial condition, t(24) = 2.4, p<.05, but only in the
initial block. Overall, the structure of the Partial condition
may have made it slightly more difficult to learn the
predictive relation, but not by much. Children learned
somewhat faster in the Symmetric condition, but there were
no overall differences, and about the same proportion failed
to learn in either condition. These results suggest that
children may be learning p(Loud|Red) independently of
p(Red|Loud). Children learned that p(Loud|Red) was high
despite variation in p(Red|Loud). Note that this effect was
not simply due to children making the inverse fallacy.
Children in the Partial condition guessed randomly for blue
aliens (M = .51 loud predictions). That is, they recognized
that blue aliens could be either loud or quiet. Thus they did
not seem to treat p(Loud|Red) as equal to p(Red|Loud).

seemed to be the forward probabilities they had learned. An
illustration of this result is that the left and right panels of
Figure 2 are very similar. Thus the conclusion is that
children did not learn inverse probabilities from experience
making forward probability judgments.

p(color|sound) sound was forward and p(sound|color)
inverse. Adults participated in the same alien explorer
computer task as did young children in Experiment 1. The
only procedural change from Experiment 1 was that adults
were tested in groups working at individual computers.

Experiment 2

Results & Discussion Figure 3 presents the mean ratings of
others’ guesses. Of interest is whether the direction of
training made a difference. First, participants did learn the
trained forward predictions. In the CtS condition
participants judged predictions of Loud better than Quiet
given Red, but not Blue. In IP predictions of Blue were
better than Red given Quiet, and predictions of Red were
better given Loud. These ratings are consistent with the
actual distributions of exemplars. The same predictions
received significantly different ratings when they appeared
as inverse. While participants in CtS (forward) recognized
that Loud or Quiet were equally good predictions about a
Blue alien, participants in StC (inverse) rated Quiet as a
significantly better prediction. The rating of predictions for
Blue aliens differed significantly between conditions, t(29)
= 4.89, p<.001. Similarly, in StC (forward) participants
preferred a guess of Red given Loud, but recognized that
Blue was plausible. In contrast, CtS participants (inverse)
exaggerated the difference and rated Blue as a poor guess.
Ratings of predictions for Loud aliens differed in the two
conditions, t(29) = 6.98, p<.001.
The adults’ pattern is roughly consistent with children’s
from Experiment 1. In both cases participants seemed to
learn the forward conditional probabilities and use those to
estimate inverse conditional probabilities. Adults in CtS
learned that red aliens were loud (forward). They then
judged that loud things would be red (inverse). Adults in
StC learned that quiet things were blue (forward). They then
judged that blue things would be quiet (inverse).

Young children seemed to learn the conditional
probabilities they were trained on but not the inverse
probabilities. Would adults learn both? We expected ceiling
performance from adults in the Symmetric condition, thus
Experiment 2 presented two conditions involving the Partial
distribution. The “Color-to-Sound” condition was the same
as Experiment 1. The “Sound-to-Color” presented the same
distribution of exemplars, but during the Training phase
people predicted alien color (red or blue) from sound (loud
or quiet).
Methods Thirty college students at UW-Madison
participated for course credit. Fifteen participated in the
“Color-to-Sound” (CtS) condition, which was identical to
the Partial condition from Experiment 1. Fifteen participated
in the “Sound-to-Color” (StC), which varied only in the
Training phase. StC participants were told the sound an
alien made (loud or quiet) and asked to predict its color.
Upon making a guess, the picture of the alien appeared and
participants received corrective feedback. Critically,
participants encountered the same exemplars in both
conditions. The only difference was which probabilities
were forward and which were inverse. In the CtS condition,
p(sound|color) was forward and p(color|sound) was inverse.
Forward conditional probabilities are those the participants
made during the training phase (e.g., predicting sound from
color). Inverse probabilities are those the participants were
not trained to make (e.g., they did not predict color from
sound in the training phase). In the StC condition,

Conclusions

me something is a dog?” but also “what does knowing
something is a dog tell me?” However, we know little about
the conditions under which children and adults learn these
relations together or separately.

The results of the two experiments are generally
consistent with findings from the categorization and
perceptual learning literature: Participants learn the
distinctions they are trained on (forward). Taught to predict
sound from color participants formed accurate
representations of p(loud|red) and p(loud|blue). During the
course of learning, participants were exposed to exemplars
that also provided information about the inverse conditional
probabilities, p(red|loud) and p(red|quiet). However, people
did not seem to use this information, or did not use it as
effectively as the information about the trained
discriminations. When called upon to use the conditional
probabilities not directly trained, people seemed to “work
backwards” from the ones they were trained on. In effect,
both adults and young children showed the inverse fallacy
(Villejoubert & Mandel, 2002), they used p(A|B) to estimate
p(B|A). They relied on this fallacy rather than actually
learning p(B|A) as they were learning p(A|B).
The current study has some important limitations. First
the sample sizes were small, and there were a large number
of non-learners among children. Second, the measures of
participants’ probability judgments were very imprecise.
This is likely an unavoidable limit with children, but
probability estimates could be measured more directly with
adults. In any case it would be useful to ask for frequency
estimates. Previous research has shown that young children
may have accurate memories for relative frequencies of
exemplars, even as their predictions/probability estimates
seem at odds with these frequencies (Kalish, 2010). Finally,
the differences between forward and inverse conditional
probabilities were rather subtle. The relations between
learning forward and inverses might be different when
probabilities reverse (e.g., p(A|B)>.5, p(B|A)<.5). The
working assumption has been that young children are
sensitive to only very large qualitative differences in
probabilities (e.g., all, none, unpredictable), but this remains
to be explored.
One of the big remaining questions is whether forward
and inverse probabilities are ever learned together. Are there
some learning tasks that promote both? One way to
characterize the pattern observed is that people get very
good at solving the problem posed to them, but at a cost of
not forming more general representations that could be
useful for solving other problems. Perhaps less “goaldirected” training would support generative as well as
discriminative learning. The previous studies, in which
children simply encountered exemplars (e.g., saw red and
loud at the same time), suggest that forward and inverse
conditional probabilities do affect each other. Of course, the
flip side to this question is the fact that experience is not
always informative about all probabilities. For example,
depending on how the training exemplars have been
selected it may be only possible to generalize forward
probabilities to a larger population and not inverses. In
general, it seems most useful to learn both forward and
inverse probabilities. We want to learn not only “what tells
