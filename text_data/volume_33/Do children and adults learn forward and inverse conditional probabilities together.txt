loud at the same time), suggest that forward and inverse
conditional probabilities do affect each other. Of course, the
flip side to this question is the fact that experience is not
always informative about all probabilities. For example,
depending on how the training exemplars have been
selected it may be only possible to generalize forward
probabilities to a larger population and not inverses. In
general, it seems most useful to learn both forward and
inverse probabilities. We want to learn not only “what tells
