   On the available evidence then, A-not-B errors cannot be

Aguiar & Baillargeon, 2000). Nor do these errors result
from difficulties in conceptualizing objects: infants can
search successfully at the first location. Given that it seems
that infants understand the task, and can switch, what needs
to be explained is why they initially fail to search correctly

  Although the display shown to the infants was intended to
mimic manual A-not-B search, it was not infant-controlled,
as is often the case in manual studies. In a manual search
task, the toys can continue to be hidden at location A until
the infant has reached a success criterion for searching at
that location, ensuring that the infant has been attending to,
and learning about, the hiding events; however, in the
