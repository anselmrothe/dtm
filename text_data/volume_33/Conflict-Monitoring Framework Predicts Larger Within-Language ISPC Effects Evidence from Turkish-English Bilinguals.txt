Abstract
In this study, we investigated within- and between-language
Item-Specific Proportion Congruence (ISPC) effects in
Turkish-English bilinguals in two experiments. In both
experiments we manipulated the language of the ISPC lists,
while keeping the response language the same (Turkish in
Experiment 1, and English in Experiment 2). We observed a
larger within-language ISPC effect compared to betweenlanguage ISPC effect in both experiments. These results are
consistent with the predictions of conflict-monitoring models
of the ISPC effect.
Keywords: Stroop interference; conflict monitoring; ISPC;
Turkish-English bilinguals.

Introduction
Stroop paradigm (Stroop, 1935; see MacLeod, 1991 for a
review) has been widely used to investigate control of
attention. In this paradigm, color-words (e.g., red, green,
blue) are printed in different colors (red, green, or blue), and
participants name the colors, while ignoring the colorwords. Responses are slower when the word is incongruent
with its color (e.g., when the word red is printed in green),
compared to when it is congruent (e.g., when the word red is
printed in red). The reaction time difference between the
incongruent and congruent conditions is referred to as the
Stroop interference. Stroop interference demonstrates
effects of word-reading processes on color-naming
performance (Cohen, Dunbar, & McClelland, 1990;
MacLeod, 1991). Variations in the magnitude of Stroop
interference as a result of some experimental manipulations
demonstrate control over attentional processes (Blais,
Robidoux, Risko, & Besner, 2007; Botvinick, Braver,
Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001; Verguts & Notebaert, 2008).
One such manipulation is the list level proportion
congruence manipulation, in which Stroop interference is
affected by the proportion of congruent and incongruent
stimuli in the task. When the proportion of incongruent
stimuli is higher, Stroop interference is smaller as compared
to when it is lower (Logan, Zbrodoff, & Williamson, 1984;
Tzelgov, Henik, & Berger, 1992). In this case, participants
use a global strategy to control effects of word reading on
color naming. Kane and Engle (2003) argued that
participants were able to successfully maintain the task-goal
(color naming) across trials when the proportion of
incongruent stimuli was higher, but they had difficulties
when it was lower. These results show that participants
strategically controlled the effects of word-reading

processes on color-naming performance in a goal-directed
manner.
List-level control in the Stroop task was simulated with
the classic conflict-monitoring framework (Botvinick, et al.,
2001). According to this framework, control processes are
triggered by a module responsible for detecting conflicts in
information processing, namely the conflict monitoring unit.
This unit represents the function of anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) in the human brain (Botvinick, Cohen, & Carter,
2004). It calculates the amount of conflict at the response
layer, and increases the activation of the task-demand (color
naming) unit when conflict is high. In the Stroop task,
incongruent items generate more conflict than congruent
items (see also Goldfarb & Henik, 2007; MacLeod &
MacDonald, 2000). Higher proportions of incongruent
stimuli in the list give rise to higher levels of calculated
conflict, which in turn results in increased cognitive control
via the activation of the task demand (color naming) unit.
Another manipulation is the item-specific proportion
congruence manipulation. Jacoby, Lindsay and Hessels
(2003) showed that control over word-reading processes
operated at the item-level as well. In their study, proportion
congruence of each item was manipulated, keeping the list
wide proportion of congruent and incongruent items equal.
They divided color words into two sets (e.g., green and
black vs. blue and yellow). The first set (green and black)
was presented mostly in their congruent color, while the
second set (blue and yellow) was presented mostly in their
incongruent color. They observed larger/smaller Stroop
interference for the mostly congruent/incongruent items.
Jacoby et al. (2003) termed this effect as item-specific
proportion congruence (ISPC) effect. The random
distribution of equal number of congruent and incongruent
items prevented participants from predicting the incoming
stimuli. Therefore, control over word-reading processes was
set after the onset of the stimuli, depending on the
proportion congruence of the specific item.
The conflict-monitoring framework was also used to
simulate the item-level control in the Stroop task (Blais et
al., 2007; Verguts & Notebaert, 2008, 2009). Blais et al.
(2007) modified Botvinick et al. (2001)'s model so that the
conflict monitoring system modulated the effects of task
demand only for the relevant color, as opposed to the
original model which modulated the whole pathway. In
other words, it was able to register item-specific conflicts
and regulate their effects on information processing
accordingly. The modified model successfully simulated

1724

both item- and list-level proportion congruence effects
(Blais et al., 2007). Verguts and Notebaert (2008) proposed
a Hebbian learning account of item-specific control.
According to this account, the conflict monitoring system
triggers an arousal response, which modulates Hebbian
learning processes so that Hebbian learning increases when
conflict is higher. Verguts and Notebaert (2009) were able
to simulate the ISPC effect with this model.
Tzelgov and Kadosh (2009) proposed an extension to
ISPC models to explain the relationship between cognitive
control and language proficiency. Tzelgov, Henik and
Leiser (1990) had previously shown that control of Stroop
interference was better in the dominant language in
bilinguals. They presented bilinguals mixed lists containing
color words both in their dominant and nondominant
languages. One list contained more words in the dominant
language, the other in the nondominant language. Tzelgov et
al. (1990) observed smaller Stroop interference when a
higher proportion of trials were presented in the dominant
language. Control over word-reading processes was better
for the color-words in participants’ dominant language. The
extension proposed by Tzelgov and Kadosh (2009) in order
to simulate this dominant language advantage involves
adding a layer for nondominant language words. In the
extended model, what gives rise to differential levels of
conflict is the language difference, that is, Stroop words in
the dominant language generate more conflict than words in
the nondominant language. Higher conflict in the dominant
language results in increased cognitive control via the
processes described in the conflict monitoring models
discussed above (Blais et al., 2007; Verguts and Notebaert,
2008, 2009).
Extending ISPC models by including separate layers for
dominant and nondominant languages gives rise to another
prediction regarding the within- vs. between-language ISPC
effect. One robust finding from Stroop studies is that
between-language Stroop effect is smaller than the withinlanguage Stroop effect (see MacLeod, 1991 for a review).
Therefore, it would be safe to assume, on the basis of
conflict monitoring models, that the within-language
condition would generate more conflict compared to the
between-language condition. In keeping with the notion that
control is a function of conflict monitoring, we would
expect the within-language ISPC effect to be higher than the
between-language ISPC effect. In the present study, we
tested this prediction with Turkish-English bilinguals.

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we manipulated the language of the ISPC
lists, keeping the response language the same (Turkish). If
the ISPC effect is based on conflict monitoring processes
(Blais et al., 2007; Verguts & Notebaert, 2008, 2009), then
it would be higher for the Turkish list (the within-language
condition) than the English list (the between-language
condition).

Method
Participants The participants were 48 students from a
psychology course at Middle East Technical University,
who voluntarily participated for extra course credit. All of
them were Turkish-English bilinguals of Turkish origin.
Turkish was the native language of all participants. They
studied English for an average of 9.89 years. They were
quite proficient in English, but knew Turkish better. They
spoke only Turkish at home and in their daily life, but spoke
only English in classes. All participants had normal or
corrected-to normal visual acuity and normal color vision.
Materials Stimuli and procedure of the experiments was
approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of
Middle East Technical University. Stimuli consisted of lists
of color words that were either in Turkish or in English. The
Turkish and English lists were identical, except for the
language of the words. Stimuli consisted of color-words,
yeşil (green), siyah (black), mavi (blue), sarı (yellow), a
strings of three ‘%%%’ and four ‘%%%%’ percentage
signs. For congruent stimuli, the color words were printed in
their matching ink color, e.g. black was printed in black
font. For incongruent stimuli the color words were printed
in their nonmatching ink-color, e.g. black was printed in
green font. For neutral stimuli percentage signs were printed
in all ink colors. Each color word was presented 48 times.
Colors were divided into two groups (green and black vs.
blue and yellow) to produce MC (mostly congruent) and MI
(mostly incongruent) conditions. For MC condition 36 of 48
(75%) presentations were congruent. For MI condition 36 of
48 (75%) presentations were incongruent. There were 96
congruent, 96 incongruent, and 16 neutral stimuli. Color
words were presented in a fixed random order with the
constraint that no more than 3 congruent or 3 incongruent
items appeared successively. The stimuli were printed with
a 60-point Arial font in green, black, blue, or yellow color,
at the center of the monitor screen against a gray (R:166,
G:166, B:166) background. A centered fixation signal (+)
appeared for 1000 ms and an empty screen that lasts 500 ms
preceded each stimulus.
Procedure There were two sessions in the experiment. In
the first session color words were in Turkish, and
participants responded in Turkish. In the second session
color words were in English, and participants again
responded in Turkish. Each session took about 30 min.
There were 18.62 days on average between the two sessions.
The assignment of color words to the MI and MC conditions
and the order of sessions were counterbalanced across
participants. Participants signed the informed consent form
and filled a questionnaire on color blindness and proficiency
in Turkish and English. Automatic stimulus display, and
data collection were controlled with a PC running E-Prime
2.0 software. Participants were instructed to name the ink
color of the stimulus out loud as quickly, and as accurately
as possible. The stimulus appeared on the screen until the
voice key was tripped, or until the 3000 ms response

1725

deadline was reached. The experimenter coded the given
responses via the keyboard. A trial was coded as scratch if
the voice key was tripped by noise. Twenty-eight practice
trials preceded the main experiment. The structure of the
practice trials was the same as the main experiment.

Results and Discussion
Correct RTs less than 200 ms and greater than 2,000 ms
were removed (fewer than 1% of all trials). RTs for correct
responses and error rates (ERs) for each condition of the
experiment were calculated for each participant.
The same ANOVAs were conducted on both RTs and
ERs. ERs were rather low (mean Turkish=0.018, mean
English=0.016) and they yielded findings similar to that of
the RTs. Therefore, they are not reported in detail here.
For RTs, 2 X 2 X 2 within-subjects ANOVA was
conducted, with stimulus language (Turkish vs. English),
proportion congruence (mostly congruent vs. mostly
incongruent), and trial type (congruent vs. incongruent) as
within-subjects factors. Figure 1 presents means and
standard errors for each condition in Experiment 1. There
was a significant main effect of trial type [F(1, 47) =
236.36, MSE = 1581.23, p < .001,
= .83] (mean
congruent=665 ms, mean incongruent= 728 ms), and
stimulus language [F(1, 47) = 8.84, MSE = 6538.94, p <
.005,
= .15] (mean Turkish= 709 ms, mean English=684
ms). Moreover, the stimulus language and trial type [F(1,
47) = 54.14, MSE = 843.97, p < .001,
= .53] interaction
was also significant. The Stroop effect was higher for
Turkish words (84 ms) than English words (40 ms). The
proportion congruence and trial type [F(1, 47) = 51.94, MSE
= 959.54, p < .001,
= .52] interaction was also
significant. Stroop effect was higher in the MC condition
(85 ms), compared to the MI condition (39 ms). Therefore,
ISPC effect (45 ms) was significant. Importantly, the critical
three-way interaction between stimulus language,
proportion congruency and trial type [F(1, 47) = 4.47, MSE
= 535.10, p < .05,
= .08] was significant, in that, ISPC
effect was higher with Turkish words (55 ms), compared to
English words (35 ms). In order to investigate whether the
ISPC effect was significant for both languages, Turkish and
English RTs were analyzed with separate 2 X 2 withinsubjects ANOVAs with trial type and proportion
congruence as within-subjects factors. For Turkish words,
there was a significant main effect of trial type [F(1, 47) =
186.50, MSE = 1825.20, p < .001,
= .79] (mean
congruent=669 ms , mean incongruent= 751 ms). The twoway interaction between proportion congruence and trial
type was also significant [F(1, 47) = 39.91, MSE = 928.12, p
< .001,
= .45]. Stroop effect was higher in the MC
condition (112 ms), compared to the MI condition (56 ms),
which showed that ISPC effect (55 ms) was significant for
Turkish words. For English words, there was a significant
main effect of trial type [F(1, 47) = 131.72, MSE = 600.01,
p < .001,
= .73] (mean congruent=664 ms, mean
incongruent= 704 ms). The two-way interaction between

proportion congruence and trial type was significant [F(1,
47) = 26.82, MSE = 566.52, p < .001,
= .36]. Stroop
effect was higher in the MC condition (58 ms), compared to
the MI condition (22 ms), which showed that ISPC effect
(35 ms) was significant for English words.
In Experiment 1, we replicated the robust finding that
within-language Stroop interference was larger than
between-language Stroop interference. More importantly,
within-language ISPC effect was measured to be larger than
the between-language ISPC effect. This specific finding was
predicted by the extended version of the conflict monitoring
model, in which separate layers were added to represent
words in the dominant and nondominant languages (Blais et
al., 2007; Verguts & Notebaert, 2008, 2009; Tzelgov &
Kadosh, 2009). Thus, our results confirmed this prediction.
Tzelgov et al. (1990) showed that control was better for
words presented in the dominant language in bilinguals. In
our experiment, the within-language condition also
happened to be the dominant language condition, since the
dominant language of our participants was Turkish, and they
also responded in Turkish. Therefore, there is always the
possibility that control was higher in the within-language
condition just because words were presented in the
dominant language, not because of the difference in conflict
levels between the between- and within-language
conditions. Therefore, our results can also be explained by
the relationship between control and language proficiency
(Tzelgov et al., 1990). To test this possibility we designed
Experiment 2.

Experiment 2
In this experiment, participants responded in English to the
same set of materials in Experiment 1. If the reason why we
observed better control in the within-language condition is
simply because there is better control for words in one’s
dominant language, then we should see better control in the
between-language condition, in which words were presented
in the dominant language (Turkish). On the other hand, if

1726

the difference between the within- and between-language
ISPC effect is indeed a result of different levels of conflict
in the between- and within-language conditions, then we
should see larger ISPC effects in the within-language
condition.

Method
Participants The participants were 36 students from a
psychology course at Middle East Technical University,
who voluntarily participated for extra course credit. All
participants had normal or corrected-to normal visual acuity
and normal color vision. They studied English for an
average of 9.45 years. None of them participated in
Experiment 1.
Materials and Procedure The materials and procedure was
exactly the same as in Experiment 1 except that responses
were given in English. There were 16 days on average
between the two sessions of the experiment.

ISPC effect (31 ms) was significant for Turkish words. For
English words, there was a significant main effect of trial
type [F(1, 35) = 180.45, MSE = 2085.04, p < .001,
= .83]
(mean congruent = 685 ms, mean incongruent = 787 ms). In
addition, there was a significant two-way interaction
between proportion congruence and trial type [F(1, 35) =
54.80, MSE = 1004.12, p < .001,
= .61]. Stroop effect
was higher in the MC condition (141 ms), compared to the
MI condition (63 ms). In other words, ISPC effect (78 ms)
was significant for English words.
In Experiment 2, we replicated the results of Experiment
1. We again observed the robust finding that withinlanguage Stroop interference was larger than betweenlanguage Stroop interference, and that within-language
ISPC effect was larger compared to the between-language
ISPC effect. This latter result showed that ISPC effect in
bilinguals was a function of the level of conflict generated
by within- and between-language conditions.

Results and Discussion
Correct RTs less than 200 ms and greater than 2,000 ms
were removed (fewer than 1% of all trials). Figure 2
presents means and standard errors for the conditions of
Experiment 2. Analyses were the same as in Experiment 1.
ERs were rather low (mean Turkish=0.01, mean
English=0.013) and they yielded findings similar to that of
the RTs. Therefore, they are not reported in detail here.
For RTs, There was a significant main effect of trial type
[F(1, 35) = 188.25, MSE = 2059.29, p < .001,
= .84]
(mean congruent = 698 ms, mean incongruent = 771 ms).
The two-way stimulus language and trial type [F(1, 35) =
49.33, MSE = 1215.13, p < .001,
= .58] interaction was
significant. The Stroop effect was higher for English words
(102 ms) than Turkish words (44 ms). The proportion
congruence and trial type [F(1, 35) = 38.60, MSE =
1394.49, p < .001,
= .52] interaction was also significant.
Stroop effect was higher in the MC condition (100 ms),
compared to the MI condition (46 ms). Therefore, ISPC
effect (45 ms) was significant. Importantly, the critical
three-way interaction between stimulus language,
proportion congruency and trial type [F(1, 35) = 15.71, MSE
= 632.90, p < .001,
= .31] was significant, in that, ISPC
effect was higher with English words (78 ms), compared to
Turkish words (31 ms). In order to investigate the nature of
the significant three-way interaction, Turkish and English
RTs were analyzed with separate 2 X 2 within-subjects
ANOVAs with trial type and proportion congruence as
within-subjects factors. For Turkish words, there was a
significant main effect of trial type [F(1, 35) = 59.99, MSE
= 1189.38, p < .001,
= .63] (mean congruent = 711 ms ,
mean incongruent= 755 ms). The two-way interaction
between proportion congruence and trial type was also
significant [F(1, 35) = 8.55, MSE = 1023.27, p < .01,
=
.19]. Stroop effect was higher in the MC condition (60 ms),
compared to the MI condition (28 ms), which showed that

General Discussion
A novel finding in this study was that within-language
ISPC effect was larger than the between-language ISPC
effect. This finding is successfully predicted by a conflict
monitoring model which employed separate layers for
dominant and nondominant languages (Blais et al., 2007;
Verguts & Notebaert, 2008, 2009; Tzelgov & Kadosh,
2009).
An alternative explanation of the ISPC effect, namely the
contingency learning hypothesis (Schmidt & Besner, 2008),
is undermined with this finding. According to this account
ISPC effect reflects (possibly unconscious) learning of
stimulus-response contingencies, but not the dynamic
adaptation of control processes. Schmidt and Besner (2008)
claim that participants learn the correlation between words
and responses in an ISPC manipulation, which allows them
to predict a specific response for each word. The prediction
lowers the threshold for specific responses associated with
specific words. Therefore, for the mostly congruent

1727

condition, responses are faster for the congruent stimuli, but
not for the incongruent stimuli, which increases Stroop
interference. Similarly, for the mostly incongruent
condition, responses are faster for the incongruent stimuli,
but not for the congruent stimuli, which decreases Stroop
interference (Schmidt & Besner, 2008). Assuming that
stimulus-response learning between the color-words and
responses should not depend on language, the contingency
learning account does not predict a difference between
within-language and between-language ISPC lists. This is
contrary to our results.
Nevertheless, our results are not in conflict with Tzelgov
et al. (1990), who showed control was better for words in
the dominant language irrespective of the response
language. Tzelgov et al. (1990) used dominant and
nondominant language words within the same list, and they
manipulated the expectancy for each language. Our ISPC
lists, on the other hand, contained words only from one
language, that is, we did not investigate the three-way
relationship between ISPC effect, language, and expectancy.
If expectancy for dominant and nondominant language
words were to be manipulated within the same ISPC list, it
would be possible to see whether control of Stroop
interference as a function of language proficiency was
independent from item-specific control as a function of
within- vs. between language conflict levels. We are
currently investigating this possibility.
