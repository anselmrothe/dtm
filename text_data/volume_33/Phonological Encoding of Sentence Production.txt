Discussion
The results in the subject region of Experiment 2 are similar
to the findings in the verb region in Experiment 1;
conditions with both identical and similar rhymes increase
the likelihood of producing a disfluency. Also in line with
Experiment 1, the probability of producing a disfluency
between identical rhymes increased with verb frequency.
We can only speculate that the reason that these effects
