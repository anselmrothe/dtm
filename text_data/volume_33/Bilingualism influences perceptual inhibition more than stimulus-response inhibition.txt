Abstract: Bilinguals outperform monolinguals at suppressing task-irrelevant information, with advantages likely
deriving from cognitive mechanisms employed during bilingual processing. In this study, monolinguals’ and bilinguals’
inhibition performance was compared on two nonlinguistic inhibition tasks: a Stroop-like task (with perceptual
conflict among stimulus features) and a Simon-like task (with stimulus-response conflict, given an arbitrary response
rule). Bilinguals in their early twenties had an accuracy advantage over monolinguals on the Stroop task but not the
Simon task. Bilinguals showed smaller Stroop than Simon effects in their performance accuracy, while monolinguals
performed similarly on the two tasks. Findings suggest that bilingual experience may target Stroop-type inhibition
more than Simon-type inhibition, likely due to the perceptual conflict component of Stroop tasks that is also present
in bilingual processing. Findings have implications for identifying loci of influence of bilingual experience on the
cognitive system, and suggest that Stroop-type cognitive mechanisms may be especially sensitive to bilingualism.
