Abstract: University students (n = 86) revised their beliefs about story-based relationships in the face of new,
contradictory information. Prior to resolving an inconsistency, students drew a picture depicting the story informa-
tion. Participantsâ€™ resolution of logical inconsistencies reflected (a) the structure of the facts at hand and (b) the
relationship conveyed by the major premise (All p are q). Students were more committed to a story relationship
when the contradiction challenged the outcome of a modus tollens ( q, p) rather than modus ponens (p,q) inference.
Commitment to story relations was also greater when p represented a cohesive group whose characteristic q was
critical to their definition as a group. When p represented a more ambiguous group, students drew more people and
were less likely to retain the story relations. The preference to preserve a generalization is dependent on the nature
of the logical contradiction and its implications to group entitativity.
