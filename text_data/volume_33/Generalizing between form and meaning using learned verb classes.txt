given AnimEX animacy.
   There is thus a strong interaction between the alternation
cues and the animacy cues. When animacy reflects a change
of state verb (the black bars in Figure 2), the alternation has
no effect on the preference. When animacy reflects an expres-
sion verb (the white bars in Figure 2), the alternation pattern
has a strong effect. Verb usage patterns in the corpus provide
a strong bias for a change of state interpretation of a novel
verb, and the model requires two strong cues (frequent in-
transitives as well as frequent animate subjects) in order to
pull its interpretation in favour of an expression verb. These      Figure 3: Using the meaning of a novel verb, shown only as
