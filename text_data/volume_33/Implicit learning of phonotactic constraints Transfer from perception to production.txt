experimentally restricted consonants (coefficient = 3.404,
standard error = 0.725, p < .001). More unrestricted
consonant errors are legal than would be expected by chance
(illegality is below 50%) because even unrestricted
consonants tend to stick to their syllable positions in a
sequence (MacKay, 1970).
   Errors from participants in the Opposite-constraint
condition showed a different profile (Figure 1). Most
importantly, there was evidence of transfer between
perception and production: restricted consonants were
illegal 13.5% of the time on average in the Opposite-
constraint condition, more than ten times the illegality rate
in the Same-constraint condition. By contrast, the illegality
rate of unrestricted consonants in the Opposite-constraint
condition (36.3% on average) was comparable to that in the
Same-constraint condition, an expected result given that                Figure 1: percentages of restricted consonant errors that
unrestricted consonants did not differ in their distribution       are illegal across conditions, with standard error of the mean
across conditions (Figure 2). The interaction between
constraint and restrictedness was significant (coefficient =
1.049, standard error = 0.384, p = .006).
   We can be sure that participants learned the constraints
present in heard sequences, because these interfered with
(Opposite-constraint condition) and/or enhanced (Same-
constraint condition) the constraints learned in production,
as revealed by their speech errors. This interpretation is
bolstered by good error monitoring accuracy of participants
in the Opposite- (71.5%) and Same- (73.5%) constraint
conditions. This suggests that participants did indeed engage
in the task designed to make them predict during perception
trials: they remembered the first presentation and used it to
monitor the second presentation of the sequence.
   The transfer between perception and production, however,
was only partial, like that found by Warker et al. (2009).            Figure 2: percentages of unrestricted consonant errors that
