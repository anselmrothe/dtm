the colored blocks replaced the words. These blocks
indicated how the words should be spatially described (see
Figure 1). Participants were asked to produce the ingredients
of the compound noun phrases in a natural order, top-to-
bottom or left-to-right.
   Participants were asked to produce the sentences as
quickly and accurately as possible. They were shown four
examples before proceeding to a practice section of 12
productions. During the practice trials the experimenter
corrected any errors and clarified the procedure as
necessary.
   The sentences were organized in prime-target pairs but
presented in a continuous stream. The sequence of sentence
pairs was fully randomized. The experiment was broken into
two sections, with the opportunity for a break between
sections. The session was recorded for later coding.
