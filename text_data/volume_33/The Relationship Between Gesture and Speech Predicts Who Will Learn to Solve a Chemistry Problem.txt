Abstract: When children explain their answers to tasks that they have yet to master, some produce gestures that
include additional information not found in their speech. These children are likely to benefit from instruction in the
task. Here we investigate the possibility that different types of gesture-speech relationships might index readiness to
learn for adult novice learners. Adults, naı̈ve to organic chemistry, were asked to create stereoisomers of molecules,
a task that requires mentally transforming and drawing an alternative spatial arrangement of parts of the molecule.
Adults whose gestures added correct information to the information conveyed in speech at pretest were more likely to
learn on the task than adults whose gestures did not add information or added incorrect information. These findings
suggest that, even for adult learners and complex tasks, gesture reveals implicit knowledge about the task at hand
and can be used to identify who is ready to learn.
