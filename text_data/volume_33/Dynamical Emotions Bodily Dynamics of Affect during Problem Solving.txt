of analyzing dynamical systems with RQA.
    Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA)
A dynamical system at time consists of a state, which is an
  -dimensional point in a -dimensional space, called a state
space or phase space. There is a fixed rule, which
determines how the system transitions from one state to
another and a trajectory represents a sequence of such state
transitions. For example, the popular Lorenz attractor is a
dynamical system governed by the following three
equations:                   ;                     ;
     (    and are parameters) (Lorenz, 1963). Time series
of length 1,000 created from the three Lorenz equations are
presented in Figure 1A and the resultant phase space plot is
presented in Figure 1B. It should be noted that the system is
called an attractor (Lorenz attractor) because the trajectory

and repelled from others (the white space).                             Figure 1. Recurrence quantification analysis of the Lorenz
