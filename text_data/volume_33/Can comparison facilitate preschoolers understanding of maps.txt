Abstract: We investigated how principles of analogy and comparison can be used to enhance children’s understand-
ing of maps. We taught 30 four-year-old children a map of a pretend neighborhood, and then tested their knowledge
of both the learned neighborhood and a new one. The children were assigned randomly to either the comparison
group, which learned the map through comparison, or to the control group, which learned the map without direct
comparison to the neighborhood. We measured participants’ understanding of the map using three tasks that mea-
sured children’s ability to reason about correspondences between spatial relations on the map and in the pretend
neighborhood. The same three tasks were also carried out afterward on a different neighborhood in order to test if
the ability of understanding maps could be transferred to a new neighborhood. Results indicated strong effects of
comparison on learning and modest but significant effects on transfer.
