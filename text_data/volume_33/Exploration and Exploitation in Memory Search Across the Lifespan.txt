Abstract

Semantic retrieval can be understood as the search for
desired information in cognitive memory space. As such,
search in memory also requires handling an explorationexploitation tradeoff as it involves a choice between
exploiting a currently accessible area of a cognitive
representation (i.e., local search) and exploring new areas
(i.e., global search). Such a local-to-global search policy has
been previously proposed for memory retrieval
(Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981; Troyer et al., 1997).
Hills, Todd, and Goldstone (2010) have proposed that a
domain-general executive search process may underlie this
local-to-global search behavior in both external and internal
search tasks. There are several arguments supporting this
view. First, there is evidence of cross-domain priming, such
that experience with external search, such as a visual-spatial
search task, primes internal search behavior in a lexical task
(Hills, Todd, & Goldstone, 2008). Second, there are
similarities in the strategies employed in external and
internal search, with participants showing similar giving-up
time strategies when searching for fish in virtual ponds
(Hutchinson, Wilke, and Todd, 2008) and words from
memory (Wilke, Hutchinson, Todd, & Czienskowski,
2009). Finally, there is evidence for domain-general
neuromodulatory mechanisms involved in balancing the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff (Cohen, McClure, Yu,
2007; Hills, 2006).
Given the proposed link between search processes and
executive function more generally (Hills et al. 2010) and the
posited role of catecholamines in modulating explorative
behavior (Cohen, McClure, Yu, 2007; Hills, 2006), it is
expected that age-related deficits in executive function
caused by catecholaminergic deficits (Bäckman et al., 2000;
Volkow, et al. 1998) could lead to significant differences in
search behavior across the life span. Indeed, there is some
evidence of age differences in dealing with explorationexploitation tradeoffs, with aging leading to reduced
exploration in external search (Louâpre, van Alphen, &
Pierre, 2010; Mata, Wilke, & Czienskowski, 2009; Mata &
Nunes. 2010). Also, there is a substantial amount of work
showing significant age differences in memory retrieval
(Spencer & Raz, 1995). More importantly, older adults tend
to produce fewer words in semantic fluency tasks (e.g.,
Kozora & Cullum, 1995; Lanting, Haugrud, & Crossley,
2009; Tomer & Levin, 1993; Troyer, 2000), which could
also be interpreted as reduced exploration in internal search,

We used a formal model of memory (Raaijmakers & Shiffrin,
1981) to model semantic search processes of adults aged
between 29 to 99 years of age in the animal naming task
(“name all the animals you can”; Thurstone, 1938). Overall,
our results support the idea that people switch between global
frequency-based retrieval cues and local item-based retrieval
cues to navigate their semantic memory. We extend this work
by showing the involvement of an executive attention process,
as switching is inversely correlated with digit span.
Furthermore, our results reveal a further independent effect of
aging, associated with increased switching between global
and local memory cues for older individuals. These results are
consistent with models of working memory and executive
processing as representing a measure of goal perseveration
and the ability to inhibit distracting information (Kane &
Engle, 2004; Hills et al., 2010).
Keywords: search; semantic memory; modeling; aging.

Many real-world situations involve tradeoffs between
known, currently available resources and other, more
uncertain ones. In this paper, we argue that aging is
associated with differences in dealing with this tradeoff in
search from memory as a result of age-related cognitive
decline. We draw our conclusions from results of formal
modeling of memory search processes in a widely used and
clinically relevant task: the animal naming task (“name all
the animals you can”; Thurstone, 1938; Lezak, 1995). Our
modeling approach is based on the dynamic component of
Search of Associative Memory (Raaijmakers & Shiffrin,
1981) searching over a semantic representation of animals
created using the semantic space model BEAGLE (Jones &
Mewhort, 2004). This framework allows us to test
competing formalizations of search in semantic space and,
ultimately, link individual differences in semantic search to
age and fluid intellectual abilities. Before describing the
study, we first outline the motivation for studying the
exploration-exploitation trade-off across the lifespan, and
prior work on age differences in memory search.

The Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma
When searching for objects in space, such as when
foraging for food, one has to trade off exploring new or less
known regions and exploiting known ones, thus hoping to
find the balance necessary to maximize the rate of return, a
problem often called the exploration-exploitation dilemma.

or an earlier giving-up time. In the remainder of this paper
we focus on age differences in semantic retrieval, and ask
whether age differences in this domain can be attributed to
the impact of aging on exploration-exploitation behavior.

formalization,
which
goes
hand-in-hand
with
underspecification of the source of age differences in
semantic retrieval. For example, the speed account of
retrieval deficits has not proposed what specific cues are
used to access memory (Mayr, 2002). In turn, Troyer et al.
(1997) proposed a detailed list of categories that are likely
used to access semantic memory but have failed to specify
how search is carried out within a category. Our work aims
to fill this gap by testing how different mechanisms of
search in the form of competing formal accounts best
captures participants’ semantic retrieval. In particular, we
utilize a new method for identifying local-to-global
transitions, called the similarity drop model, which is based
on a patch depletion model of memory (Hills, Todd, &
Jones, 2008). In addition, we link individual differences in
model parameters to age differences to assess the impact of
aging on specific components of memory search.

Age Differences in Memory Search
The aging literature suggests that increased age is
associated with memory retrieval deficits, namely, aging is
associated with the production of fewer items in semantic
retrieval tasks, such the animal naming task (“name all the
animals you can”; e.g., Kozora & Cullum, 1995; Lanting,
Haugrud, & Crossley, 2009; Tomer & Levin, 1993; Troyer,
2000). The nature of the deficit or whether this is related to
mastering the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, however,
remains controversial.
One view holds that semantic retrieval deficits are simply
due to general age-related slowing (Mayr, 2002; Mayr &
Kliegl, 2000). According to this view, the nature of the
processes underlying search are relatively constant across
the life span but are executed at slower speeds with
increased age. For example, Mayr and Kliegel (2000) found
that younger and older adults showed similar switch-costs in
terms of the time needed to produce items from two
different categories.
An alternative perspective, the clustering-switching
hypothesis, is that there are specific search processes that
are impacted by aging (Troyer, Moscovitch, & Winocur,
1997). Troyer et al. have suggested that retrieving items
from memory involves, first, a search for semantic
categories, and second, a search for and production of words
within a category. Accordingly, the search process can be
described as exploration (i.e, switching between categories)
and exploitation (i.e., clustering or producing items from
within a category; see Gruenewald & Lockhead, 1980;
Wixted & Rohrer, 1994; for similar views). Troyer et al.
went on to analyze younger and older participant’s fluency
productions and obtain a measure of switching (i.e., the
number of switches between categories) and clustering (i.e.,
the mean number of items in a cluster). A few studies have
now used this cluster-switching approach to investigate
adult age-differences in semantic fluency and found that
aging is associated with fewer switches between categories
(Lanting, Haugrud, & Crossley, 2009; Troyer et al., 1997;
Troyer, 2000; but see Rosseli, Tappen, Williams,
Salvatierra, & Zoller, 2009). The results regarding the size
of each cluster are less clear with two studies finding no
differences (Troyer et al., 1997; Troyer, 2000), and others
finding increased number of items per cluster with increased
age (Lanting, Haugrud, & Crossley, 2009), at least for some
semantic categories (Rosseli. Tappen, Williams, Salvatierra,
& Zoller, 2009). Troyer and colleages (Troyer et al., 2007;
Troyer, 2000) have used this evidence to suggest that aging
may be associated with difficulties in switching between
categories, an ability linked to attentional and executive
networks that are considerably affected by aging (Bäckman
et al., 2000; Volkow, et al. 1998).
One difficulty facing these two approaches is their lack of

Methods
Participants and Procedure
Two-hundred and one participants, with ages ranging from
27 to 99 (Median = 68, M = 65.45, SD = 13.53), participated
in the study. Participants were recruited through postings at
a health center in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of a
study on health preferences (Carstensen, 2010). Participants
completed a number of questionnaires regarding their health
preferences followed by a small battery of cognitive tests,
including the animal naming (Thurstone, 1938) and digit
span (Weschler, 1981) tasks which were included as
measures of fluid intellectual ability. Participants were
compensated for their participation in the study ($50).

Representing the Structure of Semantic Memory
Beagle Semantic Space Model. We used the lexical
semantic representations of animals computed in prior work
(Hills, Todd, & Jones, 2008), using the BEAGLE model
(Jones & Mewhort, 2007). BEAGLE learns semantic
relations by assigning each word an initial vector with
vector elements sampled randomly from a Gaussian
distribution with µ = 0 and σ = 1 / D where D is the vector
dimensionality (set to 1000 in these simulations). As the text
corpus is processed, a word’s memory vector is updated
each time the word is encountered as the sum of the initial
vectors for the other words appearing in context with it.
When the entire corpus has been learned, a word’s memory
representation is then a vector pattern reflecting the word’s
history of co-occurrence with other words. By this method,
words that frequently co-occur will develop similar vector
patterns (e.g., bee-honey), as will words that commonly
occur in similar contexts, even if they never directly cooccur (e.g., bee-wasp). For all of our comparisons, the
pairwise similarity metric used is the vector cosine (a
normalized dot-product between two word vectors).
BEAGLE was trained on a subset of Wikipedia, composed
of approximately 400 million word tokens and 3 million
word types. Support for BEAGLE comes from its
considerable success at accounting for a variety of human

and sentence completion (Jones & Mewhort, 2007), as well
as for a range of semantic priming data (Jones, Kintsch, &
Mewhort, 2006).

structures and cue dynamics used to represent the search
process. Static models use a single cue arrangement over the
entire production interval (e.g., always using the global
context represented by frequency).
Dynamic models, by contrast, transition between local
and global cues, using the local semantic similarity retrieval
structures within a cluster1 and using the global frequencybased retrieval structure between clusters. In the case of the
Troyer et al. (1997) defined category transitions, transitions
from a local to a global cue representation occur whenever
one item is not in the same category as the previous item. In
the case of similarity drop transitions, transitions are
identified wherever a sequence of four items, A, B, C, D
have BEAGLE-defined semantic similarities that follow the
pattern S(A,B) > S(B,C), and S(B,C) < S(C,D), i.e., where
the similarity drops between clusters. In previous work, we
identified these similarity drops as places where individuals
left a patch of locally semantically similar items to
transition globally to another patch of locally semantically
similar items (Hills, Todd & Jones, 2008). Once an item
was recalled, that item was removed from the retrieval
structure. For each model, the sensitivity parameter for the
kth representation, wk, was fit separately to each participant
using the maximum likelihood method.

The Troyer et al. (1997) categorization. The Troyer et al.
(1997; see also Troyer, 2000) categorization contains 22
non-exclusive categories, including “African animals”,
“water animals”, and “beasts of burden.”
The
categorization contained 155 unique animal names, but was
extended by Hills, Todd, & Jones (2008) to contain an
additional 214 animal names found in Wikipedia. These
were categorized according to the original 22 categories
found in Troyer et al. (1997), based on the descriptions of
the additional animals found in Wikipedia. Because this
coding does not change Troyer et al.’s coding, the new
coding is fully compatible with previous results using the
Troyer et al. categorization scheme.

Modeling Search in Semantic Memory
Memory retrieval can be viewed as the result of probing a
cognitive representation with one or more cues to activate a
memory response (e.g., Gronlund & Shiffrin, 1986; Walker
& Kintsch, 1984). Under this assumption, the simplest
possible model would assume that search is guided by a
single cue. More complex models could assume that
participants use a combination of cues, or even dynamically
switch between cues as a function of retrieval success. To
model these various approaches we used a model
framework similar to the item-level recall probability
equation from SAM (see Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981):

Results
Participants produced on average 17.0 (SD = 5.35; range 5 33) animal names. As found in previous work (e.g., Troyer
et al., 1997), increased age was associated with producing
significantly fewer items (B = -0.12, t(199) = -4.83, p <
.001). Mean digit span was 16.68 (SD = 4.38), which was
also negatively correlated with age (B = -0.06, t(198) = 2.53, p = 0.01).

Table 1 presents the median improvement over a random
model in the Bayesian Information Criterion ( " BIC) as
well as the median w. The random model assumes that all
remaining items in the social network have an equal chance
to be recalled. Note that the static and dynamic models are
not strictly comparable as in order !to identify transition
points the dynamic models use information from the data
about the to-be-retrieved items. Nonetheless, the dynamic
models should outperform the static models, if transition
points are accurately identified.
Results show that the best single predictor of recoveries is
frequency, with high frequency items being more likely to
be produced than lower frequency items. Combining both
global and local information was an improvement over onecue models. Adding dynamic local-to-global transitions
based on the similarity drop model further improved the
model fit. Surprisingly, the addition of dynamic local-toglobal transitions based on the Troyer et al. (1997)

where S(Qk ,Ii ) represents the retrieval strength from cue Qk
to item Ii in memory. wk represents the saliency or attention
directed at the kth cue. Two cue categories were considered:
a global context cue and a local cue representing the most
recently recalled item. The context cue amounts to the
global strength of each item in the category of “animals that
you know”, and represents the cue for global search; we
assume that this is best approximated by a retrieval structure
based on the frequency of occurrence of each animal name
in the Wikipedia corpus. The cue representing the most
recently recalled item represents the cue for local search.
For local search, we assume a retrieval structure that is
determined by the pairwise semantic similarities produced
by BEAGLE. Note that each of the retrieval structures
(representing either frequency or semantic similarity) is a
matrix providing the retrieval strength for each possible cue
with all possible animals that could be produced. Thus,
given a set of cues and a set of retrieval structures, we can
compute the predicted retrieval probability for any sequence
of animal names.
Using this framework, we tested several static and
dynamic models that differed in terms of the retrieval

and thus may not represent a second search component as
proposed by Troyer et al. (1997), but simply the outcome of
a single slower production rate, consistent with Mayr
(2002).
A potentially more meaningful correlation with age is to
look at the number of switches/item. These are weakly
correlated with total number of productions (for similarity
drop switches, Pearson’s product-moment correlation = 0.17, t(199)=-2.50, p < 0.05; for Troyer et al switches,
Pearson’s product moment-correlation = -0.21, t(199)=3.07, p < 0.01). A negative correlation indicates that more
productions are associated with fewer switches per item,
which may indicate that participants who produce more
items do so by producing items that are, on average, more
similar to one another.

The second column in Table 2 shows that switches-peritem is positively correlated with age for the similarity drop
switches, but not for the Troyer et al. switches. Figure 1
shows the switches per item for younger and older groups
using a median split (Median = 68), with fewer switches
per item for younger versus older individuals (t(199) = 2.67, p < .01). This is inconsistent with the Troyer et al.
account of switching, which suggests that older adults
switch less often between representations, but as argued
below is consistent with an account that assumes increased
switching is associated with executive deficits.

Switches from BEAGLE similarity drop and Troyer et al
are significantly correlated with one another, (Pearson’s
correlation coefficient = 0.61, t(199)=10.99, p < 0.001).
There are a mean of 5.14 similarity drop switches per item,
and a mean of 9.24 Troyer et al. switches (paired-t-test,
t(200)=-23.63, p < 0.001).
Overall, these results are supportive of a dynamic process,
in which people dynamically switch between global
(frequency) and local (item) cues to search memory. The
location of transition points was, however, better predicted
by the similarity drop model than it was by a model using
the transitions proposed by Troyer et al. (1997).

Is Dynamic Switching Correlated with Individual
Differences in Executive Processing?
One alternative view to Troyer et al.’s (1997) proposition
that age-related executive deficits lead to reduced switching
between representations is that the use of local cues in
memory retrieval is a demanding process that involves
focusing attention on item-level information and/or
inhibiting global information. Accordingly, executive and
attentional deficits could lead to a significant increase in
switching between the use of a default global cue and the
cognitively demanding use of local, item-based ones. As a
consequence, the effect of age should be similar or amount
to the effect of reduced cognitive abilities, such that reduced
fluid abilities lead to increased switching between global
and local memory cues. A multiple regression predicting
similarity drop switches per item results in a significant
effect for both digit span (B = -0.002, t(197)=-2.42, p =
0.02) and age (B = 0.0006, t(197) = 2.27, p = 0.02). Figure 2
shows the regression line for digit span on switches per
item. That is, individuals with higher digit spans have fewer
switches per item; younger individuals also have fewer
switches per item. Moreover, the effect of age remains
significant even after controlling for the effect of digit span,

Is Dynamic Switching Correlated with Age?
Both the absolute number of Troyer et al. (1997) switches
and the BEAGLE-defined similarity drop switches are
correlated with age (first column in Table 2), with older
individuals switching less often in absolute number than
younger individuals. However, the number of switches is
strongly correlated with the total number of productions (for
Troyer et al. (1997) switches: Pearson’s correlation
coefficient = 0.74, t(199) = 15.60, p < .001; Similarity drop
switches: Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.88, t(199) =
26.31, p < .001). This produces an obvious confound, as
switches may occur at regular intervals during production,

994

deficits are confined to slower production rates due to
general age-related slowing (Mayr, 2002; Mayr & Kliegl,
2000) because we find links between age and the pattern of
cue use in dynamic search from memory. The results also
go beyond the idea that age-related cognitive decline in
executive function (Bäckman et al., 2000; Volkow, et al.
1998) is associated with decreased switching between
representations when searching for items in semantic space
(Troyer, Moscovitch, & Winocur, 1997). We do replicate
the finding that age is negatively correlated with the total
number of switches between categories. However, this
measure may be a poor indicator of dynamic search
processes because it is strongly correlated with the total
number of productions.
More interestingly, our modeling results suggest that agerelated cognitive decline is associated with increased
switching between memory cues. Our results show that the
number of switches between global and local cues per item
produced increased with age. The number of switches
between global and local cues per item produced was also
correlated with a measure of digit span—with more
switching correlated with lower spans. This is consistent
with prior models of working memory and executive
processing as representing a measure of the ability to inhibit
distracting information (Kane & Engle, 2004).
The perspective of an executive search process that directs
search may help reinterpret some previous findings in the
field of aging. If executive processing represents the ability
to focus on a specific subgoal, then aging and/or reduced
cognitive ability would lead to a greater likelihood of
switching between subgoals, or terminating search
processes. According to this view, previous work showing
less information search in older adults (Louâpre, van
Alphen, & Pierre, 2010; Mata, Wilke, & Czienskowski,
2009; Mata & Nunes, 2010) could be interpreted as
resulting from greater switching between subgoals in a
hierarchical subgoal process, leading to earlier termination
of the search (Hills et al., 2010). Thus, exploration is
potentially a confusing term because it confounds the time
spent searching and the pattern of search. While the time
spent searching represents persistence on one goal (i.e.,
searching), switching between areas of local processing
represents switching between subgoals—i.e., earlier subgoal
abandonment—and thus lack of persistence. We hope that
the use of detailed and formal models like the one proposed
here will help shed light on these issues and provide new
insights into how aging impacts exploration in memory
search.

The current work attempted to contribute to our
understanding of adult development changes in semantic
search. We used a formal model of memory (Raaijmakers &
Shiffrin, 1981) to model semantic search processes of adults
aged between 29 to 99 years of age in the animal naming
task (“name all the animals you can”; Thurstone, 1938).
Overall, our results support the idea that people transition
between local and global cues when searching long-term
memory. Specifically, our model searching over a semantic
representation based on BEAGLE (Jones & Mewhort, 2004)
provides a plausible account of search in memory in this
task and, further, is consistent with previous work
suggesting that people switch between global frequencybased retrieval cues and local item-based retrieval cues to
navigate their semantic memory (e.g., Raaijmakers &
Shiffrin, 1981; Gruenewald & Lockhead, 1980).
