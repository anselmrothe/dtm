According to the bottleneck theory a smaller AB should
be observed in the easy T1 condition, whereas the
attention capture hypothesis carries the opposite
prediction. Experiment 1 is subdivided into Experiment
1A and 1B, which differs by the presence or absence of
T1’s mask respectively. T1’s mask is omitted in
Experiment 1B because we are uncertain of how it affects
the AB under these conditions. In Experiment 2 we use
additive Gaussian noise to targets and aim to keep T1
difficulty constant between two conditions but vary T1
contrast. If T1 saliency is varied by this T1 contrast
manipulation, we may tease apart the effect of T1 capture
from the effect of T1 difficulty. According to the
bottleneck theory, no difference in AB effect should be
observed between T1 conditions since difficulty is kept
constant. The attention capture hypothesis however
