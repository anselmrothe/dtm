Gelman & Markman, 1986; Murphy, 2003; Waxman &
Braun, 2005; Yamauchi & Yu, 2008). When physical
similarity of stimuli was pitted against shared category
labels, participants tended to judge that shared category
labels are more important than shared physical features in
predicting characteristics of the objects (Gelman &
Markman, 1986; Yamauchi & Yu, 2008). The other
dominant view, the label-as-feature hypothesis, argues that
there is no indication that people have such a naïve theory
about category labels (Anderson, 1990; Sloutsky & Fisher,
2004). According to this view, matching labels increase the
perception of overall similarity just like matching physical
features do. In both the naïve-theory and label-as-feature
hypotheses, category labels are expected to influence
inductive generalization. However, the naïve theory
approach argues that labels are used to form naïve
assumptions, while the label-as-feature approach suggests
that labels are used as a feature.
This article attempted to find the boundary conditions
where these two conflicting views can complement each
other. We suggest that these two conflicting views can
complement each other with respect to two types of general
knowledge that an observer has – domains of categories and
the amount of categorical knowledge. Previous studies have
shown that people have general awareness of how living
things and man-made objects differ, and the two broad
categories of concepts seem to be separate in our semantic
knowledge (Caramazza & Mahon, 2003; Moss, Tyler,
Durrant-Peatifield & Bunn, 1998; McRae, Cree, Seidenberg,
& McNorgan, 2005). Studies also suggest that the amount
of knowledge is one important variable of the labeling
effect. For example, subjects who do not have much
specialized domain knowledge tend to make inferences
about unfamiliar diseases using taxonomic relations, while
experts employ causal, anatomical, and ecological variables
to make inferences (Lopez, Atran, Coley, Medin, & Smith,
1997; Shafto & Coley, 2003).

Abstract
Category labels are known to guide inductive generalizations by
modifying the representation of stimuli (i.e., the labeling effect);
yet, the mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. One view

suggests that shared category labels increase overall
similarity between items as shared physical features do. The
other view suggests that category labels are qualitatively
different from category features, as category labels help
integrate prior knowledge. The present study examined these
two competing views with respect to two types of background
knowledge – domains of categories (living things vs. man-made
objects) and the amount of knowledge (the number of listed
exemplars). The results from two experiments suggest that
category labels are likely to be used as features for man-made
objects, while category labels help create a naïve assumption for
living things, implicating that similarity-based statistical processes
and knowledge-based structured processes are employed
interactively to cope with different domains of knowledge.
Keywords: Category Labels; Background Knowledge,
Inductive Inference

One critical question in inductive generalization research is
how the similarity-based statistical mechanism (e.g., Rodger
& McClelland, 2003; Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004) and
structured prior knowledge (e.g., intuitive theories and
assumptions about domain knowledge) interact (Gelman &
Heyman, 1999; Markman & Ross, 2003; Medin, Coley,
Storms & Hayes, 2003; Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2003;
Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2009; Yamauchi, 2009). The former
provides a vehicle for detecting association of stimuli, and
the latter offers boundaries on the search space. The two
have to work together but how? When does one strategy
become dominant while the other is relegated to the
background?
This article examines the capacity of shared category
labels. Studies have shown that when two objects carry the
same label, we tend to assume that these objects have some
important characteristics in common; when objects carry
different labels, we tend to think that they have some
distinctive characteristics (i.e., labeling effect) (Gelman &
Heyman, 1999; Gelman & Markman, 1986; Lupyan, 2008;
Murphy, 2003; Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004; Waxman & Braun,
2005; Yamauchi & Yu, 2008; Yu, Yamauchi &
Schumatcher, 2008). To explain the labeling effect,
researchers suggested two hypotheses: the naïve-theory
hypothesis and the label-as-feature hypothesis. The naïvetheory hypothesis states that people tend to make an
intuitive assumption that category labels are qualitatively
different from physical features (Gelman & Heyman, 1999;

Hypothesis and Predictions
Natural kind categories are highly correlated in their
attributes as compared to artifacts (Malt & Smith, 1984;
McRae & Siderberg, 1998), and correlated features are the
critical factor that promotes category-based induction
(Sloman, Love, & Ahn, 1998; Gelman, 1988). In this
regard, we predict that the labeling effect is particularly
strong when labels represent living things as opposed to
man-made objects. If the labeling effect arises because
people treat labels as a feature, the labeling effect would be

813

contingent on the amount of knowledge that an observer has.
In contrast, if the labeling effect arises from people’s naïve
assumptions, the labeling effect would be relatively
independent from the amount of knowledge that an observer
has. We suggest that for concepts representing living things,
people have a naïve assumption that category labels are
special; thus, we predict that a strong labeling effect would
emerge for concepts related to living things. Here, we
expect that the labeling effect is relatively independent of
the amount of knowledge that an observer has. In contrast,
for man-made objects, we suggest that people treat category
labels as a feature. Thus, we predict that the labeling effect
observed for the man-made objects would be related to the
amount of knowledge an observer has.
Two experiments were conducted to test this idea.
Labeling effect was measured in a triad-based similarity
judgment task (e.g., Gelman & Markman, 1986; Sloutsky &
Fisher, 2004; Yu, Yamauchi & Schumatcher, 2008).
Participants were presented with three pictures of animal
tissues a target placed at the top and two base pictures
placed at the bottom (Figure 1), Their task was to decide
which base picture, left or right, was more similar to the
original picture (i.e. a triad task). In each stimulus frame,
one base picture was more similar to the target than the
other base picture (Figure 1; later the more similar base
picture is called the similar base picture; the less
similarthus more dissimilarbase picture is called
dissimilar base picture). The similar base picture always had
a different label from the target, and the dissimilar base
picture always had the same label as the target (Figure 1).
Thus, the labeling effect was measured by the proportion of
participants selecting dissimilar base pictures (that has the
same label as the target) as more similar to the target
picture. For example, in Figure 1, we examined the
proportion of participants selecting the picture on the right
(i.e., dissimilar base picture) as more similar to the target
than the picture on the left.

Experiment 1
To compare labeling effect of living things and man-made
objects, we used descriptive labels as a means of
manipulating the type of categories. Throughout the
experiment, the same set of pictures was presented to
participants with the same set of arbitrary nonsensical labels
(e.g., “Dalica,” or “Goyama”). The type of category
associated with the labels was manipulated solely in the
instructions that participants received in each condition. In
the diseased cell condition, participants were told that the
pictures were diseased cells and the labels (e.g., “Goyama”)
represented names of diseases. In the painting style
condition, participants were told that pictures represented
abstract paintings and that the labels (e.g., “Goyama”)
indicated the names of painting styles. In the painter
condition, participants were told that the pictures
represented paintings and that labels (e.g., “Goyama”)
referred to the painters’ names. Note that in the painter
condition, labels were indexical in the sense that the label
indicated a painter who created the given pictures; however,
in the painting style condition, labels were categorical
because the label represented a painting style that could
include other paintings that were drawn by many painters in
that style.
As previous studies suggested, the amount of knowledge
can be one important factor in explaining labeling effect
(Lopez, Atran, Coley, Medin, & Smith, 1997; Shafto &
Coley, 2003). One way to capture the amount of background
knowledge is to ask participants to list as many exemplars
of a category as possible (Barsalou, 1985; Smith, Ward,
Tindell, Sifonis, & Wilkenfeld, 2000; Ward, Patterson,
Sifonis, Dodds, & Saunders, 2002). Folwing a procedure a
previous study suggested (Smith et al., 2000), we asked
participants to list as many exemplars as possible associated
with the categories (diseases, painting styles, or painters)
after the similarity judgment task. The amount of knowledge
was measured by counting the number of exemplars that
each participant generated.

Method
Participants A total of 304 undergraduates participated for
course credit. They were randomly assigned to one of three
conditions: diseased cell (n = 93), painting style (n = 106),
and painter (n = 105) conditions.
Materials Stimuli were triads of monochrome pictures
(Figure 2). The target was an original picture of animal
tissues, and the two base pictures were of morphed images
of two original pictures. Five pairs of original cell pictures
were selected from a well-known textbook of veterinary
histology (Bacha & Bacha, 2000). From these 10 pictures,
five pairs were created. For each pair, one original tissue
picture was merged with the other original picture to 18
different degrees using MorphMan 4.0 (2003) software.
Altogether, 90 morphed pictures (18 morphed pictures from
each of five pairs) were created.

814

and were combined with one of two original pictures in each
pair, yielding 12 triads for each pair (a total of 60 triads = 5
pairs × 12 triads).
Design The experiment had a 2 (Label Condition; no-label
vs. same-label conditions; between-subjects) × 3 (Physical
Difference; low-, medium-, or high-difference; withinsubjects) factorial design. The dependent measure was the
proportion of participants selecting the dissimilar base
pictures as more similar to the target than the other base
pictures.
Procedure Participants were presented with 60 triads of
pictures one at a time and judged which base picture was
more similar to the target using left or right arrow key (EPrime 1.1, Psychology Software Tools Inc., 2002). The
order of presenting stimuli was determined randomly. The
dissimilar base picture was presented on the left or the right
side an equal number of times. The experiment lasted about
10 minutes. After carrying out the similarity judgment task,
participants were asked to list as many exemplars of the
category as possible in 2 minutes. Participants in the
diseased cell condition were asked to list disease names,
participants in the painting style condition were asked to list
names of painting style (e.g., impressionist paintings,
classical painting, etc.), and participants in the painter
condition were asked to list names of painters.

Results & Discussion

Figure 3: Results from Experiment 1
Figure 3 summarizes the main results from Experiment 1.
When the labels indicated living things (diseased cell
condition), participants used the labels significantly more
often than when the labels represented man-made things
(painter and painter style condition) (Figure 3). The main
effect of label condition was significant, F(2, 301) = 4.22,
MSE = .08, p = .01, η2 = .03. The proportion of participants
selecting the dissimilar base pictures was significantly
higher in the diseased cell condition (M = 0.26) than in the
painting style condition (M = 0.21) or the painter condition
(M = 0.19): diseased cell vs. painting style, t (197) = 2.02,
SE = .03, p = .05, d = 0.29, diseased cell vs. painter, t (196)
= 2.68, SE = .02, p < .01, d = 0.38. The labeling effect
between the painting style and painter conditions was

Figure 2: Three levels of physical difference. (a) lowdifference, (b) medium- difference, (c) high-difference
From the morphed pictures, three levels of physical
difference―low-, medium-, and high-difference―were
created based on the degree of merging of the two original
pictures (Figure 2). In the low-difference condition, the
target picture and the dissimilar base picture were not very
different (Figure 2a); in the medium-difference condition,
the target picture and the dissimilar base picture were
moderately different (Figure 2b); and in the high-difference
condition, the target picture and the dissimilar base picture
were highly different (Figure 2c). Two sets of base pictures
were randomly selected at each level of physical difference

that real abstract paintings were used as stimuli in
Experiment 2.
The idea that a naïve assumption is formed for category
labels representing living things predict that the labeling
effect should be still strong in the disease cell condition as
compared to the painter and painting style conditions, even
though the stimuli used in Experiment 2 barely resemble
biological cells. The hypothesis that labels are treated like
features for artifact concepts suggests that the amount of
background knowledge affects the painter condition and
painting style condition but not the disease cell condition.

statistically indistinguishable, t (209) = .63, SE = .02, p =
.53, d = 0.09. The results suggest that, at least for the manmade objects, categorical labels (painting style condition)
are not considered more special than indexical labels
(painter condition). There was no interaction effect of
physical difference and label condition, F(2,392) < 1.0.
Participants knew more about diseases than about
painters/painting styles (Table 1). As participants listed
more disease names (M = 9.47, SD = 3.72) than painting
style names (M = 4.64, SD = 2.36) and painter names (M =
3.22, SD = 2.35), The number of exemplars participants
listed for disease names, painting style names, and painter
names was significantly different from each other, F(2, 301)
= 129.42, MSE = 8.07, p < .01, η2 = .46. More disease
names were generated than names of painting styles or
painter names, diseases vs. painting styles, t (197) = 11.09,
SE = .44, p = .001, d = 1.58, diseases vs. painters, t (196) =
14.32, SE = .44, p < .001, d = 2.04. Also, more painting
styles were generated than painter names, t (209) = 4.39, SE
= .33, p < .001, d = 0.60.

Participants Three hundred eighty-seven undergraduates
participated for course credit. They were randomly assigned
to one of three conditions: diseased cell (n = 130), painting
style (n = 121), and painter (n = 136) conditions.

Figure 4: Sample trial shown in Experiment 2

The labeling effect might have been in the disease
condition because our participants knew more about disease
cells than painter names and painting style. Thus we
performed ANCOVA with the number of listed exemplars
as a covariate. The result show that even after the amount of
background knowledge (i.e., the number of exemplars
associated with labels) was controlled, the difference
between the diseased cell, the painting style and painter
conditions remained robust: F(2, 300) = 2.84, MSE = .08, p
= .06, η2 = .02. The results suggest that, at least for diseases,
labels are used as a type of naïve assumption rather than a
part of attributional information/knowledge people have.
In Experiment 1, the stimuli were produced by morphing
pictures of animal tissues; thus it is possible that participants
did not use labels in the painting style condition and the
painter condition because these stimuli did not look like
actual paintings. Therefore, Experiment 2 tested with stimuli
obtained from real paintings.

Materials Five pairs of abstract paintings were selected
from various websites. The procedure of creating 60 triads
of original and morphed pictures (see Figure 2 for the
sample trial) was identical to the procedure described in
Experiment 1. As in the previous experiment, the triads of
pictures had three levels of physical difference (low-,
medium-, and high-difference).
Design & Procedure The design and procedure of
Experiment 2 was identical to those described in
Experiment 1. Participants were presented with the same 60
triads of paintings with labels and were asked to judge
which base picture was more similar to the target.
Participants in the diseased cell condition were instructed
that the stimuli were cell pictures infected by diseases and
that the labels specified the names of the diseases that
infected the cells. Participants in the painting style condition
were informed that the stimuli were paintings and that the
labels indicated the names of painting styles. Participants in
the painter condition were also told that the stimuli were
paintings and that the labels indicated the painters’ names.
As in Experiment 1, participants were asked to judge
similarity of pictures and then to list as many exemplars of
the category as possible right after the similarity judgment

Experiment 2
The goal of Experiment 2 is to replicate the results of
Experiment 1 using a different set of pictures (Figure 4).
One possible explanation for the differential effect of labels
in Experiment 1 is that the stimuli looked more like cells
than paintings. Experiment 2 was designed to rule out this
explanation. The design, task, and materials in Experiment 2
were identical to those described in Experiment 1, except

816

task. All participants received the same stimuli with the
same label names. The meanings of labels were manipulated
only in the instructions.

We hypothesized that people would treat category labels
special for living things thus labeling effect would be
relatively independent from the amount of knowledge.
There was no correlation between the listed exemplars and
the labeling effect in the disease cell condition, r(128) = .04, p = .64. The labeling effect in the disease-cell condition
was strong even after controlling the amount of knowledge
they had. ANCOVA by controlling the number of listed
exemplars as a covariate showed that even when the number
of listed exemplars was controlled, the difference between
the diseased cell and the painter and painting style
conditions remained strong, F(2, 383) = 6.88, MSE = 0.05, p
= .001, η2 = .04.
We also hypothesized that people would treat category
labels as a type of feature for man-made objects, thus the
labeling effect would be related to the amount of knowledge.
A correlation analysis revealed that there was a significant
negative correlation between the amount of background
knowledge (i.e., the number of exemplars listed by
participants) and the amount of labeling effect (i.e., the
proportion of participants selecting the dissimilar pictures)
for man-made objects (painters, painting styles), r(255) = .16, p = .01. This result is consistent with the general
finding that the labeling effect is higher when background
knowledge is limited, suggesting that given man-made
objects, people tend to use labels when they did not know
much about the category. However, this is not the case in
the living-thing concepts.
Note that participants in Experiment 2 judged the stimuli
more likely to be abstract paintings than animal cells. After
the similarity judgment task, participants in the diseased cell
and painter conditions viewed 10 original painting stimuli
one at a time and rated the extent to which the pictures
actually looked like diseased cells or paintings. Participants
in the diseased cell condition estimated the likelihood of
each original painting stimulus to be a disease cell with a 0100 scale. Participants in the painter condition estimated the
likelihood of each original painting stimulus to be a painting
with a 0-100 scale. The average rating score in the painting
style condition (M = 62.37) was significantly higher than
that in the diseased cell condition (M = 48.82), t(221) =
7.84, p < .001, suggesting that the proportion of participants
who considered the stimuli to be actual “paintings” was
much higher than the proportion of participants who
considered the stimuli to be “cells.”

Results

Figure 5: Results from Experiment 2
Though pictures shown in Experiment 2 barely resemble
biological cells, when labels represented living things
(diseased cell condition), participants used the labels
considerably more often than when the labels indicated
man-made objects (painter and painting style conditions)
(Figure 5). The main effect of label condition was
significant, F (2, 384) = 5.24, MSE = 0.05, p = .006, η2 =
.03. The proportion of participants selecting the dissimilar
base pictures (the tendency to use category labels) was
significantly higher in the diseased cell condition (M = 0.21)
than in the painting style condition (M = 0.16) or in the
painter condition (M = 0.16): diseased cell vs. painting style,
t (249) = 2.30, SE = .02, p = .02, d = .29; diseased cell vs.
painter condition, t (264) = 2.80, SE = .02, p = .006, d = .34.
The proportion of selecting dissimilar base pictures was not
different in the painting style condition compared to the
painter condition, t (255) = 0.38, SE = .01, p = .71, d = .05.
As in Experiment 1, participants listed more disease
names (M = 9.69, SD = 3.65) than painting style names (M
= 4.74, SD = 2.41) and painter names (M = 3.54, SD = 2.67)
; F(2, 384) = 159.09, MSE = 8.73, p < .001, η2 = .45.
Participants listed significantly more disease names than
painting style names, t (249) = 12.20, SE = .41, p < .001, d =
1.54; they generated significantly more disease names than
painter names, t (264) = 16.27, SE = .38, p < .001, d = 2.00.
They also listed significantly more painting style names
than painter names, t (255) = 3.76, SE = .32, p < .001, d =
.47.

General Discussion
How are labels used in inductive generalization? The results
from present study indicated that category labels are used
more for predictions of living things than for man-made
objects, and this tendency is relatively separated from the
amount of knowledge. However, for man-made objects, the
tendency to use category labels is related to the amount of
knowledge (the amount of listed examples) a participant
possesses, and there is no clear distinction between category
labels and indexical labels. Experiment 1 showed that
people use category labels in inductive inference of living

things more than man-made objects. Also the tendency to
use labels was relatively independent of the amount of
knowledge. Results of Experiment 2 also showed that, when
using real paintings, the amount of knowledge was
negatively correlated with the tendency to use category
labels on similarity judgments involving man-made objects
(i.e., paintings). The relation between the amount of
knowledge and the tendency to use labels was absent in the
disease condition. These results suggest that types of
knowledge and the amount of knowledge interacted with the
labeling effect.
The current finding extends the naïve theory-based
account and similarity-based views of inductive inference.
The naïve theory approach suggests that people form a naive
assumption that shared category membership is qualitatively
different from physical features (Gelman & Heyman, 1999;
Gelman & Markman, 1986; Lupyan, 2008; Murphy, 2003;
Rhemtulla & Hall, 2008; Waxman & Braun, 2005;
Yamauchi & Yu, 2008; Yamauchi & Yu , 2008; Yamauchi
& Yu, 2008; Yu et al., 2008). The similarity-based approach
argues that people treat shared labels the same as other
shared features (Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004; Sloutsky, Kloos
& Fisher, 2007). Our findings suggest that the naïve
assumption and similarity jointly influence the labeling
effect depending of types of categories (living things vs.
man-made objects) and the amount of knowledge (number
of listed exemplars). For living things, the labeling effect
was strong and relatively independent from the amount of
knowledge; for man-made objects however, the labeling
effect was weak and depended on the amount of knowledge.
The results suggest that people are willing to evaluate
shared category labels as a type of feature for man-made
objects more than for living things.
