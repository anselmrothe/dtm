Abstract
Navigation strategy is an important component of spatial
navigation. In the present study, we developed an assessment of
human navigation strategy using a virtual analog of an
assessment of animal navigation strategy. We examined the
relationship between age, sex, and navigation strategy
preference on subsequent performance of the virtual Morris
Water Task (vMWT). On our novel assessment of navigation
strategy, individuals were highly consistent in preferring either
an allocentric or egocentric strategy. There were also substantial
group differences in strategy preference with older adults
overwhelmingly preferring an egocentric strategy, while
younger adults were evenly divided between strategies. There
were no significant sex differences in navigation strategy. On
subsequent vMWT testing, allocentric strategy preference was
associated with more accurate probe trial performance and
enhanced cognitive mapping. These results suggest that human
navigation strategy can be assessed reliably and that these
strategy preferences feed forward to influence performance on
independent navigation tasks.

Introduction
Age and sex differences are commonly found in both human
and animal models of navigation performance (Barnes et al.
1980; Driscoll et al. 2005; Ingram 1988; McLay et al. 1999;
Moffat et al. 2001; Newman and Kaszniak 2000; Wilkniss
et al. 1997).
The hippocampus (HC) is part of a wide network of
structures involved in spatial navigation, and has been
consistently demonstrated to play a role in
allocentric/world-centered spatial processing. Conversely,
egocentric/self-centered processing is thought to involve

primarily parietal cortex and caudate nucleus (Bohbot et al
2007; Maguire et al. 1998). Functional neuroimaging
studies have demonstrated that older adult humans show
less HC involvement during spatial navigation than do
younger adults (Meulenbroek et al. 2004; Moffat et al.
2006; Antonova et al. 2009).
In younger adults, it is
thought that HC differences between males and females
might underlie the widely reported finding of better male
performance on spatial tasks (Astur et al., 1998).
Some researchers have theorized that reduced HC
involvement in navigation in older adults might reflect
changes in navigation strategy as older adults adopt extrahippocampal strategies. (Moffat et al. 2007; Moffat et al.
2006; Iaria et al. 2009). Some preliminary evidence
supports this perspective. Driscoll et al. (2005) found that
self-reported allocentric strategy use declined with age.
Barnes and Colleagues (1980) investigated age
differences in navigation strategy using a rat model in a
modified T-maze. Rats were placed in one arm of the Tmaze, and one of the remaining two arms was baited. The
researchers included three types of cues in the environment
that the rats could have used to learn the position of the
goal: allocentric, based on objects in the environment,
egocentric, based on the path taken by the rat, and cue,
which took the form of a textured mat. Rats were trained to
a criterion level of performance that demonstrated they had
learned to reach the goal. Barnes then performed probe trials
in which one of the cues was rotated 180 degrees. If the rat
changed its path to “follow” the rotated cue, they were
considered to be using that strategy.
Multiple probes were completed, and Barnes and
colleagues were able to calculate probabilities for strategy
preference for each group. Older rats were more likely than

tasks including sample training paths

middle-aged rats to prefer an egocentric strategy, while the
reverse was true for allocentric strategy. Cue strategy was
almost never used by the animals.
Some studies have attempted to use similar methods in
human models (Iaria et al. 2003; Bohbot et al., 2007;
Schmitzer-Torbert, 2007), and some have found group
differences in navigation strategy.
Schmitzer-Torbert
(2007) found some evidence for sex differences in
navigation strategy with males preferring an egocentric
strategy and females preferring no strategy Furthermore,
they are in the opposite direction of another study on sex
differences in navigation strategy (Levy et el., 2005).
Bohbot and colleagues (2007) have conducted a number of
studies on the relevance of navigation strategy to functional
activation patterns and the volume of various brain
structures, finding a relationship between both volume and
activity in the hippocampus and allocentric strategy, as well
as a relationship between both volume and activity in the
caudate nucleus and an egocentric strategy.
One classic test of human and animal navigation is the
Morris Water Task (MWT; Morris et al. 1982). The MWT
and its human analogue the virtual Morris Water Task
(vMWT) require participants to find a hidden platform in a
circular arena. The platform is always in the same location,
but participant start position varies from trial to trial. It is
best solved by using an allocentric strategy as there are
multiple stable cues scattered throughout the environment.
This is by far the most widely used test for navigation
ability, and its status as a test of allocentric navigation
suggests that individuals who prefer an allocentric strategy
in a task such as Barnes‟ T-maze may perform better in the
MWT.
The present study developed a navigation strategy
assessment for humans, used that strategy assessment to
demonstrate group differences in navigation strategy, and
showed that this preference was related to navigation
performance on another task.

Methods
Participants
45 older adults (60-85) and 54 younger adults (18-35) were
recruited from the Metropolitan Detroit community and the
Wayne State Psychology subject pool. Participants were
required to be free of physiological, neurological, or
psychological disorders.

Virtual Environments
All virtual environments (VE) were created using Unreal
Tournament 2003 modified for use in navigation
experiments (Epic Games, Rockville, MD). All
environments were run on a PC and presented on a 19"
monitor approximately 20" away from the face in a dark
room. Participants interacted with the virtual environment
using a commercially available joystick (Thrustmaster Top

Gun Fox 2 Pro, Guillemot Corporation, La Gacilly Cedex,
France).
All participants received joystick/VE familiarization
training before the test. Additionally, a speed test was
administered in which all participants were required to meet
a threshold proficiency at moving through a twisting virtual
hallway. Participants repeated the task until they completed
it at threshold levels (<120 s).

Virtual Y-Maze Strategy Assessment (vYSA)
Following Barnes et al. (1980), we developed a strategy
assessment that could be used to determine navigation
strategy preferences in humans. Five Y-maze environments
were developed that could be completed equally well
through the use of either an allocentric or egocentric
strategy. Each maze had both a stable route, providing
egocentric cues, and stable extra-maze objects throughout
the environment, which provided allocentric cues.
Participants were told only how to know when they had
completed the task correctly (hearing a major guitar chord)
and that their task was to complete the task correctly as
many times as possible. Participants who asked for
additional instruction were not provided any additional
information. This was done to prevent experimenters from
using keywords such as „place‟ or „route‟ that might bias
participants towards one strategy or another. During the
training trials participants started at a given location and
moved to a goal area. When participants entered the correct
goal area, the pleasing tone sounded, whereas, a noxious
buzzer sounded when participants entered the incorrect goal
position. Training continued until participants reached a
criterion level of 5 consecutive successful learning trials.
See figure 1 for a diagram of this procedure.
For the probe trial, participants were placed at a third
position that was neither the starting location nor the goal
location for preceding training trials (figure 2). Participants
were allowed to move to whichever goal position they
preferred, at which point neither tone sounded.
The vYSA probe trial was designed to determine
allocentric or egocentric strategy preference. Participants
who, during the probe, followed the same route they learned
in training, regardless of absolute location (e.g. turn right),
were classified as using an egocentric strategy. Participants
who moved to the same absolute location as trained in the
learning trials, even though it required taking a different
route were classified as using an allocentric strategy for that
trial.
Participants during prior pilot testing verbally
indicated that they had noticed the change that occurred
during the probe trial no matter what strategy they preferred,
indicating that a participant who chose an egocentric
strategy did so knowing that the environment had changed,
though we did not directly assess this in the present study.
This process was completed 5 times. In order to be
considered as preferring one strategy, participants were
required to demonstrate the same strategy preference in at
least 4 out of 5 blocks. Participants who did not prefer one

strategy over another in 4 out of 5 blocks (N = 13) were
excluded from analysis.

Virtual Morris Water Task (vMWT)
The vMWT replicated the classic Morris Water Task
(Morris et al., 1982) in a virtual environment.
Participants completed 10 learning trials followed by one
probe trial. For all trials, participants navigated through a
circular pool contained in a large, non-symmetrical virtual
room. Four objects were situated close to the edge of the
pool, and two objects or features were situated more distally
in the environment. For learning trials, participants were
placed in the environment randomly at one of six potential
starting positions inside the pool area. Participants were
instructed that their goal was to find a hidden platform.
When located, the platform lifted participants out of the
water, accompanied by a pleasing tone. If the participant
did not find the platform after 90s, a discordant buzzer tone
sounded, the participants were frozen in place, and
participants were allowed to look around the environment,
followed by the beginning of the next trial. The dependent
variable on the learning trials was the latency to reach the
platform on each trial.

In the probe trial, the platform was removed and
participants began at one of the six starting locations and
were instructed to locate the platform. Unlike training
trials, the platform did not rise out of the water when
occupied. When this occurs, participants typically assume
they have made an error and attempt to cross the platform
again, often multiple times. After 90 s the probe trial ended.
Dependent variable on the probe trial was the number of
platform intersections (number of times the participant
crossed over the location that previously contained the
platform).
Following the probe trial, participants were given three
versions of an overhead map of the virtual environment and
asked to mark with an „X‟ where they believed the center of
the platform to be located. The maps included a complete
overhead map, a map in which only objects (and not room
geometry) were shown, and a map in which only room
geometry (and not objects) was shown. Platform placement
error was operationalized as absolute distance from the
correct center of the platform (in mm). Both platform
crossings and error in placement of the platform on a map of
the environment are specifically measures that have been
used in the past to infer the degree to which participants
were using an allocentric strategy, which is why they were
chosen as the dependent variables of interest for this study.

Results
Age Differences in Strategy Preference
To investigate age differences in strategy preference, a X2
test of independence was performed on age and strategy
selection (Figure 3). Strategy preference varied by age
group (X2 = 12.43, p < .001) with older adults preferring an

evenly divided between ego and allocentric preference.
Using Cramer‟s V we determined that this age difference
was of a very large effect size (Cramer‟s V= .38).

Sex Differences in Strategy Preference
A X2 test of independence was performed on sex and
strategy preference (Figure 4). Strategy did not differ as a
function of sex (X2 = .003, p = .96). A very small effect size
suggests that this negative finding was not due to
insufficient statistical power.

Cognitive Mapping

Effects of Age and Strategy Preference on vMWT
learning trials
The relationship between age, sex, and strategy preference
on vMWT performance was investigated using a 2 (young
v. old) by 2 (male v. female) by 2 (egocentric v. allocentric)
Analysis of Variance. There was a main effect of age,
F(1,85) = 6.04, p = .02; older adult latency to complete the
vMWT (M = 35.68, SD = 15.67) was greater than that of
younger adults who preferred an allocentric strategy on the
vYSA completed the vMWT learning trials faster, on
average, than all other groups. There was also a main effect
for age, with older adults taking more time to complete the
task than younger adults (M = 26.67, SD = 14.69). There
was no significant effect of sex, F(1,85) = .66, p = .42, or
strategy preference, F(1,85) = .60, p = .44.
An Age and strategy preference interaction was detected
for vMWT performance F(1,85) = 4.78, p = .03 (Figure 5).
Allocentric preferring young adults (M = 21.26, SD =
10.81) displayed lower completion latencies than egocentric
preferring young adults (M = 32.10, SD = 16.67),
allocentric preferring older adults (M = 38.26, SD = 16.19)
and egocentric preferring older adults (M = 33.10, SD =
15.73)

Probe Trial—Platform Crossings

Function of Age and Strategy Preference.

An investigation of the relationship between age, sex, and
strategy preference on probe performance on the vMWT
was completed using a 2 (young v. old) by 2 (male v.
female) by 2 (egocentric v. allocentric) ANOVA with
platform crossings during probe trial as the dependent
variable There was a main effect of strategy preference,
F(1,85) = 5.42, p = .02. Participants who preferred an
allocentric strategy (M = 4.50, SD = 2.51) crossed the
platform more times than participants who preferred an
egocentric strategy (M = 3.13, SD = 2.03). There was no
main effect for age, F(1,85) = 1.03, p = .31, or sex, F(1,85)
= 2.27, p = .14.

An investigation of the relationship between age, sex and
strategy preference on a measure of cognitive mapping was
completed using a 2 (young v. old) by 2 (male v. female) by
2 (strategy preference) repeated measures ANOVA with
Map type as the repeated measure and placement error as
the dependent variable. There was a main effect of Map
Type, F(2, 76) = 21.01, p < .001. A LSD post-hoc test was
conducted to determine the characteristics of this difference.
Placement error on the Geometry Only Map (M = 17.31,
SD = 9.31) was significantly greater than either the Objects
Only Map (M = 10.43, SD = 8.26) or the Objects and
Geometry Map (M = 10.85, SD = 9.13). There was no
difference between objects only and objects and geometry
maps.
There was also a main effect of Strategy Preference on
Placement Error, F(1, 76) = 12.78, p = .001 (Figure 6).
Participants who preferred an allocentric strategy (M = 9.80,
SD = 5.21) were more accurate at placing the platform than
participants who preferred an egocentric strategy (M =
14.68, SD = 6.30). There was no effect for age group,
F(1,76) = .18, p = .67, or sex, F(1,76) = 1.19, p = .28.

The present study found age—but not sex--group

differences in navigation strategy using a virtual strategy
assessment. Age differences were pronounced: only 18%
older adults preferred an allocentric strategy during the
vYSA, while younger adults were much more evenly
distributed. This was conceptually similar to the results of
the Barnes task, in which older rats were more likely than
young to prefer an egocentric strategy.
Consistent with prior research, (Newman and Kaszniak
2000; Moffat and Resnick 2002; Driscoll et al. 2005), older
adult average latency during learning trials of the vMWT
was greater than in younger adults.
An important component of this study was the
demonstration of a relationship between strategy preference
on the vYSA and subsequent performance on the vMWT.
We found that allocentric preference on the vYSA was
associated with better performance on the vMWT probe trial
and cognitive mapping. Allocentric vYSA preference was
associated with improved vMWT learning trial performance
in the young but not the older participants. Cumulatively,
these results suggest that the vYSA is measuring an
important preference for a spatial navigation strategy that
may affect performance on subsequent independent
navigation tasks.
The lack of relationship between navigation strategy and
performance among older adults in the vMWT learning
trials may be due to a number of factors. One possibility is
that there were not enough older adults that preferred an
allocentric strategy to detect a relationship between older
adult strategy preference and navigation performance.
Another might be related to the nature of the vMWT. The
vMWT can be solved most quickly using an allocentric
strategy, but older adults may no longer be capable of using
an allocentric strategy effectively. This would explain the
strong preference among older adults for the presumably
less complex egocentric strategy. If this explanation is
correct, even if an older adult preferred an allocentric
strategy in the very easy vYSA, this preference may not
have helped them in the much more difficult vMWT.
No relationship was found between sex and navigation
strategy, which is inconsistent with other studies on the
topic (Levy et al. 2005; Schmitzer-Torbert 2007). The
vYSA is intentionally a very easy task for participants to
complete. It is possible that there may be a ceiling effect
among young adults that obscures a possible relationship
between sex and strategy that would be found in a more
difficult maze such as Schmitzer-Torbert‟s.
Another
possibility is that preference for one strategy over another in
young adults might not reflect functional limitations, as
might be the case with older adults. Further research is
needed to determine what, if any, impact sex might have on
navigation strategy and how this might be mediated at the
neuroanatomical level. Environmental characteristics and
task demands may also be important factors that warrant
further investigation.

One weakness of the present study was the lack of an
egocentric task to accompany the allocentric-focused
vMWT. An example of such a task would be branching
maze task, in which there is only one correct path through a
maze with multiple intersections. It is conceivable that
participants who prefer an egocentric strategy may show
benefits on a subsequent egocentric task such as this.
Another weakness of this study is that because
participants self-selected their strategy, cell sizes were not
equal. In particular, only four older adults preferred an
allocentric strategy, and three of those were male. Future
studies can address this by testing greater numbers of older
adults and selecting an equal number of each age, strategy,
and sex combination.
In summary, the present study demonstrated age but not
sex differences in strategy preference. As well, the present
study demonstrated that strategy preference is related to
subsequent performance on other navigation tasks,
suggesting that our vYSA strategy assessment may be
measuring relatively stable and generalized strategy
dispositions.
