Materials and Procedure
Presentation of art and moral tasks was counterbalanced
across participants.
Art: Stimuli consisted of four non-representational abstract1
images created by professional artists whose work we
selected from art history textbooks (e.g. Hans Hoffman,
Helen Frankenthaler). Images were presented one by one on
a laptop; images were equated in size and resolution, to the
extent that it was possible to do without distortion. Images
were given black borders with no frame visible; signatures of
the professional artists were removed using Adobe
Photoshop.
          A brief narrative accompanied each image,
presented directly above it, indicating how the image was
created and by whom. Narratives were constructed to
manipulate the process by which the image was created:
accidentally or intentionally. Word count was matched across
conditions. Images were seen as accidental or intentional an             Figure 2. Sample Moral Scenarios. Positive moral stories on
