Figure 2: Categorization of stimuli aggregated across participants. Part a) and b) show the responses during the third block of
learning (the block before the transfer items were introduced). Part c) and d) show the categorization of transfer items (lengths
410 through 490) during the last two blocks of training, which were intermixed with the training items (colored histograms).
Part a) and c) show semi-supervised participants, and b) and d) show supervised participants. The plots shows the probability
of responding “N” for each stimulus during these blocks, aggregated across participants. Participants in the left shift and right
shift groups showed different categorization profiles. For the semi-supervised condition, these two groups only differed in the
no-feedback stimuli they saw. This indicates that no-feedback stimuli influenced the learned category representations. The
dotted curves shows 10 posterior samples of psychometric functions, see “Bayesian estimate of unlabeled influence.”
