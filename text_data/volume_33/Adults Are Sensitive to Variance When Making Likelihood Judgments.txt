though in Narrow conditions sample percentages were, on
average, equidistant from the more central and the more
extreme population µs, in Wide conditions sample
percentages were, on average, closer to the more central
population µ. Thus, if the participants were being more
strongly influenced by these mean differences than by
variance, they would tend to give more central answers in
the Wide & Central than the Narrow & Extreme conditions.
Indeed, this effect was observed (F(1,220) = 79.8, p < .0005 η2p

= 132.9, p < .0005, η2p = .38). Further, the effect of Narrow
& Extreme vs. Wide & Central populations was stronger in
the High Parity conditions (F(1,220) = 10.0, p < .005, η2p =
.04). These findings are in line with previous research
(Obrecht et al., 2007; Obrecht, under review) indicating that
differences in means have a stronger influence on people’s
decisions than differences in variance.
