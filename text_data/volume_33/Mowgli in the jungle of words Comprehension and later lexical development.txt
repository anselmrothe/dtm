object pairings, in a production task they may have greater
trouble retrieving a particular word from memory. In such
instances, they may resort to use of a more easily retrieved
but less appropriate word. Also, they may sometimes
successfully retrieve a word from memory in connection
with an object to which it is strongly linked but fail to
retrieve it in connection with an object to which it is more
weakly linked. These retrieval failures could produce a
pattern of overextension of some words and underextension
of others, even if the child has a more adult-like pattern of
knowledge encoded in memory. Second, it has long been
noted that children’s appropriate responses to words (such
as picking up an object named by an adult) often precede
their production in development (e.g., Benedict, 1979;
Kuczaj, 1982; Rescorla, 1981). Children may have good
implicit knowledge of the adult pattern but be unable to
fully deploy that knowledge in production.                                  Figure 1: Typical examples of fles (upper left), pot

were used more broadly by the youngest children than by
adults and their use narrowed over time, while bus was
initially used more narrowly and broadened over time. In
contrast, here we found that across ages, the names were
gradually applied to smaller groups of objects. This trend
toward narrowing over time is significant for all names, as
indicated by the linear trend tests reported above. Thus,
these data contrast with the production data in showing only
narrowing of use over time.
   Since the preceding analysis showed that the children’s
lexical categories were uniformly larger than adults’, we can
deduce that overall, there must be more overlap, or, less
differentiation, among the categories for children than for
adults. To quantify the overlap, we calculated the mean               Figure 2: Two-dimensional MDS representation of the 73

names that each object is assigned to significantly decreased
over age (F(1,7295) = -24.29, p <.0001).
   To visualize the changes in overlap, we projected the
lexical categories of the youngest children and adults onto a
geometrical representation of the stimuli, which was also
used in Ameel, Malt, Storms, and Van Assche (2009). The
multidimensional scaling (MDS) representation was based
on non-linguistic similarity judgments derived from adult
sorting data collected by Ameel et al. (2005). Even though
children’s sorting data were available (Ameel et al., 2008),
we decided to use the MDS solution based on adult sorting
data to project categories onto because the adult data were
more reliable than the child data. In such a geometrical
representation, each exemplar of a category is represented
by a vector of M coordinates, one for each of the M                   Figure 3: Two-dimensional MDS representation of the 73

judged how good an example the objects were for one of the
three names fles, bus and pot. The order of the names was
randomized across participants.
  To judge typicality, the participants used a 7-point rating
scale, which was accompanied by three schematic faces,
each having a different expression: the “frowning” face,
located below number 1, corresponded to “very poor”
examples of the target category, the “smiling” face, located
below number 7, corresponded to “very good” examples of
the target category, and the “straight” face, located below
number 4, corresponded to “okay” examples of the category
name. The schematic faces were similar to the ones used in
a study of Bjorklund, Thompson, and Ornstein (1983) who
