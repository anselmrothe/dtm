Abstract: Die Identification of cognitive deficits may contribute to the therapy success. The present study compares
cognitive function of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) before and after multidisciplinary pain therapy
(MDTP). 32 patients with cLBP and 25 healthy controls were assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological
Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). The Trail Making Test (TMT), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and
multiple choice vocabulary test (MWT-B) were used to evaluate the intelligence quotient (IQ) in parallel. Before
MDTP, patients needed significantly longer time in TMTâ€“A and TMT-B, in comparison to HC. Three weeks and 6
months after MDTP, the reaction time in TMT-A and MWT-B results of patients was significantly improved after
MDTP. These findings provide new insights into impairment in information processing and executive function in
people with cLBP and dysfunction of working memory. The MDTP showed clearly long-term effect on cognitive
impact of patients with cLBP.
