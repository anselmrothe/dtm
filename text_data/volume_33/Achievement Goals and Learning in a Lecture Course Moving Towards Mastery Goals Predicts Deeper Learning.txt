Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between achievement goals and the type of knowledge acquired during a University lecture course in Cognitive Psychology. Studentsâ€™ achievement goals (mastery-approach,
performance-approach, and performance-avoidance) were measured right before each of the 3 exams administered
during the course. Each exam included items that assessed factual, conceptual, and application-based knowledge.
Exam 1 performance on factual and conceptual items was (marginally) positively predicted by performance-approach
goals but not mastery-approach goals. However, by Exam 3 mastery-approach goals positively predicted performance
whereas performance-approach goals did not. Furthermore, changes in these goals from Exam 1 to Exam 3 predicted
performance. Becoming more mastery-oriented over time predicted higher Exam 3 scores, while becoming more
performance-approach-oriented predicted lower scores. This difference was particularly strong for application questions, which required a deeper understanding of the material. Results are discussed in terms of a theory describing
the effect of goals on learning processes and performance.
