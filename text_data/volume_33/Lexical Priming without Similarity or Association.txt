Abstract: Integrative relations, which combine two independent concepts (e.g., ”lake” and ”bird”) into a compound representation (”lake bird”), induce lexical priming. For example, ”lake” speeds lexical decisions to ”bird”
even though they are semantically dissimilar, lexically unassociated, and unfamiliar as a phrase. We report three
experiments that investigate whether this integrative priming occurs prospectively (i.e., the prime pre-activates
the target) or retrospectively (i.e., prime and target are integrated post-presentation). Integrative (e.g., ”lake” ->
”bird”), associative (e.g., ”canary” -> ”bird”), and unrelated word pairs (e.g., ”trial” -> ”bird”) were presented in
the perceptual identification, reading aloud, and Stroop color naming tasks, which are thought to measure prospective
processing. Integrative pairs and associative pairs both elicited robust priming. That is, prime words (e.g., ”lake”)
facilitated recognition of dissimilar, unassociated target words (e.g., ”bird”). Although similarity and association
may explain other lexical and sentential priming effects, our results suggest instead a prospective integration process.
