   The NSL signers’ performance reveals that finger
representations can be summary symbols of the numbers
they represent, and therefore can be placeholders for exact
number concepts during development. However, when
gestures for number are not learned in a rote list during
language development, finger gestures represent individuals
in the set, not whole sets. Because of this, homesigners’
gestures may be used as placeholders, as they are not
symbols that mean “seven,” but rather symbols that mean
“one one one one one one one.”
