Abstract: Some people automatically and involuntarily ”see” mental images of numbers in spatial arrays when they
think of numbers. This phenomenon, called number forms, shares three key characteristics with the other types of
synaesthesiae, within-individual consistency, between-individual variety, and mixture of regularity and randomness.
An experiment was conducted to investigate whether mental number lines of non-synaesthetes share the properties
above.
