Abstract: The attractor neural networks, originally developed by Hinton & Shallice (1991), can be applicable to
variety of neuropsychological data. It can account for delays of reaction times of the brain damaged patients. When
the network suffers damages, the iteration numbers between the output and the cleanup layers would increase. In
addition, it can also account for performances of the categorization tasks of category specific disorders, and for
reading performances of dyslectic patients. We applied the attractor network to the data of Tyler et.al.(2000) for
categorization task, and the data of Plaut & Schallice(1993) for word reading. In spite of variety of data, the attractor
network showed good performances. When the network was damaged partially, the increases of the iteration numbers
could be interpreted as the delays of reaction times. The triangle model for word reading was attempted to mimic
human data by this attractor neural network model.
