Abstract: The adoption of new technology depends on various factors, such as the type of technology, the context
or culture in which the technology is introduced, and the individual decisions by people within that culture. This
work presents an approach that uses an agent-based model to encompass the detailed behavior of individuals and
their immediate network of relationships, as well as an influence-based system dynamics model to show how societylevel influences function interactively and with respect to individual agents. The exploration of technology adoption
grounds the model in a realistic environment and allows the incorporation of theoretical models from multiple relevant
domains. The integrated model demonstrates how representing behavior at multiple scales is a natural approach
that allows for a greater understanding of how influences across different scales interact and affect the adoption of a
new technology.
