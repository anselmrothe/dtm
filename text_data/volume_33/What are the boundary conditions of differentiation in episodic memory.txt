   One might be inclined to think that the context shifts that
occurred between repetitions of items weren’t dramatic
enough to break the boundaries of differentiation. However,
the decrease in FAR that differentiation models predict as
the proportion of strong items increases was not found,
t(97.27) = 0.14. Thus, these results present a challenge for
differentiation models.
   While the results of the data analysis suggest a null list-
strength effect, there was a trend in the direction of a list-
strength effect, as hit rates for weak items were worse in the
mostly strong condition than in the mostly weak condition,
t(90.47) = 2.22, p < .05, although hit rates for strong items
were not significantly worse in the mostly strong condition,
t(94.47) = 1.43, p > .05. One possible reason why this might
be is because the lengths of the lists in the mostly strong
condition (156 presentations per list, which is almost eight
minutes) are unusually long for recognition experiments.
Many participants seemed very frustrated with the length
and tedium of the task, which may have caused fatigue.             Figure 2: Performance from the end-of-session test of
