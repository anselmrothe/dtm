Abstract

syntactic antecedent of one = “red bottle”
semantic referent of one = RED BOTTLE

A controversial claim in linguistics is that children face an induction problem, which is often used to motivate the need for
Universal Grammar. English anaphoric one has been argued
to present this kind of induction problem. While the original
solution was that children have innate domain-specific knowledge about the structure of language, more recent studies have
suggested alternative solutions involving domain-specific input restrictions coupled with domain-general learning abilities.
We consider whether indirect evidence coming from a broader
input set could obviate the need for such input restrictions. We
present an online Bayesian learner that uses this broader input
set, and discover it can indeed reproduce the correct learning
behavior for anaphoric one, given child-directed speech. We
discuss what is required for acquisition success, and how this
impacts the larger debate about Universal Grammar.

The original proposal for learning anaphoric one required
children to have innate domain-specific knowledge about the
structure of language, as part of the child’s Universal Grammar (Baker, 1978). However, more recent studies have suggested alternative solutions involving innate domain-general
learning abilities coupled with input restrictions that arise
from domain-specific learning constraints (Foraker et al.,
2009; Pearl & Lidz, 2009; Regier & Gahl, 2004).
Here, we consider whether indirect evidence leveraged
from a broader input set could lead children to the correct
knowledge for anaphoric one. If so, we can then refine the
current views on what is required for successful acquisition and specifically, whether it is (i) domain-specific or domaingeneral, and (ii) innate or derivable.
We first discuss adult and child knowledge of anaphoric
one, and then review previous proposals for how to learn this
from the available input. We then motivate why a child might
view a broader input set as informative for anaphoric one.
Following this, we present an online Bayesian learner that
uses this broader data set, and find that our learner is indeed
capable of reproducing the behavior associated with correct
knowledge of anaphoric one without imposing any domainspecific input restrictions. We conclude with discussion of
what is required for acquisition success, and how this impacts
the larger debate about Universal Grammar.

Induction problems in language acquisition
One of the most controversial claims in developmental and
theoretical linguistics is that children learning their native language face an induction problem, sometimes called “Poverty
of the Stimulus” (Chomsky, 1980; Crain, 1991). Simply put,
this is the claim that the data in children’s input are insufficient to identify the correct language knowledge as quickly
as children seem to.
If this is true, then children must bring something to the
language acquisition problem - and the nature of this “something” is often debated. Is it domain-specific or domaingeneral? Is it something derivable from prior experience or
something necessarily innate? These questions are important, as induction problems in language acquisition are often used to motivate innate, domain-specific knowledge about
language (Universal Grammar (Chomsky, 1965)).
The potential induction problem presented by English
anaphoric one (1) has received considerable recent attention
(e.g., Foraker, Regier, Khetarpal, Perfors, and Tenenbaum
(2009); Lidz, Waxman, and Freedman (2003); Pearl and Lidz
(2009); Regier and Gahl (2004)).

English anaphoric one
Adult knowledge
The adult representation of English anaphoric one has both
a syntactic and semantic component. In order to interpret an
utterance like (1), the listener must first identify the syntactic
antecedent of one, i.e., what string one is replacing. In (1),
adults interpret one’s antecedent as “red bottle”, so the utterance is equivalent to “Look - a red bottle! Oh, look - another
red bottle!”
Then, the listener uses this syntactic antecedent to identify
the semantic referent of one, e.g., what object in the world
one is referring to. Given the syntactic antecedent “red bottle”, adults interpret the referent of one as a bottle that is red
(RED BOTTLE), as opposed to just any bottle (BOTTLE). Ac-

(1) Anaphoric one
Situation: Two red bottles are present.
Utterance: “Look - a red bottle! Oh, look - another one!”
Interpretation of one:

cording to standard linguistic practice, the string “red bottle”
has the structure in (2), while “a red bottle” has the structure
in (3):

that there is also ambiguity with respect to the semantic referent (e.g., RED BOTTLE vs. any BOTTLE). Examples (6) and
(7) demonstrate two kinds of ambiguous data.
(6) Syntactic (Syn) Ambiguity
Situation: There are two bottles present.
Utterance: “Look, a bottle! Oh look - another one!”

(2)
[N 0 red [N 0 [N 0 bottle]]
(3) [NP a [N 0 red [N 0 [N 0 bottle]]]
The syntactic category N0 can only contain nouns (e.g.,
“bottle”), and the category NP contains any noun phrase (e.g.,
“a red bottle”). The syntactic category N’ is larger than N0 but
smaller than NP, and can contain both nouns (e.g., “bottle”)
and noun+modifier strings (e.g. “red bottle”). Note that the
string “bottle” can be labeled both as syntactic category N’
(4a) and syntactic category N0 (4b).1

(7) Semantic and Syntactic (Sem-Syn) Ambiguity
Situation: There are two red bottles present.
Utterance: “Look, a red bottle! Oh look - another one!”
Syn ambiguous data do not clearly indicate the category of
one, even though the semantic referent is clear. In (6), the

semantic referent must be BOTTLE since the antecedent can
only be “bottle”. But, is the syntactic structure [N 0 [N 0 bottle]]
or just [N 0 bottle]? Notably, if the child held the mistaken
hypothesis that one was category N0 , this data point would
not conflict with that hypothesis since it is compatible with
the structure being [N 0 bottle].
Sem-Syn ambiguous data are unclear about both the referent and the category of one. In (7), if the child held the
mistaken hypothesis that the referent is simply BOTTLE (unlike the adult interpretation of RED BOTTLE), this would not
be disproven by this data point - there is in fact another bottle present. This data point is ambiguous syntactically for the
same reason Syn data like (6) are: if the referent is BOTTLE,
then the antecedent is “bottle”, which is either N0 or N’.
Fortunately, there are some unambiguous data available
like (8), but these require a very specific conjunction of situation and utterance.

(4a) [N 0 [N 0 bottle]]
(4b)
[N 0 bottle]
Linguistic theory posits that anaphoric elements only have
antecedents of the same syntactic category. Since one’s antecedent can be “red bottle”, then one should be category N’
in these cases. Notably, if the syntactic category of one were
instead N0 , one could not have “red bottle” as its antecedent;
instead, it could only have noun-only strings like “bottle”, and
we could not get the interpretation that we do for (1).
One way to represent adult knowledge is (5):
(5) Adult anaphoric one knowledge in utterances like
“Look - a red bottle! Do you see another one?”
(a) Syntactic structure: category N’
(b) Semantic referent: The mentioned property (“red”) is
relevant for determining the referent of one.

(8) Unambiguous (Unamb) data
Situation: Both a red bottle and a purple bottle are present.
Utterance: “Look - a red bottle! There doesn’t seem to be
another one here, though.”

Child knowledge
Behavioral evidence from Lidz et al. (2003) (henceforth
LWF) suggests that young children also have this same interpretation for utterances like (1). LWF examined the looking behavior of 18-month-olds when hearing an utterance like
“Look, a red bottle! Do you see another one?”. The 18month-olds demonstrated a significant preference for looking
at the bottle that was red (as compared to a bottle that was
some other color). LWF interpreted this to mean that by 18
months, children have acquired the same representation for
anaphoric one that adults have.

In (8), if the child mistakenly believes the referent is just
then the antecedent of one is “bottle” and it’s surprising that the speaker would claim there’s not “another bottle here”, since another bottle is clearly present. Thus, this
data point unambiguously indicates that the property “red” is
important, so the semantic referent is RED BOTTLE. The corresponding syntactic antecedent is “red bottle”, which has the
syntactic structure [N 0 red [N 0 [N 0 bottle]]] and indicates one’s
category is N’.
Unfortunately, unambiguous data comprise only a small
fraction of children’s input - LWF discovered that a mere
0.25% of child-directed anaphoric one utterances were unambiguous data. For this reason, the debate has arisen about
how children might solve this acquisition problem as rapidly
as they do.
BOTTLE ,

Learning anaphoric one
The learning problem
Learning the correct representation for anaphoric one is difficult because many anaphoric one data are ambiguous with respect to what syntactic category one is, even if children know
that the choice is between N’ and N0 . Moreover, as we saw
in (2), sometimes there is more than one N’ antecedent to
choose from (e.g., “red bottle” vs. “bottle”), which means

Innate, domain-specific knowledge
An early proposal (Baker, 1978) (henceforth Baker) assumed
that only unambiguous data were informative. Given the
sparsity of these data, it was proposed that children possess
domain-specific knowledge about the structure of language -

1 We

note that the actual labels themselves are immaterial. It is
only relevant that these structural levels are distinguished in this way,
i.e., that “red bottle” and “bottle” are the same label (N’ here), while
“bottle” can also be labeled with a smaller category label (N0 here).

880

in particular, children innately know that anaphoric elements
(like one) cannot be syntactic category N0 . Instead, children
automatically rule out that possibility from their hypothesis
space, and simply know that one is category N’.

(9) “Look at the cute penguin. I want to hug it/him/her.”
≈ “Look at the cute penguin. I want to hug the cute penguin.”

Here, the antecedent of the pronoun it/him/her is the NP
“the cute penguin”:

Domain-general learning abilities +
domain-specific input restrictions

(10) [NP the [N 0 cute [N 0 [N 0 penguin]]]]
In fact, it turns out that one can also have an NP antecedent:

Regier and Gahl (2004) (henceforth R&G) noted that SemSyn data like (7) could be leveraged to learn the correct representation for anaphoric one. Specifically, a learner with
domain-general statistical learning abilities could track how
often a property that was mentioned was important for the
referent to have (e.g., when “red” was mentioned, was the
referent just a BOTTLE or specifically a RED BOTTLE?). If
the referent had that property (e.g., was a RED BOTTLE), this
meant that the syntactic antecedent of one would be an N’
string (e.g., “red bottle”) and implicated one’s category as N’.
The R&G data set consisted of both unambiguous data and
Sem-Syn ambiguous data, and their online Bayesian learner
was able to learn the correct interpretation for anaphoric one.
No innate, domain-specific knowledge was required.
Pearl and Lidz (2009) (henceforth P&L) noted that if the
child had to learn the syntactic category of one, an equalopportunity (EO) learner would view Syn ambiguous data
like (6) as informative. Unfortunately, Syn ambiguous data
far outnumber the Sem-Syn ambiguous and unambiguous
data combined (about 20 to 1 in their corpus analysis), and
in fact lead a probabilistic learner of the kind R&G propose
to the wrong syntactic category for one (i.e., one=N0 ). Thus,
R&G’s Bayesian learner would have to explicitly filter out the
Syn ambiguous data. P&L suggested that this kind of filter
is domain-specific, since it involves ignoring a specific kind
of linguistic data, though they speculate how this restriction
could be derived from domain-general learning preferences.
Foraker et al. (2009) (henceforth F&al) focused on identifying the syntactic category of one, applying an ideal
Bayesian learner to the syntactic input alone. Their learner
employed subtle conceptual knowledge to identify the likely
syntactic category for one (specifically, a syntactic complement is “conceptually evoked by its head noun” and indicates
the noun string is N0 , while a modifier is not and indicates
the noun string is N’). While there were not many informative one data points in their data, their ideal learner was able
to learn that one was category N’. Their learner required a
domain-specific input restriction to syntactic data as well as
domain-specific knowledge about the subtle distinction between complements and modifiers, and their implications for
syntactic categories.

(11) “Look! A red bottle. I want one.”
≈ “Look! A red bottle. I want a red bottle.”

So, the issue of one’s syntactic category only occurs when
one is being used in a syntactic environment that indicates it
is smaller than NP (examples of this <NP environment are in
(1), (6), (7), and (8)). Notably, one shares some semantic and
syntactic distribution properties with other pronouns.
Following R&G’s idea, a learner could track how often a
property mentioned in the potential antecedent (e.g., “red” in
“a red bottle” in (11)) is important for the referent to have.
Crucially, we can apply this not only to data points where
one is <NP ((6) and (8)), but also to data points where pronouns are used anaphorically and in an NP syntactic environment ((9) and (11)). When the potential antecedent mentions
a property and the pronoun is used as an NP, the antecedent
is necessarily also an NP, and necessarily includes the mentioned property (e.g., “a red bottle”). Data points like (9) and
(11) are thus unambiguous both syntactically (category=NP)
and semantically (the referent must have the mentioned property). We will refer to them as unambiguous NP (Unamb
NP) data points, and these are the additional data points our
learner (henceforth the P&M learner) will learn from.
Like the R&G and P&L learners, our learner differs from
the Baker learner by learning from data besides the unambiguous <NP data. However, our learner differs from the
learners in R&G and P&L by learning from data containing
anaphoric elements besides one.2 Table 1 shows which learners use which data.

Information in the data

A broader view of informative data

Figure 1 represents the information dependencies in any data
point where a pronoun is used anaphorically and there is a
potential antecedent that has been mentioned recently.

Instead of restricting the input set, we consider expanding it
beyond unambiguous (8), Sem-Syn ambiguous (7), and Syn
ambiguous (6) data. Consider that there are other anaphoric
elements in the language besides one, such as pronouns like
it, him, her, etc. These pronouns are category NP, since they
replace an entire noun phrase (NP) when they are used (9):

2 Our learner also differs from the F&al learner by leveraging
both syntactic and semantic information, instead of just syntactic
information.

Important quantities
The two components of the correct representation for
anaphoric one are (a) that a property mentioned in the potential antecedent is important for the referent of one to have,
and (b) that one is category N’ when it is not an NP. These
correspond to “property important?” and “syntactic category
of pronoun” in Figure 1. We represent the probability of the
former as pI and the probability of the latter as pN 0 .
We follow the update methods in P&L, and use equation
(12) adapted from Chew (1971), which assumes p comes
from a binomial distribution and the beta distribution is used
to estimate the prior:

Under S YNTACTIC U SAGE, we can observe which pronoun is used (e.g., it, one, etc.). The syntactic category depends on which pronoun is used (e.g., NP, N’, or N0 for
one). We can observe the syntactic environment in which
the pronoun is used, which depends on the syntactic category (e.g., “another one” indicates a syntactic environment
of <NP, which means the category is N’ or N0 ). The syntactic category also determines whether the antecedent string
can contain a modifier (e.g., category N0 cannot, since it only
allows bare nouns like “bottle”).
Under R EFERENTIAL I NTENT, we can observe whether
the potential antecedent mentioned a property or not (e.g., “a
red bottle” vs. “a bottle”). If a property was mentioned, it is a
latent variable whether the mentioned property was important
for the referent of the pronoun to have. This then determines
whether the antecedent string must include that property (e.g.,
it must if the property is important).
Both the antecedent string variables determine the content of the actual antecedent string (e.g., if both a modifier
and a property must be included, the antecedent would be
“red bottle” rather than simply “bottle”). Finally, the antecedent string determines what object is being referred to,
and whether that object has the mentioned property (e.g.,
whether it’s a RED BOTTLE when the previous context was
“a red bottle”). This is observable (e.g., we can see if the
bottle that one refers to is in fact red).
These variables can take on the following values:

px =

α + datax
,α = β = 1
α + β + totaldatax

(12)

α and β represent a very weak prior when set to 1. datax
represents how many informative data points indicative of
x have been observed, while totaldatax represents the total
number of potential x data points observed. After every informative data point, datax and totaldatax are updated as in
(13), and then px is updated using equation (12). The variable φx indicates the probability that the current data point is
an example of an x data point. For unambiguous data, φx = 1;
for ambiguous data φX < 1.

property important? ∈ {Yes, No}

pI is updated for Unambiguous <NP data, Sem-Syn Ambiguous data, and Unambiguous NP data. pN 0 is updated for
Unambiguous <NP data, Sem-Syn Ambiguous data, and Syn
Ambiguous data.
The value of φx depends on data type. We can derive the
value of φI by using the information dependencies in Figure
1, and the basic Bayes equation. φI uses equation (14), which
includes π (what pronoun was mentioned), σ (what the syntactic environment is), µ (whether the previous context mentioned a property), ω (whether the object has the mentioned
property), and I (the property is important):

Unambiguous <NP and Unambiguous NP data have φI =1,

Measures of success
In addition to measuring pI and pN 0 at the end of the learning period, a good metric of acquisition success is how likely
the learner is to produce the infant looking behavior in the
LWF experiment (e.g., “Look - a red bottle! Do you see another one?”). Specifically, we can calculate the probability
(pbeh ) of the learner looking at the referent that has the mentioned property (e.g., the RED referent given that “red” was
mentioned) when given a choice between two referents.
pbeh = p(ω = hasproperty|π = one, σ =< NP, µ = yes)

(18)

(21)

This works out to

where ρ1 , ρ2 , and ρ3 are the same as in (16). Equation (18)
is intuitively satisfying as only ρ1 and ρ2 are representations
with syntactic category N’.
Syn Ambiguous data have φN 0 as the following:

ρ4 + ρ5

(20b)

For the free parameters in the model, we will follow the
corpus-based estimate P&L used for m and n: m = 1 and n =
3. We will also follow an estimate P&L used for t: t = 5.

Table 3: Input sets for different anaphoric one proposals

Unambiguous <NP data have φI =1, which is again intuitively satisfying since they unambiguously indicate that the
category is N’ when the syntactic environment is <NP. SemSyn ambiguous data have φN 0 as in (18):
φN 0 Sem−Syn =

ρ5 =

To gauge the frequency of the different data types in childdirected input, we conducted a corpus analysis of 17,521
child-directed utterances in the Brown-Eve corpus from
CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000). Following P&L, we posit
that the anaphoric one learning period begins at 14 months
and that children hear approximately 1,000,000 sentences
from birth until 18 months. We can then use the data frequencies in the Brown-Eve corpus to estimate the expected
distribution of pronoun data between 14 and 18 months. Table 3 shows the input sets used to test the different learning
proposals for anaphoric one.

In (16), m and n refer to how often N’ strings are observed
to contain modifiers (m) (e.g., “red bottle), as opposed to
containing only nouns (n) (e.g., “bottle”). These help determine the probability of observing an N’ string with a modifier (16a), as compared to an N’ string without one (16b).
Parameter t indicates how many property types there are in
the learner’s hypothesis space, which determines how suspicious a coincidence it is that the object just happens to have
the mentioned property.
The quantities in (16) correlate with anaphoric one representations. For ρ1 , the syntactic category is N’ (pN 0 ), a modm
ifier is used ( n+m
), and the property is important (pI ). For
ρ2 , the syntactic category is N’ (pN 0 ), a modifier is not used
n
( n+m
), the property is not important (1- pI ), and the object
has the mentioned property by chance ( 1t ). For ρ3 , the syntactic category is N0 (1-pN 0 ), the property is not important (1pI ), and the object has the mentioned property by chance ( 1t ).
The value of φN 0 also depends on data type. We derive the
value of φN 0 similarly (though not identically) to φI :
φN 0 = p(N 0 |π, σ =< NP, µ, ω) =

where ρ1 , ρ2 , and ρ3 are defined as in (16), m = 1, n = 3,
and t = 2. As before, these quantities intuitively correspond
to the different outcomes. The numerator represents all the

outcomes where the learner looks to the correct object (ρ1 , ρ2
and ρ3 looking at the RED bottle), while the denominator includes the two additional outcomes where the learner looks to
the incorrect object (ρ2 and ρ3 looking at the non-RED bottle).

This is domain-specific knowledge, though it could be derived through innate domain-general statistical learning abilities applied to the input. The child can then track how often a mentioned property is important for a referent to have
by using these same domain-general abilities. In the second
learning stage, the learner uses these domain-general abilities
coupled with domain-specific knowledge that allows complements and modifiers to be distinguished in the syntactic input
(F&al). This domain-specific knowledge could be innate (as
part of Universal Grammar), or perhaps derived somehow.
To conclude, we find that indirect evidence can be leveraged effectively by an online probabilistic learner in order
to produce behavior consistent with infant anaphoric one behavior, even if the learner does not achieve the adult representation. Though this learning step does not require innate domain-specific knowledge, a second step that allows
the learner to achieve the adult representation might. We believe this general approach of looking at broader input sets for
learning linguistic phenomena may be fruitful for identifying
what is and is not necessarily part of Universal Grammar.

Interestingly, while the P&M learner has a lower probability for one as N’ in general (pN 0 = .37), it has an extremely
high probability of reproducing infant behavior and interpreting one correctly in the LWF scenario (pbeh > .99). This is
because the learner believes the mentioned property is important (pI > .99). If the property is important, the antecedent
must contain the modifier (e.g., be “red bottle” as opposed to
“bottle”) - which means the learner will choose the correct
referent even if the learner generally thinks one is N0 . That
is, infants could produce adult-like behavior in this context
without having adult-like representations of anaphoric one.
We note that this result is due to the input set the P&M
learner is using - the learners using restricted input sets behave exactly as previous studies found. Learning from unambiguous data alone does not work (Baker), though including
Sem-Syn ambiguous data will lead to the correct representation and the correct behavior (R&G, P&L). Additionally including Syn ambiguous data (P&L’s EO) leads to the incorrect representation and chance looking behavior. Expanding
to unambiguous NP data (P&M) doesn’t solve the incorrect
category problem for one, but it turns out this isn’t always
necessary to interpret one correctly in context.
This suggests that while children must eventually learn that
one is N’, they do not need to do so by 18 months. This
may allow them time to develop the ability to make the subtle conceptual distinctions F&al’s learner uses to leverage the
syntactic distribution of one and converge on one as N’. This
leads to a more complex acquisition trajectory. Initially, children could use a broader input set (like the P&M learner) and
learn the correct interpretation for one in most contexts, even
if they believe one is usually N0 . Later, children could be
sophisticated enough to leverage the information in the syntactic distribution and identify one as definitively N’.
The knowledge needed for acquisition success would then
include both domain-specific and domain-general components. To identify the broader data set the P&M learner used,
the child needs to recognize that one is similar to other pronouns (i.e., it is anaphoric and has syntactic antecedents).
