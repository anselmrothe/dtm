Abstract: Students were presented with a module on circuits in text and diagram format only (control-text condi-
tion), text and diagram with an animation of the voltage and currents in parts of series and parallel circuits (partial
external visual representation condition), or they were given the an animation of the voltage and current throughout
the entire circuit (full external visual representation condition). Students in the full external visual representation
conditions performed significantly better than the control-text and partial external visual representation conditions
on questions of free recall but significantly higher on multiple choice and drawing questions than the control-text
group only. This evidence suggests providing complete visual external representations is most beneficial to students
for reconstructing and manipulating a mental model of the abstract system without being given any hints or clues
from external sources like question stems but also more beneficial than traditional textbook methods for answering
standard multiple choice questions.
