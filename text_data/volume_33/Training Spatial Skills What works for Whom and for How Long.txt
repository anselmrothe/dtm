Abstract: Strong spatial skills predict achievement in STEM fields (e.g., Shea, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2001; Wai,
Lubinski, & Benbow, 2009). Improving spatial skills is therefore of both theoretical and practical importance. To
determine whether and to what extent training can improve these skills, we meta-analyzed 217 research studies,
investigating the magnitude, moderators, durability and generalizability of training on spatial skills. The average
effect size (Hedgesâ€™ g) for training relative to control was .47 (SE = .04). Effect sizes were affected substantially by
the presence of control groups. When treatment and control group improvements were considered separately, the
mean effect size for trained groups was .62 (SE = .04), while the effect size for control groups was only .45 (SE =
.04). Training effects were durable, and led to near and medium transfer. Considered together, the results suggest
that spatially enriched education could pay substantial dividends in increasing participation in STEM disciplines.
