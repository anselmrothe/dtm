 have been made that this approach applies to many aspects of
word learning (Xu, Dewar, & Perfors, 2009).
    To further understand how biases shape learning, Havasi
 and Snedeker (Havasi & Snedeker, 2004) began to explore the
 lexicalization bias for motion verbs. The experiments focused
 on the plasticity of the English manner motion verb bias and
 its dependence on syntactic frame. As noted by Talmy, the
 relative rarity of path verbs in English leads most English
 speakers to think of these verbs as secondary (Talmy, 1985).
 Like most linguistic biases, we are clearly not born with such
 a bias. Through their experiments, they sought to discover if
 the manner bias could be reversed to a path bias, and if so, to
 explore the possibility that these biases are influenced by the      Figure 1: A screenshot from the original Havasi-Snedeker

 to a bias which was surprisingly plastic and adaptable with
 training, even in adult subjects.
    Prior models of verb learning were Bayesian in nature, but
 encountered effects which could not be explained with a single-
 level model. Some of these effects can be accounted for by a
 two level model: children are learning verbs and the behavior
 of verbs in the language simultaneously. From here on, we
will refer to knowledge about the meanings of particular verbs
 as “level-1 knowledge”, and knowledge about verbs in the
 language as a whole as “level-2 knowledge”.
    In this paper, we design and test a hierarchical model for
which matches the pattern of performance in the Havasi and
 Snedeker verb learning studies, with a particular focus on
 modeling level-2 knowledge. We are interested in building
