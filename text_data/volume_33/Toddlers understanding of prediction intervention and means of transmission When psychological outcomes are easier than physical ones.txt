see Saxe & Carey, 2006, and Schlottmann, 2000)                          that the events were causal (i.e., causal language).
                                                                    201

expect that effects occur only on contact (Kushnir &
Gopnik, 2007).
   Bonawitz et. al (2010) focused on physical causal events
in which the block contacted a base, which was connected to
the toy by a bright orange wire. From an adult perspective,
a block contacting a base and activating an airplane
connected to the base by a wire does not involve any
violation of contact causality. However, it is possible that
toddlers failed to understand the transmission relationship
involved in these events. The lack of any apparent
transformation or visible transmission of force or energy
within the wire itself might have impaired the children’s
ability to recognize the instantiation of contact causality.
   This suggests the possibility that toddlers might be able to
integrate prediction and action into an adult-like concept of
cause, and might succeed in domains where the transmission
relationships are less restricted: in particular toddlers might
be more successful in the domain of psychological causality
where events can occur either through direct contact or (and
even more typically) at a distance. That is, if we remove
constraints on toddlers’ expectations about mechanisms of
causal transmission, toddlers might have no difficulty with
the basic task of integrating prediction and intervention.
   In the current study we replicate the Bonawitz et al.,
(2010) procedure and compare toddlers’ causal reasoning
about physical outcomes with their reasoning about
psychological outcomes.          We present toddlers with
predictive events in which a block moves spontaneously
