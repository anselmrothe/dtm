Discussion
As predicted, late talkers and early talkers show a difference
in the structure of their noun vocabularies. As a group, late
talkers show more variability in their vocabulary structures
than early talkers. This is perhaps not strange given that, on         Figure 2. Architecture of the networks used in Exp. 2
