for the hypothesis that one’s notion of the Midwest depends
on where in the Midwest one has lived.
               Modeling Midwesternness
We modeled Midwesternness of a state as judged by
Hoosiers using a linear combination of 1) whether the state
is officially in the Midwest, 2) the proportion of businesses
that have Midwest in the name; 3) overlap with the middle
third of the West (Mississippi to the West Coast) of the US
in the East-West direction; 4) overlap with the middle third
of the West in the North-South direction; 5) for officially
Midwestern states, the number of respondents who have
lived in the state; and 6) for states that are either officially
Midwestern or neighboring a Midwestern state, the number
of respondents who have lived in adjacent officially
Midwestern states. The regression accounts for 94% of the
variance in scores among states. Predictors having to do
with the official and “ground truth” notions of the Midwest
(1, 2) are highly significant: t(1,41)=5.15, p<.00001 and
t(1,41)=3.7, p=.0006 respectively. Overlap with the middle
of the West is relatively unimportant: East-West centrality               Figure 5: The Midwest for Hoosiers as predicted by

   The residential history variables (5, 6) are very important,
