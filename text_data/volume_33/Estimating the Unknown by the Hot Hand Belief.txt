   On the other hand, in a basketball game (as well as in
many real world scenarios), it is often the case that the
probability of success is initially unknown. Then, the history
of the previous outcomes can provide some information
about the parameter. As a consequence, the prediction of the
next success, which depends on an estimate of the
parameter, will show positive dependency on the number of
previous successes. Most notably, such prediction does not

each block used a different clock (within-subjects). The
order of 3 blocks was randomized across participants. Each
block consisted of 128 trials, and the binary sequence of 7
dots displayed in each trial was predetermined by randomly
sampling once without replacement from all possible 128
combinations. Thus, all 3 blocks used the same 128 binary
sequences so that participants would experience the same
probability distribution under each condition. Once a binary
sequence was sampled for a trial, the stopping position of
the spinning needle after each spin was determined but
randomly varied within the arc of the corresponding color.
For example, in the “50%-50%” condition, if the program
sampled a “red” outcome, the needle would randomly stop
at one of the six positions of the red arc (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7
o’clock). The stopping position in the “Unknown” condition
always pointed to the 12 o’clock position.
   At the beginning of each trial, a clock was presented in
the center of the computer screen and the needle initially
pointed up (12 o’clock position). Then, the needle was spun
seven times and there was an approximately 1 second pause
after each spin. After each spin, either a blue or a red dot
was shown beneath the clock depending on whether the
needle ended pointing to the blue or red portion of the clock.
After seven spins, seven dots would line up beneath the
clock and a question mark was shown at the eighth position.
Participants used mouse buttons to predict the eighth spin
(left button for blue and right button for red). At the end of
each trial, an instruction screen was displayed to prompt
participants to “proceed to the next clock” by clicking a
mouse button.
