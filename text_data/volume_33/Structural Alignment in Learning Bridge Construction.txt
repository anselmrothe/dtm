Abstract: Laboratory studies show that encouraging comparison between situations through spatial alignment
promotes learning (e.g., Gentner, 2010). We examine whether alignment will also improve learning in a classroom
context. Our study examines 3rd-6th gradersâ€™ ability to learn an engineering concept (the stability of triangles)
when the lesson uses spatial alignment and when it does not. In the aligned condition, we introduce a triangle, a
braced square (consists of two triangles) and a truss (consists of multiple triangles) and spatially align them with
one another. In the unaligned condition, we introduce these same components separately, with no spatial alignment.
Students are given a pretest before the lesson and a post-test after the lesson, both of which assessed knowledge of
the stability of triangles. Preliminary results indicate that students learn more in the aligned condition, suggesting
that alignment is an important learning tool, even in less controlled settings such as a classroom.
