                                               Box 1: An illustration of recipient design.
To illustrate recipient design, consider the following example. Bob and Mary are chatting, while suddenly Bob’s favorite
composition by Bach sounds faintly in the background. Bob wants to communicate three things to Mary:
   i. He wishes her to be quiet;
  ii. He wants her to listen to the music;
 iii. He wants to signal he is listening to the music.
Now suppose that Bob knows that Mary knows they both enjoy Bach very much. To communicate (i), (ii) and (iii) to her he
might simply just put his finger in front of his mouth (a).
                     (a) Bob-Mary                                 (b) Bob-Ann                                (c) Bob-Ann
Placed in a different situation talking to Ann, Bob might communicate differently. He knows Ann likes to keep talking and
that she is not interested in music. He put his finger in front of his mouth to signal Ann to be quiet (i), but he also closes
his eyes to tell her he is listening (iii) (b). To emphasize he is listening (iii) even more, Bob then tilts his head slightly
and puts his finger up in the air, signaling Ann to pay attention and listen to the music (ii) (c). [Illustrations by Bas Maes.]
