         Experiment 1: Forced-Choice Task
The objective of this experiment was to use a one-shot
change detection task to determine the role that object size
plays in judgments of lateral separation. Prior research has
argued that visual angle is the predominant cue in exocentric
distance perception (Levin & Haber, 1993). In other words,
when both depth and separation (i.e., angular size) vary,
observers tend to judge distance using the separation
between objects and ignore relative depth and size cues.
   Gogel and Da Silva’s (1987) two-process theory of off-
sized perceptions, however, predicts that only the primary         Figure 1. Sample conditions from the one-shot change detection
