be improved upon, gain = (posttest – pretest) / (1 – pretest).
   Due to time constraints, two of the fMRI participants did
not complete the posttest. The gain scores for the behavioral
and imaging participants did not differ on any of the three
conditions (for all comparisons, p > .09), so the data for
these two groups were combined. Planned comparisons
showed that rereading gain (M = .30, SD = .23) did not
differ from paraphrasing (M = .35, SD = .24), t < 1. As
expected, self-explanation led to greater learning (M = .41,
SD = .21) than rereading, t(36) = 2.30, p = .028, Cohen's d =
0.38. However, self-explanation learning gains did not differ
from paraphrasing, t(36) = 1.50, p = .14. Prior research has
shown self-explanation to be more effective than
paraphrasing (Moss et al., 2010).
   The zoning out ratings were analyzed in a set of planned
comparisons. Frequency of zoning out was rated higher for
rereading (M = 2.49, SD = .97) than for self-explaining (M                Figure 1: Results of the self-explanation vs. reread
