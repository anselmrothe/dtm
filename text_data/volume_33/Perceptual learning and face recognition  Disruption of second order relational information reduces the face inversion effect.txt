Materials
Six facial features were used for scrambling i.e. the mouth,
nose, two ears and the two eyes (including eyebrows).
Scrambling was done by selecting at random one feature of
the face and moving it to the forehead (chosen because this
is the widest space inside the face and so can accommodate
any feature). Following this, a second feature was selected
and moved to the space left empty by the first feature, and
so on until all the 6 facial features had been moved.
