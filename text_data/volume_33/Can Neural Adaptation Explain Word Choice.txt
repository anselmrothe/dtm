predicted that as a result of this, when presented alone or
alongside a distractor from another basic category, an item will
be referred to by its basic term, while the presence of a distractor
from the same basic category will induce a shift to the target’s
subordinate label. Three simulations taking into account the
relative frequency of an item's basic and subordinate level labels
supported this hypothesis.

After self organization, joint attention is mimicked through
the simultaneous presentation of an object to the visual map
and a word form to the auditory map. Connections between
the activated neurons on each map are strengthened via
Hebbian learning. Due to the topological structure of the
SOMs, many neighbouring units are activated on each map
and Hebbian learning occurs on the synapses connecting
these units as well. This allowed for a single labelling event
to be sufficient to induce taxonomic responding. In addition,
the model also mimicked a typical learning behaviour, e.g. a
vocabulary spurt, a reduction in over-extensions with
increasing vocabulary, etc.
         In spite of its accurate account of the above-
