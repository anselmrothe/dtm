during the five sessions stayed the same in all three

of the beams being uneven. The only difference was
whether the noisy 3cm-beam was included or not. Order of
beams within a session was randomized, and each session
was followed by a short break during which participants
were told that they reached the next level in the activity.

Each trial yielded two scores, one to reflect whether the
mass distribution of a beam was judged correctly (i.e.,
weight judgment), and one to reflect the initial placement of           Figure 3: Mean proportion of correct weight judgment,
