Abstract: Students in a cognitive/computer science class posted blog entries at the rate of two per week and
commented on each other’s contributions. The co-blogging work of the students provided the opportunity to reflect
upon and discuss the course materials and lectures and thereby develop their understanding of the topics and themes
of the course. The discussion of certain topics continued throughout the semester, with students referencing earlier
posts, examples, arguments, and explanations as the ”conversation” progressed. This poster presents a visualization
that depicts the flow of ideas within the online community over the semester. Key notions of the analysis are
seeding, anchoring, and persistence: conversations of new material were seeded with earlier blog content, prior
posts and comments anchored the discourse, and ”common” understanding was mediated by persistent external
representations.
