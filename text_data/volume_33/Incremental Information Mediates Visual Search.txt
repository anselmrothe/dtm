Abstract: Recent studies show that visual search often involves a combination of both parallel and serial search
strategies. Consequently, computational models and theoretical accounts of visual search processing have evolved
from traditional parallel or serial descriptions to a continuum from ”efficient” to ”inefficient.” In our first experiment,
we demonstrate with various control conditions that search efficiency does not increase with simultaneous delivery
of target features in a conjunction search task. In the second experiment, we explore effects of incremental non-
linguistic information delivery and discover improvement of search efficiency. We find a facilitatory effect when visual
non-linguistic delivery of target features is concurrent with the visual display onset, but not when the target features
are delivered prior to display onset. The results support an interactive account of visual perception that explains
linguistic and non-linguistic mediation of visual search as chiefly due to the incrementality of target feature delivery
once search has begun.
