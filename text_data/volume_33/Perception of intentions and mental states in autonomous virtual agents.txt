relate a variable in the environment (the target agent’s mental
state) to the subject’s estimate of that variable. This in turn
allows us to study the inference mechanisms that underlie hu-
man judgments about intentional action.
Agent architecture
The IMPs have a simple visual system with a 1D retina
(Fig. 1B), which they use to gather information about the geo-
metric structure of their environment (Fig. 1C,D). The vision
module uses a ray-casting intersection test for objects along a
small number of lines of sight (see Fig. 1B). Rays that inter-
sect with something in the environment are grouped by color
to create simple object representations, which are then added
to a cumulative mental map of the environment. The IMPS’
principal goal is to gather food (bits of inanimate gray ma-
terial randomly positioned in the environment), though that
goal is occasionally interrupted by various subgoals, like the
need to fend off other agents that they encounter and the need
to explore in order to create their environment map. Their de-
cisions are carried out with the help of a path planning mod-         Figure 1: (a) The virtual environment with its native IMPs (de-

   The IMPs’ behavior is modulated by four distinct ac-               IMPs’ “mental states.” In this condition, the possible under-

Figure 3: Two example scenes from Exp. 1 (left and right panels). Within each panel, the top figure plots physical variables related to the
target IMP, over the course of the 60 s scene. In the left panel, variables intrinsic to the IMP (solid line = speed, dashed line = angular velocity)
are plotted in black; in the right panel, variables related to the IMP’s environmental context are plotted in blue (solid line = distance to nearest
other IMP, dashed line = distance to nearest food). In the bottom figure of each panel, the top bar represents the actual “ground truth” state of
the target IMP (red = “attack”, purple = “explore”, yellow = “flee”, green = “gather”). The other bars represent the corresponding real time
responses of the 4 subjects. Black in the subjects’ bars indicates that the subject had not yet entered a response on the keyboard.
