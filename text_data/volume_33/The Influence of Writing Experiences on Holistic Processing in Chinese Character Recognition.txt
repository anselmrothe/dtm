   Here we aim to investigate the reading and writing
performance differences between proficient Chinese readers
who know how to write (i.e. Writers) and those with
substantially      poorer     writing     performance       (i.e.
limited-writers). In addition, we examine whether writers
perceive characters less holistically than limited-writers, and
whether the reduced holistic processing effect is related to
their reading and writing performance. Since writing practice
may enhance orthographic awareness of characters and
de-emphasize configural information in character
recognition, we predict that writers may be more sensitive to
components and less sensitive to configural information than
limited-writers, and consequently recognize characters with                           500 ms

                                                           was due to their writing experiences and performance in the
