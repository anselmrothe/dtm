                                                                            A.                    B.                   C.
    Many human activities require precise judgments about the
    physical properties and dynamics of multiple objects. Clas-
    sic work suggests that people’s intuitive models of physics
    are relatively poor and error-prone, based on highly simplified
    heuristics that apply only in special cases or incorrect general
    principles (e.g., impetus instead of momentum). These con-
    clusions seem at odds with the breadth and sophistication of
    naive physical reasoning in real-world situations. Our work
    measures the boundaries of people’s physical reasoning and
    tests the richness of intuitive physics knowledge in more com-
    plex scenes. We asked participants to make quantitative judg-
    ments about stability and other physical properties of virtual
    3D towers. We found their judgments correlated highly with a
    model observer that uses simulations based on realistic phys-
    ical dynamics and sampling-based approximate probabilistic           Figure 1: Three towers of varying height and stability. Each tower
