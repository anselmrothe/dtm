complexity, making hypothesis testing more difficult.
   In Experiment 1, participants were explicitly told to

learner is not always prompted to compare examples. One
question that arises is whether comparison, and more

acknowledge that there are other factors that could affect
how comparison type influences learning. For instance, the
degree to which the categories being learned are similar to
each other may play a role in determining which comparison
type is useful. If two categories are similar then they will
share many alignable differences potentially making
between-category comparisons effective for learning.
   In addition, when learning about categories, the goal is
not always just to classify. Future work should address how
comparison type affects other measures of learning, for
instance inference ability and explanation generation.
