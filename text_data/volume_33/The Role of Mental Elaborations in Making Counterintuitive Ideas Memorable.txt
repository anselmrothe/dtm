been applied to the resilience of religious concepts in
various cultures.
An alternative explanation suggests that concepts are only
counterintuitive in a given context (Upal, 2009). This
“context-based” perspective proposes that when individuals
encounter expectation-violating ideas, they struggle to
comprehend the information. In such cases, they make use
of the surrounding episodic context or their general world
knowledge to interpret the violation. Therefore,
counterintuitive concepts experience a memory advantage
because they result in additional elaborative processing.
The purpose of the present set of experiments was to
investigate the hypothesis that elaborative processing results
in a memory advantages observed for minimally
counterintuitive concepts.

Abstract
Previous work has suggested that concepts that are only
slightly counterintuitive are more memorable than concepts
that are intuitive or overly counterintuitive (Boyer, 1994;
Boyer and Ramble, 2001) even though causes for this
memory advantage have been debated (Barrett, 2008; Upal,
2009). This paper presents four studies conducted to better
understand the cognitive processes that underlie memory for
counterintuitive concepts. They suggest that elaborative
processing of counterintuitive concepts may be the primary
driver of the MCI effect rather than domain violation.
Keywords: time, elaborative processing, MCI hypothesis.

Introduction
One important question in the field of cognitive science is
why certain concepts enjoy a memory advantage over
others. Indeed, a considerable amount of research has been
conducted in an effort to answer this question. The results of
this research indicate that two primary factors facilitate
memory performance: elaboration of a concept by a learner
(Anderson & Reder, 1979; Hamilton, 1989), and
distinctiveness of the concept in the given context (Eyesenk,
1979; Hunt & McDaniel, 1992; Hunt & Worthen, 2006; von
Restorff 1933). More recently, Boyer (1994; Boyer &
Ramble, 2001) proposed the minimal counterintuitiveness
(MCI) hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, concepts
that are slightly “counterintuitive” to real-world (i.e., violate
one or two features of the ontological category to which the
item belongs e.g., a tree that talks) are more likely to be
remembered than those that can occur in the real world or
those that are maximally counterintuitive (e.g., an invisible
tree that talks and can see things thousands of miles away).
Boyer argued that this is the case for two reasons: 1.) such
concepts attract attention, increasing the likelihood of
encoding in long-term memory, and 2.) minimally
counterintuitive concepts are easier to categorize than
maximally counterintuitive events. This hypothesis explains
how the nature of a stimulus influences memory
performance and in turn results in the concepts becoming
cultural; that is, they remain across time and space. In
particular, the minimal counterintuitiveness hypothesis has

Experiment 1
The purpose of Experiment 1 was to investigate the nature
of the relation between reading time and recall rate of
intuitive and counterintuitive ideas. Counterintuitive ideas
were divided into two categories: those with only one
feature-violation (low-CI) and those with two feature
violations (high-CI). Both the concept-based view and the
context-based view predict recall should be higher in both
CI conditions compared to the intuitive condition. However,
only the context-based view predicts reading times to be
longer in the two counterintuitive conditions compared to
the intuitive condition.

Participants
32 Providence College undergraduate students
participated. Participants were compensated $5.00 for their
time.

Materials
The materials included two stories titled “Jon’s Travels”
and “Nigel’s Dream (see Appendix for sample story). Each
story began with an introduction, followed by three sets of

985

three intuitive statements, three sets of three minimally
counterintuitive, and three sets of three maximally
counterintuitive ideas. The three conditions were presented
in a mixed order. Each concept was specified using two
sentences. The first sentence introduced the concept and the
second sentence simply repeated the idea without adding
any new information. All sentences were approximately the
same length (between 63 and 69 characters). Intuitive ideas
did not specify any feature violations, while minimally
counterintuitive concepts specified one feature violation,
and maximally counterintuitive concepts specified two
feature violations. Both stories ended with a brief
conclusion.

The results of Experiment 1 lend support to the contextbased view as reading times on statements containing
counterintuitive concepts were in fact longer than intuitive
statements. In addition, recall rates were also higher for
counterintuitive concepts compared to intuitive concepts.
The pattern of results indicates that the additional time spent
processing material facilitates memory performance.
However, another possibility is that counterintuitive ideas
take longer to process and they are also more memorable
but the longer processing time does not cause them to be
more memorable. Since Experiment 1 did not have a
control group of non-counterintuitive sentences that also
took longer to process, we cannot discount this possibility.
The second experiment addressed this shortcoming.

Procedures
Participants read the two stories on a computer screen, one
sentence at a time. They were allowed to take as much time
as they needed to process each sentence. After reading each
sentence they were instructed to press the space bar to
continue to the next sentence. Reading time for each
sentence was recorded as the time between key presses.
After reading the two stories, participants were presented
with two pieces of paper. Each sheet of paper had the title of
the story written across the top. The participants were
instructed to write down as much as they could remember
about each story.

Experiment 2
Past work has shown that negated sentences take longer to
read (Sherman, 1976). Given the results of Experiment 1,
the increased processing time should facilitate memory
performance for such concepts as well. The purpose of the
second experiment was to examine memory performance for
counterintuitive concepts that were negated. Participants
read the same stories from Experiment 1. However, the
high-counterinituitive condition was replaced with a negated
condition in which a counterintuitive concept was negated.
For instance, consider the following statements:

Results and Discussion
All analyses were significant by the .05 level unless
otherwise indicated. The subject responses were coded for
recall by assigning the value 1 if the gist of the concept was
thought to have been recalled by the subject. A score of 0
was assigned otherwise. The proportion of recall was
measured by dividing the number of concepts recalled by
subjects by the total number of concepts of that type
embedded in the story. The reading time and proportion of
recall for each statement are shown in see Table 1. For
reading time, there was a significant main effect F(2,62) =
19.04, MSE = 150473.86. Planned comparisons revealed
that reading times were significantly longer in the low –
counterintuitive
(L-MCI)
condition
and
high
counterintuitive (H-MCI) condition compared to the
intuitive (INT) condition F(1,31) = 37.35, MSE =
167396.84, and F(1, 31) = 26.19, MSE = 64610.75,
respectively. However, the difference between these two
conditions was insignificant, p > .05. There was also a
significant main effect for recall, F(2,62) = 7.10, MSE =
.018. Recall rate was significantly higher in the L-MCI
condition compared to the INT condition F(1,31) = 74.42,
MSE = .101, and was also higher in the MXCI condition
compared to the intuitive condition F(1,31) = 7.04, MSE =
.038. However, the difference between the L-MCI and HMCI conditions was insignificant, p > .05.

He came upon a man who was not able to figure out
how to fly.
He would jump off a roof and flap his arms but it
didn’t work.
In these sentences the counterintuitive concept of a man
flying is negated, thus the concept is entirely intuitive.
Given that previous work has shown that negated sentences
take longer to read, it is likely that reading times will be
longer for these sentences. According to the context-based
view, the additional processing time should result in better
memory performance for such statements. However, the
traditional content-based version of the MCI hypothesis
(Boyer & Ramble 2001; Barrett & Nyhoff 2001; Barrett
2008) predicts that minimally counterintuitive ideas enjoy a
memory advantage over intuitive ideas. Because the negated
statements are intuitive, memory performance for the
negated statements should be the same as the intuitive
statements.

Participants
Participants were 30 Providence College undergraduate
students who were compensated $5.00 for their time.

Materials
The pattern of reading time paired with recall mirrors
Experiment 1. In conditions where we observed longer
reading time, we also saw better memory performance. This
is especially interesting in the negated condition as those
concepts are actually intuitive. The fact that recall was
significantly higher in the negated condition than in the
intuitive condition contradicts the concept-based view of the
MCI hypothesis. However, the results are consistent with
the context-based view; increased reading time results in
additional elaboration of the material, in turn, facilitating
memory performance.

The materials were the same as Experiment 1 with one
modification. The H-MCI statements were replaced with
negated statements. The first sentence introduced a
counterintuitive concept that was negated. The second
sentence elaborated on the first. Again, all statements
contained 63-69 characters.

Procedures
The procedures were the same as Experiment 1.

Results and Discussion
Average reading time and recall rates are presented in
Table 2. There was a main effect of condition, F(2,58) =
10.59, MSE = 113352.88. Reading times were longer in the
MCI condition compared to the negated condition, F(1,29) =
15.22, MSE = 161829.76, p < .05 and the intuitive condition
F(1,29) = 14.77, MSE = 301027.99. Reading times in the
negated and intuitive conditions did not differ significantly,
p > .05. The fact that reading time was shorter in the
negated condition was inconsistent with previous work
(Sherman, 1976). Therefore, we decided to look at average
reading for the first and second sentence in each condition.
For the first sentence, there was a main effect of condition,
F (2,58) = 5.38, MSE = 170471.57. Reading times in the
MCI and negated conditions were significantly longer than
the intuitive condition, F(1,29) = 5.60, MSE = 411986.44
and F(1,29) = 12.53, MSE = 250368.30. However, the
difference between the MCI and negated conditions was
insignificant p > .05. For the second sentence, there was
also a significant main effect, F(2,58) = 21.39, MSE =
145250.52. Reading times were longer in the MCI condition
compared to the negated condition, F(1,29) = 53.07, MSE =
233154.06, and intuitive condition, F(1,29) = 12.19, MSE =
314394.66. Interestingly, reading times were significantly
faster in the negated compared to the intuitive condition
F(1,29) = 7.51, MSE = 232951.40.
There was also a significant main effect for recall, F(2,58)
= 16.75, MSE = .015. Recall rates were significantly higher
in the MCI condition compared to the intuitive condition,
F(1,29) = 45.97, MSE = .02, were higher in the negated
condition compared to the intuitive condition, F(1,29) =
14.09, MSE = .04. The difference between the MCI and
negated conditions was insignificant, p > .05.

Experiment 3
The purpose of Experiment 3 was to examine whether the
memory advantages observed in Experiments 1 and 2 results
from time spent with the material or elaborative processing
which involves successful resolution of an inconsistency (or
expectation violation), as hypothesized by the context-based
view. Participants read the same stories from Experiment 1.
However, the low-MCI statements were replaced with
statements that were nonsensical. For instance:
One woman he met was able to cut swimming with
midnight cues.
She was in the process of carving as he watched her for
some time.
If time alone facilitates memory performance, then recall
for such statements should be high. However, according to
the context-based perspective, it is the successful resolution
of expectation-violating or inconsistent material that
enhances memory performance, as it results in a more
integrated memory trace. In the case of the nonsensical
material, resolution of the expectation violations is very
unlikely, if not impossible, for most readers. Thus, although
reading times should be longer for such statements
compared to intuitive or counterintuitive statements, recall
should be lower compared to the other conditions.

Participants
Participants were 30 Providence College undergraduate
students who received $5.00 for their time.

coherently. This resulted in an impoverished memory trace
in which concepts from those statements were not integrated
with one another or with the context, making retrieval of the
ideas more difficult.

127689.28. Planned comparisons revealed that reading
times were significantly longer in the counterintuitive (HMCI) condition and nonsense condition compared to the
intuitive (INT) condition F(1,29) = 66.69, MSE =
281880.26 and F(1, 29) = 128.07, MSE = 214729.79,
respectively. Although the difference between the high
MCI and nonsense conditions was insignificant, there was a
trend, F(1,29) = 3.14, MSE = 269525.66, p = .08. One
likely reason there was not a significant difference between
the two was that the second sentence in the nonsense
condition made logical sense. Therefore, it is likely that
reading times were quite long on the first sentence, but not
on the second sentence. In order to address this, we
analyzed reading time for the first and second sentence
across all conditions. There was a main effect for the first
sentence, F(2,58) = 40.06, MSE = 679873.13. Reading
times were significantly longer in the nonsense condition
compared to the MCI condition, F(1,29) = 14.62, MSE =
1306316.78 and the intuitive condition F(1,29) = 56.49,
MSE = 1912418.71. In addition, reading times were
significantly longer for the MCI statements compared to the
intuitive statements, F(1,29) = 42.18, MSE = 860503.29.
There was also a main effect for the second sentence,
F(2,58) = 12.36, MSE = 393050.17. Reading times in the
nonsense condition were significantly longer than the
intuitive condition, F(1,29) = 22.40, MSE = 391610.96.
Reading times in the MCI condition were also longer than
the intuitive condition, F(1,29) = 17.02, MSE = 1091012.88.
However, reading times on the second sentence were not
significantly different in the nonsense and MCI conditions,
p = .16.
There was also a significant main effect for recall, F(2,58)
= 32.83, MSE = .011. Recall was significantly higher in the
MCI condition compared to the INT condition, F(1,29) =
11.66, MSE = .029 and was also higher in the MCI
compared to the nonsense condition, F(1,29) = 89.40, MSE
= .02. Finally, recall was higher in the INT condition
compared to the nonsense condition, F(1,29) = 18.39, MSE
= .02.

Experiment 4
The fourth experiment compared processing of maximally
counterintuitive (MXCI) statements with minimally
counterintuitive and nonsensical statements. Participants
read statements that were either nonsensical (from
Experiment 3), minimally counterintuitive (the H-MCI
items from Experiment 1), or maximally counterintuitive
(containing three feature violations, consistent with Barrett,
2008). Both the concept-based and the context-based views
predict that reading time for maximally counterintuitive
statements will be longer than minimally counterintuitive
statements, but memory performance will be lower for
maximally counterintuitive concepts compared to minimally
counterintuitive concepts.

Participants
30 Providence College students participated and were
compensated $5.00 for their time.

Materials
The materials included the nonsensical concepts from
Experiment 3, the minimally counterintuitive (H-MCI)
statements from Experiment 1, and maximally
counterintuitive statements containing three ontological
domain/feature violations.

Procedures
The procedures were the same as Experiments 1-3.

Results
The average reading times and proportion of recall for
each condition are presented in see Table 4. For reading
time, there was a significant main effect, F(2,58) = 24.08,
MSE = 1175771.96. Planned comparisons revealed that
reading times were significantly longer in the nonsense
condition compared to the maximally counterintuitive
(MXCI) condition and minimally counterintuitive (H-MCI)
condition, F(1,29) = 15.07, MSE = 2100332.65and F(1, 29)
= 29.27, MSE = 3864886.12, respectively. Reading times
were also significantly longer in the MXCI condition
compared to the H-MCI condition, F(1,29) = 23.04, MSE =
1089412.99. We also analyzed the data for the first and
second sentence. There was a significant main effect for the
first sentence, F(2,58) = 49.10, MSE = 1152799.28.
Reading times on the first sentence were significantly longer
in the nonsense condition compared to the MXCI condition,
F(1,29) = 20.80, MSE = 2776862.60 and were also
significantly longer in the nonsense condition compared to
the MCI condition, F(1,29) = 66.03, MSE = 3429027.57. In
addition, reading times were significantly longer for the

Proportion Recall

Although participants took more time to read the
nonsense statements compared to the INT and nonsense
statements, recall was significantly worse for those
concepts. It is very likely that the fact that the statements
were nonsensical prevented resolution. In other words,
because the material was largely incomprehensible, readers

advantage because such ideas require additional elaborative
processing, resulting in a more integrated memory trace.
However, Experiments 3 and 4 indicate the additional
processing doesn’t always improve memory performance,
likely because in some cases the additional processing does
not result in successful interpretation and/or integration of
the material in memory.
These results along with a growing set of experimental
findings (see review in Upal, 2009) lend support to the
context-based view of the MCI hypothesis, which argues
that counterintuitiveness is not a property of the concepts
alone, but rather it is a property of the concepts along with
the context in which they are embedded.

MXCI statements compared to the MCI statements, F(1,29)
= 78.00, MSE = 710905.48. There was no main effect for
the second sentence, p = .85. Planned comparisons revealed
no significant differences between the three conditions.
There was a significant main effect for recall, F(2,58) =
40.57, MSE = .008. Recall rate was significantly higher in
the H-MCI condition compared to the nonsense condition
F(1,29) = 70.29, MSE = .019 and was also higher in the HMCI compared to the MXCI condition F(1,29) = 25.56,
MSE = .023. Finally, recall was higher in the MXCI
condition compared to the nonsense condition, F(1,29) =
16.45, MSE = .009.

The pattern of reading time suggests that participants
struggled with the information in the MXCI condition more
than in the MCI condition, even though there was only one
additional counterintuitive feature. This finding is important
for two reasons. First, it is consistent with Barrett’s (2008)
operational definition of MXCI and thus lends support to his
coding scheme. Second, it suggests that MXCI material is,
in fact, more difficult to process than minimally
counterintuitive statements. However, processing of that
material was not as difficult as in the nonsense condition.
Reading times were significantly longer in the nonsense
condition compared to the MXCI condition, suggesting the

the recall data – recall was significantly worse in the

conditions.

General Discussion
Why certain concepts enjoy a memory advantage over
others is an interesting question for cognitive science
because it furthers our understanding of how certain cultural
ideas became widespread (Boyer, 1994). This paper
documents the results of a number of novel experiments
conducted to better understand cognitive processes that
underlie memory for various types of concepts. This is the
first study to compare reading times for intuitive, minimally
counterintuitive, and maximally counterintuitive concepts.
It is also the first study to measure recall rates for maximally
counterintuitive concepts embedded in narratives while
systematically comparing those recall rates with intuitive
and nonsensical concepts. Our results indicate that
minimally counterintuitive concepts enjoy a memory

Appendix
Sample Story: Jon’s Travels
Introduction
Jon is a trader who has been to many places. One day, after
he had come back from a journey to distant places, he told
his friends about the people he had seen. Some of those
people are like you and me and others are different. Jon met
a lot of interesting people.
Low-MCI (Experiment 1 and 2)
One girl was interesting because she could be in two places
at once.
He could see her talking to two different people in different
rooms.
Intuitive (Experiment 1)
There was also a man who could recognize people he had
met before.
If he met someone once he was able to easily remember that
person.
Negated (Experiment 2 only)
He was introduced to a boy who was unable to radiate blue
light.
No matter how hard he tried, he just could not manage to do
it.
High-MCI (Experiment 1, 3, and 4)
One boy radiated blue light and turned to stone if you
touched him.
The people he stood next to glowed while keeping a safe
distance.
Nonsense (Experiments 3 and 4)
One girl was interesting because she colored sleep into
purple ideas.
He spent an entire hour observing and analyzing her unique
skill.
MXCI (Experiment 4 only)
One boy radiated blue light, shed his skin, and saw through
walls.
The men he stood next to were afraid of him and kept their
distance.
Low-MCI (Experiment 1 and 2)
One woman he met was able to cut metal with only her
pinky finger.
She was carving a doorway and a window near the back of
the room.
Intuitive (Experiment 1 only)
There was another person who could accurately predict the
weather.
She could tell you if it was going to thunderstorm the next
day.
Negated (Experiment 2 only)
He then came upon a statue of a woman that was unable to
cry.
