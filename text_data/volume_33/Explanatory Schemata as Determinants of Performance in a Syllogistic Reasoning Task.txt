Abstract: Recent findings have demonstrated that explanations provided by scientists are deemed better when
they are supplemented with scientific evidence even when that evidence is irrelevant (Weisberg, Keil, Goodstein,
Rawson, & Gray, 2008). In the present study, participants were asked to solve a syllogistic reasoning task. Two
kinds of irrelevant explanations were provided: mechanistic explanations (e.g., forces, cause-and-effect) and anthro-
pomorphic statements (e.g., like, want). Participants were further told either that ’scientists’ or ’people’ provided
the explanations. Descriptions of natural phenomena were presented ranging in terms of the extent to which they
were human-like (e.g., molecules, snakes, human group) to alter the congruency of the explanations and descriptions.
Supporting our earlier findings (Schoenherr & Thomson, 2009), we found that participants performed better when
there was a congruency between the explanations and natural phenomena and when scientists provided mechanistic
explanations and people provided anthropomorphic explanations.
