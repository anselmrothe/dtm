Abstract: In naturalistic settings, it is sometimes ambiguous whether or not a particular exemplar exhibits various
properties indicative of category membership. We show that individuals prefer to group exemplars into categories
that have a narrower latent scope – categories that specify fewer unobserved features – to those with a broader scope.
In Experiment 1, participants classified suspects with fewer unobserved features as more likely to have committed
a crime. In Experiment 2, participants were more likely to categorize novel creatures as part of a group that had a
narrower latent scope. Experiment 3 showed that participants were more willing to make inductions about unknown
features based on a narrower latent scope categorization.
