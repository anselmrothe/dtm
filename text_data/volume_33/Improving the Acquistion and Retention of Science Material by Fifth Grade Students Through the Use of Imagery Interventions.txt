Improving the Acquistion and Retention of Science Material by Fifth
Grade Students Through the Use of Imagery Interventions

Abstract: This study examined imagery interventions for the presentation of novel science vocabulary to fifth grade
learners. Participants were randomly assigned to four different instructional interventions: a Picture Presentation
method, in which a word was paired with a picture; an Image Creation- No Picture method, in which the participants
were told to create an image of the word and draw it on paper; an Image Creation- Picture method, in which the
students were presented with the picture and then told to draw it; and a Word Only method, which involved the
simple verbal presentation of the word. Results demonstrated that students in the imagery intervention groups scored
significantly higher on the outcome measures. It was also shown that the deeper the students processed the ”to be
learned” vocabulary words, the higher they scored. Such a study has implications as to the most effective way to
teach vocabulary in the classroom.
