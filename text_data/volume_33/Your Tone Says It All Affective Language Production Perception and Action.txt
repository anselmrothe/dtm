Abstract: Language, prosody and social cues to affective speech are essential for successful interpretation of intent
(Attardo, Eisterhold, Hay & Pogi, 2005). Nygaard and Lunders (2002) have shown that affective prosody impacts the
resolution of lexical ambiguity during spoken language, yet social cues are understudied. The current studies evaluate
the impact of affective prosody and social factors (e.g., gender and perceived identity through dialect) associated
with the production, perception and action upon intent behind spoken language. The results from the production
study suggest that affect production may involve a substantial amount of talker variability. Though there was a
considerable amount of talker variability in the productions, listeners seem to easily and accurately categorize intent,
thus, relying heavily on talker related cues. Therefore, it would seem that talker variability, in the form of prosodic
variation and social cues influence a listenerâ€™s interpretation during the online processing intent.
