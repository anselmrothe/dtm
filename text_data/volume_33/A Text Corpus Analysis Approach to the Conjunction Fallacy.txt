Abstract
This study aimsto explain theconjunction fallacy
(Tversky&Kahneman, 1983) in terms of degree of
confirmation (Crupi, Tentori, & Gonzalez,2007) by
employing corpus data analysis. To accomplish this,
wecalculated indexes of the degrees of confirmation fromthe
British National Corpus and fitted them to dataof the previous
study (Shafir et al., 1990). The resultsshow that a major index
of the degree of confirmation(Crupi et al., 2007) can
significantly predict theconjunction fallacy, indicating a
relationship betweenthe conjunction fallacy and degree of
confirmationas well asthe importance of corpus data to
explain biasesin judgment.

Introduction
The conjunction fallacy (Tversky&Kahneman, 1983) is
one of the most famous violations of the normative axiom of
probability. A representative experiment of this
phenomenon asked participants to think about Linda as she
is described in the following sentences:
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very
bright.She majored in philosophy. As a student, she
was deeplyconcerned with issues of discrimination and
social justice,and also participated in antinuclear
demonstrations.
Then, participants were required to rank various
statements about Linda “by their probability.” Two of
thesestatements were“B” and “B and F”:
(B) Linda is a bank teller.
(B and F) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the
feministmovement.
In Tversky and Kahneman (1983), 85% of the participants
ranked“B and F” as more probable than “B.” This judgment
is in apparent violationof the conjunction law Pr(X and
Y|Z)<Pr(X|Z) forany statements X, Y, and Z, with strict
inequality for nontrivialcases such as the present
example.Tversky and Kahneman refer to this violation as
the conjunction fallacy, and many studies have replicatedit
under
various
experimental
conditions
(see

Hertwig&Chase,1998, for a review of findings; the original
report is Tversky&Kahneman, 1983).
Many theoretical explanations for the conjunction fallacy
as well as the replications have been reported (for a review,
see Costello, 2009; Sides, Osherson, Bonini, &Viale, 2002).
Some researchers (e.g., Crupi, Fitelson, &Tentori, 2008;
Tversky&Kahneman, 1983) suggest that participants’
responses in the conjunction fallacy are not based solely on
the probability of the conjunction itself but also on other
factors
such
as
the
representative
heuristics
(Tversky&Kahneman, 1981) or degree of the confirmation
given by the conjunctions. Other researchers assume that
participants utilize their pragmatic knowledge to understand
meanings of the experimental materials employed in studies
on the conjunction fallacy. This approach focuseson
assumptions about how participants answer in the
experimental tasks (Chase, Hertwig, &Gigerenzer, 1998;
Dulany& Hilton,1991; Macdonald &Gilhooly, 1986;
Morier&Borgida, 1984; Politzer&Noveck, 1991), saying
that participants, correctly following the pragmatics of
communication rather than the logical meaning in the
experimental task, interpret the single statement B
asmeaning “B^notA” and so rightly prefer the conjunction
B^A (Dulany& Hilton, 1991; MacDonald &Gilhooly, 1990;
Politzer&Noveck, 1991). In addition, researchers have
recently proposed that the conjunction fallacy is an artifact
that occursdue to unnatural experimental settings
(Hertwig&Gigerenzer, 2002),possibly incombination with
measurement error (Costello, 2008).
We seek to propose another explanation of the conjunction
fallacy that is inspired by a recent development of the
concept of confirmation (Carnap, 1955; Fitelson, 1999;
Crupi, Tentori, & Gonzalez, 2007) and utilizes statistical
corpus analysis. In what follows, we will argue how theories
of confirmation can explain the conjunction fallacy. In
addition, we will also present a solution to these
problemsusingstatistical corpus analysis.

Degree of confirmation
Consider a situation in whicha rational agent collects data
for hypothesis confirmation. The strength of the agent’s
belief about the hypothesis after seeing the data can be
described as the posterior probability of the hypothesis,
defined by Bayes’ theorem, shown in (1):

1527

P(h | d ) =

P ( h) P ( d | h)
P(d )

As you can see, Bayes’ theorem defines a relationship
between the prior belief (P(h)) and the posterior belief. In
this vein, whether the data support the hypothesis or not can
be represented by the difference between the prior and
posterior probabilities; when the posterior probability is
higher than the prior probability, the data support the
hypothesis, and when not, they disconfirmit. Thus, degree of
confirmation c(h, d) can be expressed as shown in (2):

⎧> 0, P(h | d ) > P(h)
⎪
c(h, d )⎨= 0, P(h | d ) = P(h)
⎪< 0, P(h | d ) < P(h)
⎩

c ( h1 , e) ≤0

(1)

(2)

We must mention that it is possible to define many kinds
of criteria that can satisfy the equation in (2).This equation
solely proposes that the data support the hypothesis if the
posterior probability is higher than the prior probability;it
does not determine the degree of support. In fact, there are
various types of criteria for degree of confirmation that can
satisfy (2). Table 2 shows representative indexes of the
degrees of confirmation (also see Eells&Fitelson, 2002;
Fitelson, 1999; Tentori, Crupi, Bonini, &Fitelson, 2007).
Tentori, Crupi, Bonini, and Fitelson (2007) report on
experiments that compared the adequacy of several such
measures as descriptions of confirmation judgmentin a
probabilistic context. In the experiments, they showed
participants two opaque urns that contained different
numbers of white and black balls, and the numbers of each
were known to the participants. Then, participants randomly
chose one of the two urns by a coin toss, but the outcome of
the coin toss was unknown to them. After selecting an urn in
this way, the participants were required to draw a ball and
estimate the impact of the results of the ball drawing with
various types of response scales in 10 successive trials.
Based on the number of balls that the two urns contained,
theparticipants calculated various types of the confirmation
indexes and compared them to the estimated degree of
confirmation. Results showed that some of the confirmation
indexes significantly correlate to the participants’ responses,
indicating that human hypothesis confirmation follows
rational thought as the Bayesian agent is assumed to do so.
Crupi, Fitelson, and Tentori (2008) suggest that the
conjunction fallacy can be explained in terms of the
Bayesian hypothesis confirmation. They insist that
participants in the conjunction fallacy experiments do not
consider probabilities for conjunctions or each proposition
that composes the conjunction. Rather, they appear to
estimate how the description supports the conjunction as
data. Based on this idea, Crupi, Fitelson, and Tentori specify
a condition in which the degree of confirmation for the
conjunction becomes larger than that for each proposition.
This condition is shown in (3):

and

c ( h2 , e | h1) ≥1,

then c ( h1 & h2 | e) ≥c ( h1 , e)

(3)

Another important feature of the condition is its
robustness; Crupi et al. (2008) also show that this condition
holds any confirmation measures, including D, R, L, C, S,
and Z (table 1). In other words, each of these confirmation
measures can explain the conjunction fallacy if people’s
probability judgment about conjunction depends on the
degree of confirmation. Thus, not only whether the degree
of confirmation but also what measure can explain the
conjunction fallacy is an interesting empirical question.
Table 1.variation of the degree of conformation

D(A, E) = p(A | E) − p(A)
(Carnap, 1950; Eells, 1982)

C(A, E) = p(A & E) − p(A) × p(E)
(Carnap, 1950)

S(A, E) = p(A | E) − p(A | ¬E)
(Christensen, 1999; Joyce, 1999)

⎧ p(A | E) − p(A)
if p(A | E) ≥ p(A)
⎪⎪ 1 − p(A)
Z(A, E) = ⎨
⎪ p(A | E) − p(A)
otherwise
⎪⎩
p(A)
(Crupi, Tentori& Gonzalez, 2007)
However, one methodological problem of Crupi et al.’s
(2007) explanation lies in how to determine probabilities
related to the conjunction. All the confirmation measures,
although they are not probabilities themselves, require
values of probabilities for h1, h2, and e. In the experimental
paradigm of the conjunction fallacy, this requirement is very
difficult to fill, because the conjunction fallacy demonstrates
that peoples’ probability judgments for these components
deviate from the normative principle. In other words, we
cannot define the values of the probabilities required to
calculate the degree of confirmation from probability
judgment data. Rather, it is desirable to define the
probability values based on objective data, not on subjective
probability judgments.

Statistical corpus analysis
Statistical corpus analysis can address the above problems.
Statistical corpora containlarge amounts of sentences that
are collected from natural language communication such as
literature (British National Corpus) or newspapers
(Mainichi-shinbun database) and enableresearchers to
access information on word frequencies or co-occurrences.

1528

These databases can be considered as reflecting everyday
verbal communication and have assumed to be
substitutionsfor
human
memory
structure
(e.g.,
Steyvers&Tenenbaum, 2006; Stewart, Chater, & Brown,
2006).
Recently, the number of studiesthatattempt to describe
human reasoning with corpus statistical data has been
increasing (e.g., Sakamoto & Nakagawa, 2007; Stewart,
Chater, & Brown, 2006; Terai & Nakagawa, 2007; Utsumi,
2010).These studies assume that frequencies of appearance
or co-occurrence among words reflect word affinities or the
strength of associative connections among words and
substitutethem as parameters for statistical models. For
example, Sakamoto and Nakagawa (2007) hypothesized
cognitive processes of category-based induction (e.g.,
Osherson et al., 1990) as classification based on associations
between premises and conclusions, and employed
probabilities for co-occurrence among the words that are
contained in the premise and conclusion. The results of their
study supported the hypothesis, suggesting that probabilistic
properties of corpus data reflect basic knowledge of human
reasoning.
Additionally, applying the corpus data analysis approach
to the issue of the conjunction fallacy appears to be very
natural upon inspection oftheexperimental procedure. In the
typical experiment, participants read sentences that describe
features of characters, such as “outspoken” or
“philosophical,” and are required to rank alternatives (e.g.,
“bank teller,”“feminist”) by their probability. In this
situation, it is natural to assume that participants access their
memory to solve the task and that this assessment to their
memory affects their probability judgment foreach
proposition. If corpus data reflect memory strength of the
words contained in the stimulus sentences, we can employ
the corpus data to test Crupi et al.’s (2007) hypothesis.

The purpose of this study
From the above discussion, we derive the following
hypothesis about the conjunction fallacy; in the
experimental
procedure
of
the
conjunction
fallacy,participants estimate the degree of confirmation for
the conjunction by assessing their memory strength. To test
this hypothesis, we report two studies. The first reanalyzed
the data of Shafir, Smith, and Osherson (1990) that are
adequate to test our approach. The second collected new
data from Japanese participants. In both studies, we
calculate parameters of the degrees of probability with any
given assumptionusinga language corpus and examine the
idea that the conjunction fallacy occurs as a result of the
Bayesian updating of degree of the confirmation.

Study 1: Reanalysis of Shafir et al. (1990)
The purpose of Study 1 is to test our hypothesis by
reanalyzing the data of Shafir et al (1990). Shafir et al
(1990) required participants to rate probabilities of
occurrence of the contents of both 15 conditional sentences
and combinations of propositions. The sentences that were
judged by participants had the frame: Every single in the
group is . For example, they employed stimulus sentences
such as those below in order to considerthe conjunction
fallacy by comparing single and conjunctive condition texts:
Single condition:
“Every single lawyer in the group is conservative.”
Conjunctive condition:
“Every single labor-union lawyer in the group is
conservative.”
In this case, the data (e) is “conservative” and single
hypothesis (h1) and conjunctive hypothesis (h1&h2) are
“lawyer” and “labor-union lawyer,” respectively. The
participants were request to rate the probability of each
conditions.They calculated the degree of fallacy by
subtracting the probability of the single condition from the
probability of the conjunctive condition.
In Shafir et al.’s (1990) experiment, the attributes of the
data (e) and hypothesis (h1, h2) are comprised of one word.
In such experiments on the conjunction fallacy using stimuli,
it is natural to assume that participants’ judgments are
dependent on the characteristics and relationships of each
word; therefore, it is very appropriate to consider the
connection of language statistics and the conjunction fallacy.
Thus, we selected it as the subject of analysis of this study.
This study compares the degree of conformation that was
calculatedform the occurrence and co-occurrence
probabilities of words in a language corpus and the results
of the conjunction fallacy experiment performed by Shafir
et al. (1990).
We use the British National Corpus (BNC) as language
statistical data. The BNC, launched in 1991, is the world’s
largest English corpus, consisting of approximately 100
million words including both British written and colloquial
words, and is designed to represent modern British English
as broadly as possible. It consists of approximately 90%
written words and 10% colloquial words. Data to be added
are selected based on statistical value by area of the number
of annual publications in the UK. We decided to usethe
BNC as the original data source for calculating the degree of
probability for the study because it contains enough data,
and the date on which the original BNC texts were prepared
is close to, or prior to, the date Shafir et al.’s (1990)
experiment was performed.

The degree of probability was calculated through the
following procedure.
First, we calculated occurrence and co-occurrence
probabilities. We picked up 5,101,034 sentences by BNC. A
frequency of a word (e.g. h1) was counted according to
whether the word (h1) is included in each sentence. The
occurrence probability of h1 was calculated as follows,

1

/

where the nall is a number of all sentences (nall = 5,101,034),
and the nh1 is the frequency of the word (h1) .
In the case of co-occurrence (e.g. h1&h2), we counted a
co-frequency according to whether both words (h1) and (h2)
are included in each sentence. The co-occurrence
probability p(h1 & h2) was calculated as follows,

1& 2

&

/

where the nh1&h2 is the co-frequency of words (h1 &
h2).According to the above procedure, all occurrence and
co-occurrence probabilities for calculation of the
confirmation-degree are calculated.
Then, after the calculating conditional probability based
on Bayes’ theorem, we calculated the degree of
confirmation (c(h1,e), and c(h1&h2,e) for each confirmation
measures)to determine the degrees of probability of the
conjunction and each proposition. Finally, we calculated the
correlation coefficient between the degree of fallacy of
Shafir et al. (1990) and c(h1&h2,e)-c(h1,e).
Scatter plots in Figure 1 demonstrate relationships
among the data of Shafir et al. (1990) and values of the
confirmation measures that are calculated from the BNC.
Among the four confirmation measures, only Z correlated to
the data significantly (r= 0.76, p< 01). These results support
our proposition that the degree of confirmation calculated
from the corpus data can explain the conjunction fallacy. Of
course, robustness of the current results should be examined
by another study, and Study 2 attempts to replicate this
finding by using Japanese corpus in Japanese participants

In study 2, we conductedanexperimentby using Japanese
corpus for Japanese participants. The participants were 77
Japanesecollege students in a computer-literacy class.In the
experiment, we used same contents that used in Study 1and
translated those 15 conditional sentences and combinations
of propositions in Japanese.Participants were given the
personality character and required to select one statement as
most probable.
For example, participants were asked to think about a
person Awho is described in the following sentences:
“A is conservative. “
Then, participants were required to select one statement
from three statements as most probable about person A.
Three of these statements were as follows,
i. A is lawyer.
ii. A is labor unionist.
iii. A is labor-unionist and lawyer.
In this case, the data (e) is “conservative,” and two single
hypothesis (h1, h2) and conjunctive hypothesis (h1&h2) are
“lawyer”, “labor unionist” and “labor-unionist and lawyer,”
respectively. In study2, a degree of fallacy is defined by
selected ratio of conjunctive statement (ⅲ).
In study2, we use a Japanese corpus data that consists of
approximately 650 million words, which extracted from 18yearsspan of a Japanese news paper (Mainichi Shinbun),
9706 books (by Aozora Bunko), two encyclopedias (Gakken
KokugoDaijiten, Nihon HyakkaJiten) and Blog data. This
Japanese corpus data consists of approximately 67% news
papers, 8% books, 15% blogs and 10% encyclopedias. The
degree of confirmation (c(h1,e), c(h2,e) and c(h1&h2,e) for
each confirmation measures) was calculated through the
same procedure in Study 1. We calculated the correlation
coefficient between c(h1&h2,e) – c(h1,e) (or c(h1&h2,e) –
c(h2,e)) and the degree of fallacy of the result of experiment.
Figure. 2 show the relationshipsamong the data of
experimental result and values of the confirmation measures
that are calculated from Japanese corpus. In the case of
thec(h1&h2,e) – c(h1,e), Z correlated to the data
significantly (r= 0.64, p< .05) , and the relation between
c(h1&h2,e) – c(h2,e) and the degree of fallacy shows
marginal significant positive correlations in the degree of Z
(r= .46, p< .1).

Discussion
The results of the two studies consistently showed that
conjunction fallacy is explained by the degree of
confirmation that can be defined by difference between
prior and posterior probability that are reflected in the
corpus data. These results are consistent with the hypotheses
by Crupi et al. (2007), and can be positioned as another
example that succeeded to explore cognitive processes of
human reasoning by utilizing the corpus data.
We argue that the corpus data analysis is prospective
approach to explore biases in human reasoning. Although
the corpus data have been used to explore human reasoning
such as category-based induction (Sakamoto & Nakagawa,
2007) or metaphor understanding (Terai & Nakagawa,
2007), application to the domain of cognitive biases very
novel. We think that probabilistic aspects of the corpus data
are useful for investigation to various agendas of decisionmaking research. We are planning to perform similar
analyses and experiments on such decision making agendas
to assess the probability of prediction of human decisionmaking through calculation of degree of probability based
on language corpus.
Among the various types of the criteria of degree of
confirmation, Z showed the highest fit to the data. This
finding is meaningful because it suggests general cognitive
processes for probability judgment including the
conjunction fallacy. As the expression show in Table 2
indicates, this index defines degree of the confirmation as
normalized difference between prior and posterior
probability: when the targethypothesis is supported, sum of
prior probabilities for hypothesis other than the target
hypothesis becomes a normalizing term, and when
disconfirmed, prior probability of the target hypothesis
become the normalizing term. In other words, this index

Z

uses set of the disconfirmed hypotheses as the normalizing
term. In this vein, this index considers degree of
confirmation as a result of competition between the target
and the other hypothesis. This finding corresponds to recent
findings that consider human reasoning as comparison
between the target and alternative hypothesis (e. g.,
McKenzie & Amin, 2002; McKenzie &Mikkelsen, 2002,
2007). In addition superiority of Z suggests a coherency of
human judgment because it satisfies the conditions needed
to be a coherent index of confirmation (Crupi et al, 2007). In
sum, the current results suggest a possibility that
conjunction fallacy can be positioned as result of the
rational cognitive processing. Although Costello (2008)
made normative sense of the conjunction fallacy considering
combination of measurement error terms, the current study
proposed another explanation that can also rationalize the
conjunction fallacy in terms of the normative sense.
One crucial assumption of this study is that probabilities
for statements can be measured from the corpus data. Our
rational for this assumption is mainly based on the findings
in the previous studies that succeeded to explain human
reasoning by utilizing the corpus data (e. g., Sakamoto &
Nakagawa, 2007; Stewart, Chater, & Brown, 2006; Terai&
Nakagawa, 2007; Utsumi, 2010). This rationale strongly
depends on pragmatic arguments: that is, it solely states that
this assumption is valid because of its ability to predict the
data. Thus, this rationale does not appear to be strong
because it does not explain why the corpus can be utilized to
predict probability judgment. We believe that the current
study add another evidence for utility of the usage of corpus
data to investigate human reasoning. However, we must
clarify our rational more precisely to justify using the corpus
data for probability judgment.
