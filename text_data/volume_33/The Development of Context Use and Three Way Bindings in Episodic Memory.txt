events. For example, the episodic events that were
mentioned in the car parking examples could all be
transformed into a list learning paradigm. The first example
where one had to remember a single parking event could be
transformed into a condition called ABCD. The first two
letters ‘AB’ refer to the item pairs in the first list and ‘CD’
refers to the item pairs in the second list. As the letters in
‘AB’ and ‘CD’ do not overlap, the items in the first and
second list of the ABCD condition do not overlap (see
Figure 1). Therefore when asked to recall the event given a             Figure 1: An illustration of the presented stimuli and each

Procedure The experiment consists of two study phases
where participants studied six pairs of items respectively. A
3 to 4 minute retention interval followed each study phase,
which involved participants to play a simple and engaging
video game. Sequentially there were 6 cued recall tests. The
procedures were same for all groups except that the two
children group participated in their schools while adults
participated in the laboratory.
  A practice phase preceded the experiment to explain the
procedure to the participants. The procedure was identical to
the experiment except that the items were reduced to one
pair a list and did not have a retention interval. After the
practice phase, each participant was randomly assigned to
one of the experiment conditions.
  After participants understood the procedure through the
practice phase, they were told that they are going to visit a
cartoon character’s house. They were first introduced to the
character and then to the objects in the character’s house.                  Figure 3: An illustration of the study lists and test.
