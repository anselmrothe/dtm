         Exogenous and endogenous cueing
Before describing the experiments, we shall briefly summa-
rize previous findings on different types of (visual) cueing.
   It has previously been suggested that gaze-following is a
behavior that is applied so reliably that it may be consid-
ered automatic. Specifically, studies have shown that peo-
ple reflexively follow stylized gaze cues and other direction-

of stimuli were created, accounting for three conditions and
their counter-balanced versions. In addition to 24 items, 36
fillers were included such that a total of 60 trials was shown.
Fillers frequently contained false utterances to motivate the
validation task. The order of item trials was randomized for
each participant individually.
