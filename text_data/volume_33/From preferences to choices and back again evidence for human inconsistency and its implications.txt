Abstract: People’s choices can be predicted given information about their preferences. Learning people’s preferences
is the inverse problem of inferring preferences from choices. Given the apparent relationship between choice prediction
and preference learning, it is natural to ask whether the two are mutually consistent. Given weak assumptions, we
show that no single, consistent model of the relationship between choices and preferences can explain both the
choices people make and their inferences about others’ preferences. This finding implies that people make systematic
errors in learning about others’ preferences, and indicates that some accounts of preference learning, e.g., those
based on simulating choices as well as unconstrained rational models, are inadequate. We also consider alternative
assumptions, which allow consistent models but require a new interpretation of decoy effects in multiattribute choice.
