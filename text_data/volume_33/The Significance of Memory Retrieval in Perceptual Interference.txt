Abstract: Verbal overshadowing is a phenomenon where verbalizing a nonverbal experience produces an inaccurate
memory of the experience. Drawing from perceptual symbol systems, we postulate that verbal overshadowing
belongs to the larger phenomenon of perceptual interference. Verbalizing or mentally imaging nonverbal experiences
produces inaccurate memories of those experiences. This is because people initially form prototypical representations
of nonverbal experiences. These prototypical representations are not always identical to later exemplars of the
experience. On perceiving an exemplar and later having to remember it, people may retrieve inaccurate prototypical
representations instead. To test this, we developed a visual interference paradigm that uses fictional spy devices.
Previous experiments have shown that peopleâ€™s prototypical representations interfere with their memories for the
veridical exemplars, and that it occurs with verbalization or with mental imagery. The current experiment investigates
whether perceptual interference occurs during memory encoding, retrieval, or both. Results indicate that it may
occur during retrieval.
