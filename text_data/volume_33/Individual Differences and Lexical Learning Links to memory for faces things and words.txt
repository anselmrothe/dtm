Procedure
The testing session began with the assessments and the
exposure phases of the old/new tasks. This was followed by
the artificial lexicon experiment and then the test phases of
the old/new tasks.
   Participants were assigned randomly to the experimental
conditions. Participants were not informed about possible
correlations in the materials in either condition. They were
simply told to learn the names of the objects, in a 2-
alternative forced choice task.
   Phonological stimuli were presented auditorally, in the
form of instructions such as “Find pile.” Participants
responded by clicking on one of the mushrooms. Initially,
they just had to guess. If they clicked on the incorrect item,
