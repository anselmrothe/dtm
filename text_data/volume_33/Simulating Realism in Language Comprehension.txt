Method
Participants. Sixty-three Emory University undergraduates
participated for course credit. The data of 11 participants were
discarded because of high error rates (> 20%; N = 1) or long
mean response latencies (> 700 ms; N = 10).
Materials. The same sentences and pictures as in Experiment
1 were used. An additional 80 drawings of the same objects
(Rossion & Pourtois, 2004) were added to the set of pictures.
These drawings were augmented versions of Snodgrass and
Vanderwart’s (1980) original stimuli, with color information
and some texture detail added. While the new stimuli were
designed to appear more realistic than their line drawing              Figure 3: Response times to photographs, color drawings,
