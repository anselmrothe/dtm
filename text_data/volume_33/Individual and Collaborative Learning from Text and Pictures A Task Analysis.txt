Abstract: This study focused on the cognitive processes involved in learning from text and pictures, when learning
both individually and collaboratively. We designed a task in which learners actively engage with text and pictures in
a lesson about mitosis, followed by a test of knowledge gained from the task. During the task, think-aloud protocols
were collected. Preliminary results show that learners actively engage in cognitive processes that are thought to be
essential to learning from text and pictures: selecting, organizing, and integrating (Mayer, 2001). The verbal protocol
allows for a more detailed task analysis of these processes, as well as a correlational analysis between engagement in
these steps and test performance, to be presented at the conference. Furthermore, while individuals and collaborating
learners scored similarly on the knowledge test, their metacognitive strategies differed drastically. These results are
important in understanding how students learn from popular interactive media involving text and pictures.
