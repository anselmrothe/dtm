Human performance in complex tasks is often a
combination of internal planning and responding
appropriately to the environment. Nevertheless, cognitive
models of complex tasks typically focus on the mental
planning aspects, and fail to consider possible influence of
an external world on the control of behavior. The role of the
environment was first recognized in robotics (Brooks, 1991)
but was later extended to human cognition in the embodied
cognition approach (e.g., Clark, 1997; Kirsh & Maglio,
1994). The challenge is to understand how control is shared
between goal-driven planning and processes that are driven
by perceptual input. The approach we will take is to assume
two parallel processes: a bottom-up visual process that scans
the visual field on the basis of saliency and similarity, and a
top-down planning process that tries to achieve the goal, but
also biases the bottom-up process.                                    Figure 1: An example array of 12 cards. The cards with the
