Abstract: Bilinguals must be sensitive to context cues in order to access the right language system for that moment.
Consistent with this idea, a growing body of research suggests that bilinguals more effectively switch attention,
following changing cues, in executive control tasks. The present study used a context-cued pattern perception task
to more directly assess whether adult bilinguals are more sensitive to context than monolinguals, even in nonverbal contexts. If bilinguals attend to contextual information more efficiently than monolinguals, then they should
recognize patterns faster when presented in the same context (attention to relevant cues facilitates recognition) and
also when presented in different contexts (inhibition of irrelevant cues facilitates recognition). The results show that
this is the case, suggesting that bilingualism enhances a context awareness that results in refined inhibition skills, a
finding consistent with current research, and enhanced attention to relevant cues, a result not previously discussed
in bilingualism research.
