On modes and waves. The impact of learning modes on foreign
language representation and processing .
Martin G. DoÌˆpel
Lecturer
Abstract: In foreign language acquisition research, two variables are well-investigated: Age of Acquisition (AOA)
and Proficiency Level (PL) (e.g. Hahne, 2001; Wartenburger et al., 2003). The impact of different learning modes
was not investigated yet, although Osterhout and colleagues reported changes in the brain resulting from foreign
language learning recently (Osterhout et al., 2006, in press).
Two groups of students were asked to learn a certain grammar feature of German in two distinct modes. After
this instruction period, the participants had to participate in a grammaticality judgment experiment while an EEG
was recorded. The EEG was then analyzed for event-related potentials.
