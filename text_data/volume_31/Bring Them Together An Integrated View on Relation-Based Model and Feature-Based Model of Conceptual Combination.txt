Abstract: There are largely two different views on the process of conceptual combination; relation-based view
and feature-based view. Recently, there is a rising consensus that these two apparently distinct views need to
be integrated. If conceptual combination is one of the core cognitive processes by which human can extend their
knowledge, it is appropriate to assume that there is no restriction in using various aspects, types, or contents of
knowledge to combine concepts and the two different views can be seen as two different strategies or processes which
are provoked by accessing different aspects of knowledge; relational knowledge for relation-based strategy and internal
knowledge of concepts for feature-based strategy. In order to verify this assumption, we performed an experiment and
the overall results of the experiment showed that the difference of strategies which is involved to interpret compound
words results in the difference of interpretation patterns between experimental conditions.
