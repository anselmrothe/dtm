Abstract: The Chinese phonetic-to-sound mapping has a variety of types according to the dimensions of consistency
and homophony based on the lexical knowledge and sub-lexical information of the phonetic radical. Many previous
studies focused on the sub-lexical information based the comparison across the dimension of consistency. The current
simulation attempted to address these effects in consideration of both the dimensions of phonetic-sound mapping.
A feedforward neural was used to simulate the frequency effect and regularity effect. These findings reveal the
importance of investigating the homophony of phonetic-sound mapping to build a theoretical framework capable
of accounting for the lexical knowledge and sub-lexical information of the phonetic radicals in Chinese reading
processing.
