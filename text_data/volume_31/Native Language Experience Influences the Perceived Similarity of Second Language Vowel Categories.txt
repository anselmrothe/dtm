the influence of confusability on the dynamics of response
execution itself. Although individual saccadic eye
movements can occasionally show some curvature (Doyle &
Walker, 2001), individual movements of the arm and hand
can show quite dramatic curvature (Tipper, Howard, &
Jackson, 1997) that can be interpreted as the dynamic
blending of two mutually exclusive motor commands (Cisek
& Kalaska, 2005). Additionally, whereas eye-movement
data allow for approximately 2-3 data points (saccades) per
second, mouse-tracking yields somewhere between 30 and
60 data points per second. In light of the ability to record
many data points per second, along with their ability to
