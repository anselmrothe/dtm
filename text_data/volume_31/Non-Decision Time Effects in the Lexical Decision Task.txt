accomplished by allowing only drift rate to vary between
word frequency conditions. This is common practice when
applying the diffusion model. Differences in non-decision
process parameters cannot be the sole account for word
frequency effects, as these processes cannot influence error
rates. However, although less parsimonious, there is no
reason why non-decision processes might not be affected by
word frequency in addition to drift rates. Indeed, Ratcliff et
al.’s (2004) application of the diffusion model to the LDT

variability was used, with most earlier applications
