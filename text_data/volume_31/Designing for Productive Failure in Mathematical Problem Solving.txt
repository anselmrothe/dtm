problems for practice. The teacher then discussed the
solutions with the class. For homework, students were asked
to continue with the workbook problems. This cycle of
lecture, practice/homework, and feedback then repeated
itself over the course of seven periods. Note that the
worked-out examples and practice problems were typically
well-structured problems with fully-specified parameters,
prescriptive representations, predictive sets of solution
strategies and solution paths, often leading to a single
correct answer. Students worked independently most of the
time although some problems were solved collaboratively.
   In short, the LP condition represented a design that was
highly structured from the very beginning with the teacher
leading the students through a set of well-structured
problems with proximal feedback and regular practice. The
PF condition represented a design that delayed structure (in
the form of the consolidation lecture) up until students had
