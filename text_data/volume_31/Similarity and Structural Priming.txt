construction and prime-target verb identity is statistically sig-
nificant, a logistic regression model similar to that in Bresnan
et al. (2007) was used, with likelihood of PO being the posi-
tive response. Specifically, a mixed logit model3 was used in
both studies in order to control for a random effect of speaker
(in other words, each speaker is allowed to have a differ-
ent rate of ditransitive choice). Mixed logit models can be
thought of as an extension of logistic regression that includes
modeling of random effects. Inclusion of random effects is
necessary to generalize beyond the speakers in the data sam-
ple. In this study, the random effect accounts for the fact that
speakers may have different rates of ditransitive use. Here and

variable and its levels of significance will be reported. Coeffi-

If the feature is categorical, the the difference between the two
exemplars is 0 if they have the same value for the feature, and
1 if they have different values for the feature. If the feature
is continuous, then the difference between the two exemplars
is just the difference in the values of feature i for the two
exemplars, divided by the maximum range of that feature (so
that features won’t be weighted too highly just because they
involve larger numbers).
