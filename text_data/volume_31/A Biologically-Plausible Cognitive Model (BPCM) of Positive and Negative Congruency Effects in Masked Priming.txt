stimuli is imp lemented with a localized representation, for
example, the left unit is turned on when the stimulus is less
than five in the case of numerals and symbols, or points left
in the case of arrows; otherwise the right unit is turned on.
Accordingly, as will be described belo w, in a congruent trial
the two corresponding units (e.g., the left unit of the prime
and target in IL) is set to 1 or 0 at the time of stimulus
presentation, while in an incongruent trial, one of the two
relevant units of the prime or target is set to 1 and the other
to 0.
   The units in each layer make connections, via excitatory
weights, to their corresponding units in other layers. The
activations of these units (except IL) are calculated by a
sigmoid (logistic) function of the incoming informat ion, and
a small amount of random noise. The RL sends excitatory
activities to ML and CL continuously but activates AA only
if a unit of the prime or target reaches a designated threshold
of .62. Similarly, when one of the two units in the ML
reaches the same designated threshold it triggers a manual
response (i.e., init iating a hand movement). When AA is
activated and its activation reaches a threshold, it starts

making the activation function of their units steeper.                   Figure 1: The architecture of the model. The IL projects

modulates other layers when g crosses a threshold, 1. Its
activity modes can be phasic or tonic depending on the
conflict state, low or high, respectively. In all conditions the
CL can change the AA mode according to the conflict
between prime and target (i.e., using within-trial conflict).
The phasic and tonic modes of AA responses are
implemented using high or low c value (3 or 1) (see
equation 5). The c value is 3 at the beginning of each trial
(for the prime), but it is set to 1 (for the target) if conflict
occurs. The number of computer simulat ion cycles from the
target onset until one of the M L units reached a designated
threshold, .62, was considered as RT. A constant, as other
sensory and motor processes, could be added to this RT, to
increase the match between simulation and human data.
                      Simulati on Results
Simulation 1: mask-target SOA. To simulate the data from
previous studies i.e., a PCE and an NCE with short and long
mask-target SOAs, respectively (e.g., Schlaghecken &
Eimer, 2000; Jaśkowski & Ślósarek, 2006) a simulation was
run with no changes in the parameters except the mask-
target SOA. Seven intervals of the mask-target SOA (fro m
71 to 251, with 30 cycles interval) were used to show the
effect of SOA on priming pattern. To maintain consistency,
the duration of the mask was again 71 cycles, but a longer
mask duration has a similar effect (as used in the following
simu lations).
