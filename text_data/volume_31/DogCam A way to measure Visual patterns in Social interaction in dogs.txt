Abstract: Modern technology, including lightweight cameras and eye tracking equipment now seem to afford the
possibility of tracking where an animals visual attention is directed in real time and with greater precision than
can be had by fixed cameras or third-party observers. The current hypothesis is that a dog-mounted camera can
provide a reliable source of precise information about the dogs moment-to-moment visual attention at a resolution
that exceeds other techniques for assessing gaze direction. In particular, we are interested in gaining precision at
scales of 10cm or less, and 500ms or less, which will allow us to say precisely where dogs look at when are engaged
in communicative signaling, such as during a stereotypical play bow or petting situation.
  With this new technology we will put some of the techniques that have been effective in generating knowledge
about human cognition to work in studying dog-dog and dog-human interaction.
