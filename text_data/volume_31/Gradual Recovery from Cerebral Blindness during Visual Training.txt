Abstract: Abstract: Several studies on recovery of hemianopsia after CVA report visual field enlargements after
stimulation of the visual field border area. However, it is not known how the visual field enlargement develops
as a function of time. We trained 11 subjects by stimulating their affected visual field. We assessed the border
location with Goldmann perimetry before, during and after training. To exclude eye-movements as a cause of
field enlargement, an eye-tracker was used during each complete perimetry session. We found that the visual field is
enlarging gradually during training in the direction of the blind area, despite the fact that we did not only stimulated
the shifting border area, but used a wide-ranged stimulus-set. Concluding, detection thresholds in stimulated areas
in the affected field only start to decrease when the shifting field-border reaches those areas, resulting in a gradual
visual field enlargement. Training effects can be generalized to important daily-life activities like reading.
