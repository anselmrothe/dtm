Abstract
The dual-route models of action imitation predict that,
normally, known actions are imitated by using a semantic
route - i.e. by activating a representation of the action from
memory - whereas unknown, new actions are reproduced by
using a direct route - i.e. by performing a visuo-motor
transformation of the input into an output. Here we aimed at
establishing the nature of the dominant process used by
healthy adult individuals in imitation. Participants performed
an imitation task with both predictable switches and
pseudorandom, unpredictable switches The predictable
switches are less cognitively demanding, and allow the
voluntary selection of the most suitable process for
performing the task; whereas the unpredictable switches are
more demanding and lead to a more intense use of strategies.
We observed significant switch costs only in the predictable
switch condition, when subjects had to rely on working
memory to keep track of the underlying sequence, but not in
the pseudorandom sequences, where participants could select
the direct route to decrease the cognitive effort. These
findings suggest that the semantic route is the dominant, more
automatic and less-demanding process for action imitation.
The strategic selection of route in action imitation and in
monitoring behaviour seems to be an adaptive acquisition.
Keywords: imitation, cognitive strategies, meaningful and
meaningless actions, switching cost.

Introduction
Since Meltzoff and Moore (1977; 1983; 1989) discovered
that infants can imitate facial expressions and hand gestures
within a few hours of life, it has been widely accepted that
imitation is an innate human ability. Many studies in both
the context of social psychology (e.g. Dijksterhuis & Bargh
2001; Lakin et al. 2003) and cognitive neuroscience (e.g.,
Brass et al. 2000; Brass et al., 2005; Lhermitte et al. 1986;
De Renzi et al. 1996) have suggested that imitation is a
contagious and automatic process. Brass and colleagues
(Brass et al. 2001; Brass et al. 2000), for example, showed
that movement observation influences movement execution

in a task in which the response is not related (i.e., a simple
stimulus-response compatibility paradigm with finger
movements), thus supporting an automatic tendency to
imitate also in adults. Some authors have also shown that
patients with frontal lesions suffer from imitation behaviour
(Lhermitte et al. 1986; De Renzi et al. 1996) and they
imitate the examiner’s movements even if instructed not to
do so. It has been proposed that the deficit is caused by a
lack of inhibition of the mediobasal frontal cortex on the
parietal lobe. This effect is not to a general effect that
involved overlearned skills but it is specific for inhibiting
actions (Brass Derrfuss and von Cramon, 2005).
In contrast, patients with ideomotor apraxia exhibit a
dramatic reduction of their ability to imitate actions, and
often to pantomime on verbal command and visually
presented objects (De Renzi et al. 1980), in particular after
lesions of the left inferior posterior parietal cortex (e.g.
Goldenberg and Hagmann 1997; Buxbaum et al. 2005;
Tessari et al. 2007).
Models of imitation
Many cognitive models have been put forward in order to
explain imitative behaviours in humans. They range along a
continuum. On the one end there is the direct matching
approach (Prinz 1997; Hommel, Müsseler, Aschrsleben and
Prinz 2001), stating that observing the effect of an action
facilitates its execution because perception and action
planning share a common representational code. In the
middle, the Active Intermodal Mapping (Meltzoff & Moore
1977; 1997), suggesting that imitation is a matching-totarget process, based on the proprioceptive feedback loop
that allows infants’ motor performance to be evaluated
against the perceived target. On the other end of the
continuum, there are theories that require more than a
simple process. One such theory is the goal-directed theory
(Bekkering, Wohlschläger and Gattis, 2000), according to
which imitation is decomposition-reconstruction process
dependent on sub-goals hierarchically organized (i.e. the
objects to which the actions are directed, the agents that
perform actions, or the movement) and on cognitive

2475

resources available (Wohlschläger et al. 2003). Another
such model is the one based on neuropsychological
observations of patients with selective deficits for imitation
of meaningless or meaningful actions (Goldenberg and
Hagmann 1997; Peigneux et al. 2000; Bartolo et al. 2001;
Tessari et al., 2007). According to this model, there are two
processes for imitation: a direct route for reproducing novel
actions (but also those already known) that can parse seen
actions in subcomponents that the person is already able to
perform, and a semantic, indirect route for reproducing only
over-learned actions, that are already stored in long-term
memory. Some of these models also include a specific
temporary memory structure, common to both processes, for
holding the gestures in memory until they are reproduced
(Cubelli et al., 2000, who call it “buffer”; Rumiati &
Tessari, 2002; Buxbaum, 2001). This short-term/working
memory subsystem is also connected to the long-term
memory system and allows us to learn new actions (Tessari
et al., 2006). Other authors introduced in this scheme also a
supramodal representation of the body, based on the
observations of patients who failed to reproduce postures
not only by themselves but also on a manikin (Goldenberg
& Hagmann, 1997; but see also Buxbaum, 2001).
Some support to the existence of two separate processes is
provided also by some imaging studies that investigated the
cerebral correlates of the mechanisms involved in actual
imitation. A Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
performed by Peigneux et al.’s (2004) found that imitation
of familiar actions was associated with activations in the left
angular and middle frontal gyri, the right supramarginal
gyrus and inferior parietal lobule; whereas imitation of
novel, meaningless actions was associated with inferior and
superior parietal lobes bilaterally. Rumiati et al. (2005)
required participants to imitated meaningful and
meaningless actions in a PET study using a parametric
design. A significant positive correlation with the amount of
meaningful actions was found in the left inferior temporal
gyrus, and a significant positive correlation with the amount
of meaningless movements was observed in the right
parieto-occipital junction. Moreover, direct categorical
comparisons showed increased neural activity in the left
inferior temporal gyrus, the left parahippocampal gyrus, and
the left angular gyrus when imitating meaningful relative to
meaningless actions. In contrast, imitation of meaningless
(relative to meaningful actions) revealed increased neural
activity in the superior parietal cortex bilaterally, in the right
parieto-occipital junction, in the right occipital-temporal
junction, and in the left superior temporal gyrus. Similar
areas were found to be damaged in a neuropsychological
study (Tessari et al., 2007). In particular, the brain structures
damaged in left-brain damage patients who are able to
imitate meaningful actions better than meaningless actions
overlapped in the superior temporal lobe and the ventral
portion of the angular gyrus; and those lesioned in the rightbrain damage patients overlapped in the basal ganglia. On
the other hand, the patients who imitated meaningless better
than meaningful actions had lesions involving the lateral

and dorsal portion of the hippocampus, extending to the
bordering white matter, and the dorsal angular gyrus.
Does the cognitive system strategically switch between
the two processes? Evidence form healthy individual and
brain-damaged patients
Results with both healthy subjects (Tessari & Rumiati,
2004) and brain damaged patients (Tessari et al., 2007)
demonstrated that the composition of the list of the to-be
imitated actions, that is the percentage of meaningful and
meaningless actions, induces a strategic use of the two
routes when limited cognitive resources are available. In a
previous study (Tessari and Rumiati 2004) we tested healthy
individuals with a deadline technique, consisting of a fast
presentation of the stimulus and a very limited time for the
response. This paradigm temporally reduced the cognitive
resources available for performing the task. They found that
when meaningful and meaningless actions were presented in
a mixed list, then subjects selected the direct route for
reproducing both types of action in order to avoid the effort
of switching routes. However, when meaningful and
meaningless actions were presented in separate lists a
dissociation of the routes was observed: the direct route is
used for imitating meaningless actions and the semantic
route is used for the meaningful actions, inducing to a better
imitative performance on the latter kind of actions. Similar
results were observed in a study with brain-damaged
patients, whose cognitive resources are reduced by the brain
lesion (Tessari et al., 2007). Both left- and right-brain
damage were required to imitate the meaningful and
meaningless actions which presented either in separated
blocks or intermingled. At a group level, patients performed
better in the blocked than in the mixed condition,
irrespective of the side of the lesion. Moreover, at a singlecase level, a classical double dissociation in imitation of
meaningful and meaningless actions was evidenced in two
patients (cases 19 and 31). This double dissociation supports
a functional independency of the two routes.

Which is the dominant process?
Some studies suggest that the direct route might be
dominant in children (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977; 1997).
However, this mechanism might loose its importance as the
child becomes an adult equipped with a large vocabulary of
actions. Therefore, it is plausible that, once a large
repertoire of actions is acquired, the direct route is inhibited
and imitation performance relies mainly on the semantic
route (Brass et al., 2001; Lhermitte, 1983; Lhermitte et al.,
1986). In the present study we aimed at assessing this
hypothesis. To establish which of the two processes is the
dominant one in healthy individuals, we employed a
switching paradigm in an action imitation task (Allport &
Wylie, 1999; Meuter & Allport, 1998). The task-switching
paradigm is commonly used to investigate processes of
cognitive flexibility and adjustments in the cognitive
system. (see Rogers & Monsell, 1995; Monsell, 2003 for a

2476

review). On this paradigm, subjects perform at least two
different cognitive tasks, each of which can be either
indicated by a cue or derived from a fixed sequence (i.e.,
AABBAA). Studies that made used of this paradigm
constantly showed costs when switching from one task to
another relative to when the same task is repeated. This cost
is attributed to the application of a new task set and the
persisting activation of the recently performed one
(Monsell, 2003).
This paradigm is thus suitable for establishing whether the
two imitative routes can be easily switched and which of the
two is dominant. The switching paradigm might further
reveal whether the selection of one route over the other is
driven only by bottom-up factors, i.e. the list composition
(see Tessari & Rumiati, 2004) or whether top-down
selection also takes place.
In this study we investigated the role of the composition
of the list (context) in strategy selection in healthy
individual. A group of participants was presented with a)
fixed sequences of meaningful and meaningless actions and,
therefore predictable switches, which forced subjects to
monitor the sequence; b) random switches that occurred
after three, five or seven trials of meaningful or meaningless
actions. This was thought to reveal the influence of bottomup factor such as list composition on the selection between
the two routes for imitation.

Experiment 1
Predictable switches
In this experiment we aimed at reproducing a condition in
which the cognitive system can predict and guide the
selection of the most suitable process for action imitation:
fixed sequences of meaningful and meaningless actions
were shown and predictable switches (every 5 trials) were
used.

meaninglessness of the actions from this original set; those
actions that received the best average scores on a scale from
1 (minimum) up to 5 (maximum) from the five raters were
selected and then employed as experimental stimuli.
Design and procedure. Both meaningful and the
meaningless actions were presented in a random order, five
times each in a single block. The sequence of events was
structured as follows: Each trial started with an action that
lasted for 1264 ms, followed by a 1000 ms blank interval, at
the end of which a beep was played for 250 ms (see Figure
1). Participants were required to imitate each action
immediately after its presentation (i.e., during the blank
interval); the next trial appeared immediately after. In the
“fixed” condition, alternated sequences of 5 meaningful and
5 meaningless actions were presented. All 30 actions (15
meaningful and 15 meaningless) were presented randomly
in 5 subsequent sub blocks for a total amount of 150 trials.
The participants were informed about the composition of the
list (i.e., fixed sequences or random sequences), and they
were asked to imitate the actions with their right limb. The
actor performed the actions with his left limb. Participants’
performance was videotaped and later scored independently
by two naïve raters (As there was no significant difference
between the scores of the two raters in both experiments: all
p < 0.05, an analysis on the mean scores is used in the
results section). An imitated action was scored as incorrect
when one of the following errors occurred: Spatial error of
the hand, spatial error of the arm, semantic errors (i.e.
prototypicalization, body part as a tool), visual (i.e. partial
perseveration,
global
perseveration,
lexicalization),
omission, and unrecognizable gestures (see Tessari &
Rumiati, 2004, for a detailed description).

Method
Participants. Nineteen right-handed individuals, all
students of the University of Bologna (9 males, average
age=22.84, SD=1.98) participated in the experiment. They
all had either normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Their
handedness was tested using the Edinburgh Inventory
(Oldfield, 1971).
Stimuli. We used 15 familiar, meaningful actions
(pantomimes of object use; i.e. to iron, to pour with a bottle,
to screw a light bulb, to write with a pen, to use a
toothbrush,) and 15 novel meaningless actions (obtained by
modifying the relationship between hand/arm and trunk in
the meaningful actions). They were chosen from an original
set of 20 meaningful and 20 meaningless actions used in
previous studies (Tessari & Rumiati, 2004; Rumiati et al.,
2005; Tessari et al., 2006; Tessari et al., 2007): Five
independent individuals rated the meaningfulness and

Results. A repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed only on the first and second
trials, with Type of Action (meaningful vs. meaningless)
and Order (first vs. second trial; this difference represent the
switching costs) as within-subject factors, and imitation
accuracy as dependent variable. Both Type of Action

(F(1,18)=0.07, p>.05) and Order (F(1,18)=0.15, p>.05) were
not significant but their interaction was (F(1,18)=5.37,
p<.05): a switching cost was found for the meaningful
actions, with accuracy being lower for the first
(mean=11.89, SD=1.45) than for the second (mean=12.37,
SD=1.77) trial (paired-samples t-test: t(18)=1.84, p<.05).
On the other hand, an opposite pattern emerged for the
meaningless actions: accuracy on the first was better than on
the second trial (mean=12.37, SD=1.89 and mean=11.74,
SD=1.56, respectively; paired-samples t-test: t(18)=1.75,
p<.05).

Method
Participants. Twenty right-handed individuals, all students
of the University of Bologna (11 males, average age=23,
S.D.=2.22) participated in the experiment. They all had
either normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Their
handedness was tested using the Edinburgh Inventory
(Oldfield, 1971).
Stimuli. We used the same stimuli as in Experiment 1.

Discussion. A significant switching cost (i.e. the average
mean on a switch trial minus that on a repeat trial) emerged
when imitating meaningful actions but not meaningless
ones. According to Allport et al. (1994), the switch effect is
greater when switching from a more difficult task to an
easier one. Therefore, this cost seems to suggest that the
semantic route, used for reproducing meaningful actions, is
the most automatic process in adult individuals and need
greater inhibition when switching to the direct route, that is
necessary for imitating the meaningless actions. This was
also suggested by results from imitation under time limits:
despite the fact that when imitating without time constraints,
no difference emerges between meaningful and meaningless
action (see Experiment 1’s introduction in Tessari &
Rumiati, 2004), when time pressure is imposed and
predictable switches (i.e. blocked presentation) are used, the
human cognitive system is able to extract the regularity in
the presentation sequence and to predict the forthcoming
type of stimulus therefore applying the right process to
perform the imitation task.

Experiment 2
Unpredictable switches
In this experiment, pseudorandom switches between
meaningful and meaningless actions were used. This
condition reproduces the mixed condition in Tessari and
Rumiati (2004) where the direct route is usually preferred

Design and procedure. They were the same as in
Experiment 1 with respect to the trial structure, but
alternated sequences of randomly presented 3, 5 or 7
meaningful and 3, 5, 7 meaningless actions. This condition
should simulate the mixed presentation in Tessari and
Rumiati (2004). The participants were informed about the
composition of the list (i.e., fixed sequences or random
sequences), and they were asked to imitate the actions with
their right limb.
Results. A repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed only on the first and second
trials, with Type of Action (meaningful vs. meaningless)
and Order (first vs. second trial; this difference represent the
switching costs) as within-subject factors and imitation
accuracy as dependent variables. Both Type of Action,
Order and their interaction were not significant
(F(1,19)=1.31,
p>.05,
F(1,19)=0.17,

and
F(1,19)=1.79, p>.05, respectively). See figure 3.

meaningful trial was significantly lower in Experiment 1
than in Experiment 2 (mean=11.89 and mean=13.40
respectively).

Discussion. This experiment did not lead to any switching
costs, suggesting that when healthy individuals are
presented with unpredictable sequences of meaningful and
meaningless actions they tend to privilege the use of the
direct route for reproducing both types of actions as already
demonstrated in previous studies (Tessari & Rumiati, 2004;
Rumiati et al., 2005; Tessari et al., 2006; Tessari et al.,
2007).

Conclusion
When time constraints are imposed in a predictable
condition (i.e. the fixed list), where participants can apply
the most suitable process to perform the imitation task,
switching cost was obtained only when subjects switched to
meaningful actions and no switching cost was observed
when subjects had to switch to meaningless actions. This
might indicate the need to suppress the dominant, semantic
route when imitating meaningless actions (see Meuter &
Allport, 1998 for a similar argument in language switching).
Furthermore, we found no switch cost when switches were
unpredictable, that is in the mixed list. One plausible
explanation for this finding is that participants used the
direct route from the beginning and stick to it throughout the
experiment as already suggested by previous studies on both
normal individuals (Tessari & Rumiati, 2004) and braindamaged patients (Tessari et al., 2007).
We conclude that the semantic route seems to be the
dominant process in adult individuals, and that the
modulation of the two cognitive processes seems to be
modulated in a bottom-up fashion being influenced by the
composition of the list.
