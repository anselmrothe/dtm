Procedure In all tasks discussed here, participants were
presented with a random order of the 37 individual colors on
a neutral gray background. Each color remained on the
screen until a task-dependent rating was made along a 14
cm (400 px) line. The next trial began 500ms later. For the
color preference task, participants rated how much they
liked each color on a scale from “not at all” at the left end of
the line to “very much” at the right end. For the
colorimetric task participants rated how red vs. green,
yellow vs. blue, light vs. dark, and saturated vs. desaturated
each color appeared to be. Trials were blocked by
colorimetric dimension.

Procedure In the object-description phase, participants
were presented with each of the 37 colors on a computer
screen as a square on a neutral gray background, one at a
time in a random order. Each color remained on the screen
for 20 seconds, during which participants wrote verbal
descriptions of as many “things” as they could that they
associated with that particular color. Participants were
instructed to name objects whose color would be generally
known (e.g., not the color of some particular music album)
and not to name objects that could be any arbitrary color
(e.g., T-shirts, crayons, or paint).
   All of the 4744 object descriptions were filtered by the
