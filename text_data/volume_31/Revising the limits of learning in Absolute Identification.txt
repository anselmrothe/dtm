unidimensional stimuli. Here, we propose an integrative
hypothesis that draws these effects together, and reconciles
our findings with previous research.
   Figure 3 demonstrates the relationship between initial
performance and overall improvement. Higher initial
performance is associated with greater improvement in
information transfer (r(16)= 0.57, p=0.013) across all
experiments. This pattern also appears in Rouder et al.’s
(2004) Experiment 3, where participants demonstrated
significant learning with 30 lines of varying length when
given moderate practice. Rouder et al. noted that learning
