an absolute question. The comparative question asked
participants if they agreed or disagreed with a given anchor,
e.g.: The Pontiac Solstice can reach a top speed of 226
MPH: Agree / Disagree. Following, if they disagreed, they
were asked to provide their absolute estimate. This phrasing
of the first question was used because in contrast to the
phrasing used in prior works (which asks whether the actual
number is higher or lower than the given anchor), there is no
pragmatic implication that the suggested value is necessarily
wrong. In addition, we constructed two variations of this
question where we prefaced it with the clause It is true
that… and It is false that… (e.g., It is true that the Pontiac
Solstice can reach a top speed of 226 MPH). This framing
