Abstract: Anthropomorphic explanations can be observed in formal academic settings as well as everyday dis-
cussions. The fact that people endow human characteristics to inanimate phenomena has been observed in a wide
variety of disciplines. Unfortunately, the theoretical interest in this phenomenon has not translated into an extensive
empirical literature. Those studies that have been conducted (e.g., Tamir & Zohar, 1991
                                                           3186
