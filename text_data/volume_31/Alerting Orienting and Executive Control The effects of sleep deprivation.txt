Abstract

Wesensten, 2006; Nilsson et al., 2005). For instance,
neuropsychological test, such as word fluency tasks
(Harrison et al., 2000), and the “Stroop task” (Lingenfelser
et al., 1994; McCarthy & Waters, 1997), are sensitive to one
or two nights of sleep deprivation, as well as both error
detection and error remedial actions (Tsai et al., 2005),
detection of novelty (Gosselin, De Koninck, Campbell,
2005), or shifting between simple cognitive tasks (Heuer et
al., 2004) are impaired by TSD. Equally, decision making
under conditions of uncertainty, may be particularly
vulnerable to sleep loss (Killgore, Balkin, Wesensten,
2006). Specifically, sleep deprived subjects take more risk
than they ordinarily would when they were considering a
gain, but less risk than they ordinarily would when they
were considering a loss (Mckenna et al., 2007). In summary,
TSD appears to particularly compromise cognitive
functioning mediated by the frontal lobes.
Within the functions that suffer from one night of total
sleep deprivation one of the most prominent seems to be
attention; in fact it is usually recognized that performance
decrements after sleep loss are mainly due to attentional
deficits (Dinges, 1992), an explanation that consider
attention like an unitary construct. On the contrary,
cognitive researchers agree upon the idea that attention is a
multidimensional ability (Fan, Raz, Posner, 2002; Posner &
Petersen, 1990), that it is possible to consider concretely as
an organ system (Posner & Raz, 2004). This system
involves almost three specialized neural networks and
neuromodulators, subserving different attentional functions:
1) Alerting, defined as achieving (phasic alerting) and
maintaining (tonic alerting or vigilance) a general state of
activation of the cognitive system. 2) Orienting, that
selectively allocates the attentional focus to a potentially
relevant area of the visual field; 3) Executive Control –i.e.,
the ability to control our own behaviour in order to achieve
intended goals and resolving conflict among alternative
responses.
It is well-known that TSD affects the alerting system, as
reflected by reaction time tasks (Urrila et al., 2007; Van den
Berg & Neely, 2006). However, due to many inconsistent
results, effects of sleep loss on both orienting and executive

Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter attentional functions,
like sustaining an alert state over a period of time (vigilance or
tonic alerting). However, the effects of sleep loss on both orienting
and executive control are not still clear, and no study has assessed
whether sleep deprivation might affect the relation among these
three attentional abilities. In this study we used the Attentional
Network Test (ANT) in order to investigate the efficiency of the
three networks: alerting, orienting and executive control. Eighteen
right-handed male subjects participated to the experiment, which
took place on two consecutive days. On the first day, in order to
evaluate baseline condition, the subjects performed the ANT; on
the second day, during 24 h of sleep loss, the same task was
performed two times, at 5.00 p.m and at 4.00 a.m. Results showed
an overall slowing of reaction time in the nocturnal session,
indicating a decrease of vigilance. The orienting network
influenced the executive function network in a positive way (the
flanker effect was smaller for spatial cue than for the other type of
cues). However, results did not confirm an effect of sleep
deprivation on both executive control and orienting systems,
suggesting the independence between the tonic component of the
alerting and the other two attentional systems.

Introduction
The behavioural and cognitive effects of total sleep
deprivation (TSD) are well-known (Hill, 2004). TSD
increases sleepiness and affects performance on cognitive
tasks (e.g, Sagaspe et al., 2006). These aspects are very
relevant for understanding the consequences of sleep loss as
the cognitive demands of work increase, and night work
becomes more frequent.
Performance deficits can occur during the first night
without sleep, and are amplified after two nights (e.g.,
Horne & Pettit, 1985; Monk & Carrier, 1997). Concerning
higher cognitive functions, executive tasks are likely to be
sensitive to TSD, such as planning, decision making,
judgment, reasoning, speech and divergent thinking
(Harrison, Horne, Rothwell, 2000; Killgore, Balkin,

control are not still clear. Regarding orienting, few studies
have addressed this issue using a Covert Attention Task
(Posner, 1980). In this task, spatial orienting can be
manipulated by presenting a spatial cue, which comes
before target presentation, and can be either valid or invalid
with regard to the target location. A valid cue indicates the
location of the target, while in the invalid cue condition, the
target appears in a position not indicated by the cue.
Generally, reaction times (RT) in the valid condition are
more rapid than RT in the invalid condition; this effect is
known as attentional orienting effect.
Studies evaluating the relation between the decrease of
vigilance and orienting have lead to contrasting results
(Casagrande et al., 2006; Fimm, Willmes, Spijkers, 2006;
Versace et al., 2006). Specifically, Casagrande and coworkers (2006) found a general decrease in arousal (a
significant increase in RT) across 24 h of sustained
wakefulness, but not a selective effect on the orienting
mechanisms. On the contrary, Versace at al. (2006), using a
partial sleep reduction paradigm, observed a significant
slowing down of RT in the reorienting mechanism (invalid
condition). A similar interaction between alerting and
orienting was found by Fimm et al. (2006); in their study,
subjects performed a covert attention task every four hours,
during a 28 hours period of prolonged wakefulness; their
results indicate a significant increase of RT for invalid trials
only in the left visual field. One of the most relevant
differences among these studies concerns the type of
manipulation used to measure the orienting process; in fact,
an interaction between the two systems was observed in the
two studies (Fimm et al., 2006; Versace et al., 2006) that
used a peripheral predictive cue, but it was not found by
Casagrande et al. (2006), who used a central cue; in other
words, orienting and alerting networks seems to interacts
when the subject has to perform a task activating especially
bottom-up components of attention. This agrees with the
finding showing an increased orienting effect under phasic
alerteness, when peripheral non-predictive cues are used
(Callejas et al., 2004; 2005).
In relation to the executive control system, although many
studies found TSD impairs executive functions (Gosselin et
al., 2005; Harrison et al., 2000; Heuer et al., 2004; Killgore
et al., 2006; Lingenfelser et al, 1994; McCarthy & Waters,
1997; Mckenna et al., 2007; Nilsson et al., 2005; Tsai et al.,
2005), other studies do not confirm any impact of TSD on
executive control. For instance, Binks, Waters and Hurry
(1999) showed that short-term sleep deprivation have no
effects on a Stroop task, a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and
a word fluency task. In agreement with these results are
those found by Fallone, Acebo, Arnedt, Seifer and
Carskadon (2001), who did not observe an impaired
performance in inhibition tasks following sleep reduction.
Equally, Sagaspe et al. (2003) found no effects of 36 h of
sleep loss in a short task requiring random letters
generation.
Based on these contrasting data, it seems needed to evaluate
the effects of a moderate sleep deprivation on the attentional

networks, utilizing a single task that manipulate at the same
time alerting, orienting and executive control. To this
purpose, we have chosen a task developed by Fan et al.
(2002), named Attention Network Test (ANT). This task
results by a combination between a covert attention task
(Posner, 1980) and a flanker task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974).
Visual stimuli are used to separately assess alerting
(improved performance following a warning non spatial
cue), orienting (an additional benefit when the cue correctly
indicate the target location), and executive control functions
(impaired performance when the target contains conflicting
information).
The ANT was used for several reasons: 1) It is a brief (20
minutes) and simple task. This factor is remarkable
considering the non-univocal results about the impact of
sleep deprivation on the executive functions (Harrison et al.,
2000; Sagaspe et al., 2003). Particularly, the question could
be the following: does the impairment of the executive
system depends from a larger sleep deprivation (i.e., longer
than 24 hours and, therefore, implying a stronger reduction
of alertness), or from the use of longer and complex tasks,
which does it should selectively act on the executive
system? If these are the determining elements, we might
suggest for an efficient executive control in the ANT during
24 hs of continuous wakefulness.
2) The ANT allows appraising the relationship between
the attentional systems (independence/interaction). The
independence was confirmed for adult subjects (Fan et al.,
2002) and children 7 years old (Rueda et al., 2004).
Although an interaction between the executive and the other
networks seems to be well established, the interaction
between alerting and orienting is not valuable in the ANT,
cause the type of cues presented that did not allow an
independent measure of two systems. In fact, it has been
observed (Callejas, 2004; 2005; Fuentes & Campoy, 2008)
that when alerting is increased by introducing a warning
stimulus, the orienting and alerting systems interact.
Accordingly, a paradigm of sleep deprivation can be
interesting, not only to verify its effects on the attentional
functions, but also to appraise the relationship between
orienting and alerting, when this last is manipulated in an
independent way. In this case, at variance with other studies
(Callejas, 2004; 2005; Fuentes & Campoy, 2008), we have
manipulated tonic, and not phasic alerting.
METHODS
Subjects
Eighteen males (mean age: 23 ± 2.6) signed an informed
consent before participating as volunteers in the study. The
study was approved by the local ethical committee. They
were all naïve to the purpose of the experiment and all of
them reported normal or corrected to normal vision. During
the experimental session, subjects did not drink or eat
anything containing caffeine and similar (e.g., tea,
chocolate).
Apparatus, Stimuli and Procedure
2

774

Stimuli were programmed and presented via software EPrime on a Pentium 4 computer, presenting to a 21-inch
colour VGA monitor. Responses were collected through the
keyboard of the computer.
For an extensive and detailed description of both stimuli
and procedure see Fan et al. (2002) study. Stimuli consisted
of a row of five horizontal black lines, with arrowheads
pointing leftward or rightward presented on a grey
background. The target was a left- or right-point arrow at
the centre, which was flanked on either side by two arrows
pointing either in the same direction (congruent trials), or in
the opposite direction (incongruent trials), or by lines
(neutral trials). A single arrow or line subtended 0.558° of
visual angle. The target and flankers were presented 1.06˚
above or below the fixation point. The participants’ task
was to identify the direction of the centrally presented arrow
by pressing a button with the index finger of the right hand
for the right direction and another button for the left
direction. Target buttons were counter-balanced between
subjects.
Each trial consisted of these events: a fixation period of
variable duration (400 – 1600 msec), a cue presented for 100
msec, and the target display, which was presented 400 msec
after the cue. The target and flankers were presented until the
subject responded or until 1700 msec. Each trial lasted for
4000 msec. The fixation point appeared at the center of the
screen during the whole trial. While congruency between
target and distracting arrows’ direction was used to measure
the executive control network; four cue conditions were used
to measure efficiency of alerting and orienting networks: no
cue (baseline), center cue (cue at fixation), double cue (one
cue at each of the two possible target position), and spatial
cue (a cue 100% predictive of the target location). After a 24
trial practice block, subjects performed three experimental
blocks. Each one consisted of 96 trials.

RESULTS
All RT less than 100 ms or longer than 1400 ms were
excluded. These represented 0.34% of trials. The error rate
was 2.30% of the trials.
The ANOVA performed on mean RT showed a
significant effect for Session (F1,16=27.91; p<.0001), with
higher RT in the S-DEP session (Mean RT: 565.67 ms), as
compared to BSL (Mean RT: 506.18 ms). The main effect
of Cue (F3,48=51.48; p<.00001) was also significant and
post hoc analysis revealed faster RT in the spatial cue
(Mean RT: 500.38 ms), as compared to either no-cue (Mean
RT: 571.49 ms; p<.00005), double cue (Mean RT: 532.31
ms; p<.0001), and central cue trials (Mean RT: 539.52 ms;
p<.0001); further, RT were faster in both double cue
(p<.0001) and central cue trials (p<.0001) than in no-cue
trials. The main effect of Flanker (F2,32=129.57;
p<.0000001) was significant and the Duncan test showed
slower RT for incongruent trials (Mean RT: 591.61 ms) as
respect to both congruent (Mean RT: 508.91 ms; p<.0001)
and neutral trials (Mean RT: 507.25 ms; p<.0001). No
difference was found between congruent and neutral trials
(p= .78). The Cue x Flanker interaction was also significant
(F6,96=21.41; p<.00001; Figure 1), and post hoc analysis
showed a significant congruency effect for each type of cue
(all ps<.0001); higher RT in no-cue trials compared to all
the other cue types (p<.0001) were observed for the
congruent condition. In the incongruent condition, rapid RT
were present in spatial cue trials as respect to all the other
cue types (p<.001). In the condition with neutral flankers,
longer RT were present in the no-cue trials compared all the
other types of cue (p<.00002); while, no difference in RT
were found among spatial, central and double cue
conditions (p= 20). The ANOVA did not show any other
interaction: Session by Cue (F<1), Session by Flanker
(F2,32=2.71; p=.08) and Sessi on by Cue b y Flanker
(F6,96=1.54; p=.20).

General Procedure
The experiments were run on two consecutive days. On
the first day participants came individually to the laboratory
during the morning and they performed the task, for
training. On the second day, after subjects slept their usual 8
hrs, they were kept awake for 24 hours. The task was
performed at 5.00 p.m. (Baseline: BSL) and at 4.00 a.m.
(Sleep Deprivation: S-DEP).

and congruency effects, separately. For post hoc analysis of
the means, the Duncan test was used.

Experiment Design
The following dependent variables were considered: the
mean RT, the validity effect (central cue RT - spatial cue
RT), the alerting effect (no-cue RT - double cue RT), and
the congruency effect (incongruent trials RT - congruent
trials RT). On mean RT, a Session (BSL, S-DEP) x Cue
(Spatial, Central, Double, No-cue) x Flanker (Congruent,
Incongruent, Neutral) repeated measures ANOVA was
performed. For evaluating the efficiency of the attentional
systems, an one-way ANOVA considering the factor

the most relevant differences among these studies concerns
the type of manipulation applied to the orienting process; in
fact, an interaction between the two systems was observed
in both studies (Fimm et al., 2006; Versace et al., 2006;)
that used a peripheral predictive cue, but it was not found by
Casagrande et al. (2006), who used a central cue; in other
words, the attentional systems apparently require an
interaction between orienting and alerting when the subject
has to perform a task activating bottom-up components of
attention. In order to systematically analyze the interaction
between alerting and orienting, a recent study (Casagrande
& Martella, 2008) considered both the role of the employed
cue and the intensity of the induced decrease of alertness. In
this study, three different Covert Orienting tasks
respectively using a highly informative peripheral cue or
two different type of central cue (a digit vs. an arrow) were
administered under a TSD paradigm within two temporal
windows characterized by different levels of vigilance.
Results revealed that another variable appears to affect the
interaction between alerting and orienting, this is the
intensity of alertness. In fact, the interaction between the
two attentional systems was effective only when a mild
decrease of vigilance was induced by sleep deprivation,
while alerting and orienting resulted independent when both
a high or a very low level of vigilance was considered. This
relation, not considered by previous studies (Casagrande et
al., 2006, Fimm et al., 2006; Versace et al., 2006), could
account for the independence between alerting and orienting
founding in this study, in which sleep deprivation session
was characterized by a strong decrease of vigilance.
In line with other studies (Binks et al., 1999; Fallone et al.,
2001; Sagaspe et al., 2003; 2006), results did not confirm an
effect of sleep deprivation on the executive control system.
In this case, is very hard to suggest an explanation able to
account for the different results observed by many authors.
In fact, many executive functions are found to be sensitive
to sleep loss (i.e., Gosselin et al., 2005; McKenna et al.,
2007; Nilsson et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 2005), but other
studies did not confirm any effect (Binks et al., 1999;
Fallone et al., 2001; Sagaspe et al. 2003).
One could suggest that in order to observe a significant
impairment of executive functions, a stronger decrease of
vigilance could be needed, in other words, twenty-four
hours of continuous wakefulness could be able to induce
only a mild and not significant (p=.07) worsening of
executive functions. In line with our hypothesis, conflict
resolution could be more difficult when a sleep deprivation
of great duration (i.e., longer than 24 hours and, therefore,
with a stronger reduction of alertness) is adopted, and/or
when a longer task is used. On the contrary, a moderate
TSD and a short task could have only a strong effect on the
alerting system, but it could be too much weak to induce a a
significant impairment of the executive control.
The different results through the studies could also
affected by the type of the task employed for assessing the
executive functions. A Flanker task could be fairly simple

DISCUSSION
Results confirm that the experimental paradigm adopted in
this study was able to produce an effective increase of RT
during the nocturnal session (4.00 a.m.), according to other
studies adopting the same experimental manipolation, i.e. a
24 hours of prolonged wakefulness (e.g., Casagrande et al.,
2006). The efficacy of the task used was also confirmed, as
indicated by both validity and congruency effects. On the
contrary, no effect of vigilance decrease on orienting
mechanisms was observed, in line with Casagrande et al.
(2006) study. This result could be due to the absence of
invalid cues in the ANT and, consequently, to the lack of
information about the reorienting mechanisms, that resulted
impaired in other studies (Fimm et al., 2006; Versace et al.,
2006). The absence of this interaction could be due to other
characteristics of the ANT, as the short duration of the task
and the use of a fixed SOA. These features could have made
the task very easy for allowing it to affect both orienting and
executive control. This conclusion is in line with other
results showing an independence of orienting from alerting
when a short and easy Covert Orienting Task was used
under a sleep deprivation condition (Casagrande et al.,
2006).
However, other authors using a short and easy Covert
Orienting Task under a sleep loss condition observed a
significant slowing down of RT in the reorienting (invalid
condition) mechanisms (Versace et al., 2006). A similar
interaction between alerting and orienting was found by
Fimm et al. (2006), but only in the left hemisphere. One of

and the performance could be not affected by TSD, as well
as that required by a Gambling task (Killgore et al., 2006).
However, another hypotesis could be advanced, in our
study the reduction of vigilance due to TSD could have been
compensate by the increase of phasic alerting elicited by the
visual cues. Specifically we have observed, like Fan et al.
(2002), a strong alerting effect for the spatial cue, which
permit participants to direct their attention to the target
stimulus area, reducing the influence of the surrounding
flankers.
Of course, the lack of any effect of sleep deprivation on
the Flanker task performance used in this study could seem
amazing. In fact, sleep loss would have had to compromise
high cognitive functions, as well as executive control,
mediated by the frontal lobes (e.g., Robbins, 1998). As a
matter of the fact, a mild sleep deprivation (i.e., 24 hours of
continuous wakefulness) causes a decrease of metabolic
activity in frontal cortex, thalamus, and striatum (Wu et al.,
2006), as well as in prefrontal areas (Thomas et al., 2000),
that are associated to poorer performance on complex
cognitive tasks (Thomas et al., 2003). However, when sleep
deprived, subjects showed a compensatory response to their
reduced performance ability; in fact, the impairment in RT,
under sleep deprivation, appears related with a greater
activation in the frontal and posterior midline cortical
regions (Drummond et al., 2005). Equally, a poor
performance on a divided attention task appears to be
associated with an increased activation in the bilateral
prefrontal cortex and parietal lobes (Drummond & Brown,
2001), particularly in the right hemisphere (Drummond,
Gillin, Brown, 2001).
In conclusion, based on behavioural results and on PET
data, one could hypothesize that the contrasting results on
tasks evaluating executive functions could be due to the type
of task used for evaluating the executive functions or from
the extention of sleep deprivation, but the things don't seem
go in this way. As a matter of the fact, an impairment in the
Stroop test was observed under both 24 hours (Lingenfelser
et al., 1994) or 36 hour (McCarthy & Waters, 1997) of
continuous wakefulness, but this result was not confirmed
by other authors (Binks et al., 1999). Specifically, our
results are in line with those of previous studies (Hsieh,
Cheng, and Tsai, 2007; Murphy et al., 2006), which found
no impairment in a flanker task performed by sleepdeprived subjects. At the same time, our results differ from
other findings showing an impairment in both RT and
response accuracy in a flanker task performed after one
night of sleep deprivation (Tsai et al., 2005).
In order to explain these inconsistent results, a further
hypothesis can be advanced. When sleep deprivation causes
a high reduction of vigilance, i.e., when attentional
performance is evaluated in a time window corresponding to
the primary sleep gate, all the attentional functions are
equally impaired, so it is hard to find selective effects on
executive functions or on orienting. In this condition, the
high inter-subjects variability to TSD effects (Banks &
Dinges, 2007), could, at least partly, account for many

experimental incongruent results found in TSD studies. As a
matter of the fact, neurobehavioral deficits from TSD vary
significantly among individuals and are stable within
individuals (Van Dongen et al., 2004). Based on a vast
review of sleep deprivation research, Banks & Dinges
(2007) suggested a trait-like differential vulnerability to
sleep deprivation. In line with this hypothesis it was found
that, after 48 h of sleep deprivation the de-activation of a
neural network, including posterior cerebellum, right
fusiform gyrus, precuneus, left lingual and inferior temporal
gyri, was effective only in subjects showing an impairment
in memory performance, but not in those able to maintain
higher performance (Bell-Mcginty et al., 2004). This
variability in neural and behavioural responses to TSD, in
conjunction with the intensity of vigilance decrease
produced by TSD, could account for many contrasting
results in this research area.
