Abstract

neurocognitive representations should differ for people who
perceive and act upon the environment in systematically
different ways. We investigated whether activity in motor
cortex during action verb processing reflects the way an
individual language user typically performs the action that
the verb refers to.
Across neuroimaging studies, activity in cortical motor
areas associated with manual action verbs has been leftlateralized (Aziz-Zadeh et al., 2006; Hauk et al., 2004;
Ruschemeyer, Brass, & Friederici, 2007; Tettamanti et al.,
2005). This lateralization could be due to the general lefthemisphere dominance for language. Alternatively, it could
be a consequence of testing only right-handed participants.
We propose that if word meanings are implicit simulations,
then understanding words for actions that people typically
perform with their dominant hand should involve simulating
these actions in contralateral premotor areas (i.e., areas that
subserve planning of actions with the dominant hand).
To test this proposal, we used fMRI to compare premotor
activation in right- and left-handers during a lexical decision
task on manual action verbs (e.g., grasp, throw) and nonmanual action verbs (e.g., kneel, giggle). If the motor
component of an action verb’s meaning is a body-specific
simulation of the action it refers to as the particular
language user would be likely to perform it, then activity in
premotor cortex during manual action verb processing
should be differently lateralized in right- and left-handers.
Each group should preferentially activate premotor areas
contralateral to their dominant hand.1
The non-manual action words served as a control. Finding
the predicted difference between right- and left-handers for
manual action words, alone, could be evidence for implicit
body-specific simulation of manual actions during word
reading. Alternatively, it could be an artifact of differences
in language laterality between right- and left-handers, more
generally. However, this alternative is ruled out by testing
for the predicted interaction of Hemisphere (right premotor,
left premotor) and Handedness (right-handed, left-handed)
in voxels that are significantly more active during manual
compared to non-manual action verbs (i.e., essentially, by
testing for a particular three-way interaction of Hemisphere,
Handedness, and Verb Type).

According to theories of embodied cognition, understanding a
verb like throw involves unconsciously simulating the action
throwing, using areas of the brain that support motor
planning. If understanding action words involves mentally
simulating our own actions, then the neurocognitive
representation of word meanings should differ for people with
different kinds of bodies, who perform actions in
systematically different ways. In a test of the body-specificity
hypothesis (Casasanto, 2009), we used fMRI to compare
premotor activity correlated with action verb understanding in
right- and left-handers. Right-handers preferentially activated
left premotor cortex during lexical decision on manual action
verbs (compared with non-manual action verbs), whereas lefthanders preferentially activated right premotor areas. This
finding helps refine theories of embodied semantics,
suggesting that implicit mental simulation during language
processing is body-specific: Right and left-handers, who
perform actions differently, use correspondingly different
areas of the brain for representing action verb meanings.

Introduction
Theories of embodied cognition propose an intimate link
between language and bodily experience. In this framework,
to understand a word is to create an implicit mental
simulation of its referent, using regions of the brain that
support perception and action (e.g. Anderson, 2003;
Barsalou, 2008; Zwaan, 2004). Consistent with this view,
studies show that when participants read action-related
verbs like ‘kick’, ‘pick’ and ‘lick’ they activate effectorspecific regions of premotor cortex, as when they move the
effector most associated with these verbs (i.e. their foot,
hand, or tongue) (Aziz-Zadeh, Wilson, Rizzolatti, &
Iacoboni, 2006; Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermuller, 2004;
Tettamanti et al., 2005).
The goal of the present study was to refine the notion of
implicit mental simulation during language processing, by
framing experimental predictions in terms of the bodyspecificity hypothesis (Casasanto, 2009): If concepts and
word meanings are constituted, in part, by implicit
simulations of our own perceptions and actions, then their

finger. No responses were made following critical stimuli
(MAN and NONMAN verbs). Response side varied
between filler trials, such that sometimes the left button
indicated ‘yes’ and sometimes the right button indicated
‘yes’. This was done to prevent biased motor preparation to
one response side. Participants had 1500 ms to respond and
got feedback on the screen when they were too slow.
Participants were familiarised with the procedure by means
of 10 practice trials before the start of the experiment, with
stimuli not used in the remainder of the experiment. Trial
onset was effectively jittered with respect to onset of
volume acquisition by varying the intertrial interval between
2 and 6 seconds in steps of 250 msec (mean ITI=4 sec)
(Dale, 1999).

Participants
We tested thirty-two healthy participants with no known
history of neurological problems, dyslexia or other
language-related problems, or hearing complaints, and with
normal or corrected-to-normal vision, all of whom gave
informed consent. Half of the participants were left-handed
(N=16, 12 female, mean age 23.4 years, range 19-32 years,
adapted Dutch version of Edinburgh Handedness Inventory
(EHI) score (Oldfield, 1971; Van Strien, 1992): mean=94.3, s.d.=8.7, range -82 - -100, mode=-100), and half were
right-handed (N=16, 10 female, mean age 23.2, range 20-29
years, EHI score: mean=96.6, s.d.=7.3, range 82 - 100,
mode=100). The groups did not differ in age (t(30)<1), or in
absolute EHI value (t(30)<1). The local ethics committee
approved the study.

Data acquisition and analysis Echo-Planar Images (EPI)
covering the whole brain were acquired with a 8 channel
head coil on a Siemens MR system with 3T magnetic field
strength (TR=2060 ms; TE=30 ms; flip angle 85°, 31
transversal slices; voxel size 3.5x3.5x3 mm, 0.5 mm gap
between slices). Preprocessing involved realignment
through rigid body registration to correct for head motion,
slice timing correction to the onset of the first slice,
normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
space, interpolation of voxel sizes to 2x2x2 mm, and spatial
smoothing (8 mm FWHM kernel). First-level analysis
involved a multiple regression analysis with regressors
describing the expected hemodynamic responses during
observation of MAN words, NONMAN words, fillers words
and non-words. Responses (button presses) were modelled
separately. MR disturbances due to small head movements
were accounted for by a series of nuisance regressors,
namely the linear and exponential changes in the scan-byscan estimated head motion, scan-by-scan average signals
from outside the brain, white matter, and cerebro-spinal
fluid (Verhagen, Grol, Dijkerman, & Toni, 2006). Head
motion never exceeded 3 mm or 0.05 degrees.
Given our a priori hypothesis, we created subject-specific
4mm spherical regions of interest with the maximally
activated voxel to the MAN stimuli (mapwise thresholded at
p<0.001) as the center coordinate, in cytoarchitectonically
defined left and right Brodmann Area (BA) 6 (Eickhoff,
Heim, Zilles, & Amunts, 2006). In this way we optimised
our analysis for each subject individually, while controlling
the location of the ROI by means of independent anatomical
data (see also Aziz-Zadeh et al., 2006). We ensured that no
voxels from the opposite hemisphere were taken into
account (which could occur due to the spherical shape of the
ROIs). A similar analysis was performed for primary motor
cortex by using cytoarchitectonic maps of BA4
(combination of BA4a and BA4p, (Geyer et al., 1996)). For
the BA4 analysis, in some participants no voxels responded
to the MAN contrast, so we computed the mean response
over BA4 instead of the maximally activated voxel
accordingly.

Materials
Stimuli were 96 Dutch verbs expressing concrete actions.
Half of these were related to manual actions (MAN), half of
them were not related to manual actions (NONMAN). This
distinction was pretested in a group of raters who did not
participate in the fMRI experiment (N=16), who scored for
each verb how much they associated that action with their
hand(s). MAN words were significantly more associated
with hand actions than NONMAN words (t(94)=23.60,
p<0.001, prep=0.99). MAN and NONMAN word lists did
not differ in imageability (assessed by the same group of
raters) (t(94)<1), number of phonemes (t(94)<1), lexical
frequency (taken from the CELEX database; t(94)<1)) and
number of letters (t(94)=1.51, p=0.13, prep=0.78). From the
materials that were rejected on the basis of the pretest, 16
filler items were created.
Additionally, 16 phonotactically legal non-words were
created, all with the suffix typical of the regular infinitive
form in Dutch (‘-en’). A stimulus list of 128 stimuli (48
MAN + 48 NONMAN + 16 fillers + 16 nonwords) was
created, and pseudo-randomised with the constraint that the
same condition was not repeated more than three times in a
row. A mirrored version of this list was presented to half of
the participants.

Procedures
Experimental procedure Participants performed a lexical
decision experiment in the MRI scanner. Stimuli were
presented using Presentation software (www.nbs.com,
version 10.2) and were projected from outside of the
scanner room onto a mirror attached to the head coil such
that the participant could see them. Words appeared for
1500 ms in white font, in the middle of a black background.
A fixation cross appeared for 500 ms before word
presentation, to signal the start of a new trial. In 25% of the
trials (i.e. filler and non-word trials), stimulus presentation
was followed by a screen with the question whether the
previous stimulus was an existing word or not. Participants
were instructed to answer as quickly and accurately as
possible by pressing a button with their left or right index

measures ANOVA with HEMISPHERE (left, right) as a
within-subjects factor and GROUP (left-handers, righthanders) as a between-subjects factor. Given our a priori
hypothesis we tested a specific interaction direction (i.e. left
hemisphere>right hemisphere in right-handers and righthemisphere>left-hemisphere in left-handers).
To assess sensitivity of areas outside of pre- and primary
motor cortex, we also conducted a whole brain analysis,
testing for the interactions described above in a random
effects group analysis. Correction for multiple comparisons
was implemented by thresholding the group statistical maps
at p<0.001 uncorrected and subsequently taking the cluster
extent into account to correct maps at p<0.05 (Friston,
Holmes, Poline, Price, & Frith, 1996).
Behavioral data analysis involved independent samples ttests on percentage of correct trials and late responses.

Hemisphere, and Verb Type in all voxels that responded to
the presentation of MAN words at p<0.001 within our
anatomical search region (left/right BA6). A pattern similar
to the results of the subject-specific ROI analysis was found
(Fig. 1b), although the interaction did not reach statistical
significance using the more coarsely-defined ROI
(MAN>NONMAN: Interaction HEMISPHERE x GROUP:
t(30)=1.59, d=0.41, p=0.12, prep=0.80; Main effect of
HEMISPHERE: F<1; Main effect of GROUP: F<1).
Interestingly, there was considerable variation in the
location of the subject-specific ROIs within our anatomical
search region, BA6. Whereas the majority of ROIs were
relatively lateral in premotor cortex, the ROIs in a few
participants were more medial, in pre-supplementary motor
area (pre-SMA), another part of BA6 also involved in motor
planning (Nachev, Kennard, & Husain, 2008) (see Table 1
and Fig. 2). Importantly, a similar association between
handedness and hemisphere was found in pre-SMA as in
lateral premotor cortex.
No effects of hemisphere or group were observed in BA4
(primary motor cortex), attesting to the specificity of this
finding for premotor cortex (MAN>NONMAN: Interaction
HEMISPHERE x GROUP: t(30)<1, Main effect of
HEMISPHERE: F(1,30)<1; Main effect of GROUP:
F(1,30)<1; MAN words only: Interaction HEMISPHERE x

F(1,30)=6.95, η2p=0.19; MSe=0.75, p=0.01, prep=0.94;

effect of HEMISPHERE: F(1,30)=6.25, η2p=0.17;
MSe=0.67, p=0.02, prep=0.93; Main effect of GROUP:
F<1). Similar effects were obtained when taking all
responsive voxels in BA4 into account. Likewise in a whole
brain analysis, no areas were significantly activated by the
directional Group x Verb Type interactions.

Results
Behavioral results
The groups did not differ in percentage of correct responses
on the lexical decision task (left-handers: 93.9% (s.d. 5.5);
right-handers: 95.5% (s.d. 3.6); t(30)<1), or in the
percentage of too-late responses (left-handers: 0.58% (s.d.
1.26); right-handers: 0.19% (s.d. 0.78); t(30)=1.05, p=0.30,
prep=0.64).
Neural results
The main analysis tested for a 3-way interaction of
Handedness, Hemisphere, and Verb Type during lexical
decision on manual and nonmanual verbs, in subjectspecific ROIs within BA6 (premotor cortex). Results
showed a significant HEMISPHERE x GROUP interaction
in the MAN>NONMAN contrast values from the subjectspecific ROIs (t(30)=2.14, d=0.64, p=0.04, prep=0.89; Fig.
1a). For manual compared to non-manual action verbs, lefthanders had consistently stronger activations in right BA6,
whereas right-handers showed stronger activation in left
BA6 for this contrast, consistent with predictions based on
the body-specificity hypothesis. There were no main effects
of Hemisphere or Group (all F<1).
To confirm that this 3-way interaction was driven by the
predicted difference in MAN responses (rather than by
incidental differences in NONMAN responses), we
analyzed MAN and NONMAN responses separately. The
predicted 2-way interaction was present in the premotor
response to MAN stimuli alone, but not to NONMAN
stimuli (MAN HEMISPHERE x GROUP interaction:
F(1,30)=5.71, η2p=0.16, MSe=0.30, p=0.02, prep=0.95;
Main effect of HEMISPHERE: F(1,30)=4.77, η2p=0.14;
MSe=0.30, p=0.04; prep=0.89; Main effect of GROUP:
F<1; NONMAN HEMISPHERE x GROUP interaction:
F(1,30)=1.78, η2p=0.05, MSe=0.35, p=0.19, prep=0.73;
Main effect of HEMISPHERE: F(1,30)=2.72, η2p=0.08;
MSe=0.35, p=0.11, prep=0.81; Main effect of GROUP:
F<1).
To corroborate the main subject-specific ROI analysis, we
tested for the predicted interaction of Handedness,

Discussion
This study investigated whether the meanings of action
verbs are grounded in the ways that particular language
users perform the actions they refer to. During a lexical
decision task, right- and left-handers showed contrasting
patterns of activity in brain regions responsible for planning
manual actions when reading manual action verbs like grasp
and throw, as compared to reading non-manual action verbs.
Each group preferentially activated premotor areas in the
hemisphere contralateral to their dominant hand, suggesting
that the motor component of manual action verb semantics
is body-specific (Casasanto, 2009). People with different
bodies, who perform actions in systematically different
ways, use correspondingly different neural tissues for
representing action verb meanings.
Is it possible that these results reveal activation due to
conscious mental imagery of actions, which could have been
induced inadvertently by the lexical decision task? We
conducted a control task to evaluate this possibility. After
completing the lexical decision task, participants performed
a mental imagery task in which they saw all of the manual

and non-manual action verbs again, and were asked to
consciously imagine performing the actions they referred to.
Space precludes reporting the details of the mental
imagery data here. Importantly, however, when activity
during lexical decision for manual action verbs and
conscious imagery of manual actions was compared
directly, we found no significant overlap between tasks in
either primary or premotor areas, and no correlation
between activity during the two tasks in subject-specific
premotor ROIs. We can therefore conclude with high
confidence that premotor activity during the lexical decision
task was not due to conscious mental imagery, but rather to
lexical processes, per se (see also Tettamanti, et al., 2005;
Tomasino, et al., 2007).

everyone observes about the same proportion of right- and
left-handed actions by other people. The discovery that
motor activity associated with manual action words is bodyspecific supports the egocentric possibility, and suggests
that people implicitly simulate their own prior or potential
actions when understanding action words.
Is the perspective that people adopt when understanding
action words fixed? We suggest that the egocentric
simulations participants appear to have created during this
lexical decision task reflect a default interpretation of the
words’ meanings, but not the only possible interpretation.
Furthermore, these results do not imply that people can only
understand language about actions they have performed
themselves. We propose, for example, that someone who
has never used chopsticks could still understand the
sentence He picked up the dumpling with chopsticks by
creating a motor simulation based on visual experiences of
other people using chopsticks, and on extrapolation from
familiar motor actions (eating with a fork, holding a pencil
between the fingertips, etc.) (see Anderson, 2003). It
remains an open question whether people can understand
words referring to actions they have never performed as
completely as words for actions they have, and whether
implicit simulations of actions they have never performed
are body-specific (see Aglioti, Cesari, Romani, & Urgesi,
2008; Calvo-Merino, Grezes, Glaser, Passingham, &
Haggard, 2006).
The functional significance of premotor activity for
language understanding also remains a question for ongoing
research. Due to the correlational nature of fMRI data, it is
not possible to infer whether the premotor activity reported
here is a necessary part of action verb semantics (see
Willems & Hagoort, 2007 for discussion). Although some
constituents of word meaning may be abstracted away from
our physical experiences (Mahon & Caramazza, 2008), the
present results suggest that at least part of action word
meaning consists in implicit mental simulations of actions
as we would perform them with our particular bodies.

Mental simulation during language processing
These findings suggest two refinements to the notion of
implicit mental simulation during language processing.
First, embodied cognition researchers sometimes suggest
that unconscious simulation and conscious imagery are
identical processes (e.g., Gallese & Lakoff, 2005). Indeed,
some careful researchers have stated that they use the terms
‘mental simulation’ and ‘mental imagery’ synonymously
(e.g., Bergen, et al., 2007 pg. 735). Yet, the present data
urge caution in equating the notions of implicit simulation
during language processing and explicit mental imagery.
Both implicit (unconscious) simulation and explicit
(conscious) imagery engage body-specific representations in
premotor cortex, but these representations may be different
in character. When we read the verb throw, the
corresponding premotor activity may constitute a far less
elaborated action plan than when we consciously imagine
throwing. Understanding throw apparently involves an
action representation that is specified with respect to which
arm we would use. But at least by default, the motor plan
activated by a clause like throw the ball may lack the kinds
of further specification that would be needed if we were to
imagine this action explicitly (e.g., Is it an underhand or
overhand throw? Is it a baseball or a basketball?) At
minimum, premotor representations underlying implicit
simulation and explicit imagery must differ quantitatively,
in terms the detail with which action plans are specified.
The finding of distinct premotor representations for these
processes raises the possibility that they differ qualitatively,
as well.
A second refinement these data suggest concerns the
perspective that readers adopt when understanding action
words. Based on previous studies (e.g. Aziz-Zadeh et al.,
2006; Hauk et al., 2004; Tettamanti et al., 2005), it was not
clear to what extent the motor component of action word
meanings reflects actions we have observed others
performing (allocentric simulation) or actions we have
performed ourselves (egocentric simulation). The
allocentric possibility predicts that neurocognitive
representations of manual action word meanings should be
similar in right- and left-handers, since presumably

previous literature. For instance, Longcamp and colleagues
showed that observation of letters leads to motor resonance
in left ventral premotor cortex in right-handers (Longcamp,
