             randomly displaced on the vertical dimension to minimize instances of complete superposition of
             points. The histograms on the right show the same behavioral data that are displayed in the scatter
             bars.

to distinguish between decision makers whose
metacognition tells them that their expressed belief has a
basis in data, and those who feel that they were simply
guessing and that their belief consequently has no basis in
data.
   In summary, the present findings indicate that when
decision makers use very small samples to infer
correlations, the resulting distribution of beliefs is not a
simple scattering of points about the true population
correlation. Rather, the belief distribution is multi-clustered
in a way that reflects the statistical characteristics of the
environment, and that suggests an internal mental
representation that matches signed r2 more than r.
