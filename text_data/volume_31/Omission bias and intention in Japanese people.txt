Abstract: Western people generally judge acts of commission as morally worse than equivalent acts of omission.
This tendency is called ”omission bias.” This study examines whether omission bias occurs in Japanese. Participants
were 43 Japanese undergraduate students. Five tasks were prepared. Each presented two stories with a similar
structure but one key difference: the agent’s act was either commission or omission. In one story, the agent did
something causing a bad outcome; in the other story the agent did nothing causing the same bad outcome. The
results showed that, in all five tasks, participants tended to judge that the agent who did something was morally
worse than the agent who did nothing, but that participants also perceived that the do-something agent had stronger
intention than the do-nothing agent in all five tasks. These results demonstrate omission bias in Japanese, which
may occur by perceiving agents’ intentions differently between commission and omission.
