Abstract: The nature of timbre effects in recognition memory for melodies played by multiple instruments was
investigated in a single experiment, by comparing performance when studied melodies were repeated in same, differ-
ent, or new timbres at test. Melodies that remained in the same timbre from study to test were recognized better
than were melodies that were presented in a previously studied but different, or previously unstudied (new) timbre
at test; performance for melodies that were presented in a different timbre at test did not differ reliably from that
for melodies in a new timbre at test. Our data suggest the intriguing possibility that the timbre effects observed
in recognition memory for melodies are attributed solely to instance-specific matching rather than timbre-specific
familiarity; memory representations that subserve explicit recognition of melodies appear to be formed by a highly
specialized association that binds together timbre characteristics and melody identity.
