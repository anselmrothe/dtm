which dependent players who reveal their goals are assisted
by independent players, while not incurring a loss to their
own benefit, as compared to using position-based protocols.
   There are few works offering an empirical analysis of
people’s negotiation strategies in repeated interactions. Ru-
binstein (1985) has provided a theoretical model for pre-
scribing negotiating strategies in such settings that are op-
timal under certain conditions (e.g., participants are ratio-
nal and consistent in their beliefs about each other’s objec-
tives). Work in the psychological literature about strategic in-
teraction has focused on specific domains (e.g., seller-buyer
disputes (G. Loewenstein, Bazerman, & Thompson, 1989),
mid-east peace talks (Atran, Axelrod, & Davis, 2007)) or                              (a) Main and Pending Offer Panels
completely abstract settings such as the Prisoners Dilemma.
Loewenstein and Brett (2007) conducted a study which stud-
ied how goal framing prior to the negotiation procedure af-
fects strategy revision. None of these works have compared
the effects of goal revelation directly within repeated negoti-
ation. Work by Heiskanen, Ehtamo, and Hamalaien (2001)
has found that people minimize the amount of private infor-
mation they reveal in negotiation to avoid weakening their
positions, while Vorauer and Claude (1998) observes that ne-
gotiators overestimate their partners’ beliefs about their own
goals in certain conditions. We show that when using a medi-
ated protocol for goal solicitation and revelation, negotiators
are willing to disclose private information to others and that
this allows them to reach mutual beenefical agreements.                                    (b) Decision-support tool
