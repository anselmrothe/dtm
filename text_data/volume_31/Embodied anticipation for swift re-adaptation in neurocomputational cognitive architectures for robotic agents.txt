for modeling emotions. It requires the presence of emotion-

   As a matter of fact, all the above is in contrast to the tra-
ditional perspective on AI and cognitive science, i.e., the pre-
sumption that the description of the world in terms of related
symbol structures and logical processing on such structures is
the necessary and sufficient condition for general intelligent
action by appropriate instances of physical systems (Newell,
1980). A concept mapped in cognitive robotics onto the lin-
ear sense-plan-execute scheme, and conceptually akin to the
functional approach of computational neuroscience, focused
on specific and decontextualized sub-domains.
