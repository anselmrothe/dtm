Abstract: Computer-based studies examining how adults learn name-object mappings typically present objects
from a single view across trials (e.g., from above). In the real-world, however, we encounter objects from a variety of
views. In the current study we explored the real-time dynamics of object rotation on word learning. Each participant
received three word learning blocks. Within blocks objects were either presented always from the same view, from one
of two views or from one of four views. Overall, adults quickly learned the 24 name-object mappings. Initial accuracy
was best when objects were presented from only one or two views, however, by the sixth encounter there were no
differences between conditions. Reaction times decreased within blocks at similar rates across conditions, indicating
that object rotation does not impede skilled (adult) word learners. Trial-by-trial analyses provide additional insight
into the dynamics and cognitive processes underlying learning names for rotated objects.
