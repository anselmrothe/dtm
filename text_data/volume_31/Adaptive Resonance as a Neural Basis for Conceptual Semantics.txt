                    Model Description
ART is a three-layer architecture with two auxiliary
mechanisms for controlling network activity (gain control
mechanism and reset mechanism) as shown in Figure 1.
Layers are denoted as F0, F1 and F2 (Carpenter &
Grossberg, 2003). F0 is an input layer which registers the
pattern of sensory stimulation. F1 layer reads-out the
sensory pattern from F0 and combines it with the top-down
expectations arriving from the F2 layer. The activation
flows from F1 to F2 and passes through a filter of adaptive
weights. The F2 layer is a winner-takes-all network which
represents the category or the concept that best match the
sensory input. The gain control mechanism, G, enables
distinctions to be made between sensory stimulation and
internal activation. Only sensory stimulation is allowed to
reach the supra-threshold activation and to ignite resonance
between F1 and F2 layers. Finally, the orienting subsystem,
R, watches for the difference between the bottom-up
activation from F0 and the top-down activations from F2. It
produces a reset signal when the difference is larger than a
certain prescribed value. The reset signal shuts-off the          Figure 1. Modified ART circuit for perceptual simulation.
