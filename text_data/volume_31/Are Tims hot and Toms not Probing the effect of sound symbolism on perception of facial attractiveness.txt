Abstract: Amy Perfors attracted much attention in 2004 by showing that the sounds of a given name affected the
perceived attractiveness of its bearer. Back vowel names (Sue) made women appear more attractive, whereas males
benefited from front vowel names (Tim). Being at variance with strict Saussurean arbitrariness and in line with
the reality of sound symbolism, these findings inspired us to try a replication with German names under a modified
design where more variables, including gender of subjects, were controlled. Male names were paired with male
faces and female names with female faces in a randomized way. In contrast to Perfors, we found that the subjectâ€™s
gender and not that of the pictured person determined the relationship between vowel quality and perceived facial
attractiveness. Whatever the determinants of her findings: German women clearly prefer Toms over Tims, and males
vice versa. Possible explanations for this difference will be discussed.
