       diversity as measured by a nouns associative indegree. Here
       we extend this analysis to CHILDES indegree, examing the
       three growth hypotheses we investigated in Hills et al. (In
       press).
         The three growth rules are as follows (Figure 1):
       preferential attachment – based on the connectivity of
       known words; preferential acquisition – based on the
       connectivity of new words to all words in the learning
       environment; and a third intermediate possibility, lure of
       associates, based on the connectivity of new words to
       known words. For preferential attachment, a word is more
       likely to be learned if it attaches to an existing already
       known word in the network that is itself well attached. In
       this way, richly connected words become more richly
       connected. In contrast, with preferential acquisition, a word
       is more likely to be learned if it is attached to many other
       words in the learning environment. The lure of associates
       lies between the above two; at the time-of-acquisition, the
       child learns next the word that attaches to the most already
       known words.
         We asked which model for growth best fits the CHILDES
       degree using a maximum likelihood test. Our basic growth
       model determines how strongly the growing network
       weighs the value of new words at each month in the growth
       of the network, with value determined by the model. We do
       this using a parameter, β , which we fit to an exponential
       ratio of strengths rule. We calculate the probability that a
       word, w i , is added to the network at a given month based
       on its value, di , using the following:
                      €e βd i
            P(w i ) =      βd j
