Participants
Fifty-eight children from a primary school in the
Netherlands participated in this study; twenty-nine from
second grade (group 4 in the Dutch school system) and
twenty-nine from fifth grade (group 7). The 14 boys and 15
girls in second grade had a mean age of 7 years and six
months (SD = 0.51), and the 14 boys and 15 girls in fifth
grade had a mean age of 10 years and nine months (SD =
0.48). Parents were informed about the experiment
beforehand and returned a consent form for their child’s
participation and usage of recorded material for research
purposes.
