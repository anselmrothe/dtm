Methods
Participants Twenty-two university students were paid to par-
ticipate in the experiment. Two were excluded due to an excessive
number of EEG artifacts, and a further three were excluded because
of insufficient number of trials in the skeletal condition, leaving 17
participants for the behavioural and EEG analysis (mean age 22.2;
SD 3.3). All were free from neurological disorders and had normal
or corrected-to-normal vision.
Stimuli and Apparatus We presented alphanumeric characters
in black on a white background at a distance of 100cm on a 21” CRT
computer screen (1024x768 @ 85Hz) using the Psychophysics tool-
box (Brainard, 1997) running on Matlab version 6.5 under Microsoft
Windows XP. Stimuli were in Arial font and had an average size of
2.1◦ x 3.4◦ visual angle.
Procedure Participants viewed four blocks (3 RSVP/1 Onset,
counterbalanced between subjects) of 100 trials. Within each block,
there were 96 trials containing a single target and four trials consist-
ing only of distractors. Five practice trials preceded the first block       Figure 1: Human ERP for targets in RSVP and Onset presen-
