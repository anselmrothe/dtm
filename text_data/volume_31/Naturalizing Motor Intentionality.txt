Naturalizing Motor Intentionality
Daniel Hsi-wen Liu
Providence University
Abstract: This research argues that the processing of motor activities is content-bearing, and that the motor
content is to be understood in a pragmatic sense, a novel sense of content different from the semantic sense of
content that visual processing bears. The semantic sense of content is based on Brentanos notion of intentionality,
made possible by a standing-for relation. By contrast, the pragmatic sense of content is based on Merleau-Pontys
(1962) notion of motor intentionality, according to which motor skills are pre-predicative. This research maintains
a philosophical discussion on the basis of Jeannerods (2006) psychological theory of motor cognition and MerleauPontys phenomenological notion of motor intentionality. This research argues that motor activities are made available
under the purposeful processing with a pre-determined goal. This way of maneuvering motor resources in the light
of accomplishing a given goal, is the pragmatic sense in which motor actions are understood as content-bearing.
