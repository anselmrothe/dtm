                           Method
Participants
Participants were 97 seventh- and 80 eighth-grade students
from a public middle school in central Massachusetts. We
chose this group because middle school may be the time to
optimally learn model-based inquiry skills (Schunn,
Raghavan, & Cho, 2007). At this school, each grade level
had its own science teacher who taught five different class
sections. All sections participated in the experiment.
Materials
Our study makes use of the ASSISTment system, a web-
based intelligent tutoring system for mathematics that
simultaneously assesses students while they receive
assistance with particular math problems (Heffernan,
Turner, Lourenco, Macasek, Nuzzo-Jones, & Koedinger,
2006). It provides the capability to easily create static
content, i.e. multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, and open
response questions with embedded images, videos, and
Flash files. It also tracks student information like skill

correct answers, and number of hints received, and provides        Figure 1: Typical ASSISTment question using the ramp
