time. The whole-part judgment task, first used by Palmer
(1978) to assess the naturalness of different decompositions
of visual objects into parts and subsequently by Pevtzow
and Goldstone (1994) to look at the influence of experience
on part decompositions, is ideal for measuring changes or
differences in sensitivity to components of objects. This task
consists of comparing a whole object to a part probe and
asking participants if the part probe is a subset of the whole
object. The whole object and the part probe may both be
presented at once or in sequence. Correct answers rely on
accurately comparing all segments in the part probe to the
whole and determining if there is a match for each segment.
In trials when the whole object is presented only before the
part probe is present, whole-part judgments require a
memory component as well as perceptual processing. The
logic of whole-part judgment tasks relies on the assumption
that decision processes will be more accurate if the part
probe aligns with the functional features used to process and
identify the whole object. The closer the part probe aligns            Figure 1: A scaled-down example of stimuli used in both
