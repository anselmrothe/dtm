Allopenna et al. 1998). That is, during a spoken word,
listeners are updating a set of guesses as to what word they
are hearing. This is reflected in eye movements. If two
words share sounds initially, such as mask and mast, a
listener will be equally likely to look at either a displayed
picture of a mask or one of a mast until the end of hearing
“mask” spoken. However, if the two words are dissimilar,
such as mask and flute, the listener hearing “mask” will look
to the mask around the beginning of mask. The time point
where looks to two similarly-named pictures diverge

the speech signal to identify words.
   The rationale in the current studies is similar. We taught
listeners melodies with certain properties, and then
examined how rapidly they fixated the correct picture (of
two) when the melody “labels” did or did not overlap in
absolute pitch. Among the melodies learned (Figure 1),
certain pairs of melodies matched each other until the end,
with either identical absolute pitch (AP-same; CDEFG:
CDEFE) or with absolute pitch level differing by 6
semitones (AP-different; GFAGC; C# BD#C#F#). If listeners
can use AP information to recognize melodies, they should
look sooner to the correct object on AP mismatch trials than
AP match trials.
                       Experiment 1
In this experiment, we trained listeners to associate melodies
with pictures. We then measured looks to the pictures while
listeners heard a melody “label” in real time to determine
what cues listeners used to distinguish paired melodies.                  Figure 2. A sample test trial, with examples of two

the other half, the actual pitches were separated by a tritone
and only the intervals were the same (AP-different). The
tritone separation was selected to be comparable to Saffran
and Griepentrog’s (2001) AP experiment in which adults
failed to learn to distinguish tone groups in a segmentation
task. This also served to minimize confusion of the key area
from melody to melody, as closely-related pitch areas tend
to be parsed according to the preceding context (Bartlett &
Dowling, 1980). AP match/mismatch was counterbalanced
across melody pairs and participants.
   Four different quasirandom melody-to-shape assignments
were used to control against spurious cross-modal
similarities between particular melodies and particular
pictures. Each trial (see Procedure) showed pictures in two
of four locations (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower
right of screen); one of the two pictures was the target. The
other picture was either the picture for the paired melody, or
the picture for a particular dissimilar melody. The two types
of “other” pictures occurred equally often, and each target
appeared equally often in each of the four screen locations.               Figure 3. Accuracy during the first three blocks of

Recall that four pitch ranges were used in Experiment 1.
That is, instead of encoding the absolute pitches of the
stimuli, perhaps they encoded the pitch range, for instance,
as low, mid-low, mid-high, and high. This is difficult to
discriminate from absolute pitch even with a strongly
delayed test phase, because as soon as the test phase begins
the pitch range is reestablished.
   We addressed this in Experiment 2 issue by requiring
listeners to use relative pitch information, and to look for
interference from absolute pitch processing. We trained
participants on melodies at one set of absolute pitch levels
(around C4, around F#4, around C5, around F#5) and then
tested them at a different pitch level (F#4, C5, F#5, C6). We
created a set of melodies where not two but three melodies
overlapped until a final note. Two of the melodies were in
one pitch range at training (such as F#4), while the third was
pitched a tritone below at training (such as around C4). The
first test block continued this pattern. The second and third
test blocks, however, shifted all melodies up by exactly a                    Figure 5. (a) Sample stimuli from Experiment 2. (b)
