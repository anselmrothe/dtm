capacity of attentional resources cannot be reconciled easily
with what is known about brain mechanisms. Torralbo and
Beck (2008) proposed that the neural basis for perceptual
load is the extent of competition among stimuli to gain
representation in the visual cortex and the strength of a top-
down biasing mechanism that is needed to resolve the
competition and select a stimulus.
   Although Torralbo and Beck (2008) offer a more concrete
definition of what constitutes perceptual load, their proposal
still seems vague. For example, it is not clear what the
nature of the top-down biasing mechanism is and how
exactly it operates. In the present study we adopt a

Top-down influence and synchronization of neural
activity
   The firing rates of neurons in the salience map represent
biddings of stimuli for attention. However, as shown in
Figure 1 the rates of neurons in the saliency map are
modulated by top-down factors. We argue that endogenous
goals referring to expectations about the possible location of
the upcoming target may modulate the rate of neurons in the
saliency map (see also Poghosyan & Ioannides, 2008). This
is compatible with recent evidence showing that activity in
V1 may appear before the presentation of the stimulus when
its position is primed by a cue (Shibata et al., 2008; Silver,
Ress, & Heeger, 2007).
   In addition to influence from top-down spatial goals, the
neural activation of each stimulus is progressively
modulated by top-down signals of semantic information.                         Figure 2. The correlation control module

appeared simultaneously on the left or on the right of the
circular array and it was compatible (identical to the target),
incompatible (calling for the alternative response) or neutral
(the letter L) in 1/3 of the trials. Participants were requested
to ignore the distractor letter and focus on identifying the
target (X or Z) in the 6-letter search array. They were
instructed to press “0” for X and “2” for Z as fast as possible
using their thumb and their index finger respectively on the
numeric keyboard. The search array remained onscreen for
200 ms and was replaced by a mask. Participants were
allowed to enter their response for up to 2000 ms after the
offset of the search array.
   In cue-present trials an asterisk was presented for 150 ms
after the offset of the fixation point. The cue was located
either in the same location as the target letter (valid cue), or             Figure 6: Median Latency for low load condition

   As seen in Figure 5, no difference between the cue
conditions was observed in the high load condition, p = .52.
However, distractor interference in the low load condition
was significantly reduced when a valid cue was provided
(Figure 6). Indeed, a paired sample t-test revealed a
significant difference between incompatible and neutral
trials in the low load condition, t(23) = 4,04, p< .001.
   The pattern of results obtained in the experiment
replicated the typical pattern of findings of perceptual-load
studies (Lavie, 1995). Furthermore, it showed that cueing
interacts with perceptual load. Johnson et al., (2002) have
shown that a 100% valid central cue diminished interference
from incompatible distractors in the low-load condition,                  Figure 7: Simulation results for high load condition
equating in fact the extent of interference in the low and
high load conditions. The present experiment provided
evidence that an 80% valid peripheral cue was similarly
effective. The present results are incompatible with at least a
strong version of the perceptual-load theory as they show
that even in low-load conditions, in which spare resources
exist to process a distractor, interference may be absent.
