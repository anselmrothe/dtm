Abstract: Research has shown that worked-examples play an important role in learning and problem solving and
are crucial to cognitive skill acquisition. We propose to extend previous work on example-based learning systems with
regard to the instructional design of the examples themselves. This can be done by drawing on current developments
in Cognitive Load Theory. We aim to explore the roles that worked-examples play in novices analogical problem
solving in programming. Specifically, our research into effective strategies for learning from worked-examples seeks
to promote schema acquisition and transfer. We also examine the degree to which individual learning/cognitive
style might influence the learning process. Several questions will be addressed: To what extent does the design of
the worked-examples foster schema acquisition and transfer? Are the effects of these factors mediated by individual learning/cognitive style? If so, how do different students learn from worked-examples? This abstract reports
preliminary findings of ongoing research.
