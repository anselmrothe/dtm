             Analysing Yu & Smith (2007)
In order to demonstrate conclusively that a group of word
learners are capable of cross-situational word learning, the
following three steps are necessary: (1) Present those learners
with a sequence of training exposures to a target word or tar-
get words; (2) Test those learners on their ability to correctly       (c)                               (d)

identify the meaning of each target word; (3) Demonstrate
that the resulting performance is significantly better than that
which could be obtained by any learner using a single one of
those training exposures (i.e. the learning performance truly
indicates cross-situational, rather than one-shot, learning).
   YS present a series of word-learning studies which they ar-
gue meet these three criteria. We believe a deficiency in their
testing regime (item 2 above) means that they are not in fact
able to satisfy the third requirement: a learner capable of only    Figure 1: Training (a–c) and test (d) exposures in the YS 3x3
