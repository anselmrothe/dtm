105 pairs in Lists A and B. When we calculated the differ-
ence in familiarity, the familiarity rating of the smaller city
was subtracted from that of the larger city. Thus, a differ-
ence greater than 0 means that participants were more famil-
iar with the larger city, and a difference less than 0 means
that participants were more familiar with the smaller city.
Figures 1 and 2 show the relationship between the mean
choice rates of the larger city and the mean differences of
familiarity for List A and List B.
     To examine the effect of familiarity on population infe-
rences, we proposed a model representing the choice rates
of the larger city on the log odds scale:
         p MCL
 log             = aX Mdiff + b                (1)                    Figure 1. The relationship between the mean choice rates

where PMCL represent the mean choice rate of the larger city,
XMdiff represents mean difference in familiarity, and a and b
denote free parameters for weight and intercept, respectively.
This model assumes that the choice rates shift depending on
the difference in familiarity. We assessed the fit of equation
(1) by regressing PMCL in log odds units on the difference in
familiarity. Table 2 presents the results of the regression
analyses, displaying regression coefficients for a, b, and R2.
The regression lines are shown in Figures 1 and 2 as a func-
tion of PMCL that is transformed from the equation (1).
     These results indicate that for both lists, the familiarity
of cities influenced inferences about population. Specifical-
ly, the results suggest that participants who are more famili-
ar with a city infer that the city is more populous. Therefore
the aggregated data support our hypothesis about the effect
of familiarity on inferences.
     It should be noted that there was a substantial difference       Figure 2. The relationship between the mean choice rates

    Second, inference patterns in the recognized/not-
recognized pairs cannot be simply explained by the differ-
ence in familiarity. This indicates that inferences in recog-

previous studies have claimed (e.g., Pachur & Hertwig,
2006; Pachur et al., in press).

particular, our findings suggest that when people have cer-

ferences on familiarity. Some researchers have argued that
people do not always use the recognition heuristic. Pachur
