source of interference. This way, naming a color involves
going through a verbal step. Having to select names of
colors presented on screen makes the manual Stroop task
more compatible with the standard (vocal) Stroop task, by
bringing back its semantic and linguistic components.
Interference arises from the possibility to retrieve an
incorrect color name as in the vocal variant of the task. Each
response option has an equal probability to appear on the
left or right sides of the stimulus, thus preventing the
selection process from becoming automated.

the task no feedback was provided. The task was self-paced.
Results
The data of one participant were excluded from analysis,
because the latencies exceeded 2000 ms on average (this
criterion had previously been used to exclude data from
analysis in Miyake et al., 2000; Cho et al. 2006). As a
consequence of this exclusion, each group was composed of
31 participants. A number of trials (4.52%) were excluded
from analysis because they had very low (lower than 300
ms) or very high (higher than 2000 ms) latencies.
   A first analysis was intended to check if our modified
version of the manual Stroop task produced levels of
interference comparable with the classical vocal Stroop task.

manifestation in model’s behavior.
   The focus of our modeling efforts is on the top-down
modulation of Stroop dilution. For this reason, other aspects
of the Stroop task are treated very briefly. Whenever
possible, we have used modeling ideas and techniques that
have been proposed by other authors (Altmann & Davidson,
2001; Cohen, Dunbar, & McClelland, 1990; Herd, Banich,
& O'Reilly, 2006; Lovett, 2005; Roelofs, 2003).
   The following is a verbal trace of the model behavior at
pre-treatment. The model perceives the stimulus and
temporarily represents its color and word dimensions. These
representations spread activation toward their associated
words and concepts in memory. For example, if the stimulus
is the word “red” in blue color (incongruent condition), the
word “red” and the concept of blueness will be activated in
memory. In order to reflect the fact that humans have higher
practice at reading words than at naming colors, word
representations have higher strengths of association with
their corresponding memory elements than color                          Figure 5: Fit of the computational model to the data. The

performing an action, the model would commit an error,                   When the extra stimuli are removed (post-treatment), their
