Procedure The study was conducted as part of a series of
studies. Participants took part in groups of 25 and required
no more than 3 minutes to complete the questionnaire. Each
participant provided one explanation for a comparative fact
and subsequently rated that explanation for the degree to
which the explanation focused on one or the other
component of the fact. In addition, participants gave an
overall judgment of their focus in their explanation.
Results
Influence of Gender First we looked at the effect of gender
stereotyping on the focus in explanations in the sports
profession items in order to validate the procedure of
Experiment 2. Overall only 39% of explanations regarding a
gender difference among ballet dancers focused on women
whereas for football players it was 53% (χ2(1, N = 193) =
3.96, p < .05). Thus the data for sports professions
replicated the influence of gender stereotyping on who
received most attention in explanations.
Influence of Position & Frame In order to test the
influence of Position and Frame on the overall judgment of
focus, a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 hierarchical loglinear analysis was
carried out with Item topic (Sports vs. Politics), Item
(Male/Professor vs. Female/Teacher), Position (e.g.,
Professor-First vs. Teacher-First) and Frame (more vs. less)
as independent variables. As in Experiment 1, we found an
overall preference to explain the first part of the fact (65%
of people; χ2(1, N = 374) = 32.4, p < .001). This bias was
again moderated by the way the attribute was framed with
81% focusing on the first part when it was framed as ‘more
... than’ and only 49% focusing on the first when it was
framed as ‘less ... than’ (χ2(1, N = 374) = 41.2, p < .001).           Figure 3: The interaction between Item topic, Item and
