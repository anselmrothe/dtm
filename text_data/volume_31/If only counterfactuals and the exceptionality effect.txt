of the players’ individual techniques means that they will
each respond differently to Peter’s betting actions.
Peter’s cards are very good. However how much Peter
bets has consequences. Betting small, medium or large
will affect the reactions of the three opposition players in
different manners, as follows:
If Peter bets small, his bet will be €10. This will result in
probably all three opposition players matching his bet.
(Peter’s €10 matched by Mouse’s €10 + Lion’s €10 +
Jackal’s €10)
If Peter bets medium, his bet will be €20. This will result
in probably only the Lion and the Jackal matching his bet.
(Peter’s €20 matched by Lion’s €20 + Jackal’s €20)
If Peter bets large, his bet will be €30. This will result in
probably only the Jackal matching his bet.
(Peter’s €30 matched by + Jackal’s €30).
