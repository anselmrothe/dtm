Abstract
People create counterfactual ‘if only’ alternatives that change
exceptional actions to be normal (e.g., ‘if only he had placed
his usual small bet he would have lost less money’). Two
experiments show that this effect is reversed when an
exceptional alternative leads to a better outcome. Experiment
1 demonstrated the standard effect: an exceptional action that
leads to a bad outcome is changed to a usual one when an
exceptional alternative does not lead to a better outcome.
Experiment 2 reversed the effect: an exceptional action that
leads to a good outcome is changed to an exceptional
alternative when the alternative might have led to an even
better outcome. Both experiments also show that participants
construct different counterfactual thoughts when they think
not only about the outcome but also about the decision the
actor makes. The implications for theories of the
counterfactual imagination are discussed.
Keywords: Counterfactual thinking, the exceptionality effect,
decision-making, reasons for actions.

Introduction
Counterfactual ‘if only’ thoughts are a pervasive part of
everyday life. They tend to be created after bad outcomes.
Individuals can learn from mistakes when they think about
how things could be better (e.g., Byrne, 2002; Roese, 1997;
Roese & Olson, 1995). For example, when an actor loses
money in a gamble, individuals can create counterfactual
alternatives such as, ‘if only he had placed a different bet he
would have won’, or ‘if only he had been luckier’.
Individuals also feel better about bad outcomes when they
imagine how things could have been worse, e.g., ‘if he had
placed a higher bet he would have lost more money’ (e.g.,
Mandel, Hilton, & Catellani, 2005; Markman, Klein, &
Suhr, 2009). Counterfactual thinking may be goal directed,
designed to help people to achieve a better performance in
the future (Roese, Sanna, & Galinsky, 2005).
Participants in experiments display consistent regularities
in their construction of counterfactual thoughts (Byrne,
2005; Kahneman & Tversky, 1982). They tend to change
actions more than inactions (Byrne & McEleney, 2000;
Kahneman & Tversky, 1982; Landman & Petty, 2000); and
controllable events more than uncontrollable ones (Girotto,
Legrenzi, & Rizzo, 1991; Markman, Gavanski, Sherman, &
McMullen, 1995; McCloy & Byrne, 2000). Participants tend
to focus on exceptional events more so than on normal
events (Kahneman & Miller, 1986; Kahneman & Tversky,
1982). For example, when they read a story about an

individual who is killed in a car accident that occurred on a
route home from work that he rarely takes, participants tend
to think ‘if only he had taken his regular route’ (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1982). However, they tend to focus on the
exceptional action less often when they have been given a
good reason for it, for example, the individual took an
unusual route home in order to collect medicine for his sick
wife (Bonnefon, Zhang, & Deng, 2007; Walsh & Byrne,
2007).
In the two experiments we report in this paper, we
examined the tendency to change exceptional actions to be
normal in ‘if only’ thoughts. The aim of the experiments
was to test whether individuals change an exceptional action
to be normal even when an alternative exceptional action
would lead to a better outcome. We conjectured that people
are guided by the goal of creating a counterfactual
alternative that has a better outcome than the real one (for
details see Dixon & Byrne, 2009). Hence we predicted that
people would change an exceptional action to be an
alternative exceptional action when the alternative could
lead to a better outcome.
The experiments availed of a story about an actor placing
a bet in a card game (see Dixon & Byrne, 2009). The actor
is faced with three betting options: to place a small, medium
or large bet. Participants were told that the actor’s usual
behavior was to place a small bet (€10), and so the
alternative medium (€20) and large (€30) bets were
exceptional actions (see the Appendix for the full scenario).
In the versions of the story used in the two experiments, the
actor placed an exceptional large bet; in the version in the
first experiment he lost; in the version in the second
experiment he won.
They were also told that Peter only wins money if the
other players in the game decide to match the bet he makes.
Three opposition players were described who each use
distinct techniques: The small-bet player only plays small
bets, the medium-bet player plays small and medium bets,
and the large-bet player plays small, medium and large bets.
Participants were told that (a) if Peter places a small €10
bet, probably all three opposition players will match his bet
(Peter’s €10 matched by the small-bet player’s €10 + the
medium-bet player’s €10 + the large-bet player’s €10); (b) if
Peter places a medium €20 bet, probably only the mediumbet player and the large-bet player will match his bet
(Peter’s €20 matched by the medium-bet player’s €20 + the
large-bet player’s €20); and (c) if Peter places a large €30

bet, probably only the large-bet player will match his bet
(Peter’s €30 matched by the large-bet player’s €30). As the
scenario was based on a card game with the aim of winning
money, participants were able to make judgments about the
best and worst actions that the actor could take.
Participants were told the outcome of the game and their
task was to imagine Peter’s thoughts that ‘things could have
been different if….’ The aim of the two experiments was to
test the hypothesis that participants create ‘if only’ thoughts
that change an exceptional action (e.g., Peter placed a large
bet) to be like the usual action (if only he had placed his
usual small bet), only when an exceptional alternative (the
medium bet) would not lead to a better outcome; when the
exceptional alternative might lead to a better outcome, we
predicted they would change the exceptional action to be
like the exceptional alternative (if only he had placed the
medium bet).

Experiment 1
The experiment tested the hypothesis that participants create
‘if only’ thoughts that change an exceptional action (the
large bet) to be like the usual action (if only he had placed
his usual small bet), only when an exceptional alternative
(the medium bet) would not lead to a better outcome. The
version of the scenario used in the experiment described the
decision to place a large bet as follows:
Peter thought about his choices carefully. He considered
betting small, a bet of €10, as he usually does. He then
considered a medium bet of €20. Then Peter considered
the large bet - he decided to go with the large bet of €30.
Peter’s large bet meant that the small-bet player and the
medium-bet player decided not to play with him, so
neither the small-bet player nor the medium-bet player
placed a bet. So the large-bet player decided to play with
Peter by matching Peter’s bet of €30.
The outcome was described as follows:
The large-bet player had better cards than Peter, so the
large-bet player wins the game and receives €60 (The
large-bet player’s €30 + Peter’s €30 = €60).
In the scenario, the actor chooses an exceptional action
which, as we will see shortly, participants judge to be
unjustified (he places a large bet). There is an alternative
exceptional action, which participants judge is justified (the
medium bet) but it does not lead to a better outcome. We
predicted that the tendency to change the exceptional action
(the large bet) to be like the usual action (the small bet)
would occur even in the situation in which the exceptional
alternative (the medium bet) is considered to be the best,
justified action, given that the exceptional alternative would
not lead to a better outcome.
In this experiment the action and outcome can be
represented in the following diagram:

Action:
Outcome:

Actor places exceptional large bet
Large bet player plays:
Large bet player has better cards than
actor

The counterfactual alternative created by changing the
actor’s exceptional action to be like the usual action is as
follows:
Counterfactual Action:
Actor places usual small bet
Counterfactual Outcome:
Large, Medium and Small bet players play:
Large bet player has better cards than actor
The counterfactual alternative created by changing the
actor’s exceptional action to be like the other exceptional
action (placing the medium bet) is as follows:
Counterfactual Action:
Actor places exceptional medium bet
Counterfactual Outcome:
Large and Medium bet players play:
Large bet player has better cards than Actor
We predicted that participants w o u l d exhibit the
exceptionality effect, that is, they would create
counterfactual alternatives that focused on the usual action
(e.g., ‘if only he had placed his usual small bet he would
have lost considerably less’). The outcome of the game
identified that the large-bet player had better cards than the
actor. Therefore counterfactual thoughts that focus on the
other exceptional bet cannot result in a winning outcome (if
he had placed a medium bet he still would have lost, albeit
lost somewhat less, because the large bet player would still
have played). We predict that the tendency to say ‘if only he
had carried out his usual action’ will be observed in this
situation, because even though the alternative exceptional
action is justified (it is judged to be the best bet), it will not
lead to a better outcome.
We asked all participants to complete the sentence: ‘Peter
thinks to himself after the game, “Things could have been
different if…” after they learned of the outcome of the game.
Half of the participants were also required to think
strategically by being given the question ‘Explain what you
think is the best decision for Peter’ prior to being told about
the outcome. The control group of participants was not
given this question (and there were no other differences in
the two groups). In this way we examined whether
participants constructed different ‘if only’ thoughts when
they were required to think about the actor’s decisionmaking as well as the outcome (in the strategy group),
compared to when they were required to think about the
outcome only (in the control group) (Markman & Tetlock,
2000). All participants also answered the question: ‘What
size bet do you think Peter places?’ prior to being told about
the outcome.

Participants, design and procedure
Participants were assigned at random to two groups, the
control group and the strategy group (n = 30 in each group).
The 60 participants were undergraduates and postgraduates
from Trinity College Dublin who took part voluntarily.
They were given the scenario and the questions in a booklet
and they completed the questions at their own pace.

Results and discussion

explanation can be ruled out by participants’ judgments
about the best bets: very few participants judged that the
small bet was the best bet, even though they could calculate
that it would lead to the least amount of money lost.
The experiment also shows that prior thoughts about the
decision prompted by the question ‘Explain what you think
is the best decision for Peter’ asked of participants in the
strategy group resulted in their construction of different
counterfactual thoughts compared to the participants in the
control group. The differences are consistent with the idea
that people tend to focus on the outcome – the actor lost (in
the control group), but when they think about the actor’s
decision (in the strategy group), they think not only about
the outcome but also about the decision making process that
led to it (Markman & Tetlock, 2000).

The responses to the questions about what was the best
decision for Peter to make confirm that participants judged
the medium bet to be the best bet (80%) rather than the
small or large bet (20% and 0% respectively), as did their
judgments of what bet Peter would make (see Dixon &
Byrne, 2009 for further details).
As expected, the exceptional action was changed to be

In the strategy group, participants ‘if only’ thoughts did not
tend to focus frequently on either the small or the medium
bets (20% vs. 17%, χ 2= .091, df = 1, p = .760), as Table 1
also shows. Participants in the control group said ‘if only
he’d placed his usual small bet’ more than those in the
strategy group (50% vs. 20%, χ2= 3.86, df = 1, p = .050). In
contrast, participants in the strategy group focused on
factors other than the bets, such as ‘if only he hadn’t
played’, ‘if only he’d been luckier’ or ‘if only he had better
cards’ more than those in the control group (63% vs. 30%,
χ2= 3.57, df = 1, p = .059).
The experiment demonstrates the standard tendency for
‘if only’ thoughts to focus on a usual action (the small bet),
in the card game scenario for the control group. It shows the
effect occurs when participants chose an exceptional action
(the large bet), and an exceptional alternative (the medium
bet) would not lead to a better outcome, even though the
exceptional alternative was judged to be the best, justified
action.
An alternative explanation is that participants focus on the
small bet not because it is the usual action but because it
will lead to the least amount of money lost. However, this

The counterfactual alternative created by changing the
actor’s exceptional action to be like the usual action is as
follows:
Counterfactual Action:
Actor places usual small bet
Counterfactual Outcome:
Large, Medium and Small bet players play;
Actor has better cards than Large bet player
Unknown whether Actor has better cards than
Medium or Small bet players
The counterfactual alternative created by changing the
actor’s exceptional action to be like the other exceptional
action (placing the medium bet) is as follows:

2862

Counterfactual Action:
Actor places exceptional medium bet
Counterfactual Outcome:
Large and Medium bet players play;
Actor has better cards than Large bet player
Unknown whether Actor has better cards than
Medium bet player
The counterfactual outcome from the exceptional alternative
is less uncertain (it is unknown whether the actor has better
cards than just one other player, the medium bet player) than
that from the usual action (it is unknown whether the actor
has better cards than two other players, both the medium bet
player and the small bet player). Accordingly, the actor
could have won even more money, €40 rather than €30
profit - if he had placed a medium bet and won. The good
outcome allows us to compare counterfactual outcomes of
differing degrees of uncertainty.
Participants, design and procedure
Participants were assigned at random to the control group
and the strategy group (n = 36 in each). The 72 participants
were undergraduates and postgraduates from Trinity
College Dublin who took part voluntarily. The design and
procedure were the same as the previous experiment.

Results and discussion
As expected, participants ‘if only’ thoughts focused more
often on the exceptional alternative, ‘if only he placed the
medium bet’. Most of these participants imagined that the
medium bet would bring about a better outcome.
Participants focused on the exceptional medium bet more
than the usual small bet in the control group (53% vs. 19%,
χ2= 5.54, df = 1, p = .019), as Table 2 shows.

Participants focused equally on the exceptional medium bet
and the usual small bet in the strategy group (33% vs. 17%,
χ2= 2.00, df = 1, p = .157). There were no differences in
their focus on the medium bet in the strategy group and the
control group (33% vs. 53%, χ2= 1.58, df = 1, p = .209).
Participants in both groups focused on the bets more than
non-bet factors (control: 78% vs. 22%, χ2= 11.11, df = 1, p
< .001; strategy: 64% vs. 36%, χ2= 2.78, df = 1, p = .096).

Both betting alternatives lead to uncertain counterfactual
outcomes, but the exceptional alternative (the medium bet)
leads to less uncertainty than the usual action and so
participants tend to create ‘if only’ thoughts that change the
exceptional action to be like the exceptional alternative.

General Discussion
In the two experiments reported in this paper the actor chose
an exceptional unjustified action (the large bet). In
Experiment 1 the unjustified exceptional action led to a bad
outcome. Participants focused on the usual action (the small
bet) when the exceptional justified alternative (the medium
bet) would not have led to a better outcome. The result
shows that the goal of creating counterfactual alternatives
with a better outcome takes precedence over the influence of
the justification for the action (cf Bonnefon et al, 2007). In
Experiment 2, the unjustified exceptional action led to a
good outcome. Participants focused on the exceptional
alternative rather than the usual action when they could
create a counterfactual alternative in which the outcome
might have been even better. Further research shows that the
results extend also to situations in which the actor chooses
an exceptional justified action (the medium bet) (see Dixon
& Byrne, 2009 for details).
The experiments also revealed differences between the
strategy group, who were asked to think about the best bet
prior to knowing the outcome, and the control group, who
were not. Experiment 1 showed that participants in the
strategy group focused their ‘if only’ thoughts on factors
unrelated to the bet placed, such as ‘if only he had been
luckier’, or ‘if only he had better cards’, unlike the control
group who focused on the usual small bet. Prior thinking
about the best decision led participants in the strategy group
to shift their focus from the alternative bets. Experiment 2
showed that participants in the strategy group did not focus
on the medium bet to the same extent as participants in the
control group did.
In summary the experiments provide evidence that people
think about the counterfactual outcome (the potential for the
outcome to have been different) and calibrate the focus of
their counterfactual ‘if only’ thoughts to change only those
antecedents that could have led to a different outcome. They
do not change an exceptional action to be like the usual
action if the usual action would not have led to a better
outcome (see Kahneman & Tversky, 1982; Kahneman &
Miller, 1986). They do not change an exceptional action to
be like a justified action, if the justified action would not
have led to a better outcome (see Bonnefon et al, 2007). The
results provide support for the idea that the different
possibilities people think about when they create
counterfactual alternatives are guided by a small set of
principles (Byrne, 2005; 2007). For example, people tend to
think about true possibilities and they tend to think about
few possibilities (Byrne & Johnson-Laird, 2009; JohnsonLaird & Byrne, 2002). The results also support the idea that
the counterfactual alternatives that people create are goal
directed (Roese et al, 2000; Byrne, 1997; 2005).

Appendix
The card game story
Peter is faced with a dilemma when playing a game of
cards. The cards given to him give him a great chance of
winning the game, and with that, a great chance of
winning money. Peter alone knows the values of the cards
he holds. However Peter can only win money if the other
players in the game decide to play with Peter by matching
the bet he makes. If none of the other players decide to
play with Peter by betting, all the players will surrender
their cards and receive new cards. Peter knows new cards
will probably not give him such a great chance of
winning.
Peter has good cards. Peter usually places a small bet.
However there are actually three choices available to
Peter. Peter can bet small, medium, or large. These three
values are related to how much money Peter is willing to
bet in the game.
Peter is playing with three other players who each use
three separate and distinct techniques for playing the

game. These techniques have earned them the names of
The Mouse, The Lion, and The Jackal. The Mouse only
plays small bets, the Lion plays small and medium bets,
and the Jackal plays small, medium and large bets. Each
of the players’ individual techniques means that they will
each respond differently to Peter’s betting actions.
Peter’s cards are very good. However how much Peter
bets has consequences. Betting small, medium or large
will affect the reactions of the three opposition players in
different manners, as follows:
If Peter bets small, his bet will be €10. This will result in
probably all three opposition players matching his bet.
(Peter’s €10 matched by Mouse’s €10 + Lion’s €10 +
Jackal’s €10)
If Peter bets medium, his bet will be €20. This will result
in probably only the Lion and the Jackal matching his bet.
(Peter’s €20 matched by Lion’s €20 + Jackal’s €20)
If Peter bets large, his bet will be €30. This will result in
probably only the Jackal matching his bet.
(Peter’s €30 matched by + Jackal’s €30).
