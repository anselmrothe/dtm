Availability of counterexample and acceptance of causal conditional
inference

Abstract: Studies of causal conditional inference showed that acceptance of the inference decreased when reasoner
found the counterexample of the inference. This study investigated how availability of counterexample affected
causal conditional inference. In experiments, participants read the stories contained conditional inference statement
and judged validity of the inference. Half of the experimental stories explicitly mentioned counterexample of the
conditional inference in order to manipulate availability of the counterexample. Results indicated that acceptance
of inference was decreased and reaction time of judgment was accelerated when story explicitly mentioned counter
example of the inference. Therefore, available information of counterexample affected causal conditional inference
by facilitated and shortening the counterexample search.
