Abstract: This study investigated the psycholonguistic debates of serial and parallel models in language produc-
tion by an nonalphabetic language, Mandarin Chinese. Two event-related potential (ERP) components were used
to explore the time course of semantic and phonological encoding during implicit picture naming in Chinese. The
lateralized readiness potential (LRP) and N200 were presumbly related to repsonse preparation and response in-
hibition.Participants were shown the pictures and made dual choice go/nogo decisions based on semantic features
(whether the depicted items were animate or inanimate) and phonological features (whether the Chinese names of
the depicted items were composed of one or two characters). The results showed that the pick latencies of the N200
were signicantly earlier in the hand = semantics condition than in the hand = character condition. Therefore, the
results suggst a serial processing model of language production in Mandarin Chinese, and they provide more complete
understanding of language processing.
