answers that she checks off as the subject performs the task.
Immediately before the task begins the experimenter
emphasizes that the task should be preformed as quickly and
as accurately as possible. The subjects’ subtraction answers
are scored against the list of correct answers from the starting
number. For each subject the number of subtraction problem
attempts are recorded and a percentage correct score is
calculated by dividing the total number of correct attempts by
the total number of attempts for each block of the serial
subtraction.

Abstract
A fine-grained analysis of errors and their frequency during the
performance of a mental multi-digit serial subtraction task
reveals the cognitive processes most prone to failure. Example
serial subtraction problems from the experimental problem set
are utilized in illustrating different types of errors and their
probable causes. A list of considerations is presented for future
descriptive and computational modeling of the errors
committed during performance of the task.
Keywords: Cognitive arithmetic, Serial subtraction; Errors

Introduction
Mental multi-digit serial subtraction under time pressure,
performed and evaluated in front of an audience, can easily
overwhelm the working memory resources of human
subjects. A fine-grained analysis of the human performance
produced several categories of errors: subtracting a value
more than the subtrahend, subtracting a value less then the
subtrahend, and adding instead of subtracting. These error
types were decomposed by probable causes—combinations of
retrieval and procedural failures. Dissection of example serial
subtraction problems associated with the error types revealed
the cognitive processes in the solution process prone to
failure. Lessons learned from this detailed level of error
analysis can inform the construction of descriptive and
computational cognitive models of serial subtraction.

subtraction task as in the experiment; subjects perform the
task mentally without paper or visual cues.

Serial Subtraction

Human Performance

Serial subtraction is the mental arithmetic stressor portion of
the Trier Social Stressor Test (TSST, Kirschbaum, Pirke &
Hellhammer, 1993). The TSST has been used to provide an
acute physiological stress response in human subjects in
100’s of studies since the 1960’s. The serial subtraction task
consists of four 4-minute blocks of mentally subtracting by 7
and 13 from 4-digit starting numbers. Figure 1 illustrates the
serial subtraction task with the four starting numbers for each
subtraction block shaded in gray. The task is performed
mentally with no visual or paper clues. An experimenter gives
the subject the starting number; from then on, the subject
speaks the answer to each subtraction problem.
Before the task begins, the experimenter explains that the
subject’s performance is going to be voice recorded and
reviewed by a panel of psychologists. Subjects sit in a chair
directly in front and near the experimenter who is holding a
time keeping device and clipboard of the correct subtraction

In this study the serial subtraction performance data from 15
subjects (age range, 18-30) in the control group were
analyzed at two levels: as a group and individually (Kase,
2008). The statistics of primary interest were number of
attempts and percentage correct for each block of serial
subtraction. Additionally, the audio recordings of each
subject were transcribed to obtain data on subtraction pace
and detailed information about errors. Table 1 shows the
subtraction rates averaged across subjects’ performance on
the two 4-minute blocks of subtracting by 7, and Table 2 for
subtracting by 13. The large standard deviations indicate that
there is a wide range of performance on this task.
In Tables 1 and 2 number of errors are represented as
number of incorrect attempts. Subjects sometimes answered a
particular subtraction problem incorrectly more than once. In
this case each of these incorrect attempts was counted as an

& LeFevre, 2004). When a cognitive task places extreme
demands on working memory, accuracy and processing speed
may decrease (Ashcraft, 1992). The errors subjects make
while performing complex arithmetic, such as serial
subtraction, are critical evidence about the underlying
cognitive processes required to perform the task. The errors
committed by the subjects during their performance of the
serial subtraction task are discussed next.

A novel approach is utilized in the categorization of the
errors. The subjects are attempting to subtract by 7 or 13.
When subjects give an incorrect answer we categorize the
error as to mathematical operator (– or +) and subtrahend
value that would have produced the erroneous answer.
Table 3 shows two example problems with their error
categorization. The first column shows a serial subtraction
problem. The second column contains a subject’s incorrect
answer to the problem. The third column describes the error
category, for example, “subtraction by 17 error”; because the
incorrect answer would be produced by subtracting 17 from
the minuend (9039). It is important to remember that this is a
method to categorize and discuss particular types of errors
associated with serial subtraction, and does not mean that the
subject intended to subtract by 17 instead of 7. Likewise, the
second row in Table 3 describes the error category “addition
by 3 error” where the incorrect answer would be produced by
adding 3 to the minuend (9046).

error even though the incorrect attempts were associated with
the same subtraction problem. The next section describes the
serial subtraction solution process in general, as well as,
working memory’s role in mathematical processing.

Solving the Problem
Fluent performance on complex cognitive tasks, such as the
serial subtraction task, relies on the ability to coordinate and
integrate stored information with ongoing processes. This
requires efficient organization and maintenance of
intermediate results that can be accessed for use at the
appropriate time. For example, to solve the problem 5964 – 7
requires the subject to mentally retain both operands in
memory while processing the following steps. Compare the
units-column minuend (4) with the subtrahend (7) to
determine if a borrow operation is required; if so, decrement
the tens-column minuend by one (i.e., from 6 to 5) and retain
this decremented value in memory while performing the
units-column operations. The units-column operations
involve encoding the values, performing an addition by
adding 10 to the units-column minuend (i.e., 4 + 10 = 14)
calculating the units-column difference (i.e., 14 – 7 = 7); and
then retaining this partial solution in memory. The final
answer is re-constructed from the thousands- and hundredscolumn values retained from the original minuend (i.e., 59)
concatenated with the two previous partial solutions, the
decremented value of the tens-column (i.e., 5), and unitscolumn solution (i.e., 7).
For this investigation we adopt the view that mathematical
cognition involves working memory—referenced as
"memory" in the previous example. Working memory is
generally defined as the preservation of information while
simultaneously processing the same or other information
(Salthouse & Babcock, 1991). An important concept of
working memory is that working memory capacity is limited
(Baddeley, 1986). Researchers have emphasized the
importance of working memory for understanding
mathematical processing (Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001; DeStefano

Using the above error categorization, frequencies of errors
by the subjects when subtracting by 7 and 13 are broken
down in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 lists the errors and
frequencies when subjects subtracted by 7. The table is
divided into three main sections. The center section lists
summary frequencies. When subtracting by 7 for two 4minute blocks the subjects made a total of 1511 subtraction
attempts, 1346 correct responses, and 165 errors. The error
percentage is 10.9% with 56 of the errors categorized as
additions (see second example, Table 3), and 107 of the errors
categorized as subtractions other than by 7 (see first example,
Table 3). Two errors occurred when the minuend of a
subtraction problem was given as the answer. The leftmost
section of Table 4 categorizes errors of subtraction that are
more than 7. Errors with a frequency greater than 3 are listed
individually; remaining errors with lower frequency are
grouped under Other. For example, on the left side of Table 4
under the Value Subtracted column, the value –17 is listed
with a frequency of 7 and 0.5%. This means that the

1552

subtraction by 17 error occurred 7 times which is 0.5% of the
total errors. The rightmost section of Table 4 lists subtraction
errors that are less than 7, and addition errors, both with
frequencies greater than 3. For example, the first value in the
right Value Subtracted column shows the subtraction by 6
error occurred 25 times accounting for 1.7% of the total
errors. Midway down in the right Value Subtracted column,
12 errors are categorized as the addition by 93 error (+93) for
0.8% of the total errors.

Table 5 is similar in format to Table 4 and lists the
subtraction by 13 errors and frequencies. When subtracting
by 13 for two 4-minute blocks the subjects made a total of
1306 subtraction attempts (205 less than the subtraction by 7
attempts), with 1141 correct responses, and 165 errors (same
number of errors as subtraction by 7). The error percentage is
12.6% compared to 10.9% when subtracting by 7. Of the 165
errors 131 of the errors were categorized as subtractions other
than 13, and 33 of the errors were categorized as additions (a
smaller percentage than subtracting by 7, 13.9% less).

Error Types
The performance of cognitive arithmetic tasks requires
accessible representations of information specific to the
problem (i.e., elementary subtraction or addition facts) as
well as efficient procedures enabling the problem solving
process (i.e., counting, carry, and borrow) (Ashcraft, 1992;
Cocchini, Logie, Della Sala, MacPherson, & Baddeley,
2002). The next two sections discuss the errors listed in
Tables 4 and 5 in reference to their retrieval and procedural
causes.

Fact Retrieval Errors
Generally, errors were most frequently clustered around the
intended subtrahend. For example, during subtraction by 7
over one third of the total errors resulted from subtraction
by 8, 6, and 5 errors (see Table 4). These types of errors

accounted for 70 of the 165 total errors, or 42%. Likewise a
similar pattern is observed during subtraction by 13,
subtraction by 14, 12, and 11 errors, accounted for 37 of the
165 errors, or 22%, almost a quarter of the total errors.
In the cognitive arithmetic literature, errors involving
answers that would be correct if one of the operands were
changed by ±1 are typically called ‘near errors’ (Ashcraft,
1992). This type of error is thought to be caused by a fact
retrieval failure. For example, when subtracting by 7, the
units-column operation involves a simple number fact (i.e.,
9 – 7). These simple subtractions, would rely heavily on fact
retrieval from long-term memory (Ashcraft & Battaglia,
1978; Widaman, Geary, Cormier, & Little, 1989). Subjects
skilled in arithmetic would have memory representations of
arithmetic facts that specify the result of applying a
mathematical operator (i.e., – or +) to particular operands
(e.g., the fact 9 – 7 = 2). The problem elements, operator
and operand symbols, serve the role as retrieval cues

1553

(Siegler & Shrager, 1984). The retrieval process might
begin only when a subject has encoded all of the problem’s
elements. Alternatively, the retrieval process might begin
earlier on the basis of partial cues provided by individual
problem elements (Campbell, 1994). Near errors may be the
result of an incorrect partial match on one of the operands
near in the counting sequence to the intended subtrahend.
For example, when subtracting by 7 under time pressure, the
subject might easily retrieve the 9 – 6 = 3 fact instead of the
9 – 7 = 2 fact.
Another explanation of fact retrieval errors is the
phenomenon called error priming. Campbell (1991) found
that errors frequently match the correct answer to a problem
solved earlier in the experimental session. In some cases a
recently used subtraction fact might be more active in
working memory than the fact that needs to be used in the
current subtraction problem resulting in an incorrect fact
retrieval.
In general, direct retrieval of arithmetic facts is thought to
utilize little working memory as the operands and operator
are encoded and the solution quickly retrieved. This is not
the case for more complex subtractions requiring a borrow
operation, or multi-digit minuends and subtrahends where a
mixture of fact retrieval and procedural operations are
needed to solve the problem.

the x-axis. The top two plots compare the error rate when
subtracting by 7 (upper left) and subtracting by 13 (upper
right). The bottom two plots compare the mean reaction
time in seconds when subtracting by 7 (bottom left) and 13
(bottom right). The upward sloping lines in all the plots
indicate that the procedural complexity of performing a
borrow operation increases both the error rate and mean
reaction time most likely by placing a greater demand on
working memory during the problem solving process.

Procedural Errors
Research on multi-digit arithmetic problems supports the
view that working memory is related to the number of steps
required to solve problems—more steps require more
working memory resources (Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001; Fürst &
Hitch, 2000). These studies found that errors, especially
those attributable to working memory failures, were most
frequent at points in the problem solving process where the
demands for retaining intermediate results were highest.
Salthouse (1992) and Hitch (1978) described the borrow
operation as an in-context working memory manipulation.
Therefore, we would expect working memory demands to
be greater for serial subtraction problems requiring a borrow
(e.g., 8101 – 7) than for non-borrow problems (e.g., 8157 –
7).
Over half (57%) of the serial subtraction problems used in
the experimental problem set required a borrow operation in
the calculation of the solution. Broken down by subtrahend:
70% of the subtraction by 7 problems required a borrow,
and 37.4% of the subtraction by 13 problems required a
borrow. Several of the serial subtraction problems required
more than one borrow as shown in Table 6. The 1 Borrow
column in Table 6 shows the number of problems that
required one borrow operation in calculating the solution.
The 3 Borrow column shows that two of the subtraction by
7 and three of the subtraction by 13 problems required three
borrow operations to solve.
Figure 2 confirms that a borrow operation increases both
error rate and mean reaction time when subtracting by 7 and
13 during the four 4-minute blocks of serial subtraction. The
No Borrow and Borrow problem categories are shown on

Figure 2: Borrow operation effects on error rate and mean
reaction time for subtraction by 7 and 13.
The borrow operation and its utilization of working
memory capacity appears to contribute to the misreporting
of intermediate results and digits in the minuend yet to be
processed. Borrow-inducted errors may involve, for
instance, forgetting the thousands- or hundreds-column
values during the processing of a lower-order borrow; or
forgetting the tens-column digit of the subtrahend while
adding 10 to the units-column as first step in the borrow
operation; or forgetting to complete the last step of the
borrow operation with the decrement of one. Misreporting
intermediate results may also stem from placekeeping
failures such as retrieving the wrong intermediary result at
specific points in the problem calculation, or recalculating
the same column twice, or skipping over a column

1554

calculation. Specific problem instances related to these
misreporting errors are discussed in the next section.

Example Errors
Tables 4 and 5 listed categories of errors resulting from
subtractions other than the subtrahend and from additions.
The retrieval and procedural causes discussed in the
previous sections are applied to individual example
problems pulled from these tables.
In Table 4, the addition-of-93 error and the addition-of893 error occurred 17 times across subjects. With a 4-digit
minuend, the value of the thousands- and hundreds-columns
must be maintained in working memory waiting processing.
These values can be forgotten during the processing of the
tens- and units-column calculations. Figure 3 shows
example problems associated with the misreporting of the
hundreds-column resulting in the addition-of-93 error, and
example problems associated with transposing the
hundreds- and thousands-column values resulting in the
addition-of-893 error.

The bottom of Figure 3 shows the four problems
generating the addition-of-893 error. In most of these
problems the thousands- and hundreds-column values of 8
and 9 were erroneously transposed. The problems all
required a units-column borrow operation. The addition-of893 error also appeared when the hundreds-column value of
1 was involved in a borrow. In this case, the hundredscolumn value of the erroneous answer was misreported as 9
instead of the correctly decremented value of 0 after two
borrow operations.
Table 5 contains the subtraction-of-3, subtraction-of-23,
and the addition-of-87 error categories. These three types of
errors accounted for 64 errors across subjects’ performance.
Example problems associated with each of these error types
are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Example subtraction-of-13 problems associated
with the subtraction-of-3, subtraction-of-23, and the
addition-of-87 errors.

The addition-of-93 error occurred with seven different
subtraction problems. The top of Figure 3 shows six of the
seven problems. Four of these problems were missed more
than once across subjects (labeled with Frequency Missed).
Interestingly, six of the seven problems appear as part of a
3-problem sequence in serial subtraction (labeled Sequence,
denoted with a wide gray line). Four of the seven problems
required a units-column borrow operation. The subjects’
erroneous answers (labeled Error) commonly misreport the
hundreds-column value by plus one with the increment
either from 7 to 8, or 8 to 9, nearby in the counting sequence
to the subtrahend (near error). Surprisingly, nearly all of the
minuends contained at least two 8s usually accompanied by
a 9 or 7. This type of error could result from a combination
of retrieval and procedure causes: high operand activation
for values near in sequence to the subtrahend with low-order
borrow-induced forgetting of the higher-order digits.

The top of Figure 4 shows five example problems
associated with the subtraction-of-3 error. This type of error
had the highest overall frequency (34) of all the subtraction
errors. Generally described, the subtraction-of-3 error is a
misreporting of the tens-column value by plus one. The
majority of the time (73.5%) the error involved a borrow
from the tens-column. After a correct subtraction of the
units-column, either the decrement of the tens-column
borrow is forgotten or, in the case of no borrow, the 1 in the
tens-column of the subtrahend (13) appears to be ignored.
Similar to the subtraction-of-3 error, the subtraction-of-23
error involved the misreporting of the tens-column by minus
one. Example problems are shown in the middle of Figure 4.
Surprisingly, 14 of the 15 problems causing this error did
not require a borrow operation. The units- and tens-column
calculations should have been accomplished with simple

1555

columnar fact retrievals making for some of the easiest
subtraction problems in the experimental series. It is
possible that after the units-column subtraction fact was
retrieved, that a near error occurred during the fact retrieval
for the tens-column processing (i.e., –2 instead of –1 of the
subtrahend), or that the simple subtraction of the 1 is
performed a second time as if the subject loses his place and
performs that column’s subtraction again.
The bottom of Figure 4 shows example addition-of-87
errors caused by misreporting the hundreds-column value by
an erroneous increment of one. About half of the 15
problems associated with this error were difficult in that
they required a hundreds-column borrow, or a tens-column
borrow, and sometimes appeared in a sequence. In the case
of no borrow, the hundreds-column value only needed to be
carried down to the solution. The previous intermediate
result from subtracting the 1 in the tens-column of 13 may
be activated and still in working memory promoting an
erroneous increment of 1 to the hundreds-column value.

Conclusion
Little previous research is available on understanding the
cognitive processes required to solve complex multi-digit
subtraction problems (e.g., Geary, Frensch, & Wiley, 1993),
and no previous research specifically addresses solving
mental serial subtraction. The following list summarizes the
most important findings of this serial subtraction error
analysis. Individually, each of these findings has been
reported in various simple arithmetic tasks. Here we see that
combinations of retrieval and procedural failures contribute
to an incorrect serial subtraction attempt. These findings
provide useful information to cognitive arithmetic
researchers. We believe that the present analysis represents
progress toward a general, predictive theory of serial
subtraction and its performance errors by noting several of
the most common types.
1. Fact retrieval errors: (a) Retrieving a fact near in value
to the subtrahend. (b) Incorrect retrieval based on a partial
match to a common value in the minuend. (c) Retrieving an
activated fact from a previously calculated column.
2. Errors induced by a borrow: (a) Misreporting of higherorder minuend values. (b) Forgetting the tens-column digit
of the subtrahend, after executing a borrow. (c) Errors
within the borrow operation itself, depending on location of
the borrow, forgetting the tens-column value while
executing the unit-columns addition of 10 and fact retrieval,
and (d) forgetting to decrement the tens-column value in
completing the borrow.
