                          Introduction
Mental multi-digit serial subtraction under time pressure,
performed and evaluated in front of an audience, can easily
overwhelm the working memory resources of human
subjects. A fine-grained analysis of the human performance
produced several categories of errors: subtracting a value
more than the subtrahend, subtracting a value less then the
subtrahend, and adding instead of subtracting. These error
types were decomposed by probable causes—combinations of
retrieval and procedural failures. Dissection of example serial
subtraction problems associated with the error types revealed
the cognitive processes in the solution process prone to
failure. Lessons learned from this detailed level of error                    Figure 1: An illustration of the four blocks of the serial

   In general, direct retrieval of arithmetic facts is thought to
utilize little working memory as the operands and operator
are encoded and the solution quickly retrieved. This is not
the case for more complex subtractions requiring a borrow
operation, or multi-digit minuends and subtrahends where a
mixture of fact retrieval and procedural operations are
needed to solve the problem.
Procedural Errors
Research on multi-digit arithmetic problems supports the
view that working memory is related to the number of steps
required to solve problems—more steps require more
working memory resources (Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001; Fürst &
Hitch, 2000). These studies found that errors, especially
those attributable to working memory failures, were most
frequent at points in the problem solving process where the
demands for retaining intermediate results were highest.
Salthouse (1992) and Hitch (1978) described the borrow
operation as an in-context working memory manipulation.
Therefore, we would expect working memory demands to
be greater for serial subtraction problems requiring a borrow
(e.g., 8101 – 7) than for non-borrow problems (e.g., 8157 –
7).                                                                     Figure 2: Borrow operation effects on error rate and mean
