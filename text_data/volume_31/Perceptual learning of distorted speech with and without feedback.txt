Abstract: Adjusting to idiosyncrasies of individual speakers and dialects is necessary for spoken language compre-
hension. We investigated adult listeners perceptual learning using sinewave-vocoded speech as a model of adapting
to distortions of the acoustic speech signal. The degree of perceptual learning elicited by feedback-driven training
is equivalent to a training paradigm with no external feedback, but for which the severity of the acoustic distortion
is incremented gradually. We hypothesize that the learning observed in these two conditions may engage distinct
mechanisms differentially reliant on external feedback versus internally-generated error signals. As predicted from
this perspective, exposure to severe acoustic distortions without external feedback does not result in learning. Incre-
mental introduction of acoustic distortions may elicit an internal error signal that adjusts the mapping from acoustic
signal to lexical item whereas abrupt introduction of a severe distortion may fail to elicit error signals necessary to
drive learning.
