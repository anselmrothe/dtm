Abstract: We present an overview of our computer model of music perception and expectation. This model, called
”Musicat” (after Mitchell and Hofstadter’s ”Copycat”) extends to a musical domain the Active Symbols Architecture
used in projects such as Copycat. Musicat models the dynamic experience of listening as music unfolds through time.
Specifically, given a symbolically-represented input melody, Musicat simulates the process of listening to the music
one note at a time, generating and revising internal higher-level representations of the input as it is presented.
Musicat’s model of perceptual simulation groups notes together, perceives relations between groups, and extracts
repeating musical motifs. The model’s internal representations also give rise to expectations about upcoming notes,
and such expectations can be used to compare the model with human subjects. We discuss ongoing improvements
to the model, informed by both successful and less-successful examples of Musicat’s output when given Western
folk-style melodies as input.
