if the sentence mentioned the causal agent in a transitive
sentence that described the change-of-state event. A
canonical agentive description would be “He popped the
balloon”. Descriptions were coded as non-agentive if the
change-of-state event was described intransitively. A
canonical non-agentive description would be “The balloon
popped”. In Japanese, non-agentive descriptions were
characterized by an intransitive verb as well as the particle
“ga” with the affected object (e.g., 「風船が割れてびっくり
した。」 , Balloon-ga popped-intransitive was surprised).
Some non-agentive descriptions in each language took the
form “Someone was doing X and then Y happened”, in
which the agent was linguistically separated from a change-
of-state event that was described intransitively.                  Figure 2: Within-language variation in accident descriptions.
