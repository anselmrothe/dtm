Abstract: Harmonic priming is responding to harmonically expected (tonic) chords faster than unexpected (sub-
dominant) chords (Bigand & Pineau, 1997). The Stroop effect, naming the color of a color-word slower when the color
and the word conflict, has been shown to be related to the ability of maintaining task goals in the face of competition
from habit (Cohen, Dunbar, & McClelland, 1990). In the current study, we hypothesized that individuals who
perform better at the Stroop task would show reduced harmonic priming, since they would be better at inhibiting
the effects of habitual expectancy that cause harmonic priming. The results were consistent with our hypothesis, in
that, we observed positive correlation between harmonic priming and the Stroop effect (r(60) = .30, p ¡ .05). Results
were discussed in relation to the effects of attentional mechanisms on harmonic priming.
