Abstract
Limitations seen in dual-task situations have commonly been
explained in terms of theories characterized by three discrete
stages of information processing (i.e. cognitive bottleneck
theory). We take a neural dynamic approach to understanding
how the cognitive system processes stimuli within the
psychological refractory period paradigm and propose that a
capacity limited stage of processing emerges as the natural
result of settling competition among presented stimuli as they
move from perceptual processing into cognitive stages of
processing. Using a new action dynamics methodology,
participants respond to stimuli via a Nintendo Wii remotecontrolled cursor. Competition within the cognitive system is
manifested in the subtle motor movements associated with the
trajectories of the participants’ responses. It was found that
more competition is manifested when stimuli are presented at
smaller SOAs than with larger ones and that inhibition is
manifested with the larger SOAs.
Keywords: Coordination dynamics; dual-task; competition;
psychological refractory period; bottleneck.

Background
Rapidly processing competing stimuli, such as a car cutting
you off in traffic as your cell phone rings, is accomplished
by the cognitive system via complex nested bouts of
perception and action that are coordinated in order to make
appropriate decisions. One of the most well known
experimental paradigms developed to probe limitations in
dual-task paradigms, derived from competing stimuli
presented in close temporal proximity, is the psychological
refractory period (PRP) paradigm (Welford, 1952).
In the typical PRP design, participants are presented with
two stimuli separated by varying stimulus onset
asynchronies (SOAs). Usually, a visual stimulus (S1) is
followed by an auditory stimulus (S2). Response order is
often enforced and participants are instructed to respond to
each stimulus by pressing arbitrary keys on a keyboard. The
combination of S1 and its response (R1) is referred to as
task 1 (T1). The presentation of S2 and its response (R2) is
referred to as task 2 (T2). The archetypal finding is that as
SOA decreases, and T1 and T2 are thus initiated very close
together, RT2 increases (Jentzsch, Leuthold, & Ulrich,
2007; Johnston & McCann, 2006; Ruthruff & Pashler, 2001;
Welford, 1952). In other words, the reaction time to T2 is
longer in PRP experiments than if T2 were to be completed
in isolation.
The cognitive bottleneck theory (CBT) is a commonly
accepted theory that attempts to explain the slowing of RT2
(Brisson, & Jolicoeur, 2007; Jentzsch, Leuthold, & Ulrich,
2007; Johnston & McCann, 2006; Sigman & Dehaene,
2006; Vachon & Tremblay, 2006). The CBT posits that
information processing resulting in a response requires three

discrete stages. The first stage is responsible for perceptual
processing, the second stage consists of central operations
(e.g., linking of stimulus-response mappings), and the third
stage deals with the motor response. The CBT states that the
first and third stages can proceed in parallel. However, the
second stage is characterized by a passive first-come, firstserved serial processor. Therefore, if S2 is presented before
S1 has been completely processed by the second stage, S2
must wait for S1 to exit this central stage of processing. For
many simple tasks, shortening the SOA to less than 300 ms
forces S2 to wait for access to the central processor (Sigman
& Dehaene, 2008). This waiting for access to the second
stage of processing is thought to be what causes the delayed
response times for T2.
However, another approach to explaining RT2 slowing is
the idea of dynamic competition. One such model has been
proposed by Potter, Staub, and O’Connor (2002) to explain
limitations in the attentional blink (AB) paradigm. A
notable number of authors have highlighted the similarities
between PRP and AB (Corallo, Sackur, Dehaene, &
Sigman, 2008; Jolicoeur, 1999; Ruthruff & Pashler, 2001;
Wong, 2002). Because of these similarities, it is reasonable
to postulate that Potter et al.’s (2002) model could be
extrapolated to explain the findings commonly seen in the
PRP paradigm. The important difference in the Potter et al.
(2002) model from the CBT is that stimuli compete for
entrance into a limited capacity stage of processing in an
active manner. For example, if S2 is presented before S1
enters the capacity limited stage of processing, the two
stimuli will compete for the limited processing resources.
Therefore, S2 may be able to “pull” processing resources
away from S1.
The competition seen in Potter et al.’s (2002) model
follows intuitively from neural dynamic approaches to
vision and attention, such as Desimone and Duncan’s
(1995) biased-competition model of visual attention. Instead
of a central executive, or spotlight, directing attention
around the visual field, their biased competition model
purports that attention is an end result of settling
representational competition. Desimone and Duncan (1995)
suggest that the cognitive system is confronted with
competition numerous times between stimulus presentation
and the motor response to that stimulus. As each stage of
visual processing is traversed the processing becomes more
complex and the amount of the visual field a neuron is
responsible for increases. As this occurs the stimuli that
were presented in those areas must compete with each other
for processing resources. Whichever stimulus continually
wins the competition for the limited processing resources is
the stimulus that is attended to. In this way Potter et al.’s
(2002) competition model can be seen as the natural

3052

consequence of this competition taking place within the
cognitive system at the lowest and most basic levels of
information processing as described by Desimone and
Duncan (1995).
Taking cognitive competition into consideration is an
improvement on the CBT; however, the limitation that both
Potter et al.’s (2002) model and the CBT have in common is
that they assume that information processing occurs in three
discrete, independently operating stages. These models
presume that motor commands cannot be programmed until
a stimulus has been completely processed by the central
operations stage. Given studies on decision-making and
motor programming (e.g., Gold & Shadlen, 2000), this
assumption is inherently flawed because it portrays the
cognitive system as an assembly line, when is better
described as an interconnected network of subsystems that
perform their individual duties under the influence of
continuous updates from these subsystems. Even if CBT is a
powerful explanatory account of PRP effects, it must itself
be accounted for in terms of emergent properties of
cognition and action, in which motor movements
materialize as information processing emerges from a
continuous coordination of the various subsystems within
the cognitive system working in concert (McKinstry, Dale,
Spivey 2008; Dale, Roche, Snyder, McCall, 2008). In other
words, the central processing of a stimulus and the motor
response stages of processing are not mutually exclusive but
are, in fact, dynamically linked.
In virtually all dual-task paradigm studies, reaction time is
the principle measure used to assess the effects of
competition within the cognitive system. In the present
work, we hope to contribute to the theoretical debate by
considering an action-dynamics methodology that provides
a finer-grained detection of cognitive competition than just
reaction time alone. In what follows, we summarize this
methodology, and describe two experiments using it.

Current Study
The purpose of the experiments presented in this paper is to
explore the implicit predictions of the CBT and the
competition-based approaches within PRP by tracking the
continuous flow of cognition into action. The CBT implies
that while the cognitive system is processing a stimulus it
cannot process anything else until that stimulus has been
completely processed. According to the alternative
approaches, there should be a level of competition even
during the post-perceptual processing that is typically
associated with the CBT approach. In this way, entrance
into a limited capacity stage of processing is an active and
dynamic process that, we propose, should be manifested as
the response unfolds over time.
These assumptions were investigated by way of the basic
PRP paradigm. However, instead of arbitrary key presses to
indicate responses, participants responded to stimuli using a
Nintendo Wii remote. This methodology provides a rich
source of arm-movement data that provides insights into the

dynamics of cognitive processing (Spivey, Grosjean, &
Knoblich, 2005; Dale, Kehoe, & Spivey, 2007).
By allowing participants’ to use the Nintendo Wii remote
to respond to a cognitive task, Dale et al. (2008) have found
that analyses of participants’ arm movement trajectories
reflect the mental processes that enabled the response. The
participants’ subtle motor movements within response
trajectories are recorded in order to examine how the
decision unfolds over time. In the case of PRP, because both
T1 and T2 here are completed using one response medium
(the arm through the Wii remote), there may be influences
on the arm’s dynamics as stimuli “compete.” Specifically,
the analyses of the action dynamics data may reveal a subtle
signature if S2 can draw processing resources away from
S1, or not if the response to the S1 is unaffected by S2 as
the CBT predicts.

Experiment 1
The purpose of the first experiment was to investigate
whether S2 is able pull processing resources away from S1
while using SOAs that are commonly used in PRP
experiments.

Method
Subjects. Participants included 19 (15 females, mean age
20.5) University of Memphis undergraduates from the
psychology subject pool who participated for extra credit in
their introductory psychology course that self-reported
normal or corrected to normal vision and hearing.
Interface display and device. The experiment took place in
an oblong laboratory room (3.8 m x 61.8 m). An Epson
LCD projector and Apple Mac mini were placed on a small
76 cm high table that stood approximately 2.7 m away from
the long wall of the room. The Mac mini’s display was
projected onto the wall at the end of the room creating a
display approximately 1.4 m in width (29.1° visual angle).

Figure 1: Experimental environment and interface.
Participants interacted with the experimental program by
using the Nintendo Wii remote. Standing behind the small

3053

table, participants held the Wii remote in their right hand
that was approximately lined up with the projector’s lens.
The Wii-remote interfaced with the Apple mini computer
via a Blue-tooth transfer protocol called DarwiinRemote
(2006, Hiroaki Kimura). A Nyko infrared emitter at the base
of the projected screen provided the remote with a frame of
reference so that arm movements mapped isomorphically
onto x,y pixel-coordinate movements (see Figure 1).
Procedure. In a basic PRP design, participants performed a
visual discrimination task (T1) and an auditory
discrimination task (T2). Perceptual judgment tasks were
chosen because previous work has suggested that they are
subject to the PRP (Johnston & McCann, 2006). For each
trial, S1 was an image of a bug (2.4° visual angle) that
varied in color from red to blue (i.e., saliently red,
ambiguously red, ambiguously blue, saliently blue). T1 was
to determine whether the presented bug was more red than
blue or vice versa. At varying SOAs (150 ms, 500 ms, 999
ms), a tone (S2) would be played via headphones. There
were four levels of tone pitch that varied between low and
high (300Hz, 500Hz, 700Hz, 900Hz). T2 was to categorize
the pitch of the tone as high or low.
At the beginning of each trial a central fixation point (2.7°
visual angle) and four response boxes (2.8° visual angle)
were displayed on the screen. Above and below the central
fixation point were response boxes labeled “blue” and “red”
respectively. To the left and right of the central fixation
point were response boxes labeled “low” and “high”
respectively (see Figure 2). To begin each trial, participants
clicked the central fixation point. At that time S1 would
replace the fixation point and then be followed by S2.
In previous PRP studies, participants responded to each
stimulus with different hands (Jentzsch, Leuthold, & Ulrich,
2007; Johnston & McCann, 2006; Ruthruff & Pashler,
2001). In the current experiment, responses to both stimuli
were conducted through the participants’ right hand only.
Requiring participants to respond to both stimuli through a
single modality increased competition within the cognitive
system for that modality. Participants were instructed to
respond by moving the Wii remote-controlled mouse cursor
and clicking on the appropriate response boxes that
corresponded to S1 and S2 as quickly and as accurately as
possible. Response order was not fixed. Participants were
told to respond in the order of their perceptual decisions.
Feedback was provided by the presentation of either a green
check mark (to indicate a correct response) or a red “X” (to
indicate a wrong response) in the selected response box. The
trial ended once a correct response to both stimuli was
selected (see Figure 2).
The instructions were explained to each participant prior
to an 8 trial practice stage during which they were allowed
to ask clarification questions about the experimental
procedures. The researcher initiated the experiment and left
the room once the participant verbally acknowledged clear
understanding of the procedures.
During each session, participants went through 5 blocks of

48 trails. In each block every combination of bug color, tone
pitch, and SOA was displayed exactly once in random order.
Participants completed 240 total trials that lasted
approximately 20 minutes. MATLAB was used to develop
the experimental program, produce the tone stimuli, and
sample the Wii-remote-controlled cursor movements as
streaming x-y coordinates.

Measures. The Wii remote is not fixed on a surface (as in
computer-mouse studies, Spivey et al., 2005; Dale et al.,
2007). This causes constant subtle fluctuation in the held out
hand. We therefore use a pixel radius to define an “escape”
region. The amount of time it took for participants to initiate
a movement by moving the cursor out of a 50-pixel escape
region around the central fixation point served as a measure
of latency. Previously, Dale et al. (2008) used a 100-pixel
escape region. However, for the smaller experimental
display presented here it was found that a 100-pixel escape
region was too conservative. We calculated the 50-pixel
latency period for task T1 in milliseconds, producing
latency for T1. How long it took for a response to unfold
over time served as a second measure. Response time for T1
was measured from the onset of S1 until a correct T1
response was selected. This reflects the amount of time the
hand is in motion towards a selection. Response time for T2
was measured from the T1 response selection (or
presentation of S2, whichever came first) to the selection of
a correct T2 response.
Since T1 responses required only vertical movements,
deviations along the x-axis served as a measure of whether
S2 affected T1 responses. For example, if the highest tone
(responded to towards the right response option) is
presented before or during movement, x-axis fluctuation
towards the right may be observed. These x-axis deviations
during T1 responses were analyzed at 50 ms intervals after
the response trajectories exited the escape region. If
response movements capture cognitive competition, then
any x-coordinate deviation present in the evolving
trajectories should reflect the tone response box’s direction.

Results
A 3 (SOA: 150, 500, 999) x 2 (bug: salient vs. ambiguous) x
2 (tone: salient vs. ambiguous) linear mixed effects model
was constructed for each of the measures (using MIXED
procedure in SPSS, with subjects as a random factor). All
trials involving any incorrect response were removed prior
to analysis. Unless otherwise noted, only effects significant
at the .05-level are reported. All other main effects and
interactions not mentioned were not significant.
T1 latency was significantly reduced for saliently colored
bugs by approximately 37 ms. Similarly, RT1 and RT2 were
significantly lowered by ambiguous stimuli by
approximately 122 ms and 72 ms respectively. Also, lower
SOAs induced faster reaction times for both tasks by
approximately 80 ms for T1 and 160 ms for T2. These
findings are displayed in table 1.

Deviations along x-axis. We added an additional predictor
to the mixed models in this analysis. We factored in a
variable reflecting how long the subjects had to process the
T2 stimulus prior to latency movement (which we termed
competition latency). There was a significant main effect of
this competition latency on the x-axis deviations at 50 ms
into the T1 response F(1, 3,428.8)= 7.525, p < .01. It
continued to be significant every 50 ms until 200 ms into
the T1 response and again at 300 ms. There were also
significant interactions between competition latency and
SOA as well as significant three-way interactions among
competition latency, SOA, and sound type (i.e. whether S2
was a high or low pitch tone). The significant findings are
listed in table 2. The three-way interactions are graphed at
50 ms and 250 ms into the T1 response trajectory in Figure
3.

Discussion
The data from the current study are in line with previous
studies that show that task difficulty is manifested in
response trajectories (Dale et al., 2008). Contrary to most
PRP results, we found that as SOA decreased, RT1 and RT2
also decreased. One explanation for this finding could be
that participants took as much time as they were allotted to
process S1 and that the presentation of S2 cued them to
initiate a S1 response. This is likely unique to our study due
to our collapsing of T1 and T2 into one response mode.
The findings of the x-axis deviation analysis show
(relative) movement in the direction of the correct response
to S2 at the shortest SOA, but away from the correct
response at the longer SOAs. This occurs as soon as 50 ms
into the T1 response movement. This finding suggests that
S2 is being processed very early into the T1 response, and
competing with it, resulting in a pull toward the correct T2
response at the shortest SOA. The pull away from the
correct T2 response at longer SOAs may be indicative of
active inhibition. Previous work by McSorley, Haggard and
Walker (2006) has shown that saccade trajectories also
show a similar pattern of deviation toward a distractor when
the saccade latency is less than 200 ms and away from the
distractor when the latency is more than 200 ms, indicating
active inhibition. In an effort to evaluate whether these
effects would be evident using shorter SOAs, a second
experiment was conducted.

Experiment 2
The second experiment used SOAs that more closely
resembled those used by Potter et al. (2002). We predicted
that this adjustment would enhance competition and
therefore participants’ response trajectories would exhibit

3055

more x-axis deviation, reflecting potentially concurrent S2
processing.

Method
Subjects. Participants included 19 (11 females, mean age
19.3) University of Memphis undergraduates from the
psychology subject pool who participated for extra credit in
their introductory psychology course that self-reported
normal or corrected to normal vision and hearing.
Procedure. Procedures for experiment 2 were identical to
experiment 1 except that the SOAs used were 30 ms, 100
ms, 200 ms.

Results
As in the previous experiment, a 3 (SOA: 30, 100, 200) x 2
(bug: salient vs. ambiguous) x 2 (tone: salient vs.
ambiguous) linear mixed effects model was constructed for
each of the measures (using MIXED procedure in SPSS,
with subjects as a random factor). Unless otherwise noted,
only effects significant at the .05-level are reported. All
other main effects and interactions not mentioned were not
significant.
T1 latency was significantly reduced for saliently colored
bugs by approximately 16 ms. Similarly, RT1 and RT2 were
significantly lowered by ambiguous stimuli by
approximately 176 ms and 46 ms respectively. The previous
effect of SOA from Experiment 1 was not retained. These
findings are displayed in table 3.

experiments the shortest SOA yielded a pull toward the
distracting S2 while the longer SOAs seemed to indicate
active inhibition.

Deviations along x-coordinate. There was a significant
main effect of competition latency on the x-axis deviations
at 50 ms into the T1 response F(1, 3,428.8)= 6.06, p < .05. It
continued to be significant every 50 ms until 300 ms into
the T1 response. There were also significant interactions
between competition latency and SOA as well as significant
three-way interactions among competition latency, SOA,
and sound type. The significant findings are listed in Table
4. The three-way interactions are graphed at 50 ms and 550
ms into the T1 response trajectory in Figure 4.

Discussion
The effects of SOA in the reaction time findings of
Experiment 1 were not replicated in Experiment 2. This is
presumably due to that fact that the shortened SOAs of
Experiment 2 didn’t allow participants the luxury of extra
processing time.
In the Experiment 1 inhibition was not evident at the 150
ms SOA. Interestingly, in Experiment 2 inhibition of the T2
response was observed with the 100 ms SOA. Although the
time course of inhibition is not consistent, in both

General Discussion
The investigations discussed in this paper explored how two
stimuli presented within a dual-task paradigm compete with
each other and how the unfolding of the responses to the
presented stimuli reflect not only task difficulty but may
also be indicating an interesting pattern of active inhibition.
The results are preliminary but promising insights toward
developing more fine-grained access to the time course of
decision competition. They do, however, have a number of
limitations. Most notably, the extent to which the stimuli
competed with each other could have been hampered
because in both experiments S1 was a constant stimulus but
S2 was only presented briefly. While this is characteristic of
most PRP experimental designs adjusting the presentation
duration of S1 to equal that of S2 may enhance competition

3056

among the stimuli. Also, reducing the size of the response
boxes is another factor that could be adjusted in order to
provide more fine-grained action dynamics data.
Participants were able to make ballistic-like responses in our
task because target regions were large enough to
accommodate speed over placement accuracy.
Admittedly, these simple aspects of our task may have
sharply influenced the competition observed. In general, the
findings were robust in the x-axis deviations in the T1
response trajectories, suggesting competition and possibly
active inhibition. As shown in the past (Shin, Cho, Lien, &
Proctor, 2007) the cognitive bottleneck is a not “finicky.” It
works to robustly predict responding even in more natural
decision competition situations (Levy, Pashler, & Boer,
2006).
Our position is that to the extent that the cognitive
bottleneck exists, it is less a structural limitation and more
an emergent quality of the cognitive system because it
breaks down under certain circumstances (Brisson &
Jolicoeur, 2007). Importantly, our talk of supporting one
theory over another is an oversimplification, when another
conceptual strategy is quite possible: CBT and competitive
theories may be integrated by identifying the contexts in
which one or the other holds (cf. Dale, 2008; Navon &
Miller, 2002). The data we present here are another step
towards identifying its boundaries.
