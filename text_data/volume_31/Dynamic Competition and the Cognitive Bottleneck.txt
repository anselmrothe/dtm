                       Current Study
The purpose of the experiments presented in this paper is to
explore the implicit predictions of the CBT and the
competition-based approaches within PRP by tracking the
continuous flow of cognition into action. The CBT implies
that while the cognitive system is processing a stimulus it
cannot process anything else until that stimulus has been
completely processed. According to the alternative
approaches, there should be a level of competition even
during the post-perceptual processing that is typically
associated with the CBT approach. In this way, entrance
into a limited capacity stage of processing is an active and
dynamic process that, we propose, should be manifested as
the response unfolds over time.
  These assumptions were investigated by way of the basic
PRP paradigm. However, instead of arbitrary key presses to
indicate responses, participants responded to stimuli using a              Figure 1: Experimental environment and interface.

Procedure. In a basic PRP design, participants performed a
visual discrimination task (T1) and an auditory
discrimination task (T2). Perceptual judgment tasks were
chosen because previous work has suggested that they are
subject to the PRP (Johnston & McCann, 2006). For each
trial, S1 was an image of a bug (2.4° visual angle) that
varied in color from red to blue (i.e., saliently red,
ambiguously red, ambiguously blue, saliently blue). T1 was
to determine whether the presented bug was more red than
blue or vice versa. At varying SOAs (150 ms, 500 ms, 999
ms), a tone (S2) would be played via headphones. There
were four levels of tone pitch that varied between low and
high (300Hz, 500Hz, 700Hz, 900Hz). T2 was to categorize
the pitch of the tone as high or low.

Results
A 3 (SOA: 150, 500, 999) x 2 (bug: salient vs. ambiguous) x
2 (tone: salient vs. ambiguous) linear mixed effects model
was constructed for each of the measures (using MIXED
procedure in SPSS, with subjects as a random factor). All
trials involving any incorrect response were removed prior
to analysis. Unless otherwise noted, only effects significant
at the .05-level are reported. All other main effects and
interactions not mentioned were not significant.
   T1 latency was significantly reduced for saliently colored
bugs by approximately 37 ms. Similarly, RT1 and RT2 were
significantly lowered by ambiguous stimuli by
approximately 122 ms and 72 ms respectively. Also, lower
SOAs induced faster reaction times for both tasks by
approximately 80 ms for T1 and 160 ms for T2. These
findings are displayed in table 1.
