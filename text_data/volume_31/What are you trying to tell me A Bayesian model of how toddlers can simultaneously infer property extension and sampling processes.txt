                       Experiment 1
In this behavioral experiment we asked whether toddlers
could solve this joint inference problem. Children saw an
experimenter draw blue balls from a box and were then
given the yellow ball to play with. We varied the parameters
n and Œ≤ to provide: 1) evidence that could have been
generated in either sampling processes (Blue_3balls
condition: n = 3, Œ≤ = 0.75), or 2) evidence for a very
suspicious coincidence that might suggest a non-random
sampling process (Yellow_3balls condition: n = 3, Œ≤ = 0.25).
As we show in the results section, our Bayesian analysis
predicts very different strengths of evidence in these two
cases.
