Chinese characters involve different lateralization? This is a
fundamental question that goes to the heart of how and why
brain areas are recruited for different tasks. Hence it is of
great interest to examine how these stimuli, and the
computational processes that must be carried out upon them,
are similar and different. Because of the partial decussation
of the optic nerves, our visual system is initially vertically
split, and the two visual hemifields project contralaterally to
different hemispheres. To examine at which processing                     Figure 1: Hemispheric models with different timing of

stimuli were word images instead of faces or objects (Figure
2). In the model, the input image (135 x 100 pixels) was
first filtered with a grid (16 x 12) of overlapping 2D Gabor
filters (Daugman, 1985) in quadrature pairs at six scales and
eight orientations; the six scales corresponded to 2 to 64
cycles per word. Given the image width of 100 pixels, this
frequency range can be considered as the task-relevant
frequency range (the seventh scale would have 128 cycles,
which exceeded the width of the image). The first stage of

implement the second stage of the DFF, a sigmoid-shaped
weighting function was used to bias the Gabor responses on
the left half word (RH) to LSFs and those on the right half
word (LH) to HSFs (Figure 2). Since the early convergence
model failed in accounting for the left side bias in face
perception (Hsiao et al., 2008), and the late convergence
model performed worse than the intermediate convergence
model in the face tasks (when the DFF was applied), here
we used the intermediate convergence model. Thus, in the

how this manipulation changed lateralization of the model.
