Scoring
We analyzed accuracy (proportion of items answered
correctly) and reaction time. For ecological judgments,
correct responses were YES for related items and NO for
unrelated items. For taxonomic judgments, correct
responses were YES for close items and NO for far items.
Reaction time was computed for correct responses only. For
