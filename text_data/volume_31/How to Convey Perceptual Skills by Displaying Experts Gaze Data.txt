using visuospatial information to cognitively structure the
information in the same way as the speaker. Accordingly, if
displaying expert’s gazes could make a novice follow
experts’ eye movements, the novice should can be expected
to have a better understanding of the experts‘ verbalizations.
Hypotheses
Differences are hypothesized concerning the perceptual
aspects of task performance in that the gaze display group
will outperform the control group. Moreover, both groups              Figure 1: Screen shot of an instructional video with GD.
