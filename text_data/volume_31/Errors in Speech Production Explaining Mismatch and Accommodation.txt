Model Construction
   To construct our model, we used the two basic
components from ACT-R: the memory module for storing
symbolic information and the production system for
defining the sequence of events that should occur within the
model. In contrast with standard ACT-R, four separate
special-purpose memories were defined, each of which can
act in parallel. The feature store is a long-term static
memory holding the particular features of each phoneme.
The first and second speech planning module are short-term
memories holding the phonemes currently being processed.
Finally, the rule memory stores the rules to be applied.
   It should be noted that we are not assuming these
components are identical to the standard ACT-R production
system and declarative memory system. In particular, they
must be much faster in order to produce speech effectively.          Figure 3: Proportion of responses for the first model that

methods for configuring the recall error from such a
memory. First, there is random fluctuation of the activity
levels of a chunk (s in Equation 1). Second, a similarity
score can be set between values to indicate that, for
example, a retrieval attempt for red would only receive a
small activation penalty for retrieving pink instead. We use
this method here to indicate the level of similarity between
phoneme pairs such as z and s.
   This results in a complex model, but with only two free
parameters. All other parameters are fixed due to the choice
of using the ACT-R components as a general-purpose
cognitive architecture. Importantly, the accommodation and
mismatch error rates are not independently adjustable in our
model. Instead, they arise from an interplay between these
parameters and the overall system.
Modelling Results
To determine the accuracy of our model, we compared it to             Figure 4: The proportion of mismatch errors minus the

this type look like? The answer is that an error of
phonological rule processing, that is the failure of a
phonological rule to apply, would look like a mismatch
error. The second model presented here represents this
option.
   This model introduces error into the application of rules
itself. It is identical to the first model, except that random
noise has been added when retrieving the rule to be applied.
If this retrieval fails, the phonological rule will fail to apply,
leading to a mismatch error.
   Rather than introducing a new parameter to adjust the
probability of a rule failing, we used the same value as the
random noise in the rest of the model. This keeps our
model as simple as possible, rather than adding new
independently adjustable parameters.

                          Conclusion
The tongue twister study presented here shows that the
surface phonology does not always conform to its erroneous
environment. This result can be interpreted in two ways.
First, this could show that phonological rules can, contrary
to previous assumptions, be processed before speech errors
