hypothesized to be more accurate at perceiving basketball-
relevant affordances (the maximum height another can reach
overhand and the maximum height another can reach
overhand by jumping) than non-basketball players both for
self and for another. Basketball players were hypothesized
to be no more accurate than non-basketball players at
perceiving a non-basketball-related affordance (the
maximum height at which one can sit upon a surface) both
for self and other.
                          Method
Twenty-two undergraduate students at the University of
Cincinnati participated in this study. Eleven participants had
never played on a basketball team (non-basketball players;
mean height = 174.70 cm) and 11 had played on a
basketball team within two years prior to participating in
this study (basketball players; mean height = 179.05 cm).
Non-basketball players spent an average of 1.05 hours/week
playing and practicing basketball, while basketball players
spent an average of 8.64 hours/week playing and practicing
