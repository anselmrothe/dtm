consider how opinions are changed.
   Thus, the present work is a psychological extension of the
previous work. We predict that information about how many
supporters a story already has will not only influence
people’s decisions to vote for a story but also change their
actual preferences and opinions about the interestingness of
the story. This will produce a robust positive feedback loop.
   In contrast to the past studies analyzing people’s natural
behavior in online environments, we conduct controlled
experiments using materials from real environments. In
Experiment 1, we examine a possible role of interestingness
of Digg news stories in people’s decisions. In Experiment 2,
we investigate the extent to which the previous ratings of
others influence people’s ratings on the interestingness of
news stories. In Experiment 3, we examine the role that the

                        Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we test the possibility that some news
stories become widely popular in Digg because they are
inherently interesting and everyone votes for these
interesting stories. If this is the case, stories with more past
diggs or supporters should be rated more interesting by new
raters than stories that fewer people supported. We selected
some news articles in Digg with varying number of
supporters. We asked participants to rate how interesting
they thought the articles were, withholding the information
about the number of diggs associated with the stories.

   The stories used in Experiment 1 were all popular stories
that were promoted to the front page in Digg. The
participants might have been familiar with some of the
stories, which influenced their decisions. We deal with this
issue in Experiment 2.
                       Experiment 2
The negative correlation between the story's interestingness
and its popularity in Experiment 1 suggests that the inherent
interestingness of stories is not the reason people vote for
the stories. One possibility is that people are supporting
stories that many others support (Sakamoto et al., 2008). In
particular, it may be that people’s perceptions of stories
change according to the opinions of others. When people
have no strong feeling about a story, they may rely on how
others feel about the story to make their own judgment.
   In Experiment 2, we examine how one’s decisions are                Figure 3: Two of the six news stories from Digg used in
