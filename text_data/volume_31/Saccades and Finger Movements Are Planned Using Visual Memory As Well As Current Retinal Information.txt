Abstract: It has been shown that in planning hand movements, memory is integrated with current visual input,
based on their relative reliabilities. We present a similar result for planning eye movements in a natural task with no
explicit memory requirement. Our virtual task involved moving a ”weapon” to a ”reload station” 15 or 30 degrees
of visual angle to the left, then back to a circular target on the right. In 33
