computer-based pre and posttest that consisted of article-

items, students chose an article from a dropdown menu to
complete the sentence. In the article with explanation items,
students chose an article to complete the sentence and then
chose the feature or rule that explained their answer. No

explaining or the free response self-explanation group since
they did not receive feedback on their explanations, it is
surprising that even students in the menu tutoring condition,
who had practice selecting explanations and immediate
feedback on their choices, did not improve in their ability to
select the correct rule that explained their answer.
 How much time did students spend using the tutors?
   When evaluating classroom interventions, another
important factor is the amount of time it takes students to
complete the instruction. While the instruction was designed
to keep time-on-task close, there was a marginal difference
between the conditions in the amount of time it took
students to complete the tutors (F(2, 58) = 2.90, p = 0.063).
Post-hoc Tukey HSD tests revealed that students using the
menu tutor completed the instruction the fastest (M = 13.3
minutes, SD = 6.0) but not significantly faster than those
who used the no self-explanation tutor (p = 0.682, M = 15.2
minutes, SD = 6.8), and the no self-explanation tutor was
not significantly faster than the free-response tutor (p =
0.270, M = 18.5, SD = 7.8) However, the menu self-                                           Figure 5: Linear regression shows a
