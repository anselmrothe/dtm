Abstract: This work contrasts several modeling strategies and proposes a new modeling approach. It demonstrates
the existence of a new account to explain the first episode of skilled problem solving observed in Anzai & Simon
(1979). The resulting characterization of the learners strategies is stronger than the classical Selective Search account
based on heuristics that avoid move repetitions (Anzai & Simon, 1979
