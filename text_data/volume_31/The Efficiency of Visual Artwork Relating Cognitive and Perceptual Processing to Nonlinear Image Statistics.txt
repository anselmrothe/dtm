Abstract: It has been suggested that artwork is efficiently matched to human visual processing. If artists consistently
seek modes of representation that are efficiently processed by the human visual system, these shared techniques
should leave statistical signatures. Mounting evidence suggests that regular luminance and spatial statistics in art
may influence perceptual and cognitive responses. We have demonstrated that image statisticsespecially nonlinear
statisticsare good predictors of human judgments of similarity for pairs of artworks, and other groups have found
statistics that appear relevant to higher-level cognitive properties including aesthetic and affective responses. In this
poster, we will synthesize results of a suite of our recent behavioral tests of the role of regular statistics in art, which
together suggest art is indeed efficient and that artwork contains clues about the nature of human visual processing.
