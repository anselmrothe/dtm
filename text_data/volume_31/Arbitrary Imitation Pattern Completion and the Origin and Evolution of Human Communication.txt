                       Hypothesis
This paper is concerned with the idea that arbitrary
imitation for PC evolved in hominins prior to the
appearance of communication. Specifically, I test the
hypothesis that arbitrary imitation for PC in a
population can result in a behavioral system that both
(a) reflects the structure of the population’s
environment, and (b) is shared by all members of the
population, in the absence of any intention or
expectation of communication.
