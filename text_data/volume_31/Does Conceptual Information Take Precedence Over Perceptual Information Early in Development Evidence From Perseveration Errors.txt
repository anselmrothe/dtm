experimental conditions. Overall, 15 out of 23 participants
in the Conceptual-to-Perceptual Switch condition, and 17
out of 26 participants in the Perceptual-to-Conceptual
Switch condition failed to provide at least 6 out of 8 (or
75%) correct responses during the pre-switch phase.
  As shown in Figure 2, three-year-old children who passed
the pre-switch phase (providing at least 75% of correct
responses) exhibited a somewhat larger decrease in accuracy
in the Perceptual-to-Conceptual condition than in the
Conceptual-to-Perceptual condition (averaging a 42% and a
23% decrease in accuracy respectively, independent-
samples t (15) = 1.5, one-tailed p = .08; this difference
reached only marginal significance likely due to very small
number of children who passed the pre-switch phase).
