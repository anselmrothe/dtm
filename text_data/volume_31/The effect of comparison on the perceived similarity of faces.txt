that focus on differences highlight the distinctive features of
the compared faces, and are therefore expected to result in
increased memory performance (Brown & Lloyd-Jones,
2005).
   One possible explanation for the absence of a memory
advantage for difference focussed comparisons is that the

difference comparisons. A recent study, which investigated
the effects of comparison on perceived similarity, found that

process of structural alignment underlies both similarity and
difference comparisons. According to the structural
alignment view, the discovery of meaningful differences
involves first discovering similarities.

The present experiment investigates the effect of
comparison processes on the perceived similarity of faces.
According to the distinctiveness hypothesis, perceived

According to structural alignment theory both similarity and
dissimilarity comparisons should result in an increase in
perceived similarity.                                                     Figure 1: An example of the dissimilar (top row) and
