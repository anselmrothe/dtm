questions were held constant between the conditions.
Finally, when the students finished all of the ASSISTments
in the experiment section, they were given the post-test
which is the pre-test question repeated. Also similar to the
pre-test, the first response of the student is recorded and
used for analysis. However, unlike the pre-test, we do
inform the students regarding the correctness of their
answer. Learning can be assessed by comparing the results
of the pre-test and the post-test.
   In the worked example condition, when a student gives an
incorrect answer or presses on the “Break this problem into
steps” button, a problem that is similar to the main question
is shown solved step by step. As such, the students will have
a pattern to follow in order to solve the problem. The
worked example condition is shown in Figure 1. The student
is asked to read through the worked example and choose “I
have read the example and now I am ready to try again”
when he/she is done. The student is then asked to do the
original problem again.
   In the tutored problem solving condition, students who
get a problem wrong are asked to answer a set of questions
that break down the main problem into steps, shown in
Figure 2. If the student provides a wrong answer or presses
on the “Break this problem into steps” button, he/she will be
directed to the first scaffolding question, which helps the
student to understand the first step to solve the original
problem. Students can ask for hints on each step if they need
more help. If the student presses on the “Show me a hint”
button, hints will be shown one by one until the student
reaches a “bottom-out hint” which is typically the answer to
this scaffolding question. After this, the student is directed
to the next scaffolding question. The number of scaffolding
questions depends on the complexity of the original
question. At the end, the student is expected to understand
how to do the original problem step by step.
   During the experiment, teachers introduced the problem
sets as a regular assignment. As such, students were not
aware of the randomized controlled experiment. They were
neither briefed about the problem set structure nor the
number of ASSISTments in a problem set. Thus, students
might not have been aware that they were taking a pre-test
until they submitted an answer, as we tell them that the
question they answered was a pre-test only after answer
submission.                                                         Figure 1: The worked example condition requires students
