     Experiment 1: Subtraction & Text Entry
Experiment 1 consists of a complex dual-task, to show how
threaded cognition can account for such a task without using
customized cognitive control. Participants had to perform
two tasks concurrently: a subtraction task and a text entry
task. Both tasks were presented in two versions: an easy
version in which there was no need to maintain a problem
state, and a hard version where participants had to maintain
a problem state from one response to the next. As threaded
cognition claims that the problem state module can only be
used by one task concurrently, we hypothesized that when a            Figure 1. Module processing in threaded cognition in a
