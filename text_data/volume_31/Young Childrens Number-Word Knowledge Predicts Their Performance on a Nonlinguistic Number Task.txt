                            Results
Each child was assigned a knower-level, based on
performance in the Give-N task. Of the 71 children who
participated, there were 7 pre-number-knowers, 8 “one”-
knowers, 15 “two”-knowers, 9 “three”-knowers, 7 “four”-
knowers, and 25 cardinal-principle-knowers.
   A ‘number replication’ score was calculated from the Set-
Replication Task. For this score, the child’s response was
marked correct if she correctly replicated the number of
items in the target set. A separate ‘type/color replication’
score was also calculated, which reflected the child’s choice
of the correct type and/or color of items, on trials where
