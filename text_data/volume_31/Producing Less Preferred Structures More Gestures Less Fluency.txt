   Disfluencies can be seen as overt signs of production
difficulty. Speakers are more disfluent before words that are
unlikely (Beattie & Butterworth, 1979; Shriberg & Stolcke,
1996), and when they are planning longer and more
complex utterances (Clark & Wasow, 1998).
Gesture and Speech Production
   In addition to disfluencies, hand gestures may offer a
privileged window onto speech planning because they can
occur simultaneously with speech. Indeed, gestures are
precisely timed with respect to the accompanying speech
