Abstract: A left hemisphere (LH) bias has been found for various types of categorical processing: for adult categor-
ical spatial judgements; category prototype effects; category learning and categorical perception of colour. Here we
investigate whether there is a LH bias in categorical perception of orientation. Various studies have established that
orientation categories such as horizontal, oblique, vertical, steep and shallow affect accuracy and speed of orientation
discrimination on memory and search tasks. The current study, using lateralised stimulus presentations of 200ms,
found faster and more accurate discrimination of oriented lines from different categories than oriented lines from
the same category, even when the degree of difference was equated across conditions. This effect was stronger for
right-visual field than left-visual field discriminations, suggesting a LH bias in categorical processing of orientation
in adults. Findings are related to theories on the role of the LH in visual categorisation.
