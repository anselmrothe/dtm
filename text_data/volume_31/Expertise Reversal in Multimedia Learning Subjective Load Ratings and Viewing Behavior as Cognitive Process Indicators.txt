The aforementioned assumptions were tested by using two
types of variables indicating different learning processes.
First, learners’ subjective ratings of load type scales were
used as subjective post measures of different cognitive
processes (Cierniak, Scheiter & Gerjets, 2009). Second,
learners’ viewing behavior during studying was recorded                         Figure 1: Illustrations of the learning material about the
