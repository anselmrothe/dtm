the fundamental trade-off between grooming and gossip
from the perspective of an individual agent. Grooming
strongly reinforces its social bonds, while gossip is slightly
less intimate, but provides social information. If the agents
were real primates competing for dominance, strong bonds
would help them form effective alliances, while social
information would allow them to predict the likelihood of
other alliances forming. Thus, both grooming and gossip
contribute to reproductive success, if in slightly different
ways. This is reflected in our model’s fitness function,
which rewards agents both for the strength of their social
bonds and for the amount of social information that they
have. Whether agents prefer to groom or gossip depends on          Figure 1: Gossip probability of the last generations of agents

basic assumptions clearly predict that individuals in larger       evolving gossip as a primary means of maintaining social
groups are more likely to benefit from the ability to gossip.      cohesion is rather difficult, and may take many generations.
Discussion In our model, the fact that larger group sizes
cause agents to evolve higher gossip probabilities can be
accounted for as follows: For gossip probability to increase,
it needs to provide agents with higher fitness. Because the
social payoff of gossip is structurally lower than the social
payoff of grooming, the information payoff of gossip needs
to be high enough to outweigh its social costs. For this to
occur, agents need to acquire enough new information while
gossiping. In smaller group sizes, this will be difficult, as
the number of potential gossiping partners and topics is
limited. Because of this, agents will tend to discuss the same
topics repeatedly, and gain no fitness increases by
participating in conversation. To illustrate this with an
example: Any given social event is always experienced by
at least six agents, directly or indirectly: Two participants,
and four observers. In a group of ten agents, this means at        Figure 2: Evolution of gossip probability across generations,
least 60% of agents is aware of it; in a group of 160 agents,                       for five different group sizes.
this drops to 3.75%. This means that gossip is virtually
useless to agents in small group sizes, while it can bring
considerable benefits to agents in large group sizes.
