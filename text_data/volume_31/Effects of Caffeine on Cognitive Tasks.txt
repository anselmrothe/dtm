Twenty four healthy (non smoking) volunteers aged
between (19-38 years) participated in this experiment with a
mean age of (26.5), with no history of psychiatric disease.
All subjects gave written informed consent to take part in
the study, which was approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committee, Swinburne University of Technology.
Study Design
A double blind, counter-balanced, placebo controlled, cross-

different drug conditions [placebo and caffeine (250mg)]
separated by a seven-day ‘wash-out’ period. The doses
selected were based on previous research that found
