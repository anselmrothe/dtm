schemes of straight paths and paths with turns (99
instances). An example of this category is a path that enters
the site directly, makes half a circle around the sculpture
courtyard, and then proceeds directly to the outside of the
site. Generally, the team tried to achieve a scheme where the
public would use the path as a shortcut and still enjoy the
building as much as possible. In the hybrid schemes, the
time spent is elongated and the general public is given a
chance of a momentary pause to experience the sculpture              Figure 1: A variation where path circles around the court. 3

   The second important theme in the design was the idea of
a centrally located sculpture court that would unify the
fragmented components. The court emerged early in the
design process, most likely in reference to the Düsseldorf
competition entry. There were only 13 schemes without a
court as opposed to 228 schemes with a court among all the
sketches investigated in detail. Once it emerged, the idea
was studied in several variations, which can be grouped in
six headings according to shape: triangle (2), rectangle (11),
square (13), ellipse (6), circle (195), and semi-circle (1).
