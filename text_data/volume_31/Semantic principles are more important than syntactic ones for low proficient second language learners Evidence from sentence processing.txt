Semantic principles are more important than syntactic ones for low
proficient second language learners: Evidence from sentence processing
Josje Verhagen
Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics & Free University Amsterdam
Abstract: Beginning second language (L2) learners of Germanic languages often place verbs behind negation and
certain adverbs, thereby violating the target-like word order (Vainikka & Young-Scholten, 1996). Syntactic accounts
of L2 acquisition explain this by assuming that full syntactic structures cannot be projected in early L2 grammars.
Semantic accounts explain the pattern by a principle of scope marking: verbs follow scope-bearing elements, such as
negation and adverbs, since they fall in their semantic scope domain. Two auditory sentence processing experiments
are presented to distinguish between these accounts. Subjects are beginning Moroccan and Turkish learners of Dutch.
In experiment 1, items contain lexical verbs or auxiliary verbs that precede or follow negation. In experiment 2,
negation is replaced by temporal adverbs. The results show that processing preferences are dependent on differences
in scope properties between negation and (different types of) adverbs, suggesting that semantic rather than syntactic
principles guide early L2 processing.
