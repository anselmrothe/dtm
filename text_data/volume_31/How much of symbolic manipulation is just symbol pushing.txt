Discussion
Solutions to single operation arithmetic equations contained
fewer errors when the perceived movement of the grating
was congruent with the imagined motion specified by the
motion strategy, particularly on problems requiring the
participant to make non-commutative computations,
suggesting that participants use the motion strategy
particularly when the order of items matters.
   Experiment 1 suggests that reasoners typically use
imagery of or knowledge about dynamic, continuous motion
to guide sequential computation; however, participants were
tested only on very simple equations of only four types.
Furthermore, participants’ mathematical expertise was not
investigated, and so it is not clear whether motion strategies
dominate among novices, mathematical experts, or both.
Experiment 2 addresses both of these issues.

Method
Participants Fifty-eight undergraduates attending either the
University of Illinois, or Indiana University received partial
course credit in exchange for participation.
Materials and Procedure Participants sat at a comfortable
distance from a computer monitor (roughly 50cm). Stimuli
consisted of 80 two-step algebra problems, expressed in
standard mathematical notation. In each problem, one side
consisted of a single number, between 1 and 63. The other
side was an expression with the pattern y  M  N , where 
was either multiplication (“*”) or division (“/”),  was
either addition or subtraction, and M and N were integers.
M and N had values between 1 and 18, and were selected so
that each step of the typical solution path of a problem
involved only positive integers. The symbols were were
displayed with a medium gray color. Participants solved
each of the 80 equation three times: once with each
background state. Thus, participants solved a total of 240
equations.
   Each problem had two versions. In one, the variable
appeared on the left; in the other, it appeared on the right;
thus, there were 40 formally distinct problems. Problems
were coded by whether they contained zero, one, or two
commutative operations in their representation (remember
that problems containing more commutative operations in
their representation contain fewer commutative calculations
in their solution). 10 problems contained no commutative
operations, 20 contained one, and 10 contained two
commutative operations.

moving sinusoidal grating. The grating occupied the entire
