Abstract: How do young children figure out that markings can be used as symbols for things in the world? Three
studies used a map-reading task to examine the role that labeling plays in cueing children into the referential use
of markings. Study 1 reports a striking failure among toddlers to use abstract maps as representations for a set
of familiar objects when object labels were not given for the markings. Children succeeded, however, when labels
were provided, and when the images in the maps were realistic-looking (Study 2), children succeeded whether or
not object labels were given. As this could owe to covertly labeling the familiar images rather than the perceptual
similarity between the images and objects, a third study used realistic images of novel objects, and found that
children succeeded only when labels were provided. Labeling appears to be an important source of evidence to the
referential function of markings.
