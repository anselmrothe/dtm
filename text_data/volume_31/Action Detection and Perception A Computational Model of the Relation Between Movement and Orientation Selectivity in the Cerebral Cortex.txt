Following such limited exposure to light (and removed from
the apparatus) kittens that were able to control their
movements (group B) were able to make visually guided
paw placements and could also avoid a visual cliff. The
kittens from the gondola (group A) however were unable to
perform either task and behaved as if blind. In subsequent
unrestrained exposure to light, all the kittens developed
normally. For Held and Hein this confirmed their thesis that
“self-produced movement with its concurrent visual
feedback is necessary for the development of visually-
guided behavior.” (1967, p. 875). They further consider and
dismiss the possibility that these results were due to either         Figure 2: Screenshot of the ICEAsim rat in a simulated

As the computational model of the cortex underlying these
experiments and its neurophysiological basis is non-trivial
we delay their discussion to a later section of this paper. Of
relevance to this section however is that, deflection
information from the robots whiskers provided input to a
somatosensory / barrel cortex analogue, and pixel
information from the cameras provided input to a visual
cortex analogue. Furthermore motor signals controlling the
robot’s movements could optionally provide input to a
motor cortex analogue (see Figure 3 for a connection
diagram of the model).
A Computational Model of the Cortex
For many neuroscientists the basic unit of the cortex is the
cortical micro-column, a structure of between 10 and
100,000 cells with inhibitory lateral connectivity between
local micro-columns, and excitatory connections between              Figure 3: Connection diagram showing the major pathways
