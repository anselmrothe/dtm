Over, 1995). Is this important inference an automatic
information processing step, or does it involve willingness
and attention? Some scholars hold the former view,
claiming that MP inferences are triggered whenever the
premises match the corresponding logical schema, even
without willingness to do so (e.g., Braine & O’Brien, 1998).
So far, this issue has not been definitively settled by
empirical studies. Nevertheless, some methodologically
interesting strategies have been proposed, which capitalize
on “priming effects”. These are the effects of pre-activated
information on the processing of target stimuli (Meyer &
Schvaneveldt, 1971; Milliken, Joordens, Merikle, &
Seiffert, 1998; Neely, 1977; Tipper, 1985). Thus in the
present case, if MP were fully automatic, given the premise
pair: (P1) “If there is a 3 then there is an 8” and (P2) “there
is a 3”, individuals should activate the conclusion “there is
an 8”, even if they are not willing or interested to do so.
Accordingly, if those individuals were later required to
perform a simple non-deductive task, e.g. establishing
whether a target number is odd or even, their responses
should be primed if the target numbers are preceded by
premise pairs such as P1 and P2 and the target number
coincides with the MP conclusion (e.g., “8”). All previous
studies that checked for priming effects driven by MP
conclusions used text comprehension tasks, where all the
premises of the MP inference were explicitly attended to by
participants, who had the goal of understanding a given text
passage (Lea, 1995; Rader & Sloutsky, 2002). Under those
circumstances it is difficult to demonstrate that participants
were not voluntarily reasoning, even though they were not
told to do so. In the present study we eliminated that
confound by investigating whether MP inferences are
activated when participants are not aware of one of the
triggering premises, which is presented subliminally
(Naccache & Dehaene, 2001b). The finding that valid
conclusions of MP problems prime subsequent targets when
one of the problem premises is not consciously available to
the participant would indicate both that the MP inference
could be triggered by subliminal stimuli and that it could be
carried out without voluntary control.

Abstract
We investigated whether a basic deductive inference, namely
the modus ponens, is an automatic processing step carried out
even in the absence of willingness to reason and awareness of
all the premises. We used an exhaustive set of conditional
problems concerning numbers, with a subliminal second
premise, followed by a target number. Participants evaluated
whether the target number was odd or even. The target
number could match or not match a valid conclusion endorsed
by the premises. We found that evaluations of target numbers
matching the conclusion of a modus ponens were faster than
the evaluations of numbers following all other types of
problems. This finding shows that modus ponens is automatic
and can be triggered by subliminal stimuli.
Keywords: deduction; reasoning; subliminal processing.

Introduction
Deductive reasoning has a special status among cognitive
processes, because the ability to recognize simple deductive
arguments is a core property of rational thought (Rips,
1988). The most intuitively straightforward deductive
inference is the one that logicians call Modus Ponens (MP).
According to this inference, from the statement “IF so-andso is true, THEN such-and-such is true” (first premise, or
major premise, or P1), and the statement “so-and-so is true”
(second premise, or minor premise, or P2), we are entitled to
conclude that “such-and-such is true”. Rips (1988) argued
that Modus Ponens is so central to our notion of intelligence
and rationality, that a contrary inference is out of the
question: we can conceive the existence of creatures with
perceptual systems differing from our own, and even with
inferential systems with some differences from our own, but
we can hardly conceive the existence of a creature that
systematically endorses an inference opposite to MP,
concluding “such-and-such is NOT true” from the premises
P1 and P2 above (Rips, 1988; Quine, 1970, chap. 6). In
reasoning studies, MP inferences are almost error-free, with
correctness scores ranging from 90% to 100% (Evans,
Newstead, & Byrne, 1993; but the inference is less available
if the participants do not trust the premises, see Stevenson &

201

variety of problems allowed for planned comparisons of the
effects of different valid and invalid schemata in the
analyses. It was also possible to control for parasite effects
caused by matches between the target number and the
second premise, independently from the conclusion
endorsed by the premises.

Experiment
Methods
Participants. Fifty-four (44 females, 10 males) graduate
and undergraduate students from the University of MilanoBicocca participated in the experiment in exchange for
course credits.
Stimuli. Overall the experiment involved the presentation of
328 trials. 264 were number evaluation trials and 64 were
sentence recognition trials. Each number evaluation trial
was composed of two premises and a target number. The
first premises (P1) were conditional statements concerning
numbers (e.g., “if there is a 2 then there is a 4”). The second
premises (P2) and the targets (T) were numbers (e.g., “2”).
The structure of the sentence recognition trials was identical
to the number evaluation trials, with the exception of the
targets. In those trials, the targets were composed of two
conditional statements. One of the two statements was
identical to P1.
In the following paragraphs, problems will be indicated by
stating their four arguments (literals and negations). For
instance, “p not q r p” (abbreviated to “p.nq.r.p”) stands for
“if there is a p then there is not a q” (P1), “r” (P2), “p” (T).
Letters stand for Arabic numerals from 1 to 9.
The first premises (P1) used in the experiment were
generated by orthogonally rotating the presence/absence of
negations on the two literals. This provided four different
structures: if p then q, if not p then q, if p then not q, if not p
then not q. The second premises (P2) were either identical
(match trials) or different (mismatch trials) to one of the
numbers (p, q) involved in P1. In particular, in match trials,
each P1 type was followed half of the time by “p” and half
of the time by “q”. Thus P2 matched either the first or
second literal of P1. In the mismatch trials each P1 type was
followed by an “r”, i.e. a number that was not mentioned in
P1. Overall the manipulations on P1 and P2 generated 12
pairs of premises. The target was different depending on
whether the trial consisted in number evaluation or sentence
recognition. In the sentence recognition trials, the target was
composed of two conditional sentences. One of the two
sentences was identical to the P1 used in the same trial. In
the number evaluation trials, each one of the 12 pairs of
premises was coupled half of the time with a “p” target
number, and the other half with a “q” target number,
accounting for 24 types of trials. Furthermore, in the case of
mismatch conditions, the target number could also be an “r”
or an “s”: i.e., a number identical to P2 (“r”) or a number
not presented in the two premises (“s”). Thus overall, 32
different types of number evaluation trials were devised.
The whole array of valid and invalid inferences typically
studied with conditional premises is a subset of our
problems. For example, in our set there were instances of
the valid modus tollens schema (MT: if A then B; not B;
therefore not A, translating into “np.nq.q.p”, or “np.q.r.p”).
Furthermore, there were some classic fallacious inferences
that are often accepted by naïve reasoners (“affirmation of
the consequent” and “denial of the antecedent”). This

Procedure. Participants were presented with the stimuli
described in the preceding section. Each trial started with a
fixation point (1000 ms), followed by P1 for 2500 ms.
Participants were told that they had to read and remember
P1. After P1, P2 was briefly presented (50 ms), masked by
two strings of 10 random characters presented for 83 ms
before and after P2 (Fig. 1; in the figure only 6 characters
are reported). This procedure prevented subjects from being
aware of the presentation of P2. After P2 there was a delay
of 750 ms in the long Inter stimulus Interval (ISI) group,
and no delay for the short ISI group. This manipulation was
introduced in order to sample priming effects in a wider
time window after presentation of P2 (Draine & Greenwald,
1998). Finally, the target was presented. In the case of
sentence recognition trials, a pair of sentences was presented
for max 4000 ms. By contrast, in the number evaluation
trials, a number was presented for max 200 ms. The target
disappeared as soon as the participants pressed the response
button. If no answer was given within the allowed time, the
trial ended and was scored as incorrect. The task
participants had to perform depended on whether a sentence

recognition trial or a number evaluation trial was being
presented. In the sentence recognition trials, participants had
to identify which out of the two sentences was identical to
P1. In number evaluation trials, the participants were
required to judge whether the number was odd or even.
After the experiment the participants were asked to indicate
what they saw after the first sentence. None of them
reported having seen a number (the masked P2), while all of

2005). Each of the further 8 planned comparisons are
reported in Tab. 1. We found that in MP trials the target was
processed faster than in all the other trial types (t(40)=1.89,
p = .033). In particular (Tab. 1), MP trials (p.q.p.q) were
faster than trials with exactly the same P1 and P2 but a
target number that differed from the MP conclusion
(p.q.p.p). Furthermore, the MP trials were also faster than
MT trials endorsing a valid conclusion matching the target
number (p.nq.q.p), and they were faster than fallacies such
as the affirmation of the consequent (p.q.q.p) or the negation
of the antecedent (np.nq.p.q). Overall, this indicates that a
priming effect was selectively present in the trials where the
target was the conclusion of a MP inference.
No priming effects were found when a separate analysis
was carried out of the 13 participants who had been
discarded for low-level performance on the sentence
recognition tasks.

them reported seeing a flickering string of random letters.
Before the experimental session, all participants underwent
a 40-trial training session with correctness feedback.
Response Times (RTs) on the number evaluation tasks were
the main dependent variable for assessing whether
processing of targets was affected by the deductive
conclusions enabled by the two premises. Subjects with an
average score lower than 90% on the sentence recognition
trials were discarded from further analyses. This was
necessary in order to be sure that participant adequately
represented P1 in working memory.
Apparatus. The experiment was programmed and
administered using PresentationTM. The CRT screen was set
at resolution 1024 x 768 pixels and at 60 Hz refreshing rate.
Two buttons of a serial mouse were used as response keys.
Participants responded with the index fingers of both hands.

Results
Discussion

Thirteen participants were discarded from analyses
because they did not reach 90% accuracy levels in the
sentence recognition trials. All remaining 41 participants
had accuracies > 90% in both sentence recognition and
number evaluation trials. In line with preceding studies on
priming (Naccache & Dehaene, 2001a, 2001b), on the
number evaluation trials we considered only responses with
RTs between 250 ms and 1000 ms (92.5% of all responses).
We planned to compare the RTs of the modus ponens (MP)
problems (“p.q.p.q.”) with the RTs of: (i) all other problems
that endorsed a valid or fallacious conclusion identical to
the target number (e.g.: MP vs. modus tollens; MP vs.
affirmation of the consequent; MP vs. denial of the
antecedent), and (ii) all problems that did not support a
conclusion identical to the target number, but differed in one
feature only from the MP problems (e.g.: MP vs. “p.q.r.q”;
MP vs. “p.nq.p.q”, etc.). Overall, 9 problems were involved
in the planned comparisons. First, we assessed the effect of
ISI length on the reaction times of these problems. A 9 x 2
ANOVA factoring the problem type as a within-participant
factor and the ISI as a between-participant factor yielded
reliable main effects of both problem type [F(8,312) = 2.17,
p <.05], and ISI length [short-ISI: mean RTs = 646 ms;
long-ISI: mean RTs = 584 ms; F(1,39) = 4.27, p < .05].
However, given that the interaction was not significant
[F(8,312) = .83], we pooled all participants together in the
subsequent analyses. Second, we compared the RTs of the
Modus Ponens with the RTs of the critical problem p.q.r.q,
i.e. the problem that is identical to MP apart from the
presence of a subliminal non-matching minor premise “r”.
MP was significantly faster (t(40)=2.78, p = .0082, twotailed). Finally, we further checked whether MP was also
faster than the other 8 relevant problems. To that aim, a
conjunction analysis was run. For the conjunction analysis
an α-level of .05 (one-tailed) was used: this corresponds to
requiring a p < .05 for each pair-wise comparison
considered in the conjunctin. This procedure is valid, even
though it has been noticed that it might be even too

In the present study we investigated whether the modus
ponens inference, a basic inference that is at the core of
human rational thought (Rips, 1988, 1994), is an automatic
information processing step that can be carried out even
without the willingness to do so. Furthermore, we
investigated whether MP requires a fully explicit
representation of its premises, or can also be triggered by
stimuli that are not consciously perceived. We devised an
experiment in which the minor premise of a series of
deductive problems was presented subliminally (Dehaene,
Changeux, Naccache, Sackur, & Sergent, 2006; Naccache &
Dehaene, 2001b).

Subjects were required to perform a non-reasoning task
on subsequent conclusions. Strikingly, we found that - given
an explicit premise “if p then q” - a subsequent subliminal
premise “p” produced a positive priming effect on a target
number corresponding to the MP conclusion (“q”),
compared to a problem that was fully identical apart from
the presence of a subliminal non-matching premise “r”,

instead of “p”. Notice that subjects were not even aware of
the presence of a minor premise, let alone of the differences
among different minor premises and their integrability to the
major premise. Moreover, we evaluated whether the priming
effect also occurs when MP is compared with a variety of
different problem types, including the modus tollens and the
fallacies of the affirmation of the consequent and the
negation of the antecedent. The effect was present in all
comparisons: processing targets embedded in modus ponens
problems was systematically faster. Furthermore, the
absence of priming effect with the affirmation of the
consequent fallacy (p.q.q.p) shows that the subliminal
processing of conditional premises is unidirectional. It can
only go from the antecedent to the consequent. This finding
supports the idea that the MP is triggered by a specific
logical circuit, and is not a side effect of a more general, bidirectional (and thus logically invalid) spreading-activation
mechanism between the antecedent and the consequent of a
conditional premise. Finally, we showed that the MP
priming effect was observable only in those participants
who adequately attended and correctly encoded the
conditional major premise in working memory. Thus, the
implicit, subliminal representation of the minor premise can
trigger the modus ponens inference only if the major
premise is explicitly and adequately represented in working
memory.
These findings strongly argue for the automaticity of the
modus ponens, as suggested by the “mental logic” theory of
deductive reasoning (Braine & O'Brien, 1998). Furthermore,
they suggest that a MP inference can be triggered by
subliminal stimuli and carried out without subjects being
aware of it. Other valid deductive inferences – such as
modus tollens – do not share these characteristics. The
automaticity of the MP, and its reliance on a specific,
dedicated logical circuit, supports the idea that some very
basic, intuitively valid logical schemata might constitute at
least part of the core of human reasoning competence.
Our results extend the list of the cognitive activities that
can be performed without consciousness. While it is largely
accepted that subliminal stimuli can activate lower-level
processing (Greenwald, 1992), the possibility that
subliminal stimuli can also trigger semantic (Dell'Acqua &
Grainger, 1999; Naccache & Dehaene, 2001b) or inferential
(e.g. deduction, as in the present study) computations is
debated (for a review see Kouider & Dehaene, 2007).
However, in recent years, an increasing number of studies is
providing evidence of the subliminal activation of highlevel processing, including decision making (Dijksterhuis,
Bos, Nordgren, & van Baaren, 2006; Soon, Brass, Heinze,
& Haynes, 2008), motivation (Pessiglione et al., 2007),
emotion (Etkin et al., 2004), and extraction of formal
features from audio streams (Pena, Bonatti, Nespor, &
Mehler, 2002). This study indicates that a critical
component of deductive reasoning – the modus ponens –
can be triggered by a non-conscious stimulus and performed
without voluntary control.

Conclusions
The present study provides evidence that the modus
ponens (“if p then q; p; therefore q”), contrary to any other
valid or invalid inference that we tested, is an automatic
information processing step that can be performed even
where individuals are not aware of a subliminal second
premise (“p”), as long as they paid attention to the first
premise (“if p then q”) and correctly retained it in working
memory. These results extend the variety of known highlevel cognitive tasks that can be performed unconsciously,
by adding a critical component of deductive reasoning.
