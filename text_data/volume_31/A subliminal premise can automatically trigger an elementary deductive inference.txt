then not q. The second premises (P2) were either identical
(match trials) or different (mismatch trials) to one of the
numbers (p, q) involved in P1. In particular, in match trials,
each P1 type was followed half of the time by “p” and half
of the time by “q”. Thus P2 matched either the first or
second literal of P1. In the mismatch trials each P1 type was
followed by an “r”, i.e. a number that was not mentioned in
P1. Overall the manipulations on P1 and P2 generated 12
pairs of premises. The target was different depending on
whether the trial consisted in number evaluation or sentence
recognition. In the sentence recognition trials, the target was
composed of two conditional sentences. One of the two
sentences was identical to the P1 used in the same trial. In
the number evaluation trials, each one of the 12 pairs of
premises was coupled half of the time with a “p” target
number, and the other half with a “q” target number,
accounting for 24 types of trials. Furthermore, in the case of
mismatch conditions, the target number could also be an “r”
or an “s”: i.e., a number identical to P2 (“r”) or a number
not presented in the two premises (“s”). Thus overall, 32                                Figure 1. An example trial
