Six sentences in the parallel condition were drawn from
Smyth (1994), and eight from Kehler et al. (2008). Only one
of Kehler et al.’s sentences was used in the result condition,
because the other sentences included intransitive clauses, and
were therefore not amenable to this experiment. The proper
names in the first sentence had the same gender so that there
was a potential ambiguity in the referent of the pronoun. The
proper names used were chosen to be unambiguously male or             Figure 2: Analysis of prosodic naturalness. 1 = Unnatural, 5
