Abstract: Joint perception is the phenomena that gaze is influenced by the belief that one is either looking at
pictures alone, or that a person next door is looking at the same pictures. In our experiments, participants look at
sets of four pictures of different valences. On a trial by trial basis, participants are told that either they are looking at
the same pictures as another participant sat next door, or that only they are looking at the pictures. When looking
jointly, participants spent more time looking at positive pictures, but this preference reversed when they believed
they were looking alone. In the current work, we have investigated how this phenomena interacts with participants
assumptions about their task. We manipulated whether they thought we were comparing their preferences or testing
their memory for pictures. We conclude that social context and task construal exert a strong influences on perceptual
processes.
