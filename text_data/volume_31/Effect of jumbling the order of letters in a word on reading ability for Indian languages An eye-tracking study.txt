Abstract: The paper describes various reading experiments to investigate human reading patterns for Hindi and
Telugu. Experiments are based on different types of word jumbling. Results from these experiments bring out some
interesting observations which are related to orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse. These
patterns were noticed across majority of the subjects. Some of these observations are unique to Hindi and Telugu.
