encourages expressing sympathy, rather than

     Consider these maxims within the context
of a tutorial dialogue. Expressing confusion
after a tutor attempts to explain a concept could
be seen as a violation of the approbation

as a criticism of the tutor’s ability to explain.
Thus, even if a student is aware of being
confused by something the tutor says, the
student might not express that confusion freely.
