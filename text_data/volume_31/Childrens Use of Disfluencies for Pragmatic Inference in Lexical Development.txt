      Disfluencies in child-directed and child-
                     produced speech
The results of our eye-tracking study indicate that young
children learn that speech disfluencies contain information
about upcoming referents, but, at present, the source of this
learning is unknown. As discussed above, disfluencies are
abundant in speech among adults. Young children’s
demonstrated sensitivity to disfluencies, then, could indicate
that they learn about disfluencies from adult-directed
speech. In fact, some experimental evidence demonstrates
that young children (1;10) attend to disfluencies in speech
between adults (Soderstrom & Morgan, 2007). This
hypothesis may seem particularly attractive given that child-
directed speech is characterized by a slow speech rate and
short utterances, both of which correlate with more fluent
speech. This fact may explain why fluency is widely
regarded as a hallmark of child-directed speech.
   The true frequency with which disfluencies occur in
child-directed speech, however, is unclear. Although child-
directed speech is undeniably more fluent than adult-
directed speech, disfluencies occur in speech to children             Figure 3: Log probability of a filled pause in child-directed
