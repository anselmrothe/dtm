inference learning may focus categorizers on within-

within-category information acquired by inference learners
is not tied to any particular set of contrast categories, such
knowledge yields a more general and flexible
representation. As a consequence, with respect to novel
contrasts, inference learners may be at an advantage over
classification learners.

involved category B versus C, B versus D, and A versus D.                        Figure 2. Proportion correct by block.

dimension or the CD relevant dimension. A second attention
optimization obtained for classification subjects.
   We next examined whether the inference condition
yielded any kind of attention optimization. Recall that the
contrast dimension was never queried. If inference
motivates a general interest in the category features, we
should observe continued fixations to the contrast
dimension, in spite of it now being task-irrelevant.
However, Figure 3 (bottom) shows that throughout learning,
inference learners largely ignored the contrast dimension.
Although attention to dimensions 1 and 2 remained high
throughout learning, even in the first learning block
inference learners largely ignored the contrast dimension. In
fact, in the first block of learning, the amount of time
fixating the contrast dimension was already significantly
less than that of fixating the other two dimensions and the
category label (all ps < .01). Apparently, inference learners
do in fact optimize their attention away from task-irrelevant
cues.
   Attention optimization in the inference task contradicts
the idea that inference motivates a general interest in the
category features beyond what is strictly necessary. Rather,
                                                                                 Figure 3. Fixations by task, block, and location.

struggle to include the contrast dimension, since they largely
ignored it during training. On the other hand, although the
inference learners never directed their attention to the
contrast dimension, because it was not part of the task, they
never had to learn to direct their attention away from that
dimension either. Rather, the task focused their attention
more on the two queried cues, and inference subject learned
which dimensions were task-relevant. It is this fact that may
still allow inference learning to nevertheless produce
flexible attention allocation. By not learning to ignore the
contrast dimension, inference learners may be free to use it
during the switch trials.
   Blocks 10 and 11 of Figure 2 show proportion correct for
switch-classification. In spite of not deploying significant
fixations to the contrast dimension during training, the
inference condition nevertheless showed an advantage
during the switch trials. In the first block of switch trials, the
