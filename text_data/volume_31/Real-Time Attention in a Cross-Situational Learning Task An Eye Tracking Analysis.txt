Abstract: In order to determine the meanings of words of their native languages, learners must extract information
from noisy, complex environments. To be successful, they must direct their attention moment-by-moment to the
most informative subset of this data. Using eye-tracking information from participants engaged in a cross-situational
language learning task, we ask how attention and learning are dynamically coupled in real-time. In the cross-
situational word-learning paradigm, learners are exposed to a series of trials containing multiple objects and multiple
words each. While each trial is individually ambiguous (as it contains many potential word-object mappings), correct
mappings can be determined over time by computing association frequencies between words and objects across the
whole training set. Synchrony between spoken word onsets and object fixation inform a model in which word-object
associations are increased as a function of visual attention. This model is then used to predict the learning outcomes
of individual participants.
