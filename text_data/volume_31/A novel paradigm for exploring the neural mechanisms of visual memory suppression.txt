Abstract: Recent neuroimaging work using the Think/No-Think (TNT) paradigm has shown that when people
suppress retrieval of unwanted memories, hippocampal activation is reduced. It remains unclear, however, whether
retrieval suppression also modulates regions of neocortex supporting the representation of the memory itself. To
examine this issue, we developed a modified TNT paradigm wherein people attempt to suppress the retrieval of faces
and scenes. Faces and scenes are ideal stimuli in that the cortical bases for processing these types of stimuli are
well documented, providing specific brain regions in which to search for evidence of neocortical suppression. Here we
report a behavioral experiment using these stimuli. Results showed impaired memory for those pictures participants
tried to suppress, compared to pictures from baseline pairs, extending retrieval suppression effects to memories of
faces and scenes. This paradigm validates a procedure that can be used to target neocortical contributions to retrieval
suppression using fMRI.
