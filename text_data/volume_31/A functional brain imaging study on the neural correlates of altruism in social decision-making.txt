Results
Table 3 summarizes the behavioral data collected during
scanning. Overall, the participants generated more altruistic
decisions than egoistic decisions (Wilcoxon-Test: Z = -
2.809; p < 0.01). Moreover, although subjects were allowed
to respond at their own pace, the non-social decisions took
more time than the social decisions. The differences in the
response times are statistically significant (mean of the al-
truistic and egoistic versus individual response time t-Test: t
= -2.512; p < 0.05), while the separate differences in re-
sponse times nearly reach the 5% level of significance (al-
truistic versus non-social, t-Test: t = -2.115; p = 0.064; and
egoistic versus non-social, t-Test: t = 2.216; p = 0.054).

each problem was embedded into another situation. These              quired regulative control to suppress amoral behavior.
“cover stories” were quite realistic: they were presented to
the participants as narrative episodes and the participants
were requested to play the role of the protagonist.
   The imaging data show that a complex neural network of
cortical and sub-cortical brain areas is involved in making
altruistic or egoistic decisions. The activated cortical brain
areas were portions of the orbito-frontal cortex (BA 11,
right), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46, right), and
the posterior parietal cortex (BA 7, 40, bilaterally). Here an
increase of activation was found for social problems and
altruistic choices. The sub-cortical brain areas included por-
tions of the amygdala. Here social problems overall resulted
in a decrease of activation in the dorsal amygdala whereas
the altruistic decisions led to a relative decrease of activa-
tion in the ventral portions of the right amygdala.
          The most plausible explanation for the increase of
activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during social
and altruistic choices is that our participants had to make a
decision under conditions in which a conflict of interest
occurred and that they thus might have taken into account
the potential reward value of the different alternatives of
action. With this interpretation we follow the suggestions of
Elliott, Dolan, & Frith (2000), who argued that social deci-
sions are based on a feeling of “rightness” and that this is an
example of a selection on the basis of the likely reward
value (Elliott et al., 2000; p. 308). In fact, our finding is in
good agreement with the widely accepted position that the
OFC is involved whenever individuals have to generate be-
havior that is flexible and adaptive rather than “slavishly
determined by the current input” (Elliott et al., 2000; p.
308). Many different theories have characterized the OFC as
a flexible control system that is involved in executive con-
trol (Baddeley, 1986), supervisory attention (Shallice,
1988), and top-down regulation of decision processes (Frith
