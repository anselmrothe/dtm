Abstract: Abstract: When a person forms a mental representation, a full set of features may not be instantiated
instantaneously. Rather, high features may arrive to the self-organizing representation at a quicker rate than low
features, where high and low refer to the intercorrelational strength between a given feature and all the other features
relevant to the concept within the system (McRae, de Sa & Seidenberg 1997). We tracked streaming x,y coordinates
of human arm movements in a picture-labeling task whereby participants classified pictures (e.g. a picture of lettuce)
into response boxes providing potential lexical labels (e.g. green vs. lettuce). For features that describe surface
properties of the object, maximum hand-movement deviation occurred significantly earlier to high features than to
low features, t(39)=2.43, p=.019. Thus, the real-time construction of a mental representation may be described by
‚Äùsubattractor dynamics, with asymmetries in the dynamic time-scales of underlying features.
