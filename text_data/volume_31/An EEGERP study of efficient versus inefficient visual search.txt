respectively. Eff-4 corresponds to a popout condition, and
Ineff-4 corresponds to a conjunctive search condition.
Each trial commenced with a fixation period (1500 ms)
where participants focused on a small white ring placed at
the center of the screen. The fixation was then replaced
by a target cue (1000 ms), positioned at the screen center.
The target was then replaced by a second fixation delay period (1000 ms). Following this delay period, a search set of
items was displayed for 2500 ms, or until a key was pressed,
whichever came first. Participants were required to identify
the target location within this time period by pressing a key
corresponding to the quadrant within which the target was
located. Speed and accuracy of response were stressed. Participants pressed either key ‘a’ (upper left), or ‘z’ (lower left)
with their left hand; or ‘k’ (upper right), or ‘m’ (lower right)
with their right hand to identify the respective quadrants. The
assignment of stimulus items to quadrants was randomized
and responses were counterbalanced across trials. Trial timing and example search displays are shown in Figure 1. Trials
were blocked by display type. There were 64 trials per block.
A prompt, displayed for 10 s, indicated the start of the next
block. There were 3 blocks for each display type, totaling 6
blocks per session. Each participant did two sessions, separated by about 5 min of rest. Thus, each participants received
768 experiment trials (= 2 sessions x 6 blocks x 64 trials). Response keys and times were recorded. Pressing an incorrect
key, or failure to respond within the maximum allotted time
was regarded as an error.

done after removing error and outlier trials. Data were entered into two (display type) by two (display size) repeated
measures ANOVAs to infer
√ significant effects. For errors, an
arcsine transform (arcsin x) was applied to error rates before
computing analyses of variance. Newman-Keuls tests were
employed for all post hoc analyses unless otherwise stated.
EEG/ERP EEG data were re-referenced offline to the mean
of earlobe potentials A1 and A2. Event-related potentials
(ERP) were time-locked to the onset of search display for
stimulus-locked ERP analysis, or response key for responselocked ERP analysis. For stimulus-locked ERP analysis, a
data window was set at -200 ms to 1000 ms relative to stimulus onset. For response-locked ERP analysis, a window was
set at -500 ms to 50 ms relative to response onset. Trials containing artifacts (approximately 25% of trials, identified by
visual inspection) or response errors were excluded from further analysis. Eye-movement artifacts were removed using
Independent Components Analysis.
The amplitudes and latencies of P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3
components were estimated at the most dominant midline
sites (Fz for P2 and N2; and Pz for P1, N1, and P3). The P1,
P2, and P3 components were defined as the largest positivegoing peaks occurring within a 80–180 ms, 100–250 ms, and
200–800 ms latency window, respectively. The N1 and N2
components were defined as the largest negative-going peaks
occurring within a 120–240 ms and 150–400 ms latency window, respectively. The peak amplitudes and latencies for each
participant in each condition were entered into ANOVAs. Of
particular interest to this study is the P3 component as an indicator of the onset and duration of working memory processes.
For this component, more specific analyses were conducted
in addition to an ANOVA for peak amplitude. The jackknife
method (Miller, Patterson, & Ulrich, 1998) was used to estimate the P3 onset latency. Here, we used an absolute criterion
of 6 µV (approximately half of peak amplitude) instead of a
relative criterion, which has been recommended in general
(Kiesel, Miller, Jolicoeur, & Brisson, 2008). The P3 component may diminish in amplitude and increase in latency with
larger display sets, possibly due to jitter generated by shifting
attention to other items to be matched to a target (Kok, 2001).
In this case, an absolute criterion is more likely to index the
onset of the first attended item to be matched to the target.
To estimate the duration of working memory processes, we
use the amount of activity integrated over time (i.e., the area
under the ERP curve). These estimates are then entered into
an ANOVA to determine effects on working memory duration. Following the jackknife procedure (Kiesel et al., 2008),
ANOVAs of P3 onset latency used the corrected F-test (Fc).
For rLRP, the activity was calculated as the contralateral minus ipsilateral central electrode relative to the overt response.
That is, C4 - C3 (C3 - C4) for left (right) responses. Similar
to the analysis of P3, the jackknife method with an absolute
criterion of -1.75 µV (approximately half of peak amplitude)
was used to estimate rLRP onset latency. The onset latencies
for each participant in each condition were entered into an

Electroencephalograms (EEG) were measured from the
following 19 electrode sites of the International 10-20 system: Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5,
P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, and O2, with AFz as the ground electrode. Electrooculograms (EOGs) were recorded to monitor
possible eye movement artifacts. Electrodes were attached
with gel to reduce impedance to below 5 kΩ. EEG and EOG
were digitized at a rate of 1000 Hz, and were band-pass filtered at 0.032 Hz and 300 Hz. The experiment was conducted

(a)

An ANOVA revealed significant effects of display type,
F(1, 10) = 10.61, p < .009, and display size, F(1, 10) = 5.01,
p < .049, on errors. The error rate was greater in the inefficient than efficient condition, and greater in set size two
than four condition. The interaction of type and size was not
significant, F(1, 10) = 1.51, p = .248. For response times,
there were significant effects of type, F(1, 10) = 101.28, p <
.00001, and size, F(1, 10) = 73.64, p = .00001. There was
also a significant type by size interaction, F(1, 10) = 55.90,
p = .00002. Post hoc analysis revealed significant differences
between Ineff-2 and Ineff-4, p = .0004, Eff-2 and Ineff-2, p =
.002, and Eff-4 and Ineff-4, p = .0002, but not between Eff2 and Eff-4, p = .873. Mean untransformed error rates and
response times are shown in Table 1.

since items were more similar to the target than in the Eff-2
or Eff-4 conditions. However, Ineff-4 peak was smaller than
in the Eff-4 peak, and the Ineff-2 peak was smaller than the
Eff-2 peak.
P2 and N2 For P2, an ANOVA of peak amplitude for the
channel with the largest peak amplitude at midline, Fz, indicated significant main effects of type, F(1, 10) = 10.87,
p = .008, and size, F(1, 10) = 5.85, p = .036, but no significant interaction, F(1, 10) = 0.22, p = .646. There were no
significant main effects on peak latency for type, F(1, 10) =
0.76, p = .404, or size, F(1, 10) = 1.81, p = .208. For
N2, there were no significant main effects on peak amplitude, F(1, 10) = 1.44, p = .258 (type), F(1, 10) = 0.002,
p = .969 (size), and F(1, 10) = 0.001, p = .973 (interaction). There were no significant effects on peak latency,

EEG/ERP
P1 and N1 For the P1 component, a two-way ANOVA for
the dominant channel (largest peak amplitude at the midline), Pz, revealed a significant effect of set size on amplitude,
F(1, 10) = 20.94, p = .001. There was no effect of set type,
F(1, 10) = 1.01, p = .339, and no interaction, F(1, 10) =
0.52, p = .488. For latency, a two-way ANOVA did not reveal significant effects for type, F(1, 10) = 0.14, p = .713, or
size, F(1, 10) = 0.70, p = .422. For the N1 component, an
ANOVA at Pz did not reveal any significant effects for type,
F(1, 10) = 1.80, p = .209, size, F(1, 10) = 0.12, p = .913,
or their interaction, F(1, 10) = 0.68, p = .430 on peak amplitude. There was a significant effect of size on latency,
F(1, 10) = 8.42, p = .016, but not type, F(1, 10) = 0.01,
p = .942. The type by size interaction was not significant,
F(1, 10) = 0.68, p = .430. Mean P1 and N1 peak amplitudes
and latencies are shown in Table 2(a).
A likely explanation for the effects of P1 and N1 is that they
reflect stimulus intensity, or overall display luminance, which
is greater in set size four than two conditions. Although P1
and N1 indicate location-modulated stimulus processing (i.e.,
larger peaks when attending to the location of a stimulus than
when attending to an empty location), the effects are supposed to be contralateral to stimulus location (Luck, Woodman, & Vogel, 2002). No such systematic differences were
observed here. Another explanation for the N1 component is
as an indicator of item discrimination (Vogel & Luck, 2000).
It is unlikely that discrimination is the basis of the latency effect observed here. Discriminability should be more difficult

The larger P2 peaks for efficient than inefficient conditions
and the lack of a peak latency effect suggest that processes
specific to inefficient search were not invoked at this point. If
the P2 peak for inefficient search was larger, then this result
may suggest, for example, greater top-down control of attention during inefficient search. Instead, the evidence suggests
that components specific to inefficient search must emerge
at a later stage of the overall visual search process. P2 amplitudes also correlated with number of non-target features.
Peak order (non-target features) were: Eff-2 (2) < Eff-4 (6)
and Ineff-2 (1) < Ineff-4 (3), contrasting set size; and Eff-2
(2) > Ineff-2 (1) and Eff-4 (6) > Ineff-4 (3), contrasting set
type, suggesting that P2 reflects top-down processes driving
feature suppression as the basis for selective attention.
P3 For the channel with the highest peak amplitude at midline, Pz, there was a significant effect of type, F(1, 10) =

19.97, p = .001, but not size, F(1, 10) = 0.03, p = .873, nor
interaction, F(1, 10) = 2.03, p = .184. There were no significant effects on P3 peak latency, F(1, 10) = 2.66, p = .134
(type), F(1, 10) = 1.10, p = .320 (size), and F(1, 10) =
0.49, p = .498 (interaction). There were no significant effects on P3 onset latency, Fc(1, 10) = 0.08, p = .778 (type),
Fc(1, 10) = 0.59, p = .459 (size), and Fc(1, 10) = 1.95, p =
.193 (interaction). Figure 2 shows the ERPs in the four search
conditions for the Pz channel. Evidently, although the latencies were similar, the peaks were more extended over time
in the two inefficient search conditions. An analysis of activity integrated over time (area under the curve) for the time
period 200-800 ms after stimulus onset showed a significant
effect of type, F(1, 10) = 36.55, p = .0001, and a marginally
significant effect of size, F(1, 10) = 4.38, p = .063, but no
interaction, F(1, 10) = 1.80, p = .210. P3 peak amplitudes,
areas, and peak and onset latencies are shown in Table 2(c).

aged peak potentials will be lower but more distributed over
time, which is consistent with the observed type and size effects on integrated activity. In terms of P3 peak amplitude,
our results are consistent with Hoffman et al. (1989). Wolber
and Wascher (2003) also observed decreased P3 peak amplitude with set size (from 5 to 30 items) for inefficient (conjunctive) search. Luck and Hillyard (1990), by contrast, observed increased P3 peak amplitude with set size for inefficient search. But, as Luck and Hillyard also noted, these disparate results may be due to a difference in the set size range
in relation to memory capacity. In our case, and also that of
Hoffman et al. (1989), displays contained no more than four
items. For Luck and Hillyard (1990), display sizes were at
least eight, and so more likely required serial attention. In
the parallel case, the smaller amplitude may be due to a form
of resource (re)allocation (Kok, 2001; Polich, 2007), where
attention is (spatially) distributed among more items resulting in a smaller peak. Yet, because the attended items are
more similar to each other the time to determine the target is
longer, hence the greater amount of activity over time in the
inefficient conditions.
From the combination of P3 peak amplitudes and areas, we
surmise that the durations of working memory processes were
longer in the inefficient conditions. This difference in duration is implied by observing that the amplitudes were lower
and areas greater in the inefficient conditions, therefore the
durations must be longer.

Previous research has identified a variety of task conditions
affecting P3 amplitude and latency, including task relevancy,
target probability, task difficulty, practice and perceptual and
memory load (see Kok, 2001; Polich, 2007, for reviews).
Against this background, it is surprising that we observed no
significant difference in P3 onset latency for efficient and inefficient visual search. We suppose that P3 reflects a working memory process for matching attended items to the target held in short term memory (Kok, 2001). A model that
involves either parallel or serial matching may be consistent
with this result. In the parallel case, the matching process is
engaged regardless of the items selected for attention, so P3
onset latency is independent of set type, or size. In the serial case, P3 onset latency may reflect matching of the first
attended item to the target, so here too onset latency does not
change with set type, or size. In regard to P3 peak latency, it
is perhaps also surprising that we did not find a significant effect given that Hoffman, Simons, and Houck (1989) observed
increased P3 peak latency with set size (one, or four) in the inefficient condition. Although in our case, the trend was in the
same direction (i.e., Ineff-4 > Ineff-2), the two results may
not be comparable. For Hoffman et al. (1989), peak latencies
were greater than overt response times, suggesting that their
latency results reflect additional generators of P3 not specific
to working memory.

There are two possible explanations for the difference in P3
peak amplitude that derive from serial versus parallel models
of search, again assuming P3 reflects matching processes. In
the serial case, the smaller peak amplitude may result from
trial-by-trial latency variation. We supposed that P2 reflected
selective attention via distractor feature suppression. For the
efficient conditions, selective attention leaves only one candidate item for subsequent matching to the target, since none
of the distractors have a target feature. In the inefficient
conditions, selective attention does not eliminate any items,
because all items share at least one feature with the target.
Consequently, the target may not be located until the second,
third, or even fourth attempted match. In this case, the aver-

rLRP The analysis of rLRP latency revealed a significant
effect of search type, Fc(1, 10) = 5.15, p = .047, but no effect of size, Fc(1, 10) = 0.31, p = .589, and no interaction,
Fc(1, 10) = 0.09, p = .772. The mean latencies are shown in
Table 2(d).
The rLRP component has been useful for contrasting the
time-course of response for partial versus complete, or consistent versus inconsistent information (Coles, Gratton, &
Donchin, 1988). If the responses designated to opposing

386

hands are associated with different sources of information,
then the ipsilateral from contralateral subtraction average, after counterbalancing for response sides, eliminates activity
from processes common to both types of response, leaving
activity that is specific to their differences. In our case, the
competing sources were target (contralateral response) versus
distractor (ipsilateral response) information. The interpretation of the difference depends on the underlying process of
response selection. Supposing the speed of response is influenced by the discriminability between competing choices,
then response selection will be longer in the inefficient search
conditions. The situation is more complicated here, because of potential competition both between and within visual fields, in the set size four conditions. Regardless of the
underlying response mechanism, though, it is clear that response selection is a contributing factor to search efficiency.

then passed on to a second stage for serial processing of feature conjunctions. Thus, if the target is identifiable by a single
feature, then search proceeds independently of the number
of display items. Otherwise, each conjunction must be compared to the target separately, so response time is proportional
to display set size. This two-stage framework predicts two
distinct response modes (i.e., characterized by a relatively
flat versus a relatively steep slope). Yet, a meta-analysis of
response time data (Wolfe, 1998) failed to reveal a bimodal
distribution of response time slopes. Our ERP results also
do not support this sort of theory, where presumably there
should be a difference between the onset of P3, and possibly
P2 or N2, depending on how these components are supposed
to correspond with the two stages.
The meta-analysis lended more support for a theory where
features and conjunctions are processed within the same stage
(e.g., Guided Search, Wolfe, et al, 1989), indicated by a
unimodal distribution of response time slopes. For Guided
Search, the first stage involves computing a noisy ranking of
the similarity of each item to the target. The second stage
involves matching the items to the target in rank order. But
the processing stages are the same for feature or conjunction
search. In terms of the distinction between selective attention
(P2 and N2) and working memory (P3), our results are perhaps more compatible with the Guided Search model, where
the early ERP components correspond to ranking the similiarity of each item to the target and P3 corresponds to matching
each item to the target in order of rank. Assuming that ranking is a parallel process, then the onset of the earlier components will be the same across set type and size conditions. For
Guided Search, response time is also determined by a serial
process that matches each item to the target in order of similarity until a match is found. Interpreting P3 as an indicator
of this matching process implies that onset will be the same
across type and size conditions, but duration will be longer
for inefficient search where the matching item is more likely

Figure 3: Onset latencies for P1, P2, P3 and rLRP.

The analyses of the previous section identified a number of
significant differences in ERP components for efficient and
inefficient visual search. A summary is provided in Table 3.
Figure 3 shows the ERP components, P1, P2, P3, and rLRP
and their temporal relationships for each condition. From this
perspective several general characteristics of visual search efficiency emerge. First, P1, P2, and P3 onsets were similar
across the four conditions. In terms of latency, there was no
difference between efficient and inefficient search up to the
engagement of working memory. Second, the differences between efficient and inefficient search arose during the execution of working memory, which in this case, we presume to
include matching of input stimuli to the target. Third, the onset of response selection was later for inefficient than efficient
search. We note that response selection appeared to partly
operate in parallel with matching. Fourth, response selection
took longer for inefficient than efficient search. Matching and
response selection are the two component processes that contribute to the difference in response times for efficient versus
inefficient search.

Although our study was not designed to test a specific theory or model of visual search, the results do speak against the
general two-stage framework that was the basis for the original Feature Integration theory (Treisman & Gelade, 1980).
By this theory, visual features are first processed in parallel,

387

to be further down the order.
In summary, selective attention (P2) based on feature information provides a fast mechanism for reducing the search
space. But, unlike Feature Integration theory (Treisman &
Gelade, 1980), it is not a complete route to target determination. Rather, it selects candidate items for subsequent matching to the target by working memory processes (P3). In the
efficient (popout) conditions, though, typically only one item
is selected, so matching and response selection may proceed
independently of set size. Matching initiates response selection, at least partly in parallel. But, the time course of matching and selection depends on the number of competing items
and their similarities. The onset of response selection may
indeed coincide with the onset of matching, and inefficient
search may include several intervening shifts of attention.
One potential confound with the effect of set type on P3
amplitude is a possible overlap with a slow negative wave
from controlled search processes (see Kok, 2001, for a review). In this case, changes in P3 may reflect searching rather
than matching processes. However, this interpretation does
not explain why the onsets of P3 and earlier components did
not change with search efficiency. A more likely explanation
is that controlled search processes are interspersed between
attempts by working memory processes to match items to the
target, hence P3 amplitude was lower for inefficient search
conditions, but P3 onset did not change.
The current results and analyses pertain to search efficiency
over small sets within working memory capacity. Yet, we expect that they generalize to larger set sizes. How then do we
reconcile the strong correlation between response time and
P3 peak latency observed in other studies (e.g., Luck & Hillyard, 1990)? We think that P3 peak latency is a reflection of
working memory duration, not onset. Larger sets may induce
more intervening shifts of attention, and the subjective probability of targets may indeed be the cause of P3 peak variation.
However, this cause is still compatible with our general claim
that the onset of P3, indicating engagement of working memory processes, does not change with set type, or size.
The relationship between P3, search and memory can
be tested more directly by contrasting ERP components in
target-present versus target-absent conditions for feature versus conjunction search. Wolfe’s meta-analysis also revealed
that the ratio of target-absent to target-present slopes differed
significantly between feature and conjunction search. In feature search, subjects terminated search in the absense of a target relatively earlier than for conjunction search, resulting in
a smaller ratio. If P3 reflects the matching of items to a target
in working memory, then we would expect no difference in P3
onset, but a longer duration for target-absent conditions, and
that this difference would be greater for conjunction search.
