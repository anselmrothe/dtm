differences between nouns and verbs. As the corpus study
showed, lexical verb frames are less diagnostic than lexical
noun frames overall, and thus lesser knowledge about verb
frames could be making it more difficult for infants to
segment verbs. The corpus study also suggests that using
inflectional forms like ING as units in computing transition
probabilities would ameliorate this difference. Doing so
would allow infants to make use of verbs’ most frequent and
most diagnostic frame. In Experiment 2 we tested this
hypothesis.

7.5 and 9.5-month-old infants were tested to etermine if they
could segment verbs if frame was the most informative one,
which includes ING. If so, this would show that infants’
difficulty with verbs (in our Experiment 1, and in Nazzi et
al) was due to differences in transition probabilities between
nouns and verbs, and that when this difference is equalized,
the noun-verb difference is eliminated.
