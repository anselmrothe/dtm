   The existing studies of memory-induced Simon-like
effects have demonstrated that a spatial compatibility effect
could be invoked not only by a present spatially incongruent
stimulus, but also by one which is retrieved from memory.
The second aim of this study was to investigate whether a
similar effect would be found even in the presence of
directly available spatial cues which determine the correct
response action.

experiment, participants viewed images of four objects
located on a 2x2 grid and tried to remember them.
Afterwards the objects disappeared and a single word
appeared in one of the 4 cells of the grid. The task of the
participants was to press a button if the word denoted some
of the objects and do nothing otherwise (a go/no-go task).
