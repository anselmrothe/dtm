Abstract: Prior research has shown that tutored problem-solving with intelligent software tutors is an effective
instructional method and that worked examples are an effective complement to this kind of tutored problem-solving.
Additionally, two recent studies revealed evidence which indicates that it is desirable to adapt fading of worked
examples to individual students evolving knowledge level. However, while often assumptions are made about the
prolonged use of worked examples no study has actually investigated the possible effects of an all examples approach.
In order to gain insight on these effects a study will be conducted which compares an all examples condition with a
pure problem solving condition and an adaptive fading of examples condition. The pretest, immediate and delayed
posttests will contain conceptual and procedural transfer items to fully explore the outcomes of the all examples
condition and enable a rich comparison with the other two experimental conditions.
