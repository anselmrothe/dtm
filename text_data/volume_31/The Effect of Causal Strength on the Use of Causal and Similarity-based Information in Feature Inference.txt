Abstract: Category-based feature generalizations are affected by similarity relationships between objects and by
knowledge of causal relationships between features. However, there is disagreement between recent studies about
whether people will simultaneously consider both relationships. To help resolve this discrepancy, the current study
addresses an important difference between past experimental designs: the strength of causal relationships between
features. Participants were trained on a set of four different kinds of artificial alien animals, and were taught
about three novel features. Participants were taught that either: 1) there were no relationships between the three
features; 2) the features shared weak causal relationships; or 3) the features shared strong causal relationships. After
training, all participants made feature predictions about the four kinds of animals, to test which relationships the
participants used. Three probabilistic graphical models were fit to participants’ predictions: one that considers
only the tree-structured similarities between objects, one that considers only the causal chain relationships between
features, and one that combines knowledge of both relationships. It was found that the strength of the causal
relationships influenced the degree to which participants’ feature generalizations were affected by causal and similarity
considerations.
