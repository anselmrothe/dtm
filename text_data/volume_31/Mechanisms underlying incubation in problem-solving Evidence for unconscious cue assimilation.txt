perform tasks during an incubation period (Browne &
Cruse, 1988). Other studies report the same level of
performance by participants with filled and unfilled
incubation periods (Olton & Johnson, 1976). Sio &
Ormerod (2009) found that different procedural moderators
affect incubation, but their meta-analysis provided more
support for the unconscious work hypothesis, although
effects are specific to particular problem types. With
linguistic insight problems such as remote associates tasks
(RATs), light-load tasks yield a stronger incubation effect
than rest or heavy load task. It is suggested that light load
incubation tasks divert individuals’ attention to other areas,
and this facilitates helpful unconscious processes. However,
with visual problems, incubation task load has no impact.
Three proposals for unconscious processes are spreading
activation (Smith, 1995; Yaniv & Meyer, 1987), selective
forgetting (Smith, 1995; Smith & Blankenship, 1991), and
opportunistic assimilation (Seifert et al., 1995). The
spreading activation hypothesis holds that during the
incubation period activation spreads to relevant memory
items. Partially activated items may combine or interact
with external cues to yield fortuitous insightful ideas. The
selective-forgetting hypothesis (Simon, 1966; Smith, 1995;
Smith & Blankenship, 1991) holds that an incubation period
provides time to forget over-activated irrelevant
concepts/strategies, and this allows a fresh view of the
problem. The opportunistic-assimilation hypothesis (Seifert
et al, 1995) emphasizes the role of initial failure in the
incubation effect, suggesting that impasse encountered at
the initial approach helps individuals to re-encode the
problem in a form that increases of the likelihood of
assimilating any cue encountered by chance.
Experimental paradigms of past incubation studies have
not discriminated between specific hypotheses. The settings
of the past incubation studies are fairly uniform: one group
of participants is interrupted with a break filled with other
tasks while solving the problem, whereas the other group
works on the problem continuously. This design cannot
determine what type of unconscious process underlies
performance improvements in incubation conditions. The
experiments reported in this paper use a lexical decision
task (LDT) introduced by Sio and Rudowicz (2007) to
assess sensitivity towards relevant memories before and
after an incubation period. Sio and Rudowicz found an
increase in sensitivity after incubation period, although they
did not investigate whether an incubation effect also arose.
If spreading-activation is the source of incubation effects,
then enhanced solutions to problems should be accompanied

Abstract
Two experiments tested whether spreading activation or cue
assimilation underlie incubation effects in problem solving.
After initial attempts to solve remote associates tasks,
participants performed lexical decision tasks that included
solution words, and attempted the remote associates again,
either immediately, after a delay with no interpolated task, or
after a delay with filler tasks. Spreading activation of target
lexical items was not influenced by incubation. However, the
presence of solution words in interpolated lexical decision
items gave rise to incubation effects with high cognitive-load
incubation tasks. The results support a cue-assimilation
process, in which unconscious processes access solution
relevant information during incubation, but only if conscious
task activity is suppressed. It is suggested that different
mechanisms may occur during an incubation period to
facilitate solution finding, depending on the nature of the
impasse encountered during initial attempts.

Introduction
Incubation arises when the solution to an unsolved
problem comes to mind after a temporary shift of attention
to other domain. The phenomenon is well-documented in
anecdotal reports of the intellectual discovery processes of
geniuses (e.g. Wallas, 1926; Ghiselin, 1985), and its
existence was confirmed by Sio and Ormerod (2009) in a
meta-analysis of past incubation studies. Two hypotheses
have been proposed to account for this seemingly
discontinuous and effortless problem-solving process. The
conscious-work account suggests that incubation helps
individuals recover from mental fatigue or provides extra
time for additional problem solving (Browne & Cruse,
1988; Posner, 1973). The unconscious-work account
suggests that incubation filler tasks force individuals to give
up active control on the problem, and this facilitates
gradual, unconscious problem-solving processes.
The conscious-work account predicts that an unfilled
incubation period generates a larger incubation effect than a
filled one, while the unconscious-work account makes the
opposite prediction. Neither account receives unequivocal
empirical support: some studies show that participants who
had a filled incubation period outperformed those who
rested or worked on the problem continuously (e.g., Patrick,
1986; Penney, et al., 2004; Smith & Blankenship, 1989).
Others report the opposite: participants who rest during an
incubation period perform better than those who had to

by decreased lexical decision latencies to solution-relevant
words. The presentation of LDTs containing solutionrelevant words could also serve as a relevant cue to the
problem, and this can be adapted for testing the
opportunistic–assimilation hypothesis. According to the
opportunistic-assimilation hypothesis, individuals who
receive relevant cues (presentation of the LDTs) after an
incubation period should outperform those who receive cues
in a no-incubation condition or those who do not receive
any cue after the incubation period.

to speak out their answer to a microphone connected to a
tape-recorder. When solving MRTs and LDTs, participants
entered their responses via the keyboard. The latency and
responses given by participants were recorded. Latency was
measured from the onset of the stimulus until the
participants responded. When solving ATs, participants
wrote down their answers on a sheet of paper.
In each set of experimental trials, 8 RATs were presented
in the same sequence for each participant. In each trial, the
three stimulus words of the RAT were presented
horizontally across the centre of the screen at the same time.
Participants had 30 seconds to solve the RAT after it was
presented, and could respond at any time by pressing the C
key, after which they spoke out their answer, and then
pressed the C key again. In the Immediate Condition,
participants were prompted to do an LDT set followed by a
second attempt to the RAT, or vice versa depending on
whether it was an LDT-before (the 1st, 2nd , 5th , and 8th
RATs) or LDT-after (3rd , 4th , 6th , and 7th RATs) trial,
immediately after completion of their first attempt at the
RAT. In the Rest Condition, participants were prompted to
sit quietly and listen to soft music for two minutes before
proceeding to complete the LDT set or the same RAT. In
the Incubation Condition, participants were prompted to
complete MRTs for one minute and ATs for another minute
(incubation period) before proceeding to complete the LDT
set or the same RAT. Figure 1 presents the task sequence in
each condition.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants
48 (F: 37, M: 11) undergraduates from Lancaster University
were recruited. The mean age was 19.33 (SD=1.48).
Design
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three
conditions; immediate re-presentation of unsolved RATs, a
rest period between initial and repeated attempts, or an
incubation period filled with unrelated tasks. Participants in
each group were further assigned to one of two groups
receiving different sets of RATs matched for similar levels
of difficulty, to check that effects are not item-specific.
Materials
Remote Associates Tasks (RATs; Mednick, 1962) were
used as the problem-solving task in this study. In each RAT,
three apparently unrelated words are presented, and
participants have to think of a fourth word that forms an
association with each of the three words. For example, if
the three stimulus words of a RAT are “blue”, “cake” and
“cottage”, the fourth word can be “cheese”. 16 RATs were
selected from a pool created by Bowden and Jung-Beeman
(2003). The RATs were randomly divided into two sets, Set
A & B. The reported solution rates ranged between 10%31%, with a mean of 17.75 (SD = 6.32) for Set A, and 22.63
(SD = 8.18) for Set B. The mean solution rate between these
two sets was not significant, t(15) = 1.33, p = .20.
Lexical Decision Tasks (LDTs) were adapted to examine
participants’ level of sensitivity to relevant solution
concepts. A set of LDTs, consisting of five items including
neutral words, pseudo-words, and the answer of the
unsolved RAT (target words), was presented after each
initial attempt at a RAT. All presented words were high
frequency words (an occurrence of 90 or more in a million).
Mental rotation tasks (MRTs) and arithmetic tasks (ATs)
were used as incubation tasks. Each MRT consisted of a
pair of objects. Participants had to judge if the objects in
each pair were identical. The ATs comprised three-digit
additions and subtractions.

The five items in each LDT set were presented at the
centre of the screen, one at a time. Before presenting each
stimulus, a fixation cross was presented at the centre of the
screen for 1 second to draw participants’ attention. The first
presented item was always a neutral word or pseudo-word,
which served as a warm-up stimulus. The target word, along
with pseudo-words and neutral words, was counter-balanced
across the remaining four positions.

Results and Discussion
If incubation tasks facilitate the proposed unconscious
problem processes, participants in the Incubation condition
should perform better than participants in the other
conditions. Also, they should be more sensitive to the target
words if spreading activation occurs. The opportunisticassimilation hypothesis predicts that participants who were
in the Incubation condition and received cues before reapproaching the RAT had largest performance improvement.

Procedure
Experiment 1 was run on a computer using bespoke
software. In the presentation of each RAT, participants had

Opposite to these, the conscious-work account predicts that
participants in the Rest condition would outperform
participants in other conditions in RAT solving.
Performance Improvement
To test for the presence of incubation effects, participants’
performance (number of correct responses) in solving the
3rd, 4th ,6th, and 7th RATs were compared across the three
conditions (see Table 1 for the M and SD in each condition).

items in 1st attempt) in the 1st , 2nd , 5th , and 8th RATs
(LDT-after: no Cue) and 3rd , 4th , 6th , and 7th RATs (LDTbefore: Cue) were compared (see Table 3 for Ms and SDs).

None of the main and the interaction effects was significant,
implying that participants’ lexical decision times for target
and neutral words were comparable among the three
conditions. This suggests that participants in the Incubation
Condition were not more sensitized to target words.

A 3(Condition) x 2(Time) x 2(Question Set) ANOVA with

number of correct responses to RATs as DV, was carried
out. The Question Set effect was not significant, p = .17,
showing that the number of solved RATs in set A and B was
comparable. The Time effect was not significant, p =.63,
implying that there was no performance improvement in the
2nd attempt. This pattern of performance was found in all the
conditions, indicated by the non-significant Time x
Condition effect, p < .58.

Spreading Activation
Although no incubation effect on the performance level was
found, it is still possible that spreading-activation occurred
during the incubation period to sensitize participants to
relevant knowledge. To examine this possibility,
participants’ sensitivity to relevant memory items in each
condition (the lexical latency for the target words of the 1st,
2nd, 5th , and 8th RATs), was examined. Incorrect lexical
decisions, and correct decision with extreme lexical decision
time (< 50 or >2500 ms) were discarded as outliers (2.6%).
The lexical decision time was then log-transformed for
diminishing skew. Table 2 presents the M and SD of the
lexical decision time for neutral and target words in each
sub-group.

To examine the opportunistic-assimilation hypothesis, a
2(Question Set) x 2(Cue) x 3 (Condition) ANOVA with
repeated measures on Cue (no Cue vs Cue), using
improvement score as DV, was carried out. If the incubation
period facilitated cue-assimilate, then a significant Cue x
Condition effect is expected. Yet, the main and interaction
effects of these two factors were not significant, suggesting
that participants in the Incubation condition were not more
likely to assimilate the cues. This is not in line with the
opportunistic-assimilation hypothesis.

Experiment 2
Experiment 1 failed to demonstrate an incubation effect, but
this null effect may be related to the difficulty of the RATs
used, reflected in the low number of correct responses. An
incubation period might not be helpful if the problems are
so difficult that individuals do not have the required
knowledge to solve it. Also, consistent failures in problem

solving may lower problem solvers’ motivation, and in turn,
affect their performance.
Experiment 2 was conducted to replicate Experiment 1
using easier RATs, and to examine the link between the
loading of the incubation tasks and the incubation effect.
The paradigm of Experiment 2 was similar to the one in
Experiment 1, except having two modifications. First, there
was an adjustment on the difficulty of the RATs. In
Experiment 2, easier RATs were selected from the RAT
pool given by Bowden and Jung-Beeman (2003). Two sets
of RATs were prepared, an Intermediate set (solution rate:
25.5%-45%) and an Easy set (solution rate: 55%-75.5%).
There was no Rest condition, but two Incubation conditions
were run, with incubation periods filled by either high- or
low-load tasks. The Immediate condition remained the same
as in Experiment 1 and served as a control condition.

condition would be the largest among the three conditions.
The conscious-work account also predicts a larger
incubation effect in the Low-Load condition, but with the
absence of any proposed unconscious processes. Combining
the findings on the performance and cognitive levels allows
us to test these two opposite accounts.
Participants’ RAT performance was first examined to
check: 1) that the RATs in Experiment 2 were indeed easier
than those in Experiment I; 2) easy RATs were easier than
intermediate RATs. The mean number of correctly solved
RATs in the 1st attempt in Experiment 2 (M = 3.1, SD
=2.15) was higher than the mean in Experiment 1 (M =.96,
SD = 1.25), t(136) = 7.40, p < .001. The mean number of
solved items in the easy RAT set (M = 4.39, SD = 1.99) was
higher than the mean in the intermediate RAT set (M= 1.75,
SD=1.31), t(88) = 7.38, p < .001.

Method

Performance Improvement
Correct responses to the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th RATs among the
three conditions are shown in Table 4. A 3 (Condition) x 2
(Time) x 2 (Difficulty) ANOVA with repeated measures on
Time (1st vs. 2nd attempt), using number of correct responses
as DV, was conducted. Non-significant effects of Condition
x Time, p = .33, and Condition x RAT Difficulty x Time, p
=.59, indicate that, in both RAT sets, participants’
performance among the three conditions was comparable.

Participants
81 (F: 69, M: 12) undergraduates from Lancaster University
were recruited, and the mean age was 19.61(SD= 1.73).
Materials
MRTs and ATs were again used as incubation tasks. The
MRTs used in Experiment I were divided into two sets, the
High- and Low-Load sets, based on participants’ MRT
performance (response time and correct rate) in Experiment
I. High-Load MRTs were those with below-average correct
rate and shorter-than-average response time, and Low-Load
MRTs were those with above-average correct rate and
longer-than-average response time.
The mean response
time and correct rate of the selected MRTs was 5.70 (SD =
.90), and 52.87% (SD = 9.59) in High-Load Set, and 3.17
(SD =.55) and 77.52 % (SD = 10.33) in Low-Load Set. The
differences on response time and correct rate between these
two sets were significant, response time: F(1,
53)=158.50**, p < .001; correct rate: F(1, 53) = 83.94**, p
< .001. Two sets (High- and Low-Load) of ATs were also
prepared. The High-Load ATs were 3-digit summations and
subtractions with regrouping. The Low-Load version
included 3-digit summations and subtractions without
regrouping. During the incubation period, 5 MRTs (8
second each) and 8 ATs (10 second each) were presented.

Lexical decision times to target words among the three

A 2 (Word Type) x 3 (Condition) x 2 (Difficulty) ANOVA

using the log-transformed lexical decision time as DV, was

lexical decisions to target than neutral words. Nonsignificant effects of Condition x Time, p =.93, and
Condition x Time x Difficulty, p <.35, reveal that no

participants were in general sensitized to the answer of the
unsolved problems, but the incubation tasks did not

Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to solve either the easy
or intermediate RATs in one of the conditions. The
procedure and the presentation of the tasks in Experiment II
were identical to those used in Experiment I.

Results and Discussion
According to the unconscious-work account, participants in
the incubation conditions should perform better than
participants in other conditions, and the enhanced
performance should be accompanied by the occurrence of
unconscious processes. The meta-analysis (Sio & Ormerod,
2009) suggests that the incubation effect in the Low-Load

facilitate the spreading-activation processes to further
increase the activation level. Thus, the spreading-activation
hypothesis is not supported.

To examine how these two moderators interact, a
2(Difficulty) x 2(Cue) x 3(Condition) ANOVA with
repeated measures on Cue (No Cue vs Cue), using
improvement scores as DV, was carried out. As predicted,
there was a marginally significant Condition x Cue x
Difficulty effect, F(2, 84) = 4.00, p = .05. To further
investigate the interaction, the data were split into three
groups, in terms of the experimental conditions. In each
group, a 2 (Difficulty) x 2 (Cue) ANOVA with repeated
measures on Cue, using improvement scores as DV, was
run. A significant Cue x Difficulty effect was found in
High-Load Condition, F(1, 25) = 8.86, p=.006, revealing
that participants solving intermediate RATs benefited more
from the cues (Intermediate RAT: .16) than those solving
easy RATs (Easy RAT: -.28). This interaction effect was
not significant in Low-Load, p = .14. The low-load
incubation task did not help cue-assimilation as participants
did not benefit from the presence of cues (Easy RAT: -.22,
Intermediate RAT: .04). This pattern of results supports the
opportunistic-assimilation hypothesis, and suggests that
problem difficulty and loading of the incubation tasks are
the moderators of the cue-assimilation process. The Cue x
Difficulty effect was also not significant in the Immediate
condition, p= .82. It seems that, in both RATs, participants
benefitted from the cues in the same degree. Participants in
this condition were actively solving the problem, and thus, it
should be easy for them to assimilate the presented cues.

Although there is no evidence for the spreading-activation
hypothesis, it is interesting that there was no dissipation on
the activation of the target words even though the
participants had shifted attention to other tasks for a while.
The persistence of such activation may provide a basis for
assimilating any subsequently encountered cues (Yaniv &
Meyer, 1987).
Opportunistic Assimilation
To examine if incubation can facilitate the cue-assimilation
process, participants’ performance improvement scores in
solving the 1st, 2nd , 5th , 8th ( Cue) and the 3rd , 4th , 6th , 7th
(no Cue) RATs were compared. Table 6 presents the M and
SD of the improvement score in each condition.
Participants in the Immediate condition were, in general,
more likely to solve the unsolved RATs when relevant cues
were presented (Easy RAT: .20, Difficult RAT: .18).
However, in the Low-Load condition, the presence of cue
did not have any positive impact in solving RATs (Easy
RAT: -.22, Difficult RAT: .04). In the High-Load
Condition, only participants solving Intermediate RATs
benefited from the presence of cue (Easy RAT: -.28,
Difficult RAT: .16). It seems that the occurrence of cueassimilation depends on the problem difficulty and the
cognitive loading of incubation tasks.

General Discussion
The experiments reported here showed some incubation
effects, but only in specific task load and cueing conditions.
This outcome is consistent with the findings of Sio &
Ormerod’s (2009) meta-analysis, which showed incubation
to be highly susceptible to task-specific procedural
moderators.
The results offer little support for the spreadingactivation hypothesis. There was no evidence of increased
activation specifically as a result of an incubation period,
despite the fact that the LDT was sufficiently sensitive to
detect changes in activation of targets relative to neutral
words. The absence of spreading activation with incubation
contrasts with the finding of Sio & Rudowicz (2007) that an
incubation period sensitizes individuals to relevant memory
items. This may due to differences in cues used in these
two studies. Sio & Rudowicz found spreading activation
during the incubation period when solving RATs containing
misleading cues. It is possible that the spreading activation
occurs only when irrelevant memory items are overactivated. In the current study, the RATs were neutral, and
thus may not have fixated individuals to misleading
concepts, thereby reducing the influence of spreading
activation. It may be that, if misleading cues are provided,
then incubation effects may be found, and this possibility is
currently under test. It remains unclear whether such effects
would best be interpreted as the result of activation of

relevant knowledge or selective forgetting of irrelevant
knowledge.
In Experiment 2, the presentation of relevant solution
cues, in the form of an interpolated LDT, gave rise to
incubation effects. However the effect was limited to
solving intermediate RATs, and it occurred in the HighLoad condition but not in the Low-Load condition, even
though participants in both incubation groups were
sensitized to the answers of the unsolved problem. This
result suggests a link between incubation period and the
cue-assimilation process. Participants were sensitized to the
answer of the unsolved problem, and the activation persisted
even when they shifted the attention to other tasks. This
may provide a basis for problem solvers to pick up the
external stimuli chance encountered subsequently. However,
a cue-assimilation process is not unconditional: its
occurrence also depends on the difficulty of the problems
and loading of the incubation tasks. One possible
explanation is that a partially-activated memory trace is not
a sufficient condition for cue-assimilation. In order to
assimilate a cue to solve a problem, the problem
representation has to be activated when the cue is presented.
The high-load incubation tasks may inhibit conscious
mental activity that in turn facilitates some unconscious
problem solving processes which keeps the mental
representation of the unsolved problem activated. The
necessity of having an activated representation in cue
assimilation can also explain the findings that the positive
impact of cues was most significant in the Immediate
condition where participants solved the problem
continuously. This explanation is, however, opposite to the
meta-analysis (Sio & Ormerod, 2009) results that light low
cognitive tasks can facilitate unconscious problem solving
process. This discrepancy could be related to the incubation
condition settings in Experiment 2. In Experiment 2,
participants had 8 seconds to solve each MRT. According
to the data from Experiment 1, participants took in average
about 6 seconds to solve a difficult MRT, and 3 seconds for
the easy one. It means that participants in Experiment 2 had
more than enough time to solve the incubation tasks. Thus,
participants may not have found the High-Load tasks
sufficiently demanding, and the incubation period filled
with Low-Load task may be indeed more like a rest to them.
The High-Load condition in this study may just be
equivalent to low cognitive load conditions included in the
meta-analysis. To test this hypothesis, we are currently
conducting further research with much more demanding
incubation tasks.
In conclusion, the findings of this study support the
opportunity-assimilation hypothesis, suggesting that
incubation tasks help keep the problem representation active,
and this allow individuals to assimilate any chance
encountered cues and use them to solve the problem. This
study also shows that cognitive-loading of the incubation
task and problem difficulty are moderators of the cueassimilation process.
