Figure 1. Proportion of right- and left-hand gestures during clauses with positive and negative emotional valence. In left-
handers, left-hand gestures were more strongly associated with positive-valence clauses, whereas in right-handers right-hand
gestures were more strongly associated with positive-valence clauses, consistent with the body-specificity hypothesis.
