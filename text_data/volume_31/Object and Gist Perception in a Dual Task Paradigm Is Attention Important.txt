Experimental Design A dual task experiment with two
within-subject conditions (peripheral tasks: object
categorization and gist identification in natural scenes) was
conducted. Each participant performed 128 experimental                 a)                             b)

central task’s stimuli (a combination of 8 letters). The 8
letters were either all identical, (i.e. all L’s presented at
random orientations) or included one letter that was                                 300 ms
different from the other 7 (i.e. one T among L’s). The
letters remained onscreen for 100 ms before the peripheral
stimulus appeared. Stimuli for both tasks remained on the
screen for 180 ms. Then, the peripheral task was masked                                      100 ms
while the central stimulus remained onscreen either until the
participant entered a response or after 2000 ms. Participants
had to decide whether all letters were the same or not by

Peripheral Task In half of the trials the peripheral task was
an Object Categorization task (64 trials) and in the other
half it was a Gist Identification task. The order of the
presentation of the two blocks of trials was counterbalanced
across participants. In each trial, the stimulus was presented
100 ms after the central stimulus onset. The peripheral
stimulus remained onscreen for 180ms and it was followed
by a mask.
