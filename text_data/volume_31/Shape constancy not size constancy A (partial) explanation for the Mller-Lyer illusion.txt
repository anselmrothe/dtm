animals. I will return to these odd features at the end of the
paper.
   We have good reason to suppose that there are a number
of factors that contribute to the Müller-Lyer illusion. Hence,
instead of trying to find a monolithic explanatory scheme,
the best we can do is to single out, and explain, the most
important ones of these factors. This is exactly what I aim to
do here.
   Thus, the structure of my argument is the following. First,
I aim to point out that an essential component of the Müller-
Lyer illusion has something to do with picture perception
(just as Gregory initially claimed). Second, I give an
account of this essential component of the Müller-Lyer
illusion that is not susceptible to the objections Gregory’s
inappropriate size constancy scaling theory was susceptible
to.                                                                 Figure 1.
