   Participants entered the experiment room and sat in an
adjustable chair such that their eyes are centred 60cm (~25”)
from the screen. They were instructed to focus their gaze to
the centre of the screen and to minimize head and body
movements as much as comfortably possible. They then
underwent four practice trials to learn the task procedure,
with no feedback provided about the accuracy of their
response. Speed and accuracy were equally stressed, as was
the requirement to judge distances from the inner edge of
the stimuli. Responses were recorded on a three-button
mouse as follows (from left-button to right-): CLOSER,
SAME, and FARTHER. The spacebar was pressed to
advance between trials. Response times were recorded from
the onset of the second image to the pressing of the mouse
button.
