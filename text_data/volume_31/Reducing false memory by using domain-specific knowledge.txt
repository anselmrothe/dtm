Abstract: This paper examines the issue of false memory and its relationship to domain-specific knowledge. Forty
participants (20 experienced taxi drivers and 20 university students) were examined in a list recall experiment, using
the D/RM paradigm (Roediger & McDermott, 1995). In the experiment, participants studied lists of street names
in the metropolitan city of Hong Kong (e.g.: Nathan Road, Jordan Road, Waterloo Road)
