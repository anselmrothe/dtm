Results and Discussion
Preliminary analyses established that feature predictions did
not vary across the two stimulus sets or counterbalanced
versions of the task. All subsequent analyses were collapsed
across these factors.

reasoning were based on the assumption that people could
readily identify the target category for each item, and that
