Abstract: We examined two factors that could influence evaluation of research findings: having ones belief confirmed
or disconfirmed by evidence, and presence or absence of an explanation for the findings. Participants (n=101)
expressed a belief about a studys outcome before reading a research report. When belief was confirmed, the studys
methodology was subsequently evaluated more positively, and findings were rated as more obvious, important,
and credible. Moreover, the explanation for the finding was considered more convincing, regardless of whether
participants actually read an explanation. These participants also found it easier to think of explanations for the
finding, suggesting they may have been rating self-generated explanations. When evaluating evidence, the interaction
of prior belief and explanation was observed. Specifically, when a belief was disconfirmed, the evidence was rated
as more convincing only when an explanation was also provided. Prior belief strongly influences the process of
evaluating both research findings and explanations.
