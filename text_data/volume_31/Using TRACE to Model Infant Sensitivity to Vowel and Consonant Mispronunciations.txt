Abstract

2002) suggest that vowels play a role in phonological representation from 14 months of age. However, this result was
based on an analysis of vowel mispronunciations of only two
words. More recently, Mani and Plunkett (2007) presented
infants with vowel mispronunciations and correct pronunciations of familiar words at 15, 18 and 24 months of age. This
detailed study (10 vowel mispronunciations at 15 months of
age and 16 vowel mispronunciations at 18 and 24 months
of age) confirmed Swingley and Aslin’s findings that infants
are sensitive to vowel mispronunciations from as early as 15
months of age. In a follow-up study (Experiment 2), Mani
and Plunkett (2007) compared directly infants’ sensitivity to
vowel and consonant mispronunciations of the same familiar
words. Infants detected both types of mispronunciations and
Mani and Plunkett (2007) found no systematic differences between the two.

Very young infants possess a capacity to discriminate contrasts
that are not present in their native language. Later in development, they lose this capacity while improving the discrimination of sounds in their native language and progressively tuning their speech sensitivity to increase the phonological specificity of their lexical represenations. Recent evidence suggests
a symmetry in infant sensitivity to vowel and consonant mispronunciations of familiar words from early in the second year
of life. We investigate this question from a modelling perspective, using a continuous mapping model; TRACE. Our results
support Mani and Plunkett’s (2007) claim that both vowels and
consonants constrain lexical access to familiar words in the infant lexicon. However, TRACE predicts that infants should become increasingly sensitive to onset mispronunciations (usually consonants in English) of familiar words as vocabulary
develops, whereas their sensitivity to non-onset (often vowels)
mispronunciations should remain relatively stable during the
second year of life. Interestingly, this effect is purely driven
by the structure and size of the lexicon, as TRACE is not a
developmental model.

Introduction
Do vowels and consonants play a similar role in constraining lexical access in infant word recognition? Although it is
indisputable that both vowels and consonants are critical for
word recognition (ball vs. bell vs. tell), the relative importance of vowels and consonants in the phonological representations of early words has recently come under close scrutiny.
For example, Nazzi (2005) describes an experiment demonstrating that consonants are more discriminating than vowels in supporting lexical development at 20 months of age,
confirming the view that lexical representations rely mainly
on consonants (Nespor, Peña, & Mehler, 2003). In contrast,
Mani and Plunkett (2007) have argued for a symmetry in infants’ sensitivity to vowel and consonant mispronunciations
of familiar words at 18 and 24 months of age, suggesting that
both play a role in constraining infant word recognition.
Consonants mispronunciations have been found to influence word recognition from as early as 14 months of age
when mispronunciations involve the onset consonant (Bailey & Plunkett, 2002; Ballem & Plunkett, 2005; Swingley
& Aslin, 2000, 2002), and from 19 months of age when the
medial consonant is changed (Swingley, 2003). Vowels mispronunciations have not been studied as much as consonant
mispronunciations until recently. Swingley and Aslin (2000,

Potential explanations of the different pattern of findings
concerning the role of vowels and consonants in early lexical representations are many; the tasks are different (Mani
and Plunkett (2007) and Swingley and Aslin (2000) used an
inter-modal preferential looking task whereas Nazzi (2005)
used a name-based categorisation task), the status of lexical items differed (familiar words vs. novel words) and the
studies were conducted in different languages (English vs.
French). The current study introduces a comparison of infants’ sensitivity to vowel and consonant mispronunciations
with a widely used computational model of speech perception: TRACE (McClelland & Elman, 1986).
Spoken word recognition is an incremental process involving the elimination of competing candidates that are represented in the individual’s mental lexicon. Alternative accounts of spoken word recognition have emphasised the role
of cohort competitors (Marlsen-Wilson & Welsh, 1978) or
phonological neighbours (Cutler, 1995; Goldinger, Luce, &
Pisoni, 1989) in this competition. Attempts to adjudicate between these accounts have argued that both factors impact the
resolution of the recognition process. Allopenna, Magnuson,
and Tanenhaus (1998) have argued that the TRACE model
of speech perception (McClelland & Elman, 1986) provides
a satisfactory resolution of the relative role of cohorts and
phonological neighbours. In TRACE, a computational listener evaluates speech input against a set of lexical candidates competing for recognition. Allopenna et al. (1998)

1816

found that the time course of spoken word recognition using
eye movements can be accurately described by such continuous mapping models. Adults were instructed to move one
of four objects that were on a screen, when monitored by an
eye-tracker. Along with the referent, three competitors were
placed on screen; a cohort competitor (object starting with the
same onset and vowel), a rhyme competitor and an unrelated
competitor. Using the TRACE model, implementing a forced
choice with Luce’s choice rule (Luce, 1959) on the four objects present on screen, Allopenna et al. (1998) accurately
reproduced the typical pattern of eye-gaze of the participants.
In line with the successful comparison of TRACE with
adults’ looking behaviour described in Allopenna et al.
(1998), we investigate the impact of vowel and consonant
mispronunciations using TRACE, in an attempt to mimic the
looking behaviour of the infants studied in the two experiments of Mani and Plunkett (2007). The model eliminates the
noise of infant performance introduced by inattention, memory failure and variability of individual lexicons and permits a
precise evaluation of the impact of the phonological processes
inherent in TRACE for infant word recognition. Furthermore,
the model allows us to manipulate vocabulary size in a manner that mimics lexical development during infancy, thereby
permitting an evaluation of the potential impact of the size
and constitution of infant lexicons on their sensitivity to the
mispronunciations of familiar words. It is important to note
that since TRACE does not possess a developmental aspect,
all developmental trends emerging from the model are to be
attributed to lexical competition alone.

Recognition time for spoken words is affected not only
by the number of phonological neighbours (Cutler, 1995),
but also by their frequency (Goldinger et al., 1989). Therefore, we identified individual token frequencies, by extracting
word frequencies based on the Manchester corpora (Theakston, Lieven, Pine, & Rowland, 2001) from the CHILDES
(MacWhinney, 1991) database, where 12 English children
were recorded weekly from 20 to 36 months of age.
Given the large size of the infant lexicon at 24 months of
age, many of the phonemes needed to represent the different words were not encoded in the original TRACE model
(McClelland & Elman, 1986) nor in its re-implementation
(Strauss et al., 2007). Therefore, we added feature values
for all phonemes used in the infant’s lexicon.1 Table 1 reproTable 1: Phoneme feature values used in the simulation; Pow=Power, Voc=Vocalic, Diff=Diffuse, Acu=Acute,
Cons=Consonantal and Voi=Voiced

Experiment 1
The first experiment attempts to simulate Mani and Plunkett’s
(2007) finding that infants are sensitive to vowels mispronunciations in familiar words from 15 months of age. Mani and
Plunkett (2007) used an inter-modal preferential looking task
(Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, Cauley, & Gordon, 1987) in which
target and distracter objects are presented side-by-side on a
projection screen while the target object was named over a
loudspeaker using either a correct pronunciation or a mispronunciation. Preference for the target object was used an index of the infants appreciation of an association between the
heard label and the visual object.

Method
We used jTRACE (Strauss, Harris, & Magnuson, 2007), a reimplementation of the TRACE model (McClelland & Elman,
1986) in order to simulate Experiment 1 of Mani and Plunkett
(2007). We compiled typical lexicons for 15-, 18- and 24month-year-olds from the British CDI (Hamilton, Plunkett, &
Schafer, 2000) (a British adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates
CDI, Fenson et al., 1993) using words that are understood by
more than 50% of the infants in each age group. The lexicons
are specified using data from 50 infants at 15 months of age,
179 infants at 18 months of age and 81 infants at 24 months
of age and include 56, 183 and 354 words, respectively.

duces the feature value of all phonemes used in the simulations. Long vowels such as u:, i:, @:, O:, E: are implemented as
being twice as long as their respective short counterparts u, i,
@, O, E, while keeping the same feature values. All words in
the lexicon were encoded using the IPA phonemes listed in
Table 1, using British English pronunciation. Vowel and consonant mispronunciations were encoded using their phonetic
description reported in Mani and Plunkett (2007).
Correctly pronounced words and mispronounced words are
presented to the model and activation levels of two competitors (the target and a distracter) are monitored. We adopt the

same linking hypothesis as Allopenna et al. (1998), in order
to map the activation levels to fixation probabilities. We assume that fixation probability to the image i is a direct function of the probability that its associated label is the target,
given the pronounced word. Moreover, the probability that
image i is the target is determined by comparison of the activation levels of the labels associated with the other potential
targets. Following Allopenna et al. (1998), activation levels (a) are then transformed into response strengths following
Luce (1959). Given the high salience of the images, we assume that total looking time is split entirely between the target and distractor objects, enabling us to convert the response
strengths into response probabilities using the Luce choice
rule. The probability of looking to the target becomes:
ekatarget
(1)
ptarget = ka
e target + ekadistractor
where k is a free parameter determining the amount of separation between units of different activations (value set to k = 2).
All other parameters used in jTRACE were set to their default values. Proportion of looking times to the target and
distracters are reported as the average over 100 processing
cycles starting with the onset of the pronounced word. No
attempt was made to match the actual time course of the infants’ looking behaviour.
Table 2 presents the stimuli used in Experiment 1 by Mani
and Plunkett (2007) and in the current simulation. The stimuli used for 15 months old were slightly different in order
to accommodate to their smaller vocabularies but maintained
the same constraint that targets and distracters had the same
onsets.

Results
Table 3 displays the proportion of looking times at the target
produced by the model. The model’s response probabilities

match the pattern of infant looking preferences; target preferences are greater when the referent is correctly pronounced
than when the medial vowel is changed (15 months of age;
p < 4 · 10−4 : 18 months of age; p < 10−5 : 24 months of age;
p < 10−4 ), indicating that vowel identity plays a contributing role in constraining auditory word recognition in jTRACE
when using lexicons representative of 15–24 month old infants. A naming effect is significant in both conditions across
all age groups; the model predicts looking times to the target
greater than chance, indicating that the referent is recognised
despite the mispronunciation (all p’s < 3 · 10−4 ). No age effect was found.

Experiment 2
In a second simulation, we aim to clarify the relative importance of vowel and consonant mispronunciations in familiar words, by modelling the second experiment of Mani and
Plunkett (2007). In this study, we compare looking times to
the target when it is pronounced correctly, when the medial
vowel is changed and when the onset consonant is changed.
Method Table 4 presents the stimuli used in Experiment 2,
matching those used in the second experiment in Mani and
Plunkett (2007). Whereas all stimuli belong to the typical lexicons of 18 and 24 month old infants, bib, bike, boot, bus, coat
and keys were added to the 15 month old jTRACE lexicon,
even though they are only known, according to the British
CDI (Hamilton et al., 2000), by less than 50% of the infants
at that age.

Results
Table 5 reports the proportion of time looking to the target in
the different conditions; when the referent is correctly named,
when the medial vowel is changed and when the onset consonant is changed. For all age groups, looking times at the
target were longer for correct pronunciations compared to
mispronunciations, verifying the contributing role of vowels and consonants in constraining auditory word recognition in jTRACE when using representative infant lexicons.
Target preference is greater for correct pronunciations than
for vowel mispronunciations (15 months of age; t = −3.5483,
p = 0.0032: 18 months of age; t = −4.5182, p < 5 · 10−4 : 24
months of age; t = −5.4029, p < 10−4 ). Similarly, simulated
looking times are longer for correct pronunciations than consonant mispronunciations (15 months of age; t = −2.8149,

0.0022: 18 months of age; p = 0.0026: 24 months of age;
p = 0.0032) and for consonant mispronunciations (15 months
of age; p < 10−5 : 18 months of age; p < 10−4 : 24 months
of age; p < 6 · 10−4 ). Mispronunciation naming effects were
not found in Mani and Plunkett (2007). However, Swingley
and Aslin (2000) report a mispronunciation naming effect for
infants between 18 and 23 months of age (73% of looking
times at target for correctly pronounced labels and 61.3% for
mispronunciations). Figure 1 provides a graphical comparison of Swingley and Aslin’s (2000) data to the simulation results. The mispronunciations reported in Swingley and Aslin
(2000) correspond to the aggregation of four consonant mispronunciations and two vowel mispronunciations. The close

A comparison of target preferences between vowel and
consonant mispronunciations did not reveal any statistical differences (15 months of age; t = −1.9126, p = 0.0765: 18
months of age; t = −1.4414, p = 0.1715: 24 months of age;
t = −0.294, p = 0.773). These simulation results confirm
Mani and Plunkett’s (2007) claim that there is a symmetry in
infants’ sensitivity to vowel and consonant mispronunciations
as early as 15 months of age.
Closer examination of the results suggests an asymmetry
between the sensitivity to vowel and consonant mispronunciations may be present for younger age groups. An age effect analysis (multiple comparison procedure) revealed no effect for correct pronunciations (F = 0.0057, p = 0.9944), nor
for vowels (F = 0.3388, p = 0.7165). However, the analysis revealed a robust effect for consonants mispronunciations (F = 5.6443, p = 0.0109). Note that, in the model, the
only factor that varies with age is the size of the lexicon itself. This finding predicts that infants should become increasingly sensitive to consonants mispronunciations as their lexicon grows in size. No such change in sensitivity is predicted
for vowel mispronunciations over the lexicon range explored
in this model.
We also performed a statistical analysis in order to determine whether an effect of naming was observed for mispronunciations as well as correct pronunciations. For all age
groups, target looking was significantly greater than chance

of the TRACE simulations with Swingley et al.’s (2000) data
for 18 to 23 month-year olds where all mispronunciations are
aggregated into the grey bar.
agreement between the simulation results and experimental
data suggest that, like the infants, jTRACE can identify the
target referent in a forced choice task when the target is mispronounced. jTRACE succeeds over a broad range of mispronunciation types and vocabulary sizes when the name of
the distracter has the same consonant onset as the target. It
should be noted that this constraint did not hold in the Swingley and Aslin (2000) study where targets and distracters had
different onsets.

Discussion
We have investigated the impact of vowel and consonant mispronunciations on lexical access to familiar words in infancy
from a modelling perspective. A comparison of simulation
results to experimental data suggests that the TRACE model,
when supplemented with the Luce choice rule, appropriately
captures infants’ looking preferences in a forced choice in-

1819

terpretation of the intermodal preferential looking task. The
model, as with the infants, showed greater target looking
when the target is correctly pronounced than when it is mispronounced. Looking times at the target in the model did not
differ significantly when the mispronunciation involved an
onset consonant change and when it involved a medial vowel
change for all age conditions, thereby mimicking the symmetry in infants’ sensitivities to vowel and consonant mispronunciations in familiar words present from an early age
(Mani & Plunkett, 2007). However, the simulations predict
that infant sensitivity to vowel and consonant mispronunciations exhibit different development trajectories; while age has
no impact on target preferences for correct pronunciations
and vowel mispronunciations, a robust age effect is found
for consonant mispronunciations. Furthermore, the simulation results suggest that, despite a sensitivity to mispronunciations, looking times at target exceeded chance, indicating
the presence of a naming effect as reported by Swingley and
Aslin (2000) (also reported by Bailey and Plunkett (2002) and
Ballem and Plunkett (2005)). This set of results has important
implications for theories of lexical competition in infancy that
we discuss below.

Table 6: Number of cohort competitors for different onset
consonants used in Experiment 2, at 15, 18 and 24 months of
age.

In the continuous mapping model used, TRACE, competition occurs at the levels of phonemes and words. The model
contains no semantic associations nor semantic representations of any kind. As a consequence, the patterns of findings observed in Mani and Plunkett (2007) can be explained,
computationally in terms of phonological competition alone.
In that account, upon hearing a word, its phonological content is compared to the phonological content associated with
both pictures presented to the infant; the target and the distracter. Words in their lexicons compete at the level of their
phonological overlap. Although semantic information may
be accessed shortly after hearing the word, as suggested by
Swingley and Fernald (2002), no semantic content is required
in order to explain the effects of vowel and consonant mispronunciations and the naming effect observed in infants.
Different age groups are modelled by coding their typical lexicons. Word frequencies, phonological features and all
other parameters are kept constant across lexicons Therefore,
age effects in the model are driven solely by the different set
of competitors (the infant’s lexicon) at 15, 18 and 24 months
of age. As the size of the lexicon increases, the set of competitors increases, thereby impacting directly the set of cohort
competitors. Note that for these relatively small lexicons the
probability that a lexical entry has a phonological neighbour
remains quite small. Potential lexical candidates in TRACE
are activated as the input unfolds over time. Thus, the initial
portion of the word is important for activating potential lexical candidates as proposed by the cohort account (MarlsenWilson & Welsh, 1978). Table 6 displays the number of cohort competitors for different onset consonants used in Experiment 2, in the typical lexicon at 15, 18 and 24 months of
age. The number of potential lexical competitors increases
dramatically in this age range. For example, the number of t-

onset words increases by a factor 4 in the three month period
from 15 to 18 months, p-onset words increases by a factor 20
between 15 and 24 months and the first g-onset words appear
first at 18 months. In the model, the dramatic increase in the
number of words around the time of the vocabulary spurt impacts directly the phonological sensitivity to onset consonant
mispronunciations, even in the absence of any change in the
semantic representations of words in the developing lexicon.
In contrast, sensitivity to vowel mispronunciations seems
to be unchanged by the size of the lexicon, over the age
range considered. TRACE fails to identify an exact referent for the mispronounced word and compares both words
associated with the target and distractor to the input word, in
terms of overall phonological overlap. The size of the lexicon and the number of competitors have no direct impact on
the head-to-head comparison of the target and distractor. Furthermore, once the main effect of cohort competition is eliminated, only subtle effects of neighbourhood activation can
be distinguished. The forced choice procedure, implemented
through the Luce rule in the model, enhances the match of the
phonologically neighbouring vowel mispronunciation to the
target. Hence, vowel mispronunciation effects are relatively
insensitive to changes in vocabulary size.
In summary, the sensitivity to onset consonant mispronunciations is directly influenced by the number of cohort competitors, a by-product of the increasing size of the lexicon.
The sensitivity to medial vowel mispronunciations is, in contrast, a subtle effect of the co-activation of neighbourhood
words enhanced by the forced choice procedure. In this respect, we suggest that the presence of a sensitivity to nononset changes need not be attributed to the fact that it is a
vowel change. Any change to non-onset phonemes should
have a similar impact. This prediction is supported by findings that infants are also sensitive to medial consonant mispronunciations (Swingley, 2003). As discussed above, the
number of cohort competitors directly impact the sensitivity
to onset mispronunciations. A language with a substantial incidence of onset vowel words should display a strong sensitivity to onset vowel mispronunciations which increases with
age.
The implementation of TRACE for studying phonological
sensitivities and lexical competition can easily be extended

1820

to the study of speech sensitivities in different languages and
at different ages. Moreover, the implementation of the Luce
rule allows for a direct comparison to infants’ looking preferences in a visual world task. In the present study, we have
shown that infant sensitivity to word mispronunciations, as
indexed by preferential looking, can be explained purely in
terms of phonological competition. The conditions of competition implemented in the model were quite severe insofar as
the labels for the target and distracter objects always had the
same onset consonants. Investigation of the effects of relaxing this constraint would enable a more direct comparison to
other experiments investigating infant mispronunciation sensitivities (Swingley & Aslin, 2000, 2002; Bailey & Plunkett,
2002; Ballem & Plunkett, 2005).
The simplifying assumptions adopted in the current implementation also maintained word token frequencies across age
conditions. The model would also allow an evaluation of the
impact of token frequency on mispronunciation sensitivity,
and the model’s sensitivity to mispronunciations of recently
acquired words and/or minimal pairs. A comparison of vowel
and consonant mispronunciations of recently acquired words
that form minimal pairs would permit a computational investigation of Nazzi’s (2005) claim that consonants are more
salient for lexical acquisition than vowels.
