We added this factor to address two potential problems:
First, differential fixation proportions on the depicted events
corresponding to the global and the local event might
simply reflect the quality of the match between the visual
properties of the depicted events and the two adverbs. If the
additions of gerade (just) alters or even destroys the effect,
this possibility can be ruled out. Secondly, a similar logic                    Figure 1: A visual stimulus with three depicted

Hypotheses
If locally coherent sequences are mentally processed and
interpreted, fixation proportions should be higher on the
local event in (1), where sentences actually contain a local
coherence, than in (2), where they don’t. This difference
was expected to show up shortly after the participle/adverb,
which is required for the LSC interpretation.
   In (3-4), where the subject-NP was additionally separated
from the adverb by an inserted temporal adverb, we
expected to see fewer fixations on the local event at, or
shortly after, the ambiguous adverb, as a potential locally
coherent event schema still lacks an actor (Gerade
überrascht …). So if local coherence interpretation can be
established between (3) and (4), we expected to see the
effect only later in the sentence.
