essential properties: completeness and transitivity.
   The formal property of completeness (for weak

                                                                            I1= α        I2=β       I3= γ    I4=δ      Im
   - the relation ≥ is complete if and only if for any
element A and B of its domain, either A ≥ B, or B≥A.                        i1           i2         i3       i2        ik

This property guarantees that an agent is able to compare                   i3           i3         i3       i1        …
between two options. The formal property of transitivity                    in           in         in       in        in
