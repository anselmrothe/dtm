Abstract

and human development. Many studies have also
demonstrated that gaze direction – used as a spatial cue reflexively triggers attentional shift (for a review, see
Frischen, Bayliss & Tipper, 2007). These studies have
applied a spatial cueing paradigm, first introduced by Posner
(1980) and reviewed by Friesen and Kingstone (1998). In
their experiments, a central unpredictive gaze was used as a
cue to orient attention to both left or right. A target appeared
in either the direction in which the gaze was directed, or in
another location. Participants were typically faster to detect
or identify the target when it appeared in the direction
signalled by the gaze, as compared to when it is presented in
other locations (‘gaze effect’). This effect occurs even when
the gaze direction is not predictive of the subsequent target
location and observers are instructed to ignore the gaze
direction (see, e.g., Friesen and Kingstone, 1998), and even
when they are told to expect targets at the opposite location
(see, e.g., Driver et al., 1999). On the basis of these findings,
some researchers have proposed that automatic orienting to
eye gaze may represent an unique attentional process and
reflect the operation of a specialized cognitive mechanism
(e.g., Langton and Bruce 1999). However, when arrows are
used as cues, normal subjects behave more or less in the
same manner as to gaze (Tipples, 2002): faster reaction
times are observed when targets appear congruent to the
arrow direction, and slower when incongruent (‘arrow
effect’). Therefore, the arrow represents a relevant
instrument to evaluate the socio-biological importance of a
gaze-cue, because it has a directional property just like gaze,
but no biological significance.

This study aimed to evaluate whether the magnitude of
attentional cueing can be modulated by the context in which
the target appears. Both an arrow or a directional eye-gaze
were used as non-informative cues. Targets, i.e. red patches –
were presented over faces or boxes, that rapresented the
peripheral placeholders. A larger cueing effect was found
when targets appeared on faces rather than on standard
placeholder boxes. This effect was found only when a
directional eye-gaze was used as non-informative cue; arrow
cues did not show effects. These results suggest that gaze
properties could have a social special status in orienting
attention.

Introduction
Both processing and expression of human gaze are essential
in making a person as the unique social being that is, since
the motor intention of others can be inferred from their gaze
(e.g., Baron-Cohen, Weelwright, & Jolliffe, 1997). We are
sensitive to where another individual is looking and their
gaze give us a good idea of their focus of interest, inducing
to orient our attention to the same location (e.g., Driver,
Davis, Ricciardelli, Kidd, Maxwell & Baron-Cohen, 1999).
This behaviour is known as ‘joint attention’ and has been
posited as vital in interpersonal interactions (Emery, 2000;
Moore & Dunham, 1995). This behaviour is of interest not
only for researchers investigating the mechanisms of visual
attention, but also for those investigating social cognition

In order to test whether gaze cues have a special social
status in orienting attention, in this study we manipulated
the social relevance of the target context. In most gazecueing studies the target appears on a placeholder box or on
a blank screen. However, in more naturalistic situations
persons orient attention to a particular event, object or
person in the scene. To establish a representation of
another’s attentional state, we must be able to orient not
only in the general direction of observed gaze, but to the
correct object of attention (Emery, 2000; Emery, Lorincz,
Perrett, Oram & Baker, 1997). So far only the study of
Bayliss and Tipper (2005) has evaluated the role of the
target context on the magnitude of attentional cueing, via
the observation of non-informative directional arrows or
eye-gaze. In this study, a target was displayed on faces in
half of the trials, whereas during the other half of the trials
the same target appeared on scrambled faces. When targets
appeared on faces, cueing effects were larger compared to
those showed when the same target appeared on scrambled
faces. This effect was found for both gaze-cues and arrowcues, suggesting that cue properties had little effects on
cueing magnitude. However, one interpretation of these data
could be that differences on cueing magnitude as a function
of target placeholders (faces or scrambled faces) do not
reflect differences between social and non-social contexts;
rather they would only reflect differences between coherent
meaningful and incoherent meaningless context. Based on
this hypothesis, there are no reasons to expect that the type
of used cue (gaze or arrow) is different in operation as a
funtion of the target context, thus resulting in different
effects.
Therefore, in order to make evident differences in the
cueing effects, induced by eye-gazes and arrows, in this
experiment we manipulated the social relevance of the
context in which the target appear (on a face or on a
standard placeholder box). The predictions were
straightforward: if the gaze activates a social orienting
mechanism, then it should induce a larger attentional shift
when the target appears on faces than when the target
appears on a standard placeholder box. Such social
mechanisms are not predicted to be so strongly active when
the spatial cue is an arrow; this type of cue should not
induce different cueing effect as a function of the context
conditions (faces or boxes). Moreover, differences in cueing
magnitude as a function of target placeholders were directly
probed: in each trial both face and box placeholders were
presented in the display. Thus, the different patterns of
results obtained as a function of the target context are not
expected to arise from differences in participant strategies,
but rather from the type context per se.

All of the participants had normal or corrected-to-normal
vision, and were unaware of the purpose of the experiments.

Apparatus
Stimuli were presented on a 21-inch color VGA monitor.
An IBM-compatible PC running E-Prime software
controlled the presentation of the stimuli, timing operations,
and data collection. Responses were gathered with a
standard keyboard.

Stimuli
Stimuli and trial sequences are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.
The placeholder set consisted of two schematic faces and
two boxes. The placeholder faces have a straight-ahead
gaze. The dimensions of the placeholders (both faces and
boxes) were 2 x 2.5 cm. In Experiment 1A a central face
with the pupils directed either to the left or to the right was
used as gaze-cue. In Experiment 1B a directional arrow was
used as cue. Targets were presented as red patches over the
faces, or over the boxes. The area that the target covered
was matched to the size of the faces.

Procedure
Participants were seated at the distance of 56 cm in front of
a computer monitor, in a dimly lit, sound-attenuated room,
and their heads were held steady with a chin/head rest. Each
trial began with a display consisting of a central fixation
stimulus and four peripheral placeholder targets (one face
and one box for each side of the screen ).
The fixation stimuli differed depending on the cue types.
With gaze cueing (Experiment 1A) the fixation stimulus
was a central face with the pupils centered vertically in the
eyes. With arrow cueing (Experiment 1B) the fixation
stimulus was a horizontal line centered on the screen. This
display was presented for 700 ms. The cue appearance
resulted from the movement of the eyes, or the appearance
of arrow-heads. These cues were not predictive of target
location. The target would then appear on one of the
peripheral placeholders, after 150, 300 or 600 ms. This
display remained until response, or until 1500 ms had
elapsed. A blank screen was then presented for 700 ms after
each trial. Participants were instructed to respond to the
presentation of a target by pressing the spacebar as soon as
they detected the onset of the red patch. They were also
informed that the direction of the central cue did not predict
target location, and that they should ignore it, while
maintaining central fixation throughout each trial.
Participants completed a practice block of 25 trials,
followed by an experimental block of 104 trials. Cue
direction, target location, placeholder position, and
cue–target stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) were selected
randomly and equally. Eight catch trials, in which no target
was presented, occurred randomly in each block.

METHOD
Participants
Eighteen students (mean age of 24 ± 3 years) signed an
informed consent form before participating as volunteers in
the study. The local ethical committee approved the study.

Results
Experiment 1A: Gaze Cueing
The mean RTs are shown in Table 1. A SOA (150, 300 and
600ms) x VALIDITY (valid vs. invalid) x CONTEXT
(Faces vs. Boxes) repeated measures ANOVA revealed that
RTs on valid trials (Mean= 318 ms) were significantly faster
than RTs on invalid trials (Mean=330 ms; F1,17=11.52; p<
.004). In addition, the mean RTs decreased with SOA
(F2,24=25.06; p< .00001). The main effect of CONTEXT
was significant (F1,17=14.33; p< .002): RTs were slower
when the target appeared on faces (Mean=330 ms) than
when the target appeared on a standard placeholder box
(Mean=319ms). More importantly, the interaction
VALIDITY x CONTEXT was significant (F1,17=5,10;
p<.04; figure 3). A post-hoc analysis revealed a facilitation
effect when the target appeared on faces (p<.0004), whereas
no differences were registered between cued and uncued
trials when the target appeared on boxes (p<1). The
interactions SOA x VALIDITY (F<1), SOA x CONTEXT
(F<1) and SOA x VALIDITY x CONTEXT (F<1) were not
significant.

Design
Each experiment had a three-factor repeated measure
design. Validity had two levels: valid trials (direction of the
cue was congruent with target location) and invalid trials
(direction of the cue was incongruent with target location).
SOA had three levels: 150, 300, 600 ms. Context had two
levels: Faces and Boxes. Duncan tests were used for the
post-hoc analysis of the means. The order of cueing
paradigms (gaze / arrow) was counterbalanced across
participants.

1999; Friesen & Kingstone, 1998)1, and non-predictive
arrow cues (Hommel, Pratt, Colzato & Godijn, 2001;
Tipples, 2002). When eye-gaze was used as a cue, it
induced larger cueing effects when targets appeared on
faces than when targets were presentd on standard
placeholder boxes. This effect was not found for noninformative arrow cues. These results confirm our
hypothesis according to which any modulation of cueing
towards faces or placeholder boxes would only be evident
when the cue is a directional gaze, produced by a face.
In addition, the present results seems to suggest that
observing a social interaction between cue and target, when
both are faces, results in larger cueing effects (20ms),
compared to the condition showing an arrow pointing to a
face (10ms). In conclusion, when eye-gazes and arrows
were used as spatial cues they induced different effects on
attentional orienting. The origin of these differences could
reside in dissimilar encoding and function required by eyegazes and arrows.

Experiment 1B: Arrow Cueing
The mean RTs are shown in table 2. A SOA (150, 300 and
600ms) x VALIDITY (valid vs. invalid) x CONTEXT
(Faces vs. Boxes) repeated measures ANOVA revealed that
RTs on valid trials (Mean=326 ms) were significantly faster
than RTs on invalid trials (Mean=336 ms; F1,17=6.17;
p<.03). The main effect of CONTEXT was significant
(F1,17=8.79; p<.009): RTs were slower when the target
appeared on faces (Mean=335 ms) than when the target
appear on a standard placeholder box (Mean= 327ms). In
addition, the mean RTs decreased with SOA (F2,24=14.04;
p<.00001). More importantly, the interaction VALIDITY x
CONTEXT was not significant (F1,17<1; figure 4). No other
interaction was significant (Fs< 1).

Discussion
Results showed that the magnitude of orienting induced by
non-informative directional eye-gaze could be modulated by
the context in which the target appear. Consistent cueing
effects were found in all conditions, replicating several
studies, with non-predictive gaze cues (e.g. Driver et al.,

In experiment 1A, the facilitation effect did not revert to an
IOR effect even at the 600 ms SOA. With gaze cues reliable
inhibition effects were observed only at a very long SOA of
2400 ms (Frischen & Tipper; 2004; Frischen, Smilek, Eastwood
