   Figure 1. Replication of Köhler‟s (1929) demonstration of
   the proximity principle (a), the Voronoi tessellation of a
    random point set (b), and the corresponding Delaunay
           triangulation of the random point set (c).
Examples of these sub-graphs are given in Figure 2. As can
be seen, the graphs are hierarchically nested: the nearest
neighbors are a subset of the minimum spanning tree, which
is a subset of the relative neighborhood graph, and so on, up
to the Delaunay triangulation.
   Each of these measures has previously been considered in
research on structure detection. For example, Zahn (1971)
demonstrated that the minimum spanning tree could be used
to detect the presence of separate clusters of dots and
changes in dot density in random dot textures. Similar
demonstrations have also been made by Toussaint (1980)
using the relative neighborhood graph, minimum spanning
trees and Delaunay triangulation, and by Ahuja and
Tuceryan (1989) using Delaunay triangulation. In each of
these papers it was demonstrated that algorithms based on
the respective relational measures were able to detect the
presence of what Toussaint described as “perceptually
meaningful” structure.
   It is important to note that these relational structures are
not merely a convenient geometric measure more suited to
computer/artificial vision than human vision. Rather, there               Figure 2. Set of randomly distributed points with its

the perception of structure in constellation-like stimuli is
largely invariant across individuals.

analogous to precision/recall analyses in information
retrieval research, Figure 4 shows the proportional overlap
between the empirical links in the graph structures (y-axis),
and the graph links in the empirical structures (x-axis).
   For the Delaunay triangulation links the data indicate high
recall and low precision: a high proportion of the empirical
links are Delaunay triangulation links ( X = 98%), but the
Delaunay structures also contain a high proportion of links
that are not present in the empirical structures ( X = 58%).
Conversely, Figure 4 indicates that nearly all of the nearest
neighbor links are present in the empirical structures ( X =
93%), but the empirical structures also contain numerous
links that are not nearest neighbors ( X = 53%).
   Figure 4 suggests that the empirical structures are best
described by relative neighborhood graph or minimum
spanning tree links, with a close correspondence between
the proportion of graph links that are empirical links ( X =
83% and 86% for RNG and MST respectively) and
empirical links that are graph links ( X = 84% and 82% for
