Abstract
Maybe one of the most profound methodological problems
in modern linguistics is the lack of instruments for modeling
language as a dynamic, variable system. Language looks in
classic linguistic paradigms a static structure without the
ability to evolution. In this paper author outlines the
«quantum» approach to language. The quantum theory
paradigm is one of the most important methodological
results of 20th century and it gives an opportunity for the
dynamic view on language. The author applies this
paradigm to the sentence denotation structure analysis.
There are two basic findings from the present study. First,
the sentence denotation structure isn’t homogeneous, some
its elements are more important for humans than others.
This statement conforms to the E. Rosch’s investigations of
human categorization, but, unlike Rosch’s assertions, the
structure changes when event context becomes different.
Second, the sentence denotation structure isn’t an external
in respect of a person characteristic, but this is the result of a
person, language and the external world interaction. The
most frequent and consequently the most probable
interactions cause its base elements. This affirmation fits the
quantum theory paradigm.

Introduction
If we look at the methodological development of
modern linguistics, we can observe two main
methodological paradigm.
In spite of serious differences between them, the
fundamental linguistic theories which appeared at the
second half of the 20th Century (Chomsky’s
Transformational-Generative Grammar theory in all
its forms, NSM-theory of Wierzbicka and Goggard,
the model «Sense-Text» of Mel’čuk, Apresjan and
Zholkovsky etc. (Wierzbicka, 1972; Wierzbicka,
1980; Wierzbicka, 1996; Mel’čuk, 1995; Mel’čuk,
1996; Sgal et al., 1986; Jaszczolt, 2002)) consider
language as a formal structure beyond man as a sociocultural entity. These theories use the approaches in
logic and analytical philosophy which are based on
the investigations of formal languages. A natural
language is interpreted as an imperfect formal
language by them and a lot of their base concepts and
statements look taken from logic (Dummett, 1991,
p.22). In whole, these researches are connected with
the tradition of Western rationalism of the 17-18th
centuries and, finally, with Plato’s and Aristotle’s
ideas (Glebkin, 2007, p.12-22; Glebkin, 2007a). The
main weak point of this approach is the view on
language as a static structure without the ability to
evolution. A formal language exists beyond time, but
the meaning of ordinary words and sentences changes
in time and this change is their essential feature, not a
defect.

1483

The other approach developing at 80-90’s of the
last century includes a person in the structure of a
language theory, but this person isn’t a socio-cultural
entity, they haven’t variable socio-cultural features.
The main features of this person are as universal as
the features of Kant’s transcendental subject. The
obvious example of this approach is the theory of
cognitive metaphors based on common for human
beings body experience (Lacoff 1987, Johnson 1987).
Moving in this direction we also haven’t any
opportunity for the dynamic view on language.
It is Aristotle, who became one of the first
philosophers outlining the dynamic system paradigm.
This paradigm is founded on the notion of possibility.
In this case changes are described as the passage from
possibility to actuality. In 20th century science this
paradigm turns into the exact theory. I mean quantum
mechanics.
The base postulates of quantum theory are as
follows:
a) From the viewpoint of classical theory any
physical value is the attribute of an external object
and it can be measured absolutely exactly (the result
doesn’t depend on the measuring procedure); from the
viewpoint of quantum theory the physical quantity
value is the result of the interaction between the
object and the measuring instrument and this value is
the property of the interaction process, not the object.
b) It is impossible in quantum theory to say
anything about the object’s state beyond the process
of measuring. One can only say about possibility of
an object to be found in some state after the
interaction with the device. It is the concept of
probability which becomes the quantitative
characteristic of this possibility.
c) Classical values become in quantum
mechanics only the most probable values of quantum
variables. The results of quantum theory passes into
the results of classical physics, when the dimensions
of the object are large and the most probable value
becomes the only possible.
The methodological paradigm, which underlies
these postulates, was also formulated in social science
in Max Weber’s model of «ideal types» (Weber,
1904). Later it became the base of different theories
in diverse areas of knowledge. The most important
application of this paradigm to cognitive science is
James Gibson’s ecological approach to cognition
(Gibson, 1979). However, quantum mechanics is
remaining the most profound and experimentally
grounded realization of this paradigm.
In this paper I am showing that the quantum
paradigm can be used as the third paradigm in

linguistics, which opens a path for creating a dynamic
model of language 1 .
Further I am applying this paradigm to the
problem of sentence meaning. One can mark out two
main views on this problem, which take place in
modern linguistics. The most of researchers suppose
that “to know the meaning of the sentence is to know
under what conditions this sentence would be true”
(Jaszczolt, 2002, p.53). This view is connected with
works of Frege, but writing «Bedeutung» he meant
«Wahrheitswert», i.e. «truth» or «false» (Frege, 2002,
p.30). Later Tarsky and Davidson change meaning of
«meaning», approaching it to Frege’s «Sinn» but they
keep his view on the sentence meaning 2 . In these
limits we can meet analytic interpretations reducing
the meaning of whole to meanings of its elements and
their relationships (Tarsky) or holistic ones, which
interpret it as some kind of theorem. This theorem is
proved by using a finite quantity of axioms, which are
general for language. In this case meanings of words
derive from the sentence meaning (Davidson). The
common trait of both attitudes is the interpretation of
the sentence meaning as an attribute of language as
external for person reality. You can know the
meaning or not know, but you can’t change it. This is
beyond your competence (Hoffman, 1995; Patterson
2005) .
The second view is connected with the
interpretation of sentence meaning as a consequence
of the speech act. «The meaning sentence is all that
the hearer need know about the language in order to
interpret the utterance» (Alston, 2000, p.149).
I haven’t any opportunity to discuss here these
views in detail. However I must note that it’s
impossible to describe the changing of the sentence
meaning in their scope.
Moving to description of quantum approach to
the problem of sentence meaning, I would like to
specify the limits of further discussion. The main
purpose of this paper is to raise problem of meaning
formation of simple sentences, what contains basis
level concepts. Classical theories of sentence meaning
assert that all instances that satisfy these conditions
represent the denotation equally. However, it was
displayed in E. Rosch’s classical experiments with
natural language concepts, that the structure of the
concept wasn’t homogeneous and some objects were
clearly better exemplars of the concept than others
(Rosch, 1975; Rosch, 1978). The hypothesis of my
study was that the structure of the sentence denotation
also isn’t homogeneous and this structure depends on
1

A few attempts has been done in applying quantum theory
to creating some models in the field of cognitive linguistics
over last three years (e.g., Aerts et al., 2006; Gabora 2008).
However, these models are based on consequences of the
main postulates of quantum theory and not connected to the
postulates themselves directly. Therefore the analogies that
the models draw are derivative and they don’t reveal the
grounds of the similarity of described processes.

We aren’t discussing here differences, which occur in the
intuinitionistic or in the falsificationstic theory of meaning,
because they change nothing in our discussion. About these
differences see: Dummett, 1976

not only respondents, but also on the context of the
investigation.

Study
In the research was used well-known free associations
method.

Method
Participants. A total of 186 native Russian speakers
(25 - 7-8-year-old, 133 - 15-17-year-old, 28 - 18-yearold and older; children and teenagers are pupils of
Moscow schools; adults are teachers and engineers); a
total of 42 native speakers of French (18-29-year-old,
students of Université Toulouse II-Le Mirail).
Procedure. The researcher pronounced the phrase
Chelovek idet po doroge (A person is walking
along/down the road) for Russian participants and the
phrase Une personne va le long du chemin for French
participants and asked them to describe in detail (by
the words) the picture, which appeared in their
consciousness, when they heard this phrase. They had
to describe (if they recognized it) a person (gender,
age, how he looks), a road (highway, street in a city,
country road, path in the forest etc.), a landscape
around, a weather, time of day, season etc. In Russia
the investigation was conducted in different places
and in different seasons (in summer in the country
(Ferapontovo, Vologodskaya district) and in autumn
and winter in Moscow), in France – in winter in
Toulouse.

Results and Discussion
The results of the study confirm the base hypothesis.
The structure of the denotation of the analyzable
sentence isn’t homogeneous. There are the best
patterns of a person (a young or middle-aged man for
Russian (57% reports 3 ); a young or middle-aged man
(40%) and a young women (21%) for French
participants), of a road and the landscape around (a
country road among the fields (39%) for Russian; the
same image (36%) and a path in the forest (24%) for
French participants), of a season (summer (including
the end of spring and the beginning of autumn) (51%)
for Russian; spring (31%) and autumn (31%) for
French participants) and of time of day (afternoon 48% for Russian and French participants).
Some of these results are defined by the structure
of language and easily explained by the classical
semantics. For instance, chelovek (a person) is the
masculine gender word and the most of respondents
described a man, not a women. Although there isn’t
articles in Russian, chelovek in this sentence is the
same as a person, not the person. It correlates with
the fact that many participants didn’t describe a
person’s appearance and some of them wrote that they
saw the person from behind. In Russian there are the
separate words for a highway (shosse), for a street in
3

25 reports of children aren’t taken into account in this
count.

the city (ulica), for a path in the forest (tropinka), but
there isn’t a separate word for a country road. One can
therefore expect that a country road will be more
frequent image of doroga (road) than others.
However, some results aren’t described by the
classical paradigm. In order to make this clear we will
select three pairs of subgroups of participants and
analyze each pair. The members of the first pair will
differ in the place and time of the experiment, the
members of the second pair – in the age of
respondents, in the third pair we will compare the
reports of Russian and French participants. For the
main idea of this paper will be important only the
results for the first pair. The results for the second and
the third pair are beyond the general direction and
they will be given an account in the appendix.
Results for the first pair. The structure of groups:
group 1 - 32 persons (15-17-year-old, gender: m – 10,
f – 22, time of the experiment - June 2008, place Ferapontovo, Vologodskaya district); group 2 - 44
person (15-17-year-old, gender: m – 17, f – 27,
December 2008, Moscow). The results are presented
in the tables 1-2.
We can see, that the results are similar in respect
of parameters that are similar in both groups (table 1),
but this results considerably change, if we change the
context of experiment (table 2). The case of this
difference can be described as fallows. There are
many fields and county roads around Ferapontovo and
this is the important factor influencing the choice of a
country road as the main image in group 1. In
Moscow this factor lacks, the context becomes more
usual for participants and in group 2 we can observe
another result.

The choice of the season is changed in a similar
direction. Nobody selected the winter in group 1 (time
of experiment was summer) and 11% selected the
winter in group 2 (time of experiment was winter).

Discussion
The present research is the beginning of a general
investigation of the sentence denotation structure.
These results have a qualitative character and reveal
the problem points for further researches. There are
two basic findings from the present study.
First, the sentence denotation structure isn’t
homogeneous, some its elements are more important
for humans than others. This statement conforms to
the E. Rosch’s investigations of human categorization
(Rosch, 1975; Rosch, 1978) 4 , but, unlike Rosch’s
assertions, the structure changes when event context
becomes different .
Second, the sentence denotation structure isn’t an
external in respect of a person characteristic, but this
is the result of a person, language and the external
world interaction. This statement defines the principal
feature of quantum approach, which distinguishes it
from two described above paradigms. It is impossible
to talk about the sentence meaning without the
interaction with person. The sentence have only
probability to get a meaning in the act of interaction.
The meaning comes into being in this act. The most
frequent and consequently the most probable
interactions cause its base elements. However the
frequency of these interactions can change with
changing the socio-cultural situation. If we describe
these
changes
and
following
semantic
transformations, we will be able to describe language
as a dynamic system.

Results and discussion for the second pair. The
structure of groups: group 2 is the same as in the first
pair; group 3 consists of 26 persons (7-8-year-old,
gender: m – 14, f – 12, September 2008, Moscow 5 ).
The results are presented in the tables 3-4.
We can observe that in group 3 a) the walking
person became considerably younger than in other

One can say that Rosch’s results are a particular case of a
sentence denotation structure studies for the type of
sentences «There is X (color, furniture, bird etc.)».

one and the m.-f. ratio approximated to 1; b) a street
in the city is the only dominating picture. It is
interesting that one of the most frequent images of the
street is a pedestrian crossing (15,4%). The causes of
these results are as follows:
• Children of 7-8-year-old don’t master language
as the social phenomenon and they don’t feel
language limitations which adult participants feel.
• Their consciousness is egocentric and they see in
the walking person themselves or their parents
(they often told about that in their comments).
• Their social experience is firmly connects with
the city and a life in the country passes beyond
them.

On the other hand, it is evident that for French
participants a road is a country road and a path in the
forest and isn’t a street in the city. The results of
group 4 are similar as the results of group 1, not
group 2. There are different ways to clarify why this
is the case. There is one of possible explanations.
Toulouse isn’t a megapolis and the students of
Toulouse university have an experience of a country
life. The Moscow rhythm of life is more far from a
country life than the Toulouse one.

Results and discussion for the third pair. In this
pair group 2 is the same as before and group 4
consists of 42 French participants (18-29-year-old,
gender: m – 8, f – 34, December 2008, Toulouse).
The results are presented in the tables 5-6.
We can see that the most frequent walking
person in group 4 is younger, than in group 2, and the
women is more frequent instance of this person in
group 4, than in group 2 (table 5). This can be
connected with two factors: a person in French is in
the feminine gender (in Russian, repeat, – in the
masculine gender); Russian culture is more traditional
than French and a man of middle age is more typical
for it then a young man or women.
