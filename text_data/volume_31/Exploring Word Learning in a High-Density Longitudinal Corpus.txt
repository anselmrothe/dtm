Abstract
What is the role of the linguistic environment in children’s
early word learning? Here we provide a preliminary analysis of one child’s linguistic development, using a portion of
the high-density longitudinal data collected for the Human
Speechome Project. We focus particularly on the development of the child’s productive vocabulary from the age of 9 to
24 months and the relationship between the child’s language
development and the caregivers’ speech. We find significant
correlations between input frequencies and age of acquisition
for individual words. In addition, caregivers’ utterance length,
type-token ratio, and proportion of single-word utterances all
show significant temporal relationships with the child’s development, suggesting that caregivers “tune” their utterances to
the linguistic ability of the child.

Language Development and the Environment
What is the role of the linguistic environment in a child’s acquisition of language? In attempts to understand the nature
of the mechanisms underlying language acquisition, inputuptake correlations have the potential to provide deep insight.
If particular aspects of children’s input are predictive of their
later language development, such findings could powerfully
illuminate the nature of children’s language learning strategies and mechanisms and the relationship of linguistic knowledge and experience.
Systematic studies of child-directed speech (CDS) dating
back to the late 1960’s have established that CDS has special
characteristics including shorter utterance lengths, exaggerated prosody, high redundancy, and referential content tied
to immediate context (Snow & Ferguson, 1977). Initial investigations of the facilitative role of CDS focused primarily
on development of syntax. Early findings were contradictory,
however, and the overall picture remains mixed (Newport et
al., 1977; Furrow et al., 1979; Pine, 1995). More recent studies of the role of the environment on lexical development
proved to be clearer. For example, studies have shown that
the total amount of CDS predicts children’s vocabulary size
and rate of growth (Huttenlocher et al., 1991; Hart & Risley,
1995) and the frequency of specific words within CDS predicts the age of acquisition of those words (Huttenlocher et
al., 1991; Goodman et al., 2008).
Despite the quantity of work in this area, however, our
overall understanding of the role of the environment in language development remains limited by the lack of appropriate
observational data. Historically, most longitudinal studies of
language development have relied on observations from just

two or a few points in time, leading to difficulties in constructing a complete picture of the continuous developmental process. Driven by new technologies, the methodological landscape is now changing. Higher density longitudinal studies
are emerging that provide valuable new perspectives on longstanding questions. For example, by analyzing 90-120 minute
audio recordings of children’s home environments every two
weeks from 9-15 months of age, Brent & Siskind (2001) shed
new light on the role of words spoken in isolation by showing that their presence in CDS predicted age of acquisition of
those words. More recently, Lieven et al. (in press) recorded
28-30 hours of audio over a 6-week period in the homes of
four toddlers yielding 100,000+ word corpora of CDS and
speech by children from each home. These data were used to
trace the relationship between a child’s utterances over time
in support of a constructivist theory of grammar development.
Motivated by the goal of obtaining a more complete and
naturalistic longitudinal record of child development—and
establishing new tools and methods for replicating such efforts in the future—the Human Speechome Project (HSP)
was launched with the aim of recording the first two to three
years of one child’s development at home in rich detail (Roy
et al., 2006). This paper provides an overview of the HSP
project and corpus, and the human-machine collaborative
process for audio analysis. We then present an initial analysis on a subset of the audio portion of this corpus focusing
on CDS and lexical development.

The Human Speechome Project
The goal of HSP is to study early language development
through analysis of audio and video recordings of the first
two to three years of one child’s life. The home of the family of one of the authors (DR) with a newborn was outfitted
with fourteen microphones and eleven omnidirectional cameras. Audio was recorded from ceiling mounted boundary
layer microphones at 16 bit resolution with a sampling rate of
48 KHz. Due to the unique acoustic properties of boundary
layer microphones, most speech throughout the house including very quiet speech was captured with sufficient clarity to
enable reliable transcription. Video was also recorded to capture non-linguistic context using high resolution fisheye lens
video cameras that provide a bird’s-eye view of people, objects, and activity throughout the home.
Recordings were made from birth to the child’s third birthday with the highest density of recordings focused on the first

the analyses below are based on the audio from 9-24 months.
As with previous longitudinal case studies (Piaget, 1952;
Tomasello, 1992), conclusions about the general nature of
language development that may be drawn from analysis of
the Speechome corpus are inherently limited since the data
charts only one child’s development. However the corpus
differs from previous case studies in important respects. In
contrast to diary studies which are necessarily theory-laden
(since diarists cannot record everything, they must rely on
theoretical biases to decide what is noteworthy at the time of
observation), the Speechome corpus may be re-analyzed multiple times guided by different theoretical perspectives. In addition, the presence of high-resolution video provides opportunities to study the role of various aspects of non-linguistic
context from joint attention to routine activities and beyond.

Human-Machine Data Annotation
Our study of early word learning depends on high accuracy
orthographic (word-level) transcription and speaker identification of both child and caregiver speech. In order to circumscribe this task, we limited speaker identification to the
child and the three primary caregivers (mother, father, and
full-time nanny). Since identifying CDS currently requires
significant human effort, we operationalized the definition to
refer to caregiver speech when the child is awake and close
enough to hear. We refer to this as “child available speech”
(CAS). However, the size of the corpus still presents a daunting challenge. Typical speech transcription tasks take an order of magnitude longer than the actual single-track audio duration, and with several thousand hours of 14 track audio this
approach would be too time-consuming and too costly.

Speech detection, transcription, and speaker ID
To this end we have developed BlitzScribe (Roy, 2007), a system that enables accurate, rapid speech transcription. With
this system, automatic audio processing algorithms are used
to robustly detect speech in the audio and split speech into
short, easy to transcribe segments. Sequences of speech segments are loaded into a specially designed transcription interface that enables a human transcriber to simply listen and
type, obviating the need for manually finding and segmenting speech or explicitly controlling audio playback. As a result, playback stays synchronized to the transcriber’s speed
of transcription. We have found our system to have comparable accuracy (Roy & Roy, under review) to other popular
transcription tools yet is approximately five times faster for
naturalistic audio recordings. Transcribers using this system
can obtain average transcription times of less than twice the
audio duration. In addition to BlitzScribe, we have also developed speaker identification algorithms to automatically label speech segments with the speaker, along with associated
confidence values. Speaker annotation tools allow a human to
review low confidence segments and make corrections as necessary. Using this suite of tools, we expect that a small team

of several annotators, working at 40 hours per week, will be
able to transcribe the corpus in less than a year.

The Speechome Audio Corpus
In the 9-24 month age range, the Speechome audio corpus
contains 4260 hours of 14-track audio of which an estimated
1150 hours contain speech. Of the 488 days that constitute
this age range, recordings were made on 444 of the days with
a mean of 9.6 hours recorded per day. At the time of this
writing, 72 of these days have been fully transcribed with a
mean of 23,055 words per day of combined CAS and child
speech for a total of 1.66 million words. These 72 days of
transcribed speech are evenly distributed over the 16 month
range. Based on these statistics, the corpus contains an estimated 10.2 million words of CAS and child speech in total
over the 9-24 month range. Our long term goal is to fully
annotate all speech in the corpus with transcriptions, speaker
identity, and prosodic features.
Three limitations of the speech annotation process required
us to filter the 1.66 million words of transcripts and only use
a subset of the transcripts for the current analyses. First,
roughly 700,000 words belong to utterances marked by human transcribers as containing more than one speaker. In
other words, about 40% of pause separated spoken utterances
contain abutting or overlapping speech of two or more people reflecting the realities of “speech in the wild.” Since our
objective here is to examine interaction of CAS and child
speech, we removed these utterances since we cannot currently distinguish the source of speech. Second, to reduce errors due to automatic speaker identification, we sorted utterances based on a confidence metric produced by the speaker
identification algorithm and removed the bottom ˜50% of utterances. Third, about 15% of the remaining utterances were
deemed by human transcribers to be of insufficient clarity to
reliably transcribe. After removing those utterances, we obtained the 399,141 word corpus used for all analyses in this
paper.

The Child’s Productive Lexicon
While the current level of resolution does not allow us to pinpoint exactly how much speech the child produced or the absolute first time the child produced a token of a word, the
current density (about a day in every week is transcribed)
does allow us to estimate for the first time a variety of different continuous measures. We begin by presenting descriptive
measures of the child’s language development in this section,
and move on to analyses in the next section that attempt to
capture coordination between the caregivers and the child.

The child as conversational participant
The child’s language development is visible even at a very
coarse grain of analysis. Figure 1 shows the proportion of
all utterances attributed to each speaker with high confidence
by the speaker ID system. The child goes from producing
essentially no transcribable speech at 9 months to producing

Word births
Our next analysis examined the child’s lexical development
on a word-by-word basis. We did this by defining a word
birth: the first time in our transcripts that a word entered
the child’s productive vocabulary. We used this technique
to extract a set of candidate word births automatically from
corpus data. We then analyzed this list by hand, removing
morphological variants of already-born words (e.g., gerunds
and plurals) and categorizing words into the categories listed
on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) (Fenson et al., 1994). We found 517 word
births in the corpus by these criteria, of which 265 appeared
in the CDI checklist.
The distribution of word births by age was smooth but
highly non-linear (Figure 2, top). Word births as measured
by our technique increased until 20 months, at which point
they decreased quickly.1 In addition, the category structure of
the child’s vocabulary shifts rapidly over the course of the period between 9-20 months (Figure 2, bottom). At 20 months,
corresponding to the peak of word births observed in the top
panel, the composition of the lexicon appears to stabilize.

Word frequency analyses
Relations between input and output have often been investigated in the domain of frequency, both in the general frequency of CDS (Hart & Risley, 1995) and in connections be1 We believe this pattern of increase and decrease is the result
of several interacting factors. First, as the child’s vocabulary grows
larger, the probability of observing a new word sampled from that
vocabulary grows smaller. Second, as the child learns the most frequent words in the language, newer words will for the most part be
less frequent words and hence will be less likely to be detected even
in dense sampling.

tween the specific frequencies of words in CDS and the age
at which they are acquired (Huttenlocher et al., 1991; Goodman et al., 2008). Our goal was to replicate this second set
of analyses in the Speechome corpus, evaluating correlations
between the frequency of words in CDS and their age of acquisition according to the word-birth analysis reported above.
To perform this analysis, we regressed the word birth date
for each word in the child’s productive vocabulary against
the total, non-normalized log frequency of that word in the
speech of the three caregivers. The results of this analysis are
shown in Figure 3, left. We found a significant correlation
between frequency and age of acquisition across all words
(r = −.29, p < .0001). While Goodman et al. (2008) found
a positive correlation across all words, their CDS corpus contains speech directed at older children and may contain a
higher proportion of closed class words. This could be one
factor leading to different results. However, when we investigated individual groups of words (as shown in the CDI data),
we found heterogeneity among them (examples are shown in
Figure 3, middle and right panels). In general, replicating the
results of Goodman et al. (2008), noun categories were most
highly correlated with frequency, while closed class words
were least correlated. It should be noted that only words acquired by 24 months were used in the regression, potentially

overestimating or underestimating the correlation. We were
also interested in whether these correlations held when only
the caregiver word counts prior to a word birth were considered. As Goodman et al. (2008) point out, it may be that an
earlier word birth leads to higher overall usage of that word
by caregivers. However, if caregiver word frequency is calculated only up to the word birth date, the correlations decrease
somewhat but the effect remains. Thus, within speech to a
single child, we found a strong relationship between input
frequency and age of acquisition, although this relationship
was presumably mediated by a number of other factors, including syntactic category.

Tuning of caregivers’ utterances
Claims about the facilitative role of caregivers’ speech have
typically hinged on the concept of “tuning”: whether caregivers change the form of their utterances in order to accommodate the linguistic knowledge of the child. In our next
analyses, we studied the form of caregivers’ utterances. Our
goal was to test two versions of the tuning hypothesis. First,
we were interested in characterizing what we will call “coarse
tuning”: adjustment of caregivers’ speech to the general linguistic competence of the child. Coarse lexical tuning predicts that a caregiver will generally use shorter utterances that
are less lexically diverse when talking to a child whose vocabulary and word-combination abilities are limited.
The second version of the tuning hypothesis we call “fine
lexical tuning”: adjustment of caregivers’ speech at the level
of individual lexical items. (The term“fine tuning” has previously been used in the literature simply as a catchall term for
tuning phenomena, but here we distinguish different levels of
the tuning hypothesis). Fine lexical tuning predicts that caregivers will not only adjust their speech to the general level
of the child, they will also adjust the complexity of individual utterances on the basis of the familiarity of the child with
their lexical content.

Coarse tuning
In our first set of analyses, we computed three descriptive
measures of caregivers’ speech for each month in our sample. Our hypothesis was that if caregivers were engaging in
coarse tuning, we would see temporal changes in the characteristics of their speech coordinated with the linguistic development of the child. The first measure was the mean length
of caregivers’ utterances (MLU) (Moerk, 1976).2 Our second
measure was the proportion of single-word utterances in caregivers’ speech. This measure was directly related to MLU,
but since single word utterances had previously been identified as a significant source of information in early word learning (Brent & Siskind, 2001), we computed this measure separately. The final measure was the type-token ratio (TTR) in
caregivers’ speech. TTR is a measure which captures the lexical diversity of a set of contexts. A high TTR for a word suggests that a word appeared in diverse contexts which shared
few words with one another; in contrast, a low TTR suggests
that the word appeared in a smaller range of contexts or contexts which shared many words with one another.
Results of these analyses are shown in Figure 4. We found
significant correlations between the child’s MLU trajectory
and the MLU trajectories of all three of his caregivers (Pearson’s r was .55, .57, and .62, with p-values of .03, .02, and
.01, for C1-C3 respectively). The child’s utterances were exclusively one word long in the period from 9 to 15 months. In
his 16th month, his MLU began to increase and rose rapidly
thereafter (to a level of ˜2.6 in the month of his second birthday). Caregivers’ speech appeared to decrease in MLU until
about the time when the child began combining words around
16 months; at this point their MLUs all began increasing. Although more detailed analyses are necessary, this pattern may
correspond to a shift in the proportion of utterances for which
2 We

report MLU based on the number of orthographic words—
as opposed to morphemes—in each utterance segmented by our automatic system. Thus the MLU figures reported may not be directly
comparable to estimates of MLU computed via other methods.

the child’s understanding was useful or necessary.
The other two measures we computed (single-word utterance proportion and TTR) have not typically been used as
measures of the complexity of children’s speech, so we examined only in the caregiver data and looked for change over
the period of interest. Our measure of single-word utterance prevalence varied across caregivers but showed significant temporal structure. Two caregivers’ single-word utterance proportions showed a significant decrease across the period of recording in a linear regression against age (for C1,
p = .002 and for C2, p = .01) while C3 showed no linear
trend (p = .83) but seemed to show some quadratic trend with
single-word utterance proportion peaking around the same
time-period as the dip in MLU. In contrast, when we examined the TTR data, C2 exhibited a very strong increasing linear trend with age (p < .001) and no trend (or possibly a slight
uptick towards the end of recording) for C1 and C3. Although
it must remain speculative with such a small sample of caregivers, there is the possibility that the different caregivers mitigated the complexity of their utterances with different strategies, with C1 and C3 using more single word utterances and
C2 using highly restricted contexts.
To summarize: we saw significant temporal structure in
both the length and lexical diversity of caregivers’ utterances,
indicating a relationship between the linguistic abilities of the
child and the speech of the caregivers. These data add to the
literature supporting coarse tuning and suggesting that caregivers adapt the length and lexical complexity of their utterances to what they think their child can understand.

Fine lexical tuning
Our final analyses tested the hypothesis of fine lexical
tuning—that caregivers not only tailor their utterances to the
general linguistic ability of the child, but that they may also

adjust the complexity of the contexts in which they present
individual words depending on the child’s understanding of
those words.
To carry out this analysis, we re-examined the MLU data
for each caregiver. For each word in the child’s productive
vocabulary, we extracted the MLU for each month for the utterances containing that word. This resulted in an MLU timeseries for each caregiver for each word; we re-centered these
time-series so that they were aligned by the word birth (when
the child first produced the word). We then calculated the
change in MLU for each word relative to the month in which
the child began producing it, and averaged across words.3 Intuitively, this analysis allow us to look at whether there is
a consistent change in caregiver MLU before and after the
child knows how to use a word. The results are shown for
each caregiver in Figure 5. We found a systematic decrease
in the MLU of words immediately prior to the child’s first
production of that word, without a corresponding rise afterwards. Both the directionality and the magnitude of these
changes was different than those observed in the earlier analysis of coordination in MLU and suggest that there is likely
some level of fine lexical tuning in caregivers’ speech. These
changes additionally suggest that the noisy, unaligned data
shown in Figure 4 (which naturally included many words that
the child did not produce) may have obscured the fine-tuning
of utterance complexity for those words that the child was
able to produce.
Although this analysis shows the promise of the Speechome corpus (since analyses of CDS time-series data at the
level of single words have never before been possible), it also

words appear in multiple utterances (and more words
appear, by definition, in longer utterances) absolute MLU in this
calculation is biased upwards. Thus, we normalize the MLU curves
by subtracting the MLU at the time of word birth.

reveals the limitations of even the current dataset. Without
denser data it is impossible to look at coordination in the short
window of time immediately before and after the child’s production of a new word, and these short temporal dynamics
may also reveal effects of fine tuning.

Conclusions
The Human Speechome Project represents a novel opportunity to explore hypotheses about the relationship between
caregivers’ speech and the linguistic abilities of the child. We
found evidence that word frequency in CDS influences the
child’s age of acquisition for those words. We also found
strong evidence for caregivers’ modification of the length and
lexical diversity of their utterances contingent on the child’s
linguistic ability. In addition, we found some support for
a finer level of lexical tuning, the modification of utterance
length on a word-by-word basis according to whether the
child knows that word or not.
More generally, the current analyses constitute only a first
look at an extremely rich dataset. As transcription progresses,
we can look forward to enriching a number of the current
analyses with more accurate assessments of the child’s productive vocabulary and the short-term dynamics of caregivers’ speech surrounding the first use of a word. Furthermore, the visual information contained in our database offers
an unparalleled opportunity to explore more detailed questions about the interaction between linguistic and physical
context in acquisition. Our hope is that through the power
of this resource we may be able to make new progress on
long-standing questions in child language development.
