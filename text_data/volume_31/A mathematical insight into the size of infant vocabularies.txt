10% more words (6.0) than an average infant (5.3). However,
after a non-linear transformation, this result does not hold. If,
as an example, actual vocabulary sizes are the square of direct
CDI scores, infant B would then know about 10% less words
than an average infant (36 vs. 39.3).
   The results can also offer additional information for those
interested in characterising the vocabulary spurt often ob-
served at the end of the second year of life. Many researchers
attempt to identify an inflection point in the increasing vo-
cabulary size. Often, direct measure from the CDI indicates
a slowing-down in the speed of acquisition of new words af-
ter the spurt. Again, the non-linearity of the correction sug-
gests more caution in the analysis of vocabulary sizes as the
deceleration is likely to disappear after the vocabulary size
correction.
   Finally, the analysis of the amount of overlap between in-
dividual vocabularies suggests that the absolute number of id-
iosyncratic words does not change with age, over the consid-
ered age range. This observation may offer some important
