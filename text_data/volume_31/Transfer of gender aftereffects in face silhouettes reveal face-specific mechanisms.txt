were either all female or all male adaptors, similar to the
endpoints on the gender axis in Figure 2. To make the 8
male or 8 female faces look different from one another, they

were not correlated with gender perception. The 9th
silhouette was always the same gender-neutral silhouette
(middle stimulus in Figure 2). The 8 adaptors were rated on
attractiveness, race, or age, and only the target silhouette
was rated on gender. We refer to this method as “rapid”              Figure 3. A sample questionnaire used in Study 1. The first

Of 122 subjects who participated in the first study, 59 were
randomly assigned to the adapt-female condition, and 63 to
the adapt-male condition. The variable of interest was the
proportion of female responses to the target silhouette, as a
function of the adaptation condition. Only 2 of 59 adapt-
female subjects rated the target silhouette as “female”,
compared to 39 of 63 adapt-male subjects (Chi-
square(1)=47, p < .001), equivalent to 79% aftereffect-
consistent ratings, significantly above 50% chance (Figure
4-Study1). These results indicate that face silhouettes elicit
gender aftereffects, and that these aftereffects can be
detected in a rapid, implicit adaptation paradigm. The fact
that more judgments consistent with adaptation were
obtained in the adapt-female condition likely reflects the
fact that our “neutral” target face looked slightly male to
some of our subjects. This bias is orthogonal to the effect of
interest and does not affect our result.                              Figure 4. Percent of aftereffect-consistent ratings of the
