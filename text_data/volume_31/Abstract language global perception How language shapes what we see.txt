For example, it can be argued that sentences with implict
arguments are more abstract than sentences with explicit
arguments. As it happens, ambitransitive verbs (e.g., Dixon
and Aikhenvaid, 2000) offer a perfect opportunity to study
this difference. Ambitransitives are verbs (such as “read”)                Figure 1: An exmple trial of the Perceptual Focus Task,
