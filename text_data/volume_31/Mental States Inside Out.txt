Abstract: Mental states, such as thinking and remembering or feeling angry, happy, or dizzy, have a clear internal
component. Barsalou (1999) proposes that introspective experiences are simulated when people understand concep-
tual references to these mental states. However, mental states can also be described from an external perspective,
in which not an inner experience, but an external expression or action may be simulated. In a paradigm based on
the property verification task, we presented sentences describing mental states (i.e. emotional, visceral and cognitive
states) and contrasted sentences with an internal or external focus. Results show that switching costs occur when
participants shift between sentences with an internal and external focus, suggesting that different forms of simula-
tion underlie understanding these sentences. In addition, these findings also imply that references to very different
categories of mental states are grounded in a similar way; through the process of simulation.
