Re-examining the status of Logic in the Psychology of Reasoning
Marian Counihan
University of Amsterdam
Abstract: This poster focusses on the role of logic in theories of reasoning, with particular attention for the status
of logic in the field of psychology of reasoning.
Much recent reasoning research has downplayed the usefulness of logic in understanding reasoning behaviour,
primarily because of the many negative findings in the field regarding our ability to reasoning logically. But I will
argue that such negative findings have been based on a simplistic understanding of the relation between meaning and
logic, which plays out in assumptions about the logical form of reasoning premises. Insights from formal semantics
and philosophy of language regarding the nature of linguistic meaning help to resolve this misunderstanding and
allow us to reguage the logicality in subjects reasoning. I illustrate the this with the case of research on reasoning
with quantifiers. Finally, I highlight the relevance of this topic for other areas in the cognitive sciences.
