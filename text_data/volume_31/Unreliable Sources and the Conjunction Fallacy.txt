The conjunction fallacy is arguably one of the best-known               REPL and REPU, finally, are report variables representing

consists of judging the conjunction of two statements, one
likely (L) and one unlikely (U), as more likely than the least
likely statement ( P(L,U) > P(U) ) (Tversky & Kahneman,
1983). At least for the original testing paradigm, the fallacy
has proven to be robust (but see e.g., Hertwig, Benz &
Krauss, 2008, on different versions of the problem). Yet,
twenty-six years of extensive research1 have failed to
produce an adequate account of the phenomenon (Fisk,
2004).
  Here a novel Bayesian account of the conjunction fallacy
is assessed. Bovens and Hartman (2003) argue that it is
natural to take into consideration the reliability of sources
when judging the probability of statements. In particular,              Figure 1: Bovens and Hartman‟s model of the conjunction
viewing experimenters as less than fully reliable sources is            fallacy as a Bayesian Network (adapted from Bovens and
