drawings prepared by the experimenter: a dot and a
horizontal line.
   Children were interviewed individually in a quiet room at
their preschool. Each child began with a warm up (coloring
a triangle) on the first placemat, and then the placemat was
removed. The two drawings (dot and line) were placed in
the center of the table. The experimenter asked the child to
label the dot and line (“What is this? You’re right, it’s a
dot!”). If the child labeled one of the drawings differently
(e.g. by calling the dot a “circle”) than the child’s label was
used throughout the experiment. After the drawings were
labeled, the experimenter placed the next colored placemat
in front of the child and put a piece of paper on top. Then
the first trial (Free Drawing or Constrained Drawing,
counterbalanced) began.
