                           Method
Participants
   84 undergraduate students with normal or corrected-to-
normal vision from Simon Fraser University participated in
this study for pay or course credit. 13 were excluded due to
excessive eye-tracker errors or failing to complete all trials.
Stimuli and Categories
   The stimuli participants learned to categorize were images
of microorganisms containing three organelles (see Figure 1,
top panel). In order to create these stimuli, we created a pool
of 90 images for each of the three organelles representing
the three category features, or dimensions. One feature was
an organelle that varied along an orientation dimension,
with each successive image changing by 1.5º of rotation.
The second feature was a crescent-shaped elongated oval
that differed along a curvature dimension, with each
successive image altered by 1º of arc aptitude. The third
feature was a circle filled with white that differed along a
size dimension, with each successive image containing a
slightly smaller white disc. Figure 1 (bottom panel) shows
these features at the extreme and midpoint values.
   The stimulus feature values for the two conditions were
generated using bivariate distributions similar to those used
by Ashby and Gott (1988) with parameter values shown in
Table 1. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two
possible category structures: rule-based (RB) or information
integration (II) (Figure 2). Correct categorization of a
stimulus in the RB condition required checking one relevant
feature; two features were always irrelevant. Correct                  Figure 1. Stimuli used in the experiment. The top panel
