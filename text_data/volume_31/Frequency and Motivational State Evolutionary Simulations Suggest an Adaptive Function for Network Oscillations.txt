decreasing intensity with respect to the distance from the
entity. The network produced output to the motor actuators
on both sides of the agent, enabling a tank like propulsion.
The strength of the network’s connections, which were
hereditary, and could only change over generations,
determined the behavior of the agent. For instance, if the
connections from each sensor relayed the sensors’ activation
to the motor actuators on the opposite side, the agent turned
toward the source of the scent. The sensor closest to the
source would detect the scent with greater intensity,
resulting in a greater thrust by the motor actuator on the
opposite side than the thrust on the sensor’s side. In
contrast, if the networks had parallel excitatory connections,
the agent would turn away from the source. In the
