Abstract: Recent findings indicate substantial changes between the ages of 18- and 24-months in childrens integra-
tion of object properties with their actions on objects. Here we report new results from shape sorting and posting
tasks in an attempt to understanding how motor and visual developments (or their combination) may contribute
to this period of rapid development. Toddlers aged 18-months participated in four experiments involving insert-
ing objects into openings. Results suggest that the key developmental achievements reside not in visual or motor
developments alone, but in their integration.
