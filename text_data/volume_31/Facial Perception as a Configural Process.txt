Abstract: Configural or gestalt processing are general terms given to phenomena where the whole is different from
the sum of its parts. Here we explore these phenomena through face perception, a known configural process. In this
experiment, subjects are presented with a split face recognition task with manipulations on the presence or absence
and the salience of each half, the famous composite face design. It is one of a number of perceptual experimental
designs based on selective attention and the presence or absence of interference expressed in RT or accuracy. We
performed a replication of this task and then added a design based on divided attention. Systems factorial technology
is employed to draw conclusions regarding architecture, stopping rule, capacity and independence
