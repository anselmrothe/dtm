Abstract: This research is focusing whether instruction on two aspects of invention can improve students ability to
invent. The first is the strategy of functional decomposition which previous studies show can reduce the complexity
of the invention processes. The second is the role of evaluation functions for assessing the products of the invention
processes. Preliminary results of a study with engineering students attempting to solve an invention problem will
be described. In a two-by-two factorial design students will be taught the strategy of functional decomposition or
not, and will be given an evaluation function to use or not. The students in the no training condition will be given
general autobiographies of inventors to read. Concurrent verbal protocols will be obtained during the trials and
retrospective debriefing conducted.
