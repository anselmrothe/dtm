difficult for young children. The task was even more
challenging when distinct objects were placed at each
location in the two boxes in such a way that corresponding
objects were not in corresponding locations (the objects
were cross-mapped). However, when the locations of the
boxes were described with spatial language (e.g., on, in,
under or top, middle, bottom), children were able to
successfully align the two boxes and find the hidden toy.
   As in Markman and Gentner’s and Richland et al.’s
studies, the present studies asked children to view pairs of
scenes with familiar relations and to select an object from a
target picture that corresponded with a particular object
from the base picture. However, in our task the key variable
was whether children heard relational language to describe
the pictures. Given previous research suggesting that
relational language enhances children’s analogical abilities,
we expected that children who heard relational language
would outperform children who heard neutral language.

     In Richland et al.’s studies, the distracting object was present
in the second picture but was not part of the main relational
structure. In contrast, Markman and Gentner (and Gentner and
Toupin) used cross-mapped examples, in which the object
participated in the matching relation but in a different role. The
impact of different types of object distractors on children’s
analogical performance was examined directly in Experiment 2.                 Figure 1: Sample stimuli pictures from Experiment 1.

than 5½-year-olds, although this effect was only marginally
significant, F(1,60) = 3.12, p = .08. However, a main effect
of Language Type was significant, F(1,60) = 6.52, p < .05.
Children who heard relational language chose the relational
match more often than children who heard neutral language.
Although the Age x Language interaction was not
significant, when the two age groups were analyzed
separately, the relational language advantage was found
only for the 7-year-olds, F(1,60) = 7.33, p < .01.
Discussion
As predicted, hearing relational language helped children
make an appropriate relational match, despite a compelling
object match. Given how strongly young children are drawn

                                                         employed Age and Language Type as between-subjects
                                                         factors. Additionally, a within-subjects factor of Pair Type
                                                         was added to the design, resulting in a 2 x 2 x 3 mixed
                                                         design. In Experiment 1, the pairs were designed so that the
                                                         object match, or distractor, was always cross-mapped from
                                                         the base to the target picture. Experiment 2 also used cross-
                                                         mapped pairs, in addition to pairs in which the object match
                                                         was external to the relation and pairs in which there was no

                                                         distractor participated in the same relation in the target
                                                         picture as in the base picture (e.g., towing), but in a different
                                                         role (e.g., towee versus tower) (Figure 3c). On external
                                                         distractor trials, the distractor did not participate in the

                                                         3b). On no-distractor trials, no object distractor was present
                                                         in the target picture (Figure 3a). The direction of the relation
                                                         (e.g., towing from right to left) was varied within pairs so
                                                         that spatial location could not be used as a proxy for a

                                                            Children saw a total of nine experimental picture pairs
                                                         (three of each type), each exemplifying a different relation
                                                         (e.g., towing). The type of pair seen for each relation was
                                                         counterbalanced across participants. In addition to the nine
                                                         experimental trials, children also saw three practice trials,
                                                         one of each pair type, for a total of twelve picture pairs. No
                                                         fillers were used in Experiment 2.
                                                         Procedure The general format of Experiment 2 roughly
                                                         follows that of Experiment 1, but the wording of the
                                                         instructions and questions were modified to resemble those
                                                         used by Richland et al. (2006). Specifically, children were
                                                         instructed that the pictures had a common “pattern” and that
                                                         they should use this pattern to match the pictures. The
                                                         experimenter began by laying down the first pair of practice
                                                         pictures, with the base above the target, and saying:
                                                            “There is a certain pattern in the top picture, and the same
                                                            pattern happens in the bottom picture, but it looks different.
                                                            Let me show you what I mean. See, in the top picture, there is

                                                            elephant holding a cat. See, the same pattern happens in both,
                                                            but it looks different. Now, in this game, first you have to
                                                            figure out what the pattern is that happens in both pictures.
                                                            Then I am going to point to one thing in the top picture, and

As predicted, children who heard relational language chose
the relational match more often than those who did not. This
was confirmed by a 2(Age) x 2(Language Type) x 3(Pair
Type) mixed measures ANOVA over children’s relational
responses, where Age and Language Type were between-
subjects factors (Figure 4). Main effects of Age, F(1,43) =
11.79, p < .01, and Language Type, F(1,43) = 13.06, p <
.01, were significant. The 5½-year-olds chose the relational
match significantly more often than the 3½-year-olds, and
children who heard relational language chose the relational
match significantly more often than those who did not. A
main effect of Pair Type was also significant, F(2,86) =
3.92, p < .05. As in prior research, children chose the
relational match significantly more often when there was no
distracting object match present.
   The main effects of Pair Type and Language Type are
best understood in light of their interaction, F(2,86) = 5.22,
p < .01. Children who heard relational language chose the
relational match as frequently on trials with a distractor
(external or cross-mapped) as on those with no distractor. In
contrast, children who heard neutral language chose the
relational match significantly more frequently when there
was no distractor than with either external or cross-mapped
distractors (both Bonferronis, p < .01). Performance on the
external and cross-mapped trials did not differ significantly.
The three-way interaction with Age was not significant,
suggesting that a similar pattern was found at both ages.
Discussion
In Experiment 2, as predicted, relational language helped
children to select the appropriate relational match and
ignore tempting object matches. In fact, children were just                 Figure 4: Mean proportion of relational choices in
