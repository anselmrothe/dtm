                        Experiment
The main purpose of the experiment in this paper is to test
whether a model of external anticipations based on an echo
state network (ESN), could be implemented in a mobile
robot and be made to generate “mental” simulations.
Although, the robot model at this point does not map
entirely to the possible simulation pathways of the
neocortex described above, the ESN has been shown to
exhibit some of the computational properties of the
neocortex. Thus, the focus is here to come up with an
existence proof rather than a full implementation and
account of the view of simulation outlined above.                        Figure 2. (Left) Webots simulator. (Right) Motion
