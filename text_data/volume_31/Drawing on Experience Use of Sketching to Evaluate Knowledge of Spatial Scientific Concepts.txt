The development of expertise is a central issue in cognitive
science and education. Understanding the paths by which
people acquire mastery in a domain is important both in                                 Figure 1. Example of a fault

Geoscience requires learning about complex, large-scale
processes that occur over large ranges of space and time.
These include the structure of the Earth’s interior, the
deformation processes that occur within its crust (e.g., folds,
faults, and fissures) and unifying both, the model of plate
tectonics. All these topics are deeply spatial.
  Consider the simple concept of a fault (see Figure 1).
Faults are defined by the spatial relationship between the
blocks of rock along a fracture. For the experienced
geoscientist, this perceptual information is connected to                             Figure 2. Diagram of Subduction
