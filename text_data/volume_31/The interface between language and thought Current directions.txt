        In German, grammatical gender assignment is
independent of the referent's biological sex (e.g., even a
male giraffe is grammatically treated as feminine, and
referred to by the female pronoun). We investigated
whether grammatical gender affects German speakers'
deductive reasoning about sex-specific biological
properties. For this purpose, we tested German- and
Japanese-speaking children and adults on a series of
deductive reasoning tasks. The grammatical gender
contributed more strongly than the animal's typicality
(how typical the target animal was as a member of the
animal category) for predicting German 5-year-olds'
