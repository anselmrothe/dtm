Abstract: Previous literature has reported a weak but robust sex difference in the orienting of spatial attention
toward uninformative eye-gaze cues, which was not found for the orienting toward uninformative peripheral cues.
However, whether the sex difference in attentional orienting was due to differential top-down control or simply
reflected strategic difference in following experimental instructions remains to be clarified. In this study, informative
cues (eye-gaze, arrow, and peripheral flashes) were adopted to examine whether females and males have differential
strength of top-down attentional control. The results indicate that, counterpredictive peripheral flashes and arrows
elicited greater validity effects in females than in males but eye-gaze cues did not. The current findings will be
discussed in the context of the interaction between the top-down attentional control and social cognition.
