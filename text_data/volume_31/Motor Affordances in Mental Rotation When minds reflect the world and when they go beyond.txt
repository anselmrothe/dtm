engaged in the same mental task. Results indicate that
people are significantly slower to mentally rotate objects
that are more difficult to physically rotate when they use a
motor mental rotation strategy. However, this reaction time
difference goes away when participants are instructed to use
a purely visual strategy for mental rotation. When
participants are not given any strategy instructions their
overall reaction times speed up, suggesting that the mind is
free to find a more efficient way to solve these tasks when
left to its own devices.
