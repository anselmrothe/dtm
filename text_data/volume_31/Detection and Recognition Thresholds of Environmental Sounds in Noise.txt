                          Introduction
Humans detect and recognize sound sources to interpret and
act on events in their environment. However, surprisingly
little research has been aimed at understanding
environmental sound recognition. Some interesting studies
in this field are Gaver (1993), Ballas (1993), Gygi, Kidd, &
Watson (2007), and Guastavino (2007). Research on human
everyday listening (defined conform Gaver, 1993) can
provide a broader and more integrated understanding of                         Figure 1 Overview of the experimental design. The 10

   The selected target sounds were mixed with pink noise to
create the experimental stimuli. The average loudness of the
masking noise was kept constant. Consequently the
loudness of the target sound was adjusted to reach the
desired maximum local SNR. This method was chosen to
prevent the loudness of the noise from becoming a predictor
for the target sound or sound type. Additionally, all stimuli
were changed to a standard duration of four seconds to
prevent signal duration as a predictor of the source.
