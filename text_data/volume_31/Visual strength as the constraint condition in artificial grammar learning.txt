                               Abstract
  Previous research using the chain of compound letters as
  letter strings in artificial grammar learning (AGL) suggested
  that visual saliency known as global precedence influenced
  the extent of learning. In this study the luminance of letter
  strings in the learning phase was manipulated to investigate
  the effect of visual input on AGL regardless of top down
  attention control. As a result, participants assigned to the low
  luminance condition were not able to learn any grammar even
  though they could percept letter strings in the learning phase.
  This finding suggested that AGL is influenced by the visual
  saliency from outer environment independently of top down
  attention control. The results implied that AGL mechanism as
  adaptive system is affected both by the top down selective
  attention to acquire covariance sensitively and by the bottom
  up visual saliency from the complex environment rather than
  automatic processing system.

                           Background
Implicit learning is a generic term used to refer to the
phenomena that observers can implicitly identify the
covariation between some variables when exposed to large
amounts of information in order to adapt to their
environment (Reber, 1989). Artificial grammar learning                 Figure 1: Artificial grammars used in this study. The
