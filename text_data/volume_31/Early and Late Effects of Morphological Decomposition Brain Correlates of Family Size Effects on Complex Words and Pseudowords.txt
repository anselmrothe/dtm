Summary
In three ERP experiments, morphology-based decomposition
of words and pseudowords was explored in Spanish. Subjects
were asked to perform a lexical decision task on
morphologically simple (e.g. ‘sun’) and complex (e.g.
‘allerg+ic’, ‘allerg+ist’) word strings, while family size for
both lexemes/stems (S-FS) and morphemes/suffixes (M-FS)
was varied. In Experiment I, earlier results by Schreuder &
Baayen (1997) were replicated: Monomorphemic High-FS
targets produced faster responses than monomorphemic LowFS targets. On the whole, mean voltage amplitudes for Low
FS were higher than for High FS; the actual process takes
place, however, at a late stage. In Experiment II, where lexical
roots were used as primes, late Family Size effects emerged.
Lexical decisions were based principally on lexicality. In
Experiment III, words and pseudowords were matched for
Stem Family Size and Morpheme Family Size was
manipulated: morphemes were used as primes. Word and
pseudoword targets which contained a high family size (HFS)
morpheme require 21ms less than word and pseudoword
targets which did not, showing that HFS morphemes facilitate
word recognition. Our data with monomorphemic words
seems to support Schreuder & Baayen's (1995) model. Results
with polymorphemic words cannot be accommodated within a
framework that ignores the relationship between whole word
and morpheme.
Keywords: lexeme family size; morpheme family size;
morphological decomposition; visual word recognition.

Exploring Morphological Decomposition
Although it is generally acknowledged that morphology
has an important role to play in language comprehension
and production (Anderson, 1992; Aronoff, 1994), it
remains unclear what that role actually is. Some authors
contend that whole-word representations are stored
directly in the brain (Butterworth, 1983); others propose
that only morphemic units and their combinatorial
constraints are stored, without any role for whole-word
representations (Taft, & Forster, 1975). More recent
models accept the coexistence of interlinked whole-word
and morphological representations (Caramazza, Laudanna
& Romani, 1988). The problem with this contention is the
way morphological structure relates to lexical structure
and the way this information is conveyed by any lexical
unit, whether a lexeme or a morpheme. In this sense we
must consider not only the peculiarities of the different
languages studied (Longtin & Meunier, 2005), but also
the fact that there are several different morphological

processes at work, each with different theoretical
implications. Both of these factors impede direct
extrapolation of results. Some authors postulate that there
are individual links between words and morphemes
within a specific morphological family framework
(Bybee, 1985). However, such morphological families are
defined by structural word properties such as sharing a
common stem or pertaining to a common semantic field.
It has long been debated whether or not lexical units can
be defined independently of the meaning conveyed.
Access to lexical composition might be prelexical,
implying that a particular word is decomposed into
smaller lexical units, (Fabre, Meunier & Hoen, 2007;
Meunier & Longtin, 2007), or postlexical, meaning that a
whole word should be active before its morphemic units
can be accessed (Giraudo & Grainger, 2001, 2003).
Whilst it is somewhat unclear whether morphemes and
lexemes can be treated as analogous lexical units, there is
linguistic evidence that concept instantiation for a
particular word is always made by concatenating a root or
stem with a morpheme, at least in every compositional
language and concatenative grammar.
A preliminary experiment was conducted to replicate a
Family Size effect originally reported by Schreuder and
Baayen (1997, 3rd Experiment) in Spanish, with
behavioral and ERP responses recorded simultaneously in
order to study the temporal course of the effects. In the
original paper, Family Size was defined as the number of
lexical entries that can be constructed from a lexical stem
by concatenating legal morphemes, and only behavioral
data was used. Two additional experiments were then
conducted, in which subjects were asked to perform a
lexical decision task on morphologically complex words
and pseudowords, manipulating family size of both
lexemes (S-FS) and morphemes (M-FS). Our hypothesis
was that if subjects are sensitive to Family Size variations
in complex words, they must have broken a lexical
candidate down into its lexical sub-units. A FS effect in
either direction, would be evidence in favor of the
morphological decomposition models, as opposed to fulllisting models (De Jong, Schreuder & Baayen, 2000). In
addition, if this parsing followed by concatenation
actually occurs, the EEG will reveal the temporal
sequence of processes involved, providing some evidence
for pre- or postlexical models.

General Methodology
Using SuperLab 4.0 software (Cedrus Corporation, 2006)
in every experiment, right-handed native Spanish readers
with normal or corrected-to-normal vision are serially
presented in sequence with a fixation point (0.5s), blank
screen (0.5s), postmasked word-string prime (70ms)
(experiments II and III only), and postmasked word or
pseudoword target (1.5s). Readers were then asked to
make a lexical decision while brain activity was recorded
using a 64-electrode cap and BrainVision Recording
System. Response times (RTs), and Evoked-Related
Potentials (ERP) were taken as dependent measures. Error
rates (ER) were also taken as a control for efficiency. RTs
were measured from the target onset until subjects made a
response.
Cross-trial average ERPs elicited by the stimuli were
computed for each participant, and then averaged across
subjects for every combination of Lexical Status (LS) and
Family Size (FS), according to the design. The average
amplitude in the 300ms pre-probe interval (when no
stimulus is being presented before a new trial) was taken
as the baseline. The time epoch extended from 300ms
prior to probe onset until 1000ms into the response
interval. ERPs elicited by the probes were computed for
each of 6 latency peaks (70, 100, 170, 200, 300, 400) by
averaging amplitudes over the peak latency interval (-25,
+25ms), once DC and ocular artifacts were removed.
Since error rate was very low, all trials were used.
Impedances were kept below 2kΩ.
Repeated-measures by-subject (F1) and by-item (F2)
ANOVAs for behavioral and ERP measures were
performed separately. ERP measures in the relevant
variables were obtained for each time interval and each
major brain area by averaging amplitudes of all electrodes
in the area. Only RTs and ERPs of correct responses less
than 2.5 standard deviations from the average were used.

Experiment I: Monomorphemic Words
In this first experiment, an original design by Schreuder
and Baayen (1997, 3rd Experiment) is replicated. Thus a 2
(Lexical Status: Word (W) vs. Pseudoword (PW)) ×2
(Family Size (FS): High vs. Low) incomplete factorial
design is used, where Pseudowords are not distributed
according to Family Size. Neighborhood Density (ND),
Syllable Length (SL) and Letter-string Length (LL) were
also controlled. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics
for the relevant variables.

(1997), all pseudowords were created by changing one
letter of an existing word, the result conforming to the
phonotactic and orthotactic constraints of Spanish.
Twenty-two right-handed native Spanish readers, (18
women, 4 men of average age 19.8 years) participated
voluntarily. One subject was excluded because of her
error rate (> 15%). Overall error rate was below 10% for
each accepted subject. Non-responses and errors were
replaced in each cell by the calculated cross-average for
their corresponding conditions.

Results and Discussion
RTs. A Family Size (FS) effect reaches significance in
both ANOVAs, for subjects (F1(1,21)=1251.30,
MSe=6312.66, p<.01 (High FS: 585ms; Low FS: 613ms)
and for items (F2(1,16)=5.409, MSe=1070.511, p<.05). A
Lexical Status (LS) main effect also reaches significance
(Word (W): 599ms; Pseudoword (PW): 729ms) in both
ANOVAs, for items (F2(1,33)=228.75, MSe=2305.33,
p<.001) and for subjects (F1(1,21)=85.07, MSe=4385.90,
p<.001).
ERPs. An early Lexical Status effect becomes significant
in the 70ms after-stimulus-onset window, a difference that
emerges between Words (-2.56) and Pseudowords (-1.47),
(F(1,10)= 12.416, MSe=1.054, p<.01). Lexical Status
effects are associated with differences between Words
and Pseudowords involving frontal (p<.01) occipital
(p<.05) and parietal (p<.05) sites (Bonferroni pair
comparisons: F(1,10)=2.579, MSe=3.007). A significant
Hemisphere × Lexical Status interaction is observed in
the 200ms after-stimulus-onset window (F(1,10)=23.846,
MSe= 2.429, p<.001; for Left Hemisphere, Word: 0.511;
Pseudowords: 1.424; for Right Hemisphere, Word: 1.467;
Pseudoword: 0.085). In the ANOVA conducted in the
300ms peak interval on mean voltages, a significant
Lexical Status main effect emerges (Word: 1.094;
Pseudoword: 2.167; F(1,10)=5.886, MSe=2.151, p<.05).
ANOVAs conducted in the 300ms and 400ms peak
intervals on mean voltage amplitudes show significant
main Family Size effects for both LH and RH (300ms:
F(1,10)=7.711,
MSe=8.558,
p<.05;
400ms:
F(1,10)=7.618, MSe=3.990, p<.05). These results are
shown in Table 2.

A set of 68 stimuli, 34 monomorphemic words and 34
pseudowords, is used in this experiment. All words were
selected from LEXESP (Sebastián, Cuetos, Martí &
Carreiras, 2000). Following Schreuder and Baayen

It is rather difficult to attribute these ERP to an
underlying component evaluating a word string according
to its morphological composition. In fact, we can clearly
see from these results that amplitudes are different for the

2993

two Family Size conditions at a late stage of processing.
This difference is fully congruent with Schreuder and
Baayen's (1995, 1997) predictions. Their model suggests
that FS facilitation is due to the propagation of semantic
activation among target word family members. Proposing
that the Family Size effect is driven by semantic
evaluation of word strings after lexical access is therefore
also totally in line with their model.

Experiment II: Stem priming
In this second experiment, priming effects of word stems
on word recognition are explored. A 2 (Lexical Status:
Word vs. Pseudoword) ×2 (Stem Family Size (S-FS):
High vs. Low) factorial design was used. Morpheme
Family Size (M-FS), Frequency (F), Neighborhood
Density (ND), Syllable Length (SL) and Letter-string
Length (LL) were also controlled. Table 3 shows the
descriptive statistics of the variables controlled.

Size inhibits the lexical decision process, contrary to
Schreuder & Baayen's (1997) predictions.
ERPs. ANOVAs conducted on mean voltage amplitudes
in the 70, 100, 200, 300 and 400ms peak intervals show
significant differences according to Lexical Status, for
70ms after stimulus onset F(1,10)=14.454, MSe=3.691,
p< .005, for 100ms after stimulus onset, F(1,10)=11.191,
MSe=4.327, p<.01; for 200ms, F(1,10)=5.064,
MSe=8.647, p<.05, for 300ms F(1,10)=18.079,
MSe=5.204, p<.005, and for 400ms F(1,10)=19.763,
MSe=8.978, p<.001. Mean voltage amplitudes for each
window are displayed in Table 4. These results replicate
the main Lexical Status effect observed from behavioral
measures.

Frequency per million words. Standard Deviation in brackets

A set of 72 low-frequency word patterns, 18 words and 18
pseudowords per Family Size condition, were used. Each
word is selected from LEXESP (Sebastián, Cuetos, Martí
& Carreiras, 2000), and comprises a legal combination of
root and suffix (e.g. allerg-ic). Each pseudoword is a noninterpretable combination of a legal root and a legal
suffix, such as allerg-ible. Every stimulus in this set was
randomly presented twice. A postmasked prime,
consisting of the stem of the target word or pseudoword,
was presented for 70ms. The prime is masked for 30ms.
Thirteen right-handed native Spanish readers, (10
women, 3 men of average age 23.2 years) participated
voluntarily. Two subjects were excluded because of their
error rate (> 10%). Overall error rate was below 10% for
every accepted subject. Non-responses and errors were
replaced in each cell by the calculated cross-average for
their corresponding conditions.
Results and Discussion
RTs. Main effects of Lexical Status emerge in the
ANOVAs conducted for subjects (F1(1,19)= 47.65,
MSe=3729.73, p<.001 (W: 655ms vs PW: 749ms)) and
for items (F2(1,35)=85.95, MSe= 3177.71, p<.001 (W:
656ms vs PW: 743ms)). A main Family Size (FS) effect
was found to be significant in the ANOVAs for subjects
(F1(1,19)=13.1, MSe=523.88, p<.002; High FS: 711ms
vs. Low FS: 693ms), but marginally non-significant in the
ANOVAs for items (F2(1,35)= 3.41, MSe=2995.03,
p<.07 High FS: 708ms vs. Low FS: 691ms). The Lexical
Status × Family Size interaction is significant
(F1(1,19)=9.81, MSe=3228.7, p<.005), (F2(1,35)=11.82,
MSe= 11056.67, p<.005). This data shows high Family

The first sign of a main Family Size effect is observed
200ms after stimulus onset (F(1,10)=14.031, MSe=.544,
p<.005) with differences in mean amplitudes between
High and Low Family Size much larger for the Right than
for the Left Hemisphere, and in opposite directions. Table
5 shows these results. The magnitude of this effect varies
across brain areas (F(1,10)=41.549, MSe=9.480, p<.001).
Two other Family Size effects emerge in interaction with
Lexical Status, 100ms (F(1,10)=4.517, MSe=2.053,
p<.05) and 300ms after stimulus onset (F(1,10)=6.376,
MSe= 5.501, p<.05). The results are shown in Table 6.
Brain activity maps in Figures 1 and 2 show different
effects for Low and High Stem Family Size Words at late
processing stages.
The behavioral results reveal an inverse FS effect, a
lower FS leading to shorter response times. As Table 3
shows, in Spanish the number of derivative morphemes

2994

that can be paired with a given lexeme is very low. Once
the prime is presented, the system pre-activates
morphemes that can be concatenated with this lexeme
(Longtin and Meunier, 2005), and they compete with one
another for eventual selection.

was used, words again being selected from the LEXESP
corpus. Each stimulus in this set was randomly presented
twice. The stimuli were constructed in the same way as in
the second experiment.

As for the EEG results, two important caveats apply.
Firstly, the amplitude measures are taken on the scalp. In
the absence of any particular model of source analysis, it
is difficult to determine how ERP measures translate into
actual processing mechanisms. What we learn from these
effects, however, is that the amplitudes differ for words
and pseudowords made up of the same stems and affixes.
Manipulating Family Size of stem primes has a minor late
effect on lexical decisions in this experiment, secondary
to Lexicality. Contrary to a morphological decomposition
account, Lexicality plays a major role in both behavioral
and brain response measures. Secondly, mean amplitude
peaks are measured for each interval separately by
averaging amplitudes over the peak latency interval (-25,
+25ms) after stimulus onset. Before stimulus onset, the
stem of the to-be-presented complex word string is
presented as a prime for 70ms, followed by 30ms with a
marker. 100ms should therefore be added to each latency
interval, being the time taken to process the stem. The
stem might be a reasonable predictor of lexicality,
obscuring the role of morphological decomposition.

Eighteen right-handed native Spanish readers voluntarily
took part (15 women, 3 men of average age 20.7 years).
No subject had more than a 10% error rate. Nonresponses and errors were replaced in each cell as above.

Results and Discussion
RTs. Significant main effects for Lexical Status
(F1(1,17)=123.202,
MSe=1636.759,
p<.001;
F2(1,49)=230.752,

Morpheme-FS (F1(1,17)=22.581, MSe=242.194, p<.001;
F2(1,49)=9.227, MSe=2292.506, p<.005) are observed in
the ANOVAs conducted on RT; the interaction, however,
does not reach significance. On average, Words took
697ms to process, Pseudowords 805ms. Word and
Pseudoword targets which contain a High Family Size
(FS) morpheme require 21ms less than Word and
Pseudoword targets containing a Low FS morpheme
(740ms vs 761ms). High FS morphemes therefore have a
facilitatory effect on word recognition. This finding
supports Schreuder and Baayen's (1997) predictions.

Experiment III: Morpheme Priming
In this third experiment, legal morphemes were used as
primes for words and pseudowords - in this case nonwords made by combining a root and suffix with
incompatible grammatical categories. A 2 (Lexical Status:
Word vs. Pseudoword) ×2 (Morpheme Family Size (MFS): High vs. Low) factorial design was used. Frequency
(F), Neighborhood Density (ND), Syllable Length (SL)
and Letter-string Length (LL) were controlled. A new
variable was controlled in this experiment: Stem Family
Size (S-FS), the number of stems a particular morpheme
could be paired with. Table 7 shows the descriptive
statistics of the variables controlled.

ERPs. ANOVAs conducted in the 70ms peak interval on
mean voltage amplitudes show a significant main effect
for Lexical Status (F(1,17)=6.64, MSe=0.95, p<.05). This
Lexical Status effect also emerges in the 300ms window
(F(1,17)=3.405, MSe=3.416, p<.05). Interestingly, the
actual effect does not change direction between these
windows. Planned pair comparisons show significant
differences between the two levels of the Lexical Status
conditions, with mean voltage amplitudes significantly
larger for LH than for RH at both intervals (70, 300),
when whole-word models are accessed and when
incoming word cues are to be integrated. The relevant
results are shown in Table 8. As for Morpheme Family
Size, clearly significant effects emerge at 70ms
(F(1,17)=6.64, MSe=.95, p<.001) and at 100ms
(F(1,17)=5.64, MSe=.984, p<.001). At this early stage, a
double Lexical Status × Morpheme-FS interaction reaches
significance (F(1,17)= 3.387, MSe=2.777, p<.005, with
mean voltage amplitudes for words (2.29µv) larger than
for pseudowords (1.25µv). Brain activity maps for both
Low and High Morpheme-Family Size for Words are
displayed in Figures 3 and 4. No other effects are
significant. In order to correctly interpret these effects, as
in the second experiment, the role of the prime must be
taken into account: morphemes are available 70 ms before
the entire word pattern. Nonetheless, an early Lexical
Status effect is found under these conditions. As expected,
in this third experiment there is no sign of an inhibitory
FS effect from the behavioral analysis.

General Discussion
In this study we first replicated Family Size effects
obtained by Schreuder and Baayen (1997). Behavioral
results show that low FS words are recognized later than
high FS words. The combined behavioral and EEG data
show that larger FS facilitates access to the word itself
(Carlisle & Katz, 2006). In addition, the EEG results
show late semantic effects associated with the FS
variable, as observed by Lehtonen, Cunillera, RodríguezFornells, Hultén, Tuomainen & Laine (2007). High
Family Size produced facilitatory effects on
monomorphemic words at the stage where incoming cues
are integrated into whole-word representations. The role
of the morphological structure of words and pseudwords
was then explored in two additional masked priming
experiments. In the second experiment, the effect of
priming with actual roots is compared for words and
pseudowords. In the third experiment, we turned to word
recognition primed by existing morphemes. Behavioral

data from the second experiment does not support
Schreuder and Baayen’s predictions: a High Family Size
root has an inhibitory role in lexical decision. This inverse
FS effect has been noted previously, for example by Taft
et al. (2004) with his inflectional morphology. His results
are explained in similar terms to those of Meunier &
Segui (1999), who propose that suffixed words belonging
to the same morphological family are organized around a
shared lexical entry, and must therefore compete with one
another for activation. In other words a morphological
process occurs, where competition is based on the
frequency of concatenation of morphemes with their
lexemes. This competitive process did not occur in the
third experiment, although in theory this solution could
also apply here. The reason for lexical competition being
observed in the second experiment but not in the third lies
in the linguistic properties of the prime and of the
different morphological elements in play. Whilst in the
second experiment the prime was the lexeme of the target
stimulus, in the third it was the derivative morpheme.
According to Meunier & Longtin (2007), the use of
morphological primes can pre-activate associated entries,
and so lexemes and morphemes may prime for different
information, depending on their linguistic properties. In
tables 3 and 7 we can see how morpheme and lexeme FS
varies greatly. In the case of lexemes, the mean number of
candidates does not rise above ten, while the number of
lexemes that can be paired with a morpheme is over a
thousand. Thus if our prime is useful, and pre-activates a
limited set of candidates (as in the second experiment) we
can defend the idea that a lexical competition process is
under way. If, on the other hand, our prime preactivates
hundreds or even thousands of candidates (as in the
experiment three) it provides negligible information of
use to us, and there is no possibility of competitive
processing taking place. Lexical competition is viable
where the number of candidates pre-activated is small
enough to make this process an efficient task, which only
occurs if the lexeme prime is used. As for the Lexical
Status variable, in experiment two and three we can see
robust, significant lexical status effects - early (also
observed by Hauk, Pulvermüller, Ford, Marslen-Wilson, &
Davis, 2009, and Segalowit & Zheng, 2009) as well as
late. In our opinion, this late effect marks the lexical
decision itself. One decisive factor on the results of this
experiment was the use of words and pseudowords in
which the concatenation of lexemes and morphemes
formed plausible words which in some cases actually
existed
(words) and in others did not (pseudowords). The system
must therefore make a lexical decision not based on FS,
but rather on the compatibility of the morphemes
expressed. This situation forces an exhaustive analysis of
morpheme compatibility, which is expressed in the
frequency of concatenation of the stimuli. If the
concatenation has a frequency higher than 0, the stimulus
is a real word. Family Size effects are dependent on
lexicality and frequency. In the third experiment, the
apparent early Family Size effect might be an artifact of
masked priming (Longtin & Meunier, 2007), but there is
evidence to suggest that morphological decomposition
does concur with LH lexical activation as we would

2996

expect. Morphologically complex words can be directly
accessed only when their whole-word representations are
activated and their morphemes are too.
Morpheme Family Size plays a major role in the word
recognition process, but morpheme availability depends
on whole-word activation, as revealed in the second and
third experiments by the role of Lexical Status and its
interaction with Morpheme Family Size. The facilitative
and inhibitory effects obtained can be attributed to
intralexical mechanisms. In contrast with the stem, a
morpheme cannot generally make a truly independent
contribution to the lexical status of a word candidate. In
our opinion the lexeme clearly guides word recognition
(Lehtonen et al., 2007).
The results obtained in the three experiments sit easily
within a lexical model that conceives lexemes as partially
independent lexical units, but their computation depends
on the Lexical Status of the whole-word pattern. It is a
fact that morphemes are not learnt independently of the
lexical entries they form part of.
