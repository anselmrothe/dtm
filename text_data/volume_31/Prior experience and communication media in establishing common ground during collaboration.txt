                   Experiment paradigm
In our study, we use an experimental paradigm designed by
Hayashi et al. (2006). In this paradigm, two participants en-
gage in a rule discovery task, and each of them engages in
the task with a different perspective. While solving the task,
each of the participants confronts miscommunication about
the other’s perspective and has to manage to overcome this                           Figure 2: Experimental situation

Controlling the participants’ perspective
We controlled the degree of tendency of focusing on each of
two different colored surfaces as an experimental stimulus to
manipulate the participants’ perspectives based on the Gestalt
psychological principles (Koffka, 1935). As shown in Figure
1, we constructed stimuli where white and black unit squares
are randomly arranged on a six × six grid.                                        Figure 3: Series of presented stimuli
