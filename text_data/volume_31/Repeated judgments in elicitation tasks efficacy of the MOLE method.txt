thereby avoiding the possibility of the elicitee simply
repeating their answers. Also, by randomly selecting values
from across the parameter space, it ensures that the elicitee
is forced to consider new values rather than focusing on
their initial value. The MOLE method has been shown to
provide superior estimates to basic, single judgment
elicitation techniques in terms of both accuracy and
calibration (Welsh, et al., 2008).
