Figure 4: (a) Two sample distributions from Experiment 2 are shown at the top, with the performance of the three models shown below. For
each model, the best parameter settings for just Experiment 2 and the best parameter settings for all the distributions of both experiments are
compared. The best RH-R and CLUS models are very similar for overall results vs. for just the Experiment 2 distributions. The best RH-SD
model overall, however, is very different from the best RH-SD model for just the Expt 2 distributions – so much so that the best overall model
does not capture adult judgments for the Experiment 2 distributions well at all. (b) The best Experiment 2 RH-R and CLUS models also
perform very well overall, but that is not the case for the best Experiment 2 RH-SD model. The histograms show the mean differences for the
best Experiment 2 models across all distributions from Experiments 1 and 2.
