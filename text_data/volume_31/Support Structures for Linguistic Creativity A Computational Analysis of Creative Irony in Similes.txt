like the presence of “about” – can encourage an audience to
collude with the author in constructing a humorous interpre-

way, though it does seem to be one of the simplest and most
direct, at least for similes. Further investigation is needed to
see whether other linguistic markers of equal utility can be
identified, both for predicting creative intent and for automat-
