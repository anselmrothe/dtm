Abstract: Although many developmental processes that involve perceiving and producing a certain phenomenon are
characterized by correct perception before correct production, this does not hold as general law. A prime example can
be found in language development, as young children are able to distinguish between different forms in production,
but not in perception. For example, children of 4;7 years of age are able to correct differentiate between himself
and him when talking about a picture describing either an agent hitting himself, or hitting another agent. However,
they are not able to select which picture correctly describes the penguin hits himself or the penguin hits him (Van
Rij, Hendriks, Spenader, & Van Rijn, 2009). By constructing computational models of the involved processes and
conducting experiments based on the models predictions we have shown that this asynchrony could be due to too
limited processing resources.
