Abstract
In this work we explore a variant of a classic explore/exploit
dilemma based on a recent study by Shin and Ariely (2004).
We presented participants with a scenario in which they were
forced to explore among 9 different options of unknown value;
for some, options left unexplored long enough disappeared.
Contrary to expectations, the mere presence of additional options did not substantially increase people’s ability to walk
away from them. However, when options differed in value,
people were able to locate the more valuable options and became much more willing to walk away from at least a few. Finally, our analysis of individual differences revealed that while
people differ greatly in the strategies they approach the task
with, almost every participant showed an “explore to exploit”
shift over time.

Introduction
At almost any point in time, the set of possible actions available to a person is extremely large. When ordering lunch at
many sandwich delicatessens, for instance, several different
types of bread, meat, salads and sauces lead to a combinatorial explosion in the number of potential sandwiches. When
applying to a University, high school students have hundreds
of possible institutions and degree structures to consider. In
such situations, people need to select the best course of action from a very large number of possibilities, despite the fact
that they lack the resources (time, effort, and money) to thoroughly investigate all aspects of the domain. As a result, the
learner is faced with a classic “explore-exploit” dilemma: the
value of some of the options is known to them from previous experience, but the value of other possibilities remain unknown. Thus, a higher-level decision is required: what proportion of resources should be allocated to the problem of
searching for good options (exploration), and what proportion to taking advantage of them (exploitation)?
In a recent study, Shin and Ariely (2004) presented people with a limited version of this dilemma, which took the

following form. Participants were presented with a computerized display showing three doors, which could be opened
by clicking the mouse. Once a door was opened, further
clicks yielded rewards sampled randomly from a probability distribution not known to the participants. Each door had
a different distribution of rewards (though, unbeknownst to
participants, the distributions had identical expected values),
so participants needed to investigate the three doors. However, since participants were only allowed a fixed number of
clicks in the experiment, and the opening of one door caused
all other doors to close, engaging in search was a costly behavior. Formally, this is an example of a three-armed bandit
problem with switching costs, a problem that is well studied
in statistics (e.g., Robbins, 1952) and has begun to be studied in the decision-making literature (e.g., Steyvers, Lee, &
Wagenmakers, in press).
A novel innovation in the Shin and Ariely (2004) study was
the fact that, in some conditions, the doors could shrink and
vanish if left unopened for a sufficiently long time, removing
that option for good. This matches the structure of many realworld problems: if one does not study mathematics in high
school, for instance, the option of becoming a mathematician later in life eventually disappears. The results showed
that when an option threatens to vanish, people were willing
to expend resources to keep it viable, even though this is a
mathematically suboptimal strategy for this task.
While switching costs and the threat of vanishing is an interesting extension to the standard multi-armed bandit problem, the experiment in Shin and Ariely (2004) has some
shortcomings in terms of how well it maps onto the situations
faced in real life.
First, in many (probably most) situations in life, people
are faced with more than the three options presented to subjects in the experiment; as the number of options increases, it
becomes increasingly difficult to preserve all possible future
actions. However, given that reward-generating processes in
real life also tend to be nonstationary (e.g., profits in farming
alter as a function of climate), it would be unwise to follow
the optimal “pick one and stick with it” strategy from the original Shin and Ariely (2004) experiment. Are people sensitive
to the total number of options possible, and are they more

conditions, the doors had equivalent expected value, while in the
other two conditions some doors were objectively better choices than
others.

Figure 1: Participants encountered doors to nine rooms, each of
which they could click on to open the door. Once open, clicking again yielded a variable amount of treasure (sampled from that

300 clicks, and moving to new rooms cost them a click. Their goal
was to maximize the treasure gained over the course of the experiment.

willing to “know when to walk away” when there are more
than three available?
Second, in the Shin and Ariely (2004) experiment, participants were presented with doors (options) that were equal
in expected value. In real life, options differ widely in their
value to us: in choosing among future careers, “doctor” is an
option that more people want to preserve than, say, “garbage
collector.” When options differ in value, the mathematically
optimal strategy is no longer to “pick one and stick with it”:
rather, there must be sufficient exploration of all of the options to be able to identify which are the most valuable. Furthermore, it may also be easier to walk away from some of
options when some are clearly better than others.
In this paper we present and analyse an experiment, modelled after the Shin and Ariely (2004) work, but with two
major differences. First, participants were presented with 9
doors (options) rather than 3; and in some conditions, the
doors differed in expected value. Our results suggest that,
contrary to expectations, the mere existence of additional options did not make people more able to walk away from some
of them. However, when options differed in expected value,
they were much more willing to abandon options, and performed quite similar to the conditions in which options did
not vanish with disuse. In general, these results indicate that
people have trouble knowing when to walk away primarily
when the options all appear quite similar. We discuss the implications of this finding.

Experimental Method
The Task
Following the method outlined by Shin and Ariely (2004),
the overall structure of the experiment involved a sequential
search task. In the original experiment, the alternatives were
represented as three doors on a computer screen; in our ex-

periment, there were nine. Each door was associated with
a certain payoff distribution, which participants could claim
by clicking on the door. As in many real-life search tasks,
the search itself was costly; the task was to maximize earnings by spending their limited clicks wisely. Figure 1 shows
a schematic depiction of the experiment as it appeared to our
participants.
In the experiment (implemented in Visual Basic) each participant was presented with nine doors, each of a different,
random, color. Clicking with the mouse on a door (doorclick) allowed participants to open that door and enter the
room; once inside, each click (room-click) would yield a different amount of payoff sampled randomly from that room’s
payoff distribution. It was not possible to claim treasure with
a room-click before the door was open, and upon leaving a
room to click on another, the first door closed automatically.
This was explained to participants by telling them that each
door hid a pile of treasure, which they could claim by first
opening the door, and then clicking on it to grab handfuls of
treasure.
Participants were informed that each door might contain
different amounts of treasure, and that the size of each handful would vary; because some of the payoff distributions
occasionally resulted in negative points, we mentioned that
some doors might occasionally “steal” a participant’s treasure when they reached in. Each person was allocated a total of 300 clicks – three times as many as in the Shin and
Ariely (2004) experiment, since there were three times as
many doors – and told that they would be paid in proportion
to the amount of treasure they gathered. The number of clicks
they had remaining, as well as their total treasure earned, was
displayed prominently over the course of the experiment.

while grey markers plot data from the constant expected value conditions. The panel on the right summarizes the data from all four conditions,
plotting means and 95% confidence intervals.

The Manipulations
There were two main manipulations to this experiment. First,
as in Shin and Ariely (2004), we varied the availability of the
doors. In the CONSTANT AVAILABILITY condition, the doors
did not disappear if they were not clicked on occasionally.
In the DECREASING AVAILABILITY condition, the doors decreased in size with every click that was not on them, and disappeared altogether after 15 clicks; once a door disappeared,
it was forevermore inaccessible. If a door was clicked on before disappearing entirely, it was immediately restored to its
full size, and the process began again.
The second manipulation was to vary the distribution of the
expected value of the payoffs assigned to individual doors.
In three of the four original Shin and Ariely (2004) experiments, all of the doors always had the same expected payoff,
although they varied in the variance and nature of the distribution (some were Normal distributions, and some were ChiSquares).1 In our experiment, in the CONSTANT EXPECTED
VALUE condition, all of the doors had an expected value of 3
points per click, although (as before) they varied in the variance and nature of the distribution). By contrast, in the VARI ABLE EXPECTED VALUE condition, three of the doors had
an expected value of 1 point per click, three had an expected
value of 3 points per click, and three had an expected value
of 5 points per click. Participants were given the same instructions regardless of condition, and received no indication
of which doors had higher expected value. Table 1 shows the
distribution of payments in the nine doors across the different conditions. Conditions were crossed in a 2x2 factorial
design: we denote the conditions as CA-CE (constant availability, constant expected value), CA-VE (constant availabil1 In the fourth, the payoffs were different, but only slightly - ranging from 2.5 points to 3.5 points per door.

ity, variable expected value), DA-CE (decreasing availability,
constant expected value) and DA-VE (decreasing availability, variable expected value).

The Participants
Thirty-two participants (7 male) aged 19-54, 8 in each condition, were recruited from a paid participant pool largely
consisting of undergraduate psychology students and their acquaintances. The experiment took place as part of a series of
three unrelated studies, which took approximately 1 hour to
complete. Payment varied as a function of performance on
this task, but averaged $12 each across the hour. This experiment took approximately 15-20 minutes.

Results
Overview
To give a broad overview of the data, Figure 2 plots the total number of door switches made by each participant against
the average reward received per click. In the panels on the
left and middle, each marker corresponds to a participant,
and the type of marker indicates which experimental condition was involved. As one might expect, participants who
switched frequently tended to have much poorer returns-perclick. However, as is also clear from the aggregate plots
shown in the right-hand panel, there are some significant differences between conditions. In agreement with the general
pattern of results presented by Shin and Ariely (2004), the decreasing availability conditions (squares) tended to produce
more door-switching behavior than their corresponding constant availability conditions (circles). However, as predicted,
the variable expected-value conditions tended to decrease the
door switching behavior by a similar amount. Finally, as predicted, people were able to explore the rooms in such a way as

to find good doors and ignore bad ones: the variable expected
value conditions involve higher rates of return.

Learning & Option Trimming
How did people’s behavior change as the experiment progressed? We calculate the average number of door switches
during each block of 10 clicks over the course of the 300-click
experiment, as shown in Figure 3. Several patterns emerge.
In all of the conditions, the average number of door
switches decreases over the course of the experiment. This
is a replication of a result by Shin and Ariely (2004), and is
quite sensible, since it reflects the change in the nature of the
explore/exploit tradeoff as the experiment progresses. At the
beginning of the experiment, participants have little to no information about the nature of the payoff distributions of each
door, and thus it is more in their interest to explore each of
the doors, rather than to exploit the ones they know. As the
experiment progresses, the expected benefit to exploring decreases (since the experiment will end after 300 clicks), and
the need for exploring also decreases (since the participants
already have some information about the payment distributions of the doors).
Despite this general trend, participants in the DA-CE condition showed little decrease in the amount of door switching
per block, especially relative to participants in the other conditions. Even in the final block, when keeping options open
is no longer even remotely sensible, participants switched on
average four times – nearly three times as many as the participants in the Shin and Ariely (2004) experiment, and approx-

Figure 4: Average number of doors that remain viable at the end of
the experiment, for the decreasing availability conditions (squares).
For comparative purposes, an analogous measure is shown for the
constant availability conditions (circles), which counts the number
of unique doors clicked in the final 15 trials. Error bars depict 95%
confidence intervals. Note that the variable EV conditions result in
fewer doors being kept viable, since participants are generally able
to detect bad options.

imately twice as many times as the participants in our other
conditions. This result came as a surprise because we had
hypothesized that if the number of options was increased significantly beyond three, they would be more willing to walk
away from at least a few of them. However, switching nearly
three times as often is what one would expect if there were
three times as many options and one’s willingness to walk
away was almost the same. Thus, contrary to expectation, the
number of options per se did not substantially affect participants’ willingness to let some options go.
The variable expected-value environments pose an
explore-exploit dilemma for participants because discovering
good options requires engaging in some door-switching behavior. By contrast, within the constant expected-value environments – as in the Shin and Ariely (2004) experiments –
all options are equally good. However, the participants have
no way of knowing which kind of environment they are in a
priori. Decreasing availability sharpens this problem considerably, since participants must engage in a lot of effort to preserve the ability to explore. Figure 3 shows that differences
in the expected value of the distributions of the doors makes
a difference in behavior. As we have seen, participants in the
DA-CE condition continued to switch relatively often, but
those in the DA-VE condition switched much more. In fact,
even when availability is constant, variable expected value
conditions switched less often than when all of the doors were
equally valuable. Figure 4 shows this as well: people tended
to keep 1 to 3 options in the variable expected value condi-

1261

tions and 4 to 6 in the constant expected value condition. To
facilitate comparison, we also plot the analogous measure for
the constant availability conditions: the number of different
doors clicked on in the last 15 trials of the experiment.

Individual Differences
At this stage, we have evidence to suggest that the basic effects discussed by Shin and Ariely (2004) replicate: people
do work to preserve their exploration options, and are willing
to take financial losses to do so. That being said, it is clear
that in general people do not attempt to preserve all options,
with few people keeping more than half of the doors viable.
Moreover, we generalize the findings to show that people use
this exploration ability to improve their choices in inhomogeneous environments, and show strong signs of learning during the process. However, one extremely important issue that
remains unexplored is the matter of individual differences,
since it is well-known (e.g. Estes, 1956) that aggregate measures can sometimes be highly misleading in the presence of
individual variation.
With that in mind, Figures 5–8 attempt to provide an explicit representation of the entire raw data set. Each of these
figures displays the data from one of the four experimental
conditions, with each participant’s data corresponding to one
panel. The way data are displayed in each panel is as follows:
the horizontal axis corresponds to trial number (running from
1 to 300), and the vertical axis corresponds to door number
(running from 1 to 9). Doors with higher expected value are
plotted at the top of the figure; if two doors have the same
expected value, the higher variance one is plotted above; and
doors with identical distributions are plotted in a random order. Each black segment corresponds to a door click – so if
the first door clicked on was the best one, there is a slim black
line in the top left corner of the plot. If a participant clicked
on the same door on all 300 trials, the panel would show a
single black strip. In contrast, if they switched between all 9
doors very frequently, the display would look like a chaotic
scatterplot.
Inspection of these figures illustrates that there are very
strong individual differences in this task, and moreover that
averaged performance measures act to hide the fundamental strategies that people follow in solving the task. Broadly
speaking, almost every participant shows an “explore to exploit” shift over time regardless of experimental conditions,
with a gradual winnowing of the doors chosen. Given that a
large part of the task involves an information search process
– learning which doors are good, which are bad, and which
ones are equivalent, this general pattern is anything but irrational: how else can a learner discover good options except
by exploring (switching doors)?
The interesting variation across people regards the rate of
the switch from exploration to exploitation patterns. In the
constant availability/constant EV condition (Figure 5) there
is a stark difference between two groups of people. Six of the
eight participants hone in on an option easily, while two continue to explore for the entire 300 trials. For the constant

availability/variable EV condition (Figure 6) seven participants find one good option, though in one case a low-level
exploration continues through the experiment.
Turning to the two decreasing availability conditions, the
same general strategies seem to be in play, but with the added
complication that people are required to switch more frequently in order to preserve the ability to explore. In the
decreasing availability/constant EV condition, this is particularly problematic for people, since there is in fact no useful structure to uncover, but it is not easily searchable due to
the enforced switching during search. As a result, the various response patterns displayed in Figure 7 do show a slow
trimming of options, but most participants are not able to
complete the process during the allotted time. In contrast, in
the decreasing availability/variable EV condition (Figure 8),
there is a genuine structure to be discovered, and so even in
spite of the enforced switching, all participants are able to
sensibly trim the options; in doing so, there is a strong bias to
trim the bad ones. Most of the black marks migrate to the top
of the panels across trials.

Conclusion
As in Shin and Ariely (2004), we found that people paid certain costs in order to keep options open, even when there were
many more options (nine rather than three). However, our results support a more subtle and interesting explanation of this
behavior, because they show that people were far less willing
to keep many options open when some were clearly better
than others. This suggests that the “keeping options open”
problem is acute only when the situation is structured so that
it is difficult to explore sufficiently thoroughly to tell them
apart. Finally, an analysis of individual differences indicates
substantial variety in the strategies people use; it is not the
case that everyone opts for irrational strategies, even in the
most irrationality-inducing of situations.
