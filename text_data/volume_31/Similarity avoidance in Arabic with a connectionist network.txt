Abstract: This project accounts for the facts of similarity avoidance in Arabic consonant phonology in a connec-
tionist network. The network is a feedforward network with two hidden layers. Input units encode the phonological
feature representations of triliteral roots, and input activations spread through hidden layers to the output layer
consisting of a single unit, whose activation represents the acceptibility of a form. Portions of the network are
trained using standard backpropagation learning, whereas others portions are trained separately on different tasks
and then incorporated into the larger network. The result is a network that evaluates the acceptibility of novel forms
based largely on similarity avoidance. The proposed model differs from recent Harmonic Grammar accounts (Coetzee
& Pater 2008) in that it does not require the prior existence of linguistic constraints. Finally, as a connectionist
network, the model captures a cross-linguistically robust fact of phonological systems with neurologically plausible
assumptions.
