about the properties associated with each category.
   Sakamoto and Love (2006) have shown that classification
learners display little knowledge about properties other than
the property that is most useful in distinguishing members
from different categories. On the other hand, inference
learners acquired information about multiple properties that
are queried during training, and this knowledge was retained
after multiple day delays. Thus, querying played a critical
role in the retention of knowledge by inference learners.
However, it is unclear whether explicit querying is
beneficial because it guides people’s attention to the queried
properties or because answering questions consolidates
memory. These questions are addressed in the current
experiment.
   Although many studies have now examined inference

Test Following the filler phase, the participants completed a
test phase, in which their knowledge about the properties of
the two shark categories from training was measured. The
test phase consisted of a sequential presentation of 20 text
questions, once in a random order, resulting in 20 trials. Ten
forced-choice questions tested each of the 5 dimensions for
the two categories. For example, the text “Tiger sharks:”
was presented above the two choices “A: tend to be smaller”
and “B: tend to be larger” when the size dimension of the
Tiger shark was questioned. Another set of 10 questions was
created in the opposite fashion. For instance, the text “tend
to be larger:” was displayed above the choices “A: Tiger
sharks” and “B: Sixgill sharks” when the shark associated
with the larger size was questioned. The correct (i.e.,
category-typical) and foil choices were randomly assigned
to the top (A) or bottom (B) position on each trial.
Participants pressed the A or B key to indicate choice A or
B is correct, respectively. No corrective feedback was given
to participants to prevent learning during the test phase.
