Abstract: When two people join together to perform a task, they must often develop a means to coordinate their
activity, taking into account the environmental circumstances (physical and social) that constrain their ability to
achieve the joint task. This ability may call for the perception of joint affordances, or opportunities for group
action. In this investigation, we examined individuals ability to perceive joint affordances for a simple action walking
through an aperture side-by-side with another person, without rotating the shoulders. Experiment 1 indicated the
joint affordance for dyads performing this task was not equivalent to the sum of the individuals separate affordances
when walking through alone. Experiment 2 suggested individuals were able to perceive the joint affordance for this
task, exhibiting sensitivity to the non-additive nature of the joint affordance. The results suggest that individuals
can perceive affordances for joint (dyadic) action.
