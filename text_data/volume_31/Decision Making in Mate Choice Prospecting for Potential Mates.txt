          Here we present new findings that extend this
research. Cross-cultural data replicating our 2009 study with
both German and Chinese participants allows us to see if
language comprehension increases performance, and if less
exposure to Western culture decreases performance.
Additionally, new eye-tracking data demonstrates patterns
of differential attentional deployment during this
observational task. Our unique stimuli set of videos of
actual mate choice interactions allows us to ask questions
and design experiments that have previously been
unavailable to researchers, such as whether highly accurate
observers attend more to the non-verbal cues presented by
