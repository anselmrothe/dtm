   As in Ramscar & Yarlett (2007) the likelihood of
over-regularization (i.e. failure to produce the learned
response) was modeled as a result of response
competition, caused by spreading activation to items in
memory that are activated by the semantics of the
situation but which correspond to different
phonological forms. This activation is modeled as a                    Figure 4. Response propensity levels over training. Over-

Participants
   24 four and 23 six year old children living resident in
the vicinity of Palo Alto, California, and recruited from
a database of volunteers. The average ages were 4 years
and 7 months for the four year olds, and 6 years and 7
months for the six year olds.
Methods and materials
   The children were randomly assigned to two groups,
both of which were pre-tested on plural production.3 In
the elicitation test the children were asked to help a
cookie monster puppet learn to name a series of six
irregular nouns, and six regular pairings of plural
nouns. The children sat with the experimenter and
named the nouns first from singular and then from
plural depictions that were presented on a laptop                   Figure 5. Pre and post test performance by age and condition
