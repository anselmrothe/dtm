                               Abstract
    In the absence of sufficient cognitive stimulation, intelligence
    — and with it, a capacity for learning new things — tends
    to degrade with age. In this paper I explore a novel hypoth-
    esis: that this may be an adaptive solution, since learning is
    facilitated by temporarily inhibiting action selection and thus
    introducing temporal delays. An older animal that is not be-
    ing cognitively challenged may be in a sufficiently stable en-
    vironment that reducing the delay before action at the cost of
    also reducing learning capacity may be a sensible tradeoff. I
    support parts of this model by matching a simulation of it to
    known reaction-time results, and by providing an account for
    previously unexplained task-learning results in adult and aged
    macaques
