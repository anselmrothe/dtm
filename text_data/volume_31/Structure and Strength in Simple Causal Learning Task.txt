Abstract: Causal learning enables us to explain past events, control present events, and predict future events. To
figure out causal structure and its strength, people use various cues such as covariaton, temporal order, intervention,
and prior knowledge (Lagnado, Waldmann, Hagmayer, & Sloman, 2006). In 2 studies, the authors investigated the
influence of temporal order on causal inference and examined the relation between structure judgment and strength
judgment. In Study 1, people are capable of deriving correct predictive inference and diagnostic inference. In Study
2, majority of participants can infer correct causal structure for a simple causal learning task
