phenomena (Steels, 2004; van Trijp, 2008), but unfortunately,
there is no large database yet of lexical and grammatical con-
structions for natural language processing.
Motivation (and gains)
From the above two subsections, it is clear that FrameNet is
in need of a computational formalism for testing its frame an-
notations in actual language processing, and that FCG could
use a large linguistic inventory for broadening its scope of
application. The two, therefore, seem to be a perfect fit, es-
pecially given the fact that FCG uses feature structures for
representing linguistic knowledge, which is highly compati-
ble with how semantics is encoded in the FrameNet database.
Our aim in this paper is therefore to show how the combina-
tion of both offers linguists a very valuable tool for exploring
theoretical issues and challenges in applied linguistics that re-     Figure 1: Annotation of the example sentence with the frames

   We strongly believe that the formalization of Frame Se-
mantics and Construction Grammar in concrete models, in
concord with empirical data from various subfields of cogni-
tive linguistics, will open up interesting research avenues in
the future and allow for a deeper understanding of linguistic
processing and human cognition.
