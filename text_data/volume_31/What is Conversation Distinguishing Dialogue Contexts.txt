Accessibility of the Antecedent
What these examples make clear is that the accessibility of
an antecedent is not a simple function of time elapsed, turns
elapsed, nor recency in memory. They suggest rather, that
people track different conversational contexts that may be
maintained in parallel over surprisingly long periods espe-
cially in discontinuous strands of interaction where there is
an ‘open state of talk’ (Goffman, 1981). An initial general-
isation suggested by these examples is that distinct dialogue
contexts may be distinguished in terms of the set of primary
participants, i.e. those actively making contributions (jointly
or individually). This leads to the prediction that an ellipti-
                                                                                        Figure 1: Director 1’s view
cal turn that is separated from its antecedent by a different
dialogue context, i.e. when there’s been a change in primary
participants, should be more easily resolved than one which
is separated by the same number of turns from the same dia-
logue context.
   In this paper we report an experimental test of this predic-
tion by looking at the relative ease with which participants
are able to resolve elliptical clarification questions within or
across dialogue contexts.
