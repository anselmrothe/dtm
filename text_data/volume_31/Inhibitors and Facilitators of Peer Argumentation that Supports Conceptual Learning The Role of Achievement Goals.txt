Abstract
Recent research suggests that peer-to-peer argumentation
supports conceptual change in students’ knowledge structures
in science and mathematics, provided that students actually
juxtapose and evaluate different ideas in a critical, yet coconstructive manner. However, it is well known that this type
of peer-to-peer dialogue is not easily elicited and sustained,
especially on scientific topics. In this paper, we report on
findings from research that investigates how the pursuing of
different goals may result in more or less productive types of
peer interaction and peer argumentation, and how this, in turn
affects conceptual learning from these interactions. In study 1,
we focused on the relation between students’ individual
achievement goal orientations and four different types of peer
interaction behavior, with the help of self-report
questionnaires. In study 2, the effect of different interaction
goal instructions (co-constructive vs. competitive) is tested on
peer dialogue and on subsequent individual learning gains.
Keywords: argumentation, dialogue, conceptual change, peer
interaction, achievement goal orientations.

The term "conceptual change" refers to a specific form of
learning that requires the transformation of misconceived,
intuitive knowledge to correct scientific knowledge (Chi,
2008). The literature has extensively shown that many
misconceptions are often very adaptive in everyday life,
compatible with everyday experience and sustained by
ambiguous language use. These misconceptions are,
therefore, difficult to uproot even with traditional show-andtell teaching techniques. So as to induce conceptual change,
specifically designed learning activities are required, many
of which are based on the Piagetian notion of creating
cognitive conflict (Piaget, 1985). However, several recent
studies have shown that merely confronting students with
contradictory data or pairing them with a disagreeing peer is
not sufficient by itself and that engagement in peer
argumentation is an important condition for achieving
conceptual gains within such settings (Asterhan & Schwarz,
2007; Nussbaum & Sinatra, 2003; Schwarz, Neuman &
Biezuner, 2000). Recent findings from detailed peer-to-peer
protocols show that it is the dialectical, critical consideration
of different ideas that produces substantive conceptual gains
(Asterhan & Schwarz, 2009a). Consensual moves of
explanation and elaboration, on the other hand, were not
found to predict conceptual change following peer dialogue.
Thus, students should actively and explicitly confront and
criticize different explanations to gain from peer dialogue.
However, it is well known that such dialectical peer-topeer argumentation is not easily elicited when it comes to

discussing scientific topics (e.g., deVries, Lund & Baker,
2001; Hausmann, 2005; Nonnon, 1995). Moreover, in-depth
analyses of student dialogues have also shown that
competitive, debate-like dialecticism was not followed by
conceptual change. The dialectical argumentation of gaining
dyads, on the other hand, was characterized by a pleasant
and constructive, yet critical atmosphere (co-constructive
critical argumentation) (Asterhan & Schwarz, 2009b).
Although not identical, these distinctions are reminiscent of
Doise and Mugny’s (1984) distinction between
epistemically vs. relationally regulated socio-cognitive
conflict.
Even though individual cognitive skills definitely play a
role in peer argumentation (Kuhn, 1991; Means & Voss,
1996), these findings strongly suggest that we should not
only confine the study of argumentation and of learning
from peer argumentation to the realm of cognitive skills. In
addition, we should also consider the role of psychosocial
factors as inhibitors or facilitators of the type of peer
dialogue that may support or suppress learning within sociocognitive conflict settings. Previous research has focused on
the role of an individual’s need for cognition,
epistemological beliefs and extraverted personality traits on
their willingness to engage in argumentation (Nussbaum 7
Bendixen, 2003). In this paper, we focus on achievement
goal orientations (e.g., Ames & Archer, 1988; Butler, 2000),
that is: the goals students pursue when they perform an
achievement task, and their relation with different types of
peer dialogue when these are required to engage in a critical
discussion on a learning topic.
In spite of the extensive literature on achievement goals,
its role in peer collaboration has been largely unexplored.
Some first attempts have been undertaken by social
psychologists: For example, Levy, Kaplan and Patrick
(2004) have explored the relations between achievement
goals, social status and students' preferences and willingness
to cooperate with peers from different social groups. In a
recent set of experimental studies by Darnon and colleagues
(Darnon, Buchs & Butera, 2002; Darnon, Muller, Schrager,
Panuzzo, & Butera, 2006; Darnon, Butera & Harackiewicz,
2007) individual learners were confronted with a fictitious
partner that proposed a different solution from theirs. It was
shown that achievement goals predicted learning gains from
short computer-mediated communication with this fictitious
partner: Whereas mastery goals (a focus on learning and
personal improvement) positively related with learning
gains, ability goals (a focus on individual ability

1633

comparisons) did not. Thus far, however, these effects have
yet to be tested within settings that target learning that
involves conceptual change. Moreover, peer collaboration
behavior was not directly assessed in these studies, even
though it is believed to mediate the effect of goal
orientations on learning gains from socio-cognitive conflict.
Finally, Darnon and colleagues did not distinguish between
the two different types of ability goals that have been
observed in the motivation literature: Ability-approach
goals, that orient towards showing one's competence and
superior performance, and ability-avoidance goals, that
orient towards avoidance of showing low performance and
receiving negative judgments (Elliott & Church, 1997;
Elliott & Harackiewicz, 1996). These two types of ability
goal have been shown to lead to distinctively different
learning behaviors in individual learning settings (e.g.,
Elliot & Church, 1997).

Research questions
In the present study we aim to investigate the relation
between achievement goal orientations and peer
collaboration behaviors in socio-cognitive task settings that
have been suggested to inhibit or to foster conceptual
change. Since mastery involvement orients towards
improving understanding and preference for challenging
tasks (see for example Butler, 2000, for an overview) it is
expected to be positively related with behavioral measures
of co-constructive, critical argumentation. Ability goals that
orient students to strive to demonstrate superior ability
(ability-approach), on the other hand, are expected to be
positively related with measures of competitive debating,
whereas ability goals that orient students to mask inferior
ability (ability-avoidance) will lead students to engage in
behaviors that aim at reaching quick agreement without
genuine deliberation.
As a first step in our overall research endeavor, these
hypotheses are tested with self-reported measures of peer
collaboration behaviors in simulated interaction settings
(Study 1). The findings from this first study are then used to
test the effect of different goal instructions on peer
interaction behavior and on subsequent conceptual change
in actual learning settings (Study 2).

Study 1
Method
Participants. One hundred and eighty six students from the
Education (39%), Humanities (8%), Social Sciences (47%),
Law (3%) or other (3%) faculties participated in this study
(22% male, 78% female). Average age of participants was
24.47 (SD = 3.97), 170 students (91%) were of Jewish and
16 (9%) of Arab origin. Over half of the students (56%)
received course credit; others (44%) chose to be financially
reimbursed. Two participants failed to fill out one of the
questionnaires and their data was therefore included only in
the questionnaire validation procedures.
Procedure. Students were informed that the goal of the
research was to study different aspects of student learning
and discussion practices. They were then asked to fill out
two questionnaires. Order of presentation was
counterbalanced. In one questionnaire (the achievement goal
orientations questionnaire, students were asked to report on
their feelings and thoughts at the start of a new course as
part of their Major studies by responding to a pre-defined
set of test items. The other questionnaire, termed the Peer
Collaboration Behavior in Socio-cognitive Conflict
(PCBSC) questionnaire, included two sections: In the first
part, students were instructed to answer a question that
refers to the phenomena of day and night and to celestial
bodies. They were shown a picture of the earth which was
taken by a robot stationed on the moon (see Figure 1).
Students were then asked to indicate whether it was dark of
light on the moon location from which the picture was
taken. They were forced to choose one of the following four
responses and elaborate their choice: (a) It is light; (b) It is
dark; (c) There are no light and dark differences on the
moon; (d) One cannot know. This question was chosen
because students are not ignorant on astronomical events
and are capable to reason on the topic, whereas on the other
hand they are likely to have merely intuitive or partial
knowledge. Moreover, the question was complex enough to
leave room for doubt and for students to realize that they
could learn from another peer and from peer discussion.
After indicating their reasoned and elaborated answers, they
read the following instructions (part 2 of the PCBSC
questionnaire):
Try to imagine yourself in the following situation: You
participate in a small-size course and your lecturer
instructs each student to individually solve the Moon
question. After 5 min of individual work the lecturer
assigns the students to dyads and instructs each dyad to
discuss their solutions to the Moon question. When the
student you are assigned to presents his/her solution, it
appears that you disagree on what should be the correct
solution (i.e., he/she chose a different answer). How
would you behave in such a situation?

1634

Figure 1. "Is it dark or light on the moon location from
which this picture of the earth is taken?"
Students were then asked to report on their peer
collaboration behavior in this situation of socio-cognitive
conflict, by indicating the extent to which each of 16
different behaviors characterize them in this interaction. The
behavioral categories assessed were: Co-constructive
dialecticism, Private dialectical deliberation, Competitive
debating and Quick consensus seeking.
Measures. Achievement goals. Individual achievement goal
orientations were assessed with 18 items extracted from
Church and Elliott's (1997) scale, translated to Hebrew and
validated by Kogut (2002). There were six mastery goal
items (e.g., "I hope that after the course I will have a better
and deeper understanding of the topics we learned"), six

ability-approach goal items (e.g., "It is important for me to
perform better than the other students in this course") and
six ability-avoidance goal items (e.g., "I just want to avoid
failing the course").
Perceived domain knowledge and confidence. Students
rated their confidence in the correctness of their respective
explanation to the moon question, on a scale ranging from 1
(not at all confident) to 4 (very confident). Perceived
domain knowledge was assessed by one item ("How do you
evaluate your knowledge on astronomical topics, such as the
day/night cycle, the phases of the moon, seasonal changes,
celestial bodies, and so on?"). The scale ranged from 1
(none) to 5 (very high).
Peer collaboration behavior in socio-cognitive conflict
(PCBSC). Students were asked to report to what extent (on
a scale ranging from 1 = not at all to 7 = exactly) each item
would describe their behavior in the simulated situation of
discussing a scientific topic with a disagreeing peer. Fifteen
items were created based on the literature on peer dialogue
that supports conceptual change (see Table 1). Four items
each were created for three different behavioral categories:
Co-constructive, critical peer argumentation (items 1-4),
Competitive debating (items 5-8), and Quick consensus
seeking (items 9-12). A fourth type of behavior was defined,
Private critical deliberation, which refers to the critical
consideration of different perspectives in a private, nondialogical manner (items 13-15).

Results
Factorial structure of the PCBSC scales. Factor analyses
were conducted on the 15 peer collaboration behaviour
items via principal-components extraction with varimax
rotation. The results of these analyses are presented in Table
1 and yielded four factors: Factor 1 comprised the four
items of co-constructive, critical argumentation and
accounted for 19.2% of the variance. Factor 2 comprised the
four competitive debating items and item 12 ("reach a quick
agreement") and accounted for an additional 18.8% of the
variance. Factor 3 comprised the four quick consensus
seeking items and accounted for an additional 13.9%.
Finally, factor 4 comprised the three private critical
deliberation items and accounted for an additional 12.7%.
Together, the four factors accounted for a total of 64.6% of
the variance. Scale reliabilities of the different variables are
present in Table 2.
Overall, the PCBSC scales enabled the identification of
four distinctively different and reliable behavioral categories
for regulating socio-cognitive conflict.
Predicting conflict regulation with achievement goals For
each of the four behavioral categories we conducted twostep hierarchical regression analyses: The first model
included the three different types of achievement goals,
mastery,
performance-approach
and
performanceavoidance. In step 2, two predictors were added to the first
model: Confidence in correctness of one's explanation and
perceived domain knowledge. Results from the regression
analyses are summarized in Table 3.
Co-constructive critical argumentation: As expected,
mastery goals significantly predicted self-reported
engagement in co-constructive critical argumentation with a
peer. Neither one of the two ability goals, nor the measures
of confidence and domain knowledge significantly added to

this prediction. It should be noted, however, that the
standardized regression parameter for ability-avoidance
goals reached marginal significance (t (175) = 1.88, p =
.062). The total model accounted for 18% of the amount of
variance.
Competitive debating. Of the different achievement goals,
both ability-approach and mastery goals predicted the extent
to which students reported to engage in behavioral measures
of competitive debating. When the two additional variables
were entered into the regression equation, however, only
students' ability-approach goals and their self-reported
confidence in the correctness of their explanation
significantly predicted competitive debating, accounting for
a total of 19% of the variance.

Quick consensus seeking. As expected, ability-avoidance
goals significantly predicted quick consensus seeking. In
addition, mastery goals were negatively related with this
behavioral measure. The standardized parameter for mastery
goals was marginally significant in the first model (p =
.054) and reached significance in the second model (p =
.038). None of the other variables added to the prediction of
quick consensus seeking. The two models accounted for
9% and 7% of the total amount of variance, respectively.

Private critical deliberation. The first model accounted
for 11% of the total amount of variance, with mastery goals
significantly adding to the prediction of private deliberation,
and ability-approach reaching marginal significance (p =
.066). In the second model, the addition of the two
additional variables improved the predictive power of the
regression equation to some extent (∆R2 = .03). Both
students' mastery goals and their perceived domain
knowledge were found to significantly predict the extent to
which students reported to engage in critical , but private
deliberation.

Discussion
Based on the literature, we discerned between four
different types of behavioral patterns to regulate sociocognitive conflict in learning settings. The results in this
study showed first of all that these different patterns can be
distinctively and reliably assessed with the help of selfreport questionnaires.
Secondly, they also showed that students' achievement
goals predict different behavioral patterns of socio-cognitive
conflict regulation in learning settings. As expected,
mastery goals -but not ability goals- predicted coconstructive critical peer argumentation and abilityavoidance goals predicted quick consensus seeking.
Competitive debating, on the other hand, was predicted by
ability-approach goals and by students' confidence in the
correctness of their explanation. Finally, mastery goals and
domain knowledge predicted private critical deliberation.
The PCBSC scales assess individual dispositions for
different patterns of socio-cognitive conflict regulation in
learning settings. Previous studies have provided first
indications that one of these patterns, namely coconstructive critical argumentation, is particularly
productive for conceptual learning and conceptual change,
whereas others, namely competitive debating and quick
consensus-seeking, may be detrimental. However, the
effects of these different patterns have yet to be
experimentally tested. Moreover, students in Study 1 did not
experience actual socio-cognitive conflict and did not
actually engage in a learning activity. Therefore, learning
gains could not be assessed.
Therefore, the aim of study 2 is to experimentally test the
effect of goal instructions on students' behavioral patterns
and their conceptual learning gains in actual learning
activities that target conceptual change.

Study 2
We are currently in the process of collecting data from an
experimental set-up that involves at least forty
undergraduate students that participate in an actual learning
activity on evolutionary theory. In the present study, we test
the effect of different goal instructions on students' patterns
of socio-cognitive conflict regulation when asked to discuss
and solve learning items with a disagreeing peer. In one

condition, goal instructions are articulated in terms of
competitive argumentation, whereas in the other the
collaborative and constructive nature of dialectical
argumentation is emphasized. In addition to the direct effect
of such instructions on the interaction, we also assess how
they in turn affect individual cognitive gains from the
interaction, in the form of conceptual change.
The general procedure and materials for this study are
based on and adapted from the Asterhan & Schwarz (2007)
study. All students participate in the following sequence of
activities: 1) Individual pretest (T1) to assess prior
evolutionary understanding; (2) Instructional intervention:
screening of instructional movie excerpt on Darwinist
evolutionary theory; (3) Individual administration of a
single transfer test item (T2); (4) Experimental intervention:
Students are instructed to engage in un-scripted, computermediated peer argumentation on the T2 test item and a novel
transfer item, according to two different sets of goal
instructions for collaboration; (5) Post test (T3) immediately
following the experimental intervention; (6) Delayed post
test (T4) administered a week later. The total length of an
experimental session is approximately one and a half hour.
The assessment procedures for conceptual learning gains
are based on coding schemes developed by Asterhan and
Schwarz (2007). Coding schemes for dialogue analyses are
adapted from Asterhan and Schwarz (2009a), and focus not
only on the argumentative nature of dialogue moves, but
also on affective aspects of interpersonal communication
(e.g., Chiu & Khoo, 2003).
Data is currently collected. First findings will be presented
and discussed in the presentation.

Conclusions
Previous studies have shown that peer argumentation can
be a powerful instigator for conceptual change. However,
productive peer argumentation in learning settings is not
easily elicited and its benefits are likely to be dependent on
a number of preconditions that researchers have begun to
identify and investigate. We focused on achievement goal
orientations as one such precondition. Achievement goals
are sensitive to alterable external factors, such as classroom
climate, teacher behavior and task instructions (e.g., Butler,
1993). The results from this research therefore not only
benefit theory development, but have practical implication
for the field of education as well.
The research presented here should be viewed within the
larger framework of the "warming trend" in conceptual
change (Sinatra, 2005): Recently, research into conceptual
change have started to investigate the role of "hot"
constructs, such as topic interest, epistemological beliefs
(e.g., Mason, Bodrin & Gava, 2008), and affective factors
(e.g., Brem, 2008) in this particular form of learning. We
hope to have contributed to this accumulating body of
knowledge by focusing on the role of achievement goal
orientations.
