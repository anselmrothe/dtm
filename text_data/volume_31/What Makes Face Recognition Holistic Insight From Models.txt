Abstract: Traditionally, holistic processing of faces was believed to arise from a holistic perceptual representation.
Recent work applying General Recognition Theory (GRT) instead suggests a decisional form of holism, where deci-
sions about one part cannot be made independently of decisions about another part. We extend previous work using
GRT analyses and show the same decisional locus for holistic processing of faces by people and one well-known face
recognition model. We explore special cases of this model to determine what components of the model are sufficient
to produce human-like data. But why do these models produce human-like data? Within the GRT framework, these
models internally show violations of perceptual separability (indicative of perceptual holism) but no evidence of
decisional holism. Yet GRT analyses suggest decisional holism without perceptual holism. Our results raise serious
concerns about using the currently available GRT analyses to distinguish between perceptual and decisional holism
in face processing.
