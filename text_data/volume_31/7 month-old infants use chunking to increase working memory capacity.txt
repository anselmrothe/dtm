Abstract: Infant working memory quickly develops over the first year of life to reach the adult capacity of 3-4 items
(Luck & Vogel, 1997, Ross-Sheehy et al., 2003). However, both adults and 14 month-olds can overcome this limit by
chunking arrays into sets using spatial, perceptual and conceptual cues (Cowan et al., 2004
