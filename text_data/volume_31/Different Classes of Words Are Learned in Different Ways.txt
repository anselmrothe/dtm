The Weibull model: acceleration of sampling words
A small set of words are best fit by the Weibull model.
Many of these words (but not all) are closed class words
(Figure 2): The Weibull distribution is characterized by the
exponent parameter of polynomial function of age (i.e., d in
the model), and the threshold for learning is one (N=1). The
exponent parameter indicates how the number of sampled
events develops as a function of age (i.e., in constant,
accelerated, or decelerated rate). If the exponent d=1, the
number of sampled events increases linearly, but in case of
d=2, it increases as a square of age. Roughly, the exponent
parameters for words range from 1 to 9, meaning that most
words tend to be learned faster by older children.                   Figure 2: Mean acquisition rates in each word class as

looked to the how this parameter correlates with properties
of words known to be related to age of acquisition. Of all
the variables examined, only imageability was correlated
(R=0.564, p<0.01, n=351). Within the Weibull model, the
exponent d and AoA have a close relationship, since these
parameters are estimated from the AoA pattern. Thus, in
order to exclude a spurious correlation between the
exponent parameter via AoA, we analyzed the partial
correlation which subtracts the effect of AoA. Table 1

(n=351) The AoA in this analysis is defined the average
acquisition rates from 16 to 30 months. The AoA of all
individual words has positive correlation to the imageability
ratings. This means that words acquired earlier tend to be
easy to image. This is natural and consistent with the               Figure 3: Correlation between the threshold parameter
