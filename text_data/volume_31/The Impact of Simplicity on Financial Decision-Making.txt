                       3. Test Results
The tests results are presented in two blocks, one concerning
the information search and the other concerning the decision
strategies adopted by participants.
3.1 Part I: Information Search
In examining the approach followed by subjects in
exploring financial information, we started by considering
how much information an investor needed in order to arrive
at his or her financial decision. We investigated the
information search processes occurring both in Test Phase 1
(pair-wise investments comparison) and in Test Phase 2
(extended information search - financial market
exploration).
