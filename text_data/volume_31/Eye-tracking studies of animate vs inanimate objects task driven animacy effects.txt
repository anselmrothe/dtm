Abstract: We present here two eye-tracking experiments which demonstrate that animate objects are processed
differently to inanimate objects. Animate objects received significantly longer total looking time, longer looks and
a larger number of fixations than inanimates. Furthermore, cluster analyses demonstrated that eye fixations were
evenly distributed across inanimates, but clustered around particular features for animates. Crucially, the naming
condition had no effect on looking patterns, demonstrating that animacy, but not labelling, impacts looking behaviour
in this paradigm. Experiment 3 was run subsequently involving random presentation of both animate and inanimate
objects to clarify whether the difference in processing animates and inanimates reported in Experiments 1 and 2
simply reflected strategic responding in this task, rather than different underlying conceptual structures. The results
revealed no difference in processing animates and inanimates suggesting unitary, rather than feature-based model
of semantic organisation. Also, Experiments 1-3 suggest that one of the possible explanations for finding seemingly
contradictory results in literature regarding processing and representation of animates and inanimates in the brain
could lie in a variability of selected items within each of the categories.
