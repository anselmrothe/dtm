(Middleton, Wisniewski, Trindel, & Imai, 2003). Thus
aggregates present an interesting context in which to
examine how set size influences the conceptualization of
individuals as discrete entities versus continuous masses.
Number and size of aggregate units may play a role in their
perception. Accordingly, in our first two experiments in
this domain (reported here), we simultaneously manipulated
the number and size of the individual entities, keeping the
overall amount of stuff in the object collections constant
across levels.
                      Experiment 1
The task and its rational can be explained with respect to
Figure 1. Participants were first shown a single entity of a
particular shape and material (e.g, an inverted U-shaped
object made of wire mesh) and told its name. They were
then shown two choices of objects and asked which was in
the same category. One choice was a single item that
matched the exemplar in material but differed in shape; the
other was an array that contained 1 to 25 objects of the same
shape but of a different material. If participants attend to
both the shape and material of the individuals in the two
arrays, then there is a choice between a material matching
and a shape matching array. If however, sets with some
number of elements cause the shapes of the individual               Figure 1. Structure of the task.

matching array and a nonmatching array.              Thus, if

English which demands that every noun be a count or mass
noun. Based on pilot work, in these first experiments we
named the exemplar with a novel noun using a neutral
syntactic frame (useable with either count or mass nouns)
(This is the tiso). When the choice items were presented, we
asked Can you help me find more? so as to avoid
determiners and the plural. Pilot work indicated that this
framing of the question works for informal queries with
both count and mass nouns. (Both “Look at this cup. Help
me find more…” and “Look at this sand. Help me find
more…” are grammatically acceptable). We are currently
replicating the findings in a non-naming task to ensure that
this framing of the question did not in some way create the
observed pattern.
