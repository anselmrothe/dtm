Abstract: Two experiments were conducted to explore whether the OR structure works as a default causal model in
inferring the causal structure from the contingency data. The contingencies of three unfamiliar variables were used
in Experiment 1. Participants almost perfectly inferred the OR structure from the OR data, but incorrectly inferred
the OR structure from the AND data for about a little less than half of the time, and almost always inferred the
OR structure from the chain data. The result suggested that the OR interpretation can be the default causal model.
The prevalence of the OR interpretation from the contingency data was reported even when the three variables
were familiar ones in Experiment 2. Multinomial modeling performed on the results of the two experiments strongly
suggested that the OR interpretation work as a default causal model.
