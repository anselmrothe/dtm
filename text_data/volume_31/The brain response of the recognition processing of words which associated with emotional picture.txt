Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the recognition processing of words which associated with
emotional picture using fMRI. Fifteen normal volunteers were participated in this study. All participants performed
finding main theme task for emotional picture before recognition task. They had to select main theme among three
words (main theme, related to main theme, unrelated to main theme) for each emotional picture. In recognition task
using fMRI, participants had to discriminate old and new words. In the main condition compared with new condition,
participants showed activities in the right lingual gyrus, the bilateral anterior cerebellum and the middle frontal gyrus
(uncorrected p¡0.001, cluster size¿30). In the main condition compare with related condition, participants showed
activities in the right insula and the bilateral middle frontal gyrus. In this study, we found that they showed significant
activity in the region related to memory retrieval including the medial frontal gyrus on the main condition.
