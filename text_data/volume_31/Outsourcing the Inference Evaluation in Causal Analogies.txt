Abstract: In recent papers, Lee & Holyoak (2007, 2008a, 2008b) argue that models of analogy (ACME, LISA,
SMT) fail to explain how people draw inferences from causal analogies. L&H gave participants common-effect
scenarios and showed that their effect inference ratings dissociated from their similarity ratings contrary to the
predictions of structure-mapping theory (Gentner, 1983). L&H conclude that models of analogy should ”incorporate
the basic elements of causal models” (2008b, p1121), and that the evaluation of the causal inference ”cannot be
simply outsourced to some postanalogical module” (2008b, p1121).
  We replicated their study (Colhoun & Gentner, 2008). Here we show, in simulations using SME (Falkenhainer
et al., 1989), that evaluating the causal inference with an extremely simple post-analogical calculation matches the
human data very closely. We maintain that causal inference is indeed ”outsourced” to a postanalogical process.
