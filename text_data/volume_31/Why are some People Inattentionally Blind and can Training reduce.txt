Abstract

Visual attention can be directed at different levels of a
visual scene, with focus on the more holistic, global level or
on the more analytic, local level. IB individuals may differ
from NIBs (Not Inattentionally Blind) in their processing
style, with IBs adopting a narrower focus of attention than
NIBs, rendering them less likely to notice the unexpected
stimulus. If this were the case, then we might expect that
IBs would be more focused on local aspects of a processing
task relative to NIBs, with NIBs being more focused on
global aspects of the task. Navon (1977) found that global
differences were detected more frequently than local
differences, but manipulation of attentional set may bias
perception to one level or the other (Hoffman, 1980).
An alternative explanation is that IB is associated with a
lack of processing resources, and so the irrelevant stimulus
is simply not processed or is subjected to minimal
processing before being filtered out. We have previously
found working memory capacity (WMC) differences
correlated with IB such that those who demonstrated IB had
significantly lower WMC than those who were NIB
(Hannon & Richards, 2005, 2007; Davelaar, Hannon, &
Richards, 2004). We found support for Simons and Jensen
(2009) in showing no differences between NIBs and IBs in
performance on the primary task; however, we did find
robust individual differences in WMC, which predicted IB.
In Experiment 1, we examine both of these hypotheses
using a global-local flicker task, to measure differences in
processing style, an operation span task (OSPAN) to
measure working memory differences, and an IB task. If IB
individuals are characterized by a bias for a local level of
analysis, then we would predict a greater sensitivity for
local changes in a visual display compared to NIBs, and
greater sensitivity for global changes for NIBs compared to
IBs. If the limited resources hypothesis were supported, then
we would expect lower WMC for IBs compared to NIBs.

Inattentional Blindness (IB) occurs when an observer who is
engaged in a resource consuming task fails to notice an
unexpected although salient stimulus appearing in his/her
visual field. The incidence of IB can be affected by changes
in stimulus-driven properties of the display, but very little
research has examined individual differences in propensity for
IB. The current research examines individual differences in
working memory capacity, processing styles (flicker task) and
inhibition (Stroop task) in predicting IB. In addition, the
influence of training on IB is also examined. Experiment 1
showed that although there were no differences between IB
and NIB individuals (not inattentionally blind), in terms of
processing styles, individuals with lower working memory
capacity (WMC) were more likely to be IB. Experiment 2
examined differences in inhibition and working memory, and
found that working memory predicted the probability of IB
whereas inhibition did not. Levels of IB, however, were also
influenced by prior training. Compared to no training, training
on a task using the same primary task as that used in the IB
task produced greater reductions in IB, as did training on a
different task, where the effects were smaller, but significant.
We conclude that IB is related to working memory capacity
and that training can influence the incidence of IB.

Introduction
Inattentional blindness (IB) describes the situation in which
an observer, who is engaged in a resource-consuming task,
fails to notice an unexpected stimulus appearing in front of
their eyes. IB individuals have no difficulty seeing this
object (and show great surprise) when the scene is observed
for a second time but without any additional task.
Inattentional blindness occurs in everyday life and can be of
minimal importance (e.g., failing to notice your friend at the
cinema as you search for a vacant seat) or can have
catastrophic consequences (failing to notice a rogue
aeroplane in the flight path when flying). Research has
examined the stimulus components of the visual display that
influence the probability of IB occurring, but very little has
examined individual differences in IB. In all of the above
studies it is apparent that even though individuals are
presented with the same physical environment in which they
are presented with exactly the same stimuli, they do not
have the same subjective experience. Why is it that some
individuals are inattentionally blind whereas others are not?

Experiment 1
Method
Participants 77 participants were tested, but data from 9
were removed (7 misunderstood the task, 1 for dyslexia and
1 was outside the age range). The mean age of the
remaining 68 participants was 27.43 (SD = 9.45, range 18 to
56 years). There were 42 females.

Design and Procedure Participants completed the OSPAN
(Turner & Engle, 1989) and the global-local flicker tasks
(counterbalanced) and then an IB task (Most et al., 2000).

number of times the white letters hit the border during the
17 sec duration of the DVD. After 5 secs, a red cross moved
across the centre of the screen from right to left, taking 7
seconds. Participants were asked how many ‘hits’ there
were, and whether they saw anything else on the screen.

Task 1: Operation Span task Participants are required to
solve simple mathematical equations while memorising
unrelated words, with word lists varying between 2 and 5
words per set. For example: ‘does (10÷2) – 3 = 2 ? sea’.
Three sets of each list length are presented in an apparent
random order but fixed across participants. List length is
unknown to participants until the cue ??? appears, when
they must then write down the words they can remember
from that set, in the exact order they appeared. Scoring on
this task consists of summing the recalled words for only
those sets recalled completely and in the correct order, with
scores having a possible range of between 0 and 42.

Results
Out of the 68 participants, 36 (53%) failed to notice the
moving red cross and were therefore classified as ‘IB’. The
remaining participants reported seeing the red cross, and
were classified as ‘NIB’.
Local Global Flicker Task An examination of accuracy
and response latencies on the focal attentional task (set size
1) revealed no differences between IB and NIB individuals
for global or local trials. A comparison of change trials
(collapsed over local and global) and no-change trials
showed faster responses for change than no-change (1430
ms, SE = 35 and 1715 ms, SE = 71, respectively; F(1,66) =
32, p<.001, η2p=.33) but no accuracy differences. Change
detection during distributed attention was examined. An
ANOVA with display (local, global), set size (3, 5) as
within-subjects factors and blindness status (IB, NIB) as a
between-subjects factor revealed faster responses for global
than local changes (2932 ms, SE = 104, and 3165 ms, SE =
116, respectively; F(1,66) = 5.95, p=.02, η2p=0.08), and for
set size 3 than for 5 (means of 2620, SE = 76 and 3478, SE
= 136, respectively; F(1,66) = 84.13, p=.02, η2p=0.56. A
non-parametric Signal Detection Analysis (Snodgrass &
Corwin, 1988) was applied to the accuracy data for set sizes
3 and 5 combined (see Table 1). Sensitivity was greater for
global than local displays (means of 4.12, SE=.19, and 3.75,
SE = .19, respectively; F(1,66) = 13.60, p<.001, η2p=0.17),
but there were no differences involving inattentional
blindness status (Fs <1). There were no significant effects
from the analysis of the response bias scores.

Task 2. Global-Local Flicker Task: The flicker task was
adapted from Austen and Enns (2000). Two large (global)
letters (E and S) were created using letters also E and S
(local component; see Figure 1).

50% of the local letters were consistent with the global letter
and 50% inconsistent. Each stimulus measured 48 x 78
pixels, and was shown in displays of alternating frames of 1,
3 or 5 items. Set size 1 examined change detection during
focused attention, and set size 3 and 5 examined change
detection during distributed attention. Each display appeared
for 225 ms with a blank frame interleaved for 225 ms. This
alternation gave the appearance of a flickering display,
which continued until the participant pressed the M key on
the keyboard to indicate that a change had occurred (either a
local or a global change) or the Z key to indicate that no
change had occurred. A change occurred on 50% of trials,
and half of these changes were local and the other half
global. Items appeared randomly in one of nine squares of
an imaginary 3 x 3 matrix. There was a practice block of 48
trials followed by 3 experimental blocks of 80 trials.

Task 3: IB Task IB was measured using a task from D. J.
Simons’ (2003) ‘Surprising studies of visual awareness’
DVD. This task was based on an original task by Most et al.
(2000) in which four black and four white letters (Ls and
Ts) move haphazardly around the screen, frequently
‘hitting’ the borders of the display. Participants were asked
to track the four white letters (2 Ls and 2 Ts) but to ignore
the four black letters. They were required to count the

IB and Working Memory Capacity The IB individuals
had lower OSPAN scores than the NIB individuals (means
of 15.11 SD = 7.75 and 19.56, SD = 6.62 respectively; t(66)
= 2.57, p=.013, η2p= .09), indicating that lower WMC is
associated with IB.

proposal will be examined in Experiment 2. We will also
examine the effects of training on the incidence of IB.

Experiment 2
The ability to inhibit an irrelevant stimulus is an extremely
useful process in most circumstances, as it ensures that the
individual maintains attentional focus on the task goal
thereby avoiding the disruptive influence of irrelevant
information. However, such a process brings with it
potential costs, as in the case of the appearance of an
ostensibly irrelevant stimulus that is highly significant. The
tendency to have good inhibitory processes is correlated
with high levels of working memory capacity (WMC).
WMC is viewed by many researchers as involving
controlled attention (e.g., Turner & Engle, 1989). Bleckley
et al. (2003) propose that there are differences in attentional
control between high and low WMC individuals, with the
former having a more flexible discontiguous attentional
allocation whereas the latter have a spotlight of attention,
which is a continuous but less flexible mode of attentional
allocation. They argue that high WMC individuals are more
able to inhibit and control attention. Kane et al. (2001)
found no difference between high and low WMC
individuals in a prosaccade task, but compared to low WMC
individuals, high WMC individuals had superior
performance on the antisaccade task in which the saccade
towards the cue had to be suppressed in favour of a saccade
in the opposite direction. If IB is as a result of inhibitory
processes, then it is predicted that individuals with high
levels of inhibition will be more likely to be IB. It might
also be expected from this perspective that IB would be
associated with higher levels of WMC.
In the current experiment, we directly compare an
inhibition hypothesis with a reduced capacity hypothesis,
and we look at the effects of training on IB. As participants
become more practiced there should be a corresponding
increase in available attentional resources. We therefore
predict that training will decrease the incidence of IB.
However, an alternative prediction from the inhibition
hypotheses is that an increase in available resources will
enable irrelevant stimuli to be successfully inhibited, with a
corresponding increase in the incidence of IB. Whether
practice on video games can improve attentional perceptual
tasks is a matter for debate. Green and Bavelier (2007), for
example, found improvements on such tasks, whereas Boot
et al. (2008) found no effects after 20 hours of practice in
non-gamers.
Neisser (1979) describes a study where individuals were
presented with a video scene in which a woman with an
umbrella walks through a basketball game. Prior to this,
participants had completed an easier task, a more difficult
task, or no task. Neisser concludes that people fail to see an
unexpected object in situations where they believe the task
to be difficult. Although essential details are missing from
the account of this study, it does suggest that practice may
have a beneficial effect on reducing incidences of IB. The
current study examines the incidence of IB after (a) no

IB, Working Memory Capacity and Sensitivity to Local
and Global Visual Changes In order to examine the
influence of WMC and sensitivity to global and local
changes in predicting the probability of IB, a simultaneous
entry logistic regression was performed. IB was the outcome
variable and age, sex and latency differences (global minus
local latencies) were predictors (see Table 2)1. This analysis
revealed that only OSPAN was a significant predictor.

Discussion
Inattentional Blindness was observed in 53% of the sample,
and this is consistent with our own and other research, e.g.,
Most et al. (2000). There were no differences between local
and global detection when attention was focused, but when
attention was divided all participants showed increased
sensitivity for global than local visual changes on the flicker
task (in line with Navon, 1977; and Austen & Enns, 2000).
There were no differences between the IBs and NIBs,
showing no support for the notion that IB individuals are
characterized by an increase in analytical processing
compared to NIB individuals. However, the IBs were shown
to have lower WMC than the NIBs, which supports our
earlier research in this area. The logistic regression gives
weight to this conclusion, showing that only OSPAN
significantly predicted the probability of IB, with the latency
difference on local and global displays playing no role.
We have shown that WMC is very important in IB, but
there may be additional influential variables. One such
proposal is that IB individuals fail to notice the unexpected
stimulus because they have successfully inhibited it. This

training, (b) after training on the same task as the primary
task in the final IB task (i.e., counting white Ls and Ts) and
(c) after training on a different task (i.e., counting diamonds
and triangles). We predict that training will reduce the
incidence of IB compared to the no training control
condition.
By having a same and different training
condition, we will be able to examine whether general
training on the task will transfer to a different but similar
task. We will also examine whether training, inhibition or
WMC predicts the incidence of IB.

each set size (3, 4, 5, 6, 7), producing a total of 75 letters
and 75 maths problems. Order of set sizes is randomized.
Five scores are calculated: The ‘Operation Span’ (total
number of perfectly recalled sets); the ‘Total Number
Correct’ (total number of letters recalled in the correct
position); ‘Maths errors’ is divided into ‘speed errors’ and
‘accuracy errors’.
Task 2: Stroop Task There were four colour–word
conditions. In the control (neutral) condition, strings of
XXXs were printed in coloured inks. In the congruent
condition, the word and colour of the ink matched. In the
ignored repeated condition, ink colour and word colour
name conflicted, but in addition, the colour of the ink on
trial n corresponded to the word on trial n−1. In the
incongruent condition, each word again was the name of a
colour, which conflicted with the coloured ink, but there
was no such relationship between successive trials here.
There were 8 experimental blocks, each comprising trials
of the same type (e.g., all control trials). There were 2
blocks for each of the 4 types of trials. Within each block,
there were 32 trials, and the four colours (red, green, yellow
and blue) appeared an equal number of times. After each of
the 8 blocks, participants were allowed to take a short break
Each trial began with a fixation cross for 500 ms, which
was replaced by the target (colour word or row of Xs)
presented in one of the four colours. Colours were identified
using colour-coded keys on the keyboard. There was a
practice block of 20 trials at the start of the experiment.

Method
Participants 87 participants took part, but 3 were excluded
because they misunderstood the IB task and 2 for
misunderstanding the Stroop task. A total of 82 participants
(62 females) with a mean age of 32.37 (SD = 7.90; range 21
to 56 years) took part in the experiment.
Design and Procedure Participants were randomly
allocated to one of three training conditions (Control, Same
and Different). However, before completing this final task
(Task 3), all participants performed two additional tasks that
were counterbalanced across participants. Task 1 was the
Automatic Operation Span (AOSPAN) task of Unsworth et
al. (2005) and Task 2 was a Stroop task.
Task 1: AOSPAN task The Automated Operation Span
Task (AOSPAN) measures WMC, and was used here for
three reasons. First, the task is performed alone, thereby
reducing anxiety levels. Anxiety is predicted to use working
memory resources (e.g., Eysenck et al., 2007) and may
increase the error in measuring WMC. Second, the task is
less reliant on language, as letters rather than words are
presented. Finally, using a different OSPAN task allows us
to test the WMC hypothesis under different circumstances.
In the AOSPAN task, a series of maths problems are
presented that need to solve as quickly as possible. Each
problem is followed by a letter for later recall. The total
number of letters recalled at the end of each trial being
calculated. In the first practice phase, a number of letters are
presented for 800 ms (with this being the same for all
experimental blocks). A 4 x 3 matrix of letters (F, H, J, K,
L, N, P, Q, R, S, T, Y) is then presented. Participants click a
box next to the appropriate letters in the exact order they
had appeared. Feedback is given on the number of letters
recalled in the right order. In the second practice phase, a
series of 15 maths problems, e.g. ‘(1*2) + 1 = ?’ are
presented, to be solved as quickly as possible. On the next
screen a possible answer e.g. ‘3’ and two boxes with ‘True’
or ‘False’ is presented. Participants check the correct box,
and accuracy feedback is given. Average solution times are
calculated (plus 2.5 SD), and are used as a time limit for the
maths portion of the task. Speed errors are recorded for
responses outside this limit, which discourages participants
from using strategies to help recall. In the third practice
session, both the letter recall and the maths problems are
performed. The experimental trials comprised three sets of

Task 3: Training and IB Task
We predict that training will reduce the levels of IB, and
therefore to allow for training effects the IB task was made
more difficult with the number of bounces off the border
increasing from 12 in Experiment 1 to 16 in Experiment 2.
The task was programmed in Matlab and was based on that
of Most et al. (2000). As before, those who reported the
presence of the red plus sign were deemed to be NIBs and
those who were unable to report its presence were IBs.

Figure 2: A still frame from the IB task, showing the red
cross transversing the screen.
Control Condition Here participants were presented with
the IB task without any pre-training (Figure 2).
Different Training Condition In this condition (Figure 3),
participants were presented with two training sessions with
moving diamonds and triangles that bounced off the screen.
Each training screen lasted for 17 sec. Participants were
then presented with the IB task (Figure 2). The instructions

times the white items (in this case, diamonds and triangles)
hit the border between the grey and white areas.

appears that IBs tend to have lower WMC than NIBs but
WMC is not influential in identifying which individuals
would benefit from training in order to reduce their chances
of displaying IB.
Facilitation, inhibition (Stroop), and IB An analysis of the
Stroop data with condition (congruent, control, incongruent,
ignored repetition) as a within-subjects factor and training
(control, same, different) and IB (IB, NIB) as betweensubjects factors was performed. There was a main effect of
condition (F (3,228) = 11.79, p<.001, η2p = .134), with no
facilitation for control compared to congruent (means of
830, SD = 155 and 836 ms, SD = 174, respectively) but
significant inhibition with RTs to incongruent being
significantly faster than ignored repetition (means of 880
SD = 185 and 910 ms, SD = 199, respectively; t(81) = 2.54,
p =.013, η2p = .074). There were no main or interaction
effects involving IB, and therefore no evidence from the
Stroop task that IB is associated with increases in inhibition.

Figure 3: A still frame from the different training task.
Same Training Condition: Here there were two training
sessions involving 4 Ls and 4 Ts moving across the screen
and hitting the border (as in Figure 2, but without the
unexpected stimulus). The two training programs in this
condition matched those in the different condition in terms
of the random seed used to generate the movements, so that
the direction and number of ‘hits’ were the same. Following
these, the critical IB task was presented. Participants were
instructed to count the number of times the white items (in
this case, Ls and Ts) hit the grey/black border.

Working memory; inhibition; training, and IB To test
the relative contributions of training, WMC and inhibition
in predicting the probability of inattentional blindness,
simultaneous entry logistic regression was performed where
IB was the outcome variable and training, inhibition, age,
sex, and AOSPAN scores were the predictors (Table 3).
Both AOSPAN and Training predicted the probability of IB,
but inhibition did not. There were significant effects of
different training compared to control, and for different
compared to same training.
Table 3: Results of simultaneous entry logistic regression
for Experiment 2.

Results
Training effects on incidence of IB The number of IBs and
NIBs in the three training conditions were subjected to chisquare analyses (Figure 4). There was a significant
association between the incidence of IB and training (χ2 =
17.01, N = 82, df = 2, p<.001, Φ = .46). There were more
IBs than NIBs in the control condition compared to the
same (χ2 = 17.04, N = 57, df = 1, p<.001, Φ = .55) and
compared to the different training condition (χ2 = 3.86, N =
60, df = 1, p=.05, Φ = .25). In addition, there were more IBs
than NIBs in the different compared to the same training
conditions (χ2 = 4.07, N = 47, df = 1, p=.03, Φ = .32).

Discussion
Again, we have demonstrated the relationship between IB
and WMC, with low WMC being more likely to be IB than
high WMC individuals. Although inhibition was observed
in the group as a whole, the IBs did not display greater
inhibition on the Stroop task. Training had a significant

effect on the incidence of IB, with training on a task that is
similar to the IB task reducing IB compared to both control
(no training) and different training. Training on a similar
task (same) rather than a different task is also beneficial.
These findings suggest that IB can be manipulated by
training, which may have implications for training of, for
example, drivers and pilots. These data support the idea that
training frees up resources, which increase the probability
that the unexpected stimulus will be detected. We found no
support for the idea that this proposed increase in resources
results in increased inhibition of the unexpected stimulus.

General Discussion
In two experiments we have demonstrated robust effects of
WMC on predicting the likelihood of IB. We have shown
this using both the standard OSPAN task and the automated
AOSPAN task. We have further demonstrated that there
were no differences in processing styles on the flicker task,
and no differences in terms of inhibition. Of particular
interest were the effects of training on the incidence of IB,
and here we showed clearly that training on a task similar to
the IB task produces the greatest benefits in terms of
reducing IB but there are also some benefits to be gained
from training on a different IB task. The predicted increase
in attentional resources from training appears to make the
unexpected stimulus more likely to be seen rather than less,
and is therefore consistent with a working memory rather
than an inhibition account of IB.
Further research is necessary to examine different types of
training over different time scales. For example, do the
effects endure over long intervals? Neisser (1979) argues
that it is the perception of difficulty that is important in
determining whether an unexpected stimulus is detected. If
individuals expect the primary task to be difficult, then they
are more likely to fail to detect the unexpected stimulus.
Systematic variations of these variables need to be
performed to examine their effects on IB. We also predict a
dual route model, in which low WMC individuals fail to
notice the irrelevant stimulus because they do not have
sufficient resources to process information outside the goals
of the primary task, whereas high WMC individuals, who
do show IB, do so because they are actively inhibiting the
irrelevant stimulus. Research is currently underway to
examine all of these proposals.
