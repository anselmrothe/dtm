Subjects
The subjects were 108 Vanderbilt University students who
were recruited during two consecutive fall semesters. They
participated in partial fulfillment of course requirements for
introductory psychology (10 females, 5 males) or
evolutionary biology (25 females, 27 males), or for extra
credit in the psychology (21 females, 2 males) or education
(15 females, 3 males) class from which they were recruited.
   The subjects were divided into two groups based on their
background in biology. Stronger background subjects had
taken at least the two-semester introductory biology
sequence required for biology majors and pre-med students.
Weaker background subjects had not completed these two
classes and typically had little exposure to biology. There is
a very large difference in biology background between the
two groups, as can be seen in the mean number of courses
taken (of those listed on our questionnaire). The 54 stronger             Figure 2: A reptile triad in the no diagram condition.

The data from the two types of triads were analyzed
separately because different variables were manipulated in
their construction. For both types of triads, subjects’ ratings
for the evolutionarily-inappropriate taxon choice were
coded on a scale from -5 (very likely) to -1 (a bit more
likely); their ratings for the evolutionarily-appropriate taxon
choice were coded on a scale from 1 (a bit more likely) to 5
