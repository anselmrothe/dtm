Procedure Participants were asked to decide whether a
target noun was better described by a stereotypically
feminine, masculine, or neutral adjective. The adjectives
used were obtained in Study 1. Participants were randomly
divided into the Labeled condition, the Unlabeled condition,
or the Survey condition.
   In the Labeled and Unlabeled conditions, participants
were shown forty-eight clipart pictures of target nouns and
were asked, “Is this [adjective judged as feminine /
masculine / neutral in Study 1]? Or is this [adjective judged
as feminine / masculine / neutral in Study 1]?” An example
trial would involve showing the participant a clipart picture
of an object (e.g., a dolphin) and asking, “Is this pretty? Or
is this messy?” Participants were asked to choose one of the
two statements. The Labeled and Unlabeled conditions
involved the same procedure, except that in the Labeled
condition, participants were shown the clipart pictures with
the object named underneath (e.g., Dolphin); in the
Unlabeled condition, participants were shown only the
clipart pictures.

some associations appear to be stronger than others. Apple,
toothbrush, and mitten were judged to be very strongly
feminine; towel, volcano, and tooth were judged to be very
strongly masculine; and knife, house, and nose were rated as
relatively neutral. Some nouns—e.g., cloud, diaper, leaf,
sun, and truck—did not have a consistent gender across
conditions; this requires further investigation into the roles
pictures and words play in our understanding of language.
   There are many questions raised by Studies 1 and 2 that
require further investigation. One such question involves the
developmental trajectory of these gender associations in
children, an issue we explore in Studies 3 and 4.

gendered language can still be explained by grammatical
gender, through the influence of a “heritage” grammatical
gender on a related non-gendered language. In the case of
English, the “heritage” grammatical gender would be
derived from its Latinate and Germanic roots. To test for
this possibility, further studies must be conducted in which
the “heritage” of these nouns is varied more systematically.
