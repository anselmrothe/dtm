that the P3 component is delayed during the AB (Sessa et

effect is obtained in ST2 since blaster firing is delayed
during the AB (encoding of the first target into WM
suppresses the blaster). Consequently, the model’s analogue
of the P3 and WM encoding/consolidation is also delayed.
The two-phase strength sensitivity theory
The ST2 model cannot explain our experimental results.
Consequently, we propose a modified theory: the two-phase
strength sensitivity theory, which is based on theoretical
concepts from ST2 with some new principles, and uses

to the P3 component, while the latter is assumed to reflect a
more global activation (perhaps, akin to the global brain
scale state in Dehaene et al. (2003)), and is assumed to be
the major contributor to the P3 component.
   It is important to note that, in ST2, bottom up strength is
determined by input strength. This input strength ranges
from what we will call strong to weak. The easy/hard
categories are then sampled from this complete range, such
that, the easy/hard sub ranges overlap, with the former
having a higher mean than the latter. We will talk in terms
of the easy (respectively hard) range of values, which
themselves contain a profile of weak and strong values.
