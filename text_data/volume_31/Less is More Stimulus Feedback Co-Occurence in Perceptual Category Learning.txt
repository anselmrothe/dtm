                          Introduction
There is nearly unanimous agreement that category learning                 a.                                  b.
is mediated by multiple, distinct neural systems (e.g. Ashby,
Alfonso-Reese, Turken, & Waldron, 1998). Even so, much
is still unknown about the processing characteristics of each
system. Two distinct neural systems have been the focus of
much research and are thought to mediate different types of
category-learning. An explicit hypothesis-testing system is
thought to mediate rule-based category learning, and relies
on frontal brain regions and the head of the caudate nucleus.
An implicit procedural-learning system is thought to
mediate information-integration category learning, and
relies on the body and tail of the caudate nucleus. Rule-
based learning involves testing verbalizable rules in order

categories.        Information-integration learning involves
associating regions of perceptual space with actions that                  Figure 1: (a) Plot of stimuli from the rule-based category
