Abstract: Implicit mental rotation tasks involving body parts have been shown to reflect biomechanical properties of
the corresponding motor performance (Parsons, 1987, 2001). These findings have raised the issue of the involvement
of motor representations, and not just visual ones, both in the simulation of body movements (Sirigu & Duhamel,
2000) and the mental rotation (MR) of other kinds of objects (de’Sperati & Stucchi, 2000). In this study our main
question is to understand to what extent motor imagery underlies mental rotation outside the realm of body segments
and how MR works among subjects who were never able to experience physical rotations of certain parts of the body,
as cerebral palsy subjects. Main outcomes go as follows: both groups exhibit a similar pattern of constraints on the
hands task
