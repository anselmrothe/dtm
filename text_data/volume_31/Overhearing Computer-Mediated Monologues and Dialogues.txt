Abstract: The question of how much speakers consider their addressees perspectives is a topic of debate. In these
experiments, I examine this question in a novel way by observing overhearer reactions to the conversational constraints
set on the conversations interlocutors. I compare how the overhearers to monologues and dialogues understand
directions. These experiments were conducted in a computer-mediated environment, but are expected to have a
degree of generalizability to face-to-face communication as well as implications for human-computer interaction.
Keywords: grounding in communication; perspective-taking; in-group and out-group differences; audience design;
overhearer effects.
