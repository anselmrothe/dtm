find out that A and C occurred actually independent of each
other. Thus, our study goes beyond previous research in
which the data on the relation of A and C was not available
(Ahn & Dennis, 2000; Baetu & Baker, in press).
   However, if people only base their judgments on the inte-
gration of individual links, different judgments for the rela-
tion between A and C are expected depending on whether
people make a transitive inference from A to C based on the
A to B and B to C relations, or estimate the relation between
A and C directly from the data.
