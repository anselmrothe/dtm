Instead, children’s discrete search choices (indicated by

potentially multiple discrete searches as children lifted
tiles before finding the target square. Each search before
finding the target in every trial was coded as one of five
types, in two general categories, spatial and non-spatial.
Spatial types were peripheral (searching under a tile

pool as the goal), or adjacent (searching under a tile
immediately adjacent to the goal). Non-spatial searches
were social (lifting the tile under another person),
