   While the Huttenlocher and Laurenco hypothesis provides
a potential explanation for why children sometimes fail to
use non-geometric information, it does not explain how
adults come to successfully incorporate such information
(e.g., Hermer-Velasquez, Spelke, & Katsnelson 1999;
Ratcliff & Newcombe 2008). Complete understanding of
human reorientation abilities requires examination of the
mature system. One possibility is that adults use of non-
geometric information hinges on the ability to encode and
maintain categorical properties. The developmental shift
from reliance on continuous properties to reliance on
categorical encoding is likely reflected in, and possibly
aided by, the mastery of linguistic labels. The current study
explores these ideas by comparing adult reorientation in a
case where a categorical contrast was required to specify a
spatial location versus a case where a non-categorical
contrast was required. The results indicate that categorical
encoding is necessary for success. Below we present the
