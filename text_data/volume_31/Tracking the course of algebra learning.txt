Abstract: An understanding of human cognition can guide the design of algebra instruction. For instance, con-
siderations of the relatively limited capacity of human working memory paired with the relatively limitless capacity
of long term memory have influenced educational practices. Our research attempts to provide a theoretical basis
for balancing exploration and direction in education. Advocates of discovery learning argue that with discovery
comes a substantially richer problem representation. In contrast, advocates of direct instruction argue that discovery
learning is incompatible with human cognition, particularly because memory demands imposed by exploration of the
problem space hinder students ability to extract meaningful relations from the problem episode. Here, we explore
the outcomes associated with varying degrees of guidance. Specifically, we consider how the timing of feedback and
the availability of instruction affect college students as they learn to solve isomorphs of algebra problems.
