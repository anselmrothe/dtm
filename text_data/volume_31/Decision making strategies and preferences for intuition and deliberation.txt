Abstract: This study examined the strategies used to make decisions and the relationship of these strategies to
preferences for using deliberation and intuition in decision making. Participants (N = 84) made two decisions and

one of the four was consistent with the use of each of 1) a weighted additive strategy (WADD), 2) Dawes rule, 3)
the take-the-best heuristic (TTB), and 4) a minimalist strategy. Overall, 48
