A Sample-size-invariant Estimation of Lexical Diversity

Abstract: In a long history of studies on language development, lexical diversity has been used as one measure of
vocabulary growth. A typical analysis, type-token ratio, or a ratio of sample size of words to the number of unique
types of words, has been used as a measure of lexical diversity. As the type-token ratio is not valid for vocabulary sets
with different token sample sizes, an improved measure has recently been proposed. In the present study, however,
we show that the diversity estimated by past proposed measures is not robust enough for the corpus of different
sample sizes. Accordingly, we propose a new formal model of lexical diversity, which distinguishes the latent number
of types and property of frequency distribution robustly for different token sizes. We then compared this proposed
model to other measures of lexical diversity. In addition, we applied the method to actual vocabulary development
data.
