Abstract: To determine if trait anxiety affects the distribution of facial attention, 40 NMSU undergraduates par-
ticipated in three one-hour sessions wherein an experimenter wearing 4 L.E.D lights (left-cheek, chin, right-cheek,
forehead) realistically presented, per session, 40 narratives, each divided into six segments, in one of five negative
(afraid, angry, embarrassed, frightened, sad) styles. During each narrative section either none or one of four lights
fired for 5ms.
   Accompanying their significant reduction in trait anxiety scores (t = 4.147, df =19 p=.001 ยก .05), high anxiety
participants also increased their distribution of facial attention, with significant improvement in detecting left-cheek
lights (t=3.589 df = 4, p=.015) and nearly significant improvement (t= 2.460, df = 4, p = .063) for right-cheek
lights. Low anxiety participants did not exhibit any significant results.
   Our data suggests that high trait anxiety participants redistribute their facial attention over time: even in response
to overwhelmingly negative stimuli.
