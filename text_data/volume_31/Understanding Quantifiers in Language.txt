   Moreover, we have additionally compared Aristotelian
quantifiers with cardinal quantifiers of higher rank, for in-
stance “less than 8”. In the study of McMillan et al. (2005)
only one cardinal quantifier of relatively small rank was taken
into consideration, namely “at least 3”. We predict that
complexity of the mental processing of cardinal quantifiers
depends on the number of states in the relevant automata.
Therefore, cardinal quantifiers of high rank should be more
difficult than Aristotelian quantifiers (see Figure 2 for more
explanation). Additionally, presumably the number of states
in automata (size of memory needed) influences comprehen-
sion more directly than the use of loops. Hence, we hypothe-
size that the reaction time for the comprehension of cardinal
quantifiers of higher rank is between that for parity and pro-
portional quantifiers.
