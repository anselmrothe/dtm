   Until a pair has appeared with all other pairs in the
vocabulary, increasing within-trial ambiguity can yield
greater contextual diversity. Will the toll of increased
ambiguity outweigh the advantages of increased contextual
diversity? Similarly, greater pair frequency can yield greater
contextual diversity until that pair has been seen with all
other pairs. Are repetitions solely crucial as learning
opportunities, or as a means to increase contextual
diversity? The current studies systematically investigate          Figure 1: Word-referent co-occurrence matrices for the two

   Why did increased frequency aid learning in one
condition, but not the other? How can it be explained that
pairs of frequency 3, 6, and 9 are learned at equal levels?
One plausible explanation is that once a pair is learned,
future trials containing that pair effectively have reduced
within-trial ambiguity. For example, if a learner sees (A B; a

   Greater within-trial ambiguity not only creates more
possible associations on each trial, but also influences CD:
In the 3 pairs/trial conditions, each pair appears on 6 trials,
and thus appears with 12 other pairs during training (unique
or not), In the 4 pairs/trial condition, each pair appears with
18 other pairs during training, as it occurs on 6 trials with 3
other pairs. Thus, pairs in the 4 pairs/trial condition
appeared with more diverse pairs than pairs in the 3
pairs/trial conditions. Moreover, note in Table 1 that the 12
medium CD group pairs have very similar CD – by both
metrics – to the uniform/3 pairs condition, since pairs in
both these groups appeared with only 12 other pairs.               Figure 4: Accuracy for 4 pair groups that differ in CD and
