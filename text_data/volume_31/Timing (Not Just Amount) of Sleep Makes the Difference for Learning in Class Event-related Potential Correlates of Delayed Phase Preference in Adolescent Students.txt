Abstract
Adolescents tend to experience alterations in their sleep
cycles inducing them to go to sleep and wake up at later times
than they typically would at younger age (Delayed Sleep
Phase, DSP). We asked a relatively homogeneous sample (N
= 22) of female high-school students to maintain an
exhaustive sleep log during two weeks. Within this period,
we randomly assigned each participant to a morning or
afternoon testing condition (morning vs. afternoon group), in
which we measured performance data along with ERPs
during a standard Stroop task. The sleep log data confirmed a
two-hour DSP in both groups. Participants in the afternoon
group performed significantly better (less Stroop interference)
than those in the morning group and showed a differential
ERP pattern to incongruent and congruent stimuli, not shown
by the morning group. We conclude that DSP can be
associated with an attentional impairment in the morning.

As children transition to adolescence, they tend to
experience alterations in their sleep cycles (Delayed Sleep
Phase, DSP) which may induce them to go to sleep and
wake up at a later time than they typically would (Crowley,
Acebo, & Carskadon, 2007; Fischer, Radosevic-Vidacek,
Koscec, Teixeira, Moreno, & Lowden, 2008; Mitru,
Millrood, & Mateika, 2002). We investigated the influence
of sleep cycles on the performance of adolescent females
during mornings and afternoons of ordinary school days by
examining neural correlates of cognitive performance using
Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), along with behavioral
data. Our results support previous research which has found
that early school start times, which do not accommodate the
DSP observed in adolescents, result in poor academic
performance (Epstein, Chillag, & Lavie, 1998; Fischer,
Radosevic-Vidacek, Koscec, Teixeira, Moreno, & Lowden,
2008; Hansen et al., 2005; Walhstrom, Wrobel, & Kubow,
1998). The findings of our study show that adolescents
tested in the morning are cognitively performing at a low
level in comparison to their counterparts tested in the
afternoon. Furthermore, the poor cognitive performance
observed in the morning was associated with significantly
different ERP patterns which appear to be evidence of a
deficit in attentional resources and an impeded ability to
respond when competing stimuli are present.

Method
Participants
Twenty two female adolescents, ranging in age from 16 to
18, were recruited from grades 11 and 12 psychology
classes at a high school in Central Southern, British
Columbia. Participants took part in the study for course
credit in their psychology class.
Measures
Stroop Task. A standard version of the Stroop
Colour-Word Task, selected from STIM (Neuroscan,
Compumedics Ltd.). Stimulus duration was set at 200 ms
with an inter-trial interval of 1000 ms. Participants’
response time and accuracy were measure through a handheld response pad. To counterbalance any possible novelty
effects incongruent stimuli were presented at a higher
frequency than congruent stimuli (Macloed, 1991) at a ratio
of approximately 3:1, 224 trials and 76 trials respectively,
for a total of 300 trials.
Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). EEG was
recorded concurrently with the Stroop task. Electrodes were
placed at: Pz, P3, P4, Cz, C3, C4, Fz, F3, and F4
(International System) with reference electrode at nose tip.
An electro-oculogram (EOG) was vertically placed above
and below. Using the standard eye movement reduction
algorithm devised by Semlitsch, Anderer, Schuster and
Presslich (1986), the EOG was used to filter out artifacts
due to eye movement from the relevant EEG signal.
Impedance was kept below 5Ω. High and low pass filters
were set at 0.5Hz and 30Hz respectively. Time locking was
implemented through an internal serial port trigger
synchronized with stimulus presentation.
2-week sleep-log questionnaire. The sleep log
questionnaire was adapted from the Thompson Rivers
University
Respiratory
Therapy
Program
Sleep
Questionnaire. The questionnaire was used to assess the
sleeping schedules of participants over a two week period
including weekends.
Pre- and Post-Stroop affective questionnaires.
Before and after the Stroop task, participants completed a 5point rating scale measuring affective states, adapted from
an affective questionnaire (Usala & Hertzog, 1989), and a
task appraisal questionnaire (Tomaka et al., 1999).
Procedure
The participants began recording their sleeping schedule
over a two week period beginning on the Thursday

1768

preceding the first testing phase. They were then randomly
assigned to the AM or PM testing group. Test and retest
sessions were conducted from 8:30 – 10:30 a.m. (AM
testing group), and 12:15 – 12:55 p.m. (PM testing group);
each participant was tested at the same time on test and
retest. On the day of testing, each participant was first
administered the pre-Stroop questionnaire, then the EEG
cap with embedded electrodes was placed on the participant
and the Stroop task testing phase was conducted. Upon
conclusion of the Stroop task, the EEG cap was removed
and the post-Stroop questionnaire was administered.

Results

showed an increase in their level of accuracy; Test 1 and
Test 2 yielded M = 75% (SD = 13) and M = 83% (SD =
15), respectively. None of these means were significantly
different. Each participant’s mean accuracy was then used to
determine their individual mean level of Stroop interference
(computed as Mcongruent - Mincongruent). For Test 1, morning
and afternoon participants showed an average Stroop
interference of M = 23% (SD =12) and M = 13% (SD =9)
respectively. For Test 2, participants showed an average
Stroop interference of M = 20% (SD =16) in the morning,
and M = 10% (SD =19) in the afternoon. Stroop interference
changed significantly according to the time of day, morning

Sleep Logs
It was found that participants’ total sleep per night ranged
between M = 7 hr 35 min (SD =1 hr 45 min) and M =8 hr 2
min (SD =2 hr 18 min) regardless of whether it was the
weekend or a school night (Figure 1).

During the school week participants reported mean falling
asleep times between M =11:04 p.m. (SD =1 hr 12 min) and
M =11:53 p.m. (SD =1 hr 9 min), and mean wake times
between M =6:55 a.m. (SD =49 min), and M =7:55 a.m.
(SD =2 hr 13 min). In contrast, the weekend participants
reported mean falling asleep times of M =1:30 a.m. (SD =1
hr 46 min) for Friday night, and M =1:29 a.m. (SD =2 hr 19
min) for Saturday night, and mean wake times of M =9:05
a.m. (SD = 1 hr 21 min) for Saturday morning, and M =9:26
a.m. (SD =2 hr 16 min) for Sunday morning. It is
noteworthy that the mean fall asleep time of Sunday night,
and the mean wake time of Monday morning was slightly
later than other school nights/days. In sum, we found sleep
patterns indicating a DSP of about 2 hours which clearly
manifested itself during the weekend. Mean fall asleep and
wake up times are displayed in figure 2.
Stroop Task Data
Because in this paper we were interested in relating sleep
patterns to optimal performance we defined stroop
interference in relation to accuracy differences in the
congruent vs. incongruent trials. Although currently Stroop
interference is more frequently defined in terms of RT
differences, our interference measurement is not at all
unusual in Stroop research (see MacLeod, 1991),
The participants’ mean level of correct responses
was used to determine accuracy. For Test 1, morning
participants had an average accuracy of M = 67% (SD = 16)
and M = 72% (SD = 17) for Test 2. Afternoon participants

or afternoon, for both Test 1 (t (19) = 2.83; p < .02), and
Test 2 (t (19) = 2.63; p < .02). These results show that
participants tested in the morning experienced significantly
greater levels of Stroop interference than participants tested
in the afternoon.
The mean reaction times (RT) for Test 1 were M =
815.91ms (SD = 96.58) in the morning, and M = 902.97ms
(SD = 98.89) in the afternoon. The results for Test 2 show
RTs of M = 726.95ms (SD = 118.88) in the morning, and M
= 782.49ms (SD = 111.35) in the afternoon. Even after
outlier removal (±3SD from mean RT) there were no
significant and reliable differences in mean RTs between
morning and afternoon groups for both Test 1 and Test 2.
However, there was a significant difference between the
overall reaction times of Test 1 (M = 865.66ms, SD =
105.16ms) and Test 2 (M = 758.49ms, SD = 115.14ms)
indicating that both groups responded faster on the second
day of testing (t(19) = 4.68, p<.001).
Pre- and Post-Questionnaires
The questionnaires revealed that the mean level of perceived
task performance was significantly higher in the afternoon

1769

group than it was in the morning group (Mrank = 7.75 and
Mrank = 3.90 respectively; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signedranks test, z = -2.063, p<.05). It was also found that the
mean level of boredom was significantly higher in the AM
test group (Mrank = 8.42) than it was in the afternoon group
(Mrank = 4.58; z = -1.895, p<.05). There were no significant
differences found between AM and PM conditions in all
other control variables.
ERP Data
Our analyses focused on the critical window typically
involved in Stroop ERPs (300-600ms). We conducted
planned focused t –tests with Bonferroni confidence interval
adjustment. In what follows we summarize the most
relevant results, although we note that the effects are evident
by visual inspection in the example shown below (similar
patterns with smaller sizes were observed on across sites).

There was a significant difference in the level of ERP
amplitudes relative to congruent and incongruent stimuli
between 350 and 550ms (p <.05, Bonferroni t-interval) in

the afternoon but not in the morning group. Figure 3 shows
the best example at the central parietal electrode site. In the
afternoon, the processing of congruent stimuli was
accompanied with a higher level of ERP amplitudes. There
was a significant positive difference occurring between 500
and 800 ms. Congruent stimuli peaked at close to 500
amplitudes and remained fairly constant between 500 and
800 ms, while incongruent stimuli reached maximum peak
amplitudes at 500 ms and tapered off gradually. In contrast,
the morning group showed no significant differences
between congruent and incongruent trials.

Discussion
In the present study, the total hours of sleep obtained by
adolescent students did not significantly vary from
weekdays to weekends; however, these participants tended
to go to sleep and wake up approximately two hours later on
weekends than they did during the week. These results
support previous research that has shown that adolescents
have a natural preference for waking that is at odds with
early school start times (Wolfson, & Carskadon, 1998;
Wolfson, & Carskadon, 2003). This conflict seems to be
associated with relatively poor performance and lower
observed neural activity during complex cognitive tasks.
Because previous research has shown no reliable differences
between genders for the age range studied in the present
investigation we suggest that likely the present findings can
be generalized to both male and female adolescent students.
Consistent with the present findings, previous
studies have shown that adolescents’ cognitive performance
significantly improves in the afternoon as compared to the
morning (Wolfson, & Carskadon, 2003; Wright Jr., Hull,
Hughes, Ronda, & Czeisler, 2006; Yoon, May, & Hasher,
1999). The increase in cognitive performance of adolescents
as the day progresses may be attributed to the advent of the
wakeful stage of the circadian rhythm. When tested in the
afternoon, participants are naturally in a wakened stage
allowing them to cognitively perform at their optimal level
(Hasher, Zacks, & Rahhal, 1999; Wright Jr., Hull, Hughes,
Ronda, & Czeisler, 2006). Participants tested in the
morning appear to be experiencing symptoms of a
misaligned circadian rhythm which impair performance
reflected in a significantly greater level of observed Stroop
interference (May, & Hasher, 1998).
The differences in cognitive performance between
individuals tested in the afternoon and those tested in the
morning were also accompanied by substantial ERP
differences. P300 amplitudes, which have been found to
reflect the amount of attentional resources being employed
(Wickens, Kramer, Vanasse, & Donchin, 1983), were
significantly greater in the afternoon. These results invite
the interpretation that participants tested in the morning had
(or allocated) less attentional resources as compared to
participants tested in the afternoon. This difference may be
directly related to the misalignment of the adolescent
circadian rhythm as it correlates with the pattern reflected in
the self-reports from the sleep logs, and it would be

1770

compatible with the possibility that adolescents did not enter
into a wakeful stage until later in the early afternoon. Once
they were in a wakened stage, they were more attentive
(Doran, Van Dongen, & Dinges, 2001), and therefore
showed greater brain wave activity differentials concomitant
with the Stroop task.
The disparity in ERP amplitudes between
congruent and incongruent conditions occurring between
500ms and 800ms in the P.M. group could also be explained
by slow-route processing, which has been proposed to occur
during the incongruent condition of a Stroop task (Frith, &
Done, 1986). Slow-route processing is characterized by a
late positivity following the initial P300 peak (Ilan, &
Polich, 1999), which may also be the manifestation of other
subcomponents of the complex labeled the P300
(Falkenstein, Hohnsbein, & Hoormann, 1994; Rosler,
Borgstedt, & Sojka, 1985). Whether the late positivity
reflects slow-route processing or response selection
processes associated with the Stroop task, the lack of ERP
amplitude differences between the congruent and
incongruent conditions in the AM group seems to signify
the omission or attenuation of processes related to stimulus
evaluation and response selection.
Previous research has concluded that N200
amplitudes either reflect a top-down inhibitory mechanism
(Eimer, 1993) or conflict monitoring processes
(Nieuwenhuis, Yeung, Van Den Wildenberg, &
Ridderinkhof, 2003) that facilitate responses when
competing stimuli are present. Therefore, based on either of
these assumptions, our results suggest that the
comparatively less pronounced negative peaks observed in
the morning group at 200 ms are associated with a
diminished ability to appropriately respond during a task
involving competing stimuli.
The negative waves that occured around 800 ms in
both morning and afternoon groups may represent the
contingent negative variation (CNV) that occurs between a
warning signal and a second stimulus that demands a
response (Gomez, Marco, & Grau, 2003; Rohrbaugh,
Syndulko, & Lindsley, 1976). Therefore, the observed
pattern could be explained by participants preparing for the
next stimuli to be presented on the screen. The fact that
CNVs did not differ between the two groups is consistent
with the lack of differences between groups in the RT data.
Although there were no statistically significant
differences in RTs between morning and afternoon groups,
the overall mean RT of Test 1 was significantly greater than
that of Test 2, indicating that participants in both groups
responded faster during the Test 2 trials. It is reasonable to
suggest that as familiarity with the cognitive task increased,
the mean RT decreased; however, it is important to note that
this practice effect was not associated with any significant
change in accuracy or ERPs. These results suggest that
motor response confounds were not a major determinant of
the observed ERP patterns; rather, the observed ERP
patterns were likely related to actual latent cognitive
processes.

In addition to the P300 amplitude differences,
another possible indicator of an attentional impairment is
the elevated mean level of boredom observed in morning
participants.
Recent research has found a robust
relationship between attention related deficits and perceived
boredom. More specifically, an individual’s tendency to be
inattentive is a likely cause of proneness to boredom
(Carriere, Cheyne, & Smilek, 2008). In our study, morning
participants had a significantly elevated mean level of
boredom but no other significant differences in other
affective states; given this, it is possible that the elevated
mean level of boredom is a sign of an attentional
impairment related to poor cognitive performance.
The differences in cognitive performance between
morning and afternoon conditions were accompanied by a
significantly different pattern of ERP results that suggest a
cognitive deficiency in the morning condition. That is,
adolescents tested in the afternoon showed an appropriately
elevated attentional waveform, associated with better Stroop
performance, in response to incongruent stimuli.
In
comparison, adolescents tested in the morning showed no
significant ERP differences in response to congruent or
incongruent stimuli. Lack of ERP differences between
congruent and incongruent stimuli was found to be
associated with relatively poor Stroop performance (higher
interference). The observed relationship between morning
and afternoon test times, Stroop task performance, and
ERPs is further evidence that suggests adolescents are
cognitively performing at a sub-optimal level in the
morning.
The implications of our findings are particularly
relevant as they seem to illustrate the impact of early school
start times on cognitive performance. Previous studies have
found that students beginning school later in the day tended
to sleep longer and perform better academically than
students beginning school in the morning (Epstein, Chillag,
& Lavie, 1998; Wahlstrom, Wrobel, & Kubow, 1998).
However, the present study shows that there is a significant
difference in the cognitive performance of students from
morning to afternoon that is not exclusively dependent on
duration of sleep, as there were no significant differences in
the duration of sleep observed between our groups and the
range of sleep time per night of our sample was within the
range of the average healthy sleep (7 hrs 30 min to 9 hrs)
(Mitru, Millrood, & Mateika, 2002). These results suggest
that it is not necessarily the amount of sleep but the time of
day according to the natural circadian rhythm that is
relevant in determining, presumably, the quality of sleep
(the “good sleep”) and the optimal cognitive performance.
In contrast with what is suggested by some researchers and
educators, a counterintuitive implication of our findings is
that having students go to bed earlier in the evening – so
that they can obtain adequate amounts of sleep – will not
offset the cognitive impairment of a misaligned circadian
rhythm.
The results of this study, as well as previous
research, suggest that conventional school schedules could

1771

accommodate the shifted circadian rhythm of adolescents
for the purpose of increasing academic success. Based on
the difference between weekday and weekend rise time, a
delay in school start times by as little as 2 hours may be
enough to account for DSP; still, there are sociocultural and
logistic factors that prohibit widespread change in school
timing and scheduling. An alternative to changing school
operation times could be to rearrange students’ class
schedules to appropriately account for lower levels of
cognitive functioning in the morning. Having adolescents
attend gym class in the morning and mathematics in the
afternoon is an example of such an arrangement. Future
research should be conducted with regard to the impact of
possible interventions in this direction. Another related issue
deserving further study is the fact that the present findings
may be explained by the fact that the activities done in
weekends are different from done in the schooldays and that
forces adolescents to stay awake later and then compensate
by also waking up later. On this interpretation, school DSP
may be related to the more complex systemic
interdependence between school starting times and weekend
sleep times.
In conclusion, conflict between the naturally
delayed circadian rhythm of adolescents and early school
start times may explain poor performance of adolescents on
some cognitive activities carried out in the morning.
Furthermore, the poor cognitive performance of adolescents
observed in the morning is associated with distinctive ERP
patterns that suggest an attentional deficiency and a
tendency to process congruent and incongruent stimuli in a
similar manner. Therefore, the ERPs observed in this study
may be indicative of the cognitive impairment that
adolescents struggle with when performing mentally
demanding school activities in the morning.
