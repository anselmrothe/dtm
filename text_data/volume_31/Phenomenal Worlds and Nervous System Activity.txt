                              Abstract
   The epistemological situation of a single cell is considered.
   In chemotaxis, the relation between perception and action is
   found to be lawful and bidirectional. Consideration of the
   perception/action relation allows a characterization of the phe-
   nomenal world of the cell. This phenomenal world is grounded
   in perceptual distinctions that are relevant to the sustained vi-
   ability of the cell. Moving up the phylogenetic chain, this
   lawfulness, and its relation to the phenomenal world of ex-
   perience, is found to be essentially unchanged in multicellular
   organisms. Nervous systems add some innovation, in allow-
   ing distal responses and the non-linear combination of infor-
   mation, but from cell to human, the differentiation of the phe-
   nomenal world is found to arise from the lawfulness of the
   perception/action relation, which in turn reflects the biologi-
   cal constitution of the organism, and not a pre-given objec-
   tive world. This recognition suggests that rather than looking
   within the nervous system for representations of pre-given, ex-
   ternal, entities, one might do better to explore the fit between
   the function of the nervous system and the phenomenal, mean-          Figure 1: The hummingbird’s beak and the flower share a
