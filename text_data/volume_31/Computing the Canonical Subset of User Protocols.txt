Abstract: A common problem in cognitive science research is the large volume of behavioral protocol data recorded
during the execution of the tasks being studied. The analysis of these large data sets has often been a tedious
and time-consuming process, and automated analysis methods have been slow to develop. We have developed an
automated method to find canonical behaviors: a small subset of protocols that is most representative of the full
data set, providing a ”big picture” view of the data with as few protocols as possible. The method takes advantage
of recent algorithmic developments in computational vision, which we have adapted to the comparison of behavioral
protocols. No a priori model is required, just a similarity measure between pairs of behaviors. Initial experiments
show that canonical sets of web-browsing protocols found by our method compare well with those found by expert
human coders.
