Motivation effect of instructional manuals
Hideaki Shimada
Shinshu University
Abstract: Suppose that you grab an instructional manual, you may glance over some of the pages to determine
whether it looks interesting enough to read carefully. Such manuals generally consist of some particular modules
including captions (or titles), texts, illustrations, and pictures. This study examined whether each module enhances
motivation to read. Participants were required to glance over a page of a disaster prevention manual for two seconds
and to answer questions as to motivation (Did the page motivate you to read?) and self-efficacy (Did the page
look easy to understand?) on a five-point scale. Results showed that captions, illustrations, and pictures enhanced
motivation and that color graphics enhanced motivation more than black-and-white ones. Results of the structural
equation modeling analysis revealed that captions, illustrations, pictures, and color graphics had both direct and
indirect effects through self-efficacy to motivation but that captions had less direct effect.
