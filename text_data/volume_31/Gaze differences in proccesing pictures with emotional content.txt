Abstract: The International Affective Picture System (IAPS) consists of emotional pictures divided in three cat-
egories; valence, arousal and dominance. This base has been used for different electrophysiological research of
emotional processes with no consistent results. One possible explanation for this may be the difference in perceiving
pictures. In order to detect what subjects really look at on the presented pictures, an eye-tracking experiment with
12 emotional pictures divided into three categories by valence was conducted. Areas of interest were defined for each
picture in order to capture generalizations about how the participants direct their gaze. While perceiving an image,
main elements which can define our fixation and exploration on a presented picture are luminosity, color, edges and
contrast. In this research black and white pictures were compared with the same pictures in color. Results are
interpreted in terms of fixations, saccades and defined areas of interest.
