                          Introduction                                     Given that adults use a semantic representation to operate
   The positive integers, or natural numbers, have ready
perceptual referents; for example, six divided by three can
be materialized in the world as six cookies shared between
three people. The structural properties of natural numbers
(e.g., ordinality, cardinality, magnitude) can be gleaned
from applying numbers to physical situations (Griffin, Case,
& Siegler, 1994). This may help explain why people have
an analog representation of natural numbers, as indicated by
the symbolic distance effect (Moyer & Landauer, 1967) and
more recent brain evidence (Piazza, Izard, Pinel, Le Bihan,
& Dehaene, 2004).
   In contrast, negative integers are abstract entities that do
not map readily to tangible things; negative three cookies
are hard to imagine, and a negative times a negative is
typically handled symbolically in school curricula.
Historically, negative numbers were considered fictitious
even when effectively used in calculations (Schwarz, Kohn,
& Resnick, 1993/1994). Schwarz, et al. (1993/1994) say,
“It was only in the 19th century that negative numbers
emerged as directed magnitudes (e.g., in the domain of
electricity) and that the set of integers was axiomatically
defined in such a way as to give negatives a symmetric
status to that of positives.”
   The full set of integers includes greater quantitative
structure than the natural numbers; for example, it includes
zero as an identity; and it is possible for quantities to exhibit
symmetry. How do people represent the increased structure
of integers?                                                          Figure 1: Protocol for bisection task. A) Study 1. B) Study 2.
