   In summary, this study shows that when units are
marked, the chunking models provide reliable
assumptions concerning the nature of the representations
developed during learning. However, when no cues are
provided in order to guide the chunking processes,
performance reflects sensitivity to the strength of the
transitional probabilities and seems also to depend on
attentional factors. Further modeling studies are needed
in order to test the ability of the SRN and PARSER
models to account for the experimental results described
in our study.
