following questions would need to be obtained before this
relationship can be seriously entertained. First, how
common were refixations in the task? If this behavior was
relatively rare, then even if it was used as a rehearsal tool it
may not meaningfully affect memory performance. Second,
are these refixations patterned or simply the product of
random oculomotor inspection? We will address this
question by comparing the actual refixation rate to a chance
baseline, and by looking for evidence of systematic patterns                b                                  2

object improve recognition accuracy for that object later

constrained to 18 positions, creating the appearance of a
random arrangement of items on a surface. Multiple trials
for a given scene type were created by randomly pairing

   Observers studied scenes in preparation for a recognition
test. At test a spatial probe would be presented and they
would have to indicate the object from the study scene that
appeared at a probed location. Observers were therefore
required to encode from the study scene information about
both the identity and location of each object.
