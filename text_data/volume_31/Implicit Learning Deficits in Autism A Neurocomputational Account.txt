   Some insight might be gained from the neuropsychological
literature involving the SRTT. Specifically, deficits in tasks
assessing implicit learning have been linked to damage to the
cerebellum. This is intriguing, as there is ample evidence of
cerebellar abnormalities in people with autism (Courchesne
et al., 1994). However, other tasks traditionally associated
with the cerebellum, such as judgment of timing, show no
differences between people with autism and normally devel-
oping controls (Mostofsky et al., 2000). Recently, evidence
has emerged suggesting that PFC and the basal ganglia may
be important players in implicit learning as well (Matsumoto,
Hanakawa, Maki, Graybiel, & Kimura, 1999; Pascual-Leone,
Wassermann, Grafman, & Hallett, 2004). It is this latter
connection that we will pursue, here, using an established
computational model of the SRTT to investigate the possibil-
ity that PFC/DA abnormalities may give rise to the implicit                  Figure 1: Network Diagram of SRTT Model

stricting the updating of the PFC in this manner makes the
temporally extended information normally contained within
this layer much less reliable, making the learning of complex
sequential structures much more difficult for the network.
    The measure of interest in the SRTT is the response time
of the participants throughout the training blocks. In or-
der to compare model performance to human reaction times,
Cleeremans et al. (1991) translated network outputs into a
probability distribution over the four buttons using a Luce
choice ratio (Luce, 1963) and then linearly scaled the error
between this prediction distribution and the actual outcome
(i.e., the next button illuminated) to produce a modeled re-
sponse time. This procedure assumes that there is a linear
increase in response time with prediction error. We used this
method, as well, introducing three free parameters for fitting              Figure 2: Scaled Model Results & Human Behavioral Data
