   The students were required to blog at the pace of one post
per lecture: there were two lectures per week. A typical post
was 1 or 2 paragraphs in length. The students were also
required to read and comment on other contributions to the
blog-o-sphere. The student’s co-blogging work counted for
35% of each student’s grade.
   The focus of the analysis presented in this paper is on the
co-blogging work that the students did during the time the
class read three books that were on the syllabus. The students
wrote short papers on two of these books. There were nine
lectures on these three books, so if every student completed
his assigned work fully there would have been 9 × 25 blog
