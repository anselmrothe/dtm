tested either upright or inverted (Yarmey, 1971) or tested
from different viewpoints than study (Valentine & Bruce,
1986).
An apparent exception to these robust findings was
recently reported by Loftus, Oberg and Dillon (2004). They
found a weak and barely reliable FIE as measured by the
standard interaction definition when unfamiliar faces were
studied upright or inverted but all tested upright. This design
was utilized to examine Valentine’s (1988) assertion that to
produce an FIE “the orientation of the inspection series does
not appear to be critical” (p.474). Indeed Loftus et al.
concluded that an FIE would only emerge when inversion is
present at the same time as memory retrieval.

Abstract
The Face Inversion Effect (FIE), the finding that inversion
disproportionately affects face recognition, is one of the
primary pieces of evidence suggesting that faces are encoded
in a qualitatively different way to other stimuli (e.g., along
configural as well as featural dimensions). However, when
Loftus, Oberg and Dillon (2004) tested the FIE using statetrace analysis (Bamber, 1979), they found evidence for a one
dimensional encoding of unfamiliar faces when inversion
only occurred during the study phase of a recognition memory
test. We report experimental results that replicate Loftus et
al.’s findings and rule out several potential problems with
their experimental manipulations and state-trace analysis.

Dimensions of the Face Inversion Effect

The Face Inversion Effect

The FIE has become one of the primary pieces of evidence
suggesting that face processing is qualitatively different
from the processing of other visual stimuli, that is, that face
processing is “special”. While the inversion effect is taken
to indicate that there is a general factor affecting the
processing of all mono-oriented stimuli, the FIE suggests
that there is an additional face-specific factor. It has been
suggested that the two factors (or dimensions) underlying
the FIE might be two types of information, namely featural
and configural information. Featural information is common
to all mono-oriented stimuli and refers to the isolated
features that can be specified without reference to other
parts of the object (Rakover, 2002). Configural information,
in contrast, is mostly or only available for faces, and at least
three different types have been identified (Maurer et al.,
2002). The first type, holistic information, captures the
overall look of a face (Leder & Bruce, 2000), while the
remaining two types refer to the spatial relations between
features. First-order information refers to the arrangements
of features that define a face (Rhodes, Brake & Atkinson,
1993) and second-order information refers to the distances
between internal features (Diamond & Carey, 1986).
While both featural and configural information are
affected by inversion, it is usually found that inversion has a
greater effect on the availability of configural information
(e.g., Leder & Bruce, 2000; Rhodes et al., 1993). Hence it is
suggested that upright faces are processed via both featural
and configural information, whereas only featural
information is available for inverted faces (Carey &
Diamond, 1977). Recently, Barton, Keenan and Bass (2001)

There has been a longstanding interest in determining how
and why the perception and memory for faces is “special”.
Humans are expert at recognizing a familiar face after only
a glance, when viewed under poor lighting or from a
distance and even when seen from a novel viewpoint or in
an unfamiliar context. However, our memory is much worse
when the faces are unfamiliar (Hancock, Bruce & Burton,
2000) and even more so when they are presented upsidedown (Maurer, LeGrand & Mondloch, 2002).
The Inversion Effect refers to the robust finding that
perception and memory performance for mono-oriented
objects (i.e., objects usually viewed in a specific orientation)
is strongly disadvantaged by inversion. The Face Inversion
Effect (FIE) refers to the finding that this inversion effect is
disproportionately stronger for faces compared to other
mono-oriented stimuli. The FIE is traditionally measured by
an interaction comparing the size of the inversion effects for
face and mono-oriented control stimuli. It was first reported
by Yin (1969), who found an FIE on recognition memory
accuracy even when control stimuli (e.g., houses) were
matched as closely as possible to faces in terms of
complexity, familiarity and difficulty in applying a verbal
label. Since Yin’s initial demonstration, the FIE in
recognition memory has been shown to be a robust
phenomenon that has been replicated numerous times and
with many procedural variations. Most of these studies have
followed Yin’s original design where items were studied
and tested in the same orientation. However, an FIE has also
been observed when all items were studied upright but

suggested a more graded view whereby the rate at which
both featural and configural information can be extracted is
reduced by inversion and that this rate of decrease is
stronger for configural information. This graded view also
leaves open the possibility that, if given sufficient time,
participants may be able to extract some configural
information from inverted faces.

more than one dimension (i.e., all points could not be joined
by a single monotonic line) when the faces were famous
(experiment 2; in both cases orientation was manipulated
only at study). This evidence led Loftus et al. to conclude
that “the FIE emerges when familiar faces are retrieved
from memory, but does not emerge when unfamiliar faces
are encoded for subsequent recognition” (p.860).

Identifying Underlying Dimensions

Experiment

Evidence for the FIE, and hence the existence of two
underlying dimensions for face encoding, is traditionally
provided by a dissociation quantified by an interaction test
of an accuracy measure. However, such dissociation logic
has been shown to be potentially flawed for measures such
as accuracy, which can be subject to floor and ceiling effects
(e.g., Dunn & Kirsner, 1998; Loftus, 1978). Loftus et al.
(2004) proposed state-trace analysis (Bamber, 1979) as a
remedy for this flaw. State-trace analysis provides a
rigorous method for determining whether a single
dimension (i.e., a single latent variable or psychological
process) is able to explain the joint effect of two or more
experimental factors. Moreover, there is general agreement
that state-trace analysis avoids the caveats on traditional
dissociation analysis (Newell & Dunn, 2008).
State-trace analysis is most easily explained with
reference to a state-trace plot, a scatterplot showing the
covariation of two factors, a state factor and a dimensional
factor. The state factor defines the axes of the plot. Each
point on the plot is defined by a pair of dependent variable
values, one for each level of the state factor. Here we use
the stimulus type (houses or faces) as the state factor and
accuracy as the dependent variable. The dimensional factor,
which usually also has two levels, has the potential to
differentially affect the dimensionality of the processes
determining responses for each state. In our case the
dimensional factor is study orientation (upright or inverted)
which can potentially cause face processing to change from
two to one dimensional.
Dimensionality is determined by whether points on the
state-trace plot can be joined by a single monotonic (always
increasing or decreasing) function. As at least three points
are required to possibly violate monotonicity a third factor,
called the trace factor, is usually introduced. This factor
must itself have a monotonic effect (i.e., not change
dimensionality) and is used to sweep out a “trace” (i.e., set
of points) within each level of the dimensional factor.
Critically, these traces must overlap for at least one state,
otherwise monotonicity will not be violated even if the
dimensional factor does change dimensionality. Following
Loftus et al. (2004) we used study duration, which can
reasonably be assumed to have a monotonic effect on
accuracy, as the trace factor.
Using state-trace analysis, Loftus et al. (2004) found
evidence for a single dimension (i.e., all points could be
joined by a single monotonic line) in accuracy averaged
over subjects when they examined memory for unfamiliar
faces (experiment 1). However, they found evidence for

Loftus et al. (2004) noted a caveat to their results: they used
pictures of famous people but Identikit (drawn) faces as
their unfamiliar face stimuli. There is evidence to suggest
that configural information is reduced for line drawings
compared to photographs of faces (Leder, 1999), and so
their use of Identikit faces may have weakened or even
removed the FIE in their experiment with unfamiliar faces.
Furthermore, differences in stimulus quality from control
images may have been an issue as they used photographs as
their control stimuli. The current experiment addressed
these issues by using photographs in all conditions.
We noted further potential caveats on Loftus et al.’s
(2004) results. First, their experiment used the same very
brief study durations (17-250ms) for both upright and
inverted stimuli. It is possible that brief presentation by
itself, causes a failure of configural or holistic encoding as
extracting such information is more time consuming than
extracting featural information (Palermo & Rhodes, 2002;
Valentine, 1988). This caveat is particularly likely for
unfamiliar faces, which are more demanding to process than
familiar faces, and so they may be more affected by brief
presentation. It is also likely to have particularly affected
their state-trace results as there was only a very minimal
overlap between the traces for upright and inverted
conditions (i.e., only the 17ms upright condition overlapped
the inverted data). If 17ms were too short to allow extraction
of configural information for an upright face the state-trace
plot would be monotonic even if a separate configural
dimension existed for the longer study durations.
We addressed these caveats in complimentary ways using
two between-subjects conditions. Our first condition closely
replicated Loftus et al.’s (2004) experiment 1, so will be
referred to as the Test Upright condition. It differed in that
we used longer durations for inverted (i.e., 267-2048ms)
than upright (i.e., 33-267ms) stimuli. These values were
chosen based on a pilot experiment in order to maximize
overlap between upright and inverted traces (i.e., the longer
durations for inverted than upright stimuli counteracts the
deleterious effect of inversion on accuracy).
We also attempted to use generally longer study durations
but were limited in our ability to do so because the Test
Upright design confounds orientation with the encoding
specificity effect. The encoding specificity effect refers to
the improvement in memory when study and test conditions
match (Tulving & Thomson, 1973). It is a robust and strong
effect that has been found to be equal or greater in
magnitude than the inversion effect (Rakover & Teucher,
1997). The confounding occurs in the Test Upright design

686

because upright items are studied and tested in the same
orientation, and so receive a benefit from study-test match
as well as from the inversion effect. Inverted items
mismatch and so are disadvantaged not only by the
inversion effect but also by the encoding specificity effect.
As a result, very large differences in study duration are
required to compensate for the large deleterious effects on
memory for inverted stimuli. Practical limitations did not
allow us to use durations much longer than 2s for inverted
stimuli, so we had to use shorter study durations for upright
stimuli.
Our second condition, which we call the Test Inverted
condition, attempted to address this issue by testing all items
inverted. Pilot testing showed that the study-test match
advantage for inverted study stimuli in this design almost
exactly counteracted the inversion effect. Hence, we were
able to use the same longer set of study durations (2672048ms) for both orientation conditions.

background with white font. Prospective and retrospective
confidence judgments were made using the computer
keyboard with the keys “z”, “x”, “.”, “/” labeled “1”, “2”,
“3” and “4” respectively.

Procedure
Testing sessions began with the experimenter reading
through the instructions displayed on the participants’
screen. During these instructions it was emphasized that the
orientation of a stimulus at study and test was irrelevant to
their recognition decision. That is, that they should respond
“old” even if the test item was studied in a different
orientation. Participants then completed two half-length
practice blocks, one using faces and one using houses with
order counterbalanced over participants.
The start of a study list was marked by the warning
“Prepare for study. Place your fingers on the keys”
displayed for 2000ms. For each study trial a centrally placed
fixation cross was displayed for 1000ms followed by a
300ms blank screen. The target stimulus was then presented
for its designated duration following which participants had
a maximum of 2500ms to rate their prospective confidence
by responding to the question “How confident are you that
you will remember this image later on?” using a four-point
scale (1=“definitely no”, 2=“probably no”, 3=“probably
yes” and 4=“definitely yes”). As in Loftus et al. (2004), the
purpose of this prospective confidence judgment was to
encourage participants to attend to the stimulus and the data
from this response was not considered further.
After the study list a 300ms blank screen was followed by
the warning “Prepare for testing. Place your fingers on the
keys”, which appeared for 2000ms. Each test trial was
preceded by a 300ms blank screen followed by the test
stimulus and retrospective confidence rating scale. The test
image was centrally positioned above the question “How
confident are you that you have seen this image earlier?”
and again participants responded using a four-point rating
scale where 1=“definitely new”, 2=“probably new”,
3=“probably old”, and 4=“definitely old”. The next trial
commenced as soon as the participant responded or if the
5000ms time limit expired. For the entire length of the study
and test lists the words “STUDY” and “TEST” were
displayed respectively in the top left corner of the screen.
Following practice trials, participants received feedback
on the number of times they used each confidence level. The
purpose of this feedback was to encourage participants to
use the full confidence scale. No feedback regarding
accuracy was provided. Participants then commenced the
main experiment, which consisted of 32 study-test cycles
(16 using face stimuli and 16 using houses). The order of
testing face and house stimuli was identical to the practice
phase order, such that faces were tested first for half of the
participants and houses tested first for the remaining
participants. Each study list included 16 images (8 presented
upright and 8 inverted), while test lists included 24 images
(16 previously studied and 8 new). A 10second break

Method
Participants
Participants (75 in Test Upright and 65 in the Test Inverted
conditions) were recruited from members of the wider
community with the only restriction on participation that
they had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were
comfortable completing a computer-based task. No
demographics were recorded and participants did not
receive incentives.

Stimuli
Stimuli were black and white bitmap images (120x105
pixels) displayed at twice their original size. A total of 384
face stimuli were sourced from the FERET database
(Phillips, Wechsler, Huang & Rauss, 1998), excluding
images with glasses, averted gaze, distinctive facial
expressions or natural or photographic blemishes. The faces
were divided into homogenous blocks based on race and
gender. In total there were 144 African American and 240
Caucasian, with half male and half female. An additional 12
Caucasian male faces were used in a practice phase.
A total of 384 house stimuli (with an additional 12 for
practice) were sourced using real estate websites and
internet search engines. Houses were excluded if located in
New South Wales in order to reduce potential familiarity
effects given that participants were drawn from this region.
Pilot testing revealed significantly greater accuracy for
house than face stimuli. Participant feedback suggested that
certain house characteristics made them distinctive within
the context of a particular study list. Therefore, house
stimuli were presented in homogenous blocks based on their
most distinctive feature (e.g., drive-way, fence, etc.).

Apparatus
Testing was completed either at individual computer
terminals equipped with 17” LCD monitors or using laptop
computers. All stimuli and text were presented on a black

effect for houses) and the results of associated t-tests.
In the Test Upright design, 267ms was the only common
duration for upright and inverted items. The FIE was,
therefore, tested by a two-way (orientation by stimulus type)
ANOVA using only the 267ms data. Accuracy was reliably
greater for houses (M=0.32) than faces (M=0.26),
F(1,74)=15.97, p<.001 and for upright (M=0.41) than
inverted (M=0.18), F(1,74)=225.88, p<.001. The FIE
interaction test was marginally significant F(1,74)=3.21,
p=.08, but as shown in Table 2 the effect was in the opposite
direction (a greater inversion effect for houses than faces).

occurred at the end of each cycle and a 5minute break
occurred after 16 cycles.

Results
Overall, participants failed to respond on 0.31% of trials. A
further 0.64% of test responses were excluded for being
faster than 150ms. Accuracy was defined using Loftus et
al.’s (2004) “p” measure. This measure was obtained by first
transforming the 1-4 confidence rating (CR) by (CR-1)/3,
then averaging to produce for each participant what Loftus
et al. refer to as a hit rate (HR) and false alarm rate (FA),
where: p=(HR-FA)/(1-FA).
We first report a preliminary analysis to ensure the longer
durations used in the present study were able to replicate
Loftus et al.’s (2004) finding that accuracy was linear as a
function of the logarithm of study duration. One-way
repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on the effects
of the logarithm of study duration for upright and inverted
houses and faces in each condition, with polynomial trend
analysis. This was followed up by two-way factorial
ANOVAs examining the effect of stimulus type (house vs.
face) and its interaction with duration.
Linear trends were all highly significant (p<.001) and
accounted for almost all of the variance in accuracy (see
Table 1 and Figure 1). No quadratic or cubic trends
approached significance, with the exception of inverted
faces (quadratic trend, p=.04) and upright faces (cubic trend,
p=.03) in the Test Upright design.

duration for (a) Test Upright and (b) Test Inverted
conditions with Loftus and Masson (1994) standard errors.

In the Test Upright condition accuracy was greater for
houses than faces for both inverted (MH=0.30, MF=0.23),
F(1,74)=21.66, p<.001, and upright items (MH=0.31,
MF=0.26), F(1,74)=12.23, p=.001. Accuracy also increased
more quickly with study duration for houses than faces. This
effect was reliable for upright, F(3,222)=3.67, p=.01, but
not inverted, p=.27. Similarly, in the Test Inverted
condition, accuracy was higher for houses than faces for
both inverted (MH=0.34, MF=0.23), F(1,67)=57.77, p<.001,
and upright images (MH=0.33, MF=0.24), F(1,64)=51.21,
p<.001. The stronger effect of study duration for houses
than faces was reliable for both inverted, F(3,192)=5.79,
p=.001, and upright, F(2.7,173.8)=3.71, p=.02 (using a
Huynh-Feldt correction to degrees of freedom).
We tested for the FIE as traditionally defined by the
interaction between orientation and stimulus type. In each
condition the corresponding ANOVA used only study
durations that were common to upright and inverted
conditions. Table 2 also shows, for each duration, estimates
of the inversion effect (i.e., difference between upright and
inverted) for faces and houses, the corresponding FIE

The Test Inverted condition was fully factorial, so the FIE
was examined using a three-way ANOVA that included a
duration factor with all four levels. Accuracy was again
reliably greater for houses (M=0.33) than faces (M=0.23),
F(1,64)=73.49, p<.001. However, there was no reliable
difference in accuracy for upright (M=0.29) and inverted
items (M=0.28), p=.48. An overall FIE of 0.017 was

upright conditions for the two shortest study durations and
in the Test Inverted condition they were between the middle
two durations. The second method involved adding standard
errors appropriate for a within-subjects comparison (Loftus
& Masson, 1994) to the plots. This aids a visual assessment
of whether an inversion is likely to be reliable. For the Test
Inverted design neither inversion appears reliable as the
standard error bars for the inverted points overlap markedly.
This is also clearly the case for the lower left pair in the Test
Upright condition and even for the other pair, where the
inversion is more marked, a decrease for inverted houses
and an increase for upright houses of less than one standard
error would be sufficient to remove the inversion.

observed, but the corresponding interaction was not reliable,
p=.24, and, as shown in Table 2, neither were the FIE
estimates at any individual duration.
State-trace plots for each condition are shown in Figure 2.
Results for upright study are joined, as are points for
inverted study, and these lines are clearly monotonically
increasing, consistent with the requirement that the trace
factor have a monotonic effect. The plots also show
excellent overlap between the two traces in both conditions.

Discussion

We replicated Loftus et al.’s (2004) finding of a linear
increase in accuracy for study durations up to one quarter of
a second and extended this result for durations up to two
seconds. The fact that duration effects showed no
discontinuity suggests that there is no abrupt change in
strategy associated with longer study presentations (i.e., no
switch from featural to configural processing). Given
evidence that duration and inversion have similar memory
effects (Valentine, 1998) the result is consistent with Barton
et al.’s (2001) suggestion that inversion does not cause a
sudden change in encoding but rather reduces the rate at
which featural and configural information are extracted.
Like Loftus et al. (2004) we found little evidence for an
FIE using the traditional interaction measure. Although their
tests were reliable, the magnitude of their effect was very
small (0.042) and was not much different from our results
for some durations, which were not statistically reliable. As
Loftus et al. (2004) demonstrated in an extensive set of
simulations, such inconstancy in the interaction measure of
the FIE is to be expected. In contrast, our state-trace results
were largely consistent with Loftus et al.’s, although they
observed no inversion (ρ=1) whereas we obtained some
weak evidence for the occasional inversion. Likely this was
due to the much greater overlap between traces in our
experiment, which increased the likelihood of chance
inversions.
These results are not only consistent with Loftus et al.’s
(2004) assertion about the ineffectiveness of study inversion
for unfamiliar faces, but also further strengthens this
conclusion. First, it shows the prediction is not dependent
on the orientation at which items are tested, as our statetrace results were essentially the same when all items were
tested upright and when all were tested inverted. Second, the
Test Inverted condition extended Loftus et al.’s finding to
much longer study durations where it is unlikely that
insufficient study time was available to perform configural
encoding. Finally, through the use of photographic stimuli,
the current experiment showed that Loftus et al.’s finding
cannot be attributed to their use of Identikit faces.
Despite results consistent with Loftus et al.’s (2004)
conclusion that the FIE occurs only when recognizing faces
already stored in memory, this conclusion is surprising

Following Loftus et al. (2004) we examined the
monotonicity of the overall plots in two ways. First, we
calculated Spearman’s ρ, a measure of rank order
correlation. Where for ρ=1 perfect monotonicity holds (i.e.,
the same ordering for points on both axes). Both conditions
had the same value of ρ which is close to one because there
were only two inversions in the order for each axis. In the
Test Upright condition these were between the inverted and

given the widely held view that the “face inversion effect is
really a perceptual phenomenon rather than a memory
phenomenon” (Freire, Lee & Symons 2000; p.160). An
alternate explanation more compatible with this view would
be possible if participants can strategically use the results of
configural processing. That is, if configural encoding is not
an automatic process but rather that participants will utilize
it only when they know it will improve performance for all
items. For example, if an item was encoded using purely
featural information (e.g., studied inverted) it might be
detrimental to use configural information at test, as
suggested by the encoding specificity effect; if only featural
information is available from study, performance would
benefit from a matched (featural) test encoding but hurt by a
mismatched (configural) encoding.
Participants in the Test Inverted condition may have relied
completely on featural information because configural
information at test was not available (or was too difficult to
extract) from the inverted test traces. In contrast,
participants in the Test Upright condition had configural
information available but may have instead relied on
featural information because they had no way of knowing
for which items the configural information would be
detrimental (i.e., those studied inverted). In future research
we will test this possibility by modifying testing in the Test
Upright condition so participants are given separate test lists
in which they are informed of an item’s study orientation
(assuming it is old). In this situation, the use of configural
information for test items studied upright could be
beneficial, in which case the strategic hypothesis predicts a
non-monotonic state-trace plot.
