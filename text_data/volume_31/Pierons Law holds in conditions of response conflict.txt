by the Stroop task.
   Extending existing models of the Stroop task
Although a pattern of additive factors in the experimental data
can be trivially fitted with a simplistic two-stage model it is
also appropriate to ask if existing, continuous processing —
i.e. ‘single stage’ — models of the Stroop task can fit the
data. We show that they can. Our starting point is the Co-
hen, Dunbar & McClelland (1990) model of the Stroop task.
This model uses the diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) as a re-
sponse mechanism to arbitrate between competing responses.
The ‘front-end’ of the model is built out of the simple artifi-
cial neurons of the PDP tradition (Rumelhart, McClelland, &
PDP Research Group, 1986). This early part of the model per-
forms stimulus-response translation, reconciling the word and
colour information of the stimulus, the attentional demands of
                                                                     Figure 5: Single stage model with locked inputs: simulated

weights these factors in converting the stimulus inputs into
the common metric of evidence in favour of the responses.
