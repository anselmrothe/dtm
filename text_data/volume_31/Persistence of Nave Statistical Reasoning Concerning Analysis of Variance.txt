farther than any of the normal golf balls, albeit by no more

significant.
   The picture for statistics instructors is not completely
bleak. Students do possess a good intuitive ability to detect
and utilize between-group variability. The problem may be
that this ability is too good. Students arrive in class with a
strong tendency to focus on between-group differences and
place too much emphasis on large differences. While it is
easy for students to understand that between-group
differences are (at least partially) due to the effect of the
independent variable, it appears more difficult for them to
understand that some of the observed between-group
difference may be due to other random effects (i.e., error in
measurement). As such, statistics educators may want to
determine how to shift attention toward the relative
importance of within-group variation. One strategy may be
to encourage a more intensive focus on the actual sources of
within group variation – i.e., help students understand why
numbers within a given condition might vary and how these
sources of variation signify unreliability in measurement
that could lead to some of the observed between-group
difference. Although we are sure that statistics instructors
already make an effort to illustrate the difference between
within- and between-group variability, our studies show that
the standard approach is often not very effective.
   Future studies will seek to pinpoint the source of the bias
described in this study, with the goal of developing
pedagogical strategies for overcoming it. It may be that
students simply need to get a “feel” for analyzing variance
without even thinking in a statistical sense.
