Children were presented with one relational target
(either ABA or BAA structure) on the box. The same
target card was used for all testing trials. Then, they
were given two choice cards, one was a relational
match and the other did not provide a match. The
spatial location of the choice cards on each trial was
randomly determined. Trials were presented in a
series, with 4 test trials for a target card that
progressed from less to more abstract relational
matches as indicated in Figure 2. There were 7
unique testing choice cards (constructed from
different shapes, colors and sizes) tested twice for a
total of 7 by 2 repetitions (or 14 judgments per child).
The order of target cards (either ABA or BAA) was
randomly determined.

us that children in both cultures – at least with simple
stimuli – understand the task and can apprehend the
relations. This sets up the goal for Experiment 2; to
challenge children’s relational reasoning by making
the constituent objects more complex and known
kinds. Does this manipulation have a greater effect on
children from the United States than from Japan?

                                                            studies have shown that adults from eastern culture

                                                            Thus it is possible that the origins of these differences
