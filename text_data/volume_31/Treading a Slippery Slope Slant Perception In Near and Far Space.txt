Abstract: Hills are judged steeper with verbal measures than with motor measures. Previous studies of slope
estimation have used relatively long distances. Since some neurons in premotor and parietal cortex respond only to
objects within arms reach, this study was designed to compare verbal and motor estimates of slopes in near and far
space. Verbal estimates greatly overestimated slopes (distance & surface experiment)
