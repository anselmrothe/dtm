Abstract

Many scientists over the past century have described
psychological constructs that overlap with Einstellung. For
example, constructs like “habit” (James, 1890), “direction”
(Maier, 1931), “perseveration” (Kendig, 1937), “set”
(Gibson, 1941; Wiley, 1998), “functional fixedness”
(Duncker, 1945), “deep attractor state” (Thelen & Smith,
1994), “mindlessness” (Langer, 2000), “strong
representation” (Munakata, 2001), “entrenchment” (Zevin
& Seidenberg, 2002), and “attentional inertia” (Diamond &
Kirkham, 2005) all reflect the overarching view that the
cognitive system tends to resist change, even in the face of
external pressure to change.
The classic example of change resistance is performance
in Luchins’s water jar studies (Luchins, 1942, 1946;
Luchins & Luchins, 1950, see also Bugelski & Huff, 1962;
Cunningham, 1965; McGraw & McCullers, 1979;
McKelvie, 1984). In these studies, participants were
presented with three jars (A, B, and C), each of which held a
certain amount of water. The goal was to determine how the
jars could be used to obtain a designated amount of water.
Both children and adults who practiced several “set”
problems that required the same complicated strategy (e.g.,
A – B – 2C) often persisted in using that strategy on target
problems that could be solved by a much simpler strategy.
They did so even when the more complicated strategy did
not lead to a correct solution. These participants were said to
be operating according to an Einstellung, or mental set.
They rigidly applied their knowledge of the practiced
strategy, which apparently made them less open to
generating alternative strategies. Participants who did not
initially practice the complicated strategy used the simpler
strategy on the target problems.
Despite the fact that Einstellung and other change
resistant behaviors have been demonstrated across a wide
variety of participant groups and on a wide variety of
problem solving tasks, one key question has been largely
ignored—how does the amount of practice with the initial
strategy relate to the strength of a problem solver’s
resistance to change? This question is the focus of the
present study.

Luchins’s (1942) classic Einstellung (mental set)
phenomenon has been demonstrated across a wide variety of
samples and problem solving tasks. However, it is unclear
how increased practice with the initial “set” affects
subsequent performance. Although Luchins anecdotally
reported no effect of increased practice with set problems,
current theories would suggest otherwise. In this study, we
varied the number of set problems (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40) in the
water jar task and examined the effects on subsequent
performance. Results suggest that problem-solving flexibility
decreases linearly as the number of set problems increases.
Contrary to the predictions of a dual-process theory, we found
no evidence of a U-shaped association between flexibility and
number of set problems, at least not in the range of 0-40
problems. These findings highlight the need for further
investigation into the situations in which practice and
automatization lead to change resistance versus reflection and
conscious control.

Almost everyone is familiar with the popular phrase
“practice makes perfect.” The principle behind the saying is
intuitive—the more you practice something, the better you
should become at it. Indeed, the assumption that practice
makes perfect underlies many of our educational practices.
Students in mathematics classes drill their arithmetic facts
over and over, and those learning a musical instrument are
encouraged to spend hours practicing each week.
However, practice may also come with undesirable
consequences. Research has shown that practice with a
single strategy can have a negative effect when people are
presented with new problems that cannot be solved with the
practiced strategy (e.g., Bilaic, McLeod, & Gobet, 2008;
Chen, 1999; Diamond & Kirkham, 2005; Knoblich,
Ohlsson, Haider, & Rhenius, 1999; Langer, 2000; Luchins
& Luchins, 1950; Luchins, 1946; Luchins, 1942; McNeil &
Alibali, 2005; Munakata, 2001; Wiley, 1998). This
phenomenon, termed the “Einstellung” phenomenon by
Luchins (1942), refers to people’s tendency to use
previously learned and practiced strategies even after those
strategies cease to be efficient or effective.

Method

The absence of previous attempts to address this question
may be due to the assumption that it has already been
answered. Indeed, Luchins (1942) specifically stated that the
number of water jar problems solved with the initial strategy
(beyond 1) does not affect participants’ tendency to apply
the mental set. However, he never provided any systematic
evidence to support this claim.
Despite Luchins’s claim, many theories suggest that
participants should become less flexible as the number of set
problems increases (e.g., Langer, 2000; Diamond &
Kirkham, 2005; Thelen & Smith, 1994; Munakata, 2001;
Wiley, 1998; Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002). For example,
according to Munakata’s graded representations account,
behavior is determined by the strength of the underlying
representations, with stronger representations exerting more
control over behavior. This account suggests that repeated
practice with a single strategy strengthens the
representations required for that strategy, making it more
likely to be used again in the future. This prediction seems
somewhat intuitive—as practice with a given strategy
increases, the likelihood of using an alternative strategy
decreases.
However, intuition is not always correct, and some dualprocess theories predict a nonmonotonic relationship
between the number of set problems and participants’
subsequent flexibility (e.g., Marcovitch, Zelazo, &
Schmuckler, 2002). For example, according to the
hierarchical competing systems account, problem solving
behavior is governed not only by a response-based system
that operates according to low-level learning mechanisms,
but also by a conscious representational system that has the
potential to override the response-based system (Marcovitch
et al. 2002; Marcovitch & Zelazo, 2006; cf. Crowley,
Shrager, & Siegler, 1997). According to this account, a
problem solver’s flexibility in the water jar task should
decrease gradually as the number of set problems increases,
until it reaches an asymptote. Once the asymptote has been
reached, increased practice with the set problems should
lead to automatization, which in turn should increase the
likelihood that the problem solver will be able to reflect on
the task and override the practiced strategy when it is
beneficial to do so. Based on this account, one would expect
an initial decrease in flexibility as practice with the initial
strategy increases, followed by an increase in flexibility as
the conscious representational system begins to exert more
influence over problem solving behavior (i.e., a U-shaped
function).
Does problem solvers’ flexibility decrease linearly as a
function of the number of set problems, or is the association
U-shaped? The answer has yet to be determined. Although
many studies have shown that practice with an initial
strategy hinders subsequent flexibility on water jar
problems, no experimentally sound attempts have been
made to manipulate the amount of practice participants
engage in. Thus, in the current study, we varied the number
of “set” problems and examined the effects on problem
solving flexibility.

Participants
Participants were 107 undergraduates from a mid-sized
private university in the Midwest. Ten participants were
excluded due to experimenter or participant error. An
additional 16 participants were excluded because they had
previously heard of Luchins’s water jar problems. Thus, the
final sample contained 81 undergraduates (42 male, 39
female; 3% African American or black, 7% Asian, 17%
Hispanic or Latino, 73% white) ranging in age from 18-22
years (M = 19 years, 0 months). Participants received one
extra credit point toward an introductory psychology class
for their participation.

Task and Procedure
Participants were asked to solve Luchins’s classic water jar
problems (Luchins, 1942, 1946; Luchins & Luchins, 1950).
In these problems, participants are presented with three jars
(A, B, and C), each of which holds a certain amount of
water. The goal is to determine how the jars can be used to
measure out a fourth amount of water. Jars are not
graduated, thus requiring participants to use a combination
of addition and subtraction to solve each problem.
The task involves three different types of water jar
problems: (a) set problems, which can be solved only using
a complicated, multi-step strategy: B – A – 2C (i.e., the socalled “Einstellung method”), (b) critical problems, which
can be solved either by the multi-step strategy, or by a much
simpler, single-step strategy: A – C (i.e., the so-called
“direct method”), and (c) extinction problems, which can be
solved only using the single-step strategy (Luchins, 1942).
Participants in our experiment were seated at computers
situated in individual cubicles. They were told: (a) that they
would be solving a set of problems, (b) that they should
record all answers on the given answer sheet, and (b) that
they should solve the problems as quickly as possible, while
still maintaining accuracy. After participants solved each
problem, they pressed the spacebar to indicate that they had
reached a solution, and then they pressed the spacebar again
when they were ready to see the next problem.
As in previous experiments, participants completed a
sample problem, followed by a specified number of “set”
problems (see experimental conditions below), 2 critical
problems, 1 extinction problem, and 2 additional critical
problems. All critical and extinction problems were
identical to those used by Luchins (1942, 1950) and set
problems were drawn from Luchins (1942, 1950) and
Bugelski, et al. (1962).

Experimental Conditions
Participants were randomly assigned to one of six
experimental conditions. The conditions differed in terms of
the number of set problems that participants were required
to solve: 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 40.

with only 24 of 81 participants (29%) using the single-step
strategy on both problems (see Table 1 for use on both
problems by condition). We used binomial logistic
regression to predict the log of the odds of using the singlestep strategy on both pre-extinction critical problems (see
Agresti, 1996). Note that the conclusions are unchanged
when we predict the log of the odds of using the single-step
strategy on at least one problem (instead of both). The
predictor variables included number of set problems
(centered) and number of set problems (centered) taken to
the second power. As predicted by a change-resistance
account, the log of the odds of using the single-step strategy

Coding
We first examined performance on each phase of the task
separately: set problems, pre-extinction critical problems,
extinction problem, and post-extinction critical problems.
Responses on the set problems were coded as correct or
incorrect. Responses on the critical problems were coded as
single-step correct, multi-step correct, or incorrect. The
response on the extinction problem was coded as correct or
incorrect. In addition to analyzing each phase of the task
separately, we also created an overall task performance
score to summarize how flexibly participants performed on
the water jar task. Participants received 1 point for every
critical problem solved correctly with the efficient, singlestep strategy, and 1 point for solving the extinction problem
correctly. Thus, the maximum task performance score (i.e.,
5) reflects ideal performance on the water jar task. Response
time, measured as the time from problem presentation until
the participant pressed the space bar to indicate that they
had reached a solution, was also recorded for each problem,
although for the sake of conciseness, we focus mainly on
the strategy data here.

reflect the fact that performance neared floor levels at 10 set
problems and remained there; there was no evidence of a
significant rebound in performance. €

Set Problems

Performance on the extinction problem was good, with 67
of 81 participants (83%) solving it correctly. Table 1
displays performance by condition. We used binomial
logistic regression to predict the log of the odds of solving
the extinction problem correctly. The predictor variables
included number of set problems (centered) and number of
set problems (centered) taken to the second power. As
predicted by a change-resistance account, the log of the
odds of solving the extinction problem correctly decreased

Performance on the set problems was near ceiling, and the
percentage of set problems solved correctly was similar
across conditions (1 set problem M = 100%, 5 set problems
M = 95%, 10 set problems M = 99%, 20 set problems M =
97%, 40 set problems M = 98%). As expected, the time it
took participants to solve their final set problem decreased
as the number of set problems increased (1 set problem M =
32.35 s, 5 set problems M = 41.08 s, 10 set problems M =
25.99 s, 20 set problems M = 21.54 s, 40 set problems M =
18.22 s). We performed the appropriate orthogonal
polynomial contrasts with number of set problems as the
independent variable and reaction time on the final set
problem as the dependent variable. The coefficients used in
this analysis accounted for the unequal spacing between
conditions. The overall effect of condition was significant,
F(4, 55) = 2.61, p = .04, η 2p = .16. Moreover, the linear

trend was significant, F(1, 55) = 24.96, p = .01. None of the
other polynomial contrasts approached significance. Results
were comparable when we used average reaction time
(instead of reaction time on the final set problem) as the
dependent variable. Importantly, there were no significant
differences in reaction times between conditions on the first
set problem, F(4, 55) = 0.26, p = .90. Taken together, these
results support the assumption that participants gained
fluency as the number of set problems increased.

Pre-extinction Critical Problems
Performance on the pre-extinction critical problems was
near ceiling in terms of correctness. All participants solved
at least one of the two problems correctly, and 79 of 81
participants solved both problems correctly. However, use
of the efficient, single-step strategy was not widespread,

Discussion

Post-extinction Critical Problems
Performance on the post-extinction critical problems was
near ceiling in terms of correctness. All participants solved
at least one of the two problems correctly, and 76 of the 81
participants solved both problems correctly. Use of the
efficient, single-step strategy was higher than it was on the
pre-extinction critical problems, but it was still far from
universal, with 44 of the 81 participants (54%) using the
single-step strategy on both problems (see Table 1 for use
on both problems by condition). We used binomial logistic
regression to predict the log of the odds of using the singlestep strategy on both post-extinction critical problems. The
predictor variables included number of set problems
(centered) and number of set problems (centered) taken to

Given the seminal nature of Luchins’s (1942) Einstellung
phenomenon, it is surprising that the present study was the
first to test the effect of number of set problems on
performance on the water jar task. Luchins anecdotally
reported no effect of the number of set problems (beyond 1)
on participants’ tendency to apply the mental set. However,
our results suggest that Luchins was incorrect. We found a
large effect of the number of set problems on problemsolving flexibility. As the number of set problems increased,
participants’ flexibility decreased. This result places
important constraints on theoretical explanations of the
mental set phenomena and contributes to our understanding
of the role of practice in learning and performance.
Several prevailing theories (and intuition alike) would
have predicted a negative linear association between number
of set problems and problem-solving flexibility (e.g.,
Langer, 2000; Diamond & Kirkham, 2005; Thelen & Smith,
1994; Munakata, 2001; Wiley, 1998). For example,
according to the graded representations account, problemsolving flexibility decreases with increasing practice
because “latent” memory representations of the original
strategy compete with “active” memory representations of
the problem at hand (Munakata, 1998). Increased practice
with set problems strengthens latent representations of the
original strategy, and these representations come to exert a
larger influence over behavior than the active representation
of the given problem. This central tenet is shared by Wiley
(1998) in her seminal study of expertise as a mental set.
According to Wiley, experts weigh their prior domain
knowledge more heavily than the information in a given
problem when they construct their problem representation.
Although both of these accounts (and others) would have
predicted the results of the present study, the literature
pointed to at least two other possible outcomes.
First, the number of set problems (beyond 1) could have
had no discernable effect on participants’ subsequent
problem-solving flexibility. This would have been
consistent with Luchins’s (1942) conclusions. It also would
have been consistent with conclusions of other researchers
who have examined the effect of number of “set” trials on
performance in other problem-solving tasks. For example,
Wellman, Cross, and Bartsch (1986) conducted a metaanalysis of babies’ performance on the A-not-B task and
concluded that the number of A trials has no effect on
babies’ tendency to reach for location A after the object has
been hidden in location B. Similarly, Zelazo, Frye, and
Rapus (1996, Experiment 2) studied children’s performance
on the dimensional change card sort (DCCS) task and
concluded that the number of pre-switch trials has no effect
on children’s tendency to keep sorting based on the preswitch rules after the rules have been changed. It should be
noted that although the A-not-B and DCCS tasks include a
motor component that is absent in the water jar task,
Marcovitch and Zelazo (2009) assert that it may be possible
for representational habits (like those in the water jar task)
to influence behavior in a similar way.

the second power. Again, the linear term was significant, βˆ
= -0.055, z = -2.20, Wald (1, N = 81) = 4.87, p = .03, but the
quadratic term was not,

βˆ < 0.001, p = .64.

Overall Task Performance

€

We created an overall task performance score to summarize
how flexibly€participants performed on the water jar task.
Averaging across conditions, the overall task performance
score for participants was 2.80 (out of 5). Scores ranged
from 0-5 (SD = 1.75). As shown in Figure 1, participants’
overall task performance decreased as the number of set
problems increased. We performed a set of orthogonal
polynomial contrasts with condition (number of set
problems) as the independent variable and overall task
performance score (out of 5) as the dependent variable. The
coefficients used in this analysis accounted for the unequal
spacing between conditions. There was a large significant
effect of condition overall, F(5, 75) = 10.10, p < .001, η 2p =
.40. Consistent with our previous analyses, the linear trend
was significant, F(1, 75) = 35.72, p < .001, and the
quadratic trend was not, F(1, 75) = 2.20, p = .14. None of
the higher-order trends were significant. The linear
component accounted for 71% of the variance that is due to
the condition effect.

Second, the number of set problems could have had a
nonmonotonic effect on subsequent problem-solving
flexibility. This outcome would have been consistent with
the hierarchical competing systems account (Marcovitch et
al., 2002; Marcovitch & Zelazo, 2006). According to this
account, the initial decrements in flexibility that accompany
repeated practice with a strategy are eventually overcome as
the strategy becomes automatized and the problem solver
becomes increasingly likely to reflect on the task at hand.
Marcovitch et al. (2002) provided support for this account in
a study of babies’ performance on the A-not-B task.
Specifically, the authors found an inverted U-shaped
association between the number of A trials and babies’
tendency to reach for location A after the object has been
hidden in location B. Although previous evidence
supporting this account has been limited to babies and
young children, Marcovitch and Zelazo (2009) state that the
theory is intended as a foundation on which studies of
executive function across the lifespan can be built.
Indeed, the hierarchical competing systems account
shares the implicit assumption of several theories of skill
acquisition. Several theories suggest that increased practice
with a strategy eventually leads to fluency and
automatization, which in turn reduces demands on working
memory and supports higher-level cognitive processes
(Anderson, 2002; Kotovsky, Hayes, & Simon, 1985;
Haverty, 1999; Logan, 1988). The primary role of practice,
according to these theories, is to “free resources” so they are
available for other aspects of problems solving. In fact,
numerous studies have shown that increased practice with a
single strategy frees cognitive resources and makes them
available for other problem-solving processes such as: (a)
noticing novel problem features (Chase & Simon, 1973), (b)
generating new solution strategies (Shrager & Siegler,
1998), (c) extracting meaning from unfamiliar problems
(Haverty, 1999; Sweller, 1988), and (d) suppressing
inappropriate solution strategies that have been retrieved
many times in the past (Rosen & Engle, 1998).
Of course, in the present study the association between
the number of set problems and flexibility was not Ushaped, at least not in the range of 0-40 set problems.
However, it is entirely possible that flexibility would have
started to increase if participants had been given even more
set problems. We assumed 40 set problems would be
sufficient based on the number of set problems informally
investigated by Luchins (1942) and because the babies in
Marcovitch et al.’s (2002) study only needed between six
and 11 trials to overcome the initial decrements in flexibility
that come with repeated practice. However, water jar
problems involve a complex, multi-step strategy, and
participants may need more than 40 problems to achieve the
automaticity required for conscious reflection. Although
reaction times on the set problems indicated that participants
gained fluency as the number of set problems increased, it is
still possible that it was not enough for participants to
consciously reflect on the task.

Still another possibility is that participants did achieve the
automaticity required for conscious reflection, but that the
reflection did not occur because there was not an explicit
push to do so (e.g., feedback or incentive). When students in
one of Luchins’s (1942) water jar experiments were given
an explicit warning, “don’t be blind,” they were less likely
to rely on the practiced strategy. It is possible that this type
of explicit push to reflect on the task would be most
beneficial for participants who have practiced many set
problems (e.g., 40). Marcovitch and Zelazo (2009) do argue,
however, that there is a baseline probability of reflection on
each trial and that it increases with task experience.
Although the present results support the hypothesis that
problem-solving flexibility decreases as practice with set
problems increases, it is possible that the results could be
explained by mental fatigue or boredom. Participants who
solved 40 set problems spent more time in the experiment
than did participants who solved 0 or 1 set problem; thus,
they may have been more mentally fatigued. We argue that
fatigue did not play a major role because: (a) the difference
in total participation time between participants who solved 0
versus 40 set problems was never more than 30 minutes and
(b) reaction times on the 40th set problem were significantly
faster than reaction times on the 1st set problem. Still, time on
task is a confound that could be addressed in a future study.
In terms of practical implications, the present findings
may be of interest to educators who are weighing the pros
and cons of repeated practice and drill on future learning
and performance in domains such as mathematics. For
example, previous research has shown that repetitive
practice with arithmetic facts may improve some types of
inductive reasoning (Haverty, 1999), but hinder
understanding of some algebraic concepts (McNeil, 2007).
A better understanding of the way in which practice affects
later problem-solving flexibility might help us gain a better
understanding of these seemingly contradictory findings.
More generally, the present results contribute to a
growing body of work suggesting that the effects of practice
may not be as straightforward as we like to think. Practice is
typically something that we think of as being beneficial to
learning and performance, so cases like this where it hinders
flexibility can provide a unique window onto how the mind
works. One important next step will be for researchers to
develop a general framework for understanding the
differences between the situations when increased practice
increases versus hinders problem-solving flexibility.
