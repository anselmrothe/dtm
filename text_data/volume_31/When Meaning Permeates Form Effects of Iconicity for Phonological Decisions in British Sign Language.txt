Previously, we demonstrated a processing advantage when
iconic properties of signs were made salient in a
corresponding picture in a picture/sign matching task
(Thompson et al., 2009). The current study investigates the
extent of iconicity effects with a phonological decision task
(does the sign have straight or bent fingers) in which the
meaning of the sign is irrelevant. The results show that
iconicity is a significant predictor of response latencies with
more iconic signs leading to slower responses. We conclude

aid language processing. That iconicity is used in areas such
as poetry and word play suggests that signers have an
awareness of the iconic properties of signs and these
properties might therefore be tapped into specifically under
conditions that draw signers’ attention to them. Crucially,
however, these studies aimed to minimize the possibility
that iconicity effects could arise from meta-cognitive
strategies or direct attention to iconicity, by using
experimental methodologies in which participants' attention
is diverted from the iconicity manipulation itself.
    Despite these recent findings, however, little is currently
known about the scope of iconicity effects. Given that
iconicity in signed languages is represented in the
phonological form of signs, there may exist stronger links
between phonological and semantic levels of representation.
This is suggested by the Thompson et al. study. However,
one possibility is that iconicity effects are task dependent
(i.e., limited to conditions where semantic representations
and their iconic properties are directly relevant to the task).
This, for example, could have been the case in the                   Figure 2: BSL signs with straight and bent handshapes that
