Abstract: Why do people use spatial language to describe social relationships? To what extent do they anchor their
thoughts about social relationships in terms of space? In this study, we used a drawing task to further explore the
conceptual structure of social distance. Participants read a short narrative about passing through an environment
that included stick figures that represented either friends or strangers, and then drew a line that represented the
route. On average, people drew paths that were closer to the stick figures when they had read about friends versus
strangers, critically, even though no interaction was stated. These preliminary results support the idea that the
conceptual structure of social relationships is linked to thought about space.
