Abstract: Previous research shows that people can acquire an impressive number of word-referent pairs after viewing
a series of ambiguous trials by accumulating co-occurrence statistics. The present study extends the cross-situational
word learning paradigm, which has previously dealt only with noun acquisition, and shows that humans can concur-
rently acquire nouns and adjectives (i.e., a natural category with a distinctive feature). Furthermore, participants
were able to learn ad hoc categories of referents consistently co-occurring with a label, while simultaneously learning
instance labels. Thus, humans demonstrate an impressive ability to simultaneously apprehend regularities at multiple
levels in their environment.
