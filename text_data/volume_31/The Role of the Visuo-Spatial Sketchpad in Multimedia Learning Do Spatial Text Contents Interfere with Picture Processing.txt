processing of text with visual contents, less empirical
evidence is available, but one study by Deyzac, Logie, and
Denis (2006) confirms the assumption that visual text
contents are processed in the visual component of the VSSP.
Thus, if text contains information about spatial or visual
configurations it is not only processed in the PL but also in
the spatial or visual component of the VSSP, whereas if it
contains more abstract information it is not processed in the
VSSP but in the PL alone.
  Another line of research on the spatial component of the
VSSP has also shown that this structure is not only
responsible for the processing of spatial information but also
for the control of eye movements. Accordingly, several
studies demonstrated interferences between the execution of
eye movements and the processing of spatial information
(e.g., Postle et al., 2006).
  To sum up, it can be assumed that the VSSP can be
separated into a visual and a spatial component. Besides                Figure 1. The processing of multimedia material in the
