subcategories include subcategories like “African animals”,
“birds”, and “beasts of burden”. Participants’ patterns of

      To compute pairwise word similarity scores, we use
BEAGLE’s representation of words as holographic vectors
(Jones & Mewhort, 2007). These vectors contain
information about a word’s context and order with respect
to other words this word is likely to appear with. BEAGLE
creates the memory representation for a word by first
assigning it a random vector, and then updating this memory
representation using the random vectors of the other words
that this target word appears with in each sentence of the
corpus. After training on the Wikipedia corpus, BEAGLE’s
memory representations were used to compute the pairwise
cosine similarity matrix for a list of 772 animals, which
contained the 373 unique animals produced by our
participants plus 399 additional animal names found in the
Wikipedia corpus. Adding the extra animals provides the

   We also evaluated the static-fluid hypothesis comparison
using cosine similarity in a similar way to our earlier
analysis with IRT. Fluid switches have a cosine similarity of
0.32 (SD = 0.10), and transitions which are not switches
have a mean similarity of 0.39 (SD = 0.14). Static-not-fluid
switches have a similarity of 0.34 (SD = 0.12). As in the
IRT analysis , the static-not-fluid switches are significantly
different from fluid switches but are not different from the
reference class of non-switches (data not shown). Again,
this indicates that the static-not-fluid switches do not
correspond to “true” patch switches, and supports the fluid
switch model.
   Assuming cosine similarity approximates semantic
relatedness, we should observe that words on either side of
fluid patch boundaries are less similar than within-patch
transitions. Figure 5 shows that words straddling patch
boundaries are indeed significantly less similar than words
produced following a patch boundary. Using the same
reasoning, we can also investigate the marginal value                  Figure 5. Mean ratio (and SEM) of pairwise

D, we found the similarity between each pair, s(A,B),
s(B,C), s(C,D).         We then computed the ratios,
r1=s(B,C)/s(A,B), r2=s(C,D)/s(B,C), allowing us to identify
transitions that were low similarity followed by high
similarity (as in Figure 5). We then compared the
corresponding similarity ratio to the mean ratio for the same
participant (using a one-sample t-test), categorizing the first
word in any ratio that was significantly below the mean as
the first word after a switch.          Using this method,
participants had a mean of 14.16 (SD = 4.68) switches over
3 minutes. Approximately 54% of these were also fluid
