Task and Procedure
Interaction Condition Sitting at separate computers, pairs
of participants completed a computerized version of the
Pictionary task. The task consisted of six games. In each
game the director tried to communicate 16 concepts to the
matcher, who selected a response from 20 items (16 targets                Figure 1: Screenshot of the director's computer screen

they are dissimilar to their pseudo-partner's drawings.
