3) Based on this memory, association strengths are stored
   only for possible pairings that respect logical inferences.
4) Observers have access to the current state of their long-
   term memory and add association strength to a pair that is
   probabilistically chosen in proportion to the current
   strengths of present referents.
5) When some pairs repeat over successive trials and others
   do not, a bias that stores more or less association strength
   for the repeated subset of pairs than the non-repeated
   subset is allowed.
   a) This bias is allowed to vary for cases where the
      repeated pair(s) are just a one trial repeat, and the cases
      where an item repeats three or more trials in succession.
      The change in bias allows observers who believe they
      already ‘know’ a pairing (because it repeats three times
      in a row) to divert attention/storage to other pairings.
   The model is instantiated as follows (see Figure 3 for
pseudocode). An 18 (word) by 18 (referent) associative
matrix is filled initially with constant values (1/18 in every
cell), reflecting initial uncertainty about the pairings. Every

the one repeated pair occurs three trials in succession, the
same rules apply, but a different value for α is allowed: α′.
The intuition is that attention may shift for pairs that are
repeated many times: once learned, the regularity of a
repeated pair may be used to reduce ambiguity for the
remaining pairs.
   For the case of two repeated items, the same rules apply,
with the same α, save a repeated choice is made from the
two repeated objects, with storage α⋅X/2, and a non-
repeated choice is made from the two non-repeated objects,
with storage (1-α)⋅X/2 (again respecting sampling without
replacement).

proportion to the association strengths stored in the matrix,
