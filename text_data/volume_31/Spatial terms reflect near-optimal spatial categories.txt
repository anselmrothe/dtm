             Spatial terms across languages                             these focal colors (Roberson et al., 2005).
The categories picked out by spatial terms differ across
languages, but also reveal universal tendencies (Bowerman
& Pederson, 1992; Bowerman, 1996; Talmy, 2000;
Bowerman & Choi, 2001). Melissa Bowerman designed a
set of 71 spatial scenes (see a sample of 10 in Figure 1),
which have been used to elicit spatial terms in a variety of
languages. Levinson et al. (2003) analyzed the spatial terms
applied to these scenes by speakers of 9 unrelated
languages. This study and others confirm the general
picture of universal tendencies co-existing with language-
specific categorization patterns.                                          Figure 2: Color naming grid (upper panel), and the color
