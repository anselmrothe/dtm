Modulation (H.M.) Paradigm

Abstract: People often try to control which memories enter awareness, and these efforts have been shown to have
lasting consequences for the later accessibility of suppressed memories. In the Think/No-Think (TNT) procedure
used to study such control, intentionally suppressing retrieval leads to a reduction, rather than an augmentation, in
hippocampal activity. We hypothesized that this modulation would alter ones ability to encode and consolidate novel
information presented between TNT trials. Specifically, attempts to suppress retrieval prior to an incidental-encoding
task should disrupt encoding, whereas suppressing retrieval after incidental encoding should truncate ongoing consolidation.
In the current studies, participants confronted novel stimuli presented between TNT trials. Both source memory
and cued-recall for items presented around suppression trials were significantly impaired. Thus, engaging cognitive control to suppress retrieval can be adaptive for preventing unwanted memories from entering awareness, but
detrimental to the encoding or retention of experiences in the temporal surround.
