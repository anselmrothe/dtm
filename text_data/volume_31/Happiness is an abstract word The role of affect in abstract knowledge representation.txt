   Thus, when imageability and context availability are held
constant, an ‘abstractness effect’ emerges, such that
speakers are faster in recognizing abstract rather than
concrete words. These results go against both the dual-
coding as well as the context availability views as they
predict no difference in RTs if imageability and context
availability ratings are matched across concrete and abstract
words. Next, we confirm these novel findings in a
regression analysis of lexical decision RT data for 903
words from the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al.,
2007).
