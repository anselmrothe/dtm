Behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging                     Building on the success of previous neuroimaging
evidence suggests that categories can be learned via
explicit and/or implicit mechanisms (Ashby & Maddox,
2005; Kéri, 2003; Nomura & Reber, 2008). Ashby and
Maddox (2005) described a feedback category-learning
paradigm with different category distributions to
selectively encourage one of the two types of learning:
Explicit or Rule-Based learning (RB) versus Implicit or

have been dissociated behaviorally using working
memory dual-task procedures (e.g., Zeithamova &
