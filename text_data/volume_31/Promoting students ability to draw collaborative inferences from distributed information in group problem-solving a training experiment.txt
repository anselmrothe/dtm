Abstract: By drawing collaborative inferences, groups can co-construct new solution-relevant knowledge from in-
formation initially distributed between individuals. Such collaborative inferences result in a true assembly bonus;
however, in unsupported collaboration, they are much less frequent than inferences from undistributed informa-
tion (Meier & Spada, 2007). In an experiment, n=36 dyads of university students were trained to apply specific
collaborative inferencing strategies. Four training interventions (no training
