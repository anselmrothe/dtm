(Experiment 2), items occur, followed very shortly in
some cases by outcomes, and participants must respond
very quickly when the outcome occurs; so quickly that
they must rely on perhaps implicit expectations to
anticipate the outcome in order to respond quickly
enough. The former setting is the kind in which one may
expect explicit reasoning processes to occur, whereas the
latter shares features with many tasks thought to involve
implicit learning (Lewicki et al., 1987; Cleeremans &
McClelland, 1990). Our study therefore provides a direct
basis for comparing the outcome of learning in these two
very different kinds of task situations. Crossed with the
task manipulation, we employed a framing manipulation:
Half of the participants in each task were given an explicit
causal framing similar to those used in experiments with

The following information may help to improve your performance
during the experiment.
Some of the objects that you will see during the experiment have the
power to make the dot appear, while others do not.
The computer has randomly decided which objects have this power at
the beginning of the experiment.
You cannot tell just by looking at the object whether it has the power to
make the dot appear.
However, you can learn which objects have this power based on whether
or not the dot appears when the object is inside the box.
If two objects appear inside the box and at least one of them has this
power, the dot will usually appear.
Sometimes the box may malfunction, and the dot may occasionally fail
to appear when it should, and may occasionally appear when it

paid pool participated in the experiment for payment.
Three were removed because their performance during
training fell more than two standard deviations below the
mean. One participant was removed due to experimental
error. This resulted in 22 participants in each condition.
Design and Procedure The overall structure of the
training phase was identical to Experiment 1, except that
there were twice as many training trials. In order to keep
the contingencies as similar as possible subjects were
given 43 dot outcome trials for each “+” item and 5 dot
outcome trials for each “-” item. Participants completed
528 training trials comprising 48 exposures to each
training item and 288 test trials, comprising 24 exposures
to each test item.
   Trials began similarly to Experiment 1. Each trial
began with the box framing the center portion of the
screen. Objects appeared after a random 1-3 second delay
as in Experiment 1. However, in the current experiment,              Figure 3: Direct and indirect effects as measured by

version of our task, training participants on the fast-paced
RT task from Experiment 2, but placing them in the
explicit prediction task from Experiment 1 during the test
phase. This ensured that outcomes during the test phase
would not wash out any of the effects over the course of
test, and would maximize the likelihood of generating
indirect effects if it was indeed possible to do so.
