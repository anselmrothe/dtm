Abstract: When people are uncertain about the category membership of an item (e.g., is it a dog or a dingo?)
research shows that they tend to rely only on the dominant or most likely category when making inductions (e.g., how
likely is it to befriend me?). An exception has been reported using speeded-judgments where participants appeared to
use information from multiple categories to make inductions (Verde et al., 2005). In a modified replication we found
that participants tended to rely on the frequency with which features co-occurred when making feature predictions,
independent of category membership (Experiment 1). A follow up forced participants to make category membership
judgments before feature predictions and found evidence for reliance on the dominant category in addition to the use
of feature co-occurrence. The results question the extent to which multiple categories are used in speeded induction
when the frequency of co-occurring features can be relied upon for induction.
