   LF-learning is thus termed non-competitive and
results in learning the probabilities of events occurring
given a particular cue. We call this “conditional
probability learning.”
The Feature-Label-Order Hypothesis
    Both FL and LF-learning capture probabilistic
information about the predictive relations between cues
and responses in the environment; in each case, the
relations are affected both by positive and negative
evidence. However, there are fundamental distinctions                Figure 4. The development of cue values in a simulation of
