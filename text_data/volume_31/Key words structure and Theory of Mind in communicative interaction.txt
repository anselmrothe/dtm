Abstract: The study describes the communicative and linguistic characteristics of subjects behavior in the verbal
communication processes. Several series of experiments aimed at revealing capability for interaction and distributed
attention in the process of joint accomplishment of an experimental task were conducted in different variations of
groups of schizophrenic patients and normal controls. This capability is based on deducing the mental state of
communicative partner (ToM ability). In our experiments one partner of aÌ€ dyad had to follow the instructions of the
other partner when visual monitoring was not available. Key words method was used for the analysis of the verbal
data. During the interaction, participants, discribing each object, had to go through three phases: Identification,
Localization, and Checking. Our results show that schizophrenic patients performed significantly worse than controls
in coming through all these phases. Schizophrenic patients use lesser key words set than optimal one; their poor
performance could be explained by ToM deficiency.
