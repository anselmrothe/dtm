predicted, based on the theory of Milton and Wills (2004),
that overall similarity sorting would involve greater
perceptual processing of the stimuli than single-dimension
sorting and result in a more even distribution of attention
across the stimulus dimensions. In contrast, single-
dimension sorting would involve greater selective attention
toward the chosen dimension.

the chosen dimension were in one category and all the zero

but also describe their sort as being based on that particular
