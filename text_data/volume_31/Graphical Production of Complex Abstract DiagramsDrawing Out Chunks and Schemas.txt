Drawing is a common human activity that has been rather
neglected by Cognitive Science. Compared to the extensive
studies on the nature of writing or the work on perception,
reasoning and learning with diagrams, our understanding of
the mechanisms underlying production of graphical artifacts
at the cognitive level is relatively meager. There have been
some notable studies. The classic work of van Sommers
(1984) explored and described some of the underlying proc-                 Figure 1: Modified Rey figure used in the experiment.
esses of drawing and Goel (1995) examined the more fluid
nature of sketching particularly in the task of design prob-
lem solving. Some studies have used drawing as a means to
investigate other aspects of cognition such as children’s in-
creasing flexibility in their use of schemas during cognitive
development (Karmiloff-Smith, 1990) or the impact of al-
ternative representational systems on conceptual leaning
(Cheng, 2003).
