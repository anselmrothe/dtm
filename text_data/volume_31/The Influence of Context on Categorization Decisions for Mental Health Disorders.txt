Feature Specific Effects of Context
The preceding analyses collapsed ratings across all of the
presented criterial features to look at the general effect of
context. Using such an analysis washes out any individual
differences that may exist between criterial features in their
resilience to the effect of context. Looking at the criterial
features listed in the Methods section, the nature of the
features used as criteria for Conduct Disorder vary greatly in
their severity and underlying character. For example, both

activity are features of Conduct Disorder that are meant to
be given equal weight in diagnosis. Is it possible that
features that vary so greatly in their composition and
apparent severity are weighted equally by clinicians and

much the context that feature is presented in will affect its
interpretation. For instance, learning that a patient is cruel
to animals may result in enough of a negative emotional
response that the surrounding contextual features do not
have the opportunity to influence diagnostic evaluations.
This is a rich avenue for future research.
                          Summary
Mental health disorders are a unique form of category in
that the structure and classification criteria for the category
are explicitly laid out for the categorizer. Mental health
clinicians must discover these explicit criteria from their
patients amidst a large amount of non-diagnostic
information that may or may not be useful for their
diagnostic decision-making. Despite the explicit structure
prescribed for categorization, we found that mental health
clinicians are influenced by the context within which
diagnostic symptoms are presented in unique and
idiosyncratic ways. Future research should focus on
discovering the true nature of how these individual
differences in the assessment of diagnostic criteria come
about. Such research will shed light on the clinical
diagnostic process as well as categorization more generally.
