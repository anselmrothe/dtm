    The previous literature provides reasons to doubt that (1)                We understand RH to entail:

According to (1), Pr (A|B) = Pr (B|A) only if Pr (A) = Pr (B).            1. Pr [ind](A|B) is an unbiased estimate of Pr [dir](A|B).
Yet the inversion of conditional probabilities is a common
feature of judgment even when it is recognized that Pr (A) 6=             2. Pr [dir](A|B) and Pr [ind](A|B) are equally close to
Pr (B) (Eddy, 1982; Dawes, Mirels, Gold, & Donahue, 1993).                    Pr [obj](A|B).
Such inversion undermines the conviction that most people
