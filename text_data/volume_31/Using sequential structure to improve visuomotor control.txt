the lettuce before it is requested. If one does not in fact subsequently order lettuce, this occasionally produces errors.
Taken together, these two observations (that targets can
move, and that people’s prior beliefs about targets matter)
suggest that when people are asked to point to targets that
can move in a potentially predictable manner, people will try
to anticipate where the target is likely to appear, and use this
knowledge to improve the accuracy of their pointing. In this
paper, we explore this topic. We report an experiment and
a simple model developed to investigate the extent to which
people exploit the statistical background knowledge to alter
movements under time pressure.

Abstract
In daily life, people make rapid, goal-directed movements to
interact with their environment. Since these movements are
goal-directed, the outcome of the movement is important. A
plan is typically formulated to make the movement using visual information about target location before the movement is
initiated. However, in dynamic environments people need to
track the location of an object if it moves during the reach.
Additionally, it would be beneficial to motor performance to
learn the distribution of target locations over multiple reaches.
In this paper we develop a simple model that describes how
people might exploit the sequential structure over a series of
trials to improve rapid visuomotor control. We then present
empirical data from a sequential tracking task that investigates
how people’s knowledge of the location of objects is updated
over trials to improve pointing performance. The model is able
to predict when people will hit and miss targets with reasonable success. Interestingly, the results suggest that not only are
people able to use sequential information but also look for it
even when it does not exist.

Influences on Rapid Pointing

Keywords: visuo-motor control; Bayesian models; sequential
learning

Introduction
People regularly make goal-directed reaches to interact with
the world, where the goal or target of these movements is usually visually defined. During the course of such a reach, visual information about the target location relative to the hand
will necessarily change. In part, this is because the hand is
moving, but it can also be because the target itself is moving.
In some cases the target is essentially stationary (e.g., pressing the car stereo button) and thus easily predictable. In others, the motor plan must be adapted during the course of the
movement, because the target can move in an unpredictable
fashion (e.g., swatting a mosquito). To be able to reach accurately and precisely, people must therefore be able to code
not only the location of the goal, but also be able to respond
to any changes in information about the goal that might affect
the outcome of the reach.
It makes intuitive sense that people develop beliefs about
the probability of events occurring, and that these beliefs
might be updated as the events actually occur. For example,
rapid motor control in everyday life appears to show a strong
effect of prior expectation. Consider the visuomotor control
problems facing the “sandwich artists” at a delicatessen during the busiest time of day: most people who order sandwiches will ask for lettuce as one of the ingredients. As a
consequence, it is not uncommon for the server to reach for

There are several key factors that significantly influence rapid
pointing performance. The quality of visual information
about target location available during the planning stage can
limit pointing precision (Ma-Wyatt & McKee, 2006); similarly, the expected error associated with the reach influences
the planning, which in turn relies on visual information about
where the hand landed relative to the target (Trommershäuser
et al, 2005). Finally, the well known speed-accuracy trade-off
for controlling movements (Fitts, 1954) means that time pressure can play an important role: without time pressure, people
have ample time to integrate feedback and refine movements,
and so will need to rely less on their prior beliefs.
More closely related to the current work is the finding
that people make use of information differently depending on
when it becomes available. In particular, the weight given to
visual information is increased in the final stages of the movement, most likely because it tends to be the most informative
about the outcome of the movement (e.g. Sober & Sabes,
2005). Moreover, there is some evidence that people can
optimally integrate multiple sources of sensory input during
a reach. For instance, Körding and Wolpert (2004) demonstrated that if there was increased uncertainty associated with
new visual feedback during a reach, observers relied more
heavily on prior beliefs about sensory estimates, integrating
these estimates in a manner consistent with Bayesian statistics. In short, it may be that the visuomotor system can adapt
to changing sources of information over short time scales to
achieve and maintain a consistent level of motor performance.
An interesting extension to this line of work is to consider
how the information available to the observer changes over
a time scale of multiple trials. For example, a recent experiment by Ma-Wyatt & McKee (2007) investigated people’s
ability to could correct their reach in an online fashion. If the

1424

target location changed early in the reach, people were able
to hit the new target accurately; if the target shifted late in the
reach, they could not.1 However, when the shift occurred late,
people showed a sensitivity to prior probabilities. When the
target was equally likely to appear at the two possible locations, observers pointed to a location approximately equidistant from each. When the relative probability of the target
landing at one location was altered, then the mean pointing
location was shifted towards the more likely location.

Yu & Cohen 2009). Suppose, for instance, that the predictive value of a previous observation decays exponentially over
time (as is typical of simple “constant rate of change” processes). Then the belief updating method described previously will overweight old data relative to new data. This suggests that the knowledge available to the learner about θn+1 ,
the probability distribution associated with the next observation, might be better modelled by
θ | x ∼ Dirichlet(α + f (1), . . . , α + f (m))

Prior Beliefs & Rapid Movements
In view of this literature, it seems likely that people’s solutions to rapid visuomotor inference problems are strongly influenced by the prior beliefs they hold about the relative likelihoods of different outcomes. With this in mind, consider
the problem faced by a learner who – as part of their participation in an experiment – encounters a series of observations
xn = (x1 , . . . , xn ). What prior beliefs might he or she bring
to the next trial in the experiment, xn+1 ? Should the learner
average across all previous trials in the experiment, or weight
some observations more heavily than others? If the latter is
true, it might be expected that more recent past events are
more predictive of the current experiences. If this occurs, how
far back in time do people integrate past observations in order
to make predictions, and does this change as a function of the
statistics of the task itself? In the spirit of recent cognitive theories of sequential prediction (e.g., Brown & Steyvers 2009;
Yu & Cohen 2009) we describe a simple Bayesian model that
is applicable to rapid pointing tasks.

Bayesian Beliefs & Non-Stationary Worlds
Suppose that the object to be tracked may occur at one of m
distinct locations, z1 . . . zm . Letting θk = Pr(x = zk ) denote
the observer’s subjective belief that an object x will appear at
the kth location, we might describe the belief state by θ =
(θ1 , . . . , θm ), and specify a symmetric Dirichlet(α) prior over
possible values for θ. Formally, the observer should assume
the following generative model for the first observation,
x1
θ

∼
∼

Multinomial(1, θ)
Dirichlet(α, . . . , α)

(1)

If the probabilities remain invariant across trials, then standard Bayesian learning implies that, having observed the data
x, the posterior distribution over θ would become
θ | x ∼ Dirichlet(α + n1 , . . . , α + nm )

nk + α
n + mα

where f (k) denotes a time-weighted sum of the relevant observations that fell in the kth location
f (k) =

n
X

exp(−λ(n − i))δ(xi − zk ).

(5)

i=1

In this expression δ(·) is the Kronecker delta function that is
1 if its argument is zero and 0 for all other input values. As a
result the observer would predict that
Pr(xn+1 = zk | xn , λ) =

α + f (k)
P
mα + m
i=1 f (i)

(6)

For the present purposes, we fix α = .01.

Movement Error Given Uncertain Beliefs
If an observer has expectations described by Equation 6, how
might he or she construct motor plans for the pointing action,
and what predictions does that imply about the probability
that the observer will hit the target? To a first approximation,
we may assume that Fitts’ (1954) law holds, and the time t
that an observer requires to make a reach to a target of width
w located a distance d from the current one scales logarithmically,
t = a1 + a2 log2 (2d/w).
(7)
If we assume that the learner starts with a plan to reach to
location ℓ, and then partway through the reach discovers that
the true target location is zk , then Fitts’ law provides a method
to determine the form of the error probability as a function
of distance. Making some simple assumptions about errors,
Equation 7 suggests a simple model in which the implied hitting probability decays exponentially with distance:
Pr(hit | φ) = exp(−φd(ℓ, zk ))

(8)

(2)

where nk counts the number of previous occasions on which
a target fell in location zk . After integrating out his or her uncertainty about the exact probabilities θ, the predicted probability that the next observation falls in location zk is simply
Pr(xn+1 = zk | xn ) =

(see Gelman, Carlin, Stern & Rubin, 1995).
In non-stationary environments, this updating method is
not optimal (e.g., Arulampalam, Maskell & Gordon 2002;

Consistent with previous work, participants appeared to require
approximately 150ms to update the movement plan online.

where d(ℓ, zk ) denotes the distance between locations ℓ and
zk . The free parameter φ in this expression is a function of
the original parameters of Fitts’ law (the width w is treated
as fixed, while one of the two remaining degrees of freedom
disappears because we assume that the observer can hit the
target perfectly given an arbitrarily long time to do so).
If the observer knew the target location ahead of time, then
the choice of motor plan is obvious: aim for the target. Given
the uncertainty about potential locations, the story is a little
more complex. One possibility is to choose a single plan that
in some manner averages over this uncertainty; a second is
to prepare multiple plans (one corresponding to each possible
location), and to weight them accordingly. This loosely mimics the distinction between prototype models for categories

for the final target are shown as white dots, and the axis along which

the centre of the circle), and the initial fixation point was below the
intermediate one.

(e.g., Reed 1972) and exemplar models (e.g., Medin & Schaffer 1981), with the multiple plan model mapping onto exemplar models. Using an exemplar-style multiple plan model,
the hit probability becomes
Pm
Pr(hit | φ, λ) =
k=1 exp(−φd(xn+1 , zk ))
(9)
× Pr(xn+1 = zk | xn , λ)
The interpretation of the parameters in this model are as
follows: φ governs the ability of the observer to compensate
for errors during the course of the reach itself, while λ governs the extent to which the observer generalizes from old
observations to new ones. Note that when λ → 0, all observations are weighted equally and the belief updating reduces
to a smoothed running average model (Equation 3). On the
other hand, as λ → ∞, all previous observations are assumed
to be of zero predictive value, and so the observer has a uniform belief distribution on every trial. Only at intermediate
values of λ does the observer show interesting sequential effects.

Experiment
We used a two step paradigm to investigate whether people
could use sequential dependencies to update their position information. If it is the case that people are able to track sequential dependencies across trials, then we should observe
an improvement in performance on consecutive trials, and a
significant cost when the run of sequential dependencies ends.
Our aim is to test whether people are able to use this information to improve pointing performance and to estimate over
how many trials this information is retained.

Method
Participants. Four observers participated in the experiments. Three were naı̈ve to the purposes of the experiment
(MO, BS and MP); the other was an author (AM). A fifth
observer (PH) also participated, but produced data too noisy
to analyze. Additionally, due to time constraints, MP completed only half of the trials. All observers had normal or corrected to normal visual acuity and no known motor deficits.
All observers gave informed consent to participate in the experiments.

Figure 2: Time course of a single trial. The fixation dot remained
on screen until a key is pressed, commencing the trial (0ms). The
intermediate target appeared immediately, remaining on screen for
110ms before disappearing. The final location was revealed at the
290ms mark and vanished at 400ms. The observer was required to
hit this target before the 700ms mark.

General procedure. The observer rested their chin on a
chin rest and was seated 40cm away from a touchscreen in
a darkened room. On each trial, the observer fixated a central
point and made a key press on the keyboard in front of them
to initiate the presentation of test stimulus. The target was
a high contrast white dot that subtended 0.5◦ of visual angle
(i.e., the dot was 0.7 cm in diameter). A white dot was presented for 110ms, after which it disappeared. After a delay of
180ms, another dot appeared in one of five possible locations,
spread out in an arc as illustrated in Figure 1. The probability of the target appearing at any one of these locations was
manipulated as outlined below. The target remained on the
screen for 110ms (see Figure 2 for a timeline of an example
trial). Observers were instructed to point as rapidly to the final location of the target as they could, and endpoints were
registered by the touchscreen. We measured movement time
as the time between the key press to initiate the trial, and the
time at which the finger touched the screen.
Observers received negative feedback if their touch was too
slow (>700ms), or too far away from the target location (>2◦
of visual angle, or ≈1.5cm). Because we were interested in
determining if the observer would be able to use information
about the sequential dependency of a target location across
trials to alter their motor plan, it was important to ensure that
reach times remained fast, and reasonably consistent across
trials. We therefore used a points system to encourage observers to reach quickly. If the movement time was too slow,
150 points were deducted from the observer’s score. If the
point was within 2◦ of the target, the observer won 400 points.
Points won were converted to a cash reward at the end of the
experiment - observers were awarded 0.001¢ per point won.
Each observer completed several blocks of each of the sequential and non-sequential conditions. The order of sequential or non-sequential conditions was counterbalanced across
observers. The order of the blocks for each of the sequential and non-sequential conditions was randomised for each
observer.
Sequential structure. Each observer completed blocks of
trials in which the position of the target was either sequentially dependent on the location of the target on previous trials (sequential) or randomly drawn (non-sequential). We cre-

ated the sequential dependencies by generating 1000 observations using a simple hidden Markov model that produced a
slight bias towards more central locations: from left to right
of screen, the marginal distribution over locations was [.143
.250 .246 .220 .122], which was broken in to 10 blocks of
100 trials. This produced the sequential structure shown by
the circles in Figure 3. A second set of stimuli without any
sequential structure were produced by randomly permuting
the original items, and breaking the permuted set into 10 new
blocks. These are illustrated with the squares in Figure 3.
Apparatus. Stimuli were presented on a 15in touchscreen
(ELO Touch Systems, Elo Entuitive Systems). This is a standard CRT monitor overlaid with a touchsensitive layer. Pressure from the fingertip triggered a program that calculated
the (x, y) position of the finger. The sensitivity of this information was tested by measuring the variability of the response to a regular artificial surface (an unused pencil eraser)
touched with care to the same position. The error associated
with this response was less than 0.1◦ in the x and y direction, and well within the error associated with a finger press.
The experiment was conducted using custom written software

Overview. A brief summary of the data is presented in Table 1. As one might expect, the probability of successfully
hitting the target tended to be higher when sequential dependencies were present in the data, but the effect was significant
only for MO (Bayes factor2 31:1). For AM, MP and BS, the
Bayes factors all favored a no-difference model (odds ratios
1:2.5, 1:7.7, 1:14 respectively). In the case of MP and BS this
is not surprising, as both showed very high hit rates in both
conditions, suggesting that they were probably not under a
great deal of time pressure.
Modelling details. The specific version of the model that
we fit to the data assumes that each observer has a single
motor-correction parameter φ that is invariant across conditions, but may apply different intertemporal generalization
rates depending on whether the data have sequential structure (λs ) or are independent (λi ). We present the results of
the model fitting exercise in two ways. In order to provide a
concise summary, Table 1 lists the best fitting parameter values for all four observers (Bayesian MAP estimators under
uniform priors on [0, 10] for all parameters).
Illustrative data. To provide a more concrete illustration
of the raw data and the model predictions, Figure 4 plots the
performance of MO during one representative block of trials
containing sequential structure, and Figure 5 contains analogous plots for a block without such structure. The upper
panels plot the predicted probability with which the observer
would hit the target on every trial; white markers denote trials
when MO succeeded in doing so, and black markers denote
the miss trials. Lower panels plot the location of the target
on every trial, again color-coded by the outcome of that trial.
As is clear in both cases, the model tends to predict high hitprobability on the actual hits and low hit-probability on the
misses, as one would hope if the model was performing well.
Model fit. Since space does not permit extensive quantitative evaluations, we simply examine how effectively the
model is able to predict whether people were likely to hit the
target. For each participant, we bin the trials according to the
model predictions as to the likelihood of a hit, and then count
the proportion of hits on those trials. As is shown in Figure 6,
although the model fails in some respects, when the model
predicted people were more likely to hit the target, they were
in fact more likely to do so. Overall, the fits were slightly better in the sequential dependencies condition (white dots), but
it is interesting that the model performs above chance even
in the independent condition (black dots). That is, the model
is only able to distinguish between trials on the basis of the
locations of preceding trials, but nevertheless is able to discriminate between human hits and misses even when no actual sequential dependencies exist. This suggests that people
are, in effect, “looking” for structure even when none exists.
In addition to the overall model fits presented in Figure 6,
it is instructive to examine some key qualitative characteris2

tics of the data. One such effect relates to the length of the
“run” preceding the current trial. By run length, we mean the
number of trials that have elapsed since the last time the target was in a different location. So if the last five trials were
in locations 2,1,4,4,4 we have a run length of 3. If the current
trial is also in target location 4, then the run has continued.
If it is in any other location, the run breaks. As is shown in
Figure 7, the length of the run has an influence on the probability of hitting the target. The model successfully predicts
that as the run length increases, the difference in hit probability between “run continuing” trials and “run break” trials
gets larger. However, it does not always do so in precisely the
right fashion (as is most clear for observer MO).

Discussion
Overall, it appears that observers do use the sequential information in the experimental trials to assist rapid reaching: all
observers showed nonzero λ values for the sequential condition, suggesting they weighted recent information more heavily (only two participants did so in the independent condition). Additionally, one out of four observers, induces a significant improvement in hit rates.
When model performance was assessed, we found that it
was able to predict performance reasonably well for all four
observers, though there were some systematic deviations that
suggest that further model development is needed. Moreover,
when considered in terms of the key trend evident in data (effect of run length), the model was able to capture the basic
patterns shown by the human participants, though not perfectly. This is encouraging because it suggests that despite its
simplicity, the model has captured significant aspects of our
data.
In terms of the experiment itself, it is important to note is
that it was designed to have the second target presented late
in the observer’s reach. This was done to ensure that the ob-

server would be under time pressure and would not have sufficient time to update their plan and therefore reveal, through
their errors, what those priors were. Accordingly, the overall performance should have been kept to moderate levels.
This manipulation was successful for two observers (AM and
MO); however, since it did not succeed for MP and BS, it may
be necessary to tailor the time of second target presentation
individually for each observer.

General Discussion
Though this work is preliminary, the results of our experiment
indicate that – consistent with what we expected given previous research – people do use prior history about target locations to update hand movements. In terms of the modelling
exercise, it is encouraging to note that the simple model presented here provides a reasonably good account of individual
participant behavior on a trial-to-trial basis, not merely in the
aggregate. Furthermore, it also predicts specific qualitatively
important trends, such as the change in change in hit probabilities that accompany different lengths of trial runs. With
this in mind, future work will seek to extend the model to accommodate response biases (some locations may be easier to
reach to than others) and to predict specific landing locations
rather than just hit probabilities. In the meantime, however,
this simple model represents a useful first approximation.
In terms of the broader research questions, one of the main
goals in this line of work is to consider the extent to which
people can integrate information from quite different sources
and times scales. On the one hand, during a rapid movement
the world is constantly changing both in an allocentric sense
(the fly moves before you can swat it) and also an egocentric sense (eyes and hands move relative to the position of the
body). On the other hand, in between these rapid movements
people acquire rich conceptual representations of their world
