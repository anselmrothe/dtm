Abstract: Benchmark tests of human category learning (e.g., Shepard, Hovland, & Jenkins, 1961) play a major
role in evaluating theories and models. New benchmarks are needed to reveal psychological patterns and to better
test the explanatory power of competing accounts. We sought to investigate a clean and systematic benchmark that
focuses on the type and degree of regularity underlying category structures, rather than the number of predictive
dimensions. Learners were each assigned to one out of the nine formally-distinct, two-way (unbalanced) classification
schemes over the nine examples based on two nominal ternary dimensions. A clear ordering of learning difficulty was
observed among the four 3-vs-6 category structures (see also, Lee & Navarro, 2002), while more subtle distinctions
characterized the five 4-vs-5 structures. The DIVA model (Kurtz, 2007) produced a good quantitative fit to these
data. Theoretical implications of these results, including comparisons to well-known reference point models, are
addressed.
