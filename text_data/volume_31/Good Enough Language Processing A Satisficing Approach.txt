In the active version of the Visual World Paradigm,
participants are presented with a 2 x 2 grid of objects, and
they are given spoken instructions to move objects in a
workspace (Ferreira & Tanenhaus, 2007). Two quadrants,

and the distractor object, and are usually the objects that are
moved first. The right side of the display contains two goal
