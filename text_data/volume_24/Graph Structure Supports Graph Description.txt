had a greater market share in 1983?”). The few studies that
investigate spontaneous descriptions of graphs have focused
on what is described (e.g., global trends vs. local, piecemeal
descriptions [Carswell, 1993; Carswell et al., 1998]; trends
vs. comparisons [Zacks & Tversky, 1999]) and the
organization of the descriptions (Shah, Hegarty, & Mayer,
1999; see below) rather than on the communicative quality
of the description. One reason for this oversight might be
the lack of a rigorous measure of communicative quality.
  In the work presented herein, we apply a theory of graph
comprehension to predict the characteristics of graphs that
facilitate descriptive communication. To measure the
