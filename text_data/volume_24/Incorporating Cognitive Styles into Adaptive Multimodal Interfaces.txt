independent people seem to follow more easily a
restructuring approach and use internal referents in
other situations (Antonietti et al, 2000).
Field-dependent people tend to adopt a passive
approach in learning and problem solving. They prefer
to be guided and to rely on external referents.
Perception is dominated by the prevailing field.
When internal referents are less available, field
dependent people are more likely to respond to the
dominant properties of the field as given.
Lesser use of restructuring may handicap field
