to be retained in memory.                               ipants seated an unconstrained distance from the

monitor, and began with a five min period for dark
adaptation. Participants were told that, on each
trial, they would see a sequence of zoids presented
very rapidly. The zoids in the sequence would begin
falling from a location near the top of the screen:
each successive zoid would appear below the one
before to create a sequence of falling zoids much
as in the Tetris game. Each zoid was present for
250 ms, and each sequence consisted of between five
and seven zoids, with the actual number determined
randomly (and with equal likelihood) on each trial.
At some random point in this sequence, participants
would be presented with a combination of a test zoid
and board, and would need to make one of two types
of responses, depending on whether they were in the
indirect or direct memory condition.
   In the indirect condition, participants had to de-
cide whether the zoid presented at test would fit
snugly into the board. Participants responded in the
affirmative using the index finger of the dominant
hand, and in the negative using the index finger of
the non-dominant hand, pressing either the “z” or
“/” keys on the lower row of the keyboard. In the
direct condition, participants had to indicate with a
single key-press both judgment about whether the       Figure 4: Preview-present trials: interaction of lag
