unwilling to subscribe to the notion of social-group domain-

is likely to have made inferences about relatively small
populations throughout most of its history. In addition,
formal notions of induction evolved relatively recently (see
Gigerenzer et al, 1989), most probably in response to a need
for safe inferences about population whose size was
unknowable or infinite. Although the ’direct’ strategy is
primitive when compared to more ’indirect’ forms of
induction, such a strategy may work very well with small
populations.
