acquisition is fostered by avoiding explicit instruction. Recall
that in L2 learning, both implicit and explicit knowledge are
present. It is plausible to suggest that if a required piece of
linguistic competence is no longer part of the current
competence of a learner, then he will need to learn it explicitly
in order to (re)gain an implicit, automatized ability to use it
again.
   Earlier in this paper Ellis’ definition of explicit and implicit
knowledge with regard to L2 learners was accepted. However,
the definition of the two types of knowledge needs to be
modified in terms of P-consciousness and A-consciousness of
language. Explicit knowledge is something that a learner is P-
conscious of and can verbalize on request. By contrast, though
