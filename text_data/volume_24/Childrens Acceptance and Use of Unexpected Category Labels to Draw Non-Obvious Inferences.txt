(Gelman & Coley, 1990; Gelman & Markman, 1986), there
must be limits on this process. Surprisingly, no one has
considered situations under which children reject
linguistically provided category information. Using the
same paradigm and materials as in the first study, our
second study takes up this question with preschoolers.
                       Experiment 1
Experiment 1 was designed to test whether 24-month-olds
would use an experimenter-provided, sometimes counter-
intuitive, category label when making non-obvious
inferences. In particular, we were interested in whether they
would use the label to make an inference that was different
from the one they would make without a label.
