Predictions
Our primary predictions refer to comparisons between
and within experimental groups (rather than assuming a
2x2 factorial design; in particular Group 4 plays a sub-
sidiary role in the study, and will only be analysed in
relation to first-order findings).
   The main predictions concern the number of prag-
matic moves needed to solve the puzzle. As we expect all
groups to learn throughout the course of the experiment,
we predict a gradual reduction of the mean number of
pragmatic moves required to solve the puzzle. This fa-
miliar practice effect constitutes the baseline which we
expect to be modulated by the experimental factors of
instructional goal orientation and device support.
   If the instructional manipulation encourages members
of Group 2 to invest additional moves in trials 1–3 and
this in turn results in better learning, they ought to need
fewer moves on trials 4–6. Thus, we predict an interac-
tion of instruction and trial for Groups 1 vs. 2.
