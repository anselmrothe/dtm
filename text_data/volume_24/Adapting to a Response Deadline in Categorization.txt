Abstract
The effect of a response deadline on categorical
decisions was investigated. Time available for response
was manipulated in the test phase, along with stimulus
difficulty. Effects of these manipulations were observed
in response accuracy, and in the mean, standard
deviation and skew of the reaction times. The effects
observed demonstrate that participants responded to the
deadline in an adaptive manner - reducing their reaction
time to long-latency decisions whilst leaving short
latency decisions relatively unaffected. A simple
connectionist model of categorical decisions (Wills &
McLaren, 1997) is shown to account for this behavior.

Introduction
Categorization is a basic and essential cognitive
function. Our ability to engage it has been well studied,
and a number of different theories of the underlying
processes have been proposed (e.g. Ashby & Gott,
1988; Gluck, 1991; Nosofsky, 1986; Nosofsky, Palmeri
& McKinley, 1994). At first, attempts to quantitatively
fit models of categorization to empirical data
concentrated on categorization accuracy. However, in
recent years, models which have the potential to predict
reaction time distributions in categorization have been
developed and evaluated (e.g. Ashby, 2000; Maddox,
Ashby & Gottlob, 1998; Lamberts, 2000; Nosofsky &
Palmeri, 1997; Wills & McLaren, 1997).
This paper focuses on the effects of imposing a
response deadline on a) participants' response accuracy
and b) the nature of their reaction time distributions. It
has been known for some time that categorical
decisions made under time pressure may be different to
those made without time pressure (eg. Smith & Kemler
Nelson, 1984). More recently, this avenue of research
has been developed by investigation of the effects of
time pressure with more complex stimuli (e.g.
Lamberts, 1995; Palmeri & Blalock, 2000) coupled
with formal modeling of the results found (e.g.
Lamberts, 1995).
It is worth considering Lambert's (1995) study in a
little more detail as it provides one motivation for the
current work. At one level, the results found are
intuitive. In these experiments, Lamberts employed a
simple deadline procedure. Participants first learned, in
the absence of time pressure, to categorize artificial
stimuli (schematic faces) into two categories. Following
this training, participants had to categorize test stimuli
before a given deadline (e.g. 1600ms from stimulus

onset). Failure to respond in time resulted in an error
tone, followed by the presentation of the next stimulus.
Participants were informed about the time available for
response, which changed at regular intervals. In one
experiment, the deadlines employed were 600ms,
1100ms, 1600ms and no deadline. Participants were
less accurate at shorter deadlines. Interestingly, the
effect was stimulus specific, with some stimuli being
considerably more affected by time pressure than
others. Lamberts proposed a particular formal model of
this effect (the "Extended Generalized Context Model"
or EGCM, Lamberts, 1995) and showed that it provided
a good fit to the accuracy data.

Time pressure and reaction time
Lamberts' experiments reveal another result. In his
experiments, categorization in the absence of a response
deadline takes approximately 1500ms (Lamberts, 1995,
experiment 2). As the stringency of the deadline
increases, so the mean reaction times decrease, with
categorization under a 600ms deadline taking about
450ms. In other words, categorical decisions appear to
take considerably less time when there is time pressure
than when there is not. This is, of course, intuitively
obvious. The interest, from the perspective of the
current paper, is that there seem to be at least three
distinct reasons why it might happen. When considering
the following, it is important to remember that the
descriptions relate to observed reaction time
distributions - they are not statements about underlying
process:
Non-selective adaptation: The participant reacts to the
imposition of the deadline in a manner that decreases all
reaction times in the distribution by a fixed amount. As
a consequence, mean of the distribution will drop, but
the standard deviation and skew will be unaffected.
Selective, linear adaptation: The participant reacts to
the imposition of the deadline in a manner which
decreases all reaction times in the distribution by a
fixed factor (i.e. RTdeadline = f Ã— RTno deadline). As a result,
the mean and standard deviation of the distribution will
drop, but the skew will be unaffected.
Selective, non-linear adaptation: The participant reacts
to the imposition of the deadline in a way that cannot be
characterized as non-selective, or selective, non-linear,
by the definitions above. Changes in the mean, standard
deviation, and skew of the distribution may all be
observed.

Demonstrating adaptation to a deadline
It therefore seems clear that to distinguish between
these explanations, one must estimate changes in the
mean, standard deviation and skew of the reaction time
distribution produced by imposition of a deadline.
Whilst the experiment reported in this paper is by no
means the first to investigate the effects of a deadline
on categorization accuracy and reaction time, previous
work has had at least one of the two following
limitations:
Missing data artifact
In a number of studies (e.g. Lamberts, 1995; Lamberts
& Brockdorff, 1997; Palmeri & Blalock, 2000) it is
possible that the changes observed are an artifact of the
data collection procedure. In a response deadline
procedure, longer-than-deadline responses typically
result in a "time out" error and hence no data about
reaction time is available for that trial. As a direct
consequence, mean response time is lower than it would
have been without a deadline. The same problem
applies to studies that compare two different deadlines.
In experiments where percentage of time-outs is
reported by condition, they can been seen to increase as
the response deadline becomes more stringent.
One solution to this problem is to use a "response
signal" procedure (e.g. Lamberts, 1998) where
participants are instructed to respond as soon as
possible after they get a signal to do so. Another
solution (see e.g. van Zandt, Colonius & Proctor, 2000)
is to provide a "too slow" signal after the response has
been made.
A third possibility is to use the standard response
deadline procedure, but only evaluate responses that fall
below a certain percentile of the reaction time
distribution (with time-outs being considered as the
slowest trials). The largest number of time-outs made at
any level of time pressure, by any participant, to any of
the test stimuli, determines this percentile. For all
conditions and stimuli, only responses that fall below
that fixed percentile are considered. It is therefore
important to keep the percentage of time-outs low so a
reasonable amount of data is still available for analysis.
It is this final possibility that is employed in the current
study.
Insufficient information
The three possibilities for adaptation outlined above can
only be distinguished if one has estimates for the mean,
standard deviation, and skew of the reaction time
distributions. Recently, many studies of categorization
have begun to report reaction time distributions in detail
(e.g. Maddox & Ashby, 1996). However, categorization
studies that employ time pressure as a manipulation
tend to concentrate on categorization accuracy, and may

also report mean reaction times. Data from different
tasks, such as perceptual matching, show that the mean,
standard deviation, and positive skew all reduce in
response to increasing time pressure (van Zandt et al.,
2000).
Given the absence of appropriate information, it was
decided to perform a short empirical study that would
have the potential to discriminate between the three
types of adaptation to a response deadline which have
been outlined. This is followed by a demonstration that
a particular model of categorical decisions (Wills &
McLaren, 1997) can mimic the results found.
Implications of both the empirical and the theoretical
investigations for categorization research are then
discussed.

Experiment
The current experiment had two phases. In the training
phase, participants were presented with novel, abstract
stimuli paired with either the category label "A" or the
category label "B". In the test phase that followed,
participants had to decide the category membership (A
or B) of unlabelled stimuli either without time pressure,
with a 2500ms time limit for each decision or with a
1000ms time limit for each decision (a betweenparticipants manipulation).
Whilst these deadlines may appear relatively lax
compared to the reaction times observed in some
classification tasks, previous work (e.g. Wills &
McLaren, 1997) indicates they represent a fairly high
level of time pressure for participants with relatively
little experience of the complex stimuli employed.

Method
Participants and apparatus
The participants were 44 adults, mainly undergraduate
students. The experiment was in two different, quiet
cubicles on two Acorn RISC PC computers, with 14"
color monitors. Participants sat 1 meter from the screen.
Stimuli
Each stimulus was a collection of twelve different small
pictures (hereafter "elements") in a 4.5cm by 3.5cm
rectangle outline, arranged on an invisible four-by-three
grid (see Figure 1 for an example stimulus). Every
stimulus contained twelve elements drawn from the
pool of thirty-six elements we have used in previous
experiments (see Jones, Wills & McLaren, 1998, p.37).
At the beginning of the experiment, and separately for
each participant, 12 elements from the pool were
randomly designated as category A elements, and a
different 12 as category B elements. The remaining 12
elements were not used for that participant.

Figure 1: An example stimulus
Training stimuli
Sixty training stimuli (thirty from each category) were
created for each participant. Each training stimulus was
constructed by starting with all 12 elements
characteristic of a particular category (e.g. category A
elements for a category A training stimulus). Then,
each element in the training stimulus underwent a 10%
chance of being replaced by an element chosen from the
other set (e.g. replaced by a category B element in the
case of a category A training stimulus). Choice of
replacement elements was random within the constraint
that no element could occur more than once in any
given stimulus. The position of elements within a
stimulus was randomly determined for each stimulus
presented, with the constraint that exactly one element
occurred at each location in the four-by-three grid.
This method of stimulus construction produces
training examples which are composed predominately
of elements characteristic of a particular category but
which also exhibit considerable variability.
Test stimuli
Test stimuli were designed to vary in difficulty of
categorization. Given the nature of the training stimuli,
the correct response to a test stimulus is to categorize it
as an "A" if it contains more A elements than B
elements, and as a "B" otherwise. A number of previous
experiments have demonstrated that as the difference
between the number of A elements and the number of B
elements increases in a stimulus of this type, the
probability of a correct classification also increases
(Jones et al, 1998; Wills & McLaren, 1997). Test
stimuli in this experiment are therefore described in
terms of their difference scores (the absolute value of
the number of A elements minus the number of B
elements).
All stimuli contained twelve elements, so there are
seven possible difference scores and hence seven levels
of difficulty. The seven differences scores are 12, 10, 8,
6, 4, 2 and 0, which are denoted as having a difficulty
level of 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 respectively. Twenty
examples at each of the first six levels of difficulty were
created for each participant. The specific elements used
to create each test stimulus were chosen randomly
within the constraint provided by the difference score,
and the constraint that stimuli in which category A
elements were more numerous that category B elements
should occur with the same frequency as stimuli in
which category B elements were more numerous than
category A elements. As in the construction of the

training stimuli, the position of elements within a test
stimulus was randomly determined, and no element was
allowed to occur more than once in any given stimulus.
Ten examples of stimuli with a zero difference
(difficulty level 7) were also generated for each
participant. However, as there is no correct answer for
such stimuli, performance on them is not analyzed in
this paper.
Procedure
Participants were allocated to one of three groups that
differed only in the time allowed for decision in the test
phase. These groups are referred to hereafter as the
1000ms, 2500ms and No-deadline groups. Sixteen
participants were allocated to the 1000ms group,
sixteen to the 2500ms group, and twelve to the nodeadline group.
The sixty training stimuli were presented sequentially
and in a random order. Each example was presented for
five seconds in the center of the monitor accompanied
by the appropriate category label (presented as a large
capital A or B in an outline rectangle immediately to
the right of the stimulus). The stimulus and the category
label were then replaced with mid-gray rectangles that
stayed on the screen for two seconds and were followed
by the next example. Participants were not required to
respond in any way in this first phase of the experiment
but were asked to concentrate on the examples shown
as they would later be asked to classify new, unlabelled
examples. This training procedure has proved effective
for stimuli of this type in a number of other experiments
(Jones et al, 1998; Wills & McLaren, 1997).
The training phase was followed immediately by the
test phase. There were 130 stimuli in this phase (see
"Stimuli" section) which, again, were presented
sequentially and in a random order. Participants
classified each stimulus as an "A" or a "B" by pressing
either the "X" or ">" key on the computer keyboard.
The allocation of keys to responses was counterbalanced across participants.
In the 1000ms and 2500ms conditions, participants
were told that they only had 1 second or 2.5 seconds to
make each decision. If they did not respond within this
time interval, the stimulus was replaced by the phrase
"TIME OUT!" in 2cm high letters. After a five second
count-down and a two-second pause, the next stimulus
was presented. This time-out procedure was designed to
be as salient as possible in order to keep the total
number of time-outs low.

Results
Accuracy and mean reaction time data from the nodeadline condition have been reported previously (Wills
& McLaren, 1997). All other data are novel.
In the 2500ms condition, 2.87% of trials were timedout. The figure was 4.84% in the 1000ms condition.

Whilst both rates are relatively low, there were
significantly more time-outs in the 1000ms condition,
t(30) = 2.41, p < 0.05. All participants in this
experiment made at least sixteen responses before the
deadline at each level of stimulus difficulty. Therefore
the four slowest responses made by each participant at
each level of stimulus difficulty were disregarded in the
following analyses (see Introduction for an explanation
of this procedure). Time-out trials were counted as the
slowest possible responses. For the remaining data, the
accuracy, and the mean, standard deviation and skew,
for each level of stimulus difficulty and for each
participant were calculated.
This data set was subjected to a series of mixed-model
ANOVAs, with one within-participants variable
(Difficulty, 6 levels) and one between-participants
variable (Deadline, 3 levels). A significance level of .05
was set for all analyses. Figures 2 and 3 summarize the
data set by providing across-participant averages.

significantly, F(10, 205) < 1. Mean reaction time
increased with stimulus difficulty, F(5, 205) = 20.19,
and decreased with time pressure, F(2, 41) = 12.92. The
effect of stimulus difficulty was less pronounced with
increasing time pressure, as evidenced by a significant
interaction term, F(10, 205) = 9.32.
The standard deviation of reaction times increased
with stimulus difficulty, F(5, 205) = 5.77, and
decreased with increasing time pressure, F(2, 41) =

by a significant interaction term, F(10, 205) = 8.45.
The skew of reaction times decreased with increasing
time pressure, F(2, 41) = 19.52. However, stimulus
difficulty had no significant effect, F(5, 205) = 1.31,
and the interaction term was non-significant also, F(10,

oi, c =

ni,c is the total input to unit i on update c and E and D
are constants representing the rate of excitation and
decay within the unit.
In addition to the magnitude-term inputs, each unit
has a fixed excitatory connection to itself and fixed
inhibitory connections to other units. These connections
cause the units to "compete" with one another until only
one has non-zero activation. Grossberg (1976), and
many others since, have employed similar, neurallyinspired decision-making systems.
The total input to a unit i on update c is given by

that E = 2D, and this assumption is continued in the
current simulation. T is not a parameter of the model in
any important sense, as its only purpose is to convert
from one arbitrary unit of time (cycles) to another
(seconds). Hence, model fitting involves the
manipulation of seven free parameters, from which
predictions for 57 data points are to be derived.
Model fitting proceeded via a grid-search procedure.
The range and steps of the parameters were N (0.1â†’3,
step 0.1), E (0.01â†’0.05, step 0.01 and 0.05â†’0.5, step
0.05), M (0.01â†’0.08, step 0.01), and S (0.3â†’0.7, step
0.05) for each of the three S parameters, with the
constraint that S did not increase as response deadline
decreased. 10,000 decisions were simulated for each
permutation of parameters and for each stimulus
difficulty level. The cycles-to-decision in each set of
10,000 decisions were then place in rank order, and the
2,000 slowest decisions discarded (in order to mimic
the data deletion performed on the empirical data).
This collection of simulated decisions was then
employed to produce a set of predictions for each of the
permutations of the parameters N, E, M and the three S
parameters, SND, S2500 and S1000. The relationship
between cycles-to-decision and seconds was then
estimated for each set of decisions via linear regression

ni ,c = ri,c + oi ,câˆ’1 âˆ’ âˆ‘ oj ,câˆ’1
j â‰ i

where ri,c is the noisy input produced by the
magnitude term vi. The noise in these particular
simulations had a range of +N to -N, and a rectangular
distribution. Superimposed on this noise is the
constraint that ri,c cannot exceed one or fall below zero.
The first unit to produce an activation greater than S is
assumed to cause the execution of its corresponding
response. The number of cycles the unit takes to exceed
S represents decision latency, with each cycle
representing exactly T seconds.
The model employed includes a number of
simplifications, including the assumption that noise is
rectangular and that non-decisional components of the
categorization process take a fixed Tres seconds.
Neither simplification is central to the operation of the
model - similar predictions can be derived from a model
with a variable Tres and Gaussian noise. However these
simplifications have the advantage of considerably
speeding the search of parameter space.
The model described above has seven parameters - N,
E, D, M, S, T and Tres. The basis of the model's
predictions is that time pressure reduces the value of S,
so S was assigned a different value for each of the three
between-participant conditions of the experiment. In all
previous applications of the model, it has been assumed

Figure 4: The winner-take-all model
of the 18 empirical mean reaction times to the 18 mean
cycles-to-decision. The gradient of the line gives the
conversion factor T whilst the intercept provides the
value for Tres.
Once T and Tres were determined for a set of
predictions, they were employed to convert each of the
180,000 simulated decision latencies into seconds.
Calculations of mean reaction time, reaction time
standard deviation and reaction time skew for each
stimulus difficulty level in each of the three conditions
were then performed using standard formulae.
Scaled root mean square deviations (SRMSD) were
used to assess closeness of fit. Scaling was performed
by multiplying each empirical data point and each
prediction by a factor s. SRMSD was calculated
separately for accuracy, mean RT, RT standard
deviation, and RT skew predictions. The scaling factors
employed were 2, 0.5, 1 and 1 respectively. Total
SRMSD was taken to be the sum of these four
SRMSDs. The set of parameters providing the best
overall fit were as follows N: 2.6, E: 0.03, M: 0.04,
SND: 0.55, S2500: 0.50, S1000: 0.40, Tres: 0.033. This is the
fit shown in Figures 2 and 3. One cycle of the model
was estimated by linear regression to be 0.014 of a

second. Cycles-to-decision predicted over 95% of the
variance of mean reaction times in this regression (r2 =
0.953). The SRMSD for accuracy predictions was
0.061, for mean reaction time it was 0.047, for reaction
time standard deviation it was 0.062 and for reaction
time skew it was 0.063.

Discussion
Imposition of a response deadline decreased the mean,
standard deviation and skew of reaction times in a
categorization task. From this information about the
distribution, one can conclude that these participants
adapted to the response deadline in a selective, nonlinear manner (as defined in the Introduction). This is a
result which, if found to be general, would need to be
accommodated by formal models of categorical
decisions. The fact that one of the reaction time
distributions to be fit is negatively skewed might be
considered as a particular source of concern, as
categorization have almost uniformly been fit to
distributions with some degree of positive skew in the
past.
In the space available, it was not possible to evaluate
whether all current models of categorical decision have
the potential to accommodate the results found. Instead,
it was demonstrated that one particular model of
categorical decisions (Wills & McLaren, 1997) can
mimic the pattern of results found. Wills & McLaren's
model is (in approximate terms) a connectionist
implementation of a random-walk process (e.g. Laming,
1968). As such, its follows the same basic principles as
a variety of other accounts of categorical decision,
including stochastic forms of decision-bound theory
(Ashby, 2000), extensions of EGCM that can model
reaction times (Lamberts, 2000), and Nosofsky &
Palmeri's (1997) exemplar-based random walk model. It
therefore seems likely that many contemporary models
of categorization are capable of accounting for the sort
of adaptation to a response deadline observed in this
study.
