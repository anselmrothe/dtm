that individuals did not have the expertise in algebra to
solve the problems in a totally incremental fashion. In this
design there was also no way to separate out those who
experienced partial insights while solving the algebra
problems (see Ohlsson, 1992). These factors may have
also confounded the hindsight bias results. Despite all of
these issues, there was clear evidence for differential
amounts and patterns of hindsight bias between insight
