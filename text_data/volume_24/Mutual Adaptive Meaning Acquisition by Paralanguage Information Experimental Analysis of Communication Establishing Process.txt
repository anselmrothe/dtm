the direction instructions than the distance ones. We in-
vestigate the processes of these two learning phases in
terms of the prosodic elements of the instructions, the
movement of the paddle, and the variety of instructions
given. We focused on the pitch of the teacher’s voice,
which, among the prosodic elements, had the strongest
relationship with the meaning of the instructions. As      Figure 4: Pitch Curves of “Ue” and “Shita” in Phase 1.

A communication experiment was carried out to observe
the effects of a teacher’s adjustment in teaching strat-
egy and of paralanguage information in terms of learn-
ing the meanings of unknown utterances. An adjustment
in teaching strategy was observed as a mutual adaptation
process, in which the two subjects on a team learned to
respond more appropriately to each other’s behavior, and
paralanguage information was observed to function as a
negative reward in a reinforcement learning process for
meaning acquisition. These two phenomena thus play
important roles in learning the meaning of unknown ut-
terances.
