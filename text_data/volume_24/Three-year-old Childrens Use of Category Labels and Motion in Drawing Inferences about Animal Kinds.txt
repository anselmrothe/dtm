   It is postulated that young children, such as 3-year-
old children (who have been found to be ready to draw
inferences based on the similarity and dissimilarity of
familiar linguistic labels), would use both verbal labels
and motion cues to draw inferences about animals.
However, when confronted with a choice between

   Although to what extent children use category labels
and motion was compared in this study, we are not
suggesting that linguistic and perceptual information
play distinct roles in young children’s inferences (for
this argument, see also Gelman & Medin, 1993; Jones
& Smith, 1993). Evidence has shown that children use
both linguistic and perceptual (including static and
dynamic) information to draw inferences.         However,
how static shape cues, motion and linguistic labels
interact to guide children’s inferences remains to be
determined in future studies.
