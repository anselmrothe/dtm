In our opinion, cognitive factors are fundamental in medi-

system hierarchy and the view of action chains.
       Cognitive factors are critical at various levels of the

At the lowest core level, it is individuals who trigger er-        Figure 1. The system hierarchy of human errors in medicine

good rules, encoding deficiencies in rules, action defi-        rules, etc.
