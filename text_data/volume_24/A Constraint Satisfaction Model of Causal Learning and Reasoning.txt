of the model. It is possible to add a learning component that
acquires knowledge about the relation between event pat-
terns and hypotheses based on feedback in a prior learning
phase (see Wang et al., 1998, for a model adding associative
learning to Echo).
    In summary, our constraint satisfaction model seems to
offer a promising new way to model causal learning and
reasoning. It is capable of modeling phenomena in a wide
range of different tasks, which thus far have been treated as
separate in the literature. Relative to normative Bayesian
models, our connectionist model allows it to simulate a large
number of different tasks and different phenomena while
using fairly simple computational routines. It proved capable
of capturing a number of recent phenomena that have pre-
sented problems to extant models of causal cognition. More
tests of the model clearly seem warranted.
