One technique for studying how memory is constructed is

   Martin and Fernberger (1929) performed such a study                   Wickelgren defined a grouping method as a method for

   Pollack, Johnson and Knaff (1959) confirmed these
results using temporal grouping (i.e. making a short pause
between the groups when presenting the sequence for the
subjects) for items presented in 1’s, 2’s, 3’s, 4’s and 6’s.                      a’    1     b’   1      c’   1     d1’ 0
