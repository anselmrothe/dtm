intentions. Within the winner-take-all framework, at the
winning intention’s transition from intention to action, the
remaining intentions cease to contend—within the
framework of the model, the procedures that would have
implemented those intentions fail. The occurrence and
timing of the events that drive the intentions determine how
they play out, producing successful behaviors or mistakes
that lead to an incorrect turn on the taxiway. In particular, to
provide a window for error to occur, it was necessary to set
up realistic event chains that prevented the first officer from
providing the prompt on the next turn to the captain.
   As we have suggested, the team-based nature of the taxi
procedures makes them very robust and the challenge has
been to create situations in which mistakes will lead to
error. This effort focused on two error sequences, each
requiring two turns in rapid sequence. For case one, there
were two instances of the same error as crews took high-
speed exit M7 from runway 9R. At the first intersection
after the high-speed exit, each captain turned left toward the
concourse gate rather right away from the gate as directed
by the ground controller. In the second case, there were two
scenarios that shared a similar turn sequence: after turning
onto taxiway F in the first instance and M2 in the second
instance, there was a quick right turn onto taxiway B. In
each of the scenarios, one of the captains turned left rather
than right. The errors were noteworthy, because in
committing the error the captains each turned away from
their intended concourse gate rather than toward the gate as
directed.                                                                    Figure 1: Errors driven by partial knowledge

before the turn. This was a mistake on the part of the
aircrew in the sense that it is always incumbent upon them
to complete an action at the earliest available time, rather
than risk a situation such as this in which there are
contending tasks in process.
   Let us recap the captain’s intentions-to-act as the aircraft
approached the first turn onto taxiway M after the high-
speed exit on taxiway M7. The first officer has been
otherwise occupied and has not provided the captain with
the explicit prompt on the upcoming turn. Based on the
coping strategy described earlier, the captain might have a
correct intention-to-act based on having attended to the
ground controller’s taxi directive and an incorrect intention
based on the expectation of receiving a shortest route to the
concourse gate. Much of the time the coping strategy might
be expected to win the winner-take-all competition and lead
to a correct turn—some of the time the expectation-based
intention-to-act might be acted upon, leading to a taxiway
error. Hence, a reasonable, grounded source for an error
consistent with the T-NASA experiments has been
identified and modeled.
Error Driven by Habit The second scenario examined the
surprising cases in which an aircrew incorrectly turned away
from the shortest course to the gate (see Figure 2). (In
Figure 2, the small arrow denoting the error indicates the
incorrect left turn taken just after the short north-bound
segments near the center of the airport diagrams. It is in red
when viewed in color—in grayscale, it may be difficult to
make out.) The basic intention to take the shortest route to
the gate would have led to the correct behavior, yet it was
not the one acted upon. There were two instances of this
error at similar intersections. In the first case (Figure 2), the
aircraft was proceeding north on taxiway F and had been
instructed to turn right onto taxiway B, but the captain
