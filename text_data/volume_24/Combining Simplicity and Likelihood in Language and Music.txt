Abstract
It is widely accepted that the human cognitive system
organizes perceptual input into complex hierarchical
descriptions which can be represented by tree structures.
Tree structures have been used to describe linguistic,
musical and visual perception. In this paper, we will
investigate whether there exists an underlying model that
governs perceptual organization in general. Our key idea is
that the cognitive system strives for the simplest structure
(the "simplicity principle"), but in doing so it is biased by
the likelihood of previous experiences (the "likelihood
principle"). We will present a model which combines
these two principles by balancing the notion of most likely
tree with the notion of shortest derivation. Experiments
with linguistic and musical benchmarks (Penn Treebank
and Essen Folksong Collection) show that such a
combination outperforms models that are based on either
simplicity or likelihood alone.

that the linguistic tree structure is labeled with syntactic
categories, whereas the musical and visual tree structures
are unlabeled. This is because in language there are
syntactic constraints on how words can be combined into
larger constituents, while in music (and to a lesser extent
in vision) there are no such restrictions: in principle any
note may be combined with any other note.

Introduction
It is widely accepted that the human cognitive system
organizes perceptual input into complex, hierarchical
descriptions which can be represented by tree structures.
Tree structures have been used to describe linguistic
perception (e.g. Chomsky 1965), musical perception (e.g.
Lerdahl & Jackendoff 1983) and visual perception (e.g.
Marr 1982). Yet, there seems to be little or no work which
emphasizes the commonalities between these different
forms of perception and which searches for a general,
underlying mechanism which governs all perceptual
organization (cf. Leyton 2001). This paper aims to study
exactly that question: acknowledging the differences
between linguistic, musical and visual information, is
there a general, unifying model which can predict the
perceived tree structure for sensory input? In studying this
question, we will use a strongly empirical methodology:
any model that we might hypothesize will be tested
against benchmarks such as the linguistically annotated
Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 1993) and the musically
annotated Essen Folksong Collection (Schaffrath 1995).
While we will argue for a unified model of language,
music and vision, we will carry out experiments only with
linguistic and musical benchmarks, since no benchmarks
of visual tree structures are currently available, to the best
of our knowledge.
Figure 1 gives three simple examples of linguistic,
musical and visual input with their corresponding tree
structures given below.
Thus a tree structure describes how parts of the input
combine into constituents and how these constituents
combine into a representation for the whole input. Note

Figure 1: Examples of tree structures.
Apart from these differences, there is also a fundamental
commonality: the perceptual input undergoes a process of
hierarchical structuring which is not found in the input
itself. The main problem is thus: how can we derive the
perceived tree structure for a given input? That this
problem is not trivial may be illustrated by the fact that
the inputs above can also be assigned the following,
alternative tree structures in figure 2.

These alternative structures are possible in that they can
be perceived. But while the alternative tree structures are
all possible, they are not plausible: they do not correspond
to the structures that are actually perceived by the human
perceptual system.
The phenomenon that the same input may be assigned
different structural organizations is known as the
ambiguity problem. This problem is one of the hardest
problems in modeling human perception. Even in
language, where a phrase-structure grammar may specify
which words can be combined into constituents, the
ambiguity problem is notoriously hard. Charniak (1997:
37) argues that almost every sentence from the Wall
Street Journal has many, often more than one million
different parse trees. The ambiguity problem for musical
and visual input is even harder. Talking about rhythm
perception in music, Longuet-Higgins and Lee (1987)
note that "Any given sequence of note values is in
principle infinitely ambiguous, but this ambiguity is
seldom apparent to the listener."

Two principles: likelihood and simplicity
How can we predict from the set of all possible tree
structures the tree that is actually perceived by the human
cognitive system? In the field of visual perception, two
competing principles have traditionally been proposed to
govern perceptual organization. The first, initiated by
Helmholtz (1910), advocates the likelihood principle:
sensory input will be organized into the most probable
organization. The second, initiated by Wertheimer (1923)
and developed by other Gestalt psychologists, advocates
the simplicity principle: the perceptual system is viewed
as finding the simplest perceptual organization (see
Chater 1999 or Van der Helm 2000 for an
overview). These two principles are not only relevant for
visual perception, but also for linguistic and musical
perception. In the following, we briefly discuss these
principles for each modality, after which we go into the
question of how the two principles can be integrated.

Likelihood
The likelihood principle is particularly influential in the
field of natural language processing (see Manning and
Sch√ºtze 1999, for a review). In this field, the most
appropriate tree structure of a sentence is assumed to be
its most likely structure. The likelihood of a tree is usually
computed from the probabilities of its parts (e.g. phrasestructure rules) taken from a large annotated language
corpus (a treebank). A widely used treebank for testing
and comparing probabilistic natural language parsers is
the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus et al.
1993). State-of-the-art probabilistic parsers such as Collins

(2000), Charniak (2000) and Bod (2001a) obtain around
90% precision and recall on the Wall Street Journal. Also
in the field of psycholinguistics, the likelihood principle is
widely used: Jurafsky (1996), Crocker and Brantz (2000)
and Hale (2001) are examples of psycholinguistically
inspired probabilistic parsers.
The likelihood principle has also been applied to
musical perception, e.g. in Raphael (1999) and Bod
(2001b/c). As in probabilistic natural language processing,
the most probable musical tree structure can be computed
from the probabilities of rules or fragments taken from a
large annotated musical corpus, for instance from the
Essen Folksong Collection (Bod 2001b).
In visual perception psychology and vision science,
there has recently been a resurgence of interest in
probabilistic models (e.g. Hoffman 1998; Kersten 1999).
Mumford (1999) has seen fit to declare the Dawning of
Stochasticity.

Simplicity
The simplicity principle has a long tradition in the field of
visual perception psychology (e.g. Restle 1970;
Leeuwenberg 1971; Simon 1972; Buffart et al. 1983; van
der Helm 2000). In this field, a visual pattern is
formalized as a constituent structure by means of a
"visual coding language" based on primitive elements
such as line segments and angles. Perception is described
as the process of selecting the simplest structure
corresponding to the "shortest encoding" of a visual
pattern.
The notion of simplicity has also been applied to
musical perception. Collard et al. (1981) use the coding
language of Leeuwenberg (1971) to predict the metrical
structure for four preludes from Bach's Well-Tempered
Clavier. More well-known in musical perception is the
theory proposed by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) who
use a system of preference rules based on the Gestaltpreferences identified by Wertheimer (1923), and which
can therefore also be seen as an embodiment of the
simplicity principle.
Notions of simplicity also exist in language processing
(e.g. Frazier 1978; Gorrell 1995; Osborne 2000). Bod
(2000a) defines the simplest tree structure of a sentence
as the structure generated by the smallest number of
subtrees from a given treebank.

Combining the two principles
The key idea of the current paper is that both principles
play a role in perceptual organization: the simplicity
principle as a general cognitive preference for economy,
and the likelihood principle as a probabilistic bias due to
previous perceptual experiences. Informally stated, our
working hypothesis is that the human cognitive system
strives for maximal economy (the simplest structure), but
that in doing so it is biased by the likelihood of previous
experiences (in the last section we will discuss some
other combinations of simplicity and likelihood that have
been proposed). To formally instantiate our working
hypothesis, we need a parsing model to start with which
can incorporate these principles. In principle any parsing
model might do, as long as it can assign tree structures to

perceptual input according to some criterion. For the
current paper, we have chosen to start with the DataOriented Parsing model (Bod 1998) because (1) it has
several other models as special cases, such as contextfree parsing models and lexicalized models, and (2) it has
been quite successful in predicting tree structures for both
linguistic input (Bod 2001a) and musical input (Bod
2001b).
The basic idea of DOP is that it learns a grammar by
extracting subtrees from a given treebank and uses these
subtrees to analyze fresh input. Suppose we are given the
following linguistic treebank of only two trees (we will
come back to musical treebanks in the next section),

Figure 4: Parsing a sentence by combining subtrees
Thus the node-substitution operation combines two
subtrees by substituting the second subtree on the leftmost
nonterminal leaf node of the first subtree. Since DOP uses
subtrees of arbitrary size, there are typically several
derivations, involving different subtrees, that produce the
same parse tree; for instance:

The more interesting case occurs when there are different

happens when a sentence is structurally ambiguous; for

The original DOP model in Bod (1993) uses the
likelihood principle to predict the perceived tree structure.
We will refer to this model as L i k e l i h o o d - D O P .
Likelihood-DOP selects the most likely tree structure from
among all possible tree structures on the basis of the
probabilities of its subtrees. The probability of a subtree t
is estimated as the number of occurrences of t seen in the
corpus, divided by the total number of occurrences of
corpus-subtrees that have the same root label as t. The
probability of a derivation is computed as the product of
the probabilities of the subtrees involved in it. Finally, the
probability of a parse tree is equal to the sum of the
probabilities of all distinct derivations that produce that
tree. In Bod (2001a) and Goodman (2002), efficient
algorithms are given that compute for an input string the
most probable parse tree.
Likelihood-DOP does not do justice to the preference
humans display for the simplest structure, e.g. the one that
is generated by the shortest derivation consisting of the
fewest subtrees. This is what we will call Simplicity-DOP.
Instead of producing the most probable parse tree for an
input, Simplicity-DOP produces the parse tree generated
by the fewest corpus-subtrees, independent of the
probabilities of these subtrees. For example, given the
corpus in Figure 3, the simplest parse tree for She saw the
dress with the telescope according to Simplicity-DOP is
given in Figure 5, since that parse tree can be generated
by a derivation of only two corpus-subtrees, while the
parse tree in Figure 6 (and any other parse tree) needs at
least three corpus-subtrees to be generated. In Bod
(2000a) it is shown how the shortest derivation can be
efficiently computed by means of a best-first bottom-up
chart parsing algorithm. Simplicity-DOP obtains quite
impressive results on the WSJ, though its results are lower
than Likelihood-DOP (Bod 2000a). Yet, the set of
correctly predicted parse trees of Simplicity-DOP is not a
subset of the set of correctly predicted parse trees of
Likelihood-DOP. This suggests that we may expect an
accuracy improvement if simplicity and likelihood are
combined into a new model, which we will call
Combined-DOP.
The underlying idea of Combined-DOP is that the
human perceptual system searches for the shortest
derivation (i.e. the simplest tree structure), but that in
doing so it is biased by the "weights" of the subtrees. The
length of a derivation is then not defined simply as the
sum of the derivation steps (as in Simplicity-DOP), but as
the sum of the weights of these steps, where a low weight
should be seen as an easy step and a heavy weight as a

difficult step. As a measure for weight of a subtree, we
have worked out various proposals that were
experimentally tested over the last few years. Most of
these proposals have been reported in the literature (e.g.
Bod 2000a; Cormons 1999). The best measure for subtree
weight so far is based on the rank of a subtree. First, all
subtrees are grouped with respect to their root label. Next,
for each root label the weight of a subtree is defined as its
rank in the frequency ordering in the corpus. Thus, the
most frequent subtree in each ordering gets a weight of 1,
the second most frequent subtree gets a weight of 2, etc.
The weight of a derivation is then defined as the sum of
the weights of the subtrees in the derivation. The
derivation with the lowest weight is taken as the "best"
derivation producing the perceived parse tree. Thus, the
best derivation is not determined by the smallest sum of
the subtrees (as in Simplicity-DOP), but by the smallest
sum of the weights of the subtrees.
We performed one additional adjustment to the weight
of a subtree. This adjustment consists in a smoothing
technique which averages the weight of a subtree by the
weights of its own sub-subtrees. That is, instead of taking
only the rank of a subtree as its weight, we compute the
weight of a subtree as the (arithmetic) mean of the
weights of all its sub-subtrees (including the subtree
itself). The effect of this smoothing technique is that it
redresses a very low-frequency subtree if it contains highfrequency sub-subtrees.

The Test Domains
Our linguistic test domain consists of sections 02-21 of the
Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank, which
contains approx. 40,000 phrase-structure trees. Since the
Penn Treebank has been extensively described in the
literature (e.g. Marcus et al. 1993; Manning & Sch√ºtze
1999), we will not go into it any further here.
The musical test domain consists of the European
folksongs in the Essen Folksong Collection (Schaffrath
1995), which correspond to approx. 6,200 musical
grouping structures. The Essen Folksong Collection has
been previously used by Bod (2001b) and Temperley
(2001) to test their musical parsers. The musical coding
language used in the Essen Folksong Collection is based
on the Essen Associative Code (ESAC). The pitch
encodings in ESAC resemble "solfege": scale degree
numbers are used to replace the movable syllables "do",
"re", "mi", etc. Thus 1 corresponds to "do", 2 corresponds
to "re", etc. Chromatic alterations are represented by
adding either a "#" or a "b" after the number. The plus
("+") and minus ("-") signs are added before the number if
a note falls resp. above or below the principle octave
(thus -1, 1 and +1 refer al to "do", but on different
octaves). Duration is represented by adding a period or an
underscore after the number. A period (".") increases
duration by 50% and an underscore ("_") increases
duration by 100%; more than one underscore may be
added after each number. If a number has no duration
indicator, its duration corresponds to the smallest value. A
pause is represented by 0, possibly followed by duration
indicators. No loudness or timbre indicators are used in
ESAC. The only extra information we (automatically)
added to the grouping structures in the Essen Folksong

Collection consists of the label "S" for each top node of
each whole song and the label "P" for each underlying
phrase. In this way, we obtained conventional parse trees
that can directly be used by our DOP models to parse new
input strings (see also Bod 2001b). The Essen Folksong
Collection is freely available via http://www.esacdata.org.
As mentioned in the introduction, no visual treebank is
currently available, to the best of our knowledge. We are
currently developing a treebank of analyzed architectural
plans, and will report on experiments with that treebank in
due time.

Experimental Evaluation
To evaluate our DOP models, we used the blind testing
method which dictates that a treebank be randomly
divided into a training set and a test set, where the strings
from the test set are parsed by means of the subtrees from
the training set. We applied the PARSEVAL metrics of
precision and recall to compare a proposed parse tree P
with the corresponding correct test set parse tree T (see
Black et al. 1991):
Precision =

# correct constituents in P

Recall =

# constituents in P

# correct constituents in P
# constituents in T

A constituent in P is "correct" if there exists a constituent
in T of the same label that spans the same elements (i.e.
words or notes). To balance precision and recall into a
single measure, we will employ the widely used F-score:
F-score = 2*Precision*Recall / (Precision+Recall).
We will use this F-score to quantitatively evaluate our
models on the Wall Street Journal and the Essen Folksong
treebanks. We divided both treebanks into 10 training/test
set splits, where 90% of the trees was used for training
and 10% for testing. These splits were random, except for
one constraint: that all the primitive elements (i.e. words
and notes) in the test set also occurred in the training set.
In this way, we did not have to worry about unknown
words or unknown notes (the latter being actually
inexistent for our musical treebank). Although there are
various statistical ways to cope with unknown words, we
wanted to rule out this problem as it might obscure our
comparison.
In our experiments we were first of all interested in
comparing the three DOP models (Likelihood-DOP,
Simplicity-DOP and Combined-DOP) on the two domains.
For computational reasons, we limited the maximum size
of the subtrees to depth 14, as in Bod (2001a). Table 1
shows the average F-scores for each of the models.
Table 1: F-scores obtained by the three DOP models

Combined-DOP

Language

91.7%

Music

86.0%

84.3%

86.9%

The table shows that Likelihood-DOP outperforms
Simplicity-DOP, but that Combined-DOP outperforms
Likelihood-DOP. According to paired t-testing, the

improvement of Combined-DOP over Likelihood-DOP was
statistically significant both for language (p<.0001) and
for music (p<.04).
We also performed a series of experiments where we
restricted the size of the subtrees. Recall that by
restricting the subtrees to depth 1, Likelihood-DOP
becomes equivalent to a probabilistic context-free
grammar, while Simplicity-DOP would just return the
smallest possible tree structure. While Likelihood-DOP
still obtained relatively good results at depth 1 for both
language and music (resp. 75.1% and 76.6%), SimplicityDOP scored very badly for language (22.5%) though still
reasonably for music (70.0%). Interestingly, CombinedDOP scored worse than Likelihood-DOP at depth 1 (resp.
68.2% vs. 74.6%). Only after subtree depth 6 for language
and subtree depth 2 for music, Combined-DOP
outperformed Likelihood-DOP. The highest F-scores were
obtained with the "unrestricted" subtrees (in table 1).
Elsewhere we have shown that virtually any constraint
on the subtrees results in an accuracy decrease (Bod
2001a/b). This is because in language, almost any relation
between words (including between so-called nonheadwords) can be important for predicting the perceived
parse tree of a sentence. The same counts for music,
where there is a continuity between "jump-phrases" and
"non-jump-phrases", which can only be captured by large
subtrees (see Bod 2001b/c for an extensive discussion).

Discussion: Other Combinations of Simplicity
and Likelihood
We have seen that our combination of simplicity and
likelihood is quite rewarding for linguistic and musical
perception, suggesting a deep parallel between the two
modalities. Yet, we should raise the question whether a
model which massively stores and re-uses previously
perceived structures has any cognitive plausibility.
Interestingly, there is quite some evidence that people
store various kinds of previously heard fragments, both in
music (Saffran et al. 2000) and language (Jurafsky 2002).
But do people store fragments of arbitrary size, as
proposed by DOP? In his overview article, Jurafsky (2002)
reports on a large body of psycholinguistic evidence
showing that people not only store lexical items and
bigrams, but also frequent phrases and even whole
sentences. For the case of sentences, people not only
store idiomatic sentences, but also "regular" highfrequency sentences. Thus, at least for language it seems
that humans store fragments of arbitrary size provided that
these fragments have a certain minimal frequency.
However, there seems to be no evidence that people store
all fragments they hear, as suggested by DOP. Only highfrequency fragments seem to be memorized. However, if
the human perceptual faculty needs to learn which
fragments will be stored, it will initially need to keep
track of all fragments (with the possibility of forgetting
them) otherwise frequencies can never accumulate. This
results in a model which continuously and incrementally
updates its fragment memory given new input, which is in
correspondence with the DOP approach.
There have been other proposals for integrating or
reconciling the principles of simplicity and likelihood.
Chater (1999) argues that the principles are identical in

the context of Kolmogorov's complexity theory
(Kolmogorov 1965). And in the context of Information
Theory the simplicity principle can be defined in terms of
bit length, such that maximizing likelihood corresponds to
minimizing bit length (cf. Rissanen 1978). First note that
the likelihood principle aims at maximizing the
probability of a structure given an input,
p(structure | input). Next, define the simplicity principle
as minimizing the informatic-theoretical notion of bit
length, which is the (negative) logarithm of the
probability of a structure given an input:
‚àí log p (structure | input). Now it is easy to see that
maximizing p (structure | i n p u t ) leads to the same
structure as minimizing ‚àílog p(structure | input). Thus the
two principles lead to the same result.
However, in the context of DOP we defined the
simplest structure as the one generated by the shortest
derivation consisting of the smallest number of subtrees
(reflecting the smallest number of steps needed to parse
an input). And this notion of simplest structure is provably
different from the most probable structure given an input.
Although it is possible to redefine our notion of simplest
structure in terms of bit length, it would not lead to any
new model, and to no improved result. By conceptually
separating between simplicity and likelihood in DOP and
by combining them in a novel way, we have shown that
an improved model can be obtained.
What we have not done in this paper is to isolate
the perceptual properties for which no prior expectations
are needed. Even Simplicity-DOP, albeit nonprobabilistic, is heavily based on previously perceived
data. It is very likely that there are perceptual grouping
properties for which no prior expectations are necessary.
DOP does not contribute to the discovery of such
properties, but it does neither neglect them, as they are
implicit in the treebank. Bod (2001b) shows that
Wertheimer's Gestalt principles are reflected in about
85% of the phrases in the Essen Folksong Collection
(where phrases have boundaries that fall on large time or
pitch intervals). DOP automatically takes these principles
into account by subtrees that contain such phrases, but
DOP also takes into account phrases whose boundaries do
not fall on large intervals (so-called "jump-phrases"). By
using all subtrees, DOP mimics the preferences humans
have used in analyzing the perceptual data, whatever
these preferences may have been.
