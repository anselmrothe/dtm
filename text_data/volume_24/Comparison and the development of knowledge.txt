Abstract
This paper considers the role of comparison in the
development of knowledge. Results show that comparing
similar objects makes them appear more similar, while
comparing dissimilar objects makes them appear less similar.
The effect of comparison on similar items was especially
striking since subjects judged items to be more similar after
comparison even if the comparison task was to list differences
between the two items. Further, this effect appears specific to
comparison and does not appear to be simply due to a
ìfleshing outî of object representations (listing properties of
two objects without comparing the objects themselves served
to increase the objectsí similarity regardless of whether the
objects were similar or dissimilar to start). This suggests that
comparison may play a special role in partitioning bits of
experience into categories, sharpening categorical boundaries,
and otherwise helping us create conceptual structure above
and beyond that offered by the world.

Introduction
Are our mental representations of things in the world simply
a reflection of the structure of the world, or do we create
new structures and partitions in conceptual space? Further,
are our representations static, or do they change over time in
systematic ways as a result of the way we process and use
our knowledge? This paper suggests that some common
cognitive processes (in this case, comparison) can introduce
systematic biases into our representations of the world.
These biases may be beneficial for separating out bits of
experience into categories, sharpening categorical
boundaries, and otherwise helping us create conceptual
structure above and beyond that offered by the world.
This paper focuses on object similarity. Similarity is a
central construct in explanations of cognition. Explanations
of categorization, induction, learning, and memory all rely
on the construct of similarity. Things that are similar are
likely to end up in the same categories, are likely to support
inductive inferences for each other, will aid in the learning
of other similar things, and serve as good reminders for one
another in memory. But where do similarities come from?
Are similarities between objects apprehended immediately
and automatically, or do they develop as a function of
directed processing and experience?
This question has been taken up seriously in the study
of categorization in the following form: Why do categories
appear to contain similar things? Is it because similar things
tend to end up in the same categories, or is it that putting
two things in the same category makes them appear more
similar? Previous research suggests that both are true. For

example, Goldstone, Lippa, and Schiffrin, (2001) showed
that object representations can change as a result of
category-learning, with objects assigned to the same
categories becoming more similar (see also Kurtz, 1998).
Further, previous research by Gentner and Namy (2000)
suggests that providing children with an opportunity for
comparison may help them in category learning by allowing
them to discover deeper relational similarities between
category members (see also Kurtz & Gentner, 1998).
This paper considers the role of comparison in the
development of similarity. Results of four experiments
suggest that comparison can play an important role in
knowledge development. By making similar things appear
more similar, and dissimilar things appear less similar
comparison may help us partition bits of experience into
categories and sharpen categorical boundaries.
Four experiments explore the effects of comparison on
object representation. Experiments 1 and 2 examine the
effects of comparison on the perceived similarity of similar
and dissimilar objects. Experiment 3 contrasts the effects of
comparison with those of simple ìfleshing outî or
elaboration of object representations. Experiment 4 extends
the findings of Experiments 1and 2 to novel objects.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants 132 Stanford University undergraduates
participated in the study in order to fulfill a course
requirement.
Materials Materials consisted of a one-page questionnaire.
The top of the page contained line-drawings of 4 named
familiar animals (a deer, a horse, a goat, and a donkey) as
shown in Figure 1a. The rest of the page contained three
questions. For 73 participants, the first question asked them
to describe three similarities between two of the animals
(e.g., "Please describe 3 similarities between the goat and
the donkey.") For the other 59 participants, the first
question asked them to describe three differences between
two of the animals (e.g., "Please describe 3 differences
between the goat and the donkey.") Participants were given
three blank lines for their responses. Which two animals
were chosen for comparison was counterbalanced across
subjects such that each pair of adjacent shapes was the focus
of comparison equally often. Which animal was named first
in the comparison was also counterbalanced across subjects.

The last two questions asked participants to rate the
similarity of the two animals they had just compared (e.g.,
"How similar are the goat and the donkey?"), and of the
other two animals (e.g., " How similar are the deer and the
horse?"). Half of the subjects rated similarity for the
previously compared pair first, and the other half rated
similarity for the other pair first. As before, which animal
was named first in each comparison was counterbalanced
across subjects. Subjects rated similarity on a 10-point scale
(1=not similar and 10=very similar).

serves to increase perceived similarity, then it is the ability
to find meaningful similarities (and not just the creation of
an extra feature) that is responsible for the findings of
Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the pictures of four similar
animals used in Experiment 1 were replaced with pictures of
four quite dissimilar objects: a phone, a pretzel, a hat, and a
football.

Procedures The one page questionnaire was embedded in a
larger questionnaire packet which contained many other
pages unrelated to this study. Participants completed the
questionnaire at home on their own time.

Results
Comparing two similar items made people think of them as
more similar. This was true regardless of whether the
comparison involved naming similarities between the two
items (M=6.42 after naming similarities, M=5.93 without
naming similarities, t=2.01, p<.05) or naming their
differences (M=6.69 after naming differences, M=6.30
without naming differences, t=1.89, p<.05). There was an
overall effect of comparison (F(1,130)=7.11, p<.01) and no
interaction between the two comparison types
(F(1,130)=.08, p=.78)).

Discussion
Experiment 1 showed that comparing two things (even
when looking for their differences) can cause people to
discover similarities between the two things. But why
should the similarity of two objects increase after they are
compared, especially if oneís task is to describe their
differences? One possibility is that in the process of finding
and articulating differences, people are also finding
similarities. As shown by Gentner & Markman (1994), the
most meaningful (and easiest to name) differences are those
that are attached to the structural similarities. On this view,
because the process of comparison involves an alignment
between two representational structures (see Markman &
Gentner, 1993a, 1993b, 1996), discovering meaningful
differences involves first establishing the similarities. To
take a particular example, if one wanted to mention that the
goat has a shorter tail than the donkey (a difference), this
makes salient the fact that both animals have tails (a
similarity).
But there could also be a less interesting explanation for
these results. What if similarity only increases after
comparison because people create a new feature for the
things they compare, something like "thing I compared
before." If this is the case, similarity might be increasing
simply because the two things previously compared now
both have this extra feature in common. One way to test
this possibility, is to ask people to carry out comparisons
between things that are so different, that no meaningful
similarities are likely to be found. If comparison no longer

Experiment 2
Method
Participants 61 Stanford University undergraduates
participated in the study in order to fulfill a course
requirement.
Materials Just as in Experiment 1, materials consisted of a
one-page questionnaire. The top of the page contained
pictures of 4 dissimilar objects as shown in Figure 1b. The
rest of the page was constructed just as described for

Experiment 1. The comparison task for all 61 of the
subjects was to name differences between two items.
Procedures The procedures were the same as in Experiment
1.

Results
First, the stimuli in this experiment were indeed perceived
to be much less similar to each other (M=2.60) than those
used in Experiment 1 (M=6.50), F(1,118)=278.9, p<.001.
This was necessary as a manipulation check.
It turned out that comparing two dissimilar objects did
not increase their similarity. In fact, naming differences
between two dissimilar objects actually made participants
think of the objects as less similar (M=2.41), than if they
hadn't compared them before (M=2.79), t=-1.89, p<.05.
This pattern was significantly different from that observed
in Experiment 1 as confirmed in an interaction in a 2x2
repeated measures ANOVA (2 (named differences or not) X
2 (stimuli similar or dissimilar)), F (1,118)=6.90, p=.01.

Discussion
Comparison appears to have different effects on similar and
dissimilar objects. Comparing things that are similar can
lead one to discover new (or highlight old) similarities,
thereby increasing the perceived similarity of the two
objects. Comparing things that are dissimilar on the other
hand, is less likely to lead one to discover similarities (since
there are fewer similarities there to be discovered). Hence,
comparing two dissimilar things may serve to make the
items less similar.
The results of Experiment 2 suggest that the increase in
similarity following comparison in Experiment 1 was not
simply due to subjects creating an extra feature (something
akin to ìthing I compared beforeî) for items they were
asked to compare. A co-history of comparison does not
automatically result in higher similarity. Rather, it seems
that only when meaningful similarities are to be found as a
result of comparison, does comparison increase similarity.
However, there is one concern. At this point, it is not
clear whether the difference observed between Experiments
1 and 2 is specifically a difference brought out by the
process of comparison, or a more general difference
inherent in the items.
It could be that performing
comparisons between items is simply serving to flesh out
their representations, and it could be the differences inherent
in these fleshed-out representations that produce the effects,
and not the way comparison (per se) interacts with the
representations. To explore this possibility, instead of
asking subjects to perform comparisons between items,
Experiment 3 asked subjects to list properties of the items
separately (without comparing the items). This propertylisting task was designed to flesh-out the representations
without invoking the extra step of comparison. One group
of subjects performed this task with the similar items used
in Experiment 1, and another group of subjects performed
the task with the dissimilar items used in Experiment 2.

Experiment 3
Method
Participants 234 Stanford University undergraduates
participated in the study in order to fulfill a course
requirement. Of these, 119 completed the task with similar
items from Experiment 1 and 115 completed the task with
dissimilar items from Experiment 2.
Materials Just as in Experiments 1 and 2, materials
consisted of a one-page questionnaire. The top of the page
contained either pictures of the 4 similar animals shown in
Figure 1a or the 4 dissimilar objects shown in Figure 1b.
Instead of being asked to name differences between two of
the items, participants were asked to name properties of two
of the items separately (e.g., ìPlease describe 3 properties of
the phone.î followed by 3 blank lines for participants to fill
in and further followed by ìPlease describe 3 properties of
the pretzel.î again followed by 3 blank lines.) All of the
counterbalancing and the rest of the page was done just as
described for Experiment 1.
Procedures The procedures were the same as Experiment 1.

Results
Participants judged items to be more similar if they had
previously been asked to name their properties than if they
hadnít. This was true for both the similar items from
Experiment 1 (M=6.34 after naming properties, and M=5.92
without naming properties, t=1.90, p<.05) and the dissimilar
items from Experiment 2 (M=3.37 after naming properties,
and M=2.97 without naming properties, t=2.14, p<.02). This
pattern for the dissimilar items was significantly different
from that observed in Experiment 2 as confirmed in an
interaction in a 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA (2 (items
were focused or not) X 2 (comparison or property-listing)),
F (1,174)=6.817, p=.01.

Discussion
Unlike comparison, listing properties of individual items did
not have a different effect on similar and dissimilar items.
Whereas comparison served to increase the similarity only
for similar items, property-listing increased similarity for
both similar and dissimilar items.
The process of
comparison appears to have the special effect of selectively
increasing the similarity of similar items (and possibly
decreasing the similarity of dissimilar items). Simply
fleshing out the representations (by listing properties) was
not sufficient to have this effect.
It appears that the process of comparison could play a
crucial role in the development of knowledge. However, the
studies so far have only tested the effects of comparison on
familiar items, things that people already have
representations for. Can comparison play a similar role

even when people are just learning about something new?
To investigate this, novel shapes were used in Experiment 4.

between the shapes, and (2) before being asked to verbally
describe the differences, participants were asked to circle
three differences between two of the novel shapes on the
pictures themselves (e.g., "Please circle 3 differences
between Chico and Harpo.") The rest of the page was
constructed and counterbalanced just as for Experiment 1.
Procedures The procedures were the same as Experiment 1.

Results and Discussion
First, a manipulation check: participants indeed judged the
ìsimilarî items in Figure 2a to be more similar (M=3.84)
than the ìdissimilarî items in Figure 2b (M=2.37), F
(1,186)=36.6, p<.001.
The effects of comparison were exactly as predicted by
Experiments 1 and 2. Naming differences between two
similar shapes (Figure 2a), again made people think of the
two shapes as more similar (M=4.09 after naming
differences, and M=3.58 without naming differences,
t=2.83, p<.01). Naming differences between two dissimilar
shapes (Figure 2b), on the other hand made people think of
the two shapes as somewhat less similar (M=2.31 after
naming differences, and M=2.43 without naming
differences, t=-.61, p=.27). The patterns for similar and
dissimilar items were significantly different from each other
as confirmed in an interaction in a 2x2 repeated measures
ANOVA (2 (named differences or not) X 2 (stimuli similar
or dissimilar)), F (1,186)=4.43, p<.05.
It appears that the process of comparison had the same
effect on novel items as it did on familiar items in
Experiments 1 and 2. Comparing two similar novel items
made them appear more similar, while comparing dissimilar
novel items made them appear less similar.

Experiment 4
Method
Participants 188 Stanford University undergraduates
participated in the study in order to fulfill a course
requirement.
Materials Just as in Experiment 1, materials consisted of a
one-page questionnaire. The top of the page contained color
pictures of 4 named novel shapes. One set of questionnaires
used the 4 similar objects shown in Figure 2a, and the other
used the dissimilar objects shown in Figure 2b. The rest of
the page was constructed just as in Experiment 1, with the
following two differences: (1) all of the participants were
asked to focus on differences (none named similarities)

The studies described in this paper examined the effects of
comparison on perceptions of similarity. It appears that
comparison can alter peopleís representations of objects by
leading them to discover (or take note of) new similarities
and differences. In future studies, it would be interesting to
see how long effects of comparison last, and if these effects
also extend to categorization. Previous research by Gentner
and Namy (2000) suggests that this may indeed be the case.
Further studies looking directly at the effects of comparison
on categorization would be an interesting extension of this
research.
Also worthy of further investigation are the interactions
between similarity, structural alignability, and the process of
comparison.
In the studies reported in this paper,
comparison was found to have different effects on similar
versus dissimilar items (making similar items more similar,
and dissimilar items less similar). However, the similar
items used in these experiments were similar in several
different ways: for example, both in terms of surface
features and in deeper structural ways. Since several kinds
of similarity were confounded, it is not clear which of these
aspects contributed to the effect. In future studies it would

be interesting to investigate the separate contributions of
structural and surface similarity as they interact with the
comparison process. These further studies should also shed
more light on why comparison has the effect it does.

Conclusions
Four studies showed that comparing similar objects makes
them appear more similar, while comparing dissimilar
objects makes them appear less similar. This was true for
both novel and familiar objects. The effect of comparison
on similar items was especially striking since subjects
judged items to be more similar after comparison even if the
comparison task was to list differences between the two
items. Further, this effect appears specific to comparison
and does not appear to be simply due to a ìfleshing outî of
object representations. When subjects were only asked to
list properties of objects without comparing the objects
themselves, the perceived similarity of the objects increased
regardless of whether the items were similar or dissimilar to
start. By making similar things appear more similar, and
dissimilar things appear less similar, comparison may play a
special role in category development. Further, it appears
that even incidental conceptual experience (e.g., happening
onto one comparison versus another) can play an important
role in knowledge development.
These results suggest that common cognitive processes
like comparison can introduce systematic biases into our
representations of objects and their similarities. These
biases may be beneficial for separating out bits of
experience into categories, sharpening categorical
boundaries, and otherwise helping us create conceptual
structure above and beyond that offered by the world.
