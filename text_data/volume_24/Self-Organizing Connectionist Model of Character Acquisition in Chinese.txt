children in Grades 4 and 6 do. Finally, Shu, Zhou and Wu
(2000) found that young children develop from early on
phonological awareness of the structures of characters
and the functions of the phonetic and semantic radicals.
Some 4th graders already start to acquire the awareness of
the consistency of phonetic radicals, and by Grade 6 this
awareness becomes more transparent.
       The above-mentioned properties of Chinese
characters and the acquisition profiles therein lend
themselves naturally to connectionist modeling. Given
the discrepancy between regular and irregular characters,
do we need to assume dual mechanisms to handle the two
types of characters in acquisition (as symbolic theorists        Fig.1 Reading comprehension of dog in DISLEX
would like to argue)? Or rather, can we assume a                    (Miikkulainen, 1997; reproduced with author’s permission)

acquisition of both types of characters? Previous research
