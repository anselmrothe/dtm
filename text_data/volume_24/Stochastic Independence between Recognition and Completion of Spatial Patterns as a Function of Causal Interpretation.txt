Dynamic system control (DSC) is a paradigm of great
interest for applied and basic research likewise. In
applied contexts, researchers address questions about
how human operators learn to operate new technical
systems efficiently, how training should be designed, or
what errors operators are likely to commit. In basic
research, DSC is one of the paradigms for studying
implicit learning. It has been argued that subjects
control dynamic systems predominantly with exemplar
knowledge about system states, part of which is
considered implicit (Dienes & Fahey, 1998). This
conclusion was derived from studies with systems
