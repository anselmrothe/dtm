      Abstract
           The approach to consciousness taken by most philosophers is very different from the approach taken by most cognitive
           psychologists, so different that one could be forgiven for wondering if they are talking about the same thing. Most
           philosophers focus on individual psychological states. By contrast, most psychologists focus on properties of cognitive
           systems as a whole such as global workspace or attention. (Some philosophers favour this approach, too, Dennett and
           P. M. Churchland for example.) We will expose some of the peculiarities of the dominant philosophical approach and,
           by looking briefly into what is needed to give an adequate account of consciousness, advance some reasons for
           favouring the approach dominant among psychologists.
                                                                          ignored. (Theorists may add, ë...look red to meí but they do
