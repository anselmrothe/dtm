Abstract
Many real world situations do not offer unambiguous
outcome feedback on how to categorize objects. Models
in the categorization literature have mostly been formulated for tasks with trial-by-trial outcome feedback. We
examined if there was evidence for exemplar memory
also when no external feedback is provided and the criterion is derivative of more abstract knowledge. In a
“teacher-student” task, a teacher learns how to judge the
toxicity of bugs from external outcome feedback and
conveys this knowledge to a student that receives no outcome feedback. The results showed that the students exhibit exemplar effects even if the instructions from the
teachers were in the form of rules.

Introduction
Consider listening to your very first speech by a politician. Your previous knowledge is likely to influence
your attitude towards her or him. Perhaps, already from
childhood your father has imprinted in you that politicians are guided by strictly egoist motives and your
general conceptions thus include a belief that no politician advocates a proposal that does not lay in his or her
personal interest. You hear a short speech that is neutral
in content. Later you listen to another politician. How is
your opinion of this second politician influenced by the
first encounter? You did not receive much useful feedback from the first encounter, as you only listened to a
short neutral speech. However, in your memory the first
politician is stored as a person only interested in pursuing his own interest. This exemplar memory only in
part derives from direct experience with a politician; in
part it is derivative of more general beliefs held prior to
the encounter. However, by now this belief is supported
also by “concrete experience” of politicians.
This was an example of a real world situation that is
different from most categorization experiments where
classification models are tested in tasks with simple
perceptual stimuli and trial-by-trial outcome feedback.
Everyday situations often do not offer direct and unambiguous feedback and exemplar memory is thus likely
to derive in part also from other sources of knowledge
besides concrete experience with the objects.
There has been increasing interest in multiple representation levels (e.g., Ashby, Alfonso-Reese, Turken, &
Waldron, 1998) and there is evidence that people can
adaptively shift between different representation levels

in response to the experimental demands (Jones, Juslin,
Olsson, & Winman, 2000). With experience, knowledge first represented abstractly may be projected onto
concrete exemplars so that in the end the beliefs are
supported also by an extensive exemplar memory: a
phenomenon that might be called pseudo-experience.
Even if some extensions of exemplar models allows
for storage of exemplars as they are interpreted and not
solely in terms of their physical properties (e.g., the
model presented by Smith & Zarate, 1992), the argument supporting this claim is based on general observations and not linked to predictions from different models. For example, one such observation is that a reencounter of a stimulus facilitate the same reactions and
processes (see the review in Smith & Zarate, 1992).
In this paper, we examine the possibility of extending
the scope of exemplar models (Medin & Schaffer,
1978; Nosofsky, 1986) to situations where people do
not receive outcome feedback, but form beliefs about
the criterion from abstract knowledge of rules. In these
circumstances, one possibility is that people completely
abandon exemplar processes as a basis for their judgments and directly use abstract knowledge in the form
of rules or prototypes.
Another possibility is that people generate the criteria
from abstract knowledge and store them together with
the experienced exemplars; later to rely on these stored
exemplars to make their judgments. We explore these
possibilities in a “teacher-student” task where a teacher
learns how to judge the toxicity of bugs from outcome
feedback and the student has to rely on feedforward
summary information provided by the teacher. The
question is if there is evidence for exemplar processing
in the students judgments even if they do not receive
feedback or instructions about exemplars from the
teachers.

Measuring Exemplar Effects
To develop an exemplar effect index we need to consider a category structure that allows us to differentiate
between predictions by the exemplar model and other
plausible models, in this case a cue-abstraction model
that linearly integrates cues. The results previously
obtained with this task revealed large individual differences and a shift from exemplar memory to more mental cue-integration processes when the criterion is
changed from classification to a continuous judgment
task (Juslin, Olsson, & Olsson, 2002).

The task requires participants to use four binary cues
to infer a continuous criterion. (Juslin et al., 2002). The
judgments involve the toxicity of subspecies of a fictitious Death Bug. The different subspecies vary in concentration of poison from 50 ppm (harmless) to 60 ppm
(lethal). The toxicity can be inferred from four visual
cues of the subspecies (e.g., the length of their legs,
color of their back).
The binary cues C1, C2, C3, and C4 take on values 1
or 0. The toxicity c of a subspecies is a linear, additive
function of the cue values:
(1)
c = 50 + 4 ⋅ C1 + 3 ⋅ C 2 + 2 ⋅ C 3 + 1 ⋅ C 4 .
C1 is the most important cue with coefficient 4 (i.e., a
relative weight .4), C2 is the second to most important
with coefficient 3, and so forth. A subspecies with feature vector (0, 0, 0, 0) thus has poison concentration 50
ppm; a subspecies with feature vector (1, 1, 1, 1) has 60
ppm. The continuous criteria for all 16 subspecies (i.e.,
possible cue configurations) are summarized in Table 1.

that only requires participants to judge if a bug is dangerous or not, the probability p E (bˆ = 1) of categorization as dangerous (1) equals the ratio between the
summed similarity of the judgment probe to the dangerous exemplars and the summed similarity to all
exemplars:

j (j=1…J), S(p,xj) is the similarity between the probe p
and exemplar xj, and bj is the binary criterion stored
with exemplar j (bj=1 for dangerous, bj=1 for harmless).
J depends on the size of training set of exemplars.
The similarity between probe p and exemplar xj is
computed by the multiplicative similarity rule of the

In training, the participants encounter 11 subspecies
and make continuous judgments about the toxicity of
each subspecies (“The amount of poison is 57%”). As
indicated in the two right-most columns of Table 1, five
subspecies are omitted in training. In a test phase, the
participants make the same judgments as in the training
phase, but for all the 16 subspecies and without feedback. The task allows perfect performance in training
both by exemplar memory and induction of the task
structure (i.e., by inducing the cue weights in Eq. 1).
The exemplar model implies that participants make
judgments by retrieving similar exemplars (subspecies)
from long-term memory. The context model of classification (Medin & Schaffer, 1978) suggests that in a task

where di is an index that takes value 1 if the cue values on cue dimension i coincide (i.e., both are 0 or both
are 1), and si if they deviate (i.e., one is 0, the other is
1). si are four parameters in the interval [0, 1] that capture the impact of deviating cues (features) on the overall perceived similarity S(p,xj). si close to1 implies that
a deviating feature on this cue dimension has no impact
at all on the perceived similarity and is considered irrelevant. si close to 0 means that the overall similarity
S(p,xj) is close to 0 if this feature is deviating, assigning
crucial importance to the feature. The parameters si
capture the similarity relations between stimuli and the
attention paid to each cue dimension, where a lower si
signifies higher attention.
The context model was developed for classification,
in most cases to binary categories. To generate predictions also for judgments of a continuous criterion we
relax the model by allowing the outcome index bj to
take not only binary but also continuous values. The
estimate ĉ E of the criterion c is a weighted average of
the criteria cj stored for the exemplars, where the similarities S(p,xj) are weights (see e.g., Juslin & Persson,
2000; Smith & Zarate, 1992, for similar applications).
The cue-abstraction model assumes that the participants abstract explicit cue-criterion relations in training,
which are mentally integrated at the time of judgment.
When presented with a probe the participants retrieve
rules connecting cues to the criterion from memory
(e.g., “Green back goes with being poisonous”). The
rules specify the sign of the relation and the importance
of each cue with a cue weight. For example, after training the rule for cue C1 may specify that C1=1 goes with
a large increase in the toxicity of a subspecies.
Cue abstraction implies that participants compute an
estimate ĉ R of the continuous criterion c. For each cue,
the appropriate rule is retrieved and the estimate of c is

adjusted according to the cue weight ω i (i=1…4). The
final estimate ĉ R of c is a linear additive function of
the cue values Ci,
4

cˆ R = k + ∑ ω i ⋅ C i ,

(2)

i =1

where k = 50 + .5 ⋅ (10 − ∑ ω i ) . If ω 1 =4, ω 2 =3, ω 3 =2,
and ω 4 =1, Eq’s 1 and 2 are identical and the model
produce perfect judgments. The intercept k constrains
the function relating judgments to criteria to be regressive around the midpoint (55) of the interval [50, 60]
specified by the task instructions.

rather than new exemplars are more accurate, the index
is negative. The extrapolation index EI is the mean
deviation from linear extrapolation,

EI = 51 50

where x 50 , x 51 , x 59 , and x 60 are the judgments for
exemplars with criteria 50, 51, 59 and 60, respectively.
The value of b is determined by the difference x 51 - x 50
(or equivalently x 60 - x 59 ) predicted by a linear regression relating judgments to criteria. Perfect linear extrapolation implies an extrapolation index that is 0 (e.g.,
when the judgments are perfectly accurate). If the index
is negative, the exemplars with extreme criteria do not
receive as extreme judgments as implied by linear extrapolation. For example, the indices in Figures 1A are
0, but the indices in Figure 1B are negative. The mean
of ∆ON and EI provides a total index of exemplar effects, Total EE.

Figure 1: Panel A: Cue abstraction model predictions
for the constrained training set. Panel B: Exemplar
model predictions with similarity parameter s=.1 for the
constrained training set. O = Old comparison exemplar
in training, N = New comparison exemplar presented at
test, E = Extrapolation exemplars.
The predictions from the two models are summarized
in Figure 1 and shows that the models predict distinct
patterns. The cue abstraction model allows accurate
extrapolation beyond the distribution of criteria in the
training set [51, 59]. Whenever the correct signs of the
cue weights are identified, the most extreme judgments
are made for exemplars 1 and 16. The exemplar model,
that computes a weighted average of the criteria observed in training, can never produces a judgment outside the observed range. The most extreme judgments
are made for criteria c=51 and 59.
Moreover, with cue abstraction there should be no
systematic differences between judgments for “New”
and “Old” exemplars with c=55, 56, and 57: the process
is the same in both cases. However, with the exemplar
model there is more accurate judgments for Old exemplars, because these judgments benefit from retrieval of
identical exemplars with the correct criterion.
These differences in predictions allow us to define
measures of the amount of exemplar processing. First,
The old-new difference index ∆ON is defined as,
(6)
∆ON = d Old − d New
where d Old is the mean absolute deviation between
judgment and criterion for the three old exemplars and
d New is the corresponding mean deviation for the three
new exemplars in Table 1. When judgments for old

Participants
Forty undergraduate students participated. The participants were paid between 50 and 100 SEK depending on
their performance.

Apparatus and Materials
The experiment was carried out on a PC–compatible
computer. The exemplars varied in terms of four binary
cues; leg length (short or long), nose length (short or
long), spots or no spots on the fore back and two patterns on the back. The cues and the cue values in the
abstract structure in Table 1 were randomly assigned to
new concrete visual features for each new participant.
Two types of presentation modes were used, one analogue where drawings of the bugs were presented and
one propositional with written descriptions of the bugs.

Design and Procedure
The task was done in pairs, one participant in each pair
was randomly assigned as teacher and the other as student. Half of the teacher-student pairs were randomly
assigned to the analogue condition and the other half to
the propositional condition.
The written instructions informed the participants
that the task involved judgments of the toxicity of subspecies of a Death bug from 50 to 60 ppm and that the
difference between teachers and students was that the
teacher receives outcome feedback and that the student
does not. The participants were also informed that they
would receive a minimum payment of 50 SEK and up
to 100 SEK depending on the performance of the student. The performance bonus was calculated by taking
half the correlation between the students’ judgments
and the criterion values in the test phase times 100. In
addition, the teacher was told that after each training
block they were to write down instructions to the stu-

Figure 3 shows that there appears to be some exemplar
effects in all the conditions, for both teachers and students. The judgments of the new exemplars are less
accurate than the old exemplars and underestimate the
criteria. The figure also shows that both teachers and

dent on how to assess the toxicity of the bugs as a Word
file. The teachers were free to give any instructions they
wanted. The word files were collected for further analysis by the experimenter. No additional contacts between
teachers and students were allowed (except for strictly
clarifying questions in regard to spelling errors, as mediated by the experimenter).
The training phase consisted of four blocks with 55
trials each making a total of 220 trials. Only the teacher
received outcome feedback of the correct toxicity level
in the learning phase. After each training block the
teacher wrote down instructions to the student and the
experimenter handed it over to the student that were
seated in another room. In the test phase each exemplar
were presented four times without feedback for both
teachers and students making a total of 64 trials. The
entire experiment took from one hour and fifteen minutes to two hours.

We coded the instructions the teachers gave the students as containing exemplars or not by a strict coding

short legs, long nose, no spots = 51%”. A typical part of

an instruction that did not contain exemplar instruction
was “Begin with 50% and add: short grey legs
+2…green long legs +0 [and so on for all the cues]”.

In this paper, we have shown that people can spontaneously rely on pseudo-experience in a judgment task.
Even when the information people receive does not
contain information about specific exemplars, people
cannot help project abstract rule knowledge onto concrete exemplars and then use these exemplars in the
judgment process.
Even if there are large individual differences in data
with some people operating only in accordance with the
cue-abstraction model, it seems difficult for most people to totally abandon exemplar processing. Even if you
initially execute a rule to determine what response you
will make, the very act of executing the rule implies
processing the exemplar in front of you. For example,
you need to scan the object for features that fit the rule
conditions. Even if you do not consciously trying to
remember exemplars, the end result is incidental learning of exemplars that later influences judgments.
One caveat is that the types of categories used could
affect the prevalence of exemplar based processing. For
example, the results in a series of experiments by
Minda, Smith and colleagues (e.g., Minda & Smith,
2001) suggest that larger categories, better structured
categories, and more complex stimulus promotes prototype processing at the expense of exemplar processing.
In this, and other tasks, rule based representations
provide great powers of generalization and communication. One answer why we sometimes cannot avoid storing and using exemplars may be found in the idea that
our cognitive system consists of multiple levels of representation that work together or compete to determine
responses in specific tasks (see e.g., Ashby et al., 1998).
Our results fit into the notion that the exemplar representation has a function that separates it from other
representational formats in that it acts like an automatically activated back-up system that preserves distributional and individuating information about the world.
