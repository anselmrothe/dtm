Abstract
Natural language comprehension involves processing a
multitude of words that vary along many dimensions, some
of which may reflect statistical regularities in language.
These variables may differ in their relative importance
across various types of words and tasks. This study used a
multiple regression approach to investigate potentially
important predictors of noun-verb processing across
naming, grammatical categorization, and sentence
completion tasks. Although there were some indications
of different predictors for nouns vs verb processing, the
strongest predictors of response latencies were primarily
determined by the types of processing most important for a
given task. One variable of particular interest was the
newly created Noun-Verb Distributional Difference
(NVDD) metric developed by Chiarello et al. (1999).
NVDD values reflect statistical regularities in language
regarding the typicality of the contexts in which nouns
and verbs tend to occur. The results suggest that although
noun-verb typicality, as assessed via the NVDD, is a valid
measure of regularities in noun-verb contexts within a
linguistic corpus, individuals may not be very sensitive to
this dimension in standard psycholinguistic processing
tasks.

Introduction
Single word recognition is a central component of language
processing. The typical approach has been to use a naming
or lexical decision (LD) task and a factorial design to
investigate the processing effect of one or more variables
such as familiarity or imageability while holding other
potentially confounding variables constant. In addition,
most single word recognition research has tended to use
words of different parts of speech without considering
grammatical class (e.g., nouns vs. verbs), or has focused on
concrete,
imageable
nouns.
Natural
language
comprehension, however, involves processing a multitude of
words varying along many dimensions. These dimensions
may be relatively more or less important for various word
types, and their relative importance is likely to vary across
different forms of language processing (e.g., word
pronunciation vs grammatical identification vs sentence
integration).
With a few exceptions (e.g., Balota & Chumbley, 1984;
Balota, Cortese, & Pilotti, 1999), there have been few
attempts to investigate the relative importance of various
orthographic and semantic dimensions for responding to

words across tasks using multiple regression procedures.
This approach provides the opportunity to study many
variables simultaneously, to determine which lexical
dimensions account for the greatest amount of variance in
reaction time (RT) and accuracy for a particular task, and to
assess whether the variance accounted for is unique, or is
shared by other variables.
Such a regression approach was used in the present study
to investigate the relative importance of different lexical
dimensions across three language tasks. To our knowledge
no prior regression study has examined whether various
predictor variables are equally applicable to words of
different grammatical class. This is an important issue
because neuropsychological research has shown that nouns
and verbs appear to be processed differently in the brain
(e.g., Daniele et al., 1994; Koenig & Lehmann, 1996;
Sereno, 1999). It is unclear whether these differences are due
to neurally separate noun and verb processing systems, or
whether these processing differences are mainly due to
different semantic dimensions that covary with word class.
Investigating several potentially relevant dimensions using a
regression approach may be informative regarding these
processing differences between nouns and verbs.
One possible reason word recognition research has
generally been limited to concrete, imageable nouns, is the
lack of word norming corpora available for other word types.
A recent study by Chiarello, Shears, and Lund (1999),
however, provides imageability ratings, frequency values
from the Usenet text corpus of the Lund and Burgess (1996)
Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL) model, and a new
measure of noun-verb distributional typicality (the NounVerb Distributional Difference, NVDD, metric), for a set of
1197 words: 555 “pure” nouns, 427 “pure” verbs, and 215
words “balanced” for noun-verb usage, as classified by the
Francis and Kucera (FK, 1982) norms.

Noun-Verb Distributional Typicality
The new measure of noun-verb usage developed by
Chiarello et al. (1999) uses context vectors from the Lund
and Burgess (1996) HAL model, where words occurring in
similar phrasal and sentential contexts are nearby in high
dimensional context space. Context distances were
computed between each word and each of the 555 “pure”
nouns (according to Francis & Kucera, 1982) and averaged
to get a mean noun context distance score. Mean verb
distance scores were similarly obtained by computing and

averaging the context distances between each word and the
427 “pure” verbs (Francis & Kucera, 1982). The mean verb
context distance was then subtracted from the mean noun
context distance, for each word, resulting in a measure
referred to as NVDD (Noun-Verb Distributional Difference),
indicating the extent to which the word occurs in contexts
that are more typical of nouns or verbs. Chiarello et al.
(1999) validated the NVDD measure by demonstrating their
strong correlation with Francis & Kucera (1982) estimates of
noun-verb usage, as well as by examining actual part of
speech occurrences for a subset of words in sentence contexts
from the Usenet corpus.
The NVDD measure is purely computational, however,
reflecting statistical regularities of noun-verb usage in the
language corpus. Given the
many
compelling
demonstrations of how information about statistical
regularities in a learner’s environment can be extracted to
result in the learning of various language phenomena (e.g.,
Elman, 2001; Saffran, 2001a,b), it was of interest to
determine whether the NVDD is psychologically relevant for
language processing. We therefore examined whether
individuals would demonstrate a sensitivity to the
contextual typicality of nouns and verbs in their performance
on psycholinguistic tasks. The present paper further
investigates the psychological validity of NVDD across
three different linguistic tasks, whose findings can be
compared with our previous lexical decision results.

Prior Lexical Decision Results
Kacinik, Shears, and Chiarello (2000) reported regression
results investigating the influence of imageability (ease with
which a word arouses a mental image), word length,
experiential familiarity, NVDD, and 2 measures of frequency
(FK, 1982, and Usenet corpus) on noun and verb lexical
decision (LD) response times (RTs).
The results indicated that noun-verb typicality (NVDD)
accounted for a significant portion of verb RT on its own,
but it did not account for any unique variance with the other
variables in the model. For nouns, the opposite occurred,
such that NVDD did account for a small, but significant
portion of unique variance. These LD results only partially
support the psychological relevance of the recently
developed NVDD metric, because it was not a very
important predictor. LD, however, requires discriminating
words from nonwords, and as nouns and verbs are both
words, noun-verb typicality may not really be a relevant
dimension for making this discrimination. Experiments 2
and 3 of the current study investigated grammatical
categorization and sentence completion tasks, both of which
should involve language processes for which noun-verb
typicality could be more relevant.
The LD results also showed different variables to be more
or less important for predicting noun vs. verb RT.
Specifically, imageability appeared to be a more important
predictor for verb responses, whereas frequency appeared to
be more important for nouns. Most importantly, however,
the results indicated that although frequency, imageability,

and NVDD could each account for a portion of the RT
variance individually, they failed to account for much unique
variance.
The biggest predictor of RT was familiarity, individually
accounting for 50% or 60% of the variance, for nouns and
verbs, respectively. Moreover, when contributions of the
other variables were partialled out, around half of the RT
variance accounted for by familiarity appeared to be unique
(33% for nouns and 30% for verbs). Familiarity’s
importance in predicting LD RTs is not surprising (e.g.,
Balota et al., 1999; Gernsbacher, 1984), suggesting that
familiarity is probably the most important dimension for
discriminating between words and nonwords. More
surprising, however, was that about half of the variance
accounted for by familiarity was unique.
To continue examining predictors of noun-verb
processing, and the psychological relevance of the NVDD
metric across various linguistic processes, Experiment 1
examined word naming, Experiment 2 involved noun-verb
decision, and Experiment 3 investigated sentence
completion.

Experiment 1
This experiment investigated which variables would be the
most important predictors for noun and verb naming
latencies. Word naming entails activating phonological
representations to produce a vocal pronunciation response,
and is not thought to require much semantic processing
(Balota et al., 1999). This is in contrast to lexical decision,
as well as the grammatical categorization and sentence
completion tasks examined in Experiments 2 and 3, which
mainly involve activating semantics to make a decision and
subsequent key press response. Familiarity, frequency, and
length were expected to be most influential because of their
likely importance in the initial recognition processes
involved in activating phonological representations (Balota
et al., 1999). In addition, because nouns and verbs primarily
differ in meaning and grammatical class, we did not expect
differences for the relative importance of predictor variables
in this pronunciation task.

Method
Mean latencies from Spieler and Balota’s (1997) young
adult naming corpus were obtained for 251 nouns and 131
verbs found in our database of 1197 words. Spieler and
Balota report that these mean RTs were obtained from 31
Washington University undergraduates (mean age = 22.6),
who named a total of 2870 monosyllabic words.
The word length, NVDD, FK and Usenet frequencies,
imageability, and familiarity values for each of these words
were taken from the Chiarello et al. (1999) database. These
6 predictor variables were combined with the Spieler and
Balota naming latencies as the dependent variable.

Results and Discussion
The multiple regression results for noun and verb naming
latencies are shown in Table 1. When all 6 variables were in

Note: R2 = .21, F(6, 245) = 10.57, p<.0001, for nouns, and R2 = .12, F(6, 121) = 2.87, p<.05, for verbs
the regression, they significantly accounted for 21% of the
RT variance for nouns, and only 12% of variance for verbs.
It thus appears that the lexical dimensions typically thought
to influence word naming are relatively more important for
nouns than verbs. Further examination of the results,
however, suggests that although both frequency measures
appear to be additionally influential for nouns, they do not
account for any unique variance. The variance they account
for appears to be subsumed by length and familiarity.
Indeed, the main conclusion from these results is that
similar dimensions (length and familiarity) were most
important predictors for both noun and verb RTs. These
findings are in contrast to the previous LD results where,
after familiarity, there was some indication that different
predictors were important for noun vs verb processing. This
suggests that noun-verb processing differences are due to
semantics and/or result from postlexical processing.
NVDD was not found to be a significant predictor for
noun latencies, and was only marginally significant for
verbs, accounting for 2% unique variance. Thus, both the
LD and naming results provide minimal support that
individuals are sensitive to regularities in the contexts in
which nouns and verbs occur. Another possibility is that
neither of these tasks involves explicitly activating word
class information. Perhaps a task that does require explicit
activation of noun or verb meaning and/or grammatical class
information, will show greater effects of noun-verb
typicality.

Experiment 2
This experiment investigated the relevance of the typicality
of contexts in which nouns and verbs tend to occur (NVDD)
for deciding whether a word is a noun or verb. In contrast to
LD and naming, this task requires the explicit activation of

grammatical class information in order to make the nounverb decision.

Method
Participants
Forty native English speaking University of California,
Riverside undergraduates (20 males) participated in the
experiment in exchange for course credit or pay ($6.00).
Stimuli
The same set of 152 nouns and 137 verbs, varying in
NVDD, from Kacinik et al. (2000) were employed here.
Procedure
Each trial began with the presentation of a 400 ms fixation
point, followed by 100 ms blank screen, which was
followed by presentation of the target word. Participants
were required to decide whether each item was a noun or a
verb by making a button press response as quickly as
possible. Targets remained on the screen until they
responded, and the inter-trial interval was 1500 ms.
Participants were told that nouns were words naming a
quality, person, place, or thing, while verbs are words that
express an action or the occurrence of an event, and given
some examples of each. Fifteen practice trials preceded the
experiment.

Results and Discussion
The noun and verb multiple regression analyses are
presented in Table 2. When all the variables were included
in the regression model, it was better at predicting nounverb decision than naming latency, such that 44% of the RT

Note: R2 = .44, F(6, 144) = 18.57, p<.0001, for nouns, and R2 = .40, F(6, 123) = 14.39, p<.0001, for verbs
variance for nouns, and 40% of the RT variance for verbs,
was accounted for.
For nouns, imageability followed by NVDD was the most
significant predictor of noun-verb decision times. Although
familiarity individually accounted for 5% of the noun RT
variance, it was not found to contribute a significant amount
of unique variance. Imageability and NVDD were also the
most important predictors of unique variance for verbs.
Familiarity was also a strong predictor of verb latency on its
own, but in contrast to the noun results, it also accounted
for a small significant unique amount of variance.
Imageability therefore appears to be the most influential
dimension for deciding whether a word is a noun or a verb.
Furthermore, much of imageability’s contribution and the
variance it accounts for seems to be unique. There is also
some indication that imageability is more important for
nouns than verbs in the noun-verb decision task. This is
contrary to the LD results, where imageability appeared
somewhat more important for verbs. A possible explanation
for these results is that since nouns are generally more
imageable than verbs, a highly imageable concrete word
encountered in the context of the noun-verb decision task
must be a noun and could be responded to very rapidly
(Chiarello et al., 1999). A negative correlation should thus
be expected between imageability and decision latencies for
verbs, because low imageability words are more likely to be
verbs (Chiarello et al., 1999), and should be responded to
quickly. The obtained correlation, however, was positive,
suggesting that imageability does not facilitate the nounverb decision per se. Instead, we suggest it facilitates earlier
processes such as the speed of word meaning activation,
enabling subsequent noun-verb decisions to be made more
rapidly.
As expected, noun-verb typicality (NVDD) was
significantly correlated with both noun and verb decision

latencies (r = .21, p<.01, and r = -.32, p<.0001,
respectively). Given that noun-verb decision does explicitly
involve processing part of speech information, it is
surprising that NVDD was not more important and only
accounted for 3% and 7% unique variance for nouns and
verbs, respectively. Recall, however, that the NVDD is a
measure of the typicality of contexts in which nouns and
verbs occur. All tasks investigated thus far involved single
word processing, and may not reflect the influence of the
fundamentally contextual nature of the NVDD metric. It is
possible that NVDD may be most relevant for processing
words in sentence contexts.

Experiment 3
This experiment investigated whether noun-verb contextual
typicality would influence response speed for deciding
whether a word could be sensibly integrated into an
incomplete sentence. If sentence context is assumed to
constrain possible completions, faster latencies would be
expected for words that are highly typical nouns or verbs
than for words less typical of their grammatical class.

Method
Participants
Forty native English speaking University of California,
Riverside undergraduates (20 males) participated in the
experiment in exchange for course credit or pay ($6.00).
Stimuli
Incomplete sentence frames, which could be sensibly
completed by either a high or low NVDD noun or verb,
were created. For example, punish and smack are high and
low NVDD verb completions for “the father wanted to

______ his son”, respectively, and tavern and pub are high
and low typicality noun completions for “They walked into
the ______”. We created such incomplete sentences for 80
verbs (40 high and 40 low) and 88 nouns (44 high and low)
from the set of 152 nouns and 137 verbs used by Kacinik et
al. (2000). Sentences were normed and balanced for
sensibility and cloze probability. Nonsensical completions
were created by re-pairing sentence frames and target words
(e.g., She had to punish the text).
Procedure
Each trial began with the presentation of a 500 ms fixation
point, immediately followed by the appearance of the
incomplete sentence. After 1200 ms, the target word
appeared above the sentence, allowing participants enough
time to read the sentence prior to the target’s appearance.
Both the sentence and target word remained on the screen
until they responded. Participants had to decide whether the
target word was a sensible completion to the sentence and
responded by pressing a key as quickly and accurately as
possible. The inter-trial interval was 1000 ms. Twenty-four
practice trials were completed prior to the experiment.

Results and Discussion
Table 3 presents results from regression analyses for the
related condition (i.e., when the noun or verb was a good
completion to the sentence). Contrary to our predictions,
noun-verb contextual typicality (NVDD) was not found to
be relevant for sentence integration, a task where it was
expected to strongly influence processing. Indeed, it is
surprising that with the exception of Usenet frequency for
nouns (r = -.22, p<.01) and imageability for verbs ( r = -.25,
p<.01), none of the variables were significantly correlated
with decision latencies. Noun RT did not correlate with
NVDD (r = -.18, ns), imageability ( r = -.20, ns), length ( r =

.07, ns), FK freq (r = -.12, ns), and familiarity (r = -.11,
ns). Verb RT was also not correlated with NVDD (r = -.16,
ns), length ( r = .09, ns), FK freq (r = -.01, ns), Usenet freq
(r = -.10, ns), and familiarity (r = -.11, ns). These results
suggest that lexical- semantic dimensions identified as being
important for single word recognition are much less relevant
for integrating words into sentences. Indeed, when all the
variables are in the regression model, they only account for a
marginally significant (13%) portion of variance for nouns,
and a non-significant 12% of the variance for verbs.
One possible explanation is that these are lexical
variables, representing characteristics of single words, and
this task is primarily measuring sentence integration. The
nature of the sentence, therefore, is also an important source
of variance for this task. Indeed, it may even be the most
important, suggesting that perhaps “sentence-level
variables” such as sentence length, imageability, or
meaningfulness, would be better predictors of decision
latency. Another possibility is that these lexical variables
are still important for initial word recognition and meaning
activation, but that their influence dissipates once a word
has been recognized, such that they are not involved in
higher-level sentence integration processes. This would
predict these lexical dimensions, and possibly NVDD, to
significantly contribute to initial word recognition processes
that happen in on-line sentence comprehension.

General Discussion
The relative influence of variables on processing nouns and
verbs in naming, noun-verb decision, and sentence
completion tasks was investigated. There were some
indications in our previous lexical decision results that, after
familiarity, different dimensions might vary in terms of their
relative importance for noun versus verb processing.

Although the present study also found some evidence that
different variables were relatively more important for the
processing of nouns vs verbs across tasks, these differences
were fairly subtle. They generally involved differences in the
strengths of relationships between variables and RT, or in
the unique amount of variance accounted for by each
variable. Thus, the main conclusion from this study should
be that the strongest predictors of RT do not depend on
word class per se, but are determined primarily by the type
of processing necessary for a given task. Specifically, word
length and familiarity were most important for naming both
nouns and verbs, familiarity is the most important
dimension for discriminating words and nonwords
(regardless of whether the item is a noun or verb),
imageability and noun-verb typicality were most relevant for
deciding whether a word is a noun or verb, and imageability
was the most relevant lexical variable for integrating words
into sentences.
A variable of particular interest in the current study was
the typicality of contexts in which nouns and verbs tend to
occur, as measured by Chiarello et al.’s (1999) recent
NVDD metric. Despite the fact NVDD captures statistical
regularities of noun-verb usage based on the typicality of
contexts in which they tend to occur (Chiarello et al.,
1999), it does not seem very relevant for the processing of
nouns and verbs across a variety of tasks. Some results did
find noun-verb typicality to correlate with lexical and nounverb decision latencies. In these cases, however, part of that
correlation with RT was also accounted for by other
variables, such that the unique portions of variance
accounted for by NVDD were rather small. This was true
even in tasks where noun-verb typicality was expected to
influence processing.
There is no doubt that individuals are sensitive to some
statistical regularities present in the language environment,
many of which can affect processing (e.g., Saffran, 2001a),
The present findings suggest, however, that this may not be
true for all such regularities. The typicality of contexts in
which nouns and verbs tend to occur, as measured via
NVDD, appears to be a valid regularity within a linguistic
corpus. Yet individuals may not be very sensitive to this
dimension in standard psycholinguistic tasks.
