Setting Connection Weights and Initial
Activations
Initially, the connection weight between an attribute
and an alternative node (called attribute-alternative
weight from now on) is set to the rating of the
alternative on the corresponding attribute. For
example, in Figure 2, the option Target is rated 8 and
2 on performance and gas mileage, respectively, so
its initial weights are set to 8.0 and 2.0 for the
performance-target         and       gas-mileage-target
connections, respectively.
   Next, each initial weight is normalized:
                ( wij − min(w)).(κ − η )
     wij = η +                           .     (1)

Huber et al. (1982) showed that when the additional
alternative (a dominated decoy) is similar to and
obviously inferior to one of the alternatives (the
target) of the original choice set, the introduction of
this decoy will increase the probability of the target
being chosen more than that of the competitor. This
effect can potentially increase the probability that the
target is chosen, thereby leading to violation of an
axiom of rational choice, the regularity principle,
which states that adding additional alternatives into
the choice set would not increase the choice
probabilities of options in the original choice set (cf.
Huber et al., 1982). The violation of the regularity
principle is a stronger form of preference reversal
than the violation of independence of irrelevant
alternatives.
