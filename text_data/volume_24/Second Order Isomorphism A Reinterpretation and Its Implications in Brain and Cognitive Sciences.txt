is assigned to the relation arrow. Notice that the INVOKE arrow is a single arrow, not one arrow going into and another leaving out
of the box. Thus, the rounded box signifies that the arrow actually performs an action. ( ) Backward relational arrows are added
in the brain to account for the mutual, but directional nature of relations. With two relational arrows, both spatial and temporal
relations can be implemented. ( ) The neural counterparts of ( ) are shown. The limiting term representation is removed, and the
