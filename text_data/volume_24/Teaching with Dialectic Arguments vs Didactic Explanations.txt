1. Mr. Burger for Plaintiff (CATO): Your Honor, where plaintiff adopted security measures [F6] and defendant knew
     that plaintiff's information was confidential [F21], even though plaintiff disclosed its product information in
     negotiations with defendant [Fl], plaintiff should win a claim of trade secrets misappropriation, as in The Boeing
     Company v. Sierracin Corporation, 108 Wash.2d 38, 738 P.2d 665 (1987).
2. Judge (to Defendant’s counsel): Your response, Mr. Mason?
3. <STUDENT (selecting from menu): Distinguish Boeing [F15] [F16] [F18] (Continue)>
     Mr. Mason for Defendant (Student): The Boeing Company v. Sierracin Corporation is distinguishable, Your
     Honor, because in the Lynchburg Lemonade case, plaintiff's product information could be learned by reverse-
     engineering [F16]. This was not so in Boeing. Boeing is also distinguishable, because in the Lynchburg Lemonade
     case, unlike Boeing, defendant's product was identical to plaintiff's [F18] and plaintiff was the only manufacturer
     making the product [F15].
4. Judge (to Plaintiff’s counsel): Mr. Burger?
5. Mr. Burger for Plaintiff (CATO): Your Honor, as Mr. Mason concedes, in the current problem, defendant's
     product was identical to plaintiff's [F18] and plaintiff was the only manufacturer making the product [F15].
     Boeing, which was won by plaintiff, does not have these strengths on plaintiff's part but is otherwise similar to the
     problem at hand. Where these additional strengths are present, a decision in favor of plaintiff is warranted even
     more strongly than it was in Boeing.

7. STUDENT: Help! (Continue)>
8. Della Street (whispering into Perry’s ear): Here is a hint. Even though factors F18 and F15 are differences,
     defendant cannot use them to distinguish Boeing. Defendant needs to focus on other differences, namely, on those
     differences that make the Lynchburg Lemonade case look stronger for defendant than Boeing.
9. <STUDENT (selecting from menu): Distinguish Boeing [F4][F12] [F14] [F16] (Continue)>
     Mr. Mason for Defendant (Student): Boeing is distinguishable, because in Boeing, defendant used materials that
     were subject to confidentiality restrictions [F14], plaintiff's disclosures to outsiders were subject to confidentiality
     restrictions [F12], and defendant entered into a nondisclosure agreement with plaintiff [F4]. This was not so in the
     Lynchburg Lemonade case. Also, in the Lynchburg Lemonade case, plaintiff's product information could be
     learned by reverse-engineering [F16]. This was not so in Boeing.
10. Judge (to Plaintiff’s counsel): Mr. Burger?
11. Mr. Burger for Plaintiff (CATO): Uhh. Well, as you know, Your Honor, Boeing, is not the only case we cite in
     our brief.
