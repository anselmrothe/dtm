aware of the rule and the instruction to use it, their per-

about the robustness and generality of their findings.
   Crucially, the explicit rule used in the experiment de-
fined a prototype. The use of similarity might conceivably
be an (artefactual) result of this, rather than a property of
rule application in general. Specifically, the rule used in
the Allen & Brooks study had the form "if X has 3 of the 5
