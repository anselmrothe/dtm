Results and Discussion
We first analyzed similarities participants reported prior
to solving the problems. Most participants reported
superficial similarities, such as that both problems
involved engineers. A few also reported highly abstract
similarities, such as that both problems involved an
obstacle that prevented a device from working. More
interestingly, some participants reported that both              Figure 2 A solution to the pole problem that is
