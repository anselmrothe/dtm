Abstract
Three- to four-month-old infants presented with a series
of cat or dog photographs show an unusual asymmetry in
the exclusivity of the perceptual category representations
formed. We have previously accounted for this
asymmetry in terms of an inclusion asymmetry in the
distribution of features present in the cat and dog images
used during familiarization (Mareschal, French, &
Quinn, 2000). We use a combination of connectionist
modeling and experimental testing of infants to show
that the asymmetry can be reversed by an appropriate
pre-selection and minor image modification of cat and
dog exemplars used for familiarization. The reversal of
the asymmetry adds weight to the feature distribution
explanation put forward by Mareschal et al. (2000).

Introduction
The ability to categorize is, without question, one of the
central pillars of cognition. It is, therefore, not
surprising that categorization abilities are present in
humans from the very earliest age. Indeed, infants only
a few months old are able to separate complex visual
stimuli into generic object categories (e.g., Quinn &
Eimas, 1996). In previous work, we have presented a
simple connectionist model of perceptual categorization
during early infancy (Mareschal & French, 1997;
Mareschal & French, 2000; Mareschal et al., 2000). The
model provided a mechanistic account of early infant
category learning in terms of the data compression
properties of connectionist autoencoder networks. Not
only did this model capture standard infant
categorization phenomena such as prototype formation
and the use of feature co-variation information to form
categories (Mareschal & French, 2000), but it also
captured some of the more subtle idiosyncratic
characteristics of infants’ categorization behavior.
In particular, 3- to 4-month-olds show an unexpected
asymmetry in the exclusivity of the perceptual category
representations formed for cats versus dogs (Quinn,
Eimas, & Rosenkrantz, 1993; Eimas, Quinn, & Cowan,
1994). Following exposure to a series of cat
photographs, these infants will form a perceptual

representation for cats that excludes dogs. In contrast,
following exposure to a series of dog photographs, the
same infants will form a category representation for
dogs that does NOT exclude cats. Thus, there is an
asymmetry in the exclusivity of the cat and dog
categories: dogs are excluded from the representation
for cats, whereas dog do not exclude cats.
We extend these results by showing how an opposite
exclusivity asymmetry can be induced in 3- to 4-montholds by a judicious choice of cat and dog exemplars
presented to the infants prior to testing. Success in
reversing the asymmetry between the Cat and Dog
categories would lend strong support to a bottom-up
account of early infant perceptual categorization.

Asymmetric exclusivity in infant
categorization
Quinn et al. (1993) reported the following surprising
categorization asymmetry. When 3- to 4-month-old
infants were shown different photographs of either cats
or dogs, they formed perceptual category
representations for either groups of pictures. Infants
were first shown a number of different photographs of
cats and were then shown a picture of a dog paired with
a novel picture of a cat. During the preference trials, the
infants were much more attentive to the dog than to the
novel cat. This was interpreted as showing that the
infants had formed a category representation of Cat that
excludes dogs. The dog, in other words, was perceived
by the infants as not belonging to the category of cats.
In sharp contrast, infants who were first shown a series
of photographs of different dogs and were then shown a
picture of a cat along with a novel dog were not
preferentially attentive to either picture. When coupled
with the finding that infants did not show a prior
preference for cat photographs over dog photographs,
and that infants familiarized with either cats or dogs
looked longer at a bird photograph, the overall pattern
of results was interpreted as showing that infants had
formed a category representation of Dog that did not
exclude cats. In short, the Dog category included cats,
but the Cat category did not include dogs.

A model of infant perceptual categorization
We used a three-layer autoencoder to model infant
categorization behaviors (Mareschal & French, 1997;
Mareschal & French, 2000; Mareschal et al., 2000).
Learning in an autoencoder consists of developing an
internal representation of the input (at the hidden unit
level) that is sufficiently reliable to reproduce all the
information in the original input (Cottrell, Munro, &
Zipser, 1988). Information is first compressed into an
internal representation and then expanded to reproduce
the original input. The successive cycles of training in
the autoencoder are an iterative process by which a
reliable internal representation of the input is
developed. The reliability of the internal representation
is tested by expanding it and comparing the resulting
predictions to the actual stimulus being encoded.
The degree to which network error increases on
presentation of a novel object depends on the similarity

between the novel object and previously seen (i.e.,
familiar) objects. Presenting a series of similar objects
leads to a progressive drop in error on future similar
objects. The modeling assumption that we have
therefore made is that network error and infant attention
levels correlate: the higher the network error, the longer
the looking time of the infant This is true of both
autoassociators (where output error is the measurable
quantity) and infants (where looking time is the
measurable quantity).
To model the Cat/Dog findings, we obtained data for
the networks from measurements of the original cat and
dog pictures used by Quinn et al. (1993). There were 18
dogs and 18 cats classified according to the following ten
traits: head length, head width, eye separation, ear
separation, ear length, nose length, nose width, leg
length vertical extent, and horizontal extent. The feature
values were normalized over all pictures in both training
sets to be within 0 and 1.

Attention

Infant perceptual categorization tasks frequently rely
on preferential looking techniques based on the finding
that infants direct attention more to unfamiliar or
unexpected stimuli (e.g., Sokolov, 1963; Charlesworth,
1969; Cohen, 1973). While it is true that infants may
sometimes have a preference for familiar stimuli, such
as word stress patterns (Jusczyk, Cutler, & Redanz,
1993), it has been repeatedly shown that there is
preferential attention directed to novel visual stimuli.
The standard interpretation of this behavior is that the
infants are comparing the input stimuli to an internal
representation of those stimuli. As long as there is a
discrepancy between the information stored in the
internal representation and the visual input the infant
continues to attend to the stimuli. While attending to the
stimuli the infant updates its internal representation.
When the information in the internal representation is
no longer discrepant with the visual input, attention is
switched elsewhere. When a familiar object is presented
there is little or no attending because the infant already
has a reliable internal representation of that object. In
contrast, when an unfamiliar or unexpected object is
presented, there is a lot of attending because an internal
representation has to be constructed or adjusted.
When a series of exemplars can be grouped into a
consistent category, this account of representation
construction implies a progressive decrease in looking
time with successive exemplars encountered. Although
each exemplar encountered is novel (and therefore
attracts the infant’s attention), the process of
representation construction gradually leads to the
extraction of key dimensions of the category. Thus,
after some time, a reliable category representation is
constructed and new exemplars encountered (although
still novel), take little time to be assimilated to the
internal category representation and therefore only
briefly capture the infant’s attention.

Figure 1. Generalization errors for networks
trained on cats and dogs (Mareschal et al. 2000).
Figure 1 shows what happens when networks trained
on cats are presented with a novel cat and a dog, and
when networks trained on dogs are tested with a novel
dog and a cat. When the networks are initially trained
(i.e., familiarized) on cats, the presentation of a dog
results in a large error score (corresponding to infants’
longer looking time). Dogs are not included in the
category representation of cats. In contrast, when the
networks are initially trained on dogs, the presentation
of a cat will result in essentially the same error as a
novel dog, suggesting that the cats have been included
in the category representation for dogs.
Because auotencoders extract the distribution
statistics of the exemplars they have encountered, this
led us to explore the distribution of feature values in the
data measured from the original photographs in order to
explain the asymmetry. Figure 2 shows the probability
distributions of the 10 traits for both cats and dogs.
Some of the traits are very similar in terms of their
means and distribution of both cats and dogs (e.g., head
length and head width). Others, especially nose length
and nose width, are very different and will provide the
crucial explanation of the unexpected attentional
asymmetries reported by Quinn et al. (1993) and Eimas

for those traits for the Dog category. Fully half of the
cats in the population could be reasonably classified as
dogs. In contrast, the smaller means and lower
variances of a number of traits (especially, nose length
and nose width) for cats compared to dogs means that
only 2 of the 18 dogs could conceivably be classified as
being members of the Cat category.
Hence, it seems that the exclusivity asymmetry is
driven by (1) an associative learning mechanism that is
sensitive to feature distributions, and (2) a distribution

et al. (1994). It is clear that in almost all cases the
distribution for each Dog trait (represented by the dark
line) subsumes the distribution for corresponding trait
for cats. The narrower distributions for most Cat traits,
on the other hand, do not subsume the range of values
for the corresponding Dog traits. In other words, cats
are possible dogs but the reverse is not the case: most
dogs are not possible cats. Specifically, when we
examine all of the members of the two populations, we
see that the values of all ten traits for 9 (i.e., 50%) of
the members of the Cat category fall within a 2σ cut-off

profile in which the Dog feature values largely subsume
the Cat feature values. A direct implication of this is
that if the distribution statistics were reversed, then we
should observe a reversed categorization asymmetry. In
this new case, infants should develop a perceptual
category representation of Dog that excludes cats and a
perceptual category representation of Cat that does not
exclude dogs. The simulation and experiments reported
below test this prediction directly.

Reversing asymmetric exclusivity
To explore whether the asymmetry could be
experimentally reversed, we began by artificially
manipulating the naturally occurring variance of the
two categories. In the original experiment the withincategory variability of the dog photographs was greater
than that of the cat photographs and, crucially, the
feature set for dogs largely subsumed that of cats.
However, by carefully selecting sets of cat and dog
photographs and then morphing a number of these
images, we were able to reverse the variance of the
categories In the original experiment (Mareschal et al.,
2000) the average variance over all ten features of the
Dogs was 1.63 times that of the Cats, whereas for the
modified images the average variance of Cats was 3.12
times that of Dogs. Figure 3 shows the feature
distributions for these modified exemplar sets. A
comparison with the original data plotted in Fig. 2
shows how the distributions have been reversed. This is

especially clear for features such as “Leg length.”
There were an identical number of morphed images (8
out of 18) in both the Dog and Cat stimuli sets.

Reversing the network’s learning
The simulation reported was done on a standard 10-810 feedforward backpropagation autoencoder network
(learning rate: 0.1, momentum: 0.9, Fahlman offset:
0.1). Training was identical to that in Mareschal et. al.
(2000). Networks were trained in batches of 2 patterns
for a maximum of 250 epochs. This simulated
familiarization with pairs of pictures for a fixed period
before being presented with a new familiarization pair.
Results were averaged over 50 runs.
Figure 4 shows the model’s generalization error to
novel exemplars of cats and dogs as a function of
whether they were trained on cats or on dogs. Networks
trained with cats show no difference in error (hence
predict no difference in looking times) when tested with
a novel cat or a dog. In contrast, the networks
originally trained with dogs show much greater error
when tested with a novel cat than when tested with a
novel dog (suggesting a strong preference for looking at
a cat vs. a novel dog). This asymmetry is exactly the
opposite of the one found in the original Mareschal et
al. (2000) study and constitutes an explicit prediction of
the autoencoder model.

reversed and, crucially, Dog features are largely subsumed by Cat features. Compare with Figure 2
.

Experiment 1: Reversal of exclusivity
This prediction was tested with two groups of 3- and 4month-old infants that were presented with a set of 12
exemplars from the same category, cats or dogs, during
a series of familiarization trials, and were then
presented with preference test trials consisting of a
novel cat paired with a novel dog. The model predicts
that infants familiarized with dogs should display a
novel category preference for cats on the preference test
trials, whereas infants familiarized with cats should
display looking times divided evenly between the dogs
and cats displayed on the preference test trials.

Method
Participants. The participants in Exp. 1 were 12
infants approximating 3 and 4 months of age (M = 3
months, 20 days; SD = 8.30 days). Seven of the infants
were females and five were males.
Stimuli. The stimuli were 36 colored photographs of
cats and dogs (18 exemplars per category, representing
18 different breeds for each category). The photographs
were obtained from Siegal (1983) and Schuler (1980).
In order to obtain dogs with low perceptual variance
and cats with high variance, certain stimuli were
slightly modified using computer imaging processing
software (Rubber v.2.0). None of the stimuli were
“morphed” to the point of giving the impression of a
strange animal. The same number of animals (8) were
morphed in both groups. The variance of the Cat
category was modified so that the average variance of
Cats was 3.1 times that of Dogs (compared to the
original experiment where the average variance of Dogs
was 1.6 times that of Cats). As in Quinn et al. (1993)
and Mareschal et al. (2000), the pictures selected were
chosen to represent a variety of shapes, colors, and
orientations of each type of animal. The size of the
animal in each picture was nearly the same, and thus
not a reflection of its actual size (so that any
categorization effects observed would not be the result
of simple size discrimination.)
Each stimulus contained a single animal, cut away

from its background, centered, and mounted onto a
white 17.7 x 17.7 cm posterboard for presentation.
Apparatus. Infants were tested in a visual preference
apparatus, modeled on the one described by Fagan
(1970). The apparatus is a large, three-sided gray
viewing chamber that is on wheels. It has a hinged, gray
display panel (85 cm high and 29 cm wide) onto which
were attached two compartments to hold the
posterboard stimuli. The stimuli were illuminated by a
60-Hz fluorescent lamp that was shielded from the
infant's view. The center-to-center distance between
compartments was 30.5 cm and on all trials the display
panel was situated approximately 30.5 cm in front of
the infant's face. There was a 0.625 cm peephole
midway between the two display compartments
allowing observation of the infant's visual fixations.
Procedure. In both experiments, infants were placed
in a reclining position on their seated parent's lap. An
experimenter positioned the apparatus such that the
midline of the infant's head was aligned with the
midline of the display panel. The experimenter loaded
the appropriate stimuli into the display panel, elicited
the infant's attention and exposed the stimuli to the
infant. During the course of a trial, the experimenter
observed the infant through the peephole and recorded
visual fixations to the left and right stimuli by means of
two 605 XE Accusplit electronic stop watches, one of
which was held in each hand. Interobserver reliability
for this procedure was determined by comparing the
looking times measured by the experimenter using the
center peephole and additional observers using
peepholes to the left of the left stimulus compartment
and to the right of the right stimulus compartment is
high (Pearson r = .97), a value comparable to values
obtained in other laboratories that measured visual
fixation duration with the corneal reflection procedure
(e.g., O'Neil, Jacobson, & Jacobson, 1994). Two
experimenters recorded fixations, one during
familiarization and another during preference test trials.
Importantly, the person recording during preference test
trials was unaware of the category information that was
presented during the familiarization trials.
Each infant was assigned twelve randomly selected

pictures of cats or dogs. On each of six 15s
familiarization trials, two of the twelve stimuli, again
randomly selected, were presented. Six infants were
randomly assigned to each group, defined by the
familiarization category, cats or dogs. Immediately after
the familiarization trials, two 10s preference test trials
were administered in which a novel cat was presented
with a novel dog. There were six such pairs, randomly
selected, and each pair, which was seen on both test
trials, was assigned to one infant who had seen dogs
and one infant who had seen cats during the
familiarization trials. The test-trial stimuli were thus
identical for both groups of infants. The left-right
positioning of the novel animal from the novel category
was appropriately counterbalanced across infants.

that the stimulus manipulations were successful in
reversing the inclusion relation between dogs and cats
reported by Mareschal et al. (2000).

performed on the individual scores, revealed no
significant effects, F(1, 10) < 2.28, p > .15, in each
instance. As has been the case in previous infant
categorization studies using the same procedures and
similar stimuli (Eimas & Quinn, 1994; Eimas, et al.
1994; Mareschal et al., 2000; Quinn & Eimas, 1996,
1998; Quinn, et al., 1993), no evidence of
habituation was obtained. We believe the complexity
and variety of stimuli were sufficient to maintain infant
attention during the familiarization trials.

Experiment 2: No prior preference
An alternative explanation for the outcome of Exp. 1 is
that infants might have spontaneously preferred the cats
over the dogs. Although no such spontaneous
preference was found in Quinn et al. (1993) or Quinn
and Eimas (1996), it is possible that the stimulus
manipulations could have inadvertently produced one.
If there was a preference for cats over dogs in Exp. 1,
then it would have facilitated (if not fully explained)
any presumed novel category preference for cats after
familiarization with dogs, and it would have interfered
with any novel category preference for dogs after
familiarization with cats. Exp. 2 was thus replication of
Exp. 1, but conducted without the familiarization trials.

Procedure. All infants were presented with the

Results and Discussion
A preference score for cats was determined for each
infant for the two trials by dividing the looking time
that the cat was observed by the total looking time to
both the cat and dog. The score was then converted into
a percentage. The mean preference for cats was
48.34%, SD =22.03. This preference was not
significantly different from chance, t(5) = -0.18, p >
.20, two-tailed. Further, the preference for cats after
familiarization with dogs in Exp. 1 was found to be
reliably higher than the spontaneous preference for cats
with no familiarization with dogs, t(10) = 2.24, p < .05,
two-tailed. The preference results from Exp. 1 are thus
unlikely to be reflective of a spontaneous preference for
cats and more likely are a consequence of the reversal
of the inclusion relation between cats and dogs.

Conclusion
Quinn, Eimas, & Rosenkrantz (1993) observed a
striking asymmetry in the infant categorization of
photos of cats and dogs. An initial simulation by
Mareschal and French (1997) and Mareschal et al.
(2000) was able to reproduce the original experimental
results by focusing on the within-category variability
and inclusion relation of the two categories of animals.
This simulation led to a prediction — namely, that if
the degree of variability and overlap of shared feature
distributions was the key to explaining this
categorization asymmetry, then artificially reversing the
order of the within-category variability for shared
features should reverse the infant categorization
asymmetry. We were able to reverse this categorical
variability and, as predicted by the model, we observed
the reverse categorization asymmetry in the infants.
The reversal of the asymmetry makes the point that
infants form at least some category representations online, rather than tapping into pre-existing concepts that
had been formed prior to arriving at the laboratory. If
the infants been relying on previously acquired
categories, then their responsiveness should not have
varied with the variations in the familiar category
information presented. The fact that infant
responsiveness did vary across experiments suggests
that the categories were being formed on-line and that
the boundaries can be pushed around depending on the
information presented during familiarization.
