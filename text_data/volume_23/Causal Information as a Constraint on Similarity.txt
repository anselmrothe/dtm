Cheng, 2000; Murphy & Medin, 1985). The results
reported here extend this research to similarity
judgments among novel stimuli and provide a
paradigm to study this effect. A two-phase blocking
paradigm such as the one used by Waldmann and
Holyoak (1992) can be used to isolate the effects of
causal understanding from the effects of mere
association. We found that different causal schemas
applied to the same correlational data affected rated
similarity of novel stimuli. Of course, causality is not
the only mechanism that constrains similarity.
Analogical processes and higher-order relations are also
responsible for providing constraints (Medin,
Goldstone, & Gentner, 1993).
  Why should causal information be so important?
People need to discover causal relations because only
such relations allow the prediction of the consequences
of interventions. This constraint makes discovery of
causal features vital for understanding the world and for
predicting future events. Having a notion of similarity
that reflects the causal relations in the world is critical
for inductive inference.
