Method Overview
The language transcripts used for the training and test
data sets for a self-organising network were obtained
from the CAP Corpus [Bates, Fredrici and Wulfeck
(1987a and 1987b)]. The CAP Corpus is made up of
transcripts of English-speaking subjects that are divided
into three groups: Broca’s aphasia, Wernicke’s aphasia
and a control group of healthy people. The language
transcripts were produced using a variation of the “given-
new” picture description task of MacWhinney and Bates.
In this task subjects were shown nine sets of three pic-
tures and were asked to describe them (see Table 3).
The transcripts contained the subject’s response and the
morphemic coding. We used the coding from a pre-               Figure 1: A representation of the activity maps of a self-

eating a small yellow banana.” the first six words ob-
tained are “the monkey is sitting down eating” and two of
the training/test phrases are “the monkey is” and “mon-
key is sitting”. Since every word of these phrases is rep-
resented by a four digit binary number, the input layer
for the network architecture has twelve units. The bi-
nary representations for the word are Determiner (0110),
Noun (1100), Plural (0011), Pronoun (0111), Preposi-
tion (1001), Adjective (0101), Conjunction (1011), Verb
(0010), Progressive (1000), Auxiliary Verb (0100), Ad-
verb (0001) and Numeric (1010). Table 4 shows typical
