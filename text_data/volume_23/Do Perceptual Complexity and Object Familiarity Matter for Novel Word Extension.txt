simple-object conditions and shape in the two complex

  These results conflict with previous findings that
children extend novel adjectives to objects of the same
material only when the object kinds are familiar to the
child. One possibility for this discrepancy is that the
unfamiliar stimuli selected by Hall Waxman, and
Hurwitz (1993) may have been inadvertently more
complex than the familiar stimuli. Because Hall
Waxman, and Hurwitz sought to control for taxonomic
kind between the two conditions, the types of items that
were unfamiliar to children may have also been slightly
more complex than items that were familiar to children.
For example, in the familiar condition one set of stimuli
contained a cup and a spoon. In the unfamiliar
condition the analogous set contained a garlic press and
