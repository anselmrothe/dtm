A bstract
W e investigated the categories ofneuralplasticity and
the genesisofthe neuralrepresentation forlanguage in
population of 43 pediatric hem ispherectom ies. W e
have chosen to correlate language outcom es w ith the
stages of neuronal plasticity rather than age at insult
because of the unavoidable confound betw een the
latter and etiology (Curtiss and de Bode, subm itted).
W e argue that by exam ining the neural substrate for
language
and
language
outcom es
posthem ispherectom y, it is possible a) to investigate the
progression of neural representation from
pluripotential and distributed to localized and
specialized and b) to accurately predict language
outcom es.

Introduction and R ationale
Itisstillunclearw hetherneuralsystem sunderlying
adultorganization forlanguage crucially differfrom
theirrespective counterparts in the young brain.
Though the assum ption ofcom plete and rapid
recovery ofchildren afterbrain lesions has been
abandoned by the m ajority ofresearchers,there is no
question thatthe rate and extentofreorganization in
children differfrom adults recovering from sim ilar
insults. The tw o m ostobvious hypotheses explaining
thisphenom enon m ake tw o differentsetsof
assum ptions. First,itis possible thatlanguage
representation in a young brain isnotidenticalto its
adultcounterpart. Indeed,m ore diffuse brain
organization ofthe im m ature brain is suggested both
by recentbrain im aging studiesand language
acquisition research in clinicaland norm al
populations ((D apretto,W oods,& Bookheim er,
2000;M ills,Coffey-Corina,& N eville,1993;
Papanicolaou,D iScenna,G illespie,& A ram ,1990).
U nderthishypothesisfasterrecovery ratesin
children m ay be explained by the factthatfunctional
localization and corticalcom m itm enthave notyet
reached theirpeak,i.e.theiradultpattern. A n
alternative explanation does notneed to assum e brain
organization thatisdifferentfrom adults.Em pirical

supportforthis hypothesis is provided by
investigationsofchildhood acquired aphasia. This
research indicatesthe presence ofadult-like neural
representation forlanguage and sim ilar
consequencies ofbrain dam age in children and adults
(Paquier& V an D ongen,1998).Thusitispossible
thatm ore efficientreorganization isachieved due to
neuralplasticity ofa young brain,in otherw ords,
w ith the help ofthe sam e m echanism sthatare
already in place guiding and supporting brain
m aturation in the firstdecade oflife.
The tw o accounts need notbe m utually exclusive.
Itis possible thatw hatseem s like w iderfunctional
distribution is,in fact,the reflection ofboth
exuberantneuronalconnectivity and increased
neuronalexcitation characteristic ofan im m ature
brain. This suggestion is supported by the findings of
som e recentbrain im aging studies. D apretto etal.
(2000)dem onstrated thatboth phonologicaland
sem antic conditionsactivated sim ilarthough not
com pletely identicalareas in adults and children.
Furtherm ore,corticalareas activated only by specific
linguistic tasks in adults show ed reliable activation
during alltasksin children. The authorsinterpret
these findings in term s ofincreased functional
specialization w ith developm entand redundancy in
the neuralsystem subserving language early in
developm ent. Taking these conclusionsone step
further,w e suggestthatthe dichotom y of
‘pluropotentialand distributed’versus‘
specialized
and localized’exists only on the functionallevel.
O n the neurobiologicallevel,language representation
in children issim ilarto adults,butthissim ilarity is
m asked by diffuse connectivity and exuberant
synaptic proliferation thatcharacterize the young
brain.
Forthe purpose ofthispaperw e assum e thatan
innate endow m entand corticalrepresentation for
language are presentfrom birth. W e also assum e that
quantitative differencesofan im m ature cortex lead to
som e qualitative differences(such as pluripotential

M ethods
Subjects consisted of43 patients w ho underw ent
hem ispherectom y forintractable seizures atthe
U CLA M edicalCenter. Etiology w as catalogued
according to the follow ing breakdow n:
developm entalpathology -28 subjects
(hem im egalencephaly -H M ,cortical
dysplasia/m ultilobarinvolvem ent-M L,and prenatal
infarct);acquired pathology -15 subjects
(Rasm ussen’
s encephalitis -RE and postnatal
infarct). Postoperative spoken language outcom e
w as rated based on spontaneous speech sam ples from
0 = no language to 6 = fluentm ature gram m ar.
Language scores w ere defined on the basis ofstages
in norm allanguage developm ent. The com plete
inform ation regarding the breakdow n ofour
population isshow n in Table 3.

D iscussion
Based on the anim alstudiesw e suggestthatthe
CriticalM aturation Period in hum ansislim ited by
the follow ing thresholds:the low erthreshold thatis
characterized by the com pletion of
neuro/m orthogenesisand establishm entofexperience
independentconnectivity;and the upperthreshold of
the com pletion ofthe period ofneuronal/synaptic
adjustm ent. N ext,follow ing G reenough etal.(1999)
w e assum e thatthe follow ing com ponents underlie

functionaland neurologicalm aturation oflanguage:
(1)developm entalprocessesthatare insensitive to
experience,i.e.the genetic envelope of
predeterm ined plasticity;(2)an experience-expectant
period ofneuronalplasticity also know n as the
CriticalM aturation Period;and (3)an experiencedependentperiod ofneuronalplasticity w hich
underlies the ability to encode new experiences
throughoutthe lifespan (Table 2). W e thus
hypothesized thatsuperim posing effects ofspecific
etiologies on these developm entalstages w ould allow
form ore accurate prediction oflanguage outcom es
follow ing hem ispherectom y,since in ourm odel
functionalreorganization reflectsunderlying
neurobiologicalreorganization.
O urresultsconfirm ed ourhypothesisin that
postoperative language outcom es correlated w ith
etiology. This w ould be expected since as show n in
Table 2 differentetiologies resultin different
potentialforrecovery (due to tim ing and extent).
D evelopm entalplasticity,i.e.reinnervation and
neuronalsparing,seem to be m ore efficientin
etiologiesw ith lateronset. In addition,w hen
pathology disrupts genetically determ ined processes
(as in hem im egalencephaly and corticaldysplasia)
functionaldevelopm entseem s to be particularly
com prom ised. Thusthe bestlanguage scoresw ere
found in Rasm ussen’
sencephalitisand the poorestin
hem im egalencephaly. M oreover,etiology

(developm entaloracquired)consistently em erged as
a significantvariable distinguishing linguistic
outcom es in allstatisticalanalyses. In allcases itw as
possible to predictpostsurgery language outcom es by
considering the effectofspecific etiologies w ithin the
fram ew ork ofthe categories ofneuralplasticity. It
should be noted thatw e have deliberately chosen to
relate functionaloutcom es and the broad
categories/stages ofneuronalplasticity instead of
providing directcorrelationsw ith age atinsult. Itis
ourbeliefthatin such correlations the confound
betw een etiology and age atinsultisunavoidable
(Curtiss,de Bode and M athern,subm itted).
The rate and quality ofneuronalreorganization
reflected in language outcom e also confirm ed the left
hem isphere’
spredisposition to supportlanguage,
since children w ith an isolated righthem isphere had

significantly m ore problem sacquiring/restoring their
language. Im portantly,how ever,though age at
surgery fortw o ofourRE children w as as old as 12,
neitherofthem hasrem ained m ute afterleft
hem ispherectom y,suggesting thatlanguage
specialization had notyetreached itspeak,and
reorganization w as stillpossible. O urprelim inary
research also indicates thateven in the m ostseverely
com prom ised cases,language developm entfollow s
the norm alcourse oflanguage acquisition albeiton a
prolonged scale. These findings lead us to suggest
thatinnate language universalsare resilientto brain
dam age,although language representation in the
brain does notseem s to be anatom ically-bound to the
lefthem isphere only.
