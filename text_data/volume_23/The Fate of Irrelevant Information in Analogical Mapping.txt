placed in correspondence by virtue of playing a
common role in a matching relational structure.
Alignable differences can be contrasted to nonalignable
differences, which are objects that do not participate in
the common relational structure. Alignable differences
are more focal to comparisons than are nonalignable
differences.
  In this paper we are interested in a second type of
irrelevant information that has not received much
attention in the analogy literature. In particular, when
an alignable difference is found, some of the attributes
of the corresponding objects are likely to be irrelevant
to the relational match. For example, in Figure 1, the
pig in the top scene and the baby in the bottom scene
are an alignable difference, because each is making a
mess. Attribute information about the pig such as its
snout and ears are not relevant to the relational match.
Is information like this treated as focal to the
comparison because it is part of an alignable difference,
or is it treated like a nonalignable difference because it
is irrelevant to the relational correspondence?
