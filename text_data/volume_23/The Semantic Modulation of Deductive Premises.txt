Abstract
Two experiments examined how the mental models of
premises influence deductive reasoning. Experiment 1
showed that individuals draw different conclusions from
the same information depending on whether it is
expressed in conditional assertions or disjunctions. It
also showed that co-reference within the premises can
speed up more difficult inferences. Experiment 2
corroborated these results and also showed that the
failure to represent what is false can lead people to draw
illusory inferences, i.e., systematic but compelling
fallacies.

Introduction
The ability to reason deductively is central to human
intelligence. Our goal is to examine how the nature of
mental representations can influence this ability.
Several factors should influence the process. First, the
verbal formulation of premises should lead to different
representations of the same underlying information. In
turn, these representations should lead reasoners to
draw different conclusions.
Second, the semantic
content of premises should influence the process of
deductive reasoning.
It should eliminate certain
possibilities, and, in the case of co-reference from one
clause to another, it may yield more concise
representations. In this paper, we examine how these
different factors impact on deductive reasoning.

Mental Models and Deductive Reasoning
The theory of mental models postulates that individuals
who have no training in logic represent the meaning of
assertions in mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne,
1991). Each mental model represents a possibility.
But, the limitations of working memory force
individuals to abide by the principle of truth: mental
models represent only true possibilities and within them
the constituent propositions in premises only when they
are true. For example, an exclusive disjunction such
as:
Either Mary is in Brussels or Gino is in Rome, but

not both.
elicits two mental models of the alternative
possibilities:
Mary-Brussels
Gino-Rome
where "Mary-Brussels" denotes a model of Mary in
Brussels, and "Gino-Rome" denotes a model of Gino in
Rome. Mental models of possibilities do not represent
the falsity of the clauses in the disjunction, e.g., that
Gino is not in Rome in the first possibility. One
consequence is that mental models should give rise to
illusory inferences, i.e., fallacies that most individuals
make.
Recent studies have corroborated their
occurrence (e.g. Johnson-Laird and Savary, 1999). In
one experiment, participants were given the following
problem:
If there is a king in the hand then there is an ace in
the hand, or else if there is not a king in the hand
then there is an ace in the hand.
There is an king in the hand.
What follows?
All the participants drew the conclusion that there is an
ace in the hand. Mental models yield this conclusion,
but it is wrong. In fact, the sentential connective or
else implies that one of the conditionals could be false.
But, if the first conditional is false, then there isn't an
ace in the hand even though there is a king in the hand.
The meanings of clauses, their co-referential
relations, and background knowledge, can all modulate
the basic meanings of sentential connectives (JohnsonLaird and Byrne, 2001). One way modulation can
occur is when background knowledge prevents the
construction of a model. Consider, for example, the
conditional:
If she played a game, then she didn’t play soccer.
The basic interpretation of a conditional allows the
possibility that she doesn’t play a game but that she
plays soccer. This possibility, however, is eliminated
by the knowledge that soccer is a game.
A second example of modulation, in our view, is
Bouquet and Warglien's (1999) discovery that

reasoning from disjunctions was more accurate when
the clauses were co-referential, e.g.:
Either Gino is in Brussels or Gino is in Rome, but not
both. Gino is not in Rome. What follows?
Premises of this sort yielded a greater proportion of
valid conclusions, e.g.: Gino is in Brussels, than
premises that did not refer to the same individual in
both clauses.
Co-reference may enable people to
construct representations that are more concise. The
aim of Experiment 1 was to examine this possibility.

Experiment 1: Co-reference in reasoning
Our conjecture is that co-reference may allow reasoners
to build a more concise representation of the premises,
thereby reducing the load on working memory. We
predicted that such representations should facilitate
performance in reasoning tasks particularly if the
demands on working memory are high. In addition,
the form of the premises - whether they are based on a
disjunction or a conditional - should make different
information available. Hence, each sort of premise
should make some inferences easier and some more
difficult to draw.
Each participant carried out 32 inferences in a
different random order. The inferences concerned
people carrying out various actions.
For half the
inferences, the first premise was an exclusive
disjunction, e.g.:
Rachel is climbing up the stairs or David is cooking
at the stove but not both
which should elicit the mental models:
Rachel-climbing
David-cooking
For half the inferences, the same information was
expressed as a biconditional, e.g.:
If and only if Rachel is not climbing up the stairs then
David is cooking at the stove.
which should elicit the mental models:
¬ Rachel-climbing
David-cooking
. . .
where "¬" denotes negation, and the ellipsis denotes an
implicit model, which acts as a "place holder" for the
possibilities in which the antecedent is false. If
necessary, it can be fleshed out explicitly.
The second premise was a categorical assertion or
categorical denial of either the first or second
proposition in the preceding premise. There were
accordingly 8 forms of inference.
In order to manipulate co-reference, there were four
types of semantic content:
1 . Two persons do two different actions (twoactions).

2. Two persons do one action, which they cannot
perform simultaneously (exclusive-action, e.g.
"sit on the stool").
3 . Two persons do one action, which they can
perform simultaneously (inclusive-action, e.g.,
"sit on the sofa").
4 . One person does two different actions, which
cannot be performed simultaneously (oneperson).
The eight forms of inferences with the four sorts of
content yielded the 32 different inferences.
The problems were presented on a computer. The
participants drew their own conclusion about what
followed from the premises. They responded by typing
their answer, and their latencies were measured from
the presentation of the premises to the first key press.
They were not told that their responses were being
timed. We tested 30 undergraduates from Princeton
University in return for course credit.

Results and Discussion
Table 1 presents the percentages of correct responses
to the eight forms of inference (collapsing over their
contents). As the Table shows, the participants were
more accurate when the categorical premise matched an
event that was represented explicitly in the models of
the first premise. When the categorical premise was
negative and concerned the first event in the preceding
premise, Not-A, the participants were more accurate in
reasoning from the biconditional (91%) than the
disjunction (68%). But, when the categorical premise
was affirmative, A, they were more accurate in
reasoning from the disjunction (94%) than from the
biconditional (78%; McNemar tests, chi-squared =
17.36 p < .0001; chi-squared = 15.04, p < .0001
respectively). Participants performed equally well on
both descriptions when the categorical premise affirmed
the second proposition, B, (94% for both, McNemar
Test, chi-squared = 0.07 p = 1). We predicted these
results in terms of mental models, but they might reflect
the surface matching of clauses in the premises. One
result, however, is more readily explained in terms of
models. When the categorical premise negated the
second proposition, not-B, participants were more
accurate in reasoning from the disjunction (68%) than
from the biconditional (46%; McNemar Test, chisquared = 13.8, p < .0002). Not-B mismatches the
clauses in both sorts of premises. It is also not
represented explicitly in the initial models of either
premise. But, reasoners may find it easier to flesh out
the disjunction, which already contains two mental
models, than to flesh out the conditional which is
represented by just one explicit mental model.

The co-referential manipulation had no effect on
accuracy. Yet, it did affect the latencies of correct
responses. The principal results were that responses to
exclusive-action problems (10.93 secs) and to inclusiveaction (10.18 secs) were faster than those to two-action
problems (11.58 secs; Wilcoxon test z = 2.33, 2.81, p <
.01, p < .003, respectively, excluding the results of two
outliers). In other words, co-reference can help the
process of reasoning. In particular, problems in which
two persons carry out one action, whether or not they
can perform it at the same time, elicited faster responses
than problems in which two persons carry out two
different actions. Reference to a common action may
yield more parsimonious models of the premises, and it
may help reasoners to avoid confusion about which
action a particular individual was carrying out. Such
confusions are more likely in the case of a disjunction,
which, unlike a biconditional, demands that reasoners
model two explicit possibilities. The shared referent in a
disjunction is common to two alternative models
whereas in a biconditional it occurs within one model.
That, perhaps, is why the referential effects were
stronger for disjunctions (exclusive-action 9.0 secs vs
two-action problems 10.7 secs, inclusive-action 8.7 secs
vs two-action problems 10.6 secs, Wilcoxon test z =
2.76, 2.44, p < .003, .01 respectively), than
biconditionals (exclusive-action 11.8 secs vs two-action
problems 12.3 secs, inclusive-action 11.7 secs vs twoaction problems 12.0 secs, Wilcoxon test z = 0.68, 1.47,
p < .25, .07 respectively). We followed up these
phenomena in a second experiment.

Experiment 2: Illusory inferences and coreference
The aims of the experiment were twofold. The first aim
was to examine what inferences people make from an
exclusive disjunction of the form:
Either P and Q or otherwise R and S.
The disjunction was paired with a categorical premise,
either asserting or denying its first proposition, P. The
participants had to evaluate the validity of a one-clause

conclusion, either Q or R. There were accordingly four
forms of inference.
The model theory predicts that the failure to make
certain information explicit in the models of the
disjunction should lead people to make invalid
inferences. According to the principle of truth,
reasoners should construct two mental models of such a
premise:
P
Q
R
S
It follows that given the categorical premise P,
reasoners should infer that Q and not-R follow.
Similarly, given the categorical premise not-P they
should infer that not-Q follows. These inferences,
however, are illusions. When falsity is taken into
account, the disjunctive premise is consistent with six
different possibilities, which we present here in fully
explicit models:
P
Q
¬R
S
P
Q
R
¬S
P
Q
¬R
¬S
¬P
Q
R
S
P
¬Q
R
S
¬P
¬Q
R
S
These models show that the three previous inferences
are invalid. Given the premise, P, for instance, Q and
not-Q are both possible, and likewise R and not-R are
both possible.
In contrast, given the categorical
premise, not-P, participants should correctly infer that R
follows: this conclusion follows from the mental
models above, but it also follows from the fully explicit
models.
Our second aim was to examine the effects of coreference on these inferences. Experiment 1 showed
that co-reference reduced response times, at least for
certain inferences. The present experiment followed up
this effect and the semantic modulation of the premises.
Table 2 presents the five sorts of semantic contents,
which manipulated the number of shared referents (i.e.,
people carrying out actions) contained in the first
premise, and whether the co-referential relations
occurred within or between models. We predicted that
co-reference would again facilitate performance and
that this facilitation would be greater as the number of
shared referents increased. We also predicted that
facilitation would be greater for problems requiring a
greater working memory load.
Table 2: The five sorts of semantic content in
Experiment 2, and the number of fully explicit models
compatible with each content.
1. Four persons act: six models

Either Jane is kneeling by the fire and Sean is
looking at the TV or otherwise Mark is standing at the
window and Pat is peering into the garden.
2. Two persons, one per clause: six models
Either Jane is kneeling by the fire and she is looking
at the TV or otherwise Mark is standing at the window
and he is peering into the garden.
3. Two persons do inclusive actions: six models
Either Jane is kneeling by the fire and Mark is
standing at the window or otherwise Jane is looking at
the TV and Mark is peering into the garden.
4. Two persons do exclusive actions: two models
Either Jane is kneeling by the fire and Mark is
looking at the TV or otherwise Jane is standing at the
window and Mark is peering into the garden.
5. One person: two models
Either Jane is kneeling by the fire and she is looking
at the TV or otherwise she is standing at the window
and she is peering into the garden.
_____________________________________________
The first three sorts of content in Table 2 are
consistent with all six of the fully explicit models
above. However, in the other two cases, the exclusive
actions rule out the models in which P and R occur
together, and Q and S occur together. The premise is
therefore consistent with just two fully explicit models:
P
Q
¬R
¬S
¬P
¬Q
R
S
These models yield the same conclusions as the mental
models described above, but these conclusions are no
longer illusions, but correct.
We tested individually 35 participants (25 paid
members of the public and 10 postgraduate volunteers
from the University of Dublin, Trinity College). They
acted as their own controls and carried out the 20
inferences in different random orders. We constructed
20 sets of materials, each of which contained the same
number of words. The materials were rotated so that
they were presented equally often with each of the five
sorts of semantic content.
The problems were presented on a computer screen.
For each problem, the premises and questions were
presented one-by-one on the screen. Participants
responded to the question by pressing one of three keys:
yes, no or cannot tell. The program recorded separately
the time that it took participants to read each of the
premises and to answer the question. The participants
were not told that their responses were being timed.

Results and Discussion
Table 3 presents the percentages of the "Yes" and "No"
responses to the main sorts of problems. As the table
shows, the participants succumbed to the illusory (six
model) problems (10% correct), but performed well the

(six-model) control problem (78% correct). Of the 35
participants, 34 were less accurate on the illusions than
on the control problems (Sign Test, p < 1 in 900
million). The pattern of responses was comparable for
the two model problems, and so we suspect that the
participants constructed just two models for the sixmodel and the two-model problems. A similar pattern
of results occurred in the participants' responses to the
first problem that they encountered. They were more
accurate with the two-model problems (81% correct)
than with the six-model problems (31% correct). This
result suggests that the illusions occurred spontaneously
and not as a result of the development of a mental set.

responses (around 10% per problem) were "can't tell".

There was no reliable difference between the five
semantic conditions in response accuracy or in the time
that it took to read the first premise. But, a significant
difference in response times occurred across conditions
when all responses were considered (Friedman Test,
chi-squared = 20.08, df = 1, p = .0005), and when we
included only the responses predicted by the mental
model theory (Friedman Test, chi-squared = 10.66, df =
1, p = .03). All further analyses are based only on the
responses predicted by the mental model theory,
because it is difficult to know what the participants
were doing when they got the answer right to the
illusory problems and wrong to the control problems.
There were two principal results:
1. Responses were faster when the first premise
referred to fewer individuals (1-person condition, mean
6.8 secs, 2-person conditions, mean = 8.6 secs, and 4person condition, mean = 8.3 secs; Kruskall Wallis
Test, chi-squared = 10.42, df = 2, p < .003).

2. The difference was significant in the differentmodel condition (1-person condition, mean 7.4 secs, 2person conditions, mean = 9.9 secs, and 4-person
condition, mean = 10.5 secs; Kruskall Wallis Test, chisquared = 12.2, df = 2, p < .002) but not in the samemodel condition (1-person condition, mean 6.3 secs, 2person conditions, mean = 7.4 secs, and 4-person
condition, mean = 6.6 secs; Kruskall Wallis Test, chisquared = 1.89, df = 2, p < .20).
The results corroborated the occurrence of illusory
inferences, and reasoners seem likely to construct just
two models of disjunctions of the form:
Either P and Q or otherwise R and S.
They overlook the different ways in which the
conjuncts could be false in the case of the six model
problems, i.e., those with a content that does not
eliminate any of the possibilities. The latencies of the
responses bear out our conjecture that inferences are
easier when the premises concern fewer individuals.
Reasoners can construct more concise models in this
case and are less open to confusion about who did what.
Faster responses occurred both when the co-referential
relation was within one model and when it was between
items in different models. However, response times
were faster only when reasoners had to consider an
alternative model to the one referred to in the
categorical premise, probably because that condition
places an extra load on working memory.

General Discussion
The mental model theory predicts that when people
represent a premise, they do so in accordance with the
principle of truth. They construct a representation that
makes only some information explicit. Experiment 1
corroborated the principle. It showed that reasoners
draw different conclusions from given information,
depending on whether it is expressed as a biconditional
or an exclusive disjunction. Likewise, Experiment 2
showed that the failure to represent falsity can lead
reasoners to make illusory inferences.
A second factor influences mental models: the
occurrence of co-reference within the premises.
Experiment 1 showed that co-reference within an
exclusive disjunction speeded up the process of
inference. Experiment 2 showed the same effect, but
only when reasoners had to consider an alternative
model to the one referred to in the categorical premise.
The inferential task in such cases places a bigger load
on working memory, and co-reference evidently
ameliorates matters. The same factor may explain why
there was no facilitation for conditionals in our first
experiment. Reasoners can construct a more concise
representation of premises containing co-referents.
This parsimony reduces the load on working memory
and the latencies of more difficult inferences.
