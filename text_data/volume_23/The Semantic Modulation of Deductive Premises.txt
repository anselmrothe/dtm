categorical premise, probably because that condition
places an extra load on working memory.
                  General Discussion
The mental model theory predicts that when people
represent a premise, they do so in accordance with the
principle of truth. They construct a representation that
makes only some information explicit. Experiment 1
corroborated the principle. It showed that reasoners
draw different conclusions from given information,
depending on whether it is expressed as a biconditional
or an exclusive disjunction. Likewise, Experiment 2
showed that the failure to represent falsity can lead
reasoners to make illusory inferences.
   A second factor influences mental models: the
occurrence of co-reference within the premises.
Experiment 1 showed that co-reference within an
exclusive disjunction speeded up the process of
inference. Experiment 2 showed the same effect, but
only when reasoners had to consider an alternative
model to the one referred to in the categorical premise.
The inferential task in such cases places a bigger load
on working memory, and co-reference evidently
ameliorates matters. The same factor may explain why
there was no facilitation for conditionals in our first
experiment. Reasoners can construct a more concise
representation of premises containing co-referents.
This parsimony reduces the load on working memory
and the latencies of more difficult inferences.
