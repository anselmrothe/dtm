of the constraint operating in this type of problem.
Instead, we propose that people are disposed to turn on
a dot, as opposed to turn on a point on the paper where
there is no dot (a non-dot point). This constraint
overlaps in meaning with the stay-within-the-figure

Nine-Dot Variants The three insight and three non-
insight versions of the nine-dot problem that were used
had been designed by MacGregor et al. (2001). The
insight problems required participants to turn on a non-
dot point (Figure 5), while the non-insight problems
were the insight problems with an added dot, which               Figure 5: Nine-Dot Variant: Insight Version
excused participants from having to turn on a non-dot
point (Figure 6). Each problem was presented on its
own page. The dots were filled circles that were 1 cm
in diameter. The center of each dot was approximately
3.75 cm apart.
