some cases, providing an entirely consistent label for the
stimuli during training causes participants to perform
worse. This is not what would be predicted from Homa &
Cultice (1984), and is at odds with the results from Estes
(1994) who showed that a condition analogous to the La-
bel condition in Experiment 1 gave better performance on
test than when participants were trained using a corrective
feedback approach. It may be that the real advantage lies
in being able to make active (i.e. self-generated) decisions
during training rather than simply being exposed to the
stimuli and the appropriate category information (Figure
4). Thus it may be the case that different processes are at
work

It seems likely that the most successful approach to mod-
