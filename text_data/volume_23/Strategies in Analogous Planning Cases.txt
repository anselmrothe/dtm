 Education strategy: Pop quiz. Ensure that students do their homework with the threat of a unannounced quiz
    Representation: The planner has the goal that an agent achieve a set of Knowledge goals and has a Plan with a
 Plan duration that includes the Agency of the agent to execute Subplans that are not Observed executions by the
 planner. The planner Envisions a threat to the plan in that the agent do not execute the Subplan with cause that it
 is not a Subplan of a goal of the agent, and the planner Envisions the possibility that the Successful execution of
 the plan would not achieve the goal. The planner Modifies the plan by Scheduling a set of Subplans at Start times
 that are Randomly selected from Moments in the Duration. In each subplan the planner Requests the execution of
 a plan by the agent such that the Successful execution of the plan Requires that the agent Executed the subplan in
 the goal that were Subplans previously scheduled, and where a Failed execution will cause a Violation of a goal
 of the agent. The planner adds a Planning constraint against plans that cause the agent to have Knowledge of the
 Scheduled start time of these subplans.
 Animal behavior strategy: Mark your territory. Leave scent marking to avoid unneccessary defensive conflicts
    Representation: The planner has a Competitive relationship with a set of agents, and has a Competitive plan that
 includes the Monitoring of execution of plans of the other agents for Locations of execution that are Locations in a
 Region, and In this case the execution of an Attack on the agent. A Threat exists that the execution of the Attack
 will be a Failed execution with a cause of a Successfully executed counterplan. The planner envisions that If it
 were the case that agents in the set had Knowledge of the Competitive plan of the planner, then a subset of the
 agents would add the Planning preference against plans that had a Location of execution in the Region. The
 planner executes a Repetitive plan to Encode information that is the Competitive plan of the planner and Transfer
 locations of the Encoding of information to a Location that is in the Region, where the Location is Selected from
 the set with a Selection criteria of Random choice.
 Counting strategy: Transfer between spaces. Count objects as they are moved into an empty location
    Representation: The planner has the Knowledge goal of the Quantity of Physical objects in a set. There exists a
 set of two Disjoint regions, where every object has a Location that is Contained within a region that is a member
 of the set. The planner has a Subplan to Transfer the location of a specific object that is Contained within a
 region of the set to a different Location that is Contained within the other region. The planner executes a plan to
 achieve the goal that all of the objects in the set have a Location that is Contained within the region that is the
 Start location in the Transfer of location subplan. The planner then Repetitively executes a subplan where the
 planner executes the Transfer of location subplan and Imagines a number. In the First repetition, the number is 1,
 and in Subsequent repetitions the number is the addition of 1 to the Imagined number in the Previous iteration.
 The Termination of repetition condition is that the planner has an Execution failure of the subplan with a cause of
 Unfound object in start location. The planner then Achieves the Knowledge goal that is the Imagined number in
 the Last repetition.
