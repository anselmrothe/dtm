Abstract
We use the literature on mechanical reasoning to derive
predictions about how people will test a mechanical rule.
In the presence of a single rule we predict significantly
more selections of tests in which the hypothesized cause
is manipulated than in the presence of two rules: the
original and one casting doubt on the sufficiency of the
hypothesized cause for the effect. We describe an
experiment using Wason's selection task that confirms
our predictions and go on to discuss the implications of
our results for recent work on causal cognition.

Introduction
Much of our everyday reasoning concerns the operation
of mechanical devices. Many of our interactions with
such devices, from figuring out how to program the
VCR to mastering the newest piece of software, require
us to draw inferences, make predictions and test
hypotheses. Some of this reasoning is very important
and, accordingly, mistakes can be costly. For example,
the Chernobyl explosion (see Medvedev, 1991) has
been used by Johnson-Laird (1993) to illustrate how
biased interpretation of evidence relevant to an
hypothesis about a device can lead to disaster.
Fortunately, not all faulty mechanical reasoning leads to
such calamitous consequences and sometimes we even
have the luxury of experimenting with a device in order
to see how it works. For example, the paradigmatic case
in the literature on discovery learning (Khlar & Dunbar,
1988) is how people acquire the ability to operate a
device by self-guided trial and error learning.
In this paper we will be concerned with the principles
that determine the tests that people choose to carry out
in order to examine an hypothesis about a mechanical
device. Consider, for example, a conditional hypothesis
concerning the cooling system in a factory:
(1) If the valve is open then water flows through the
pipe.
Our concern is how people will go about testing such a
rule rather than how they should test the rule. There are
four cases which seem intuitively relevant here: the
valve being open; the valve being closed; water flowing
through the pipe; and water not flowing through the

pipe. According to a normative theory based on the
hypothetico-deductive method (Popper, 1959), in order
to test the rule participants should chose to discover
information about what happens both when the valve is
open and when there is no water running through the
pipe. Only these tests can provide evidence that falsifies
the rule. Much research suggests that people do not
consider these to be the best tests with which to
examine a hypothesis and we do not think the case of
mechanical reasoning is likely to be any different in this
respect.
We suspect, however, that causal hypotheses
concerning a mechanical device - such as the one above
- will elicit a very specific pattern of testing behaviour
amongst participants. The detail of our suspicions and a
more comprehensive rationale will be presented in the
next section.

Mechanical Reasoning
There is a variety of work on mechanical reasoning in
the literature all of which suggests that people use
representations that are in some way analog to the
device being reasoned about. For example, Hegarty
(1992) has proposed an account of how people think
about devices claiming that mechanical reasoning
processes are isomorphic to the structure of the device
that is the subject of those processes. Hegarty's theory
was intended to explain results obtained using a
mechanical reasoning paradigm where participants are
shown static images of pulley systems and are asked to
predict the effect of some manipulation of the device.
For example, participants might be asked how one or
other of the pulleys in the image will move when a rope
is pulled. Hegarty's data, both from eye-movements and
gross reaction times, suggest that in making inferences
about a mechanical device, people animate contiguous
elements of the system piecemeal, by inferring a causal
chain of events from the input of the system to its
output.
Other work supports this conclusion. Schwartz &
Black (1996), in showing that people can induce rules
to describe a system based on mental depictions of that
system, provide evidence suggesting that the initial
depictions are constructed in a causal order. That is, in
the absence of a rule, people appear to mentally

simulate the effects of a manipulation to the system in
the direction of cause and effect.
People's piecemeal animation (Hegarty, 1992) and
depiction (Schwartz & Black, 1996) of mechanical
devices, suggest that their representations of mechanical
devices respect the causal structure of the device.
Furthermore, when people perform thought experiments
involving those representations, they perform them so
as to observe the effects on the system of the
manipulation of a causal agent.

There are, however, conditions under which we would
not expect participants to be primarily interested in tests
that respect the causal structure of the device. For
example, if the hypothesis is presented at the same time
as a second rule:

Testing Mechanical Hypotheses

where this second rule specifies an additional
antecedent for the consequent, then we would expect
participants to select fewer tests where the hypothesized
cause is manipulated. This is because the additional
antecedent introduces a potential disabling condition
(Cummins et al 1991) for the hypothesized cause. This
would mean that a failure to find the effect in the
presence or absence of the cause might be attributable
either to the hypothesized cause being insufficient to
produce the effect or to the absence of the enabling
condition. In the example above, the valve being open
and the pipe being free from blockages might be
conjointly necessary for water to flow through the pipe.
If this is the case then examining the results of tests
involving manipulation of the valve is unlikely to be
revealing of the truth or falsity of the rule in the absence
of information about the presence or absence of the
enabling condition.

We assume that in testing a causal hypothesis
concerning a mechanical device people will form a
representation of the hypothesized rule that respects its
causal direction. So, given hypothesis 1:
If the valve is open then water will flow through the
pipe
we expect participants to encode in their representation
the information that, under this hypothesis, the valve is
of causal significance with respect to water flowing
through the pipe.
Given previous work on how people animate and
perform mental experiments on models of devices, we
expect participants, when imagining the possible
consequences of performing a test on the system
described in the hypothesis, to represent the
consequences of the antecedent condition being in a
certain state. That is, we would expect participants to be
more interested in tests that respect the causal structure
of the hypothesis than in tests that require backwards
reasoning from changes in the effect to changes in its
putative cause. Specifically, we expect participants to
be more interested in cases where the cause is present
or absent than in cases where the effect is present or
absent.
The prediction that participants will be interested in
cases where the effect is absent is a risky one, as
participants are not normally interested in the false
antecedent case when testing a conditional rule. Indeed,
Oaksford and Chater's (1994) probabilistic account of
how people test conditional rules claims that the false
antecedent case is never informative. The situation for
causal conditional rules is very different, however,
where interest in the false antecedent case might be
interpreted as being due to the use of a counterfactual
strategy in testing the causal status of the antecedent.
Mackie (1974) claims that we infer causality not only
from repeated observations of contiguous events but
also from a consideration of what might be observed in
the absence of the putative cause. If the effect is also
absent under these circumstances then we infer a causal
relationship between the two. Harris, German & Mills
(1996) have demonstrated such a strategy in the causal
reasoning of children aged between 3 and 5 years.

(1) If the valve is open then water will flow through the
pipe
(2) If the pipe is free from blockages then water will
flow through the pipe

A Mechanical Selection Task
To test our intuitions about how causal rules about a
mechanical device are represented and hence tested, we
constructed a mechanical version of Wason's selection
task (Wason, 1968). In our version of the task
participants received a scenario (see below) which
supplied a context for a conditional rule describing a
causal relationship between the state of a component of
the device and some output. Underneath were printed
four cards representing the true antecedent, the false
antecedent, the true consequent and the false
consequent states of affairs. To test our hypotheses
concerning the conditions under which participants
would be primarily interested in tests of the hypothesis
that manipulated the putative cause, we constructed a
second version of the task. This second version was
achieved by adding a second rule to the problem
specifying an additional antecedent for the same
outcome (see 1 and 2 above).
Our manipulation of number of rules is directly
analogous to the presentation of additional antecedents
in the conditional arguments task (Byrne, 1989).
Participants who receive conditional reasoning
problems that specify an additional antecedent are
significantly less likely to draw the valid Modus Ponens
and Modus Tollens conclusions than are participants
who do not receive information about an additional

antecedent. This may be interpreted as the result of the
additional antecedent causing participants to doubt the
sufficiency of the first antecedent for the rule.
Byrne’s work was an extension of experiments
reported by Rumain, Connell & Braine (1983) who
showed that presenting participants with a second
conditional rule that specified an alternative antecedent
for the consequent suppressed the rate at which the
invalid Denial of the Antecedent and Affirmation of the
Consequent inferences were drawn. Recently, Feeney
and Handley (2000; Handley, Feeney & Harper, 2000)
have described the results of selection task experiments
where participants received a second rule specifying an
alternative antecedent for the consequent in the rule to
be tested. Across a series of six experiments large and
reliable rates of suppression of Q card selections were
found. A meta-analysis of five of the six experiments
showed that the rate of not-P card selection was also
significantly lower in the presence of an alternative
antecedent.
The Q and not-P cards on the selection task are
logically equivalent to the DA and AC inferences.
Suppressing the rate at which they are selected is
analogous to suppressing the rate at which the invalid
inferences are made. One prediction about our
mechanical selection task, therefore, is that the presence
of a second rule specifying an additional antecedent
should produce suppression on those cards which are
logically equivalent to the MP and MT inferences i.e.
the P and not-Q cards. However, we predict that this
will not be the case.
Instead we expect rates of antecedent card selection
(both true and false antecedent cards) to decrease in the
presence of an additional antecedent. This prediction is
based on our assumption that in reasoning about an
hypothesis concerning a mechanical device people will
incorporate into their representation the hypothesized
causal status of the antecedent with respect to the
consequent. Based on previous work (Hegarty, 1992;
Schwartz & Black, 1996) we hypothesize that they will
prefer to examine the results for the effect of
manipulating the antecedent rather than vice versa.
Such a testing strategy should be significantly reduced
in the presence of a second rule containing an additional
(and perhaps conjointly necessary) antecedent.

Method
Participants: 90 female and 21 male students at the
University of Durham participated in this experiment.
Participants' mean age was 20.5 years and age ranged
from 17 to 42 years.
Design, Materials and Procedure: There were two
groups of participants in this experiment. The first
received a one-rule selection task containing a scenario
and just one rule. The other group of participants
received a two-rule selection task comprising of the

same scenario and rule to be tested as well as a second
rule specifying an additional antecedent for the
consequent in the first rule. For all participants the
scenario and the rule to be tested were as follows:
A friend of yours, who works in a factory, takes you on a
tour of her place of work. She points to a large pipe and
says that the cooling system in the factory obeys the
following rule:
If the valve is open then water will flow through the
pipe
You are interested in checking whether the cooling
system does follow the rule your friend has told you
about. Below are four cards which refer to tests that have
been carried out on the cooling system. On one side of
each of these cards is recorded whether the valve was
open when the test was carried out whilst on the other
side is recorded whether the water was flowing at the
time of the test. Please indicate by circling the
appropriate card or cards, which one(s) you need to turn
over to decide whether the rule is true or false.
Remember the rule you are testing is:
If the valve is open then water will flow through the
pipe

The second rule received by half of the participants
was as follows:
If the pipe is free from blockages then water will flow
through the pipe

Participants in this latter group were reminded that their
task was to test the first rule. Finally, all participants
saw four cards labelled ‘Valve open’, ‘Valve closed’,
‘Water flowing’ and ‘Water not flowing’. They were
asked to indicate those card(s) which were necessary in
order to decide whether the rule was true or false.

Results
We performed three analyses on our results. The first
examined the effects of experimental condition on
individual card selection frequencies whilst the second
was of the effect of number of rules on the rate at which
antecedent and consequent cards were selected. In
addition, we analyzed the frequency of various card
combination selections.
Individual Card Selection Frequencies: Our first
analysis was of the effects of our number of rules
manipulation on the rate at which individual cards were
selected in the experiment. These rates are presented in
Table 1 below.
Chi-square analyses showed no significant effects of
number of rules on the rate at which any of the cards
were selected (P card: χ2(1) = 1.73, p > .18; not-P card:
χ2(1) = 1.40, p > .23; Q card: χ2(1) = 1.96, p > .16;
not-Q card: χ2(1) = .15, p > .70). As the presence of a

second rule has previously been found to significantly
affect the total number of cards selected by participants
(Feeney & Handley, 2000) we tested for an effect of our
number of

rules manipulation on the total selected in this
experiment. This effect was not significant (t(109) =
.365, p > .71). The mean total for the one rule condition
was 1.82 cards (S.D. = .60) and 1.78 cards (S.D. = .74)
for the two-rules condition.
Cause vs. Effect Selections: To test our predictions
about cause and effect card selections we analysed the
rate of cause and effect selections. For the purposes of
this analysis we computed the number of cause and
effect selections made by each participant, where a
cause selection was defined as the selection of either of
the antecedent cards and an effect selection as choosing
either of the consequent cards. The mean numbers of
each type of selection are shown in Figure 1 below.
We performed a 2x2 mixed design Anova on the
cause and effect data. The between participants variable
in this analysis was number of rules whilst the within
participants factor was the number of selections
concerning the hypothesized cause vs. the number of
selections concerning the hypothesized effect specified
in the rule. This analysis produced a non-significant
main effect of number of rules (F(1, 109) = .133, MSE
= .227), a highly significant main effect of cause vs.
effect (F(1, 109) = 33.40, MSE = .385, p < .001) as well
as a significant interaction between the within and
between participant variables (F(1, 109) = 4.94, MSE =
.385, p < .028). Tests for simple effects showed that

there were significantly more antecedent (or cause)
selections in the one-rule condition than in the two rule
condition (F(1, 109) = 4.964, MSE = .243, p < .028).
The difference due to number of rules on the rate of
consequent (or effect) selections was not significant
(F(1, 109) = 1.965, MSE = .369, p > .16).
Finally, in order to analyze the effect of our number
of rules manipulation on relative rates of cause and
effect card selections, we computed an index for each
participant of their total of cause selections minus their
total of effect selections. The effect of the number of
rules manipulation on this index was significant (t(109)
= 2.22, p < .029). In the one rule condition the mean
score on this index was .667 (S.D. = .932) whereas in
the two rule condition the mean score was .296 (S.D. =
.816).
Card Combination Frequencies: Our final analysis
was of the card combination frequency data from the
experiment. As may be seen from Table 2, the rate of
logically correct responding was not affected by our
experimental manipulation with 4 out of 57 participants
choosing the logically correct combination in the onerule condition versus 5 out of 54 in the two-rule
condition. The most striking effect of our number of
rules manipulation on the combinations of cards that
participants choose to select concerned the combined
selection of the P and not-P cards only. In the one-rule
condition 13 participants (23%) chose this combination
whereas in the two-rule condition it was chosen by only
4 participants (7%). This difference is statistically
significant (χ2 (1) = 5.07, p < .02) and is in the
direction suggested by our hypothesis concerning how
people represent and test causal rules concerning
mechanical devices.

Discussion
The results of this experiment support our predictions
about how people test causal rules concerning
mechanical devices. Across both conditions we found a
significantly greater rate of antecedent than consequent
selection. This is not surprising and is probably true of
most selection task experiments (although for an
important exception, see below). Of much more
immediate interest is the finding that the difference
between the rate of antecedent and consequent card
selections was significantly greater in the one-rule
condition than in the two-rule condition. In addition, the
rate at which people selected antecedent cards was
significantly greater in the one-rule condition than in
the two-rule condition although the (non-significant)
rate of suppression due to the presence of a second rule
was the same for each antecedent card. Finally,
participants in the one-rule condition were significantly
more likely to select the combination of cause present
and cause absent cards than they were in the two- rule
condition.
We argue that this pattern of results suggests that
people’s representation of the rule contains information
about the putative causal status of the antecedent and
when considering the possible consequences of the
various tests of the rule people primarily consider tests
where the hypothesized cause is manipulated. When
compared to the results of selection task experiments
where participants are asked to test a standard
indicative rule, this experiment may be seen to have
produced a very high rate (40%) of not-P card selection
in the one rule condition. For example, in the metaanalysis reported by Handley and Feeney (2000) of
single-rule conditions from five experiments on the
standard indicative selection task, 24% of the 272
participants whose data were included were found to
have selected the not-P card. We argue that the elevated
rate of not-P selection found in this experiment is due to
the use of a counterfactual strategy to test the causal
claim made in the experimental rule. In addition to
testing for the presence of the effect in the presence of
the putative cause, participants were interested in
looking to see whether the effect was present or absent
when the hypothesized cause was absent.
Strikingly, when an additional antecedent calls the
sufficiency of the putative cause into question, people
are significantly less likely to select antecedent cards. A
reduction in P card selections is expected given that the
second rule may lead people to question the sufficiency
of the antecedent for the consequent to occur. However,
the selection of the not-P card may still be informative
regarding the truth of the causal rule. Consider for
example the two possible outcomes given the closure of
the valve, the absence of water flow or the presence of
flow. Assuming the device is working we may expect to
observe an absence of water flow when the valve is
closed. However, this absence may also be caused if the

antecedent of the second conditional is not satisfied,
that is if the pipe is blocked. Hence observing the
absence of the effect in the absence of the cause is not
informative about the truth of the rule. However,
imagine instead that we observed water flowing when
the valve was closed. This case would appear more
informative regarding the question of whether the
mechanical device is operating correctly. What our
results suggest is that some participants consider only
the first outcome. Hence, they regard the not-P card as
uninformative and do not choose it.

Different Types of Causal Hypothesis?
Although our predictions were induced from the
literature on mechanical reasoning, our results are of
obvious relevance to the literature on causal cognition.
For example, it is interesting to compare our results to
those of Green & Over (2000) who examined decision
theoretic effects in how people test causal conditional
hypotheses such as the following:
(3) If you drink from the well then you will get cholera
Across all of their conditions, the rate of antecedent
selections never exceeded the rate of consequent
selections to the same degree as was true of our one rule
condition. Collapsed across conditions, their rate of
consequent selections was, in fact, marginally greater
than the rate of antecedent selections (a total of 171
consequent selections vs. 169 antecedent selections).
These results are in stark contrast to our own findings.
Green and Over's experiment was designed to test
ideas concerning the relationship between the
contingency table and causal hypothesis testing. Their
results show that people are sensitive to the
probabilities of the cause and the effect when deciding
which cards to select. We believe that our results are
different to theirs because we asked our participants to
test a causal mechanical rule whereas their experiment
concerned a causal medical rule. O'Brien, Costa &
Overton (1986) have also found results suggesting that
there are domain-specific differences in causal
reasoning. In their experiment participants were asked
what implications each of the four cases (cause present
+ effect present; cause present + effect absent; cause
absent + effect present; cause absent + effect absent)
had for a variety of hypotheses concerning medical and
mechanical causal relationships. For all cases except the
cause absent + effect absent case, participants were
significantly less certain about the medical hypothesis
than about the mechanical hypothesis.
One way to conceive of O'Brien et al's result is that
people are unwilling to accept a medical hypothesis in
the light of information about just a few exemplars
whereas they have more confidence about the status of
a mechanical hypothesis given a few confirming or
disconfirming cases. In other words, causal medical

hypotheses require reasoning that is likely to be
probabilistic in nature whereas causal mechanical
hypotheses need not (of course it is possible to design a
mechanical task that encourages probabilistic reasoning
- see Kirby, 1994).
There are several factors that might be involved in
causing one type of reasoning to be essentially
probabilistic and the other deterministic. First, it is
possible that our knowledge about organisms tells us
that even in the presence of a cause, the effect might not
occur. In other words, causal rules about organisms
admit of many disabling conditions. In addition,
illnesses have many possible causes. In Green & Over's
example, someone drinking from the well might be
immune to cholera or cholera might be present in the
well, the local river and the nearby lake. Given all of
these possibilities it makes sense that participants in
O'Brien et al's study were unwilling to make decisions
about the status of a medical rule in the light of
information about individual exemplars. Similarly, it is
unsurprising that participants in Green and Over's
experiment evidenced probabilistic thinking.
Now think about testing a mechanical hypothesis.
Such hypotheses are normally tested via intervention.
That is, if you think that your car won't start because the
plugs are dirty, you will clean the plugs and then try to
start the car. If the car starts your hypothesis has been
confirmed, if not then it has been disconfirmed. In
either case it is unlikely that you will repeat the
procedure several times in case of the operation of
disabling conditions or alternative causes. Similarly,
when interacting with a novel electronic device (see
Klahr & Dunbar, 1988) people do not perform the same
test several times in order to establish the effect of some
manipulation. Their reasoning in such cases tends to be
non-probabilistic.
This distinction, between probabilistic causal
reasoning and consequential (or deductive) causal
reasoning also relates to the literature on mechanical
reasoning described in the introduction. The systems
that Hegarty (1992) and Schwartz & Black (1996)
required their participants to reason about were closed
and so did not admit of disabling conditions or
alternative causes. Of course, a particular manipulation
to the system might not cause the expected effect but
given the diagrams that people were shown, disabling
conditions and alternative causes were unlikely to be
available to reasoners. Accordingly, a strategy based on
the piecemeal animation of the device in the causally
appropriate direction will be adopted. For analogous
reasons, our participants were interested in tests of the
hypothesis about the cooling system that involved direct
manipulations to the putative cause. Once the
possibility of disabling conditions were introduced, they
were significantly less interested in such tests.
