  I am sympathetic to David Lewis’s (1972) account of
psychophysical identifications.        Lewis claims that
identifying the neural correlates of mental states requires
an understanding of the platitudes about mental states.
This seems the right way to go about identifying the
neural correlates of mental states inasmuch as mental
states are the sensations, thoughts, desires, emotions, etc.
that we report having. This should not preclude the
importance of scientific psychology in making the
identifications. Scientific psychology will have to draw
distinctions that the folk do not always make themselves
with respect to their mental states. These distinctions are
drawn by running controlled experiments designed to
isolate certain phenomena. But the psychologist can only
design the experiments to draw these distinctions if he
accepts that what he is trying to determine is somehow
determined first by folk psychology.
