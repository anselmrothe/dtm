Goldstone, Lippa, and Shiffrin (2001) have devised an
ingenious technique for detecting the presence of
demand effects in data of this kind. The analysis works
by comparing the pattern of changes in similarity
relationships among items in a learning set relative to a
neutral item not included in training. If the similarity
judgments of pairs including the neutral item change in
ways that are predictable from the compression or
expansion effects that occur for categorized items, this
must be due to actual changes in the underlying
similarity space and not demand effects, since the
neutral item was never categorized.
   For our data set, the absolute difference for each
participant between all possible within-group and
between-group pairs of pairs involving the neutral
stimulus was calculated, averaging separately across
each group. Separate 2 (group: learning vs. control) by
2 (pair of pair type: within vs. between) ANOVAs with
repeated measures on the second variable were
conducted for both the A-root and the G-root groups.
The pattern of results was the same as that reported
above. There was thus no evidence that the observed
compression was due to a demand effect for either         Figure 3. Shows the two-dimensional MDS analysis
