Decision-making Much everyday decision-making
depends on subjective assessments of probability. For
instance, the premium one is willing to pay for health
insurance depends on a subjective assessment of the
likelihood of getting hospitalized for the cases that the
health insurance covers (see Johnson et al., 1993). The
events for which an insurance provides coverage can be
described in many ways. The results we report here can
presumably be extended to the domain of decision-
making.
