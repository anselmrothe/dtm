Abstract
Binding theory is the component of grammar that regulates the interpretation of noun phrases. Certain syntactic configurations involving picture noun phrases (PNPs)
are problematic for the standard formulation of binding
theory, which has prompted competing proposals for revisions of the theory. Some authors have proposed an account based on structural constraints, while others have
argued that anaphors in PNPs are exempt from binding
theory, but subject to pragmatic restrictions. In this paper,
we present an experimental study that aims to resolve this
dispute. The results show that structural factors govern
the binding possibilities in PNPs, while pragmatic factors
play only a limited role. However, the structural factors
identified differ from the ones standardly assumed.

Introduction
Linguistic Intuitions The data on which linguists base
their theories typically consist of grammaticality judgments, i.e., intuitive judgments of the well-formedness of
utterances in a given language. When a linguist obtains
a grammaticality judgment, he or she performs a small
experiment on a native speaker; the resulting data are behavioral data in the same way as other measurements of
linguistic performance (e.g., the reaction time data used
in psycholinguistics). However, in contrast to experimental psychologists, linguists are generally not concerned
with methodological issues, and typically none of the
standard experimental controls are imposed in collecting data for linguistic theory. As Schütze’s (1996) recent
work on empirical issues in linguistics demonstrates,
such methodological negligence can seriously compromise the data obtained. Schütze (1996) argues for a more
reliable mode of data elicitation in linguistics, based on
standard methods from experimental psychology.
Recently, Bard, Robertson, and Sorace (1996) and
Cowart (1997) demonstrated how the experimental
paradigm of magnitude estimation (ME) makes it possible to address problems such as the ones raised by
Schütze. ME is an experimental technique standardly
used in psychophysics to measure judgments of sensory
stimuli (Stevens, 1975). It requires subjects to estimate
the magnitude of physical stimuli by assigning numerical values proportional to the stimulus magnitude they
perceive. Highly stable judgments can be achieved for
a whole range of sensory modalities, such as brightness, loudness, or tactile stimulation. Bard et al. (1996)
demonstrated that linguistic judgments can be elicited in
the same way as judgments of sensory stimuli, and that
ME can yield reliable and fine-grained measurements of
linguistic intuitions.
The present paper applies the ME methodology to a
longstanding dispute in linguistic theory, viz., the binding theoretic status of picture noun phrases (PNPs).
Binding in PNPs has generated considerable interest in
the literature, and has prompted a number of revisions of
standard binding theory. However, there is considerable
disagreement on both the relevant data (i.e., coreference
judgments for PNPs) and on the theoretical conclusions

to be drawn from these data. In this paper, we demonstrate how the use of experimentally elicited coreference
judgments can resolve such theoretical disputes.
Binding Theory and Exempt Anaphors Binding theory (BT) is the component of grammar that regulates
the interpretation of noun phrases (NPs). Three types of
noun phrases are generally distinguished: (a) full NPs
(e.g., Hanna, the woman, every woman ), (b) pronouns
(e.g., he, her ), and (c) anaphors (e.g., herself, each other ).
The task of BT is to determine which noun phrases in a
given syntactic domain can be coreferential, i.e., refer to
the same individual. Coreference is normally indicated
with subscripts:
(1)

a. Hannai admires *heri /herselfi .
b. Hannai thinks that Peter admires heri /*herselfi .

In example (1a), the proper name Hanna and the pronoun
her cannot refer to the same person, i.e., they cannot be
coreferential (as indicated by the ‘*’). The pronoun cannot be bound by the proper name. In (1b), on the other
hand, Hanna is a potential binder for her, i.e., coreference is possible. The possibilities for anaphor binding
are exactly reversed; Hanna must bind (i.e., corefer with)
herself in (1a), but cannot do so in (1b).
There are distinct structural conditions that determine
the binding possibilities for the different kinds of NPs.
Principle C of BT deals with the binding requirement
for full NPs, and will not concern us here. Principle A
captures the binding requirements for anaphors; in early
formulations, it states that an anaphor has to be bound
within a certain local domain (Chomsky, 1981). The local domain is defined using c-command, a structural notion defined on trees. Principle B, on the other hand,
states that pronouns cannot be bound within the local domain. It follows that anaphors and pronouns are predicted
to be in complementary distribution, i.e., anaphors can be
bound where pronouns cannot be bound, and vice versa.
It was subsequently observed that this complementarity breaks down in certain structures. A case that has
generated much theoretical discussion is PNPs, where
anaphors and pronouns are equally acceptable:
(2)

Hannai found a picture of heri /herselfi .

There is also the further complication that in PNPs with
possessors (3) and in PNPs that are arguments of certain verbs (4) the complementarity between pronouns
and anaphors seems to resurface:
(3)
(4)

Peteri found Hanna j ’s picture of *her j /herself j .
Hannai took a picture of *heri /herselfi .

Note that (4) is meant with the sense of take as in creating a photograph, not as in physically removing a picture.
A number of authors have argued for a revised version
of BT based on data such as (2), (3), and (4). Chomsky (1986) restates BT such that there is an asymmetry
between pronouns and anaphors in certain contexts, including PNPs without possessors. For (4), Chomsky and
Lasnik (1995) propose that there is a covert possessor.
With these revisions, the predicted pattern of data is exactly as in (2)–(4). We will refer to this approach as the
structural account of binding in PNPs.

Some more recent work, however, has proposed a
pragmatic account of the PNP data in (2)–(4) (e.g., Kuno,
1987; Pollard & Sag, 1994; Reinhart & Reuland, 1993).
These authors have observed that in certain configurations anaphors are exempt from BT. One such configuration is PNPs without possessors, as in (2) and (4). According to this view, the anaphor in (2) is not subject
to Principle A, but is rather governed by pragmatic constraints, where relevant factors include referentiality, definiteness, and aspect. It is important to note that even the
versions of BT that postulate exempt anaphors still maintain that Principle A holds of anaphors in PNPs when
there is an overt possessor: although the anaphor in (2) is
exempt, the anaphors in (3) and (4) are still subject to BT.
The present study attempts to clarify the empirical status of exempt anaphors. We present the results of an experiment that tests the influence of both structural and
pragmatic factors on coreference in PNPs. This experiment uses the magnitude estimation (ME) paradigm to
establish the coreference intuitions of linguistically naive
subjects. (For other studies demonstrating the usefulness
of experimental data in clarifying BT facts, see Cowart,
1997; Gordon & Hendrick, 1997.)
Before we discuss the results of this experiment, we
present a control study designed to validate our experimental paradigm. To our knowledge, ME has never been
applied to coreference judgments, hence we must show
that its results are consistent with the theoretical literature and replicate previous experimental data.

Experiment 1: Control Study
The control study was designed as a replication of Experiment 3 of the study of coreference by Gordon and
Hendrick (1997). It investigated basic effects of Principles A, B, and C of BT. Eight different binding configurations were tested, three of which occurred either with
or without c-command (see Chomsky, 1981, for details
on c-command). Table 1 lists the binding configuration
tested by Gordon and Hendrick (1997). It also summarizes the predictions of standard BT for these configurations, and gives example stimuli.

Predictions
Our hypothesis is that ME generates valid coreference
judgments. We therefore predict that the same significant effects as in Gordon and Hendrick’s (1997) original study will be present, even though our replication
used an ME task instead of the ordinal judgment task employed by Gordon and Hendrick (1997). Another difference is that we conduced our experiment over the World
Wide Web, while the Gordon and Hendrick (1997) administered a conventional questionnaire. The web-based
methodology entails differences in sampling and experimental procedure, which increases the need for a validation study.

Method
Subjects Fifteen participants were recruited over the
Internet by postings to newsgroups and mailing lists. All
participants were self-reported native speakers of English
and naive to syntactic theory.
Materials Following Gordon and Hendrick (1997), the
design contained one factor, viz., binding configuration
(Ana) with eight levels. Three lexicalizations were used;
one was the original lexicalization used by Gordon and
Hendrick (1997), the other two were new lexicalizations,
designed in analogy with the original one. This resulted
in a set of 24 items (see Table 1 for sample stimuli).

Procedure The method used was ME as proposed by
Stevens (1975) for psychophysics and extended to linguistic stimuli by Bard et al. (1996) and Cowart (1997).
Subjects first saw a set of instructions that explained
the concept of numerical ME using line length. Subjects
were instructed to make length estimates relative to the
first line they would see, the reference line. They were
told to give the reference line an arbitrary number, and
then assign a number to each following line so that it represented how long the line was in proportion to the reference line. Several example lines and corresponding numerical estimates were provided to illustrate the concept
of proportionality. Then subjects were told that linguistic acceptability could be judged in the same way as line
length, and that this experiment required them to judge
the acceptability of coreference. Following Gordon and
Hendrick (1997), this was defined as follows: ‘Your task
is to judge how acceptable each sentence is by assigning
a number to it. By acceptability we mean the following:
Every sentence will contain two expressions in ALL CAP ITALS . A sentence is acceptable if these two expressions
can refer to the same person.’ The task was illustrated by
examples.
After reading the instructions, subjects took part in a
training phase designed to familiarize them with the task.
In the training phase, subjects were ask to use ME to
judge the length of a set of lines. Then, a set of practice
items (similar to the experimental items) were administered to familiarize subjects with applying ME to linguistic stimuli. Finally, subjects had to judge the experimental items. Each subject judged all 24 experimental stimuli
and a set of 24 fillers, i.e., a total of 48 items.
The experiment was conducted over the web using WebExp 2.1 (Keller, Corley, Corley, Konieczny, &
Todirascu, 1998), an interactive software package for
web-based psycholinguistic experimentation. Keller and
Alexopoulou (2001) present a detailed discussion of the
safeguards that WebExp puts in place to ensure the authenticity and validity of the data collected, and also
present a validation study comparing web-based and labbased judgment data (for a WebExp validation study using sentence completion data, see Corley & Scheepers,
in press).

Results
The data were normalized by dividing each numeric
judgment by the modulus value that the subject had assigned to the reference sentence. This operation creates a
common scale for all subjects. Then the data were transformed by taking the decadic logarithm. This transformation ensures that the judgments are normally distributed
and is standard practice for ME data (Bard et al., 1996).
All analyses and figures are based on normalized, logtransformed judgments.
The average judgments for the different conditions are
graphed in Figure 1 for the original study and in Figure 2 for our replication. Visual inspection shows that
the replication experiment produces the same acceptability pattern for each of the binding configurations.
This was confirmed by the statistical analyses. Gordon and Hendrick (1997) report a significant main effect
of binding configuration (Ana), which was also present
in our data (F1 (7, 98) = 17.561, p <. 0005; F2 (7, 14) =
295.262, p <. 0005). They also found that the acceptability of the name-anaphor configuration increased under ccommand, which was replicated in our data (F1 (1, 14) =
17.057, p = .001; F2 (1, 2) = 2389.474, p <. 0005). Another finding was that c-command significantly reduces
the acceptability of coreference name-pronoun configurations. This effect was also present in the replica-

p = .003). An effect of c-command on the acceptability
of pronoun-name configurations was also found both in
the original data set and in our replication (F1 (1, 14) =
25.949, p <. 0005; F2 (1, 2) = 181.980, p = .005).1 Finally, a comparison of the name-pronoun and the namename configurations showed that names are favored as
antecedents (F1 (1, 14) = 13.770, p <. 002; F2 (1, 2) =
192.301, p = .005), in line with what Gordon and Hendrick (1997) found.
To further compare the results of the original experiment and our validation study, we conducted a correlation analysis comparing the mean judgments for each cell
in the experiment. A high correlation coefficient was obtained (r1 = .9198, p = .001, N = 8). (No by-item correlation coefficient could be computed as Gordon and Hendrick (1997) fail to report by-item analyses.)
1 Note that standard BT fails to predict the reduced acceptability of configuration (ii). A possible explanation might be
that this configuration involves cataphoric reference (i.e., the
pronoun refers forwards instead of backwards).

Discussion
In this study, we used ME to replicate a published experiment on coreference judgments that used a conventional ordinal scale (Gordon and Hendrick’s (1997) Experiment 3). We obtained the same significant effects as
in the original and a high correlation with the original
data set, which amounts to a full replication of the original study.
This result indicates that the ME paradigm is suitable for investigating judgments of linguistic coreference, which are vital for testing claims from BT. Previous
uses of ME were limited to grammaticality judgments
(Bard et al., 1996; Cowart, 1997). The successful replication also reassures us that psycholinguistic data collected
over the web yield results comparable to data generated
by a conventional lab-based methodology, in line with
previous findings by Keller and Alexopoulou (2001) and
Corley and Scheepers (in press).
Finally, the present experiment allows us to establish
a baseline for further experiments on linguistic coreference. It encompassed only clear-cut cases of coreference that are uncontroversial in the binding theoretical
literature. It is important to establish the validity of our
methodology for such clear-cut cases before moving to
investigate more controversial issues such as binding in
PNPs, where the theoretical and empirical claims in the
syntactic literature differ widely. Binding in PNPs is the
subject of the next experiment.

Experiment 2: Structural and Pragmatic
Factors in Coreference
Based on the results from the control experiment, we carried out an experimental study investigating the factors
that determine coreference in PNPs in English. The aim
of this experiment was to provide reliable experimental
data that settles the longstanding dispute about the binding theoretical status of PNPs. In particular, we tested
the claim that PNPs are exempt from BT, and hence their
coreference options are governed by pragmatic, rather
than structural factors.
Structural Factors The current experiment tested the
influence of structural factors on binding in PNPs by
comparing the behavior of anaphors and pronouns in six
configurations, listed in Table 2. Two structural factors
were tested.
Firstly, the position of the binder, which can either be
the subject of the matrix clause (as in configurations (i)–
(iv) in Table 2), or the possessor of the PNP (as in configurations (v) and (vi) in Table 2). Secondly, the absence
of a possessor (as in configurations (i) and (ii)), or its
presence (as in configurations (iii)–(vi) in Table 2). The
experiment contained three subdesigns, which tested the
configurations (i) and (ii), (iii) and (iv), and (v) and (vi),
respectively.

(v) Hanna found Peter’s picture of him.
(vi) Hanna found Peter’s picture of himself.

Pragmatic Factors The second aim of the present experiment was to investigate the influence of pragmatic
factors on the coreference in PNPs. Such factors have received much attention in the theoretical literature. However, no quantitative studies have been conducted to determine to what extent these factors influence coreference, and how they interact with structural factors.
Three pragmatic factors were investigated. The first
one is definiteness of the PNP. As an example of definiteness consider the minimal pair in (5): the PNP in (5a) is
indefinite and the one in (5b) is definite.
(5)

a. Hannai found a picture of heri /herselfi .
b. Hannai found the picture of heri /herselfi .

The second factor is the aspectual class of the matrix
verb, illustrated in example (6): find and lose are examples of achievement verbs, while take and destroy are
accomplishment verbs; find and take are [ existence],
i.e., they presuppose the existence of their object, while
lose and destroy are [−existence], i.e., they do not carry
this presupposition.

Hannai lost a picture of heri /herselfi .

Third, we tested the influence of the referentiality of the
binder, as illustrated in (7):
(7)

a. Hannai found Peter’s picture of heri /herselfi .
b. The womani found Peter’s picture of heri /herselfi .
c. Each womani found Peter’s picture of heri /herselfi .

The pragmatic factors were included in the three subdesigns of the present experiment. The factors definiteness
and verb class were included in the first subdesign, while
referentiality was part of the second and third subdesign.

Predictions
Based on the theoretical literature (see Introduction), we
predict that anaphors in PNPs are exempt from local
binding (i.e., binding within the PNP), unless the PNP
has a possessor, in which case the anaphor must be bound
by the possessor (see examples (2) and (3)). We also predict that pronouns must be locally free from a possessor, if there is one. Table 2 lists the configurations and
the associated predictions, together with example stimuli. Note that we expect that the relative acceptability of
pronouns and anaphors is the same in configurations (i),
(ii) and (iii). Configurations (iv) and (v) are predicted
to be unacceptable, while (vi) is predicted to be acceptable. These constructions differ in terms of their syntactic
structure (antecedent is the subject or the possessor; possessor is present or not). We expect to find no main effect
of binding configuration for (i) versus (ii), but for pairs
(iii)/(iv) and (v)/(vi) we expect binding configuration to
have a significant main effect.
If the pragmatic approach to binding in PNPs is correct, then we also expect that the pragmatic factors verb
class, definiteness, and referentiality have an effect on
coreference. The underlying theoretical assumption is

prediction

that coreference for exempt NPs is governed by pragmatics, rather than by structural principles. Hence we predict
an interaction of binding configuration with verb class
and definiteness in the first subexperiment, and an interaction of binding configuration with referentiality in the
second and third subexperiment.

Method
Subjects Fifty-two native speakers of English volunteered to participate. All participants were naive to syntactic theory.
Materials The experimental materials included three
subdesigns. The first subdesign investigated binding configurations (i) and (ii): name-pronoun and name-anaphor
with the antecedent in the subject and without a possessor. The second subdesign compared binding configurations (iii) and (iv): name-pronoun and name-anaphor
with the antecedent in the subject and a possessor in the
PNP. The third subdesign dealt with configurations (v)
and (vi): name-pronoun and name-anaphor with the antecedent as the possessor of the PNP.
This means that in each of the three subdesigns the
factor binding configuration (Ana) had two levels: namepronoun or name-anaphor. In the first subdesign, this
factor was crossed with Def and Verb, representing the
two pragmatic factors definiteness of the PNP and aspectual class of the main verb. Def had two levels (definite, indefinite, see (5)), Verb had three levels (achievement [ existence], accomplishment [ existence], accomplishment [−existence] (see (6a), (6c), (6d)). This
yielded a total of Ana × Def × Verb = 2 × 2 × 3 = 12 cells
for the first subdesign.
In the second and third subdesigns, the structural factor Ana was crossed with the pragmatic factor referentiality (Ref ), which had three levels (proper name, definite NP, quantified NP, see (7)). The second and third
subdesign therefore had Ana×Ref = 2×3 = 6 cells each.
All three subdesigns taken together had a total of
24 cells. Four lexicalizations were used for each of the
cells, which resulted in a total of 96 stimuli. A set of 24
fillers was used, designed to cover the whole acceptability range.
Procedure The experimental procedure was the same
as in Experiment 1. The stimulus set was divided into
four subsets of 24 stimuli by placing the items in a Latin
square. Each subject judged one of these subsets and
24 fillers, i.e., a total of 48 items.

Results
The data were preprocessed as in Experiment 1. Separate
ANOVAs were conducted for each subexperiment.
Structural Factors In the first subexperiment (binding
configurations (i) and (ii)), we found a large and highly
significant main effect of Ana (F1 (1, 51) = 137.471, p <
.0005; F2 (1, 3) = 105.005, p = .002). Anaphors (mean =

.1954). In the second subexperiment (binding configurations (iii) and (iv)), Ana failed to reach significance: both
anaphors (mean = .5262) and pronouns (mean = .4369)
were equally acceptable. In the third subexperiment
(binding configurations (v) and (vi)), again a main effect of Ana was present (F1 (1, 51) = 101.632, p <. 0005;
F2 (1, 3) = 34.677, p = .010). Anaphors (mean = .6338)
were more acceptable than pronouns (mean = .1832).
The coreference judgments for the six binding configurations (see Table 2) are graphed in Figure 3.
Pragmatic Factors The ANOVA for the first subexperiment also revealed a significant interaction of Verb
and Ana (F1 (2, 102) = 11.275, p <. 0005; F2 (2, 6) =
6.193, p = .035). This interaction is graphed in Figure 4,
showing a decrease in the acceptability of pronouns for
[ existence] accomplishment verbs. An interaction of
Def and Ana was also found, which however was significant by subjects only (F1 (1, 51) = 11.849, p = .001;
F2 (1, 3) = 2.168, p = .237). Figure 5 shows that the acceptability of pronouns is increased for definite PNPs.
The ANOVA for the second subexperiment showed
an interaction of Ref and Ana, significant by subjects
only (F1 (2, 102) = 3.979, p = .049; F2 (2, 6) = 2.745,
p = .142). This interaction is depicted in Figure 6, showing a decrease in the acceptability of pronouns if the antecedent is a quantified NP. No Ref /Ana interaction was
present in the third subexperiment (see Figure 7).

Discussion
The theoretical predictions for the acceptability of the
stimuli are listed in Table 2. Theory also predicts that
anaphors are exempt from BT in configuration (i), and
that structural factors should fail to have an influence on

the acceptability of coreference for these structures. Contrary to this prediction, the present experiment revealed
a significant influence of structural factors, although not
in a way that any existing account predicts. Four major
results were obtained.
In cases where the antecedent is in the subject and
there is no possessor in the PNP (configurations (i)
and (ii), see Table 2), structural and pragmatic binding
theories alike predict that pronouns are fully acceptable
and that pronouns and anaphors are equally acceptable.
Our first and second major results are the falsification of
both these predictions. Pronouns were significantly less
acceptable than anaphors (see Figure 3). A comparison
with standard cases of BT tested in Experiment 1 (see
Figure 2) indicates that anaphors are fully acceptable in
this configuration, while pronouns are of intermediate acceptability (but not fully unacceptable compared to, e.g.,
name-pronoun configurations with c-command).
Configurations (iii) and (iv), where the antecedent is
in the subject, but there is a possessor, demonstrate our
third major result. Here BT falsely predicts that anaphors

are not exempt according to the pragmatic versions of
BT, as there is a possessor. We found that pronouns and
anaphors are both highly acceptable; no significant acceptability difference could be detected (see Figure 3). In
other words, contrary to all that has been written in the
syntactic literature, anaphors can be bound by the subject
even in PNPs with possessors.
Our fourth result concerns the third structure we investigated (configurations (v) and (vi)), where the antecedent is the possessor in the PNP rather than the subject. We found the same behavior as in configurations (i)
and (ii): the anaphors were fully acceptable in this configuration, while pronouns were significantly less acceptable, but not completely unacceptable compared to the
configurations investigated in Experiment 1 (see Figure 2). The prediction for a PNP with a possessor is that
a pronoun bound by the possessor is completely ungrammatical and that a pronoun bound by the subject is completely grammatical. This prediction was not supported
by our results. We found that a pronoun bound by the
possessor is as acceptable as a pronoun bound by a subject, but that both are only moderately acceptable.
We also investigated the influence of the pragmatic
factors verb class, definiteness, and referentiality on
coreference in PNPs. The underlying theoretical assumption is that coreference for exempt anaphors is governed by pragmatic factors, rather than by structural constraints. In binding configurations (i) and (ii), we found
a significant effect of verb class: the acceptability of
pronouns was reduced for [ existence] accomplishment
verbs (see Figure 4). This accords with intuitions reported in the literature (see Introduction, (4)). Furthermore, we found a significant effect of definiteness: pronouns are more acceptable with definite PNPs than with
indefinite ones (see Figure 5). However, the verb class
effect and the definiteness effect were weak and did not
change the overall acceptability pattern, i.e., the preference for anaphors over pronouns.
In configurations (iii) and (iv), we found that the pragmatic factor referentiality has a significant effect on the
acceptability of pronouns, which were less acceptable
if the antecedent is a quantified NP, compared to cases
where the antecedent is a name or a definite NP (see Figure 6). Again, this effect was weak and did not change
the overall pattern, i.e., the fact that both pronouns and
anaphors were highly acceptable in configurations (iii)
and (iv). Finally, we failed to find any effect of referentiality in configurations (v) and (vi) (see Figure 7).

Conclusions
Experiment 1 was a control study that made a methodological contribution. The results showed that the experimental paradigm of magnitude estimation, previously
only used for grammaticality judgment tasks, can be applied successfully to coreference judgments, which form
the empirical basis of binding theory.
Building on this result, Experiment 2 used magnitude
estimation to provide crucial data regarding binding in
PNPs, which have been the subject of much research in
the syntactic literature. The results provide an example
of how experimentation can be used as a tool to settle
debates in linguistic theory.
More specifically, Experiment 2 aimed to clarify the
empirical status of exempt anaphors and provide data to
distinguish between structural and pragmatic accounts of
exempt anaphors. The results show that structural factors govern the binding possibilities in PNPs, while pragmatic factors play only a limited role. However, the structural factors identified differ from the ones standardly
assumed. We found that (i) an anaphor can be bound

from outside the PNP, even if there is a possessor in the
PNP, (ii) anaphors and pronouns bound by the subject are
equally acceptable when there is a possessor, (iii) pronouns are only moderately acceptable when there is no
possessor, and (iv) pronouns bound by the possessor are
also moderately acceptable.
Finding (i) is the most theoretically interesting one,
and has recently been confirmed in an eye-tracking experiment (Runner, Sussman, & Tanenhaus, 2000). It
falsifies a major prediction of all binding theories by
showing that structural factors (subject/no subject, possessor/no possessor) fail to influence the binding of
anaphors in PNPs. This means that the role of structural
factors is even smaller than envisaged by proponents of
pragmatic accounts. For pronouns, however, there is a
structural effect, viz., they are more acceptably bound by
the subject if there is a possessor NP.
In our view, the best way to understand this result is by
making reference to the notion of predication (Pollard &
Sag, 1994; Reinhart & Reuland, 1993). An anaphor must
be bound by a dominating coargument of the predicate
that selects for the anaphor, if there is one. For example,
an anaphor that is in the object position of a matrix clause
must be bound by the subject, because the subject position dominates the object position: both the subject and
object are arguments of the same predicate, i.e., the predicate needs the subject and object to satisfy its syntactic
and semantic requirements. But the possessor of a PNP is
not an argument of the head, as the head does not require
it (i.e., pictures do not necessarily have possessors). This
observation correctly accounts for the full acceptability
of anaphors in PNPs, with or without possessors, and the
necessity for local binding when anaphors are in matrix
argument positions (as in (1)).
We can also use the notion of predication to understand the pattern for [ existence] accomplishment verbs,
as in (4) Hannai took a picture of *heri /herselfi , without
positing a covert possessor. It is possible that speakerhearers treat expressions like take a picture as one predicate, in which case the anaphor or pronoun in such examples is actually a coargument of the subject and governed
by Principle A or B, respectively. Runner (to appear) argues for just such an analysis of predicates like take a
picture based on syntactic and semantic evidence.
