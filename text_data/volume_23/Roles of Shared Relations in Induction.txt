alignment that leads participants to attend to the match-
ing relational structure. Therefore participants who rated
similarity prior to inductive strength judgment were ex-
pected to be able to easily align a shared relation. The
results showed that a shared relation contributes to in-
creasing inductive strength if participants rated similarity
prior to inductive strength judgment.
   The results of Experiment 1 and 2 are consistent with
the proposed structural alignment view, and are also con-
sistent with the fact that shared relations contribute to
soundness ratings of analogy. The proposed structural
alignment view of induction more consistently corre-
