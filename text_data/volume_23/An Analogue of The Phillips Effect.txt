analysis of the false alarms (Figure 5) supports this
position, as there was a greater disruption to the
participants on the “C” trials than on the Random trials,
where the stimulus was completely different from the one
that they were familiar with, and despite the fact that
overall performance was significantly lower on the
Random trials.
                        Conclusion
There is good evidence that stimulus familiarity makes it
easier to detect a change in that stimulus when compared
with participants trained on random stimuli. This is in
addition to the necessary attentional requirements
reported in Rensink et al. (1997). The ability to detect the
change improves with increasing familiarity with the
stimulus.     However, this ability is limited to that
particular stimulus, or ones very close to it, and there is
no advantage for other random stimuli of the same type as
shown by the test blocks given in session 5.
   The mechanism for the detection of the change may be
based, at least in part, on novelty. The use of a distracting
fixed change induces more false alarms on no change
trials than would otherwise be expected. This result
indicates that the strategy of scanning the image for
change cannot completely account for the enhanced
ability to detect the changes. The method for detecting
the changes in a given stimulus may involve a
combination of better stimulus scanning and the use of
novelty to discriminate between familiar stimuli. It is
likely that both mechanisms are important in the detection
of change. The degree to which each is employed will
doubtless depend on both the type and familiarity of the
stimulus.
