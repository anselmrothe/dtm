solely based on the asymmetry of overlap of feature
distributions. Since nearly all cats belong to a narrow
range of distribution embraced by the distribution of the
dog category, dogs are more likely, on the average, to
fall outside this narrow range, within which the
"prototypical" dog also falls and which is precisely
what the network's internal representation should
reflect. Comparing cats and dogs to this "prototypical"
dog should show that cats are situated closer to it in           Figure 6. cluster analysis performed on the input data

terms of the similarity of particular stimuli (and
combinations of stimuli). Truly, the model incorrectly
excludes certain stimuli and not others, thus infants
should present the same behavior pattern with precisely
those stimuli in question. Likewise, if the model, for
certain items but not others, does not present the
discussed asymmetry in interference effects then
infant's behavior should qualitatively reflect the same
catastrophic forgetting. We thus suggest an item based
analysis of networks' and infants' memory and
categorization performances. Finally, we would like to
recall that, by construction, connections networks'
performance depends upon the very selection of certain
stimulus features and not other. Thus, if networks
produce categorization and memory effects similar to
those of infants, then the selection of the particular
features is given support. Nevertheless, it must be
