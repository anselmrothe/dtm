reference is ultimately about: it is a connection be-

   This means that symbolic reference is constituted by
a mapping between relational structures: we regard the
symbols and their referents only insofar as they are part
of a system whose elements stand in specific relations
to each other; the association of symbols and their ref-
erents is determined by the respective relations that
hold between them.
