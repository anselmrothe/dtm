within compounds in this elicitation situation: It is more
difficult and time-consuming to produce the singular form
of an irregular noun when primed with a stimulus of the
plural form than it is to segment the regular plural marker, at
least when it is an easily removable affix like the –s in
English, and thereby retrieve the singular form. It is likely
that the same explanation also works for the children
examined by Gordon (1985). Given these results, we argue
that Gordon’s findings do not provide support for the notion
of innate grammar.
