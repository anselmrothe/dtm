Abstract
The notion of feedback activation from semantics to both
orthography and phonology has recently been used to explain
certain semantic effects in visual word recognition, including
polysemy effects (Hino & Lupker, 1996; Pexman & Lupker,
1999) and synonym effects (Pecher, in press). In the present
research we tested an account based on feedback activation by
investigating a new semantic effect: number of features
(NOF). Words with high NOF (e.g., LION) should activate
richer semantic representations than words with low NOF
(e.g., LIME). Richer semantic representations should facilitate
lexical decision task (LDT) and naming task performance via
feedback activation to orthographic and phonological
representations. The predicted facilitory NOF effects were
observed in both LDT and naming.

Introduction
Although the average speaker or reader of English seldom
notices it, the English language is actually quite ambiguous
in its usage. For example, many English words are
“polysemous”, in that they have multiple meanings (e.g.,
BANK). Thus, deriving the intended meaning requires the
use of context. These polysemous words have been a useful
tool in psycholinguistic research since they allow
researchers the opportunity to study the impact of semantic
ambiguity on word recognition and reading.
There is now considerable evidence that semantic
ambiguity produces a processing advantage in lexical
decision tasks (LDT) and naming tasks. That is, responding
in those tasks is usually faster to polysemous than
nonpolysemous words (Borowsky & Masson, 1996;
Gottlob, Goldinger, Stone, & Van Orden, 1999; Hino &
Lupker, 1996; Hino, Lupker, Sears, & Ogawa, 1998;
Jastrzembski, 1981; Jastrzembski & Stanners, 1975; Kellas,
Ferraro, & Simpson, 1988; Lichacz, Herdman, LeFevre, &
Baird, 1999; Millis & Button, 1989; Pexman & Lupker,
1999; Rubenstein, Garfield, & Millikan, 1970). This effect
has proven difficult to explain for current models of word

recognition. For example, Joordens and Besner (1994)
attempted to simulate polysemy effects using two PDP
models but found that neither model was successful. The
problem is that polysemy involves a one-to-many mapping
between orthography and semantics and, thus, polysemous
words should create competition in the semantic units.
Because Joordens and Besner assumed that lexical decision
performance depends on the settling time in the semantic
units, the inevitable result was that this competition
hindered, rather than facilitated, performance. That is,
according to this and similar models, polysemy should
produce a processing disadvantage in LDTs (for related
discussions see Besner & Joordens, 1995; Kawamoto,
Farrar, & Kello, 1994; Borowsky & Masson, 1996; Piercey
& Joordens, 2000; Rueckl, 1995).
As Hino and Lupker (1996) argued, however, it is
possible to explain polysemy effects within a PDP
framework if slightly different assumptions are made.
Following Balota, Ferraro, and Connor’s (1991) basic
argument, Hino and Lupker assumed that semantic
activation feeds back to the orthographic units. That is,
when a target word is presented, there is initially activation
of an orthographic representation for that word. Very
quickly, there is also activation of a semantic representation
for the target word (and also activation of a phonological
representation). The semantic representation then increases
the activation of the orthographic (and phonological)
representation via feedback connections. Because
polysemous words (e.g., BANK) have a more extensive
semantic representation than nonpolysemous words,
polysemous words would produce more semantic activation
than nonpolysemous words. Hence, the feedback activation
from semantics to orthography should be stronger for
polysemous words than for nonpolysemous words. As a
result, the activation in the orthographic units for
polysemous words should increase more rapidly than that
for nonpolysemous words. Assuming that lexical decision
responses are mainly based on orthographic activation, the
expectation is that LDT responses should be faster for

polysemous than for nonpolysemous words, as is typically
observed.
The explanation for polysemy effects in naming tasks is
similar. For polysemous words, there would be considerable
semantic activation, which would then help activate the
phonological (as well as the orthographic) units. This
semantic activation of phonological units could happen two
ways: via feedforward connections for orthographysemantics-phonology linkages, and also via feedback
connections
for
orthography-phonology-semanticsphonology linkages. In a naming task, it is assumed that
responses are based on activation in the phonological units.
Polysemous words would receive more phonological
activation (via semantics), which would lead to a processing
advantage in the naming task. Thus, according to Hino and
Lupker (1996), polysemy effects in both tasks can be readily
explained within a fully-interactive, PDP-type model of
word recognition if feedback activation is assumed to play
an important role in the process.
Note that certain models of word recognition do assume
an important role for feedback connections. For example,
Van Orden and Goldinger (1994; see also Stone, Vanhoy &
Van Orden, 1997) argued for a system that incorporated
both feedforward and feedback activation between sets of
processing units. Additionally, in Seidenberg and
McClelland’s (1989) PDP model, feedback connections
were proposed, although they were never implemented.
Feedback connections from semantic to orthographic units
were also included in some of Plaut and Shallice’s (1993)
simulations. Thus, models of this sort would be quite
consistent with the existence of polysemy effects.
What should also be noted is that polysemy effects are
not the only effects in the word recognition literature
consistent with Hino and Lupker’s (1996) feedback
activation account. For example, Pexman, Lupker, and Jared
(2001) argued that a feedback activation explanation,
involving feedback from the phonological to the
orthographic units, was required in order to explain
homophone effects. Homophones are words like MAID and
MADE for which multiple spellings (and meanings)
correspond to a single phonological representation. As had
been typically reported (e.g., Rubenstein, Lewis, &
Rubenstein, 1971), homophones produced longer lexical
decision response latencies than control words in Pexman et
al.’s experiments. These homophone effects were most
apparent for low frequency homophones with high
frequency homophone mates, and were larger in LDT when
pseudohomophones (e.g., BRANE) were used as foils (as
compared to pseudoword foils, e.g., PRANE).
In terms of the feedback activation account, homophone
effects are assumed to be caused by a single phonological
representation activating two orthographic representations
(Pexman et al., 2001) while polysemy effects are presumed
to be caused by multiple semantic representations activating
a single orthographic representation (Hino & Lupker, 1996).
That is, in spite of the fact that these two effects go in
opposite directions, they are both presumed to be due to the
basic architecture of the word recognition system (rather

than being due to specific strategies). Pexman and Lupker
(1999) argued that, if this account is correct, the two effects
should occur simultaneously (i.e., in the same trial block)
and both effects should be larger whenever there is
increased opportunity for feedback to affect processing (i.e.,
when pseudohomophone foils are used). As predicted,
Pexman and Lupker found that polysemy and homophone
effects co-occurred and both were significantly larger with
pseudohomophone foils than with pseudoword foils,
supporting the feedback activation account.
One additional result that is consistent with Hino and
Lupker’s (1996) account comes from Pecher’s (in press)
examination of a different semantic factor: number of
synonyms. Whereas polysemous words involve a many-toone feedback mapping from the semantic units to the
orthographic units (which helps increase the activation of
the appropriate orthographic units), words with synonyms
involve a one-to-many feedback mapping from the semantic
units to the orthographic units. Thus, the feedback activation
for a word with synonyms would tend to be dispersed to
different orthographic representations, which should
produce competition at the orthographic level. As a result, in
contrast to the processing advantage created by polysemy,
words with synonyms should be at a processing
disadvantage. Pecher reported that responses were slower
for words with synonyms (e.g., JAIL) than for words
without synonyms (e.g., MILK) in both LDT and naming,
and explained these results in terms of feedback processes.
The purpose of present paper was to provide a new
examination of the feedback activation account. Polysemous
words, like BANK, have a number of different, relatively
distinct, meanings. Thus, according to the feedback
activation account, these words create considerable semantic
activation and, hence, more feedback activation for the
orthographic and phonological units, producing faster
responding. A similar situation should arise with any words
that create relatively more semantic activation, regardless of
whether that activation corresponds to several distinct
meanings. In order to examine this prediction, we
investigated the effect of number of features in LDTs and
naming tasks.
Semantic features are attributes or characteristics that
describe the meaning of a word. For instance, for the word
LAMP, its semantic features might include such things as
“is bright”, “has light bulbs”, “produces heat”, “has a
shade”, etc. The notion that word meanings can be
represented by semantic features has been controversial
(e.g., Keil, 1989; Medin, 1989; Rips, 1989). That is, concept
representations seem to involve much more than feature
information; including such things as general world
knowledge about relations between features, and heuristics
like essentialism (the notion that things like lamps have
“essences”). McRae, de Sa, and Seidenberg (1997; see also
McRae, Cree, Westmacott, & de Sa, 1999) suggested,
however, that featural representations do play an important
role in at least the initial computation of word meaning.
Based on the feedback activation account, it would be
predicted that words with many features would produce

more semantic activation and, hence, more feedback to the
orthographic and phonological units than words with few
features. Thus, in LDTs and naming tasks, faster responding
should be observed for words with a large number of
features than for words with a small number of features.
The suggestion that word recognition may be faster for
words with more semantic activation, or “richer” semantic
representations, is not a new one. In previous research,
effects of concreteness and/or imageability have been
examined (e.g., Cortese, Simpson, & Woolsey, 1997; de
Groot, 1989; James, 1975; Strain & Herdman, 1999; Strain,
Patterson, & Seidenberg, 1995; Zevin & Balota, 2000), with
results tending to show faster responding in LDTs and
naming tasks for concrete or imageable words than for
abstract words. It has been argued, in fact, that highly
imageable or concrete words have richer semantic
representations because they activate more semantic
features than abstract words (Jones, 1985; Plaut & Shallice,
1993). According to the feedback activation account,
however, activation of a larger number of semantic features
should facilitate word recognition even when all of the
stimuli are highly imageable. That is, even if all of the target
words are concrete nouns, if some words activate more
semantic features than others do, they should produce more
rapid responding in word recognition tasks. Thus, there
should be number of features (NOF) effects when
concreteness and imageability have been controlled.
In this research we tested these predictions. Experiments
1A and 1B were LDTs, and 1C was a naming task.

Method
Participants
The participants in these experiments were undergraduate
students at the University of Calgary. There were 40
participants in Experiment 1A, 38 in Experiment 1B, and 35
in Experiment 1C.

Stimuli
Words The word stimuli for Experiments 1A, 1B, and 1C,
were selected from norms provided by Ken McRae (see
McRae & Cree, in press). The McRae norms were collected
by asking participants to list features for a large number of
concrete nouns. Two sets of words were created: one set
consisted of 25 words with low NOF and the other set
consisted of 25 words with high NOF. These sets were
matched on several dimensions. The mean values on these
dimensions, for the selected sets of words, are listed in
Table 1.
Foils There were 60 pseudowords presented in Experiment
1A and 60 pseudohomophones presented in Experiment 1B.

Procedure
On each trial, a letter string was presented in the centre of a
17-inch Sony Trinitron monitor controlled by a MacIntosh
G3 and presented using PsyScope (Cohen, MacWhinney,
Flatt, & Provost, 1993). In Experiments 1A and 1B, lexical-

decision responses were made by pressing either the left
button (labeled NONWORD) or the right button (labeled
WORD) on a PsyScope response box. In Experiment 1C,
naming responses were made into a microphone attached to
a PsyScope response box.

Experiment 1A – Results and Discussion
For this experiment, mean response latencies and mean error
percentages are presented in Table 2. In all experiments,
data were analyzed with subjects (F1 or t1) and, separately,
items (F2 or t2) treated as random factors.
For high NOF words, response latencies were faster and
there were fewer response errors (compared to responses for
low NOF words) and, thus, there were significant NOF
effects in both the latency analysis (t1(39) = 2.95, p < .005,
SE = 5.13; t2(48) = 1.40, p = .16, SE = 15.30), and in the
error analysis (t1(39) = 2.66, p < .01, SE = 0.79; t2(48) =
1.17, p = .25, SE = 1.88).
The results of Experiment 1A demonstrated that
participants could more easily make word/nonword
decisions for high NOF words than for low NOF words.
According to the feedback activation account, this
advantage was due to the additional semantic activation
created by high NOF words. This additional semantic
activation provided stronger feedback to the orthographic
representation for the word presented, enhancing the
activation of its orthographic units and speeding responding.
In order to examine this NOF effect further, we used
pseudohomophones as foils in Experiment 1B. According to
the feedback activation account, these foils make lexical
decisions more difficult because they require participants to
set a higher criterion for orthographic activation. This leads
to longer response times for both words and foils and
increases the opportunity for feedback activation to affect
responding. Thus, if the NOF effect is due to feedback
activation from semantics to orthography, the effect should
be larger in Experiment 1B.

Experiment 1B – Results and Discussion
For this experiment, mean response latencies and mean
error percentages are presented in Table 2.
As in Experiment 1A, response latencies were faster and
there were fewer response errors for high NOF words, and
so there was a significant NOF effect in the latency
analyses (t1(37) = 5.01, p < .001, SE = 7.28; t2(48) = 2.01,
p = .05, SE = 21.30), and in the error analysis (t1(37) =
2.98, p < .005, SE = 0.78; t2(48) = 1.18, p = .24, SE =
1.95).
In Experiment 1C we tested an additional prediction of
the feedback activation account: because semantic
activation also facilitates the activation of phonological
units, high NOF words should also produce faster naming
latencies.

Experiment 1C – Results and Discussion
For this experiment, mean naming latencies and mean error
percentages are presented in Table 3.

For high NOF words, naming latencies were faster and
there were fewer response errors, so there was a significant
NOF effect in the latency analyses (t1(34) = 10.36, p <
.001, SE = 2.96; t2(48) = 2.09, p < .05, SE = 16.38), and in
the error analysis (t1(34) = 2.33, p < .05, SE = 0.45; t2(48)
= 1.41, p = .16, SE = 0.83).
Again, responses were faster for words with high NOF.
This suggests that semantic activation also provides strong
feedback to the phonological units, facilitating naming
responses.
Our 2 sets of words were not perfectly matched; there
were slight differences between sets on several dimensions.
To ensure that these differences were not the source of the

observed effects, we conducted regression analyses. These
analyses showed significant, unique effects of NOF for
response latencies and response errors in Experiment 1A,
response latencies (but not errors) in Experiment 1B, and
naming latencies (but not naming errors) in Experiment 1C.

General Discussion
The present results demonstrate the influence of a
previously unexamined semantic variable on visual word
recognition. In the past, effects have been reported for
concreteness and imageability (e.g., Cortese, Simpson, &
Woolsey, 1997; de Groot, 1989; James, 1975; Strain &
Herdman, 1999; Strain, Patterson, & Seidenberg, 1995;
Zevin & Balota, 2000), and for polysemy (e.g., Borowsky
& Masson, 1996; Gottlob et al., 1999; Hino & Lupker,
1996; Hino et al., 1998; Jastrzembski, 1981; Jastrzembski
& Stanners, 1975; Kellas et al., 1988; Lichacz et al., 1999;
Millis & Button, 1989; Pexman & Lupker, 1999;
Rubenstein et al., 1970). The number of features effects
reported here are independent of these effects. Our word
stimuli were all concrete nouns, and were all
nonpolysemous, differing only in terms of how many
features participants ascribed to those words. Thus, our
results provide support for the claim that it is the “richness”
of a semantic representation that facilitates word
recognition regardless of how that richness is created.
We have argued here that the NOF effects observed in
our LDT and naming experiments (as well as a number of
other semantic effects) support Hino and Lupker’s (1996)
feedback activation account. A key issue to address is to
what extent other models of semantic effects, in particular,
polysemy effects, could explain our NOF effects.

Alternative Explanations
Kawamoto et al. (1994) reported a successful simulation of
polysemy effects in LDT using a model in which it was
assumed that: (a) lexical decision performance is mainly
based on activation of the orthographic units and (b) as a
result of learning with their particular error-correction
algorithm, weights for connections between orthographic
units were enacted differently for polysemous and
nonpolysemous words. Polysemy was captured in the
model by having two different semantic patterns linked to a

single orthographic pattern. This inconsistent orthographicto-semantic mapping created weaker connections between
orthography and semantics. As a result, connections among
orthographic units became more important in producing the
appropriate orthographic activation for polysemous targets.
In contrast, for nonpolysemous targets, semantic activation
played a major role in producing the appropriate level of
orthographic activation.
With respect to NOF effects, however, there would
seem to be no reason why the number of features would
affect the strength of either orthographic-to-semantic
mappings or the connections among orthographic units.
Neither our low nor high NOF words involved any
orthographic-to-semantic inconsistencies. Thus, the model
would have no obvious way to explain a NOF effect.
Borowsky and Masson (1996) successfully simulated
their polysemy effects with a model in which it was
assumed that lexical decisions are made on the basis of the
“familiarity for a letter string’s orthography and meaning”
(p. 76). The model was a Hopfield network, and familiarity
was assumed to be represented by the summed energy
within the orthographic and meaning modules, with this
energy reflecting the extent to which the network had
settled into a basin of attraction. Energy was higher for
polysemous words than for nonpolysemous words, due to
proximity. That is, in the model, all the meaning-level units
were initially set to +1 or –1 in a random fashion. Each unit
was then updated until the network moved into a correct
pattern. The distance (or the number of units to be changed)
from the initial pattern to the correct pattern was
probabilistically smaller when there were two correct
patterns of activation (i.e., for polysemous words) than
when there was only one correct pattern (i.e., for
nonpolysemous words). Thus, the network moved into a
basin of attraction more quickly for polysemous words than
for nonpolysemous words, explaining the polysemy effect
observed in LDT.
With respect to NOF effects, regardless of how many
features a word has, it has only a single correct pattern of
semantic activation. Thus, words with many features would
not benefit from proximity like polysemous words do.
Therefore, as with Kawamoto et al.’s (1994) model, this
model would have no obvious way of explaining NOF
effects.
It is possible that either of these models could be
modified in a way that would allow them to explain NOF
effects in LDT. In neither case, however, would the models
provide as parsimonious an account as that provided by the
feedback activation account. Further, in both cases, new
assumptions would be needed to explain NOF effects in
naming.
The results of the present experiments provide evidence
that LDT and naming performance is faster for words with
rich semantic representations, where richness is defined in
terms of the number of semantic features activated. These
effects suggest that word recognition performance will be
best explained by fully-interactive models involving both
feedforward and feedback activation.
