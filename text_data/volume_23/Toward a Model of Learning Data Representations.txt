relative difficulty of different representations is essentially
reversed in the two tasks. Students had the most trouble in
interpreting stem-and-leaf plots, but that was the only graph
type they had any success in generating. A similar
dissociation of interpretation and generation has been
observed in other domains such as programming (Anderson,
Conrad & Corbett, 1989), although not always (Pennington
& Nicolich, 1991).
Histogram & Scatterplot = Bar Graph

which were correct at least so far as having the proper
surface features, we noted a characteristic error in 100% of
the histograms and 28% of the scatterplots that provides
strong evidence about the students’ problem solving
