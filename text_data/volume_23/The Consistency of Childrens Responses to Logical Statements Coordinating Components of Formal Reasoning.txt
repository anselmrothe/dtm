  a. Responses are coded as being ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ compared to optimal response patterns.
  Correct response patterns are in bold.
  b. Entries indicate the total number of individual response patterns summed over all children’s
  responses in each grade. A total of 28 3rd graders and 33 6th graders were given 8 determinate and
  8 indeterminate statements. Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of responses expected
  from a random response pattern.
