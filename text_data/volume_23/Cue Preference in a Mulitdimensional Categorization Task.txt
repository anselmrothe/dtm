they also learned to do so using only the relevant

the different m ethods used to m odel this step usually

learning of relevant cues in the m ulti-dim ension,m ulticategory task.

R eview ofM odels
Introduction
Categorization has been studied by m any disciplines
including psychology and m achine learning.In the area
of psychology,the psychologicalprocesses underlying
hum an categorization have been investigated. O ne
com m on approach to determ ining these processes has
been to teach hum ans to learn novelcategories based on
very sim ple stim uli that vary along only a few
dim ensions. In such sim ple situations, the com plex
calculations involved in som e of the popular m odels of
categorization (e.g., N osofsky’s (1986) generalized
contextm odel;A shby’s (A shby & G ott,1988;A shby &
Perrin, 1988) decision bound theory) m ay be
psychologically plausible. H ow ever, the results of
these experim ents are then assum ed to be generalizable
to categories w hose m em bers vary along m any
dim ensions. It seem s unreasonable to assum e that
hum ans are capable of the even m ore com plex
calculations required w ith an increase in category
dim ensionality. For exam ple, N osofsky, Palm eri, and
M cK inley (1994) “question the plausibility of exem plar
storage processes and the vast m em ory resources that
they seem to require” (p.53).
M achine learning,on the otherhand,has been prim arily
concerned w ith developing algorithm s based on experts
in specific dom ains (Q uinlan, 1986) -- although the
algorithm s them selves tend to be general-purpose
algorithm s (i.e.,the algorithm s are intended to apply to
any categorization task). These algorithm s have been
developed using large data sets that vary along m any

Exem plar M odels
Exem plar m odels (Brooks,1978; Estes,1986; M edin &
Schaffer, 1978; N osofsky, 1986) assum e that w hen
presented w ith a novel object, hum ans com pute the
sim ilarity betw een that object and all exem plars of
every category in w hich the novel object could be
placed. In theory,the objectis placed into the category
w ith w hich it is m ost sim ilar, how ever m ost exem plar
m odels assum e probability m atching. N osofsky’s
(1986) generalized context m odel (G CM ) allow s for
variation in the am ount of attention given to different
features during categorization (see also M edin &
Schaffer,1978). Therefore,it is possible that different
cues w ill be used in different tasks. H ow ever, this
attention w eight rem ains the sam e for the entire
stim ulus set for each particular categorization task,
ratherthan varying across differentobjects belonging to
the sam e category. G CM uses a probabilistic response
rule based on the Luce-Shepard choice m odel. The
probability of placing stim ulus i into category j is
com puted by sum m ing the sim ilarity betw een stim ulus i
and allobjects in category jalong every dim ension and
then w eighting the sum m ed sim ilarity by the bias to
respond w ith category j. The w eighted sum m ed
sim ilarity is divided by the sum of the w eighted
sum m ed sim ilarity of stim ulus i to each category.
Sim ilarity is usually either an exponential(for separable
stim uli) or gaussian (for integral stim uli) function of
psychologicaldistance (Shepard,1964). Psychological

distance is com puted by the M inkow ski r-m etric w ith
the addition of tw o param eters,c and w k,w here c is the
discrim inability param eterw hich takes into accountthat
stim uli w ill look m ore distinct as experience is gained
and w k is the attention w eightforthe kth dim ension.

D ecision Bound Theory
D ecision Bound Theory (or D BT--see A shby & G ott,
1988) assum es that there is a m ultidim ensional region
associated w ith each category, and therefore, that
categories are separated by bounds. D BT uses a
determ inistic response rule. A n object is categorized
according to the region of perceptualspace in w hich it
lies. The perceptual space is divided into regions by
decision bounds. For tw o categories (A and B) each
com posed of tw o dim ensions (x and y), an object w ill
be placed into category A if the estim ated likelihood
ratio is greater than som e bias, w here the likelihood
ratio refers to the ratio betw een the likelihood that
stim ulus i com es from category A and the likelihood
thatstim ulus icom es from category B. The param eters
of this m odel are b, a response bias; a m ean and
variance for each dim ension (w hich are usually
absorbed into the bound param eters); correlations
betw een pairs of dim ensions; as w ell as param eters to
define the decision bound.
Both of these psychological m odels categorize by
integrating cues and using allthe cues available (except
in exem plar m odels if a cue has an attention w eight of
zero). But the m em ory requirem ents of these m odels
do differ. G CM assum es that all exem plars ever
encountered are stored and used w hen categorizing a
novelobject,w hile D BT only needs to store the bounddeterm ining param eters of each category.
In
com parison, the Categorization by Elim ination
algorithm (described below ) typically requires as little
m em ory as D BT but it does not integrate all available
cues.

C ategorization by Elim ination
Categorization by Elim ination (CBE) w as originally
developed to describe people’s categorization
judgm ents in an anim ate m otion task (see Blythe,
M iller, & Todd, 1996). CBE is closely related to
Tversky’s (1972) Elim ination by A spects m odel of
choice. CBE is a noncom pensatory m odel of
categorization,in thatituses cues in a particular order,
and categorization decisions m ade by earlier cues
cannotbe altered (orcom pensated for)by latercues. In
CBE, cues are ordered and used according to their
probability of success. For the present purpose
probability of success is defined as a m easure of how
accurately a single cue categorizes som e set of stim uli
(i.e., percent correct). This is calculated by running
CBE only using the single cue in question,and seeing

how m any correctcategorizations the algorithm is able
to m ake. (If using the single cue results in CBE being
unable to decide betw een m ultiple categories for a
particular stim ulus, as w ill often be the case, the
algorithm chooses one ofthose categories atrandom--in
this case, probability of success w ill be related to a
cue’sdiscrim inatory pow er.)
CBE assum es that cue values are divided up into bins
(either nom inal or continuous) w hich correspond to
certain categories. To build up the appropriate bin
structures,the relevantcue dim ensions to use m ustbe
determ ined ahead of tim e. A t present, com plete bin
structures are constructed before testing CBE’s
categorization perform ance. Bins can be constructed in
a variety of w ays from the training exam ples by
determ ining low and high cue value boundaries foreach
category on each dim ension. These boundaries are then
used to divide up each dim ension into the cue-value
ranges that form the bins. Thus, CBE only needs to
store tw o values per category per cue dim ension,
independentofthe num berofobjects encountered.

C ategorization w ith M ultiple D im ensions
The m ajority of psychologicalstudies of categorization
have used sim ple artificial stim uli (e.g., sem icircles in
tw o-dim ensionalspace --N osofsky,1986) thatvary on
only a few (tw o to four) dim ensions1. This is in
contrast to the m ore natural high-dim ensionality
m achine learning applications, such as w ine tasting
(A eberhard, Coom ans, & D evel, 1994) or handw riting
recognition (M artin & Pittm an,1991). Itrem ains to be
dem onstrated how optim al hum ans can be w hen
categorizing objects using m any continuously valued
dim ensions. In addition,the predom inantpsychological
m odels of categorization have notaddressed the issue
of how people can categorize a m ultidim ensionalobject
w hen they are constrained by lim ited inform ation.
Berretty and her colleagues (Berretty, Todd, &
M artignon,1999;Berretty,Todd,& Blythe,1997) have
illustrated thatitis possible for a satisficing m odelthat
does notuse allthe available cues to categorize objects,
to perform com parably to integrative m odels on natural
data sets. The purpose of the first experim ent in this
paper is to investigate w hethersuch a satisficing m odel
is able to accountfor hum an categorization data from a
m ulti-dim ensional, m ulti-category task. In Experim ent
1a, hum ans are trained to learn categories that vary
along nine dim ensions.The generalized contextm odel,
categorization by elim ination, and a form of decision
bound theory w illbe tested to determ ine how w elleach
m odelfits the participants’ responses. The purpose of
the second experim entis to determ ine how w ellhum ans

are able to categorize w hen inform ation is lim ited. In
addition, Experim ent 1b investigates the properties of
the dim ensions people preferto use w hen inform ation is
lim ited.

Participants
Four graduate students from the U niversity of
California, Santa Barbara participated in Experim ent 1a
and 1b. A llparticipants had norm alorcorrected vision.
Each participantw aspaid $8 perhour.

M ethod
D esign The design consisted offive differentcategories
that vary along nine dim ensions, w here only three of
the dim ensions are necessary for accurate
categorization. The values for each category w ere
generated from a m ultivariate norm aldistribution w here
variance(dim 1) > variance(dim 3) > variance(dim 2),
w ith the variance for the rem aining 6 dim ensions equal
to the variance along dim ension 3. A lluni-dim ensional
rules that best separate tw o categories w ith the sam e
m ean on the other tw o relevant dim ensions have an
accuracy of 90% (i.e.,category overlap along each pair
ofdim ensions w as setto 10% ).
Procedure Participants w ere told that they w ere to
learn five different categories that w ere equally
represented during each learning session. Participants
w ere instructed thatthey m ay orm ay notneed to use all
the dim ensions available to them . Participants w ere run
over consecutive days untillearning curves leveled off.
Each day consisted of20 blocks w ith 50 trials perblock
(for a total of 1000 trials per day). Stim ulus display
w as response term inated and corrective feedback w as
given afterevery trial. Thus,ifa subjectresponded ‘A ’
to an exem plar from category B, a low tone sounded
follow ed by a ‘B’ appearing on the screen. In addition,
overall percent correct w as given after every learning
block.
A cue preference task (Experim ent 1b) w as
adm inistered to participants the day after learning
ended. The cue preference day began w ith a practice
block in w hich participants sim ply categorized 50
stim ulias they had done on previous days. The practice
block w as follow ed by tw elve blocks, each consisting
of 50 trials. Each trial began w ith the presentation of
one of the three relevantdim ensions. Participants then
m ade a categorization judgm entbased on only thatone
dim ension. A fter m aking a judgm ent, participants
chose another dim ension and then m ade another
categorization judgm ent. Thus, tw o judgm ents w ere
m ade for the sam e stim ulus. The first judgm ent w as
based on only one experim enter-chosen dim ension,
w hile the second judgm ent w as based on tw o
dim ensions. N o feedback w as given during the last
tw elve blocks ofthe testday.

Stim uli and M aterials Stim uli w ere generated using
the G RT Toolbox (A lfonso-Reese,1995). V alues along
every dim ension w ere transform ed from num ber of dots
per square into actual screen coordinates. Each
dim ension w as represented as a texture in one of nine
possible squares on a com puterscreen. The location of
the three relevant dim ensions w as different for each
subjectw ith the constraintthatthe center square (in a
3x3 grid)w illneverbe one ofthe relevantdim ensions.
Stim uliw ere presented on a SuperM ac Technology 17T
ColorD isplay driven by a Pow erM acintosh G 3 running
a Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997) and lowlevel V ideoToolbox (Pelli, 1997) w ithin M A TLA B
(The M athW orks, Inc., 1998). Each participant sat 18
inches from the m onitor. The height of the center
square of the stim uli w as constrained such that visual
angle w as less than 2°.

R esults and D iscussion
Experim ent 1A Learning for three of the four
participants reached asym ptote after five days, w hile
the fourth participantrequired six days. Participants 1,
2,and 3 achieved an overallaccuracy of approxim ately
70% by the last day,w hile Participant 4 only achieved
an overall accuracy of approxim ately 60% on the last
day. The optim al percent correct w as 81.9% .
Participants’responses forthe lastday (w ithoutthe first
block) w ere random ly split into tw o halves (training
and testing sets) five tim es. Each splitw as constrained
to contain approxim ately the sam e num ber of stim uli
from each category.
The Categorization by Elim ination algorithm , the
D eterm inistic G eneralized Context M odel (see A shby
& M addox,1993),and six versions of D ecision Bound
Theory w ere fit to each participant’s training set
responses. For CBE,low and high values of each bin
along each dim ension, as w ell as the cue order, w ere
estim ated from the responses in the training set. The
param eters estim ated for G CM w ere the sensitivity
param eter,an attention w eight for each dim ension,the
bias tow ards each category,and the gam m a param eter
(w hich is a m easure of response selection). Forfitting
the G CM , a Euclidean-G aussian distance-sim ilarity
m etric w asused (see M addox & A shby,1998).
The six versions of D BT w ere all Independent
D ecisions Classifiers, w hich is a special case of
D ecision Bound Theory in w hich each dim ension is
assum ed to be independentofthe otherdim ensions(see
A shby & G ott, 1988; A shby & M addox, 1990). This
version of D BT w as used since the best fitting bound
(to separate the categories) is perpendicular to each of
the three relevant dim ensions. In the versions of the
Independent D ecisions Classifier tested here, one
criterion is placed along one dim ension. Tw o criteria
are then placed along a second dim ension and four
criteria are placed along the third dim ension. A ll

A s m entioned earlier, all three m odels w ere fit to part
of the data set (the training set) and the best fitting
param eters estim ates w ere obtained. These param eters
w ere then used to determ ine the m odels’ accuracy on
the rem aining data (the testing set). A potential
problem w ith m ulti-param eter m odels is that these
m odels m ay be prone to overfitthe data. Thatis,they
actually fit the noise present in the data in order to
achieve high accuracy. Training the m odelon a subset
ofthe data and testing the m odelon the restofthe data
m ay assess a m odel’s “true” perform ance.
The A IC goodness-of-fitstatistic w as used to com pare
the fits ofthe three m odels.

W here lnLI refers to the negative log likelihood value

the closer the m odel is to the “true” m odel (A shby,
1992).

overthe five training and five testing sets)are show n in
Table 1. Each row corresponds to one of the three

m odel w as best able to account for Participant 1’s
training and testing data. Categorization by elim ination
w as bestable to accountforParticipant2,Participant3,
and Participant4’s training and testing data.
Experim ent 1B Experim ent 1b w as designed to answ er
tw o questions. First,how w ellcan hum ans perform in a
categorization task w hen dim ensionality is reduced?
Second, w hat are the properties of the dim ensions
preferred by hum ans? O bviously, one of the m ost
im portant features of a cue is how accurate thatcue is
in categorizing objects w hen used alone. A nother
property ofcues is the range ofvalues possible,thatis,
the variance of a cue. It seem s reasonable to assum e
that hum ans are able to learn the accuracy of various
cues and w ould use those cues thatare m ore accurate.
G iven this assum ption, all three of the relevant
dim ensions are equally accurate w hen used alone.
H ow ever,the question ofw hetherhum ans preferto use
cues w ith m ore or less variance is addressed by having
differentvariances forthe three relevantdim ensions.

In Experim ent 1b (conducted after perform ance
asym ptotes)participants w ere given one dim ension and
asked for a categorization judgm ent.2 Participants then
chose a second dim ension (from the rem aining eight
dimensions) and m ade a categorization judgm entbased
on only those tw o dim ensions.O nly the three relevant
dim ensions for the categorization task w ere used in
Experim ent 1b as the first cue presented to the
participant. Both high and low values of these
dim ensions w ere given to the participants. D im ension
values w ere selected from the categories such thatthe
values w ere alw ays less than (or greater than) the best
fitting criteria values for that dim ension (i.e., only
dim ensional values from nonoverlapping category
regions w ere presented).
The first m ajor result to notice from this experim ent is
the overallpercentcorrectparticipants achieved,w hich
is show n in Table 2. The optim al percent correct
possible w ith only tw o categories is 51.6% .Participant
3 was very close to optim al,w hile Participants 2 and 4
actually perform ed better than w ould be expected. In
addition, Participant 4 actually perform ed better in
Experim ent1b than in Experim ent1a!

The results from Experim ent 1b indicate that
participants did indeed learn w hich of the cues in
Experim ent 1a w ere relevant. A ll four participants
chose (nearly alw ays, if not alw ays) one of the three
relevant dim ensions as their second cue in Experim ent
1b (see Table 3). This indicates thatparticipants w ere
not using any of the other dim ensions during
Experim ent1a3.

Participants w ere given thefirstcueto insurethatallthreeof

This does notrule outthe possibility thatparticipantswere

A ccording to CBE w hen dim ension 1 is presented,
dim ension 3 should be chosen and w hen dim ension 2 or
3 is presented, dim ension 1 should be chosen. W hen
dim ension 1 w as presented firsttw o of the participants
preferred the dim ension w ith the highestprobability of
success (dim ension 3). W hen dim ension 2 w as
presented first, three of the participants preferred the
dim ension w ith the highest probability of success
(dim ension1). A ll four participants preferred the
dim ension w ith the highest probability of success
(dim ension 1)w hen dim ension 3 w aspresented first.
O verall, the participants generally chose the second
dim ension in accord w ith predictionsm ade by CBE.

Learning R elevantC ues
G iven the difficulty of the task in Experim ent 1a, it is
rem arkable that the participants w ere able to learn the
relevant cues. A s show n above, all four participants
chose (nearly alw ays,if not alw ays) the three relevant
dim ensions as their second cue in Experim ent 1b. But
how did cue use progress as the participants learned the
different categories in Experim ent 1a? To answ er this
question three differentversions ofM D S w ere fitto the
participants’ category confusion m atrices from each
half of each day in order to determ ine how m any cues
w ere used by each participantfor a particular data set.
M D S1 uses only one dim ension, M D S2 uses tw o
dim ensions, and M D S3 uses three dim ensions to

accountfor the participants’ confusions. A χ2 analysis
w as perform ed on the differences betw een the fitvalues
for m odels differing in one dim ension. These results
are reported in Table 4.
For participant 1, an M D S choice m odel using tw o
dim ensions did fit the responses better than an M D S
choice m odel using only one dim ension for day 2. By
day 4, an M D S choice m odel using three dim ensions
did obtain a significantly higher fitvalue than an M D S
choice m odelusing only tw o dim ensions. These results
indicate that participant 1 used only one dim ension on
day 1, tw o dim ensions on days 2 and 3, and three
dim ensions on days 4 and 5.4 Sim ilarly, the M D S
analysis indicates that participants 2 and 3 used only
one dim ension on the first half of day 1, tw o
dim ensions on the second half of day 1, and three
dim ensions after day 1. Participant 4 appeared to use
only one dim ension on the first half of day 1, tw o
dim ensions on days 2 and 3,and three dim ensions on
days 4 through 6. Taken w ith the results from
Experim ent 1b, it appears that participants not only
increased over days the num ber of cues used w hen
categorizing, but also learned the correct (or relevant)
cues to use to accurately categorize.
G iven a task consisting of m any dim ensions,itis clear
that participants begin by using only one dim ension.
A dditionaldim ensions are then learned in a sequential
fashion. W hat is rem arkable from these data, is that
participants learned to use all three dim ensions.
D im ension 1 had m ore variance than any of the other
eight dim ensions w hile dim ension 2 had less variance
than any of the other eightdim ensions. Therefore,itis
notsurprising thatparticipants w ere able to learn these
tw o dim ensions (i.e., the tw o dim ensions out of nine
thathad differing variances). D im ension 3 on the other
hand, had the sam e am ount of variance as the six
irrelevant dim ensions, yet participants learned by the
end of the experim ent that this dim ension w as
necessary foraccurate categorization.

C onclusion
In conclusion, the studies reported here show that
hum ans are able to learn artificial m ultidim ensional
categories. It w as also show n that people are able to
distinguish relevant from irrelevant dim ensions in
m ultidim ensional categorization tasks. Results from
such a task indicate thata satisficing m odelis bestable
to accountfor the participants’ responses. In addition,
the predictions m ade by the satisficing m odelregarding
cue preference w ere show n to be in accord w ith the cue
4

protocolcollected atthe end ofthe experim entindicated that
participants w ere only using three dim ensions during
Experim ent1a.

N ote, that on the last half of day 5, the increase in
param eters used by and M D S choice m odel w ith three
dim ensions did notfitthe data significantly betterthan an
M D S choice m odel w ith less param eters (i.e., less
dim ensions).
