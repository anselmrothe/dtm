Abstract
We discuss the effects of collaboratively finding a target
in a simple discovery task, using the Wason’s 2-4-6 task.
We control the following two factors: hypothesis testing
strategies that participants use, and the nature of targets
that they find. First, we propose, through computer
simulations, a hypothesis on a situation in which the
effects emerge. Then we verify the hypothesis by
psychological experiments.
Last, we generalize,
through theoretical analysis, the findings obtained by
the two empirical approaches above. As the result, it
has been concluded that the effects of collaboration
emerge in the following situations: (1) two participants
repeatedly conduct a positive test for finding a general
target, and (2) each of them maintains a different
hypothesis.

Introduction
In psychological studies on scientific discovery,
relatively simple tasks, such as the Wason’s 2-4-6 task
and New Elusis, have been so far used (Gorman, 1992;
Newstead & Evans, 1995). In recent days, using those
tasks, the effects of collaboration have been
empirically discussed when several participants
collaboratively find a target.
We usually think that working together provides
positive effects. However, those empirical results
obtained in the psychological studies above do not
necessarily support the intuitive prediction.
In these studies, the performances (the proportions
of correct findings) in the single condition in which a
single subject performs the task and those in the
collaborative condition in which a group of n subjects
collaboratively performs the task are compared. In this
comparison, even when the latter performance exceeds
the former, the advantage may be introduced not by the
interaction among the subjects, but simply by the
quantity of the subjects. That is, in the latter case n
solutions (final hypotheses) by the n subjects are
considered, and the probability of that at least one of
them is accidentally identical to the target is much
higher than that in the former case. So we should
consider the independent condition in which n
participants independently perform the task without
interaction.
The performance in the independent
condition can be theoretically calculated from the
performance in the single condition. That is, the
probability of that at least one of n subjects reaches the
solution is 1 - (1 - p)n where the probability of each

subject’s finding the correct target is p (0 < p < 1). We
utilize this score as the performance in the independent
condition.
Table 1 reviews the comparison of the
performances in the single, independent, and
collaborative conditions in the preceding studies
(Freedman, 1992; Laughlin & Futoran, 1985; Laughlin
& McGlynn, 1986; Laughlin, VanderStoep, &
Hollingshead, 1991; Laughlin, Bonner, & Altermatt,
1998; Okada & Simon, 1997). Table 1 shows that the
performance in the collaborative condition cannot
exceed that in the independent condition in almost all
cases.
In this study, we will discuss states in which the
effects of collaboration emerge based on the results
above. As an approach, first we will propose a
hypothesis on when the effects of collaboration appear
by computer simulations using a computational model
that solves the Wason’s 2-4-6 task (Wason, 1960).
Then we will verify the hypothesis by psychological
experiments. Last we will generalize the empirical
findings by theoretical task analysis, and discuss why
the effect emerges only in the specific situation.

Fundamental issues
Klayman & Ha, in their paper in 1987, gave some
decisive answers to several historical questions that
had been discussed in the psychological studies using
traditional discovery tasks such as the Wason’s task
(Klayman & Ha, 1987).
One of their major
conclusions was that there was substantial interaction
between the nature of found targets and the
effectiveness of hypothesis testing strategies used by
subjects. So in this study we will control these two
factors in the following experiments.
First, we briefly explain some important concepts
about the two factors: the nature of targets that subjects
should find and the hypothesis testing strategies that
subjects use.
The nature of targets: we categorize targets used in our
experiments from the viewpoint of their generality.
General targets are defined as the targets, the
proportion of whose member (positive instances) to
whole instances in the searched space is large. On the
other hand, specific targets are defined as the targets,
the proportion of whose member is small. For
example, the proportion of the instances fitted to "the
product is even" and "three evens" to all possible

instances are 7/8 and 1/8 respectively. So the former is
an example of a general target and the latter is an
example of a specific target.
Hypothesis testing strategies: There are two types of
hypothesis testing: a positive test and a negative test.
The positive test (Ptest) is conducted by an instance
subjects expect to be a target. That is, Ptest is
hypothesis testing using a positive instance for the
hypothesis; the negative test (Ntest) is hypothesis
testing using a negative instance. For example, when a
hypothesis is "ascending numbers", hypothesis testing,
using an instance, "1, 3, 9", is Ptest; hypothesis testing,
using "1, 5, 2", is Ntest.
In the following description, for avoiding the
confusion of the basic concepts, we define Yes and No
instances as members and non-members (positive and
negative instances) for targets that subjects do not
know. On the other hand, we also define Positive and
Negative instances as members and non-members for
hypotheses that subjects form.

Klayman et. al. summarized the states when a
subject’s hypothesis was disconfirmed.
Figure 1
illustrates those states in the example situation of that
the target is "three evens" and the subject’s hypothesis
is "ascending numbers". When the subject conducts
Ptest, using an instance, "1, 3, 5", and receives No
feedback, his/her hypothesis is disconfirmed. Another
state of disconfirmation is introduced by the
combination of Ntest and Yes feedback, using an
instance, "8, 6, 2". On the other hand, the states of
confirmation are introduced by the combination of
Ptest and Yes feedback, using "4, 6, 8", and the
combination of Ntest and No feedback, using "5, 3, 1".

Computer simulations

advantages of collaboration appear by computer
simulations.

In the following, we will explain only the summary
of our model. Detailed specifications of the model can
be seen in our other papers (Miwa, 1999).
The model was constructed on the interactive
production system architecture that we had developed
for simulating collaborative problem solving processes.
The architecture primarily consists of five parts;
production sets of System A, production sets of
System B, the working memory of System A, the
working memory of System B, and a common shared
blackboard.
Two systems interact through the
common blackboard. That is, each system writes
elements of its working memory on the blackboard and
the other system can read them from the blackboard.
The model has knowledge on the regularities of
three numerals. The knowledge is organized as the
dimension-value lists.
For example, "continuous

evens", "three evens", and "the first numeral is even"
are example values of a dimension, "Even-Odd". The
dimensions the model uses are: Even-Odd, Order,
Interval, Range of digits, Certain digit, Mathematical
relationship, Multiples, Divisors, Sum, Product, and
Different.
Basically the model searches the hypothesis space
randomly in order to generate hypotheses. However,
three hypotheses, "three continuous evens", "the
interval is 2", and "three evens" are particular. Human
subjects tend to generate these hypotheses at first when
the initial instance, "2, 4, 6", is presented. So our
model also generates these hypotheses first prior to
other possible hypotheses.
As for a way of hypothesis verification, the
principle on when a model’s hypothesis is
disconfirmed and a next hypothesis is reconstructed is
based on the Klayman & Ha’s schema shown in the
previous section.

The design of simulations
In our computer simulations, we let the two
systems find 35 kinds of targets. Examples of the
targets are: three continuous evens, ascending numbers,
the interval is 2, single digits, the second numeral is 4,
first numeral times second numeral minus 2 equals
third numeral, multiples of 2, divisors of 24, the sum is
a multiple of 12, the product is 48, and three different
numbers. The initial instance was "2, 4, 6". For each
target, we executed 30 simulations to calculate the
percentage of correct solutions.
The computer simulations were conducted based
on the following 2 * 3 experimental design.
The nature of targets: We divided the 35 targets into
two categories: (a) 17 specific targets and (b) 18
general targets.
Hypothesis testing strategies: Three combinations of
hypothesis testing strategies were investigated. They

were (a) Ptest and Ptest, (b) Ntest and Ntest, and (c)
Ptest and Ntest.

Results of the simulations
Figure 2 shows the results of the computer
simulations. The horizontal axis of the figure indicates
the number of experiments, that is, the number of
generated instances whereas the vertical axis indicates
the proportion of correctly finding the 17 specific
targets and the 18 general targets.
In Figure 2, the performances in the independent
condition and those in the collaborative condition are
compared. In the independent condition, we regard
that the targets are correctly found when at least one of
the two systems, each of which independently tries to
find the targets without interaction, reaches the correct
solution.
In the collaborative condition, experiments are
alternately conducted. Through each simulation, one
system generates the half of whole instances; and the
other half is generated by the other system. Each
experimental result is shared by both two systems, that
is, each system knows whole generated instances with
Yes or No feedback that is given to each instance.
In addition, the collaborative condition is
subdivided into the following two sub-conditions. In
one sub-condition, each system simply alternately
conducts experiments, not referring to another
hypothesis that the other system forms. In this subcondition, two systems share only the experimental
space. In the other sub-condition, one system tries to
form a different hypothesis, referring to another
hypothesis of the other system. In the latter subcondition, two systems share the hypothesis space in
addition to the experimental space (Klahr &Dunber,
1988).
In the figure, the results of statistical analysis are
also indicated. The upper row indicates the difference

between the performances in the independent condition
and those in the collaborative condition where two
systems try to form different hypotheses, whereas the
lower row indicates the difference between the
performances in the independent condition and those
in the collaborative condition where each system does
not refer another hypothesis of the other system. The
asterisks show the advantage of the independent
condition whereas the sharps show the advantage of
the collaborative condition.
Three levels of
significance are used: ### (or ***) for p < .01, ## (or
**) for p < .05, and # (or *) for < .1. No significance
is indicated with n.s.
Figure 2 indicates that the performance in the
collaborative condition exceeds that in the independent
condition only when (1) both systems use the Ptest
strategy for finding general targets, and (2) both
systems try to form different hypotheses, sharing their
hypothesis space. In the other cases, the effect of
collaboration is not remarkable.

The order of the problems was counter-balanced.
Twenty-four trials (experiments) were permitted for
finding each target.
The experimental design is
summarized in Table 2.
In the following discussion, we exclude the results
of the subjects who did not follow the experimental
instruction requiring to use each hypothesis testing
strategy. Table 2 shows the number of subjects (or
pairs) assigned to each experimental condition, and, in
parenthesis, the number of them who correctly follow
the Ptest and Ntest instruction.

Design and procedure

Results of the experiments

A total of 136 subjects participated in the
experiments. Each of them was assigned to each of the
following five experimental conditions: (1) the single
Ptest condition where a single participant solved a task
using Ptest, (2) the single Ntest condition, (3) the
collaborative Ptest and Ptest condition where two
participants, both of whom were required to use Ptest,
collaboratively solved a task, (4) the collaborative
Ntest and Ntest condition, and (5) the collaborative
Ptest and Ntest condition. Each subject solved two
problems. In one problem, "three evens", as a specific
target, was discovered. In the other problem, "three

(f)). Additionally the performances in the independent
condition are calculated from the performances in the
single condition by using the similar procedure
indicated in the introduction (independent conditions
in (a) and (f)).
As for statistical analysis, the upper row indicates
the difference between the performances in the single
condition and those in the collaborative condition,
whereas the lower row indicates the difference
between the performances in the independent condition
and those in the collaborative condition.
The statistical analysis shows, in every
combination of the hypothesis testing strategies, that
the performances in the collaborative condition cannot
exceed those in the independent condition. However,
only in the combination of Ptest and Ptest for finding
the general target, the performance in the collaborative
condition exceeds that in the single condition, and a
tendency of the advantage of the collaborative
condition over the independent condition is observed
even though the statistical analysis does not indicate
the significant difference.
Next, to confirm the effect of two subjects’ forming
different hypotheses, we will conduct the following
additional analysis. First, we divide the subjects in
each collaborative condition into two groups: the
subjects who found the correct target earlier and those
who did later. The latter group includes those who did
not find correct target. Then we measure the average
of the proportion of that the subjects in each group

maintained different hypotheses through the trials till
reaching the solution. Figure 4 shows the result. What
we note is that the effect of forming different
hypotheses appears in the combination of Ptest and
Ptest, especially when finding the general target,
whereas this effect does not appear in the combination
of Ntest and Ntest. These results are consistent with
the findings of the computer simulations.

Theoretical analysis
Why does the advantage of collaboration emerge only
when both participants, for finding the general targets,
repeatedly conduct Ptest? We will discuss the reason
based on the Klayman & Ha’s framework of analysis.
Klayman et. al. indicated, by their mathematical
analysis, that Ptest was an effective heuristic for
finding specific targets; on the other hand, Ntest was
effective for finding general targets.
When a target is general, the possibility of
receiving Yes feedback is high in the experiments. In
the situation, it is difficult that Ptest introduces
disconfirmation because the combination of Ptest and
Yes feedback introduces confirmation. So Ptest often
prevents subjects from finding general targets. In
addition, Ntest is an ineffective strategy for finding
specific targets because subjects very often receive No
feedback as a result of their Ntest. The collaboration
of two systems can compensate for these week points
of hypothesis testing strategies.
Let us consider the collaborative condition in
which both two systems (or two subjects), System A
and System B, alternately conduct Ptest, and the
systems have different hypotheses. In this situation, it
happens that a positive instance for a hypothesis of
System A, HA, corresponds to a negative instance for
another hypothesis of System B, HB. For example,
when a hypothesis HA is "the interval is 2" and a
hypothesis HB is "ascending numbers", an instance, "2,

0, -2", is this kind of instance (see Figure 5).
When System A conducts Ptest, using this instance,
it happens that for System B Ntest is introduced by the
instance generated by System A. As a result, Yes
feedback introduces disconfirmation of the hypothesis
HB because the combination of Ntest for HB and Yes
feedback is carried.
This brings the effect of
collaboration when two systems, both of which use
Ptest, find general targets.
An important point is that this function emerges in
the interaction between two systems. This advantage
is not introduced as the effect of the quantity of the
systems. That is, the advantage is not the effect of that
the number of systems in the collaborative condition is
twice as many as that in the single condition. As you
can confirm in Figure 5, when each system
independently conducts Ptest, a hypothesis of each
system is never disconfirmed. Chances of hypothesis
disconfirmation can be introduced only through the
collaboration of two systems.
A next question is why this kind of effect does not
appear in the combination of Ntest and Ntest when
finding specific targets where the probability of
subjects’ receiving No feedback is very high.
If the above-mentioned type of interaction between
two systems emerges in the combination of Ntest and
Ntest, the situation in which Ntest of System A
introduces Ptest for System B should happen.
However, generally speaking, members (positive
instances) of a hypothesis is much fewer than the nonmembers (negative instances). So the possibility of
constructing the situation in which Ntest of one system
accidentally introduces Ptest for the other system,
where the effect of the Ntest and Ntest collaboration
appears, is much lower than the possibility of
constructing the situation in which Ptest of one system
introduces Ntest for the other system, where the effect
of the Ptest and Ptest collaboration appears. This is the
reason why only the combination of Ptest and Ptest
introduces the effect of collaboration.

Conclusions
In the introduction of this paper, we indicated that the
effects of collaboration rarely appeared in the
psychological experiments, using orthodox simple
discovery tasks.
We empirically demonstrated a
situation in which those effects of collaboration
emerged, and theoretically discussed why the effects
were introduced. Concretely, we indicated that the
effects appeared when both subjects (systems) verified
their hypotheses by using Ptest for finding general
targets. This result is more interesting, as a finding on
collaborative discovery, when we note that humans
have a cognitive bias of tending to use Ptest more
frequently.

Our empirical findings and theoretical discussions
conclude that (1) generally speaking, simply solving a
problem together rarely introduces the effects of
collaboration, (2) to introduce the effects of
collaboration, it is needed that the interaction between
collaborative systems brings new abilities, such as a
function for introducing disconfirmation of their
hypotheses, which are not involved in each individual
system, and (3) the possibility of bringing those
abilities depends on natures of objects that systems
investigate, strategies and heuristics that systems use,
and the relation between these factors.
