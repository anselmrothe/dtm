                      Introduction
In a well-known study Meltzoff (1988, 1999)
demonstrated that 14-month-olds are already capable of
delayed imitation of a novel goal-directed action.
Infants observed a salient novel action performed by an
adult model on a black box with a translucent orange
plastic panel for a top surface. The box had a light bulb
hidden in it. The model leaned forward from the waist
and touched the panel with his/her forehead as a result
of which the box was illuminated. The infants were
given the box only on a separate visit a week later when              Figure 1: Touching the box with the forehead
67% of them imitated the salient novel action: they

Results
To test our hypothesis that the different situational
constraints on action in the two conditions influence the
likelihood of the target action being imitated, we first
compared the relative amount of imitated ‘head-on-box’
target acts in the two conditions. As Figure 2 shows, the              Figure 3a: Pointing to the model
two conditions differed significantly in this respect (
Chi-square = 6.238 (df=1) p<.013). In the ‘Hands free’
condition 75% of the infants imitated the modelled
‘head-on-lamp’ action replicating Meltzoff’s original
result (he found 67% imitation). In contrast, when the
model’s hands were occupied (‘Hands occupied’
condition), only 27% of infants imitated the target act.
The rest of the infants tried to light the lamp by
touching it with their hands only.
   Furthermore, there was a clear indication that the
majority of infants who did not imitate the target act in
the ‘Hands occupied’ condition did not fail to do so
because they forgot the target act after the one week                  Figure 3b: Touching with hand
