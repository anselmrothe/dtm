                       Appendix
We suppose that the observer matches two vectors at
each trial of the experiment: a stimulus vector of
dimensionality k and a template vector ß of the same
dimensionality representing the memorized pattern to
match against the input (e.g., the letter ‘S’ or a smiling
face).
    Suppose further that we arrange the n stimuli of the
experiment in the n * k matrix X. The behavior of the
observer for the whole experiment is described by
                        y = ßX+ε,
where y is an n-dimensional vector of decision
responses, and ε is an n-dimensional vector of "error"
random variables with E(ε) = 0 and V(ε) = σ2I.
    For simplicity, the “target present” and “target
absent” responses in y as well as the white and black
pixels in X are encoded with values of 1 and –1,
respectively.
    Given that we know X and can observe y, we can
resolve the linear system of equations by finding ß.
The least square solution requires that we minimize the
scalar sum of squares
                    S = (y-Xß)’(y-Xß)
for variations in ß. Differentiating, we have
                      2X’(y-Xß) = 0,
which gives, for our least square estimator, the vector
                      ß = (X’X)-1X’y.
This is the logic of standard multiple regression (e.g.,
Sprent, 1969). Because our stimulus vectors are
uncorrelated, we have
                   (X’X)-1 = (kI)-1 = k-1I,
Therefore,
                        ß = k-1X’y.
Leaving the constant k aside, this equation reduces to
summing all stimuli that led to a ’yes’ response and
subtracting from it the sum of all the stimuli that led to
a ’no’ responses. This is the essence of reverse
correlation.
