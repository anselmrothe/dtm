Experim ent 2 show ed that w hen dealing w ith
conditional instructions, people have a m uch clearer
understanding of those relations than w hat could have
been expected from their usual perform ance in
conditionalreasoning tasks.
   Taken together, these tw o studies suggest that
speakers’ perception of the felicity of differentkinds of
conditionalexpressions is strongly determ ined by goal-
structure (avoid m iss vs. avoid false alarm ), and that
hearer’s reactions to these conditionals is w ell aligned
w ith this goal-structure,even ifhearers have no explicit
know ledge of these goals.The results therefore suggest
that the function of these different form ulations of
conditional instructions is to direct the hearer’s
attention to aspects ofhis decision-m aking situation that
the speaker considers im portant. That hearers so
successfully detect the speaker’s intentions not only
suggests – in the language of A ustin – high
illocutionary uptake,butalso successfulcoordination of
action by the speakerand the hearer.
   For the rational speaker to get w hat he w ants done
w ith w ords, he should therefore choose a form of the
conditional that encodes the goal-structure im plicit in
the context, in the know ledge that the hearer should
reactin a w ay thatw illfulfillhis intention.Rationality
here is thus social and pragm atic, determ ined by the
successfulcoordination ofthe speakerand the hearerto
achieve shared organizationalgoals.
