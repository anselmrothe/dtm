   The model consisted of two sets of 10 input nodes
representing the individual items and two input nodes
representing the set identifiers. The 22 input nodes were
fully connected to the 10 output memory nodes, initially
with random weights (0..1). Each node had an
associated trace activity, Tr, which was dependent on
the node’s Tr at the previous time step and the node’s
current activity, Act: Tr(time+1) = (1-δ)Trtime+δAct. The
trace activity time constant δ was set at 0.5, with similar
results obtained for δ=0.2 to δ=0.8. Weights between
input i and memory node j were set randomly (0…1)
with updating (learning) based on the trace activity,
∆Wt[i,j] = α(Acti – Wt[i,j])Tracej. The weight change rate,
α, was 0.01 (similar results were obtained for α=0.001
to α=0.2). The (Acti – Wt[i,j]) ensures that the weights
are bounded (-1..1). Initial training consisted of setting   Figure 2: Modelling retrieval-induced forgetting. The
