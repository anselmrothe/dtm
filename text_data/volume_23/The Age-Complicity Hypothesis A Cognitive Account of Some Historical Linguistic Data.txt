Abstract
Shillcock, Kirby, McDonald and Brew demonstrate
that there is a significant global relationship between
word form and meaning across a substantial part of the
lexicon of English. Here, 1705 words were studied to
establish how their history in the language related to
their participation in the correlation between meaning
and form. It was found that the meaning-form
correlation was significantly stronger for words with
earlier dates of entry into the lexicon, implying that an
individual word’s meaning-form correlation may
develop over time. Changes to individual words may
be contingent on the word meanings and word forms
in the rest of the lexicon.

Introduction
What is the relationship between a word’s form and
its meaning? And does age matter to the closeness of
a relationship?
This paper addresses the second of these questions
by building on previous work which addresses the
first. The rest of this section introduces general
background to the first question; the next section
introduces the specific work upon which we build,
and our current hypothesis; subsequent sections
outline the methods and results of the current study,
and draw a general conclusion.
Kelly (1995) suggested that “the hypothesis that
phonological cues are unavailable or that people are
not sensitive to them have no ‘sound’ basis in fact”.
On the one hand, the interaction between phonological and semantic representations has been widely
discussed. On the other, the seemingly intuitive idea
that there is a structure-preserving relation between
these two aspects of words’ representations has been
largely ignored.

For instance, Dorffner and Harris (1997) report a
model predicting that “although the mapping between
word form and meaning is arbitrary… novel pseudowords will prime concepts corresponding to words
that are orthographically similar”. They go on to
discuss findings that showed that when English
speakers are presented with pseudo-words, they tend
to have associations with English words similar in
terms of form. However, Dorffner and Harris dismiss
possible relations between orthographic and semantic
representations, and this implies that they see no
connection between phonological form and the
meaning of words. Yet no strong evidence is put
forward to support this claim. Whereas priming
effects could certainly exist in the absence of
meaning-form relations, there is no reason to suggest
that useful phonological cues to meaning cannot be
utilised.
Indeed, Kelly (1992) had previously investigated
how phonological cues—in terms of number of
syllables, word duration, and pronunciation of certain
syllables—were involved in category assignment.
The study indicated that phonetic cues could be used
to infer gender in a number of different languages,
including French, Hebrew and Russian.
Continuing from this work, Cassidy, Kelly and
Sharoni (in press) studied how phonological cues can
be used to interpret gender, and how this information
might be used by English speakers. A connectionist
model was trained to classify novel names as male or
female, solely on the basis of phonological cues, and
succeeded in classifying 80% of names correctly.
Experiments were undertaken which showed that
four-year-old children had the ability to infer gender
from pseudo-names, and that names that are
phonologically typical of either gender are classified
significantly more quickly than less typical examples.

In addition, Kelly (1998) studied “blend structure”,
which concerns the manner in which aspects of two
words can be combined to produce a fresh word, in
terms of cognitive and linguistic principles. Clearly,
such cases help enhance the relationship between
meaning and form for the words involved. Blended
words such as brunch may become embedded in the
lexicon due to their phonological evocativeness.

The Relationship Between
Meaning and Form
Shillcock, Kirby, McDonald and Brew (2001) report
a study in which they generated a semantic
hyperspace from a large corpus of English,
effectively defining the meaning of each word in
terms of its contexts of occurrence. The semantic
distance between any two words could be quantified
using this hyperspace. In addition, they defined the
phonological distance between any two words in
terms of an edit distance (the number of features that
it would be necessary to change to turn one word in
the other).
For a set of 1733 monosyllabic, monomorphemic
words, they obtained the meaning distance and the
form distance between each word and every other
word. They demonstrated that there was, overall, a
significant relationship between these two distances:
words that are phonologically more similar tend to be
semantically more similar.
Further, for each word they calculated the
correlation between the two pairs of distances
between that word and each of the remaining 1732
words. This gave a value of rmf (the correlation
between meaning and form) for each word. When
these individual values were ranked, important
psychological differences between words emerged
between different parts of the ranking. A high value
for rmf can be seen as the rest of the lexicon
conspiring to support the relation between meaning
and form for that particular word. Shillcock et al.
claim that the communicatively important words
predominantly occurred at the top of the list. In
contrast, words with a small or negative rmf value are
often more specific and “propositional”, for example,
priest or plight. Shillcock et al. postulated that this
relation is an example of a tendency towards
structure-preserving mappings by the brain.
This ranked list of the relation between words’
meaning and form provides the basis for the current
study.
With reference to studies on the role of phonology
and similarities between lexical neighbours, Shillcock
et al. suggested that even very different words can be
related in “a model that assumes the whole lexicon
may influence the processing of any one word”. They

go on to demonstrate how the variability of
monomorphemic, monosyllabic words in terms of
length and phonological similarity can relate to
semantic meanings, due to a tendency whose results
resemble the compositionality normally present only
at the higher levels of linguistic structure.

The Age-Complicity Hypothesis
Suppose the meaning-form correlation is, as
hypothesised, a quantifiable aspect of a representational strategy employed by the brain. Then we can
suggest that the correlation for each word is open to
change over time, as groups of phonetically similar
and semantically similar words become established.
Further to this effect, it is also likely that words with
strong individual meaning-form correlations are more
likely to remain established, whereas words with
weak individual meaning-form relations could be
subject to semantic drift, and would be more likely to
take on new meanings, losing their original ones.
Therefore, the meaning-form correlation would tend
to be strongest for words that have been longest in the
lexicon. We call this prediction the Age-Complicity
Hypothesis.

Method
The current study was based on the list of 1733 words
ranked according to their individual relationship
between meaning and form (rmf), produced by
Shillcock et al. Using information obtained from the
Oxford English Dictionary on the first non-obsolete
date of entry, a total of 1705 of these words were
analysed, once words with no dictionary entry had
been discarded. This produced a database of 1705
words with information on first non-obsolete date of
entry and rmf scores.
Correlation between rmf rank and date of first entry
was measured using Kendall’s Tau B. The data were
further analysed by comparing how the rmf correlation
differs within sections of the ranked list partitioned in
terms of rmf rank and age.

Results and Discussion
The Age-Complicity hypothesis predicted that words
with long established meanings would have high rmf
values. This prediction was convincingly supported
by these results. Figure 1 gives an overall view of the
data, but although certain interesting features are
visible, it is not possible to discern the trends in the
data. Figure 2 charts averaged data, and trends
become visible.
As Table 1 shows, there was a highly significant
correlation (τ = 0.08, p < .001) between the meaningform relation and the first date of entry over all the
data.

On the basis of rmf rank, the data were divided into
three sections for further analysis: the top ranked 500
words, the middle ranked 500 words and the lowest
ranked 500 words. The correlations between first date
of entry and rmf are given in Table 1.
There was a negative correlation for the top 500
words in the ranking: the words that were higher in
the ranking by rmf had the more recent dates of entry
for this subset, contrary to the overall correlation.
This feature of the results is probably a reporting
phenomenon. The very top of the ranking by rmf
contains a number of items such as speech editing
terms (um, er), swear words, and shortened proper
names (Mick). These kinds of items may have been
relatively unlikely to be written down—and hence
given a date of first entry—in earlier times.
The middle section showed a non-significant
correlation between rank order of rmf value and date
of first entry, although this time with a positive
correlation. Finally, the lowest entries showed a
correlation between rank and first date of entry which
mirrored that in the total survey. In summary, despite
the anomaly at the top of the ranked list, the results
displayed an overall pattern of words’ individual
meaning-form relationships correlating with age, with
words with a high value of rmf having an earlier date
of entry.

What happens when we think primarily in terms of
dates? To provide another view onto the hypothesis,
the data were again split into three sections, this time
according to dates of entry. The three sections
correspond to dates of entry between the years 601
and 897, 972 and 1297, 1303 and 1911, respectively.
Table 2 shows a non-significant (but negative)
correlation between rmf rank and date of entry for the
section of words with the earliest dates of entry. The
positive overall correlation is best reflected in the
“middle-aged” words.
We have just seen, in Table 1, the reversal of the
correlation for the more recent words, and the same
explanation applies to Table 2. A good example is the
new entry yeah (a colloquial form first recorded in
1905) with a very high rmf value (ranked 8th). If this is
due to a reporting phenomenon, then yeah could
have been important in speech for a long time, and
simply not captured in text, to be reported by the
OED. On the other hand, it remains possible that yeah
is just a recent, successful innovation. Then, the entry
into the language of such a modified word could be
attributed to their meaning-form correlation being
stronger than their competitor, (yes is ranked 89th in
terms of rmf). Figure 3 charts the averaged data.

Finally, we have shown that it is possible to
construe some of the data about language change
from historical linguistics in cognitive terms, and
specifically in terms of an adaptive relationship
between meaning and form in the mental lexicon.

Conclusion
From the results, it seems that there are anomalies
amongst the (apparently) youngest, and oldest
recorded words in our study. Nonetheless, a moderate
interpretation of the Age-Complicity hypothesis has
real support: the closeness of the relationship between
form and meaning is related to its age.
More specifically, this study has produced evidence
of a relationship between the history of an individual
word in the language and that word’s participation in
the overall relationship between meaning and form in
the lexicon. If a word has a high value of rmf, then it
may be that it resists any change in its own meaningform relationship; the rest of the lexicon is in effect
supporting that relationship. Such a meaning-form
relationship is adaptive; it means that the form and
the meaning of the word can be partly inferred, one
from the other—a clear advantage in language
acquisition and processing. At the same time, that
individual word may be helping to change the form
and/or the meaning of words with weaker values of
rmf.
These findings have implications for studies of a
number of aspects of human language. Principally,
they offer data to substantiate an explanation of why
some words become established in the lexicon while
others do not. In other words, one of the contributing
factors which can help a word become established is
“sounding right”, i.e. that its form resembles that of
words with similar meanings.
We suggest that computational modelling might be
used to simulate the data we have presented. It is not
possible to obtain sufficient historical data to resolve
all the possible reporting biases that may be present
in data of the kind we have considered.
Computational modelling may help to resolve some
of these issues.
