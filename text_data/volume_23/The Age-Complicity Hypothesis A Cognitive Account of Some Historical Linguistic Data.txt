supporting that relationship. Such a meaning-form
relationship is adaptive; it means that the form and
the meaning of the word can be partly inferred, one
from the other—a clear advantage in language
acquisition and processing. At the same time, that
individual word may be helping to change the form
and/or the meaning of words with weaker values of
rmf.
   These findings have implications for studies of a
number of aspects of human language. Principally,
they offer data to substantiate an explanation of why
some words become established in the lexicon while
others do not. In other words, one of the contributing
factors which can help a word become established is
“sounding right”, i.e. that its form resembles that of
words with similar meanings.
   We suggest that computational modelling might be
used to simulate the data we have presented. It is not
possible to obtain sufficient historical data to resolve
all the possible reporting biases that may be present
in data of the kind we have considered.
Computational modelling may help to resolve some
of these issues.
