was to determine whether it is easier to detect violations

showing still frames of a person playing paper, scissors,

forming legal gestures (Rock, Scissors, Paper), and six         580

pictures of a sequence always showed a closed fist

violations were faster detected than context violations
right from start. Hence, it seems that analyzing the
order of a sequence is completed before the meaning of
an action is fully processed. An alternative explanation
for the different speed with which violations of order
and context can be detected is perceptual saliency.

because a wrong hand position is perceptually more
salient than a hand forming a different gesture.

perceptual saliency of order and context violations was
more comparable. The deep structure of the action
sequence, five alternations of the same gesture and
formation of the target gesture with the last alternation,
did not change. However, the alternations were now
expressed as hand turnings instead of arm movements
(see Figure 4). Hence both, violations of order and
context now depended on the configuration of hand and
fingers. Violation of order consisted in a missing turn of    Figure 5: Examples for violation of order (left: wrong

The general pattern of results suggests that in action
comprehension the analysis of order and meaning
proceeds in parallel. Moreover, both processes seem to
be highly automatic, that is, none of the two aspects of
action sequences can be easily ignored. A further result
is that analyzing the order of a sequence might be
completed before its meaning is fully analyzed.
However, further experiments are needed to determine
