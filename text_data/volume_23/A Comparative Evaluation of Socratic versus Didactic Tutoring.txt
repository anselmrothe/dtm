larly, McKendree (1990) found that feedback messages

messages with low content. Finally, it is reported in
(Graesser et al., 1995) that ordinary human tutors seldom
use Socratic tutoring, and yet are quite effective.
   The results of our formal comparison presented here
demonstrate a trend in favor of Socratic style tutoring
over Didactic style tutoring.
                 Experimental Setup
The context of our work is a web-based course on basic
electricity and electronics (BE&E). The system was de-
veloped with the VIVIDS authoring tool (Munro, 1994)
at the Navy Personnel Research and Development Cen-
ter in San Diego, CA. The original BE&E tutor was de-
signed as a tool for classroom instruction. As we are in-
terested in one-on-one tutoring, we observed how stu-
dents interacted with the system and with a human tutor
in a Wizard-of-Oz setup. The curriculum used in our ex-
periments and prototype system consists of four lessons
and six labs covering basic concepts of current, voltage,
resistance, power, making measurements with a multi-
meter, and doing some simple computations and prob-
lem solving. Each lesson consists of three sections of be-
tween 10 and 25 pages of instructional text and graph-
ical illustrations displayed in a Netscape window, as in
Figure 1. After each section, the student was tested with                   Figure 1: Netscape Window

Tutor:            So now let’s think about the switch.                  Is it a source or a load?
Student:          source
Tutor:            Why do you say that?
Student:          when it is turned off, no energy flows
Tutor:            OK, that is true. But does it actually cause electricity to flow?
                  Or is it merely letting what current was produced by the source
                  flow through it to the rest of the circuit?
Student:          it does not create energy
Tutor:            Good.      So it is not a source.            Would you say it is a load then?
Student:          no
Tutor:            Good, it is neither a source nor a load. So does it have a
                  difference in charge between its two ends?
Student:          no
Tutor:            Very good.        So then can you measure voltage across a switch?
Student:          no
Tutor:            Right. So how can you modify the way you have the leads hooked up
                  now so that there will be a difference in charge between where the
                  two leads are hooked up?
Student:          since i know there is a third place to hook them up, is it possible
                  to connect the one to the negative side of the battery and connect
                  the other to the positive of the light bulb?
Tutor:            Yes, that would be perfect.                Go ahead and do that.

Tutor:                 Do you remember in the lesson that it said that every point on a

Student:               yes.
Tutor:                 Good. That means that there is no difference in potential energy
                       between one point on the conductor and another point. So, if both
                       leads are attached to the same conductor, there is no difference
                       in potential (in other words, no difference in charge) and thus no
