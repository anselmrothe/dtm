      First, we found that both people waiting for the
train and people actually riding on the train were more
likely to take the ego-moving perspective (63%) than
the time-moving perspective (37%), χ2=13.9, p<.01.
Interestingly, the data from people waiting for the train
didn’t look any different from those of people actually
on the train (61% and 64% ego-moving response
respectively), suggesting that it is not the experience of
spatial motion per se, but rather thinking about spatial
motion that underlies our representation of time.
      We then examined people’s responses based on how
long they had been waiting for the train (see Figure 4).

correlated -- movements that are longer spatially are also
likely to take a longer amount of time. These simple
correspondences in experience can then be amplified and
built on by language. People often use metaphors from
more experienced-based domains to talk about more
abstract domains, and often these metaphors go beyond
what can be observed in experience. This means that
some abstract knowledge might be constructed and
shaped by language. In fact, this turns out to be the
case. For example, English and Mandarin speakers use
different spatial metaphors to talk about time, and this
difference in language leads to important differences in
the way the two groups think about time (Boroditsky,
in press). It follows that to properly characterize
abstract thought, it will be important to look not only
at what comes from innate wiring and physical
experience, but also at the ways in which languages and
cultures have allowed us to go beyond these to make us
smart and sophisticated as are.
