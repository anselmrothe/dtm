communicate conceptual and linguistic structure that may be
difficult varies between people in general, but may also be as-
sociated with cognitive processing variance between people.
For example, aphasic patients have been shown to have diffi-
culty with sequential processing (Joanette & Brownell, 1990).
The possible connection between sequential processing and
the ability to reason about explanations which precede a sit-
uation and predictions which follow can then be presented.
If linguistic structures are ill-formed, this may simply be ev-

may be that underlying processes associated with reasoning

Differences in cognitive processing may exist between cre-
ative reasoning and logical deductive reasoning. Considering
differences in linguistic production and evidence of cognition
in studies of right and left hemisphere brain damage, com-
paring attention to and attempts at expressing these different
reasoning types may give insight into a representational dif-

   There are many triggers in this scene, of which the ones
illustrated above are examples. These triggers are conducive
to observers expressing reasoning of situations prior to this
picture, which is explanation, and what may happen as a re-
sult of this picture, which is prediction. To avoid confusing
creative explanations and the more logical deductive predic-
tions with other evidence of reasoning, we also separated out
categorization. Categorization was the default label of ev-
idence of reasoning regarding naming, description of states
and current events, and descriptions of emotional states or
theory of mind. This provides a category specific to evidence
of reasoning not directly associated with making explanations
or predictions from the picture stimuli, and also lets us keep
track of other linguistic evidence of reasoning as a whole.            Figure 4: Percentage distribution of explanation, categoriza-
