at the base of the bell, many fine tentacles extend outwards.
When small planktonic creatures touch these, they are killed
by independently acting stinging cells (nematocysts) and
carried to the margin by tentacle flexions (Mackie et al,
2003). Subsequently the manubrium, say the mouth, bends
toward the prey and engulfs it (ibid.).
   Taken as an agent, Aglantha does not amount to very
much. Disregarding its feeding behavior and other
intricacies, Aglantha does two things, swimming slowly to
feed and, when touched, escaping by a fast swim. Dennett in

as a Darwinian creature (1996, p.110), situated at the
