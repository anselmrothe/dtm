   The second variable is the number of players, which can
be 2 or 3 or 5. The purpose of this manipulation is to change
the rational expectation of the responder. For example, if the
total amount is $10 and the number of players is 5, the
rational expectation would be $2.
   The third variable is the amount of proposal. In the gain
framing condition, it would be the offer the responder would
get if he/she accepts. In the loss framing condition, it would
be the share of cost the responder would have to pay if
he/she accepts. The amount can be $0, $1, $2, $3, ..., $10.
   A within-subject 2(gain or loss) x 3 (# of players) x 11

condition is balanced among subjects. In each framing task,
subjects perform each trial condition twice, resulting in a
total of 66 trials. They are presented in a completely random
order. Subjects respond using a mouse, clicking left button
for acceptance and right button for rejection. The EEG data
is collected using the 128-channel EGI system with Net

experiment.
