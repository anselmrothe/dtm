    We tracked participants’ eye movements as they
performed a referential communication task with two
speakers. During the task, speakers produced certain 'test
instructions' in which they referred to an old referent for
which a precedent had been established. The experiment
involved three independent variables: (1) the variable of
speaker, corresponding to whether the speaker producing
the test instruction was the same as (Old), or different from
(New), the speaker who originally established the precedent;
(2) precedent, which was whether the precedent that was
established was consistent with (Maintain) or inconsistent
with (Break) the test instruction; and (3) cognitive load (No
Load versus Load).

Results and Discussion
   If speaker (common ground) and precedent (history of
usage) effects are independent, then they should be
distinguishable in the time-course of processing. They also
might be affected in a different manner by cognitive load.
We tested these predictions by examine the proportion of
looks to the Unmentioned object in the displays, across
seven different time windows starting from the onset of the
referring expression plus 180ms (time necessary to program
an eye movement, Matin, Shao & Boff, 1993). The idea that
broken precedents depend on common ground predicts that
a new expression inconsistent with an established precedent
should be mapped onto the unmentioned object differently
when the speaker is old than when the speaker is new.
Specifically, if precedent and speaker effects are dependent,
listeners should look to the unmentioned object more in the
case where an old speaker breaks a precedent than when a
new speaker, with whom there is no precedent established,
uses a new expression to refer to the already-mentioned
target.
   As Figure 2 top panel shows for the case of No Load, this
speaker effect in the Break condition appears in the fourth
time window (900-1200 ms), well after the effect of
precedent, which starts in the second window and is carried
over the next five windows. This shows that the effect of
precedent (whether or not the expression has been used
before or not) is prior to the effect of speaker: they have
different onsets. Interestingly, this effect of speaker is not
present in the same fourth window in the Load condition
(bottom panel), in which appears only an effect of
precedent. A three-way within-factor Anova by subjects                   Figure 2: Proportion of fixations to the unmentioned objects
