will refer to this piece of knowledge as the “Activation

the machine to activate. Without this understanding, the
backwards blocking data are not ambiguous: if the detector
is not deterministic in the backwards blocking procedure, it
is more likely that object B is a blicket than the base rate.
When A and B are on the detector together, it is possible
that A, which is a blicket, failed to activate it, giving B the
