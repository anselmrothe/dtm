   We focus on two questions related to the learning of
temporal dynamics: (1) what information do people utilize
to make decisions in a dynamic situation, and how the
utilization of information change with experience, and (2)
what are the major differences in terms of strategies or
processes when we compare learning behavior between a
static and a dynamic situation. To preview our results, we
found that people tended to ignore the temporal dynamics
initially, and as a consequence failed to utilize information
that indirectly influenced the outcome of their decisions. In
addition, we found that future planning was essential to
anticipate changes as well as outcomes of actions in
dynamic systems, and it often took a significant amount of
experience for people to learn to engage in future planning.
