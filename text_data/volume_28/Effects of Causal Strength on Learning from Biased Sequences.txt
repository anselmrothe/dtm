simulated learning curves were qualitatively similar, though
with minor differences due to variations in parameter
values. These simulated individuals have no noise in their
responses; their ratings exactly correspond to their current
beliefs. To better approximate realistic behavior, we did
1000 runs in which we applied Gaussian noise (mean=0,
sd=5) to the ratings for each individual.
   We classified these 35,000 (noisy) learning trajectories
using the above method. The classification profile (in
thousands) is given in Table 3. The simulation classification
finds more Associationist behavior in the -/+ sequences than
in the +/- sequences, just as in the empirical classification.
Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that there are a non-
trivial number of associationist experimental participants. At
the same time, there are notable differences between the two
classifications, particularly many fewer Indeterminate                       Figure 2: Mean changes in Strong – half-sequence
individuals in the simulation classification (especially for
Weak -/+). Thus, we suspect that we have a mixed
population of causal learners (see also Lober & Shanks,
2000). Unfortunately, we do not know of any proposed
computational theories of step-by-step model-based
learning, and so we cannot produce a complementary set of
simulated model-based learners.

Comparisons of Belief Change Patterns. Our final set of
analyses focused on a previously unexplored feature of this
type of data. By design, for each bias, the first half of the +/-
sequence is the same as the second half of the corresponding
-/+ sequence (and vice versa). Thus, participants see the
exact same sequence of 20 cases twice: once as the first half
of a sequence, and once as the second half. We can therefore
analyze order effects on learning by comparing directly the
changes in their ratings when presented with the same
sequence of cases in different settings (either the start or the
midpoint of a sequence). Any significant differences
between the changes that participants made on some
particular case are presumably due to order effects.
