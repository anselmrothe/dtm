hypothesis formation and testing. This assumption is
supported by the high error rate of the aware group when
compared with the unaware group: the error rate of the
aware group was about 5 times higher than the unaware
group in the grammatical blocks, and was still 3 times
higher during the violation block. Lambert & Roser (2001)
report a similar lack of a violation effect in semi-aware
participants.
   Experiment 1 provides evidence for implicit learning of a
connection between articles and thematic roles. The form-
meaning connections were learned even though the relevant
meanings were derived from the context, rather than the
lexical representations of the nouns. This result is perhaps
rather surprising in the light of the general assumption that
