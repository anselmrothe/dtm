prediction is then compared with the actual
presence/absence of the effect. The difference between the
predicted and actual states of the effect (the prediction error)
forms the basis of learning. BUCKLE predicts the effect
according to equation 5:
      e predicted = P(e) = (o • qo ) + (u • qu ) − [(o • qo ) • (u • qu )] (5)
   In this expression, o=1 or 0 (when the observed cause is
present or absent, respectively) and u=P(u| o, e). This
expression (as well as Equations 1-4) assumes that causes
combine in the manner of a noisy-OR gate (e.g., Cheng,
1997; Danks, Tenenbaum, & Griffiths, 2003; Griffiths &
Tenenbaum, 2005).
