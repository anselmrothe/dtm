   Therefore, according to Equations 6 to 9, PSC at short and                           experimental results of the percentage change of fMRI signal:

if Ti, Capi, λi,, k, M, s, b, a, and t at these conditions are given.
For the same brain regions measured by the same fMRI
techniques, s, k, M, a, Ti, Capi, and b are expected to be
remained the same in short and long SOA conditions.
Furthermore, since the length of each trial is fixed either at
short or long SOA conditions, the value of t also remains the
same in short and long SOA conditions. During each trial, the
same amount of information through t arrived at the cognitive
system; therefore, λi remains the same in short and long SOA
conditions. Therefore, according to Equations 6-9 above, for
the same brain region, the expected percentage signal change
of CB(t) keeps constant across different SOA conditions, i.e.:
∴ CB(t )long = CB(t )short
Q PSClong - PSCshort
   CB (t )long − CB (t 0) CB (t ) short − CB (t 0) CB (t )long − CB( t ) short
=                        −[                       ]=
         CB (t 0)                CB (t 0)                  CB (t 0)
∴ PSClong - PSCshort = 0
   In other words, in this queuing process, since the amount of
information processed by each brain region remains the same
in the short and long SOA conditions, the integrated BOLD
signal remains the same in the short and long SOA
conditions.
               Modeling Results and Validation
   Using the equations derived in the previous sections, the
predicted results of both reaction time and percentage change
of fMRI signal are presented and validated with the target
experiment results. The value of parameters of these
equations is set based on a classic cognitive modeling study
(Byrne & Anderson, 2001) (see Appendix).
Reaction Time

experimental results in reaction time: the R square of the
model is .8 and the RMS=35.0 ms.
