Repeatability
An important requirement for a kinetological system is the
ability to represent actions exactly in the same way even
facing inter-personal or intra-personal variability. A
kinetological system is repeatable when the same symbolic

until the most frequent pair in the current grammar has less

of the grammar is reached.
       The highest level of the grammar contains the lexical
units of HAL. The sub-string alphabets embed the structure
that allows the identification of roots, prefixes, and suffixes
in the lexical units. Furthermore, this structure implies                                                Fig. 9: Coordinative segments for the jog action.
