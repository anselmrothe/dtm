(e.g., many roads show strong linear perspective), expansion
describes the space of the environment independently of its
affordances.
Depth: What volume does the scene subtend? Is it a close-
up shot from 1 meter away, or is it a panorama where one
can see for miles? A scene may have large volume

properties.
Results
          There was strong agreement among participants for
global property rankings: between-observer Spearman’s
rank-correlations ranged from 0.6 (movement) to 0.83
(openness), and were all statistically significant (p <.01).
This indicates that participants ranked the same images in
very similar ways, suggesting that these properties
correspond to objective interpretations of the image.
          The mean magnitude rank for each semantic
category along the seven global properties is shown in
Figure 2. Interestingly, we observed that the distribution of
global property magnitudes provide a unique description of
each basic-level category. Some categories such as lake or
mountain have equal weights for all global properties,
whereas other categories such as desert, waterfall, and
forest have properties that are clearly diagnostic (shown by
high and low peaks). The set of magnitudes represents the
average exemplar of a given category: for instance, a desert
is a very hot and open environment, with low degree of
movement and camouflage; waterfall and river have a high
degree of movement (due to rushing water); forests are
closed environment with a high potentiality for camouflage.
          The results suggest that the global properties
constitute a conceptual signature of the meaning of a
specific basic-level natural category and suggest the               Figure 2: Mean magnitude of each global property, for each

Method
          Thirty-two observers, with normal or corrected to
normal vision, participated in Experiment 2 (11 males, mean
age 22.4). Participants were given the name of a category
and asked to answer as quickly and as accurately as possible
whether the briefly presented full-color picture (30 msec
duration followed by a 1/f noise mask) belonged to the
target category. The procedure consisted of a full confusion
matrix of experimental blocks, where each target category
was compared to distractor sets with particularly “high” or
“low” magnitudes on one of the seven global properties,
yielding 112 conditions (8 target categories * 7 global
properties * 2 magnitudes). For instance, if “forest” was the
selected target category, pictures of forests would be
categorized among distractors from images from a variety of
semantic categories but who shared a particular global
property magnitude, such as “high movement”. Each
individual completed at least 8 blocks that were
diagonalized such that no participant saw the same
distractor set twice. Each experimental block was composed
of 25 target images and 25 distractor images and
participants were told to answer as quickly and as accurately
as possible whether the briefly presented scenes belonged to
the target category by pressing a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ key. Finally,
each of the 112 experimental blocks was completed by six
meta-subjects.
Results
          As expected, human hit performances on all
categories was high: ranging from 0.72 for oceans to 0.90
for forest and 0.94 for waterfalls.

Results
          The ideal observer’s categorization performance

in the behavioral experiment (r=0.90, p=0.0002, Figure 4).
Error analysis
          Does the ideal observer make the same kinds of
errors that human observers do? There was a significant
correlation between the number of false alarms made to an
image by human observers and failure of the ideal observer
(r=0.66, p=0.001). Furthermore, the nature of the errors was     Figure 4: Ideal observer categorization performance (hits) is

images well-classified by both human and the model. Some
images are not well classified by either (Figure 5b), and
seem to correspond to less prototypical instances of the

Diagnosticity of global properties for model
          The ideal observer shows that these seven global
properties are sufficient to predict human performance in a
rapid scene categorization task. However, it does not
indicate whether all of the properties are necessary for
categorization. To test, we compared the confusion matrix
of human categorizations to runs of the ideal observer
model that was trained without a particular global property.
Both of these "knock-out" a global property for use in
categorization: for the humans, as the distractor set had a
uniform distribution for this global property, it cannot
inform categorization. In other words, assuming movement         Figure 5: A (bold titles) corresponds to the correct responses
