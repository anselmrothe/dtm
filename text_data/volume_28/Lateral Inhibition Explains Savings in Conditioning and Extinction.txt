cognitive modeling framework (O’Reilly and Munakata,
2000) offers a collection of integrated formalisms that
are grounded in known properties of cortical circuits but
are sufficiently abstract to support the simulation of be-
havior. The framework has been used to model a broad
range of cognitive processes, including aspects of percep-

includes dendritic integration using a point-neuron ap-
proximation, a firing rate model of neural coding, bidi-
rectional excitation between cortical regions, fast feed-
forward and feedback inhibition, and synaptic plasticity
that incorporates both error-driven and Hebbian learn-
