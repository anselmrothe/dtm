deciding to cooperate (which is actually the union of the
trustworthy and untrustworthy possibilities). In other words,
the probability of the disjunction can fall below the
probability of a component event, which is a violation of the
OR rule within classic probability theory. Has such a
violation ever been empirically observed?

Abstract
A new approach to game theory based on quantum strategies
is used to explain some paradoxical phenomena of human
choice behavior. Quantum strategies were originally used to
explain the fact that humans prefer to cooperate rather than
defect in a Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) game. Here we develop
a quantum model for the disjunction effect. This refers to a
paradox in which (a) a player prefers to defect when the
player knows that an opponent will defect, and (b) the player
also prefers to defect when the player knows that an opponent
will cooperate, but (c) the player reverses preference and
cooperates when the opponent’s action is unknown. New
experimental findings on the disjunction effect are reported,
and a quantum explanation for the findings is presented. The
quantum model is also compared to traditional information
processing models.

Disjunction Effects
Consider a PD game in which there are two players, you
versus other, and each player has two actions: cooperate or
compete. An example payoff matrix for each player,
conditioned on each pair of actions, is shown in Table 1.

Quantum Information Processing
Human reasoning and decision making involves a great deal
of vagueness, uncertainty, and conflict. How best to model
these characteristics is a fundamental question for
information processing theories of cognition. In this paper,
we examine a quantum computing approach to this problem
(see Nielsen & Chuang, 2000).
Consider for example, the decision whether to cooperate
or compete with another business on some high tech
venture. For example, this other business may have some
technical skills that are needed for success. Suppose this
decision also depends on whether the other business is
trustworthy or untrustworthy. According to a quantum
approach, prior to expressing a decision, the decision maker
is in a superposition state in which all of the combinations
of beliefs about trustworthiness and preferences about
cooperation have some potential to be observed. This idea
alone is not terribly interesting because any classic
information processing theory could also adopt a similar
representation. What is interesting is the uniquely quantum
idea that possibilities can interfere with each other as if they
exist simultaneously in the mental state. In particular,
according to quantum theory, the joint probability of
believing the other business is trustworthy and deciding to
cooperate can be greater than the marginal probability of

In the standard version of the game, hereafter referred to
as the unknown condition, the players simultaneously select
an action without knowledge of the opponent’s selection.
Two new manipulations are used to examine the disjunction
effect: In one case, you are initially informed that the other
player has chosen to compete; and in another case, you are
initially informed that the other player has chosen to
cooperate. This manipulation is designed to test the ‘sure
thing’ principle that lies at the foundation of utility theory
(Savage, 1954): If you prefer to compete knowing that your
opponent will compete and you prefer to compete knowing
that your opponent will cooperate, then you should prefer to
compete even when you do not know your opponents
choice.
Shafir and Tversky (1992) found that players frequently
violated the sure thing principle – many players chose to
compete knowing that the other player competed, and they
also chose to compete knowing that the other player chose
to cooperate, but they cooperated when they did not know
the choice of the other player. See Croson (1999) and Li
and Taplan (2002) for replications and extensions.
The disjunction effect also rules out a simple yet
important information processing model for this task.

from these replications are not as convincing as the original
results, as they reveal only minor violations of the
predictions of the simple ‘two state’ model.

Suppose that during the unknown condition, there are two
possible states of thought that you can entertain about your
opponent. There is some probability p of thinking ‘the other
will compete’ and there is some complementary probability
(1−p) of thinking ‘the other will cooperate.’ There are also
two actions that you can take, compete or cooperate,
conditioned on your state of belief. Accordingly, the
probability that you choose to compete should equal the
weighted average: p·Pr[you compete | other competes] +
(1−p)·Pr[you compete | other cooperates]. This average can
never fall outside the range defined by the two extreme
probabilities of Pr[you compete | other competes] and
Pr[you compete | other cooperates]. However, Shafir and
Tversky (1992) reported a competition rate equal to 63% for
the unknown state, which fell below the range defined by
the two known states: 97% when the other player was
known to compete, and 84% when the other player was
known to cooperate. This finding contradicts the ‘two state’
information processing model.
One can save the information processing model by
assuming the existence of three mental states: one is a
‘known to compete’ state, another is a ‘known to cooperate’
state, and a third is a ‘confused’ state that is entered when
the opponent’s action is unknown. Perhaps you tend to
randomly guess more whenever you enter the ‘confused’
state. This could lower the probability of competing during
the unknown condition down toward chance (50%), falling
below either of the known conditions.
Although the ‘three state’ model can lower the rate under
the ‘confused’ state toward chance, it cannot lower the rate
systematically below chance. Contrary to this prediction,
Tversky and Shafir (1992) found a systematic reduction far
below chance using a gambling paradigm to study the
disjunction effect. In this experiment, you are presented
with two possible plays of a gamble that is equally likely to
win $200 or lose $100. You are instructed that the first play
has completed, and now you are faced with the possibility
of another play. Tversky and Shafir (1992) found that 69%
chose to play again after a known win, 59% chose to play
again after a known loss, but only 36% chose to play when
the outcome of the first play was unknown. The ‘three state’
model cannot explain the fact that gambling rate dropped far
below the chance rate of 50% during the unknown
condition.

Therefore we decided to conduct another replication. But
this time, we conducted a new extension in which humans
played against computer agents and the humans were
truthfully informed. The instructions were almost identical
to those used by Shafir and Tversky (1992), except that
participants (Ps) were informed that they would be playing
against computer agents on a computer network instead of
against other humans. Ps were simply told that they would
occasionally see bonus trials that would inform them of the
agent’s decision prior to making their own.
Our Ps were 88 graduate and undergraduate students at
Indiana University who participated for monetary rewards;
eligible students also received one credit toward their
introductory psychology experimental requirement. We
offered a minimum of five dollars, but Ps could earn up to
twenty dollars depending on the outcome of their decisions.
Our sample consisted of an approximately equal number of
males and females (42 and 46, respectively). All Ps were
recruited via e-mail from a database of students who had
indicated that they would like to be involved in paid
experiments.
Each P played 40 games on a computer, 18 of which were
PD games similar to that shown in Table 1, and the other
games were fillers (not analyzed). All Ps saw PD games on
the same trial numbers. Six different PD matrices were
used, and each PD matrix was only allowed three
presentations. In this manner, all Ps were assured of seeing
each of the six PD matrices once in each condition. The
exact orders of the PD matrices, however, were determined
in a quasi-random fashion. The program always showed the
standard form of a matrix the first time that matrix appeared,
and then it randomly chose between cooperating and
competing the second time (while displaying, of course, the
corresponding notification). The third time a matrix was
presented, the program chose to compete if it had
cooperated the second time or to cooperate if it had
competed the second time. In sum, there were six PD
matrices and each appeared three times for each of the
eighty-eight Ps; we therefore had 528 triads on which to run
analyses (a triad consisted of the three cases of each matrix).

New Experiment
To our knowledge, there have been only two replications
and extensions of the disjunction effect, and both used the
PD game (Croson, 1999; Li & Taplan, 2002). The original
study by Tversky and Shafir (1992) and the replication by
Li and Taplan (2002) involved deception -- each human
actually played against a computer agent. The replication by
Croson (1999) used humans playing against humans. The
results from the original study and the two replications are
compared in Table 2 below.1 As can be seen, the results

The results for Croson were averaged across the symmetric and
asymmetric PD game conditions.

Our results are posted in Table 2 in the row labeled
Matthew.
The effect of each condition on individual competition
rates was first analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA.
Gender was also analyzed, but there was no significant
effect. Even after correcting for a slight violation of
sphericity, it was clear that the conditions led to significant
differences between the rates, F(1.761, 153.223) = 50.070,
p<0.001. This provided the clearance to perform protected
paired t-tests. The first such t-test, between the unknown
condition and the known-competition condition, produced a
significant result, t(87) = -9.082, p<0.001. Next, we
compared the unknown condition to the known-cooperation
condition and again found significance, t(87) = -6.278,
p<0.001. Finally, the known-competition and knowncooperation conditions were compared, and significance
was again observed, t(87) = 3.485, p<0.001.

another operator is applied that transforms the initial state
into one that has ψDD = ψDC = 0 to produce ψC =
[0,0,αC,βC], where βC2 = 1 − αC2. In the unknown case, an
operator is applied which produces a superposition state ψU
= √½ · ψD + √½ · ψC. The interpretation of this state will be
treated in the discussion.
To select a strategy, the player must evaluate the payoffs
of the actions. Thus the state ψ is processed by a quantum
operator Ut for some period of time t which transforms the
previous state into a final state ϕ = Ut · ψ = [ϕDD, ϕDC, ϕCD,
ϕCC]. Finally, the observed probability of choosing to defect
is given by |ϕDD|2 +|ϕCD|2.
The quantum strategy Ut can be constructed from a
Hamiltonian matrix H as follows: Ut = exp(−i·t·H). (This
uses a complex matrix exponential function, which is
available in MatLab or Mathematica). Here i = √-1 and this
factor is required to guarantee that Ut is unitary. The
processing time parameter, t, is a free parameter in the
model, but it can be manipulated by deadline pressure.
In general, the Hamiltonian H must be Hermitian (H = H†)
to guarantee that Ut is unitary. For this application, the
Hamiltonian is a 4 × 4 matrix with elements hij = hji*.
We use the simplest possible Hamiltonian that can explain
the results: h11 = h33 = µ, and h41 = h14 = -1, where µ is a free
parameter. The parameter µ depends on the payoff
advantages for defecting as compared to cooperating. This is
designed to build up probability amplitude for the defect
actions, |DD〉 and |CD〉. Setting h41 = h14 = -1 allows transfer
of probability amplitude between the correlated states |DD〉
and |CC〉. This is designed to coordinate beliefs and actions.
In sum, the model has 4 parameters: αD and αC are used to
determine the initial states depending on knowledge of the
opponents play, and t and µ are used to construct the
quantum strategy for taking action. For example, if we set
αD = 1, αC = .7853, t = .5291, µ = 5.3060, then the model
produces the probabilities shown in the bottom row of Table
2, which accurately reproduces the findings of the present
study (compare to the row labeled Matthew in Table 2).
Alternatively, if we set αD = 1, αC = .4061, t = .8614, µ =
2.3479, then the model predicts .69, .59, .36, which
perfectly reproduces the Tversky and Shafir (1992)
gambling results (here we associate the defect strategy with
choosing to play the gamble).

Quantum Strategies
To construct a quantum model for this task, we postulate
that there are two states of beliefs about your opponents
action, defect versus cooperate. Additionally, there are two
states of action for you to take, again defect (which
corresponds to competing but allows clearer notation in the
coming equations) versus cooperate. We assume that a
person can simultaneously consider beliefs and actions
which then produces four basis states denoted {|DD〉, |DC〉,
|CD〉, |CC〉}. For example, |DC〉 represents the case where
you simultaneously believe that the opponent will defect but
you intend to act cooperatively.
The state of the cognitive system (that is, the part needed
for modeling this task) is represented by a quantum state
vector. In this case, the state is represented by a 4 × 1
column vector ψ = [ψDD, ψDC, ψCD, ψCC]. According to
quantum theory, the state vector is a probability amplitude
distribution across the basis states. For example, ψDC
represents the probability amplitude of the quantum system
being observed in state |DC〉. The probability of observing
this state is |ψDC|2. The state vector must be unit length to
guarantee that the state probabilities sum to unity. 2
The state of the cognitive system is changed by thoughts
generated from information in the environment. In terms of
the quantum model, a thought is represented by a quantum
operator, denoted U, which changes the state from one
vector ψ to another ϕ = U⋅ψ. For this application, the
quantum operator is represented by a 4 × 4 unitary matrix U
with the property U†U = I, where I is the identity matrix.
The matrix U must be unitary in order to preserve the unit
length property of the state vector.
The initial state vector represents the state of the cognitive
system at the beginning of each trial. This initial state is
changed by information given to the P. If the player is
informed that the opponent will defect, then an operator is
applied to transform the initial state into one that has ψCD =
ψCC = 0 producing ψD = [αD,βD,0,0], where βD2 = 1 − αD2. If
the player is informed that the opponent will cooperate, then

Interference Effects
So, how does the quantum model produce this disjunction
effect? Recall that the ‘two state’ information processing
model fails because it must predict that the defection rate for
the unknown condition is an average of the rates for the two
known conditions. The quantum model violates this
property because interference effects occur under the
unknown condition.
Define M as a matrix with the first row equal to [1 0 0 0]
and the second row equal to [0 0 1 0]. The product φ = M ⋅ ϕ
produces a 2 × 1 vector that represents the projection of the
quantum state onto the bases that lead one to choose to
defect. The squared length, |φ|2 = φ†φ = |ϕDD|2 +|ϕCD|2, gives
the probability of defection.
If the opponent is known to defect, then we obtain φD†φD =
(MϕD)†(MϕD) = (MUtψD)†(MUtψD), and if the opponent is

computing principles.
133

known to cooperate, then we obtain φC†φC = (MϕC)†(MϕC) =
(MUtψC)†(MUtψC). During the unknown condition, we
obtain φU†φU = (MϕU)†(MϕU) = (MUtψU)†(MUtψU) =
[MUt(ψD+ψC)]†[MUt(ψD+ψC)] /2 = (φD + φC)†(φD + φC)/2 =
(φD†φD + φC†φC)/2 + φD†φC.
The latter term φD†φC is called the interference term. If it is
zero, then the quantum model reduces to the traditional ‘two
state’ information processing model, and consequently it
fails to account for the disjunction effect. However, if the
interference term is negative, then it can reduce the
defection rate during the unknown condition below the rates
for the known condition. In sum, the superposition state that
is generated by the unknown information condition is
required to produce the interference effect. But it is not
sufficient.
Why is the interference term negative for this quantum
model? This is generated by the coordinating link h14 = h41 =
−1 in the Hamiltonian, which is used to generate the
quantum strategy Ut. This causes the states of the quantum
system to become entangled. If this link was turned off, by
setting h14 = h41 = 0, then the interference effect disappears.
This is true even when the unknown condition produces a
superposition state. In conclusion, the combination of
superposition and entanglement are required to explain the
disjunction effect.

before the measurement of state X, the system was not
exactly located at any particular belief state; instead all
belief states coexisted in parallel. For example, a person
may have a tendency to believe simultaneously that a
defendant is surely guilty and surely not guilty, and this is
not the same as believing the defendant is moderately guilty.
How can the quantum model account for the disjunction
effect? Shafir and Tversky (1992) offered a possible
explanation that may be analogous to entanglement: quasimagical thinking. Suppose Ps consider that their opponent
is engaged in a thought process much like their own (this
may apply to the computer agents, also - see Nass & Moon,
2000). No matter what option the Ps consider, they may
feel that their like-minded opponents will also consider the
same. Because mutual cooperation is more rewarding than
mutual competition, Ps are motivated to cooperate so long
as they can also reason that their opponents will do the
same. Cooperation is only to be preferred however, when
mutual cooperation is compared to mutual competition, and
Shafir and Tversky point out that the tendency to cooperate
should decline when this comparison is no longer relevant
(e.g., when mutual competition is impossible because the
opponent has already cooperated).
The superposition native to the quantum model is due to
the uncertainty over which state is actually relevant during
deliberations. Shafir and Tversky state that people may be
reluctant to regard probabilistic events as fact and therefore
do not explore the resulting paths sufficiently. We offer the
view that people have no problem considering probabilistic
events as fact but do hesitate to discard their logical
opposites under conditions of uncertainty. That is, our Ps
may have been perfectly fine believing that their opponents
would compete but did not see this as inconsistent with the
belief that the opponent would cooperate. We liken this to
the familiar state of dreaming in that what goes by
unquestioned in our dreams (when everything, so to speak,
is superposed) may often present as markedly impossible
upon conscious contemplation.
How does processing in quantum systems relate to
processing in production rule models or connectionist
networks? Similar to production rule models, quantum
operators can be programmed to perform sequences of
transformations of if-then type using what are called
controlled U gates (see Nielsen & Chuang, 2000). Similar to
connectionist networks, quantum operators function as
content addressable parallel processors that map fuzzy
distributed inputs into fuzzy distributed outputs.
What is the neural basis for quantum states and quantum
operations? Quantum dynamics are based on wave
equations that may provide a good mathematical foundation
for modeling brain waves (see Pribram, 1993). Interference
effects may be produced by interactions among brain waves.
Finally, are there any other applications of quantum
models in cognitive science? Eisert, Wilkens, and
Lewenstein (1999, see also Piotrowski & Sladkowski, 2003)
opened up a new approach to game theory by introducing
quantum principles for selecting mixed or probabilistic
strategies. When quantum strategies are permitted, the
paradox of the PD game disappears, and cooperation rather
than defection emerges as an equilibrium strategy. Bordely

Quantum States and Quantum Strategies
This paper accomplishes two goals. One is to report the
results for a new experiment that successfully replicated and
extended previous empirical findings concerning the
disjunction effect using a PD game. The second is to
provide an explanation for the disjunction effect derived
from quantum game theory. Our theoretical analyses
demonstrate the sufficiency of the quantum model for
reproducing the disjunction effect. The ‘two state’ and
‘three state’ information processing models fail to do this.
We do not have enough data to test the quantum model
rigorously at this point. New experiments that include new
conditions are being designed for this purpose.
What else can the quantum model predict about the
disjunction effect? There are three factors that we can
manipulate and use to generate new predictions from the
quantum model. One is information about the likelihoods of
the opponent’s actions, which should affect the
superposition state. A second is the payoff matrix of the
game, which should affect the Hamiltonian. The third is
deadline time pressure, which should affect the processing
time parameter. These new manipulations can be used to
provide more stringent tests of the model.
What does it mean to be in a superposition state?
Consider, for example, belief states. According to a
traditional information processing account, the cognitive
system may jump from one belief state to another (e.g.,
jump from one subjective probability to another), but at any
given moment, the system is definitely in one particular
state of belief. In other words, if we observe the state at
some particular moment and find it to be equal to state X,
then the system must have been in state X, immediately
before we took this measurement. According to quantum
theory, this concept of state is entirely wrong! Immediately
