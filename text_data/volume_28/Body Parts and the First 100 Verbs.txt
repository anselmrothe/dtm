Abstract

about their own actions rather than when they were about
the actions of others. In brief, if children’s own real time
and physical actions are a source of emerging meanings, one
might expect early verb meanings to be related to these
physical actions and also to the body parts that execute
them.
Recent behavioral and neuro-imaging studies of adults also
suggest a close link between verb meanings and bodily
actions. Performing an opposing action (e.g., pulling with
one’s hands when the verb is push) interferes with word
recognition (e.g., Glenberg, Gutierrez, Levin, Japuntich, &
Kaschak, 2004). Further in functional MRI studies,
presentation of a verb has been shown to activate the
specific motor areas involved in producing the action
labeled by that verb (e.g., Hauk , Johnsrude & Pulvermuller,
2004). These adult verb meanings seem likely to have their
developmental origins in children’s sensori-motor
interactions in the world and thus also point to the value of
studying the relation between early verbs and body parts.
Finally, evidence from a variety of cross-linguistic studies
suggests the utility of looking to body parts as organizers of
semantic systems. Across the world’s languages, body parts
play a significant role in organizing concepts of number,
space, measurement and emotion (deLeon, 1994; Saxe,
1981; Yu, 2004). The idea that bodily interactions organize
verb semantics is also a centerpiece of cognitive linguistics
(Talmy 1988; Clark, 1976). Accordingly, the present
research sought preliminary evidence on the role of body
parts in the semantic organization of a corpus of common
verbs, the verbs normatively learned first by speakers of
English.

This paper reports a computational analysis of the semantic
structure of the first 103 verbs typically learned by young
speakers of English, relative to their relation to body parts.
The results suggest that early verbs are strongly related to
body parts, and tend to be organized to just four main body
regions: mouth, eyes, legs, hands. The results also suggest
that similarities among verbs in associated body parts may
influence children’s acquisitions of those verbs. The results
fit with growing behavioral and neuro-imaging results on the
role of the body – and sensory-motor interactions in the world
– in verb meanings.
Keywords: developmental psychology, language acquisition,
verb semantics, statistics.

What, if anything, does the morphology of the body have to
do with word meanings? Common verbs –kissing, hugging,
putting, holding – are very much about bodily interactions
with the world. It seems likely that as young children learn
these words they are often engaged in the labeled action –
kissing or being kissed, for example – actions that saliently
involving specific body parts such as the lips. This paper
presents new evidence concerning the role of body parts in
organizing early-learned verbs.

Body parts as a basis for verb meaning
Verbs are often considered to be the relational center of
sentences and their semantics –and their acquisition – is
often studied in terms of their relations to other words (e.g.,
Gentner, 1992; Gleitman, 1990). However, as L. Bloom
(1972) has noted, children learn and use words because they
are relevant to their own goals, desires and actions. From
this perspective, early verb meanings might be expected to
be embedded in the child’s physical actions in the world,
rather than merely in relations among words. Consistent
with this idea are many studies suggesting early verb use is
oftent in relation to the child’s wants and actions (Braine,
1976; Huttenlocher, 1974; Tomasello, 1992). For example,
in one Huttenlocher (1974) found that children both
comprehended and produced words more when they were

Specific Goals
The research examined the first 103 verbs that typically
comprise the first verbs acquired by speakers of English.
The study was designed to answer four questions:
(1) Do English adult speakers consistently associate
specific body parts with these common verbs ?
(2) Are only a few or many of these verbs systematically
related to particular body parts?

555

(3) Can these verbs be organized in a semantic space well
structured by body parts?
(4) Is the order of acquisition of these verbs related to body
parts involved in the referred-to action?

offer; they were free to supply any body part, at any level of
scale - e.g., fingernails, fingers, hands, arms, whole body.

Analyses
From these judgments, we created a body-part vector for
each verb. This vector represents the number of adult
judgers who listed each body part as associated with the
verb. Nested body parts (e.g., lip, mouth, head) were treated
separately. For example, the “meaning” vector for bite has
these values within it: 29 mouth, 19 teeth, 1 head, and 1 lip
as these are the numbers of the 50 adults who gave each one
body part when given the word bite.

Answering these questions is a first step to determining how
verb meanings may be grounded in bodily action.

Method
The potential relevance of body parts to individual verbs
was measured by providing adults with a list of verbs and
asking them to supply one body part associated with each
verb. The participants were not told the reasoning behind
the task and they were not asked for the body part associated
with action; instead participants were free to supply
whatever body part popped into their heads for whatever
reason. Our rationale in the use of this task is this: If early
verbs are associated with bodily actions done by particular
body parts - and this is shared knowledge by mature
speakers of the language - then adults should (1)
systematically associate specific body parts with specific
verbs and (2) they should agree with each other. These
judgments comprised the data set for the computational
analyses.

Results
Sixty-two uniquely different body parts were offered by the
participants as associates for these verbs. Figure 1 provides
a matrix of the 103 verbs by 62 body parts. The darker the
segments the higher the numbers of adults providing that
body part. As is apparent from these data, there appears to
be considerable agreement among adults and moreover,
there seems to be several clusters of verbs, from left to right
in the figure: a leg region, arm region, ear region, mouth
region, and eye region.

Subjects
Indiana University; all were native speakers of English.

Stimuli
The verbs studied were the 101 out of a total of 103 action
terms on the MacArthur Communicative Developmental
Inventory (Fenson, Dale, Reznick & Bates, 1994). Data on
two verbs tear and stay had to be removed for various
errors. In addition we incorporated two verb kneel and
tiptoe which our preliminary study on body parts had shown
were understood by children this age and had the interesting
characteristic of having the body part in their label
(Maouene, 2005). This inventory was developed from a
normative study of over 1000 16 to 30 month old children
learning English and is widely used to measure individual
children’s productive vocabulary. The 103 verbs in the
inventory are the most frequent verbs in the productive
vocabulary of children learning English during this
developmental period. There is also normative data on the
proportion of children producing each verb at monthly
intervals from 16 to 30 months, allowing us to determine the
order of acquisition of verbs in this corpus. The earliest
verb on this list (go) is known by 50% of the children at 19
months and the latest verb (wish) is not known by 50 % of
the children until after 30 months.

1) Do English adult speakers consistently associate
specific body parts with these verbs?
To answer this question, we calculated the entropy for each
verb, where P(Bb) was proportion of rating of both body
parts to total ratings (100). The entropy of body parts was
also calculated in the same way.

The participants were given a randomly ordered list of the
103 verbs and asked to supply the one body part that first
came to mind when they thought of the verb. There were no
constraints on the body part terms that participants could

Entropy is maximized when the rating of body parts is
distributed uniformly randomly, thus ratings with smaller
entropy indicate greater consistency in the adult judgments.

The maximum and minimum entropy for randomly selected
verb vectors in a Monte Carlo simulation (N=10000) were
5.76 and 5.18.

Figure 2 shows a frequency histogram of the entropy for the
103 verbs. The mean and maximum entropy of all verbs
were 1.47 (relative entropy: .255) and 3.35 (relative entropy:
.581), considerably less than that given by the Monte Carlo
simulation. These results thus indicate that the adult
participants – despite the lack of any constraints on their
judgments – agreed with each other about the body parts
associated with each of these early-learned verbs.

associated to particular body parts?

3) Can these verbs be organized in a semantic space
well structured by body parts?

To address this question, we analyzed the multidimensional
verb-body-parts (103 by 62 matrix) data with
Correspondence Analysis, which is a kind of Principal
Component Analysis for qualitative data. CA is not
sensitive to variance (as is PCA) but to correlation, in this
case between verbs and body parts. It does not need any
external criterion (i.e. only data pattern is analyzed). The
CA analysis indicated that 8 dimensions were needed to
account for 60% of the associations, 10 for 70%, 13 for 88%
and only 19 dimensions were needed to account for 90% of
the judgment data provided by the participants. This
constitutes a huge reduction from the 62 distinct body parts.
Table 1 provides evidence on the particular body parts listed
by participants, and those that were correlated with each of
the dimensions yielded by the CA.

The CA also indicated a second reduction (from 19) to 4 if
we leave aside the ear-verbs dimension, we have a fourarm-structure: mouth-verbs=-dimension1, eye-and-brain
verbs=dimension2, arm-verbs =dimension 3 and legverbs=dimension4.
This data compression strongly
suggests that the corpus of verbs as a whole is
systematically related to an organized set of body parts. The
four-arm-structure correspond to verbs strongly associated
with the legs, arms, mouth and eyes. Only a few verbs like
show (involving hand and eye) and feed (involving mouth
and hand) fall outside this organization. Ordering along the
arms as shown in Figure 3 is related to the scale of body
part involved (fingers versus hands, lips versus teeth) and
the degree of exclusivity in that body part’s association with
the verb.

difference of acquisition rate given difference of body parts
was a Poisson distribution.

Figure 4: Histogram of the number of paired verbs along
difference of acquisition rate and body parts.
Using 20 bins of difference of body part at even intervals
(i.e. from 0 to 1 with .05 intervals), the correlation between
the mean and variance was .920, and the proportionality
constant and intercept of the linear regression were .630
(t(18)=9.96, p<.001) and .0005 (t(18)=.530, p>.6). We
analyzed the mean of the distribution independent of
variance (i.e., the interval between verb pairs) because the
distribution could be considered as Poisson distribution.
The correlation between the means of difference in
acquisition rate of any two verbs and the difference in the
body part vector of the two verbs was .692 (significant
higher than zero correlation: p<.001).

corresponding to a four-arm-structure.

4) Is acquisition structured by the relevant body
parts?
To study the relation between age of acquisition and body
parts, we used a time scale that aimed at capturing the
developmental trajectory for each verb. Specifically, each
verb’s development was represented as a vector of the
proportion of children typically producing that verb
according to the normative data at monthly intervals from
16 to 30 months. The 101 verbs from MCDI were used to
calculate city-block distance of acquisition rate (from 16
month to 30 month: a 15-dimension vector) and the cityblock distance of adults’ body parts rating (a 62-dimension
vector) of every verb paired with every other verb (4950
pairs). The precise definition of verb pair difference of
acquisition rate
α (normalized by division with 15 months) and body parts β
(normalized by division with maximum difference 200:
twice of the number of ratings), where Aim and Bib are
respectively i th verb’s acquisition rate in m-month-olds and
b th body parts rating.

As the previous analysis showed that the error distribution is
Poisson distribution unlike normal distribution in regression
analysis, we analyzed using Generalized Linear Model
(GLM) with linear link function, Poisson distribution and
the acquisition rate as dependent variables. The analysis
showed the proportionality constant and intercept of the

.0095 (t(5048)=6.23, p<.001). As both coefficients were
significant, the mean paired verb’s difference in acquisition
rate α and difference in body parts β is estimated as
following the relationship. This indicates that 50%
difference of adult rating predicts .62 month difference of
verb acquisition on average.

body-part semantic space are acquired faster than those that
are nearer fewer already acquired verbs.
In brief, these three hypotheses, (1) arms organize order, (2)
degree of pureness –earliest verbs is purely related to one
body part, (3) island, only (3) island (by analysis using
Poisson distribution) was strongly supported, and (2) degree
of divergence was weakly related to acquisition order.

Body maps
Figure 6 provides a holistic representation of the
development of early verbs in terms of their associated body
parts. These body maps were developed from the original
body-map vectors constructed for each verb. The size of
each “homunculus” indicates the total number of verbs
known by 50% of children at the indicated age according to
the normative MCDI data and the size of a constituent body
part grows with the number of verbs associated with that
body part. The smallest body map shows the verb meanings
for a normative 21 month old. Normatively children this age
have nine verbs in their productive vocabulary. Body maps
for four subsequent ages are also shown: 22 months (21
verbs), 24 months (45 verbs), 26 months (74 verbs), and 30
months (96 verbs). The 5 remaining verbs (rip, pretend,
think, wish, hate) were not included because they are
acquired after 30 months of age. As is apparent, verb
acquisitions are clustered by body part. At every age,
children add new verbs related to all body parts but different
body parts dominate earlier versus later acquisitions. At 21
months, verbs involving actions of the mouth and lip
dominate accounting for 47% of the “meanings” of all verbs
known at this age. Growth in verb meanings from 22 to 24
months overwhelmingly (86% of all new meanings)
concerns actions by the limbs. The predominant region of
growth after this point is in verbs that specifically involve
the hands, counting for 58% of new meanings from 24 to 26
months and 59% of all new meanings from 26 to 30 months.
At 30 months, verbs labeling actions involving hands and
arms dominate all verb meanings, accounting for 51% of all
verbs in children’s total productive vocabulary at 30
months. Together, these body maps provide a
developmental picture of verb learning that is strongly
organized by the body’s morphology.

The key point is this: two verbs sharing that similar body
part are acquired in similar period. This is evidence that the
body-parts associated with individual verbs are related (in
some as yet unspecified way) with the developmental
ordering of verb acquisitions.
Given the analyses thus far, there are three reasonable
hypotheses about how body parts might be related to order
of acquisition.
•Hypothesis 1: The arms structure in Figure 3 orders
acquisition such that, for example, mouth verbs are early
and hand verbs are late.
•Hypothesis 2: Degree of pureness of body parts associated
predicts age of acquisition. For example, the verbs that all
adults associated with only one body part at the same scale
are acquired first.
• Hypothesis 3: Children acquire unordered islands, but
once they know a few verbs involving the same body parts,
acquisition of other verbs involving that body part occurs.
Our analyses suggest the following conclusions:
First, the arms in Figure 3 only weakly organize the order of
acquisition. Children learn at least some verbs on every arm
at every point in development. This conclusion is supported
by a one-way ANOVA to mean acquisition age (when over
50% children acquire each verb) of each verb categories
(“ear”, “mouth”, “eye”, “arm”, “legs” shown in Table 1)
showing no significant difference (F(4,56)=1.28, p=.29).
However, other analyses (presented subsequently) suggest
that mouth verbs constitute a greater proportion of earlylearned verbs and hand verbs a greater proportion of later
learned verbs.
Second, degree of pureness of “body part” also does not
predict well the order of acquisition. We investigated the
relationship between entropy and acquisition age (when
over 50% children acquire the verb) to test the hypothesis
that children learn earliest the verbs related to fewer body
parts. The correlation of the two variables was .1587 (not
significant difference to zero correlation, p=.1148, indicating
that the verbs related to fewer body parts tended to be
learned earlier.
Finally, there is data consistent with the Island hypothesis.
Verbs that are close to other already acquired verbs in the

Conclusion
These results point to the importance of the body –and our
bodily interactions in the world – in verb meaning and in the
acquisition of verbs. Granted, these results are a first step;
they show only that adults systematically relate body parts
to early learned verbs. But the nature of that systematic
relation is highly suggestive. Specifically, the results point
to the following:
(1) Only a few body parts and regions matter –ears, eyes,
mouth, legs and arms. These are the parts of the body
with which one actively engages in the world and with
others.
(2) For many early verbs, there is only one body region to
which it is related. This suggests meanings that are
grounded in specific concrete actions accomplished in
specific ways, rather than highly abstract relations that
may be done by any body part.
(3) Children’s (normative) rate of acquisition of verbs
appears related to the density of the body part region,
suggesting again, that body parts organize
developmentally relevant aspects of meaning.
(4) Verbs related to the mouth are important early although
verbs related to the hands are the most frequent in the
corpus as a whole and clearly dominate at later points in
acquisition. This last fact raises interesting questions
about the precise relation between kind of action, kind
of body part, and verb meaning.
