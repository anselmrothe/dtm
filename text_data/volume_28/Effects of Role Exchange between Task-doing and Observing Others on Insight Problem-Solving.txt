Dynamic Constraint Relaxation Theory
To examine the effects of role exchange between task-doing
and observing the partner, a theoretical framework is needed
to analyze the processes when verbal interaction is
restricted. In this study, we rely on the dynamic constraint
relaxation theory on insight problem-solving (Hiraki and
Suzuki, 1998).
   The theory hypothesizes three types of constraints: object-
level, relational, and goal constraints. The object-level
constraint is our natural tendency to encode objects at a
basic level, although there are numerous other ways of
interpretations. The relational constraint is a tendency to
choose specific relations among innumerable alternatives.              Figure 1: The T puzzle. As mentioned above, the goal
