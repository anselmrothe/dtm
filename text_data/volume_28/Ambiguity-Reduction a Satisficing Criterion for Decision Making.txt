frame of choice: for example, for an estimation of the levels
of ignorance or uncertainty. For example, if two conflicting
choices receive the same amount of support, the situation can
be evaluated as uncertain. Moreover, top-down influences of
background assumptions, which we model as the framing of
the situation, are a valuable part of the process. According
to the Competence Hypothesis in (Heath & Tversky, 1991),
even with the same data decision makers behave differently
depending on how they evaluate their competence. As a result
of the metalevel evaluative processes, ambiguity of the situ-
ation is quantified. Our assumption is that, before deciding,
a decision maker exploits its procedural expertise in order to
minimize ambiguity: this typically leads to epistemic actions,                       Figure 1: The Balance with Two Plates
