formation and persistence of neural waves that maintain
their coherence while mediating such transitions.
The Brain as an Excitable Medium Neural activity is a
thermodynamic process. A neuron, for example, is an
excitable medium in which energy is dissipated and then
replenished as the wave of excitation travels its axon. We
argue that the brain is best understood as an excitable
medium as a consequence of the metabolism of glucose and
other essential nutrients. This energy gradient is dissipated
by neural activity that is constrained by the organism’s
structure, including that arising from its history and on-
going activities. Thus, the non-linear neural waves can be
seen as a self-maintaining and self-sustaining dynamic, a
solution to the boundary conditions implicit in the structure
of the organism and the relation between the organism and
its ‘environment.’
