   As for utterance function, the hypothesis was that eye-
brow raising is associated with some linguistic communica-
tive functions and it will be unequally distributed across utter-
ances depending on the purpose of such utterances in the di-
alogue. In the kind of dialogue investigated here instructions
were the most important type of utterance for participants to
advance the dialogue and complete their task. Additionally,
the literature mentioned above suggests that we raise our eye-
brows when we ask a question. Thus, queries in the dialogues
under investigation were also predicted to have more frequent          Figure 1: Sample frame from a video-recorded dialogue, with
