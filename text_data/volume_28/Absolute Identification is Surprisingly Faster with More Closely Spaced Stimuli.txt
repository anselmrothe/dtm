Abstract

Models have been developed in attempts to give integrated explanations of accuracy and response time components of absolute identification performance, and with
surprising apparent difficulty. Karpiuk et al. (1997), for
instance, linked a rehearsal-based limited capacity model
to a counter system for this purpose, but to simulate differences between set sizes, the parameters needed to be
modified from set size to set size, and so this model does
not intrinsically explain set size effects. Nosofsky (1997)
linked an exemplar-similarity system to counters (as in
Nosofsky & Palmieri, 1997); although this model produced basically correct effects, it did not account well
for effects of set size on edge stimuli.
An alternative exemplar-similarity model, based on
the EGCM-RT (Lamberts, 2000), was produced by Kent
and Lamberts (2005). With a small modification to the
original assumptions about information accumulation of
elements of features, this model was able to account for
differences in set size with completely common assumptions and parameters. The basic operation of the model
proceeds by the sampling of elements from the stimulus dimension at random intervals and, with increased
sampling of elements, similarity to the presented stimulus of stored exemplars that mismatch this stimulus
decreases. A response may be made upon information
sampling, depending probabilistically on the equivocality of the current exemplar-stimulus similarities. Should
a response be made, the choice of the response is based
on the choice rule (Shepard, 1957; Luce, 1963).
The relative judgment model (RJM) of Stewart et al.
(2005) differs greatly in operational principles — it assumes that differences to the previous stimulus are the
main source of information in absolute identification,
and ‘confusions’ are not (primarily) due to similarity
(between stimuli), but rather limited capacity on the response scale — but it also fits accuracy data from different set sizes without an arbitrary change in parameters
(although the model has yet to be extended to response
time data).
One piece of evidence that has been adduced in favor
of relative models is a relative insensitivity to the spacing
of the stimuli — making stimuli more different makes little or no improvement in accuracy despite gross changes
in similarity (Brown, Neath, & Chater, 2002). A traditional exemplar model therefore needs to be augmented
by a relative-judgment assumption that sensitivity scales
with stimulus range to capture this effect (Brown et al.,

Bow and set size effects on response times in absolute
identification mirror the effects on accuracy: Central
stimuli and stimuli in large sets are responded to more
slowly and less accurately. In an analysis of the response time data from Experiment 1 of N. Stewart,
G. D. A. Brown and N. Chater (2005), involving the absolute identification of tone frequency (pitch), we find
that in contrast to the accuracy data, where widely
spaced stimuli are responded to slightly more accurately
than narrowly spaced stimuli, widely spaced stimuli receive slower responses than narrowly spaced stimuli.
This result poses an additional challenge for models of
absolute identification, as accuracy and response times
are not jointly linked to some unified difficulty factor.

Introduction
In absolute identification, participants learn unique associations between stimuli that vary on a simple perceptual
dimension (e.g., pitch) and ordered numerical responses.
Behavioral data that may inform us about the representations and processes involved in the performance of
this task come in the form of the responses (i.e., their
accuracy) and the time they take. Absolute identification is particularly intriguing for psychophysicist, given
the surprising finding that although observers can discriminate perfectly between stimuli drawn from the set
in pairwise comparisons, they make a great deal of error in identifying the same stimuli. Further, the limit in
identifying stimuli holds across a wide range of sensory
continua - such as tones varying in pitch, lines varying in
length, smells varying in intensity, tastes varying in their
saltiness, and cutaneous electric shocks varying in their
intensity - suggesting that the limit is a fundamental
property of the cognitive system (see Stewart, Brown, &
Chater, 2005, for a recent review).
Key effects in the accuracy data are the bow effect,
that stimuli nearer the center of the range are responded
to less accurately; the set size effect, that accuracy is reduced when there are more stimuli (and hence responses)
in the experimental set; and sequential effects — assimilation to recent responses and contrast to less recent
responses (again see Stewart et al., 2005). At least with
regard to the bow and set size effects, response times
mirror the accuracy data (in terms of a difficulty interpretation): Central stimuli and stimuli in large sets are
responded to slower (e.g. Karpiuk, Lacouture, & Marley,
1997; Kent & Lamberts, 2005).

2002, but see Lockhead, 2004, for arguments that this
does not occur).
The relevant prediction of similarity-based models is
that there should be a large advantage for more widely
spaced stimuli as the reduction in similarity reduces confusion. The advantage in accuracy is however meagre, as
illustrated with the data of Stewart et al. (2005) in Figure 3. In a basic exemplar model, the lowest accuracies
should be almost doubled by the doubling in spacing between narrow and wide conditions.
It might nonetheless be the case that there is an advantage for widely spaced stimuli, but that it obtains most
strongly in response times, rather than accuracy. We
therefore examined previously collected but unanalysed
response times from the study of Stewart et al. (2005)
for this effect.

before a blank inter-stimulus interval of 500 ms.

A total of 120 undergraduates from the University of
Warwick participated in this experiment.

Results

Two sets of ten tones varying in frequency (pitch) were
used. The set for the narrow condition had lowest frequency 768.7 Hz, and the ratio between adjacent tones
was 1.06:1. The set for the wide condition had lowest frequency 600 Hz, and the ratio between tones was
1.12:1. Tones were thus equally spaced in log-Hz, and
therefore approximately equally spaced in psychological
space. The two sets have equal means in log space.
Tones were 500 ms in duration. Over the first 50 ms,
amplitude linearly increased from zero to maximum, and
over the final 50 ms, linearly decreased from maximum
to zero.

Slow responses (greater than ten seconds) and fast reponses (less than 150 ms) were excluded from all analyses. Incorrect responses were not excluded, although
doing so gives a similar pattern of results.
The relationship between overall mean response time,
set size and spacing is illustrated in Figure 1. An
ANOVA confirmed that there were significant effects of
set size (F (2, 114) = 13.89, p < .0001, η 2 = .137) and
spacing (F (1, 114) = 4.57, p < .05, η 2 = .027), but no
interaction (F (2, 114) = 0.28, p > .7, η 2 = .003).
These results are broken down by stimulus in Figure 2, with the corresponding accuracy statistics in Figure 3 (cf. Figure 11 of Stewart et al., 2005). Whilst
the cost in response is apparent in this break-down,
the edge (lowest and highest) stimuli within each set
size appear to be immune to the effect. An ANOVA
with a further factor of the two edge stimuli vs. all
other stimuli continued to demonstrate a significant set
size effect (F (2, 114) = 11.86, p < .0001, η 2 = .136)
and a spacing effect in the margin (F (1, 114) = 2.91,
p = .09, η 2 = .017), and critically showed a significant interaction between spacing and stimulus endness
(F (1, 114) = 15.71, p < .001, η 2 = .008). There was
also evidence for a main effect of edgeness of stimuli,
an interaction between stimulus edgeness and set size,
and the three-way interaction. ANOVAs conducted separately for end and non-end stimuli confirmed that nonend stimuli showed an effect of spacing (F (1, 114) = 6.00,
p < .05, η 2 = .042), but there was no evidence of this
for end stimuli (F (1, 144) = 0.38, p > .5, η 2 = .003).

Design
Spacing of tones (narrow and wide) was crossed with
set sizes of six, eight and ten stimuli (chosen from the
center of the range) to produce six between-participants
conditions.

Procedure
Within each of seven blocks that were 120 trials long,
each tone was presented equally often, and ordering was
randomized was within blocks.
On each trial, a tone was presented over headphones
simultaneously with a visually presented “?” that remained on the computer screen until the participant responded with a key from those labeled “1” to “10”. The
ordering of the correct assignment was counterbalanced
over participants. Although a computer keyboard is not
ideal for the comparison of different responses, the primary comparisons here are of responses with the same
key, and between stimuli, so this should not affect the

(q, α or λ), or to the criterion for responding (θ). Although a different stopping criterion for each spacing
would almost certainly give the correct form of results,
Kent and Lamberts (2005) have correctly avoided varying parameters freely between conditions because doing
so begs the question: Why do participants behave differently in different conditions?
The effect of stimulus spacing on response time would
also seem to be inconsistent with Stewart et al.’s (2005)
RJM. In its basic form, without allowance for stimulus
noise, the model treats different stimulus spacings identically. Any extended version of this model intended to
account for response times must include a mechanism
that causes response times for central stimuli to be sensitive to stimulus spacing.
Even if accuracy differences are due to greater perceptual noise in the narrow condition, this does not explain
why this condition is faster. If accuracy differences are
in fact due to the reduction in time spent on the narrow
condition, this does not explain why participants systematically choose to spend less time on this condition;
otherwise said, what rule relates condition to stopping
criterion?
Suppose that, for instance, judgments in the narrow
are more difficult and hence would be slower and less
accurate. Then, participants might attempt to compensate by performing faster in the narrow condition but
overcompensate to be faster than in the wide condition.
With more levels of spacing, it may be possible to test
a specific model of such a threshold (over-)adjustment.
However, if the adjustment in threshold is so severe, why
is accuracy relatively preserved? Alternatively, participants may (possibly incorrectly) think the narrow condition too difficult and expend less effort for a gain in speed
with only a small accuracy penalty. If this is the case,
a full account will explain why differences in set sizes
do not follow the pattern, since larger set sizes must be
slower and subjectively more difficult, and yet do not
yield faster responses.
Reversing the trade-off to be a slowing to compensate for inadequate accuracy would have to mean that
the wide condition is intrinsically more difficult, and
accuracy is overcompensated. This might be the case
within the Luce, Green, and Weber (1976) attentionband model of absolute identification, as the attention
band will cover a smaller region and so is less likely to
cover the current stimulus. This model does not, however, extend to response times nor account for biases
due to sequential effects. Another possibility is that the
wider condition is more difficult because it is further removed from the natural psychological number scale for
tone frequency (see Gescheider, 1988, for a discussion of
evidence that such a scale exists).
In any case, none of these possibilities readily explains
the interaction between the bow and spacing effects:
Edge stimuli are no slower in a wide spacing condition,
but they are more accurate, whereas center stimuli are
both slower and more accurate in the wide spacing condition. It is unclear why this should be the case. Overall, the relationship between response time and spacing

We optimised parameters for the EGCM-RT for absolute identification (Kent & Lamberts, 2005) by the minimization of the sum squared deviation from the points
in Figures 2 and 3, with the deviation measured in standard errors of the mean to approximately equalize the
influence of response time and accuracy. Only the sensitivity parameter (c) was permitted to vary between
spacings, to allow for adjustment of scale. The residual
time parameter (tres ) was constrained to be at least 150
ms as this is intended to include the motor component
of response (Kent and Lamberts use 250 ms), and other
parameters were constrained to be non-negative.
The best fits obtained from this procedure are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 (parameters were q = 0.0005,
cnarrow = 0.55, cwide = 0.35, θ = 1.73, tres = 150,
α = 0.64, and λ = 0.00). The ratio between c for narrow
and wide conditions was close to 2, the value suggested
by Brown et al.’s (2002) relative-judgment assumption
(although this cannot be range-based for the EGCMRT as this would be inconsistent with its explanation of
the set size effect) but the wide spacing condition was
nevertheless predicted to be more accurate and quicker
than the narrow condition. To examine whether this
was due to under-weighting of the response time component, we conducted new optimizations weighting the
response time squared discrepancies by a factor of 10.
This simply reversed the predictions: Wide spacing was
predicted to be slightly less accurate and slower than the
narrow condition. Permitting tres to vary between conditions (reflecting, for example, differing rescaling costs)
resulted in essentially no improvement in fit, because this
parameter was already straining at the bound.

Discussion
The new analysis showed an effect of spacing on response
times such that responses were slower for widely spaced
stimuli despite the responses to these stimuli being more
accurate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
examination of the effect on response times of the manipulation of the spacing of the stimulus set independently
of set size and practice1 . The effect on response time did
not appear to be a uniform cost of, for instance, rescaling, because edge stimuli were immune to the effect.
The EGCM-RT could not account for these results
when only sensitivity (c) and residual time (tres ) were
permitted to differ between spacings. The reason for this
problem is that both stopping probability (and hence response time) and accuracy are linked to the equivocality of the current similarities ratings: Stopping is more
likely to occur (sooner) and responses are more likely to
be correct when the similarities strongly favor the single
correct response.
The remaining parameters are supposed either to relate to basic perceptual rates or similarity calculations
1

Lacouture (1997) compared these conditions, but participants always participated in the narrow condition before the
wide, and so the reverse effect in his data may be due to
practice.
