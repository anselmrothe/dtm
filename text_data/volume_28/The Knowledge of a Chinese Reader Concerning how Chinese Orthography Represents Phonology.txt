pronunciation of an unknown character. S/he will use its
right component to guess the character’s pronunciation if
the component is a pronounceable character itself. In the
case that the component is not a pronounceable character,
the reader will infer the pronunciation of the unknown
character from its neighbors which also contain the
component.

Abstract
A phonetically aware Chinese reader is able to infer the
pronunciation of an unknown character from its constituent
components; especially the one occupies the right half of the
character. According to the statistical model of language
learning, such a position strategy is really a bias
representation of how Chinese characters representing
phonology. This research tested the two positions by
collecting the way subjects pronounced two types of pseudocharacters, one with a high validity phonetic on the right and
the other on the left. Although the results supported the
statistical model, it also showed that the position strategy was
a dominant heuristic subjects relied on to guess the
pronunciations of unknown characters.

Introduction
A Chinese character is composed of line strokes, and thus
does not carry the kind of grapheme-phoneme
correspondence an alphabetic word usually possesses. It had
been shown that because the Chinese orthography is not
designed to represent phonology, without proper training of
Chinese phonemes, a Chinese reader could not develop
phonemic awareness (Cheung & Chen, 2004; Read, Zhang,
Nie, & Ding, 1986). However, Shu, Anderson and Wu
(2000) showed that a reader of simplified characters is able
to develop the so called “phonetic awareness” as s/he learns
to read increasing numbers of characters, and similar finding
was also reported for readers of traditional characters (Hue,
2003).
Similar to a person with phonemic awareness, Shu et al.
(2000) argued that a child who is phonetically aware has
“ …the insight into the principles that govern orthographyphonology relationships in Chinese …”, and is able to form
hypotheses to guide “…perceptual processing, strategies for
learning and retrieving the pronunciations of characters,
and … to forecast the pronunciations of unfamiliar
characters….(p. 57)” They pointed out that the majority of
the frequently used character are phonograms which are
composed of two components, a phonetic located at the
right half of a character and a radical located at the left
(upper panel of Fig. 1). As a result, a phonetically aware
reader is able to develop a position strategy to guess the

component as the phonetic and one with its left component
as the phonetic.
Although Hsiao and Shillcock (2005) did not provide the
statistics concerning how the various parts of a Chinese
character representing phonology, they mentioned that the
position of a phonetic is not fixed in a Chinese character,
whether or not the character is a two-component phonogram
(lower panel of Fig. 1). To test Hsiao and Shillcock’s
argument, the characters contained in the frequency norms
prepared by the Chinese Knowledge Information Processing

represented in characters is different for the characters used
by children and the characters used by adults. It is possible
that the majority of the characters used by children are
phonograms, and in these phonograms, it is the right
components providing phonetic cues, and the left
component does not. In such a reading environment, a child
is likely to develop a position strategy, and the strategy is
kept while the child grows up. This explanation has to be
discounted because we have just showed in Table 1 that less
than 20% of the characters used in the first two years in
school use their right components as phonetics. Among the
left-and-right arranged characters, the ratio is less than 40%,
and there are about 8% of them with a left component as
phonetic.
The second possible explanation is that the participants of
studies by Shu et al. (2000) and Hue (2003) used a position
strategy to infer an unfamiliar or a pseudo-character’s
pronunciation because the stimulus characters used in these
studies possessed the same orthographical structure, i.e., a
radical on the left and a phonetic on the right. Although all
the radicals are pronounceable, very few people know how
to pronounce them. Thus, in these studies, the only
phonological information a stimulus item provided for a
participant to make response was the pronunciation of its
right component. This explanation was tested in the present
research. By and large, this research followed Shu et al.
(2000) and Hue’s (2003) methods to collect how college
and elementary school students pronouncing pseudo- and
real characters. However, to avoid the possible response

Group (the CKIPG character frequency norm ,1993) and the
characters contained in the 12 volumes of Elementary
Chinese used in the elementary schools in Taiwan were
analyzed concerning how phonology is represented in
characters. As shown in Table 1, in the characters used by
the first to the sixth graders and the general public, there
were 79%, 85%, 87%, 89%, 90%, 91%, and 93% twocomponent characters, respectively. Among the characters
with their two components left and right arranged, there
were 38%, 39%, 42%, 44%, 46%, 48% and 53% of the
characters with a right component providing useful phonetic
hints. Moreover, we found that in all the character
populations, there are about 7% of the left-and-right
arranged characters with a left component providing cues to
the pronunciation of the character.
A number of research have demonstrated that the
statistical nature of linguistic input can be acquired by a
learner through repetitive encountering of the language
(Aslin, Saffran, & Newport, 1998; Saffran, Aslin , &
Newport, 1996). According to this line of research, a
Chinese reader’s knowledge (or meta-linguistic awareness)
concerning how characters represent phonology should
reflect the statistical distribution of how the various parts of
a character represent phonology. Obviously, this prediction
was not confirmed by the previous research on how Chinese
readers guess the pronunciations of unknown characters
(Hue, 2003; Shu, Anderson & Wu, 2000).There are two
possible explanations to account for the research results
reported by Shu et al. and by Hue. The first possibility is
that the statistical distribution concerning how phonology is

to review all the pronunciations they responded and to
explain why they made these responses1.

Method

Results

Participants
Twenty-two college and 288 grade school students
participated in this experiment. Among the grade school
students, there were 93 sixth graders, 63 fourth and 132
second graders. The second graders were further divided
into two groups, those were tested at the end of a first
semester (48 children), and those were tested in at the end of
a second semester (84 children). All the participants were
residents of Taiwan, and were native speakers of Chinese.

Materials and Procedure
The components which were either radicals and
characters used to construct the characters of the 7
characters populations were first identified. The phonetic
validities of the components were then computed. The
phonetic validity of a component was defined as the ratio
between the number of characters in a targeting character
population containing it and the number of characters that it
provides useful phonetic hints. In this study, the phonetic
validity of a component was defined as high if the ratio was
higher than 0.6, and low if the ratio was lower than 0.3.
The test items were different for the five groups of
participants, although the principles of selection (or
construction) of the items were the same. (1) The test items
were real- and pseudo-characters, and were all consisted of
two left-and-right arranged components. The questionnaire
for college students contained 24 real- and 30 pseudocharacters. The questionnaire for the grade school students
contained 12 real- and 24 pseudo-characters. (2) For the
grade school students, the real characters were selected from
the character populations corresponding to their grades. A
college student was estimated to know about 5150
characters (Hue, 2003), and thus the real characters in the
questionnaire presented to the college students were selected
from the high frequency characters contained in the CKIPG
character frequency norm (1993) which contains 5656
characters. With this sampling method, the participants
should know the pronunciations of the real characters
contained in their questionnaires. (3) There were two types
of pseudo-characters, one with a high validity phonetic as
right component and the other with a high validity phonetic
as left component. The phonetic validity of a component
was computed separately for the five participant populations
based on their corresponding character populations.
The participants were tested individually, and in the test,
a questionnaire in which the test items were printed one
item a line was presented to each participant. They were
asked to write down the pronunciation for each item using
the Mandarin Phonetic Alphabets, which were taught in the
first month of the first grade in every elementary school in

Data from 6 six graders was excluded from analysis
because they didn’t finish the experiment. A participant’s
response to the pronunciation of an item was categorized
into one of seven categories, according to her/his “reason of
response” and the experimenters’ best judgment. Because
the purpose of the present study was to find out which
component of a test item was used by the participants to
infer the item’s pronunciation, the following analyses were
performed on the participants’ responses to the pseudocharacters. Table 2 showed the means of the ratios as a
function of Participant Group, Response Category and
Pseudo-character Type.
The ratios that the participants used the right component
of a pseudo-character to respond were analyzed separately
from the ratios that they used the left component to respond.
The data was analyzed using a mixed model of analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with Participant Group (5 levels; 2nd-1,
2nd-2, 4th, 6th graders and college students) as the between
subject variable and Pseudo-character Type (2 levels; high
phonetic validity component on the right or on the left) as
the within subject variable.
Analysis of the ratios of the response which was made
based on the right component of a pseudo-character
revealed significant effects of Participant Group (F(4, 299)
= 23.20, Mse = 0.04, p < .0001) and Pseudo-character Type
(F(1, 299) = 875.4, Mse = 0.04, p < .0001). In addition, the
interaction of the two variables was also significant (F(4,
299) = 26.70, Mse = 0.04, p < .0001). These effects
indicated that the participants were more likely to use the
right component of a test item to infer the item’s
pronunciation if the item’s right component was high in
phonetic validity, and the tendency to use the right
component of an item to respond enhanced for the
participants with larger vocabulary size.
Analysis of the ratios of the response based on the left
component of a pseudo-character revealed a significant
effect of Pseudo-character Type (F(1, 299) = 772.97, MSe =
0.02, p < .0001). In addition, the interaction between the
two independent variables (F(4, 299) = 21.43, MSe = 0.02,
p < .0001) was also significant. Results of the analysis of
simple main effects indicated that compared with younger
participants, older participants were more likely to use the
left component of a pseudo-character to infer the character’s
pronunciation if the left component was high in phonetic
validity (F(4, 299) = 10.99, MSe = 0.02, p < .0001), and
they were less likely to use the left component of a character
to infer character pronunciation if the right component was
high in phonetic validity (F(4, 299) = 7.83, MSe = 0.02, p
< .0001).

pronunciation, but also its left component. That is, the
results provided support for the statistical model of language
learning. Moreover, the results that the two groups of
second graders were able to use character components to
infer character pronunciation indicated that the statistical
nature of how phonological information is represented in
characters is acquired fairly early by a Chinese reader.
However, the significant interaction effects between
Participant Group and Pseudo-character Type indicated that
as a reader knows more characters, s/he will develop a right
position heuristic to infer character pronunciation.

Discussion
An analysis of the characters used by children and adults
showed that in a considerable number of characters, the
components of a character provide cues to the pronunciation
of the character. The purpose of the present research was to
investigate how a reader of Chinese represents the kind of
correspondence, and how s/he uses this knowledge to guess
the pronunciation of an unknown character. In particular,
two positions, the statistical model and the right position
strategy, concerning the issue were tested in this research.
We showed that with proper design of the stimuli, the
participants of this research used not only the right
component of a pseudo-character to infer the character’s
