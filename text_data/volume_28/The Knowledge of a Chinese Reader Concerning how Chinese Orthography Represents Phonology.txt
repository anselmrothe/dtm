   collecting the way subjects pronounced two types of pseudo-
   characters, one with a high validity phonetic on the right and
   the other on the left. Although the results supported the

   a dominant heuristic subjects relied on to guess the
   pronunciations of unknown characters.
                            Introduction
   A Chinese character is composed of line strokes, and thus
does not carry the kind of grapheme-phoneme
correspondence an alphabetic word usually possesses. It had
been shown that because the Chinese orthography is not
designed to represent phonology, without proper training of
Chinese phonemes, a Chinese reader could not develop
phonemic awareness (Cheung & Chen, 2004; Read, Zhang,
Nie, & Ding, 1986). However, Shu, Anderson and Wu
(2000) showed that a reader of simplified characters is able
to develop the so called “phonetic awareness” as s/he learns
to read increasing numbers of characters, and similar finding
was also reported for readers of traditional characters (Hue,
2003).
   Similar to a person with phonemic awareness, Shu et al.
(2000) argued that a child who is phonetically aware has                 Figure 1: Two two-component characters, one with its right

                               Discussion
    An analysis of the characters used by children and adults
 showed that in a considerable number of characters, the
 components of a character provide cues to the pronunciation
 of the character. The purpose of the present research was to
 investigate how a reader of Chinese represents the kind of
 correspondence, and how s/he uses this knowledge to guess
 the pronunciation of an unknown character. In particular,
 two positions, the statistical model and the right position
 strategy, concerning the issue were tested in this research.
 We showed that with proper design of the stimuli, the
 participants of this research used not only the right
 component of a pseudo-character to infer the character’s
