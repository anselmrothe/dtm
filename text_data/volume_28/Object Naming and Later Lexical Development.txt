additionally studied to what extent features can fully explain
naming differences between children and adults. We expected
that the features would not provide a full account of the

the idiosyncrasies in a language.
Method
Materials. The linguistic categories for which features were
generated were extracted from the adult naming data (Ameel
et al., 2005). We selected the 6 names that were dominant for
the largest numbers of objects for the adults: ‘fles’, ‘bus’,
‘pot’, ‘brik’, ‘doos’ and ‘tube’.
