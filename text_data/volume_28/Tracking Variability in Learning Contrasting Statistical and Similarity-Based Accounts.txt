Figure 1: Two categories differing in variability are shown. Dark triangles (L1–L6 and H1–H6) represent training items and
light triangles (N1–N11) represent novel items that did not appear during learning. The item lengths are spaced to scale.
Item N6 is exactly midway between the nearest studied members (L6 and H1) of the low- and high-variability categories.
Items in the low-variability category differ from the nearest studied member by 2 pixels, whereas items in the high-variability
category differ from the nearest studied member by 20 pixels. To eliminate possible influences of absolute line length on

fewer standard deviations from cluster L’s than cluster H’s mean (indicated by arrows), leading to greater activation and higher
response probability for the low-variability category. The opposite pattern is observed after learning due to the tightening of
cluster L and the widening of cluster H, which makes the clusters relatively more responsive to their members, and item N6 is
now more likely to be assigned to the high-variability category. This process occurs for every exemplar in the exemplar model.
