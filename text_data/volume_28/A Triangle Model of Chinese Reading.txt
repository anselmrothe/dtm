“regular.” Families in which all the phonograms match in
pronunciation are called “consistent.”
   For most families, however, the pronunciation of at least
some of the family members differs from the pronunciation
of the phonetic, such as “ /tai/,         /dai/, /yi/,     /tai/,
   /chi/”. All phonograms in such a family are called
“inconsistent,” and those particular phonograms that do not
match the phonetic are called “irregular.”
   Research on Chinese has revealed both regularity and
consistency effects that interact with frequency. Seidenberg
