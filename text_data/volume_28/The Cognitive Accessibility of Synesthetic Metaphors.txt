ality claim, which is more akin to Williams than to Ull-
mann, could be confirmed. The order of sense modalities
is not simply linear (as claimed by Ullmann), but also
not even transitive (as still held by Williams). The or-

as shown in Fig. 7. No mapping allowed by Williams
is now forbidden, however, additional mappings are now
allowed. Contrary to Williams, the direction SD color to
TD touch enhances cognitive accessibility. The direction
SD color to TD smell as well as the reverse direction is
no longer forbidden. For, no significant reduction of ac-
cessibility could be observed. The same holds for both
directions between color and taste. Unlike Williams, we
cannot predict that both directions between color and
sound enhance accessibility. For, neither significant en-                        Figure 7: Directionalities according to our data. Black

   As for Williams and even Ullmann, the modality touch
is the best source domain. The only not significantly
