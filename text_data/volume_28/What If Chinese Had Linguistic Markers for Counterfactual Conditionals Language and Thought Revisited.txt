Procedure
Participants were asked to read a sentence, and then judge                                 100
whether a statement was true or false based on their
understanding of the sentence they read before. They                                       80
identified the likelihood of the statements being true on a
scale of 0-100%..                                                                          60

   There was an additional task in the Chinese test. In this
forced choice task, participants were asked to read a dialog                               40

pair of sentences to fill in the blank. There were 2 kinds of                              20
settings of the dialog: open setting where the correct answer
is an open conditional, and counterfactual setting where the                                0

   Secondly, the study began to uncover some potential
language-universals. For example, few people would have
guessed before this study that Chinese uses the temporal
(tense) and aspect markers to signify a counterfactual
interpretation. The analogy with the English subjunctive
mood – which modifies the tense and aspect of the main
verbs – is obvious. More research, particularly cross-
