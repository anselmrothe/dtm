the feature values in kind k are well predicted by the
object categories chosen for kind k: that is, when all

   Now that the three terms in Equation 2 have been
specified, we can see that CrossCat captures a tradeoff
between two competing factors. The terms P (z) and
P (wk ) specify a preference for simple solutions that use

favors solutions that explain the data well, and tends to
prefer more complex solutions. By combining all three
terms, we arrive at a model that attempts to find the
simplest solution that adequately accounts for the data.

Figure 7: The best solution found by CrossCat for the animals data includes three systems of categories: (a) a taxonomic
system, (b) a set of uninformative features and (c) an ecological system. Objects are labeled for the taxonomic and ecological
systems. Features are presented in order of decreasing predictability. Due to space constraints, only every other feature is
labeled.
