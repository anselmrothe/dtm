   Hence, we propose that one contributory factor towards
the arbitrariness of the form-meaning relationship for words
is the effect of learnability of such pairings under noisy
conditions and when contextual information is present.
   However, the child has also to learn the structure of the
language in addition to its lexical items. Hence, developing
knowledge about the general category to which a word
belongs as quickly as possible is going to be useful for
developing knowledge about the structure of the language
and further supplementing the contextual information
available to assist in identifying the particular word. As a
shorthand for general categories to which words belong, we
use the word’s lexical category.
   In this paper, we explore four hypotheses about the role of
arbitrary and systematic mappings for language learning.
     1. In the first study, we employ a neural network
           model to investigate our hypothesis that if
           contextual information is present, words can be
           learned more quickly under noisy conditions when         Figure 1: The neural network model of learning mappings
