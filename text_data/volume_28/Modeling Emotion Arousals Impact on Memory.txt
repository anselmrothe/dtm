Therefore, development is underway of a comprehensive
computational model of emotion that is targeted at
integration with cognition. This model is being formulated
in terms of general mechanisms of the emotional system
that interact with cognition and provide a mapping to
typical emotional states, such as anger and happiness. An                           Figure 1: Representation of Emotion
