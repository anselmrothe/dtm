The generation of collectives has been addressed by Stone                            A
(2000) within a constraint-based framework. The idea is to
find, for a given target set R, a salient

a set of properties P such that p∈P kpk = R. However,
the empirical question of what constitutes a salient cover is                        C

intended referent. The sequence is then rendered linguisti-                          F

strategy can easily be generalised to sets of objects; however,

of groups’, as proposed by Funakoshi et al. (2004), it was
 usually limited to a reference to the immediately containing
 set, followed by a reference to the target.
