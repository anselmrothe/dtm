          One difficulty with the Leopold et al (2001) study
is that subjects required extensive training not only on the
endpoints but also on faces along the trajectories. That is
subjects spent hundreds of trials learning to identify a face
that was only 10% of the way towards a particular identity.
Subjects might have been trained to represent these faces
with a prototype that did not exist before the experiment. In

experiment 1. Faces were recognized better when morphed
with the adapting stimulus (same – dark line) than when

Organizing the data in this way highlights the fact that
performance for a particular face is dependent on the
adapting stimulus.
                      Experiment 2
Experiment 1 showed that adaptation to an unknown face
decreased the amount of a famous face needed in an image
in order to recognize it. This effect was specific to morphs
that used the same unknown face as an endpoint as an
adapting stimulus. The effect of adaptation depended on the
adapting stimulus thus ruling out the possibility that the
improved recognition was simply due to some of the faces
being more recognizable than others. The effect was also
present in an item analysis, with 7 of the 8 items showing
