this case, a RESULT relation supports non-parallel reference.
   As this example involves a single utterance with two
potential interpretations, there is clearly no morpho-
syntactic trigger which can select between the two. The only
difference between the two interpretations is the supporting
coherence frame. We argue that any successful account of
the data presented here, including ambiguities like (20),
must appeal to coherence.
