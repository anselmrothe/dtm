1995) and the Brill (1995) part-of-speech tagger for a
variety of syntactic categories. Graesser et al. (2004)
provide an extensive overview of the many language
features provided. Coh-Metrix currently analyzes texts on
three major categories of cohesion: coreference, conceptual
(LSA), and connectivity (including causal cohesion). One
of the goals in the Coh-Metrix project is to compare the
various measures and determine which ones best account
for cohesion and coherence.
For decades, computational measures of text difficulty
have been restricted to readability formulas. Readability
formulas, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL;
Klare, 1974-1975), focus on shallow textual aspects, such
as sentence and word length. Certainly these features have
considerable validity as indices of text difficulty. However,
such shallow aspects alone explain only a part of text
comprehension, and ignore many language and discourse
features that are theoretically influential at estimating
comprehension difficulty.
Recent advances across various disciplines have made it
possible to computationally measure characteristics of text
and language. These measures can now supercede surface
components of text and instead explore deeper, more global
discourse attributes (Graesser et al., 2004). A number of
studies have used the Coh-Metrix to distinguish between
different types of texts. For example, Louwerse et al.
(2004) used Coh-Metrix to distinguish significant
differences between spoken and written varieties of
English; and McCarthy et al. (2006) demonstrated that
Coh-Metrix successfully detected authorship even though
individual authors recorded significant shifts in their
writing style. The goal of the current study is to validate the
indices of cohesion provided in Coh-Metrix by verifying its
ability to discriminate between high and low-cohesion
versions of texts. To this end, we have collected 19 pairs of
texts with high and low-cohesion versions from 12
published studies.

Abstract
Coh-Metrix is a computer program that analyzes various text
features relevant to text comprehension by incorporating
techniques informed by theories of text processing, cognitive
psychology, and computational linguistics. Three key classes of
cohesion indices (i.e., coreference, conceptual relations,
connectivity) measured by Coh-Metrix are evaluated with texts
used in published studies of cohesion effects on reading
comprehension. The results confirmed that Coh-Metrix
successfully detects levels of cohesion in texts.

Introduction
Many studies, across a variety of paradigms and
dependent measures, have shown that cohesive cues in text
facilitate reading comprehension (Britton & Gulgoz, 1988;
McNamara, 2001; Zwaan & Radvanksy, 1998). Cohesion
is the degree to which ideas in the text are explicitly related
to each other. Cohesion differs from coherence in that
cohesion is an objective property of the text and coherence
refers to the quality of the mental representation
constructed by a reader. As such, cohesive elements are
text features that tend to help readers construct a coherent
mental representation of text content. Cohesion arises from
a variety of sources, including explicit argument overlap
and causal relationships, and can operate between
sentences, groups of sentences, paragraphs, and chapters
(Giv√≥n, 1995; Graesser, McNamara, & Louwerse, 2003;
Kintsch, 1995). Cohesion particularly enhances
comprehension of text, or coherence, for low-knowledge
readers because they are less able to infer relations between
the ideas in the text (Loxterman, Beck, & McKeown, 1994;
McNamara, 2001; McNamara et al., 1996).
The notion that comprehension partially depends on text
cohesion has led to the development of a computational
tool, called Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2004;
cohmetrix.memphis.edu). This tool augments conventional
readability formulas with computational indices of text
cohesion. Coh-Metrix v1.4 has lexicons, part-of-speech
classifiers, syntactic parsers, latent semantic analysis, and
several other components that are widely used in
computational linguistics. For example, the MRC database
(Coltheart, 1981) is used for psycholinguistic information;
WordNet (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross & Miller,
1990) for hypernymy and hyponymy relations; Latent
Semantic Analysis (Landauer & Dumais, 1997) for the
semantic similarities between words, sentences, and
paragraphs; and the ApplePie parser (Sekine & Grishman,

Corpus
The texts were collected from prior experimental studies
that have investigated the effect of referential and causal
cohesion on comprehension of natural (multi-paragraph)
text. We initially identified 34 studies on text revision that
met our criteria by searching through journal articles and
reviews (e.g., Britton, Gulgoz, & Glynn, 1993). We were
able to obtain the texts for 13 of the 34 studies. Two studies
were redundant, however, because they used the same
texts. This resulted in a total of 19 pairs of texts from 12

573

1985). Repairs to the causal structure/organization of the
texts included arranging events in temporal order, making
goals of the character explicit, and repairing coherence
breaks caused by inadequate explanation, multiple
causality, or distant causal relations.
A text on the Russian revolution in Vidal-Abarca,
Martinez, and Gilabert (2000) was obtained from an 8th
grade history textbook. The maximally coherent version
included both argument overlap revisions (see Britton &
Gulgoz, 1991) and causal construction revisions (see
Trabasso & van den Broek, 1985).
Cataldo and Oakhill (2000) examined narrative stories
written for children, including an original, coherent version
and a scrambled version with randomly reordered
sentences. A text used in Lehman and Schraw (2002; Exp.
2), The Quest for Northwest Passage, was a historical
narrative. In this analysis, we compared the original text
and the maximally incoherent text. Producing an incoherent
text involved presenting selected sentences in each
paragraph in the altered order to reduce local coherence.
Also, the temporal flow of the story was interrupted to
reduce global coherence.

studies, described below. Although some of these studies
included more than two versions of the texts, this analysis
is limited to the comparison between the highest and lowest
cohesion versions.
The Raccoon text in the Beck, McKeown, Omason, &
Pople (1984) study was from a 2nd grade text book. The
revision alleviated problems in surface structure (e.g.,
syntactic complexity, unclear relations between reference
and referent), unfamiliarity of events, and ambiguity or
confusability of the content. Four social studies texts from
Beck, McKeown, Sinatra, and Loxterman (1991) were
from a 5th grade text book. The text revisions made
connections more explicit and increased causal connections
between the ideas, concepts, and events by clarifying,
elaborating, explaining, and motivating important
information. The El Nino text in the Loxterman, Beck, and
MacKeown (1994) study was obtained from a 6th grade
social studies text book. The revisions followed the same
method used in the Beck et al. (1991) study.
The Air War in the North, a college level text used in
Britton and Gulgoz (1991; McNamara & Kintsch, 1996),
was revised based on a specific theory of text processing
(Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978). Coherence breaks were
repaired in the principled revision by providing argument
overlap, presenting known ideas before new ideas in
sentences, and/or making explicit any implicit references.
Revisions to Peru and Argentina (E. Kintsch, 1990), a 6th
grade text, also followed the Kintsch and van Dijk (1978)
model. Four text versions were created by disrupting the
macrostructure (e.g., shifting topics) and microstructure
(e.g., difficult words, longer and more complex sentence
patterns, fewer connectives) of the original text.
Traits of mammals from McNamara et al. (1996; Exp. 1)
was a biology text for 6th to 8th grade students. The original
text was locally coherent but had a list like structure at a
more global level. Thus, the revision made links more
explicit between subtopics and the main topic by adding
information. The Heart Disease text (Exp. 2) was based on
an entry in a science encyclopedia for school age students.
The high-cohesion version examined here included
revisions at the local and global levels. Local changes
included replacing pronouns with noun phrases, adding
descriptive elaborations and connectives, and increasing
argument overlap. Global manipulations included adding
topic headers and topic sentences to link each paragraph to
the rest of the text and overall topic. The Cell Division text
from McNamara (2001) was from a middle school
textbook. The manipulations were similar to the changes in
McNamara et al. (1996; Exp. 2).
The Voss and Silfies (1996) study included two college
level texts describing series of events in two different
fictional sets of countries. Text manipulations involved
elaborations of causal factors related to the events. Two
social studies texts used in Linderholm et al. (2000),
Mademoiselle Germaine (easy text) and Project X-Ray
(difficult text) were revised based on the causal network
theory of comprehension (Trabasso & van den Broek,

Results and Discussion
The 19 pairs of high and low-cohesion texts were
analyzed using Coh-Metrix 1.4. ANOVAs were conducted
to test for significant differences between the high and lowcohesion text versions. The significance value is p <.05
unless otherwise stated.

Descriptive and Readability Statistics
Table 1 shows the traditional readability statistics (i.e.,
Flesh-Kincaid Grade level; FKGL) for the low and highcohesion texts. These statistics show that the high-cohesion
texts tend to include more words, F(1,18)=18.21,
sentences, F(1,18)=7.09, and words per sentence,
F(1,18)=17.08. As a result, the FKGL index is higher,
F(1,18)=4.64. Increasing cohesion requires adding words to
fill in the conceptual gaps. Hence, grade level tends to
increase because it is partially driven by the number of
words per sentence. As such, grade level indices would
predict that lower cohesion texts are easier than higher
cohesion texts. This presumably is not true generally, and is
definitely not true in the case of these particular texts.

comparing the high and low-cohesion versions of the 19
texts. The mixed ANOVA included the within-text factors
of cohesion (high, low), index type (noun, argument, stem),
distance (all distances, 2 sentences, 3 sentences) and weight
(unweighted, weighted). Adjacent indices could not be
included in this analysis because a weighted version does
not exist. There were main effects of cohesion,
F(1,18)=23.36, MSe=0.136, index type, F(1,18)=36.32,
MSe=0.789, distance, F(1,18)=45.78, MSe=0.016, and
weight, F(1,18)=41.84, MSe=0.004. There was an
interaction between distance and weight, F(1,18)=42.69,
MSe=0.001, indicating that weighting affected the alldistance indices, Munwtd=0.32 Mwtd=0.38, but had little
effect on either two-sentence, Munwtd=0.44, Mwtd=0.46, or
three-sentence, Munwtd=0.42 Mwtd=0.44, distances. Cohesion
interacted with weight, F(1,18)=9.11, MSe=0.001, such that
weighted algorithms yielded larger differences, Diff=0.144,
than did unweighted algorithms, Diff=0.126. Cohesion also
interacted with distance, F(1,18)=11.25, MSe=0.003,
indicative of larger differences for local indices of
coreference, Diff2sent=0.152; Diff3sent=0.140, than the alldistances algorithms, Diffall=0.110.
In summary, the local indices (i.e., 2 and 3 sentence
distances) and weighted algorithms tended to yield greater
differences between the two text versions. Although
cohesion did not interact with index type, F(1,18)=2.28, it
is apparent in Table 2 that noun overlap indices yielded the
most robust differences between text versions. However, all
of the coreference indices successfully showed differences
between the high and low-cohesion versions.

Coreference
Coh-Metrix provides three general types of coreference
indices. Noun overlap is overlap between nouns, with no
deviation in form. Argument overlap is overlap between the
noun in the target sentence and the same noun in singular
or plural form in the previous sentence. Stem overlap is
overlap from the noun to stems, regardless of word type
(e.g., noun, verb, adjective). Thus, stem overlap could
include overlap between giver in the target sentence and
giver, giving, or gave in previous sentences. Both argument
and stem overlap also include overlap between a pronoun
and the same pronoun.
Coreference indices also vary by distance between the
target sentence and coreferent sentences. Adjacent overlap
includes only adjacent sentences. Distances of two or three
sentences include the target sentence and the two or three
previous sentences, respectively. All distances consist of
the overlap between each sentence with all other sentences
in the text ‚Äì this is intended as a more global index of
cohesion.
All coreference indices are average overlap between
sentence pairs, with overlap for each pair being either 0.0
or 1.0. Weighted versions are also adjusted for distance: the
weight for each pair is the inverse of the distance between
two sentences.
Table 2 indicates that all of the indices showed
significant differences between the high and low-cohesion
texts (all p <.001). We examined whether there were
differences between index type, distance, and weighting

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
Previous studies have used LSA to measure cohesion
differences (e.g., Foltz, Kintsch, Landauer, 1998). CohMetrix includes six types of LSA indices: adjacent sentence
to sentence, sentence to all other sentences, sentence to
paragraph, sentence to text, paragraph to paragraph,
paragraph to text. Four of the six LSA indices showed
significantly higher cohesion scores for the high as
compared to the low-cohesion versions. They are: adjacent
sentence to sentence, F(1,18)=15.9, p <.01; sentence to all
sentences, F(1,18)=9.24; sentence to paragraph,
F(1,18)=12.28, p<.01; and sentence to text, F(1,18)=8.85.
The two that did not are indices of global cohesion
(paragraph to paragraph, paragraph to text), which was
generally not manipulated in the targeted studies.

It is notable that the LSA indices did not distinguish
between the text versions as well as did the coreference
indices (showing smaller effect sizes). One difference
between the coreference indices and the LSA indices is that
LSA is more generous in its determination of overlap. That
is, a concept in a sentence is more likely to overlap with a
concept in another sentence according to LSA even when
there is no strict overlap in word. This trend is also
observed amongst the coreference indices where the noun
overlap indices tended to yielded greater differences than
the stem overlap indices. Thus, the indices with the strictest
indices of overlap tend to show greater differences between
versions.

Coh-Metrix provides additional indices of causal
cohesion by measuring the ratio of the incidence of causal
particles to causal verbs (i.e., causal particles/(causal
verbs+1). Causal verbs convey an action that impacts
another entity such as the verb impact. Causal particles
include causal connectives (e.g., because) as well as
identified phrases that indicate causality such as the
adverbial phrase as a result. This index is motivated by the
assumption that causal cohesion is most relevant when the
text refers to events and actions that involve causality. CohMetrix estimates causality in a text by the number of causal
verbs conveying an action that impacts another entity. It is
assumed that causal particles clarify the intended meaning
of a causal verb. The notion is that a text that is entirely
causally cohesive will provide one causal particle for every
causal verb. If there are numerous causal verbs without
causal particles, then the reader needs to infer the
relationships between causal events/actions conveyed by
each sentence.
The results indicate that the higher cohesion texts
contained more causal particles, F(1,18)=5.60, and positive
causal connectives, F(1,18)=5.48, and that the ratio of
causal particles to verbs was greater, F(1,18)=10.69.
However, there were no differences in the other types of
connectives between the texts.
One consideration is that not all of the targeted studies
intended to vary causal cohesion. Greater differences may
emerge by targeting only those studies that explicitly
included causal manipulations. Fourteen of the text pairs
contained explicit causal cohesion manipulations. Five text
pairs from four studies were identified that did not
manipulate causal cohesion (Britton & Gulgoz, 1991;
Cataldo & Oakhill, 2000; Kintsch, 1990; Lehman &
Schraw, 2002). The interaction of cohesion and the type of
study was reliable for only one index, the ratio of causal
particles to causal verbs, F(1,18)=13.43, p=.002. This
interaction indicates that there is no difference between the
high and low-cohesion versions that did not explicitly vary
causal cohesion (F<2), whereas the difference is quite large
(Diff=0.41) for those that did, F(1,13)=26.26 (Mlow=0.80,
SDlow=0.41, Mhigh=1.21, SDhigh=0.51). This result
strengthens the conclusion that the ratio index is a
successful proxy for causal cohesion.

Connectives and Causal Cohesion
Another element of text cohesion comes from
connectives. Connectives provide explicit cues to the type
of relationship between ideas in a text, and thus increase
text cohesion (Louwerse, 2001). Coh-Metrix provides an
incidence score (occurrence per 1000 words) for four
general types of connectives: causal (negative, positive),
additive (negative, positive), temporal (negative, positive),
and clarification. Examples of each are provided in Table 4.

Discussion
One purpose of this study was to validate Coh-Metrix
(Graesser et al., 2004) as a tool to measure text cohesion. A
second purpose was to provide a description of what
aspects of text features were associated with changes in text
cohesion, when that change was made intentionally.
The results showed that the largest differences between
the text versions were found in coreference indices. Among
the coreference indices, the most discriminative were the
more local indices that include 2 or 3 sentences prior to the
target sentence. Adjacent and all distance indices tended to
yield smaller differences. There was also a trend such that
noun overlap indices, the strictest measures, tended to yield
larger differences than argument or stem overlap indices.

Likewise, although the LSA indices discriminated between
text versions, the differences were smaller compared to the
coreference indices. One reason may be because the
compared texts were on the same topics. That is, the texts
were high and low-cohesion versions of the same text.
Given that LSA is designed to represent semantic
similarity, the smaller differences shown by LSA may
reflect the fact that the texts were highly similar
semantically.
The text versions also differed in terms of causal
particles, positive causal connectives, and the ratio of
causal particles to causal verbs. Of particular interest to us
was the ratio index. This study confirmed that the ratio
successfully distinguished between high and low-cohesion
texts, particularly when causal cohesion was manipulated
in the texts. Thus, the results validate the causal ratio index.
One potential concern for this study is that low and highcohesion texts are not in equal length. In general, increasing
the cohesion of a text necessarily requires adding words;
thus this has been a confound in most studies of cohesion.
To somewhat alleviate that concern here, we truncated the
high-cohesion texts to be equal in length to the lowcohesion texts. We found that the results and trends were
generally equivalent to those that we reported here.
Overall this study validates the coreference and causal
indices by showing that Coh-Metrix successfully detects
cohesion manipulations intentionally made by experts in
text comprehension. The high-cohesion texts were
significantly different from the low-cohesion texts in
conceptual overlap and causal cohesion. In contrast, more
traditional indices of text difficulty, that is, the FleschKincaid Grade level, incorrectly indicated that the highcohesion text was more difficult or equally difficult,
respectively. These results collectively indicate that more
robust indices of text difficulty will emerge from the
consideration of text cohesion.
Computational measures of cohesion are beneficial for
several reasons. First, such computational indices, when
compared to psychological data, may shed light on
components involved in discourse processing. Second, such
indices are useful in a variety of computational
applications, including intelligent systems, summarization
techniques, text generation, speech recognition, and
question answering systems. As such, validating the
cohesion indices provided in Coh-Metrix contributes to a
large array of potential applications, both theoretical and
practical.
