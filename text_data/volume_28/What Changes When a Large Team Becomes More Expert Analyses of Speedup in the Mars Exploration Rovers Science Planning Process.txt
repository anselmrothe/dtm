Hypothesis 7: Available resources (power) decrease
A systematic decrease in resources can affect the planning
process because fewer activities could be planned each sol,
which would take less time. Each sol the mission tracked the
projected power cost of the plan developed, the power
remaining from the previous day, and the projected power
accumulation from the solar panels.
   The results show a strong correlation. Over time, the
amount of available power decreased for both missions by
approximately 35% in a fairly regular and gradual fashion
(MER A = .99, MER B = .91). Available power decreased
over the course of the mission as the seasons changed and it
became winter on Mars (shorter days, lower temperatures,
etc.). By itself this factor is somewhat inconclusive. Though
there was less power over time and this may have                   Figure 2. Percentage of work done collaboratively on
