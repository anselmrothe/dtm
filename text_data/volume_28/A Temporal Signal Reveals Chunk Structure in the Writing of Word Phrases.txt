economical and relatively simple to use, but provides high
sampling rates and spatial resolution that yield accurate and
precise raw data in electronic form. Much of the initial
extraction, analysis and coding of such digitally recorded
writing and drawing actions can be done automatically with
computer tools (although current tools are research
prototypes). More importantly, however, graphical protocol
analysis advocates the analysis of the production of
continuous sequences of relatively long stimuli comprising
multiple chunks. This permits relatively naturalistic drawing
and writing tasks to be used even in an experimental context.
Further, the density of data per trial can also be higher as each
stimulus may contain multiple hierarchically structured
chunks. In the case of the present experiment, phrases of five
or six words, of up to six letters each, were used.
Our previous experiments using graphical protocol
analysis revealed that there is a clear and substantial temporal
signal that can be used to distinguish intra- and inter-chunk
elements. This signal was found in the drawing of simple
geometrical figures (Cheng, et al., 2001) and the writing of
sequences of numbers (Cheng & Rojas-Anaya, 2005). The
chunk structure of the stimuli was predefined and learned by
the participants; induced in memory. The pause between the
end of drawing/writing of one element and the beginning of
the production of the next – the time the pen is lifted from the
graphics tablet – is substantially shorter for elements within a
chunk than for an element that begins a new chunk. For the
geometric drawings the within and between chunk pause
durations were approximately 410 and 620 ms, respectively,
and for the written number sequences the pauses were
approximately 280 and 440 ms, respectively.
(The
differences in durations between the tasks can in part be
attributed to the greater distance the pen is moved between
elements in the drawing task).
Graphical protocol analysis differs in a number of ways
from previous work that uses handwriting to study chunkbased phenomena. Other approaches have typically used the
response latency paradigm (e.g., Lochy, Pillon, Zesiger, &
Seron, 2002; Hulstijn & van Galen, 1983), which focuses on
a single chunk per trial with the manipulation of the size or
complexity of the chunk between trials. Further, such studies
have been particularly concerned with the nature of prepared
motor program chunks, with reported latencies typically
under 200 ms. In contrast our studies have dealt with the
production of a succession of chunks from working memory.
The pauses between chunks in the graphical protocol studies
are at least double the latencies in the reaction times studies,

Abstract
Evidence is provided that the patterns of pauses that occur
during the process of writing simple word phrases constitute a
substantial temporal signal that reflects the structure of the
chunks in working memory. This temporal signal is apparent in
un-aggregated data for individual participants in single trials.
Five and six word phrases, with word lengths of one to six
letters were used. Pause durations were significantly longer
between chunks (words) than for elements within a chunk
(letters). Longer chunks, words with more letters, required
significantly longer to process before they are written, and there
is a trend for shorter pause durations for later chunks in the
phrases. This provides a further demonstration that writing
may be an effective approach to probe the structure of chunks
in memory.

Introduction
The concept of chunks of information is fundamental to the
understanding of the processing of information by the
cognitive architecture. The notion is regularly invoked in
theories of perception, memory, thinking and motor
behaviour (e.g., Cowan, 2001; Miyake & Shah, 1999; Gobet
& Simon, 1998; Chi, Glaser, & Farr, 1988; Rosenbaum,
Hindorff & Munro, 1987). The range of tasks which can be
coherently explained in terms of chunks is impressive (e.g.,
Chase & Simon, 1973; Goodnow & Levine, 1973; Reitman,
1976; Egan & Schwartz, 1979; Vincente, 1988, Cheng,
McFadzean & Copeland, 2001). Despite the theoretical
importance of chunks to Cognitive Science, standard methods
to analyze chunks in behavioural output have limitations,
because they are laborious to use (e.g., Ericsson & Simon,
1993) or because they rely upon inferences about chunk
structures based on global task level performance measures,
such reaction times or error rates.
This paper describes an experiment that is part of a
program of research that is attempting to develop a method to
identify the structure of chunks in working memory using the
processes of writing and drawing – graphical protocol
analysis. In previous work it has been shown that there is a
distinct temporal signal that reveals whether written elements
are constituents within a chunk or at the boundary between
successive chunks (Cheng, McFadzean & Copeland, 2001;
Cheng & Rojas-Anaya, 2005). Graphical protocol analysis
appears to have several advantages over previous methods. It
exploits modern graphics tablet technology, which is not only

phrases consisting of equivalent numbers of words. The
jumbled phrases were included to test for a possible effect of
familiarity of the word phrases.

Familiar Phrases:
F1. # ALL FOR ONE ONE FOR ALL
F2. # TO BE OR NOT TO BE

Method

F3. # ONE SMALL STEP FOR A MAN

The methodology used was similar to that of Cheng & RojasAnaya (2005), so a brief account of the critical details is given
here. The ten participants were postgraduate students and
research staff at the University of Sussex. They wrote on a
graphics tablet, Wacom Intuos2®. Following familiarization
with writing on the tablet and training on a set of dummy
phrases, the participants wrote each of the twelve phrases
alternating between familiar and jumbled phrases but
otherwise in a random order. Each phrase was presented on a
card and the experimenter checked the recall accuracy by
asking each participant to recite the phrase until they were
confident that they could write it in a continuous unhesitating
manner. The phrase was then written in a horizontal row of
squares, one letter per square, whilst simultaneous reciting the
phrase again without seeing the card. A hash (#) was written
at the beginning of each phrase to ensure that the writing
process was well underway before the first letter was
generated.
Specially designed software for drawing/writing analysis,
TRACE, was used to record the writing actions, to extract the
pen positions and times, and to analyze the duration of pauses
between drawn elements (Cheng & Rojas-Anaya, 2004).

Jumbled Phrases:

J6. # ALL IS ONE I ARE

which argues that different levels of phenomena are being
address by the two approaches.
This paper continues the investigation of the scope and
reliability of graphical protocol analysis by testing whether
the temporal signal of chunks is apparent with simple word
phrases. If the signal is another manifestation of the
processing of chunks during writing, then it should be
comparable in nature and strength to that found with written
number sequences. (1) The durations of intra- and interchunk pauses should be comparable across the domains. (2)
The durations of intra- and inter-chunk pauses should not
only be significantly different but also substantially different.
(3) In the number sequence experiment the pause duration
before the beginning of a new chunk appeared to increase
with the size of the chunk (Cheng & Rojas-Anaya, 2005). A
similar pattern should be found with the word phrases.
As in the previous studies, the approach was first to
induce a given chunk structure into working memory using
stimuli with a predefined hierarchical structure and then to
examine whether the patterns of pauses during production
corresponded to that a priori structure. Fig. 1 shows the
stimuli used in the experiment. It is assumed that: (a) a word
will correspond to a chunk in memory (level 2 - L2); (b) its
constituent letters will be its sub-chucks (L1); (c) the graphic
elements, distinct written strokes, will be sub-sub-chunks of
the word (L0). The first two assumptions are plausible
because the phrases contain words that are not compounds
(cf., ‘evermore’) and successive words cannot be put together
as a single meaningful word (cf. ‘man age’).
Two sets of phrases, Fig. 1, were used as stimuli: six
familiar and six jumbled (unfamiliar) phrases. The familiar
phrases were obtained by pooling phrases from websites of
common English sayings and having 10 native English
speakers rate their familiarity. The six most familiar phrases
that also met the above requirements were picked. The
jumble phrases were created by randomly selecting words
from the familiar phrases, without replacement, to make six

Results
Results will first be presented at the level of individual trials
and then proceed towards more global analysis that covers
data pooled across participant and phrases. Therefore,
particular terms are introduced to help refer to the different
levels of aggregation of the data. Data for an individualphrase covers a single trial, consisting of one written phrase
by one participant. Each participant produced twelve such
individual-phrases (6 familiar and 6 jumbled), giving a total
of 120 in the experiment. A participant set of data covers all
of the 12 phrases written by one participant. There were ten
such sets in the experiment. A phrase set of data covers all
10 participants writing the same phrase.
TRACE calculates the pauses between all of the
elements. Each of the marks made were coded as being an
element within a letter (L0), as a letter within a word (L1), or
as the first letter of a word or chunk (L2). Median and nonparametric statistics were used for the analyses as data for
chunking production behaviours is often skewed. L0 pauses
were relatively rare and so are not considered here.

Patterns in individual-phrase data (single trials)
A screen snap shot from the TRACE graphical recording and
analysis program, for the writing of the familiar phrase F2 by
one participant, is shown in Fig. 2.
The small circles superimposed on each written letter
indicate the beginning and end of the production of elements
in those letters as the pen touches or leaves the paper. The

sense of the closeness of the match between the expected
chunk structure and the durations of the pauses can be judged
by visually comparing the shape of the solid and dashed lines
(not their absolute magnitudes). For both familiar and
unfamiliar phrases, the pauses with the greatest magnitudes
typically occur at the beginning of a chunk (new word),
which suggests that the pattern of pauses is due to the chunk
structure given by the words in the phrase.
The graphs shown in Fig. 3 have not been specially
selected but are representative of all the individual-phrase
graphs. It is noteworthy that the temporal signal reflecting
the individual word structure of the phrases is apparent at this
single trial level before any aggregation of the data.

lines between elements indicate transitions where the pen is
off the paper. Note the two pairs of dots on the letters ‘T’ and
‘E’ as they were written in two parts. Hence, there will be a
within letter (L0) pause associated with each of those letters.
The distance between letters is comparable for letters with
and between words.
Fig. 3 shows two graphs of the sequence of pause
durations for the same participant writing phrases F2 and J3.
The solid line gives the pause durations. The dashed line
(arbitrary units) indicates the expected chunk level, whether it
is an inter-chunk L2 data point (100 units), an intra-chunk L1
point (50 units), or a within letter L0 data point (zero units).
The letters forming the sequence are shown along the dashed
line (with each letter aligned to its respective data point). A

values or the difference between L1 and L2. In the
subsequent analyses the data for all the phrases are pooled
across the two familiarity conditions.

Intra- and inter-chunk pause durations
For each individual-phrase, the medians of the L1 (within
word/chunk) and L2 (between word/chunk) pauses were
computed. Then participant medians were computed (i.e., the
median of all the individual-phrase medians for each
participant). These are shown in Table 1, along with the
difference between the two levels (L2-L1). For every phrase
across all the participants the median of the intra-chunk pause
duration was less than the inter-chunk pause duration, for
both familiarity conditions. To test whether the differences
between L1 and L2 pauses were significant, Mann-Whitney
U was for computed for each participant median. The
number of phrases for each participant where the difference
was significant at p<.05 is also shown Table 1. Of the 60
familiar individual-phrases, this difference was significant for
39 of the cases (65%). Of the 60 jumbled individual-phrases,
this difference was significant for 37 of the cases (62%).
Overall, the magnitude of L2 pauses for the familiar
phrases was 45% greater than the L1 pauses, and similarly
48% greater for jumbled phrases. The mean difference
between the levels was 126 ms or 125 ms for the two
conditions, respectively. Comparisons of the L1 and L2
participant medians (rows in Table 1) using one-tail t tests,
shows that, for both the familiar and unfamiliar phrases, the
difference was significant at the p<.001 level.
It is worth noting that although participant DR has a low
L2-L1 (see Table 1), inspection of Fig. 3 shows that the
pattern of pauses and the imposed chunk structure are
comparable. The temporal signature of the chunks is more
noticeable in the graphs of the other participants who have a
larger difference between the L1 and L2 levels.
Contrary to expectation there is no difference between
familiar and jumbled phrases in terms of their absolute pause

Effect of chunk length and position in phrase
The words of all phrases were classified according to chunk
length – 1 to 6 letters long; and according to their position in
a phrase – the 1st to the 6th word in a phrase. The median of
L2 pauses for words with the same chunk length and position
in phrases are shown in Table 2a. The values are medians of
all L2 values pooled across all phrases and all participants.

significantly longer than intra-chunk (L1) pauses. The
duration of L2 pauses was about 50% greater than the L1
pauses. Overall, this is consistent with our previous studies,
in which the same temporal signal in writing and drawing has
been shown to reveal chunk structure in memory (Cheng, et
al., 2001, Cheng & Rojas-Anaya, 2005).
All together, this demonstrates that graphical protocol
analysis has some potential as means to study chunk-based
cognitive phenomena. The approach allows relatively long
stimuli to be used, the phrases had five or six words and up
21 letters, which gives a good density of data per trial. The
initial processing of data and the extraction of pause durations
was done largely automatically by the TRACE tool.
Although real words and familiar phrases were used, the
judicious choice of words and phrases appears to have been
successful in producing a consistent induced structure of
chunks in the memory of the participants. A basis has now
been established for exploring the use of the method, in
reverse, to infer the structure of chunks from the patterns of
pauses for words and phrases that are more complex.
The mean intra-chunk pauses were about 270 ms and the
mean inter-chunk pauses were about 400 ms, for both the
familiar and unfamiliar word phrases. These magnitudes are
comparable to the within and between chunk pauses found in
the previous experiment using number sequences (Cheng &
Rojas-Anaya, 2005). Those L1 and L2 pauses were 280 and
440 ms, respectively. Further, the suggested increase in interchunk pause duration with larger chunks in the number
sequences was also found with the word phrases, but this time
the increase with each additional letter was significant.
Overall, this argues that the writing of number sequences and
word phrases is likely to share similar chunk processing
mechanisms.
The magnitudes of the inter-chunk pause durations (400+
ms), contrasts with studies of writing that focus on
programmed motor behaviour (e.g., Lochy, Pillon, Zesiger, &
Seron, 2002; Hulstijn & van Galen, 1983). In those studies,
the reaction time for the production of a chunk is no greater
than 200 ms, which is also less than the present L1 intrachunk pause. This supports the view that the current
approach is concerned with different, or additional, process
compared to those earlier studies. A major difference in the
current approach is the successive production of multiple
chunks, rather than a one-off reaction time. Hence, it is
hypothesized that the longer durations may also incorporate

For example, the cell at the coordinates (2, 3) in the Table has
a median of 344 ms for both of the two-letter words that were
in the 3rd position within all phrases, which includes ‘OR’ in
F2, and ‘TO’ in J4. Empty cells in Table 2a and 2b means
that no words of the given length and position occur among
the stimuli.
On initial inspection, Table 2 shows a general trend of L2
pauses increasing with chunk length and decreasing with
position in phrase. Table 3 quantifies the increase with chunk
length by showing change in L2 values for words differing in
length by one letter, for fixed positions in phrases. In Table 3
‘1-2’ denotes the transition from 1 to 2 letters, ‘2-3’ from 2 to
3 letters, and so forth. Positive values indicate that, for a
specific position in phrase, the L2 medians have increased,
whereas negative values indicate a decrement in L2 medians.
Table 3 shows a preponderance of increases in L2 values,
indicated by the low proportion of negative changes; 3 out of
16. If it is assumed that it is equally likely that the values
may increase or decrease (p=0.5), then by the binomial
theorem the probability that at least 3 out of 16 values are
decreasing is p=.01. Hence, an increase in the length of a
word will result in an increase in the pause duration at the
beginning of the word. The mean increase in Table 3 is 25
ms; in other words, adding an extra letter to a chunk will
require an additional 25 ms to process the chunk before the
word can begin to be written.
In a similar way, Table 4 examines the change in L2
medians of pause durations for successive positions of words
in a phrase, with the chunk length kept constant. There are 14
cases where there are words of the same length in consecutive
positions. Ten of those cases have decreasing pause
durations: the remainder increasing. The average decrease is
16 ms per position. Assuming again that the chance of
increasing or decreasing values are equal, then the binomial
theorem probability of having up to 4 positive changes out of
14 is p=.09. Hence, although there appears to be a trend for a
decreasing pause duration the later a word occurs in a phrase,
the reliability of this finding must be treated with caution.

Discussion
In the context of simple word phrases, this experiment
provides further evidence for the existence of a strong and
robust temporal signal that reveals the structure of chunks in
memory as pattern in the durations of pauses between written
elements. In the majority of trials, with individuals writing a
single phrase, the duration of inter-chunk (L2) pauses was

processes that prepare chunks in working memory, prior to
the programming of motor actions.
The lack of an effect of the jumbled versus familiar
phrases is initially surprising, but in hindsight also
theoretically explicable. Although familiarity often has an
affect in many tasks, its absence here may be due to the
specific experimental procedure that required participants to
verbally rehearse a jumbled phrase. This may have made the
words in the jumbled phrase as active in memory as the
words in a familiar phrase, which sees to have required less
repetition. The extra immediate processing of the jumbled
phrase could compensate for its lack of presence in long-term
memory. The lack of an effect is interesting, as it suggests,
tentatively, that the temporal signal in this experiment largely
reflects processing associated with working memory. This is
an issue for further investigation.
Graphical protocol analysis relies fundamentally on the
idea that the pause durations between written elements
meaningfully reflect the structure of chunks in memory and is
somehow due to the internal processing of the chunks. An
alternative explanation is that the longer pauses are caused by
the time needed for participants to physically move their
hand, which may happen at the boundary between chunks
rather than between elements within a chunk. This is an issue
we are currently investigating using video recordings of the
participants as they wrote the phrases. Preliminary analysis
indicates that such movements are not strongly associated
with transitions between words. Hence, the occurrence of
physical movements is likely to be detrimental to the
temporal chunk signals as a source of noise, rather than as a
challenge to the underlying basis of the approach.
