Syntactic and Causal Constraints on the Necessity of Conditional Inferences
by Readers

Abstract
The data of three experiments (Campion, in press) confirm
that the readers of texts including conditional arguments
process the conditional syntax as an asymmetric constraint
which warrants the Modus Ponens, a logically valid
inference. However, causal knowledge can raise doubt about
that inference and warrant the validity of the reciprocal
inference (Affirmation of the Consequent). Thus, according
to the theory of natural logic, the readers can make formal
deductions, such as the modus Ponens. However, the
readers also reason on causal bases and a formal deduction
must not contradict knowledge about causality in the world.
This provides further evidence that readers can represent
their inferences as hypotheses (Campion, 2004).
Logically valid deductions are made during text
comprehension (Campion, 2004; Rader and Sloutsky, 2002;
Lea, O’Brien, Fisch, Braine and Noveck, 1990; Lea, 1995).
What is controversial is whether these inferences reflect the
readers’ ability to draw formal deductions from text
propositions. According to the mental or natural logic
theory (Braine, 1978; Braine & O'Brien, 1991), the adults
possess a set of mental rules that correspond to inference
schemas and lead to make logically correct deductions.
According to Rader and Sloutsky (2002), the mental model
theory (Johnson-Laird, 1983. Johnson-Laird et Byrne, 2002)
gives a better account of the deductions made when reading
conditional arguments in texts. In support of that view, they
used short stories with a conditional premise of the form: if
antecedent then consequent (e.g., “If it is night, then it is
cold outside”). A subsequent premise either affirmed the
antecedent (e.g., “it is night”), and therefore elicited a
Modus Ponens (MP) inference (e.g., “it is cold outside”), or
affirmed the consequent (e.g., “it is cold outside”), and
therefore elicited an affirmation of the consequent (AC)
inference (e.g., “it is night”).
AC inferences do not correspond to logically-valid
deductions. However, Rader & Sloutsky (2002) found that
the AC and MP inferences were both activated by the
readers of their texts and were then both recognized with a
same frequency as paraphrases of the text information. As
pointed out by Rader & Sloutsky, these findings do not
support the natural logic theory because no inference
schema corresponds to AC inferences in the theory, in
contrast to MP inferences that should be favored. In
contrast, the findings support the mental model theory
which stipulates that only one model is normally
constructed to represent the meaning of a conditional
premise. Building more models would be made when the

conditional meanings need to be exhaustively represented,
and reading a text for comprehension does not require these
additional models. Consequently, readers would not build
the additional model that falsifies the AC inferences, and the
AC and MP inferences of readers would be represented as
identical.
The first aim of this study was to investigate whether
readers represent their AC inferences as hypothetical facts,
and therefore distinguish them from their MP inferences,
that they represent as facts that are certain. A previous study
(Campion, 2004) supported a similar claim: the readers
would represent their deductions from categorical
syllogisms as facts that are certain, while they represent the
predictions they make about what should happen next in the
story as hypotheses.
In agreement with that view, I suggest that AC inferences
might be hypothetical inferences. Readers would draw the
AC inferences, because they are the relevant conclusions of
AC arguments, but would represent them as hypotheses,
because they are not constrained by the conditional syntax.
A complementary assumption is that the readers would
represent the MP inferences as certain facts, because they
are syntactically constrained by the text.
This study also examined the impact of readers' worldknowledge on the AC and MP inferences that involve causal
relations between events. The existence of that impact has
already been demonstrated in studies of reasoning. Thus,
alternative causes prevent certainty responses to AC
inferences from a causal conditional: “If cause then effect”.
For example, the conditional premise: “If a dog has a skin
disease, then it will scratch constantly”, leads to few
certainty responses to AC inferences, presumably because
the alternative cause “ a dog has fleas” can be easily
retrieved from knowledge about dogs. (Barrouillet,
Markovits and Quinn, 2001; Cummins, 1995; Markovits
and Quinn, 2002).
Similarly, reading conditional arguments would
automatically activate the corresponding causal knowledge
in readers Long-term memory (Campion & Rossi, 2001;
Kintsch, 1998) and should invite the readers to check the
compatibility of the conditional meaning with the
underlying causal knowledge about the events in conditional
relation (Singer, Halldorson, Lear, Andrusiak, 1992; van
den Broek, 1990). However, if we assume that the
conditional syntax constrains the making of MP inferences
that are certain, world-knowledge should have a limited
impact on the representation of MP inferences by readers. In
contrast, AC inferences are not syntactically constrained,
and their hypothetical or certain status will be heavily
dependent on world-knowledge.

whereas for the second set of conditionals, the truth
frequencies recorded for the premises in the forward
direction were not so different from those recorded in the
reverse direction (4.8 vs 5.2). The corresponding interaction
was significant (F1(1, 11) = 43.28, MSE = .0141, p < .001;
F2(1, 46) = 28.61, MSE = 0.419, p < .001)

Experiment 1
The aim of this experiment was to establish that readers do
not confuse their representation of AC and MP inferences
when both the conditional syntax and their worldknowledge constrain the MP inference direction. The text
should represent the AC inference as hypothetical, whereas
the MP inferences should be represented as certain. The
conditional premises were therefore written in the forward
direction, and the involved causes were strongly sufficient
and weakly necessary for the effects. For example, “If
someone drinks too much coffee before going to bed, then
he doesn’t sleep”.

Method

A = Claude went for a long ride on Caramel and the pony
remained calm.
B = ** (Perhaps) Claude talked to Caramel all the time **

Participants. The participants were 32 students from the
University of Paris X who had not studied logic. They took
part in the experiment on a voluntarily basis.
Materials. The twenty-four experimental texts were short
narratives, and their last two sentences expressed a
conditional argument in the AC or MP form (see Table 1).
The first sentences in the arguments were the conditionals
written in the forward direction, with a strongly sufficient
and weakly necessary cause, as established in the former
control study. Care was taken that the truth of the
conditional inferences only depend on the argument form
and world-knowledge, but was independent from the other
story events. The entire texts consisted of about 80 words in
4 to 7 sentences. There were also eight filler texts.
Twenty-four judgment probes expressed the events to be
inferred. A hypothetical version of these probes was created
by adding the adverb “peut-être”, a French word meaning
“maybe”. Each of these probes was followed by a second
filler probe, which also involved text information, but was
unrelated to the inference and could call for the answer
“false”. Otherwise, the eight filler texts were followed by
two filler probes, the first of which was always false.
Finally, the participants were expected to answer “false” to
47% of the probes.
Procedure. The participants worked individually in a
session that lasted approximately 30 minutes. The texts
were read sentence by sentence from the middle of a
computer screen. When they had read a text sentence, the
participants pressed the space bar and it was replaced by the
next sentence. When the last text sentence had disappeared
from the screen, a row of asterisks was displayed for 500 ms
in the middle of the screen and was then replaced by the
first probe, which was displayed with asterisks on each side
of it. The second probe was presented in the same way. The
participants were instructed to press the "true" key when the
information expressed in the probe was true according to the
text and to press the "false" key otherwise. The "True/False"

The Two Sets of Conditionals
Two set of twenty-four cause-effect pairs were selected.
In the first set, the causes were strongly sufficient but
weakly necessary for the effects, whereas they were only
moderately necessary and sufficient for the effects in the
second set. Forward and reverse conditionals were written
by placing the cause of each pair in the antecedent or
consequent position. (see Table 1). Twelve judges evaluated
the truth frequency of the forward and reverse conditionals
on a 8-point scale with the value 1 corresponding to “never
true”. For the first set of conditionals, the truth frequencies
were much higher for the premises in the forward direction
(6.4) than the premises in the reverse direction (5.2),

top line of letters on a French “azerty keyboard), with the
"true" key corresponding to the preferred hand of the
participants. The signal “new text” then appeared on the

comparisons indicated that the affirmative probes were more
rapidly accepted as true than the hypothetical ones for MP

screen, and a press on the space bar was required to bring up
the new text. The participants were told that their response
times were being recorded, and were asked to answer
quickly. No feedback was given to the participants about
their answers. The participants underwent a training phase
before they began the experiment proper. A training text and
two probes were presented following the same procedure as
for the rest of the experiment. The participants were then
trained quickly to select the "True/False" keys. The words
"Vrai" (true) and "Faux" (false) were successively presented
in the middle of the screen, in a random order, and the
participants answered with the appropriate keys. Fourteen
responses were required during the training phase, and any
errors were pointed out by an appropriate message.

Results and Discussion
Acceptance rates. The mean rate of the errors made by the
participants in response to the filler probes (i.e., the second
probe following the experimental texts, and the two probes
that followed the filler texts) was 13.3% (SE = 0.46), which
attested that the stories were being read attentively. The
acceptance percentages of the inference probes are shown in
Table 2. They provided a first indication that the readers
discriminated between the MP and AC inferences they drew
from the texts. The percentage of affirmative probes
accepted as true was significantly higher for MP inferences
(89%) than for AC inferences (69%). (F1(1, 31) = 10.92,
MSE = .0396, p < .01; F2(1, 23) = 11.66, MSE = .0268, p <
.01).
Acceptance latencies. The acceptance latencies of the
inference probes are shown in Table 2. A two-factor
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures
indicated that inference types had an effect (F1(1, 31) =
43.08, MSE = 111920, p < .01; F2(1, 23) = 33.73, MSE =
3616576, p < .01), that the probe type had no significant
effect (p > .7), and that there was a significant interaction
between these factors (F1(1, 31) = 6.59, MSE = 339666, p <

effect was significant for AC inferences (F1(1, 31) = 4.2,
MSE = 310202, p < .05; F2(1, 23) = 4.23, MSE = 230712, p
< .052).
According to these findings, the readers' representations of
MP inferences were closer in meaning to the affirmative
probes than to the hypothetical probes. The reverse was true
for the readers’ representation of AC inferences. Thus, the
readers discriminated between the AC and MP inferences:
they represented the AC inferences as being hypothetical,
and the MP inferences as being certain.

Experiment 2
The results of Experiment 1 do not make it possible to
distinguish between the respective roles of the conditional
syntax and world knowledge in constraining inference
representations. The aim of this experiment was to find out
whether the presence of a strongly sufficient and weakly
necessary cause would lead the reader to be more confident
about their world-knowledge than about the conditional
syntax. Thus, the conditionals used in Experiment 1 were
presented in the reverse direction: “If effect then cause”.
This reversion should have a limited impact if the processes
involved in AC and MP inferences are determined
predominantly by the conditional syntax.

Method

Participants. The participants were 32 students from the
University of Paris X who had not studied logic. They took
part in the experiment on a voluntary basis.
Materials, procedures and design. They were the same as
those of Experiment 1, except that the major premises were
written in the reverse order: “If effect, then cause”. (see
Table 1).

Results and Discussion
The mean of the participants errors in response to filler
probes was 15.5% (SE = 0.42), which demonstrated that the
stories were read attentively. The acceptance percentages
and latencies of probes are shown in Table 3. No interesting
effect could be found in the acceptance rates. For the
acceptance latencies, a two-factor analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with repeated measures indicated a significant
main effect of probe type (F1(1, 31) = 4.74, MSE = 189025,
p < .05; F2(1, 23) = 4.06, MSE = 165801, p < .056), no
main effect of inference type (p >.7), but a trend for a
interaction between the inference and probe types, although
it was only near significant with items as the random
variable (F1(1, 31) = 1.62, MSE = 358813, p < .22; F2(1,
23) = 3.42, MSE = 127541, p < .08)).
In sum, these findings indicate that the AC inferences
were represented as being closer in meaning to the certain
probes than to the hypothetical probes. In contrast, the MP
inferences were generally represented as being equally
compatible in meaning to the certain or the hypothetical
probes. Thus, in agreement with the hypothesis that AC
inferences are knowledge-based, the present data indicated
that when AC inferences involve the effect of a strongly
sufficient cause, they are represented as certain facts. The
present data also demonstrate that the readers’ knowledge
can cast doubt on the certainty of MP inferences, despite the
conditional syntax. In this experiment, the MP inferences
required the readers to conclude that a weakly necessary
cause is true, and the readers were presumably able to assess
this lack of necessity, possibly by retrieving some
alternative causes that could produce the same effect.

arguments, the new conditionals were written in the forward
direction: “ If cause then effect”. As a result of that reversal,
the AC and MP inferences both involved inferring the same
causes from the same effects. Therefore, whatever the
impact of world-knowledge, it was presumably identical for

both inference types. In particular, the same counterexamples could decrease the certainty of the AC and MP
inferences. A new set of affirmative and hypothetical probes
replaced those used in Experiments 1 and 2, and the filler
probes remained unchanged.
Procedure. It was the same procedure as that used in
Experiment 1, except that at the end of the entire
experiment, each participant performed an unexpected
Wason task.

Results and Discussion

Experiment 3

The participants’ mean error rate to the filler probes was
13.1% (SE = 0.6), which confirmed that the stories were
being read attentively. The acceptance percentages and
latencies of probes are shown in Table 4. The acceptance
rates did not differ significantly across the experimental
conditions. The acceptance latencies of the inference probes
are reported in Table 4. A two-factor analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with repeated measures indicated that inference
had no main effect (p >.3), probe type had no significant
effect (p > .1), but that there was a significant interaction
between these factors (F1(1, 31) = 5.82, MSE = 133001, p <
.022; F2(1, 23) = 4.06, MSE = 142877, p <.056). In
agreement with predictions, the planned comparisons
indicated that the affirmative probes were indeed more
rapidly accepted as true than the hypothetical ones for MP
inferences (F1(1, 31) = 8.47, MSE = 155305, p < .01; F2(1,
23) = 11.19, MSE = 88215, p < .01). For the AC inferences,
the mean acceptance latencies for the affirmative and
hypothetical probes were nearly equal.
According to these data, the MP inferences were closer in
meaning to the affirmative probes than to the hypothetical
ones, whereas the meaning of AC inferences was
compatible with both the hypothetical and certain probes.
These findings suggest that MP inferences were represented

The aim of this experiment was to show that readers can
represent MP inferences as necessary because they are
constrained to do so by the conditional syntax. Therefore,
the conditional premises were cause-effect pairs of moderate
strength, the cause being neither strongly sufficient nor
weakly necessary for the effect.

Method
Participants. The participants were 32 students from the
University of Paris X who had not studied logic. They took
part in the experiment on a voluntary basis. None of them
successfully passed a Wason task, unlike three students who
were replaced.
Material. The texts of this experiment were the same as
those used in Experiments 1 and 2, except for the two last
sentences, which were replaced by new conditional
arguments (see Table 1). The new conditional premises
expressed causally-related events and, as in the control
study, the cause was of moderate strength. In comparison to
the cause-effect pairs used in Experiment 1 and 2 , the new
cause-effect pairs could be considered to be more necessary
and less sufficient for the effect. For the MP arguments, the
new conditional premises were written in the reverse
direction: “If effect then cause”. Conversely, for the AC
1077

as certain facts by readers, whereas the AC inferences were
represented as hypotheses about the text.
In Experiment 3, causal knowledge could not be used to
distinguish the conditional inferences, so it must have been
the processing of the conditional syntax that constrained the
readers to represent their MP inferences as certain. The data
also confirm that, without the support of a conditional
premise that syntactically warrants their validity, the
certainty of AC inferences is entirely determined by the
causal strength with which the conditional consequent
allows the readers to conclude to the conditional
consequent, according to their world-knowledge about the
underlying events. In Experiment 3, the conditional
consequent entailed the conditional antecedent as a cause
that was not necessary but probable, and readers considered
the AC inferences to be hypothetical.

General Discussion
This study first supports the conclusion that for readers
who are not experts in logical processes, the conditional
syntax acts as an asymmetric constraint, but they also
consider their causal knowledge about the conditional
events. In addition, the syntactic and causal characteristics
of the conditional arguments were shown to result in AC
and MP inferences that varied depending on the certain or
hypothetical status of their representations. Therefore,
whereas a previous study had demonstrated that AC and MP
inferences were drawn during reading (Rader & Sloutsky,
2002), the present study indicates that these inferences will
not be systematically identical in the readers’ representation
of the situation described in the text.
Taken together, the results of these experiments support
the conclusion that both the conditional syntax and the
readers’ causal knowledge determine the conditional
inferences made by readers. Processing the conditional
syntax instructs the readers about the logical legacy of MP
inferences, whereas the sentence comprehension involves
associative processes, and makes it possible to retrieve
causal knowledge about the events in a conditional
relationship. The strength of the causal relations involved
would be evaluated, as for any pair of text events (Singer,
Hallordson & Andrusiak, 1992; van den Broek, 1990). That
causal evaluation would be a automatic process when the
activated knowledge match the causal relation implied by
the text events. The outcome would be the acceptance or
rejection of the conditional instruction as warranting the MP
inferences. Thus, MP inferences would be always conceived
as syntactically constrained, but they would be only
represented as certain if the underlying knowledge remains
compatible with the syntactic instruction provided by the
conditional premise. In the case of AC inferences, the
mention of the conditional consequent in the minor premise
would invite the readers to infer the conditional antecedent.
However, since these inferences are not syntactically
constrained, their representation as certain or hypothetical
would depend purely on the assessment of the strength of
the underlying causal relations. The impact of causal

knowledge on the processing of AC inferences would
therefore be central and exclusive, in contrast with the
situation for MP inferences, where the conditional syntax
intervenes.
With regard to the impact of causal knowledge on MP
inferences, it is important to note that, according to the
findings of Experiment 3, the weakness of the same causal
relationship was not sufficient to prevent the drawing of
certain MP inferences, although it did prevent the certainty
of AC inferences. This finding clearly suggests that the
conditional syntax constrains the MP inferences and take
precedence over the readers causal knowledge. The results
of experiment 2 do not contradict that finding but show that
there is generally a limit to readers’ loyalty to the
conditional syntax. Accordingly, when their causal
knowledge clearly contradict the conditional relations,
making the MP inferences rather absurd, the readers are
finally uncertain about their MP inferences, and represent
them as hypotheses.
The contribution of the conditional syntax to conditional
inferences by readers has implications for applying theories
of conditional reasoning to text comprehension. A mental
model account of the syntactic discrimination that, without
contradicting knowledge, readers operate between the
certainty of MP and the hypothetical nature of AC
inferences is not possible with a single mental model, even
if the model is considered hypothetical. According to
Johnson-Laird (2002), individuals normally represent the
conditional “If A then B” with a single model plus three
dots:
A
B
…
The three dots account for the fact that the individuals
keep in mind that possibilities other than the simultaneous
truth of A and B are implied by the conditional, even if
these possibilities are as yet being ignored. Thus, the three
dots can be viewed as the kind of hypothetical tag that, I
propose,
characterizes
hypothetical
inferences.
Consequently for the mental model theory, if the individuals
are then shown proposition: B, they will infer the
conclusion: A, but it will be tagged as hypothetical because
of the three dots. The issue is, however, that the same
consideration prevails for MP inferences. If the individuals
are presented with proposition A instead of proposition B,
then they will infer proposition B, and it too will be tagged
as hypothetical, because of the three dots. Therefore, the
only way that seems to allow us to provide a mental model
account of hypothetical AC inferences and certain MP
inferences would be to consider that the individuals
represent the two following models from the conditional
statement:
A
B
Not A B
…
In sum, a mental model account of the drawing of
hypothetical AC inferences and certain MP inferences
implies that readers build an additional model that

1078

represents the falsity of the conditional antecedent in
conjunction with the truth of the consequent. In theory, this
“fleshing out” process is supposed to demand effort
(Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 2002), and, according to Rader &
Sloutsky (2002), it is not compatible with text
comprehension requirements. One way of reconciling the
theory with our findings would be to suggest that alternative
models may only be represented when the conditionals
involve a causally-related event in familiar situations, or to
introduce a syntactic direction in mental models (from the
antecedent to the consequent).
The data collected for MP inferences, especially those of
Experiment 3, support the natural logic theory. According to
that theory, when a conditional of the form: “If A then B” is
encountered, it is interpreted as an explicit instruction to
infer B given A, the truth of B being warranted given A.
(Braine, 1978). The data collected in Experiment 3 support
this theoretical assumption. Accordingly, even when the MP
inference consisted in inferring a cause from its effect, and
presumably evoked some alternative causes, the MP
inferences were still represented as certain by readers.
Otherwise, by showing that readers easily draw MP
inferences and represent them as necessary entailed, the data
are compatible with the natural logic assumption that the
necessary truth of MP inferences is inherent to applying a
deductive schema.
It is worth noticing that this study also demonstrated a
limit to the readers’ loyalty to formal logic. The results of
Experiment 2 indicate that the readers may not follow the
syntactic instruction of conditional premises, and may not
represent their MP inferences as certain. When the readers’
causal knowledge does not support the validity of the
inference, and therefore prohibits a content-free usage of the
conditional syntax, the readers represent their MP inferences
as hypothetical. A possible explanation of the data collected
in Experiment 2 is that the readers experience cognitive
difficulties in activating a representation of the
asymmetrical meaning of a conditional, when it is the
reversed meaning that is strongly compatible with the causal
knowledge. Thus, in Experiment 2, the readers rapidly
confuse the exact conditional meaning with the more
appropriate meaning that they know and corresponds to the
reversed premise. Note that this account corresponds to the
observed effects, because it is a reversed interpretation of
the conditional, rather than a biconditional interpretation.
Finally, this study confirms that the readers represent
inferences that are unwarranted both by the text and by their
knowledge as hypotheses that are distinct from their
representations of necessary and certain inferences
(Campion, 2004). It also indicates that readers process the
conditional syntax in order to consider the deductions of the
MP form as necessary, but only do so when the conditionals
receive at least a partial support from their causal
knowledge.
