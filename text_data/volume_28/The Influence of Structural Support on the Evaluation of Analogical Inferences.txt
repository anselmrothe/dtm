(i.e. base) domain.            This conjecture consists of
hypothesizing the existence of relations between objects (or
other relations) in the target domain because those same
relations are known to obtain between the corresponding
objects in the base domain. Within the Structure-Mapping
Theory, the inference is executed by carrying relations from
the base to the target. Next, substitutions are made for
matching objects, and the existence of new elements in the
target may be proposed if licensed by the structure of the
base domain.
