Implicit sequence learning
The status of knowledge resulting from implicit learn-
ing is highly controversial with people claiming that hu-
man learning is systematically accompanied by aware-                   P1          P2            R1          R2
ness (Shanks & StJohn, 1994) and others claiming that
unconscious learning is a fundamental process in human
cognition (Reber, 1993). Another exponent of the latter
view is Destrebecqz, who has found a strong dissociation
between an implicit and an explicit measure of sequence                  p               p          r               r

be noted though that others have failed replicate their
