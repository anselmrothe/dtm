                      Introduction1
Over the past thirty years, researchers have used a vari-
ety of directional symbols to elicit covert visual orienting
within the context of the spatial cuing paradigm (Pos-
ner, Snyder, & Davidson, 1980). However, this research
has generally proceeded without explicit regard for the
processing constraints that the comprehension of such
symbols might place on the orientation of attention. In
this paper, we further investigate functional differences
between word cues and arrow cues and provide a com-
putational model that implies a novel, conceptually par-          Figure 1: Experimental setup (see text for explanation).

13.17, M Se = 3796.76, p < .001, for the SOA X cue type
interaction. However, the overall RT difference observed
between the word cue and arrow cue conditions never-
theless remained significant at each of the eight SOA
conditions used in the present study (p < .05 or less
for each of the eight pair-wise comparisons). Notice also
that RTs appeared to have reached asymptotic levels in
the both the word cue and arrow cue conditions; thus,
the enduring effect of cue type observed in the present
study cannot be attributed to the use of insufficiently
long SOAs. In summary, the experimental results raise
two critical questions:
   (Q1) cued location effect – why are RTs in the
above/below condition faster than in the left/right con-
dition when word cues are shown, but not when arrow
cues are shown? Previous answers to this questions have
critically involved the notion of a “reference frame” (see      Figure 3: The basic model architecture, consisting of

Simulations and Results
Given G, it is possible to systematically vary all nine
parameters (G5-G13) in order to find the values p that
result in the smallest G(p) for the given architecture.
These parameter values then define the “best model”,
i.e., the model that deviates the least from the human
data (among all the considered models). The best model
can then be used as base model in two ways: (1) as the          Figure 4: Comparison of the results from model simula-
