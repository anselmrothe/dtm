semantic information they contain. Words with many senses
would be rich in semantic features, an advantage which can
lead to more stable representations, and faster settling times
in distributed networks. The mechanisms proposed above
seem to accommodate our findings; competition between
pre-semantic word representations would lead to an
ambiguity disadvantage and would likely to be a pre-
bottleneck effect. A senses advantage operating at the level
of semantic features would result in an ambiguity
advantage, and take place at the bottleneck.
