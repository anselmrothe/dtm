Channel Attraction
A viewer’s interest in a channel continuously changes based
on information about what is shown on alternative channels.
This process basically can be viewed as a simple learning
from experience—to learn what is shown on channels and
pick the one that is interesting. Our model adopts one of the
most established and commonly used learning models in
psychology— the reinforcement learning model (Busemeyer
& Myung, 1992; Erev & Roth, 1998). Format features of
channels (in our data, pacing and story length) have
corresponding parameters and can affect the learning rate,
that is, the update of interest in a channel. The learning
process is defined as the following:
    On one hand, if channel i is watched before the k-th                 Figure 1: View durations differ for channels with different

   This equation is intuitive. If a channel is attractive and has
large strength, then the boredom grows slowly and viewers
stay on the channel longer, and if a channel is not attractive
and has small strength, then boredom grows quickly and
viewers change channels more frequently. Thus the mean of
the distribution of viewing durations is directly related to
the attractiveness and strength of the channel. As shown in           Figure 2: Viewing durations differ for viewers with different

channel 1 is less attractive and has smaller strength than
channel 2 (v1 < v2). Then, the boredom experienced while
watching channel 1 grows more quickly than while
watching channel 2. According to equation (6), the time it
takes to reach the same threshold θ are t1 = v1⋅θ for channel
1 and t2 = v2⋅θ for channel 2, which is not the same, t1 < t2,
