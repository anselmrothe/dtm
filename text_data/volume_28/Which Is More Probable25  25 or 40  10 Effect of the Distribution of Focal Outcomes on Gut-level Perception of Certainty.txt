Windschitl and coworkers emphasize that the alternativeoutcome effect does not indicate that people are necessarily
deceived or mistaken about the objective probability of a
focal event. Rather, it assumes the existence of a dissociation
between a person’s belief in the objective probability of an
outcome and his/her intuitive or “gut-level” perceptions of
certainty. In other words, variations in the distribution of
evidence across alternative outcomes can implicitly affect the
gut-level perceptions of certainty, even when the variations
do not affect the beliefs about the objective probability of the
focal outcome. Their emphasis is based on recent research on
other phenomena such as the ratio-bias phenomenon (DenesRaj & Epstein, 1994; Kirkpatrick & Epstein, 1992) or context
effects (Windschitl & Weber, 1999).
In this study, we also assume the dissociation between
the belief in the objective probability of an outcome and the
intuitive perception of certainty. Moreover, based on the
abovementioned studies, we examine a new problem of the
effect of the distribution of multiple outcomes. That is, this
study aims to investigate whether the shape of the
distribution of focal outcomes affects probability judgment.

Abstract
Previous studies reveal that the distribution of alternative
outcomes plays an important role in the probability judgment
of focal outcomes. Based on this finding, the present study
addresses the following question: does the distribution of focal
outcomes affect probability judgment? A total of 313
participants (66 in Experiment 1 and 247 in Experiment 2)
estimate fictitious results of slot machines with many winning
letters. Results of the two experiments indicate that with the
exception of a few cases, people estimate a higher probability
for focal outcomes that are distributed more uniformly.

Introduction
One of the central concerns in studies of probability
judgment is the distribution of multiple outcomes that are
related to it. A typical case of probability judgment involves
a focal outcome and alternative outcomes: the former is the
target of probability judgment, while the latter may not be the
target. For example, when people predict that “The weather
will be fine tomorrow,” there exist other possibilities of the
weather condition (cloudy, rainy, or snowy). Recent studies
have revealed that probability judgment is often sensitive to
variations in the distribution of alternative outcomes, even
when such variations are not related to the objective
probability of the focal outcome (Gonzalez & Frenck-Mestre,
1993; Teigen, 1988; Windschitl & Wells, 1998; Windschitl
& Young, 2001; Windschitl, Young, & Jensen, 2002). The
effect of the variations in the distribution of alternative
outcomes on probability judgment is referred to as the
alternative-outcome effect.
The study of Windschitl and Wells (1998) clearly
demonstrated the alternative-outcome effect. In one of their
experiments, 21 raffle tickets were distributed to participants
and they were asked to estimate their probability of winning
the raffle. In the first scenario, 5 other raffle players
possessed 14, 13, 15, 12, and 13 tickets, while in the second,
they possessed 52, 6, 2, 2, and 5 tickets. Although the
objective probability of winning in the two scenarios was the
same, participants who considered the first distribution of
alternative outcomes estimated a higher probability of
winning than those who considered the second distribution.
Windschitl and Wells (1998) termed this effect the
alternative-outcome effect and replicated it under various
experimental conditions (Windschitl & Wells, 1998;
Windschitl & Young, 2001; Windschitl, Young, & Jenson,
2002; Windschitl & Krizan, 2005).

Focal-outcome effect
Not only alternative outcomes but also focal outcomes can be
divided into multiple possible sub-outcomes with variations
in their distribution. For example, consider a case in which
we estimate the probabilities for carrying an umbrella. The
focal outcome is “you had better take an umbrella,” and the
alternative outcome is “you had better not take an umbrella.”
Both the focal and alternative outcomes can be divided into
several probability components that are useful for making the
final decision. In this case, “rain” and “snow” are the focal
outcomes and “sunny” and “cloudy” are the alternative
outcomes. Variations can exist in the distribution of both the
focal and alternative outcomes. For example, even when the
sum of the percentages of the focal outcomes is 50%, various
combinations of the probabilities of “rain” and “snow” are
possible, such as 40% and 10% or 25% and 25%. Therefore,
the following question arises: which subjective probability of
the focal outcome is higher—40% of rain and 10% of snow
or 25% of rain and 25% of snow? In other words, does the
distribution of the focal outcome affect its subjective
probability?
Although this question is not addressed in previous studies,
those of decision making suggest a possibility that the
609

outcomes affects the probability judgment of the focal
outcome.
The distance from uniform distribution. In the second
possibility, people consider the shape of the distribution for
probability judgment. Although previous studies assume the
effect of the alternative outcome, it is not necessary to
assume that the strength of each alternative outcome affects
probability judgment. This is because many different indexes
can be used to represent the shape of the distribution of
alternative outcomes. For example, not only the strength of
the alternative outcome but also the distance from the
uniform distribution, such as the chi-square value, KullbackLeibler divergence, or local representativeness (Rapoport &
Budescu, 1997) can be used to represent the distribution of
alternative outcomes. In particular, we consider the local
representativeness of multiple outcomes (Rapoport &
Budescu, 1997) as an index for representing the shape of the
distribution of multiple outcomes. Local representativeness
describes the randomness of multiple outcomes that is
quantified by the following formula:

distributive nature of the focal outcome would affect
probability judgment. Support theory (Tversky & Koehler,
1994) assumes that when an outcome A is unpacked into a
disjunction of exclusive constituents, A1 ∨ A2 , the judged
probability generally increases because unpacking increases
the total support for the outcome. In other words, when
A1 ∨ A2 is identified as a partition of A,

s ( A) ≤ s ( A1 + A2 )

(1)
This formulation indicates that the description of focal
outcomes affects the judged probability. For example, Fox
and Tversky (1997) demonstrate that judged probabilities
increase when the outcome “Eastern conference team wins
the NBA championship” is unpacked into a list that mentions
the four strongest teams in the conference. If the shape of the
distribution of focal outcomes is an important source for
describing the focal outcome, its judged probabilities would
change depending on the distribution.
The above example of Support theory also suggests a
possibility that the shape of the distribution of focal outcomes
plays an important role in their probability judgment. In the
present study, we investigate whether the shape of the
distribution of focal outcomes affects probability judgment.

In addition to the determination of the focal-outcome effect,
the present study also investigates another problem: how
does the distribution of focal outcomes affect probability
judgment in which it plays an important role? Although
several indexes exist for representing the shape of the
distribution of multiple outcomes, previous studies of the
alternative-outcome effect do not consider the problem of
representing the effect of the distribution. In this study, we
consider the following two possibilities.
The strength of the strongest alternative outcome. In the
first possibility, people assess the strength of only the
strongest alternative outcome. Windschitl and Wells (1998)
present an interesting account of the alternative-outcome
effect. They propose that people use “the comparison-to-thestrongest heuristic.” According to their explanation, people
tend to compare the strength of a focal outcome with that of
the strongest alternative outcome in order to judge the
probability of the focal outcome. When this comparison is in
strong favor of the focal outcome, its judged probability is
higher. For example, in the study of Windschitl and Wells
(1998), the probabilities of winning estimated by the
participants in the first scenario are higher than those
estimated in the second. This is because the evidence for
winning is stronger than the strongest alternative outcome in
the first scenario (21 > 15) in comparison with that in the
second (21 < 52). Windschitl and Young (2001) refer to this
comparison as a heuristic because it is relatively efficient and
serves as an approximately accurate guide for determining
whether one should be optimistic or pessimistic about the
possibility of the focal outcome. This heuristic presents a
specific example of cognitive processes of probability
judgment and can explain why the distribution of alternative

p

p denotes the observed

probability, and i is equal to 1/n. Local representativeness
is defined as the sum of the differences between 1/n and the
observed probabilities of outcomes. This index can also be
used to represent the effect of the shape of the distribution,
and it provides specific cognitive processes of probability
judgment. In other words, it indicates that people consider all
multiple outcomes for probability judgment.

Experiments
As mentioned above, this study investigates the following
two questions: (1) does the shape of the distribution of focal
outcomes affect probability judgment and (2) if so, what
property of the distribution of focal outcomes plays an
important role in this effect? For this purpose, we used slot
machines that exhibited six characters (A, B, C, D, E, and F),
and three of them (A, B, and C) represented winning letters;
the outcomes of the machines were used as experimental
stimuli.
Participants estimated the subjective certainty of winning
in the fictitious slot machines. First, they read the following
instructions:
You work for an electronics company that manufactures
slot machines. These machines exhibit a letter of the
alphabet in each trial; some letters are winning letters,
while the others are not. However, some machines may
tend to exhibit a specific character very frequently. Your
task is to state how certain you are that the next character
to be exhibited is a winner. In each trial of the machines,
you will indicate your level of certainty on a scale of 0
(impossible) to 9 (very certain).

610

Then, participants were asked to indicate their subjective
certainty for the probability that the next trial of the machine
would produce a winning letter by encircling a line. Their
responses were scored from 0 (impossible) to 9 (very certain)
according to the position of the circle on the line. For
example, a machine exhibited A five times, D four times, and
E one time, and it did not exhibit B, C, and F. Its
experimental trial was presented as follows:

Results and discussion. Figure 1 shows the scatter plots
of the mean ratings for each item. The x-axis denotes the
probabilities of the strongest focal and alternative outcomes,
and the y-axis denotes the mean ratings for each item.
Multiple regression analyses were performed in which the
probabilities of both the strongest focal and alternative
outcomes were independent variables and the means were
dependent variables. Results of these analyses are shown in
Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the objective probabilities of
both the strongest focal and alternative outcomes
significantly affected the mean ratings of the certainty for
winning in the 30% (–0.268, p < 0.05 and –0.410, p < 0.05
for focal and alternative outcomes, respectively) and 50% (–
0.251, p < 0.05 and –0.393, p < 0.05 for focal and alternative
outcomes, respectively) conditions. However, in the 70%
condition, the regression coefficients of both the strongest
focal (0.108, p > 0.10) and alternative (–0.198, p > 0.10)
outcomes were not significant. Thus, the results of the
multiple regression analyses indicated that in the 30% and
50% conditions, variations in the distribution of both focal
and alternative outcomes affected the probability judgment of
the focal outcome, while in the 70% condition, these effects
were not evident.
Further, we performed multiple regression analyses in
which the local representativeness of focal and alternative
outcomes was an independent variable and the mean ratings
of certainty were dependent variables in each condition.
Results of these analyses are shown in Table 1. As shown in
Table 1, the local representativeness of both focal and
alternative outcomes significantly affected the mean ratings
of the certainty for winning in the 30% (–0.308, p < 0.05 and
–0.440, p < 0.05 for focal and alternative outcomes,
respectively) and 50% (–0.277, p < 0.05 and –0.410, p < 0.05
for focal and alternative outcomes, respectively) conditions.
However, in the 70% condition (0.086, p > 0.10 and –0.087,
p > 0.05 for focal and alternative outcomes, respectively), the
regression coefficients of the local representativeness of both
focal and alternative outcomes were not significant. The
results of these analyses also exhibited the same trends as
those in which the strongest focal outcome was an
independent variable. Thus, these results suggest that the
distance from the uniform distribution can be used as an
index for representing the effect of multiple outcomes.

This machine exhibited A 50 times, B 20 times, C 0 times,
D 30 times, E 0 times, and F 0 times.
How certain are you that this machine will produce a
winning letter?
The percentages of the focal outcome were set at 30%, 50%,
and 70%. Participants in Experiment 1 estimated under all
the three conditions, while those in Experiment 2 estimated
under only one of the three conditions.

Experiment 1
Participants. 66 Japanese undergraduates participated in
Experiment 1. Their mean age was 19.58 years (SD = 1.26
years).
Stimuli. We used 160 types of the outcomes of the fictitious
slot machines as stimuli. They exhibited six characters of the
alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, and F), and three of them (A, B, and
C) represented winning letters. An example of the stimuli
was shown in the “Experiments” session. According to the
number of outcomes, the following combinations of the
distribution of focal outcomes and alternative outcomes were
chosen: for the 30% condition, 6 (30, 10, 10; 25, 5, 0; 20, 10,
0; 20, 5, 5; 15, 15, 0; 10, 10, 10) * 8 (70, 0, 0; 60, 10, 0; 60, 5,
5; 50, 20, 0; 50, 10, 10; 40, 15, 15; 30, 30, 10; 25, 25, 20)
combinations; for the 50% condition, 8 (50, 0, 0; 45, 5, 0; 40,
7, 3; 35, 9, 6; 30, 20, 0; 30, 10, 10; 25, 12, 13; 18, 16, 16) * 8
(50, 0, 0; 45, 5, 0; 40, 7, 3; 35, 9, 6; 30, 20, 0; 30, 10, 10; 25,
12, 13; 18, 16, 16) combinations; and for the 70% condition,
8 (70, 0, 0; 60, 10, 0; 60, 5, 5; 50, 20, 0; 50, 10, 10; 40, 15,
15; 30, 30, 10; 25, 25, 20) * 6 (30, 10, 10; 25, 5, 0; 20, 10, 0;
20, 5, 5; 15, 15, 0; 10, 10, 10) combinations. The participants
estimated a total of 160 (6 * 8 + 8 * 8 + 8 * 6) types of
distributions.

Experiment 2

Procedure. The participants were tested in a group setting.
Each participant worked on a booklet that indicated the
variations of the estimation task. The booklet also contained
an instruction that described the experimental task and the
stimuli mentioned above. On the first page of the booklet,
participants were given the instruction. The 66 participants
estimated winning probabilities for 160 raffles.

Participants. 247 Japanese undergraduates participated in
Experiment 2. 83 participants were assigned to the 30%
condition, 85 to the 50% condition, and 78 to the 70%
condition.

Results and discussion. Results obtained under the three
conditions in Experiment 2 are shown in Figure 2. We
performed multiple regression analyses in which the
objective probabilities of both the strongest focal and
alternative outcomes were independent variables and the
means were dependent variables. Results of these analyses
are shown in Table 1. The objective probabilities of both the
strongest focal and alternative outcomes significantly
affected the mean ratings of the certainty for winning in the
30% (–0.268, p < 0.05 and –0.410, p < 0.05 for focal and
alternative outcomes, respectively) and 50% (–0.251, p <
0.05 and –0.393, p < 0.05 for focal and alternative outcomes,
respectively) conditions. However, in the 70% condition, the
regression coefficients of both the strongest focal (0.108, p >
0.10) and alternative (–0.198, p > 0.10) outcomes were not
significant.
Further, we performed multiple regression analyses in
which the local representativeness of focal and alternative
outcomes was an independent variable and the mean ratings
of the certainty were dependent variables in each condition.
The local representativeness of both focal and alternative
outcomes significantly affected the mean ratings of the
certainty for winning in the 30% (–0.39, p < 0.05 and –0.42,
p < 0.05 for focal and alternative outcomes, respectively) and
50% (0.63, p < 0.05 and –0.420, p < 0.05 for focal and
alternative outcomes, respectively) conditions. However, in
the 70% condition (0.11, p > 0.10 and –0.09, p > 0.05 for
focal and alternative outcomes, respectively), the regression
coefficients of the local representativeness of both focal and
alternative outcomes were not significant.
The result of the 50% condition is important because the
trend of the effect of the distribution of focal outcomes is
opposite to that of Experiment 1. This indicates that the
estimated probability for the sum of focal outcomes
decreases with an increase in the uniformity of their
distribution.

General discussion
Determination of focal-outcome effect
This study investigated whether the shape of the distribution
of focal outcomes would affect probability judgment under
various conditions. The results of the two experiments
revealed that the distribution of focal and alternative
outcomes affected probability judgment under conditions in
which the probabilities of focal outcomes were below 50%.
However, this effect was not observed in the 70% condition.
These results showed that not only the distribution of
alternative outcomes but also the focal outcomes would
affect subjective probability judgment. This is a new finding
in probability judgment.
One other noteworthy finding in the present results is a
direction of the effect of the distribution of the focal
outcomes. Studies of the alternative-outcome effect
(Windschitl & Wells, 1998; Windschitl & Young, 2001;
Windschitl, Young, & Jenson, 2002) reveal that the compa-

50% condition in Experiment 2. This indicated that the
subjective probability of focal outcomes increased with the
uniformity of their distribution. The estimated probability of
focal outcomes also increased with the uniformity of their
distribution. These trends were not in agreement with the
prediction of the studies of the alternative-outcome effect
(Windschitl & Wells, 1998; Windschitl & Young, 2001;
Windschitl, Young, & Jensen, 2002). These results were
important because they suggested that cognitive processes
mediating the focal-outcome effect differed from those
mediating the alternative-outcome effect. These patterns of
focal- and alternative-outcome effects might reflect an
adaptive decision strategy for humans (e.g., Payne, Bettman,
& Johnson, 1988). However, this assumption requires further
research.
Another result is that both focal- and alternative-outcome
effects disappear in the 70% condition. This implies a
boundary condition of the focal and the alternative outcomes
effect. That is, these effects occur only when the probabilities
of focal outcomes are small. This possibility also remains an
empirical question.

Index for representing the shape of the distribution
Thus far, several methods have been developed for
explaining how focal and alternative outcomes are assessed
for probability judgment. According to Windschitl and
Young (2001), the examples of possible processes include (a)
analysis of individual components followed by aggregation
to assess the overall strength, (b) sampling of a part of the
evidence obtained from each component to estimate the
strength, and (c) global assessment of the strength without its
assessment for individual outcomes. The study of Windschitl
and coworkers supports the first method, and Dougherty and
Hunter (2003a, b) support the second.
The present study suggests that the distance from the
uniform distribution such as local representativeness can also
be used for the judgment of focal outcomes. By definition,
local representativeness includes the individual probabilities
of all alternative outcomes. It is defined as the sum of the
absolute deviations between the relative frequencies of
multiple outcomes and the corresponding probability
governing the random process (Rapoport & Budescu, 1997).
This implies that people must consider all alternative
outcomes to estimate the distance from the uniform
distribution. Thus, the present result suggests a possibility
that participants consider all the focal and alternative
outcomes for probability judgment.
It should be noted that the present study does not
disprove the explanation of Windschitl and Wells (1998). In
this study, the probabilities of the strongest focal and
alternative outcomes effectively predict the data; hence, the
explanation of Windschitl and Wells (1998) is still valid.
This study only describes an example that demonstrates the
plausibility of assuming the effect of all focal and alternative
outcomes. Further experimental research including a more
comprehensive explanation of the participants’ judgment
process is required.

-rison between the strengths of the focal outcome and the
strongest alternative outcome is in strong favor of the focal
outcome, the subjective probability of focal outcomes is
higher. In other words, the subjective probability for the sum
of alternative outcomes decreases with an increase in the
uniformity of their distribution. Thus, the results of previous
studies of the alternative-outcome effect lead to the
prediction that a more uniform distribution of focal outcomes
should result in a lower subjective probability for the sum of
focal outcomes.
However, the results of the present study were in
contrast to this prediction. The directions of the effect from
the focal outcome are negative, with the exception of the

Methodological limitation
A methodological problem of this study is that it ignores an
individual difference in the strategy for probability judgment.
The studies of the alternative-outcome effect (Windschitl &
Wells, 1998; Windschitl & Young, 2001; Windschitl, Young,
& Jensen, 2002), including the present study, analyze group
data that is summarized among individual participants.
However, it is possible that each participant adopts a different
strategy for probability judgment. In fact, Dougherty and
Hunter (2003) suggest a possibility that cognitive processes
of probability judgment may differ depending on the working
memory capacity. Therefore, in order to examine the
comparison hypothesis in detail, an investigation of the
individual difference factor that would affect probability
judgment is required.
