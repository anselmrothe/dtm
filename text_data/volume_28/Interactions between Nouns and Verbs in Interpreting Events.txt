participants analysis contained factors for noun (mass vs.
count), verb (observation vs. destruction), and verb subtype
(activity destruction verbs plus the observations verbs with
which they were paired, accomplishment destruction verbs
plus the observations verbs with which they were paired,
etc.). This ANOVA revealed a significant verb by noun
interaction and a marginally significant verb by noun by
subtype interaction (FI(1,33) = 4.27, p < .05 and FI(2,33) =

place. The bulleted events were the same events that served
as the final four labels on the timeline in the previous study.
