Participants Twenty students from the University of
Edinburgh participated in the experiment (8 male, 12
female). All were native British English speakers.
Materials The experimental materials used in the Network
Task consisted of 6 visually presented networks based on
those of Oomen and Postma (2001). Each network
contained 8 black and white line drawings, arranged in
different configurations and connected by one, two or three
straight or curved lines. Each network was associated with a
route through the objects. A route always consisted of nine
steps, where six of the pictures occurred once in the route,
and two of the pictures occurred twice. The route through
the network that participants had to follow in their
descriptions was indicated by a red marker that moved along
