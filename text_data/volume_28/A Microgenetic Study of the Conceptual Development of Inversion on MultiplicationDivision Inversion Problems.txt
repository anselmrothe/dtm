Participants
Forty-one Grade 6 students (mean age = 11 years, 6 months)
were included in this study. Participants were drawn from a
large Canadian city and were predominantly W hite and
middle-class. To participate in the study, students were
given a pretest in which they were presented with
Multiplication/Division inversion (e.g., 9 x 6 ÷ 6) and
standard (e.g., 9 x 8 ÷ 4) problems. If they did not report
using the inversion-based shortcut to solve the inversion
problems during the pretest, they participated in the study.
Participants were randomly divided into two groups:
blocked (n = 21) and mixed (n = 20). The study took place
in the first half of the school year.
Materials
Both groups of participants completed seven sessions after
the pretest. In the first six sessions, participants were asked
to solve either 16 Multiplication/Division inversion
problems only or 8 inversion and 8 standard problems.
Participants in the mixed group solved both inversion and
standard problems in all sessions. The blocked group
                                                                   Figure 1: Inversion use across session for both conditions.
received inversion problems only in Sessions 1, 2, 3, and 5
and both inversion and standard problems in Sessions 4 and
6.
                                                                2033

   Accuracy and solution latencies improved across session,
F(1, 39) = 36.52, MSE = 74.93 and F(1, 39) = 27.68, MSE
= 9.22, respectively. The percentage of accurate responses
grew from 91.3% to 99.4% over the course of the sessions
while solution latencies decreased from 5.5s to 3.0s. If
participants are using the inversion shortcut, there should be
fewer errors and shorter solution times as the inversion
shortcut, compared to a computational approach, is fast and
usually error free (Robinson & Ninowski, 2003; Robinson
et al., in press). The increased accuracy and shorter solution
latency pattern found in this study is consistent with an
increased use of the inversion shortcut but could also simply
reflect an increased proficiency in the task. As with the
percentage of reported inversion shortcut use, no group
differences were found, although once again the trends were
for performance to be better for the blocked group. Thus, the
pattern is consistent with the tendency for inversion shortcut
use to be higher in the blocked group.
   Further analysis of the accuracy and solution latencies was
conducted to provide corroborating evidence that the
participants’ verbal reports were veridical. If participants are
using the inversion shortcut rather than a computational
approach (e.g., 4 x 9 ÷ 9: calculate 4 x 9 then divide the
product, 36, by 9), fewer errors should occur and solution
latencies should be shorter. In the first and sixth sessions, for
all inversion problems that both the mixed and blocked
groups were given (n=8), the accuracy and solution latencies
were calculated for inversion shortcut use and the use of
computation. Analyses compared each session separately as
different problems were used in each session. In both
sessions, no differences in accuracy were found which is not
surprising given the overall high accuracy and that no errors
were made on the inversion shortcut trials. The trends were
in the expected direction, however with the means for
inversion shortcut higher than those for computation (see top
of Figure 2). The expected pattern was found with the
solution latencies, t(8) = -3.84, SE = .69 and t(8) = -7.86, SE
= .37, for sessions 1 and 6, respectively. Inversion shortcut
use was significantly faster than computation in both
sessions (see bottom of Figure 2). These analyses provide            Figure 2. Accuracy and solution latencies for inversion use

   As a small number of students may have accounted for                 Finally, as can be seen in Figure 4, the trend was for the
most of the reported inversion use, the percentage of                blocked group to discover the inversion shortcut earlier than
students who reported using the shortcut at least once in a          the mixed group. Based on Siegler and Stern’s (1998) study,
