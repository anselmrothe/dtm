subjects try to find and the hypothesis-testing employed by
the subjects.                                                                Figure 1: Two factors, design of and attribution to a

type is ''three evens'' (where the proportion is 1/8).
Hypothesis testing: There are two types of hypothesis
testing: a positive test and a negative test. The positive test
(P-test) is conducted in an instance where the subject
expects there to be a target. That is, the P-test is a
