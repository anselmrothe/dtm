had learned a second European language between the ages
of 10 and 15 and practised it regularly for at least 5 years.
All volunteers for this test were native English speakers of
comparable age and level of education.
    Voxel-based morphometry revealed that grey-matter
density in the inferior parietal cortex was greater in
bilinguals than monolinguals (Figure 1a). This effect was
significant in the left hemisphere (p < .05) and a trend was
also evident in the right hemisphere. Although increased
grey-matter density in the inferior parietal cortex was
common to both early and late bilinguals, the effect was
greater in the early bilinguals in the left and right
hemispheres. No other significant effects were detected in
either grey or white matter.
    In addition, they (Mechelli et al., 2004) investigated
whether there was a relation between brain structure and
proficiency in the second language and age at acquisition.
Twenty-two native Italian speakers, who had learned
English as a second language when they were between 2
and 34 years old, were tested. Second-language reading,
writing, speech comprehension, and production were
assessed using a battery of standardized neuropsychological
tests. It was found that overall proficiency, as indexed by
principal component analysis, correlated negatively with age
of acquisition (p < .01; r = -0.855). Remarkably, voxel-
based morphometry revealed that second-language
proficiency correlated with grey-matter density in exactly
the same left inferior parietal region (Z-score = 4.1; p < .05;
Figure 1b). In addition, grey-matter density in this region
correlated negatively with the age of acquisition of the
second language (Z-score = 3.2; p < .05; Figure 1c). There
were no other significant effects in grey or white matter.
    The authors (Mechelli et al., 2004) have therefore                    Figure 1: Structural reorganization in the bilingual brain.

The Corpus Callosum
The corpus callosum is another area, in which structural
differences between monolinguals and second language
learners were found (Coggins, Kennedy, & Armstrong,
2004). What could be the role of the corpus callosum in
second language acquisition? (Van den Noort et al., 2005b)
     In response to second and/or third language acquisition
and use, the human brain undergoes cortical adaptation to
accommodate multiple languages either by recruiting
existing regions used for the native language, or by creating
new cortical networks in distinct adjacent areas of the cortex
to handle certain functional aspects of L2. However,
regardless of how the cortex organizes the circuitry required
to handle multiple languages, all non-reflexive behaviour,
including cognition and communication, is normally the             Figure 2: Regional subdivision of the midsagittal corpus
