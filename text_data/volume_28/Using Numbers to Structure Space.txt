predicted that children who heard the set of terms 123
would perform better than those who heard names of
animals.
   It should be noted that our prediction is not at all obvious.
Because children are ordinarily familiar with names of
animals, one might expect that they will remember them
better than numbers. In addition, young children may not
have fully grasped the structure of the set of terms 123. 1
Thus, one might well predict better performance with the set
of animal names.
