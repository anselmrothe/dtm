of phonological similarity elicited by simple versus complex
span tasks as reported by Copeland and Radvansky (2001).
In simple span tasks such as digit span and word span,
participants are typically presented with lists of digits or
words that vary in the number (list length) of items to be
memorized. The task usually begins with a short list length
of 2 or 3 items and the list length is then gradually
incremented in subsequent trials. Participants are required
to recall the items in the order they were presented. The
simple span procedure is probably the most commonly used
technique to investigate serial recall performance. In
complex span tasks such as reading span (Daneman &
Carpenter, 1980), participants are given sentences to read
and simultaneously memorize the last word of each
sentence. For example, participants may read these three
sentences:

Abstract
Memory span for a list of phonologically similar words is
generally worse than memory span for a list of phonologically
dissimilar words, a finding that is called the phonological
similarity effect. This finding has often been cited as
evidence for the use of phonological coding in short-term
memory and working memory. However, some studies have
demonstrated a reversal of the phonological similarity effect
under certain conditions. One such condition is the use of
more complex memory span tasks such as reading span. It
has been suggested that sentence contexts may provide
additional retrieval cues that may overcome the detrimental
effects of phonological similarity.
The present study
examined this hypothesis by manipulating the sentence
contexts of the reading span materials. No evidence showing
phonological similarity facilitation was found; in fact, the
standard phonological similarity decrement in recall was
observed with high context sentences.

Introduction
One of the most well explored phenomenon in short-term
memory research is the phonological similarity effect first
reported by Conrad and Hull (1964). When a participant is
presented similar and dissimilar sounding items to
memorize in a serial recall task, performance is generally
worse for lists of words such as cat, mat, and hat or letters
such as C, D, B, and V, compared to lists of words or letters
that do not sound similar.
However, some recent studies have found that
phonological similarity does not always lead to a decrement
in memory performance and in some cases, the effect
reverses, i.e., performance for phonologically similar items
is better than dissimilar items. Copeland and Radvansky
(2001) observed that the traditional phonological similarity
decrement was obtained for word span tasks where
participants memorized lists of isolated words, but a
phonological similarity facilitation was observed for reading
span tasks in which participants read sentences and were
required to recall the last word of each sentence. Other
researchers have also reported reversals of the phonological
similarity effect for order reconstruction tasks (Nairne &
Kelley, 1999) and nonword recall (Lian, Karlsen & Eriksen,
2004). The present study will focus on the opposing effects

They are then required to recall boss, link, and need at the
end of the sequence. A variant of this complex span
procedure is the operation span task (Turner & Engle,
1989). In this method, the sentences in the reading span
task are replaced with the verification of mathematical
equations such as “Is 5/10 + 3 = 2?”. After participants
verified the equation, they are then given a word to be
memorized before the next equation is shown and so on. In
both types of complex span, the idea is to make participants
process something while trying to remember words.
Copeland and Radvansky (2001) compared the
performance on phonologically similar and dissimilar words
using word, reading, and operation span tasks. In word and
operation span, the traditional phonological similarity effect
was observed. Only the results for reading span found a
reversal of the phonological similarity effect. The authors
suggest that sentence contexts may provide additional
retrieval cues that may overcome the detrimental effects of
phonological similarity in the reading span tasks. In word
and operation span tasks, the knowledge that all the words
within a list rhyme may presumably provide a cue to limit

1829

recall to words that have the same rhyme but may increase
confusions about the serial position of the words within the
list. This has been shown in previous studies that
manipulated word similarity on semantic (Poirier & SaintAubin, 1995) and phonological dimensions (Crowder, 1978;
Schweickert, Guentert & Hersberger, 1990). If the sentence
context reverses the phonological similarity effect, then it
must somehow overcome the phonological confusions that
arise from similar sounding words.
One possibility is that the different sentences provide
distinctive cues that allow the serial position of the
processed words to be better distinguished or more salient.
The additional distinctive cue provides an advantage that
would not be present when memorizing isolated words
without sentence contexts. In other words, in reading
sentences, people may encode the sentences and use them as
retrieval cues, and coupled the knowledge of the rhyming
organization of the to-be-remembered words, lead to better
recall.
The present study has two specific aims. The first is to
determine if the phonological similarity effect reversal in
the reading span task can be replicated. This is reported in
Experiment 1. The second aim is determine if sentence
context was in fact the reason behind the reversal. This is
done in Experiment 2. Previous studies (e.g., Craik &
Tulving, 1975; Schwanenflugel & Shoben, 1985) have
shown that people recall words better when they are
embedded in high constraint or high context sentences,
compared to words embedded in low constraint or low
context sentences. A more direct test of whether context is
truly implicated in reversing the phonological similarity
effect would be to manipulate the contextual value of the
sentences in the reading span task.
If the sentence context provides an effective retrieval cue,
then a high context sentence such as:
The old person drank too much wine while sitting in the
bar.
would be very effective as a cue for retrieving the last word
bar because the word is highly expected within the context
of the sentence. On the other hand, a low context sentence
such as:
The child wanted to celebrate his birthday so his parents
took him to the bar.
would not be a very effective cue for the last word bar. The
word is unexpected and can be easily replaced by another
word.
Importantly, if Copeland and Radvansky’s (2001)
hypothesis that contextual retrieval cues provided by the
sentence frames reverse the detrimental effects of
phonological similarity, then one would expect the reversal
to be greater when such cues are expected to be maximally
effective in the high context sentences.

Experiment 1
The purpose of Experiment 1 is to replicate the findings of
Copeland and Radvansky (2001) where the phonological
similarity effect reverses in the reading span task.
Participants were tested on word span and reading span
tasks, using phonologically similar and dissimilar word lists.
Additionally, the words recalled were scored in two
different ways – the Absolute and Total span scoring
methods (La Pointe & Engle, 1990). In the first method,
only lists in which all words were recalled in their correct
position are considered, and the Absolute Span score is the
total number of words recalled in such lists. This was the
same scoring procedure used by Copeland and Radvansky
(2001). The absolute span method is a more conservative
estimate of memory performance because it only considers
trials in which all words were recalled perfectly. In the
second method, the Total Span score was simply the total
number of words recalled in the correct serial position in all
lists, regardless of whether all the words in each list were
recalled perfectly. Using two scoring procedures would
determine whether the observed effects can be generalized
across different measures.
To replicate the results of Copeland and Radvansky
(2001), it was expected that in the word span task, recall of
similar words would be worse than recall of dissimilar
words. For the reading span task, recall of similar words
would be better than dissimilar words.

Method
Participants Forty introductory psychology students who
were native speakers of Singapore English participated for
course credit.
Design and materials A 2 (Word: similar, dissimilar) x 2
(Task: word span, reading span) within-subjects design was
employed.
A total of 280 words forming 40 sets of various rhymes,
with each set comprising 7 words that shared the same
rhyme (e.g., bolt, colt, jolt), were selected from the Nelson,
McEvoy and Schreiber (1998) norms. The 40 sets were
divided into 4 lists of 10 sets each, with each list balanced
for the number of diphthongs (e.g., bone, toy) short (e.g.,
lock, cent), and long (e.g., see, weed) vowels in the rhyme
sets and the types of rhymes. The lists were also equated for
average log word frequency based on the Kucera and
Francis (1967) counts, as revealed by a nonsignficant oneway between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA), F <
1. The average log frequency of the lists ranged from 2.24
to 2.37.
For each word, a sentence ranging from 9 to 17 words
were constructed to be similar to those used by Copeland
and Radvansky (2001), which ranged from 12 to 16 words.
The to-be-remembered word was always at the end of the
sentence.
A balanced latin-square procedure was used to rotate the
lists across the 4 conditions in the study. For any one
participant, a list was assigned to a single condition and was
never repeated across conditions.

1830

Procedure Participants were tested individually and all did
the word span task before the reading span task. A short
break was provided between each task. Within each task,
half did the similar words before the dissimilar words, and
vice-versa. Prior to each task, 4 practice trials at list lengths
2 and 3 using words and sentences that were not related to
the experimental materials were provided.
For the word span task, words were presented on a
computer monitor at a rate of 1 word per second.
Participants were told to read aloud each word as they were
displayed. For the reading span task, participants read aloud
each sentence, and the experimenter pressed a key on the
keyboard to display the next sentence. At the end of each
trial, a recall prompt was shown and participants were
required to verbally recall the words in the order they were
presented, saying “blank” in place of words they could not
recall. Responses were tape recorded.
Each condition comprised a total of 10 trials, starting with
a list length of 3 and ending with a list length of 7, with 2
trials per list length. In the similar word condition, words or
sentences were randomly sampled without replacement
from the same rhyme set. In the dissimilar word condition,
each word or sentence (up to the number required by the list
length) was randomly sampled without replacement from a
different rhyme set.

similar and dissimilar words at each span task. For word
span, participants scored higher in the dissimilar condition
(M = 26.80, SD = 5.89) than the similar condition (M =
24.18, SD = 6.07), t(39) = 2.62, p < .05. This shows the
regular phonological similarity effect. For reading span,
participants recalled more similar (M = 19.28, SD = 7.45)
than dissimilar (M = 16.88, SD = 6.22) words, t(39) = 2.38,
p < .05, showing a reversal of the phonological similarity
effect. Hence, for the total span scores, Copeland and
Radvansky’s (2001) results were replicated.

Table 2 summarizes the average number of errors across
the words and tasks. We classified errors into 3 types: order
errors (transpositions), omissions (“blank” responses), and
item errors (extra-list intrusions). Paired samples t-tests
were used to compare the differences in error types across
the similar and dissimilar conditions. In general, across both
word and reading span tasks, dissimilar lists elicited more
omission and item errors than similar lists, but similar lists
elicited more order errors.

Results and discussion
The memory span scores for the word and reading span
tasks are summarized in Table 1. A 2-way within subjects
ANOVA performed on the absolute span scores revealed a
significant Word x Task interaction, F(1, 39) = 6.26, MSe =
10.19, p < .05. The simple effects of task at both word
conditions showed that word span scores were higher than
reading span scores for both similar, t(39) = 8.13, p < .001,
and dissimilar, t(39) = 10.12, p < .001, words. This is not
surprising as reading span is the more difficult task. The
more important simple effects are those between similar and
dissimilar words at each span task. For word span,
participants scored higher in the dissimilar condition (M =
15.38, SD = 5.69) than the similar condition (M = 10.95, SD
= 6.37), t(39) = 4.95, p < .001. This shows the traditional
phonological similarity effect.
For reading span,
participants also recalled more dissimilar (M = 4.83, SD =
3.93) than similar (M = 2.93, SD = 3.36) words, t(39) =
2.55, p < .05, again showing a phonological similarity
decrement. Hence, for absolute span scores, Copeland and
Radvansky’s (2001) results were not replicated. Although
both span tasks show a reliable phonological similarity
decrement, the significant interaction can be attributed to a
smaller decrement between similar and dissimilar words in
the reading span task compared to the word span task.
For the total span scores, a significant Word x Task
interaction was also obtained, F(1, 39) = 15.19, MSe =
16.62, p < .001. Again, the simple effects of task at both
word conditions showed that word span scores were higher
than reading span scores for both similar, t(39) = 3.54, p <
.01, and dissimilar, t(39) = 8.32, p < .001, words. As
before, the important simple effects are those between

These error patterns are consistent with previous studies
manipulating word similarity on memory span (e.g., Fallon,
Groves, & Tehan, 1999; Lian et al., 2004; Poirier & SaintAubin, 1995). The similarity features could perhaps be used
as global retrieval cues to help recall of the specific words in
each list, but the shared features between specific words
may result in positional confusion and therefore lead to
more transpositions. Conversely, dissimilarity does not
confer such retrieval cue advantages, and so when errors
occur, they tend to be omissions or extra-list intrusions.

0.02, p < .001. To determine the source of the interaction,
the simple simple effects of word at each list length in the
two span tasks were examined. For the word span task, the
similar-dissimilar difference at list lengths 3, 6, and 7 were
not significant, all ts(39) < 1.06. At list length 4, more
dissimilar words (M = .95, SD = .10) were recalled than
similar words (M = .78, SD = .23), t(39) = 4.34, p < .001.
The same pattern was found at list length 5, t(39) = 3.48, p <
.001, more dissimilar words (M = .65, SD = .25) were
recalled than the similar words (M = .49, SD = .21). For the
reading span task, the similar-dissimilar difference was
found to be significant at list length 5 only, t(39) = 2.92, p <
.01, showing a phonological similarity facilitation with
more similar words (M = .42, SD = .24) correctly recalled
than dissimilar words (M = .31, SD = .23). The differences
at all other list lengths were not significant, all ts(39) < 1.81.
The list length analyses show patterns supporting
Copeland and Radvansky (2001), but it occurs only at list
length 5 where it may be at the limit of short-term memory
capacity for most participants. There may be ceiling and
floor effects at the shorter and longer list lengths preventing
phonological similarity effects from emerging. The next
experiment will attempt to directly test the notion that
sentence context is the reason behind the phonological
similarity facilitation found in the reading span task.

Different patterns of results were found in the absolute
and total span scores for reading span, where the absolute
span scores showed the traditional phonological similarity
decrement while the total span scores supported Copeland
and Radvansky’s phonological similarity facilitation. As the
absolute span scoring procedure has a stricter criterion in
which all items at any particular list length must be recalled
in perfect order before they are counted, an examination of
performance at each list length may shed some light on
precisely which list length may be responsible for the
disparate results. It is possible that performance indices may
be obscured at the shorter (e.g., list length 3) and the largest
(e.g., list length 7) list lengths due to differences in
cognitive load. The best indicator of the direction of
phonological similarity effects may be found at list lengths
which approach the average short-term memory capacity for
words of participants. Figure 1 shows the proportion of
correctly recalled words across the various list lengths.

If sentence context provides information that will overcome
the usual phonological confusions arising from memorizing
similar sounding words, it may be possible to enhance or
reduce this effect by manipulating the contextual value of
the sentences. The present experiment examined reading
span performance for similar and dissimilar words using
high and low context sentences. If the hypothesis that
sentence context does provide information that will
overcome the detrimental effects of phonological similarity,
one would expect the phonological similarity reversal to be
greatest with high context sentences and attenuated or
eliminated with low context sentences. In light of the
findings from Experiment 1 that most of the differences
between similar and dissimilar words occurred at about list
length 5, a fixed length procedure using list length 5 was
employed in the present experiment to avoid potential
obscuring of the results by ceiling and floor effects.

For each word, one high and one low context sentence
were constructed with the same structure as the sentences in
Experiment 1, in which the to-be-remembered word was
always at the end of the sentence. To ensure that the high
and low context sentences were appropriate, 40 participants
who did not take part in either experiment rated the

Table 4 summarizes the error patterns. In general, paired
samples t-tests revealed essentially the same results found in
Experiment 1. Except for the lack of any reliable difference
in omissions between similar and dissimilar words in high
context sentences, there were more order errors for similar
words and more item errors and omissions for dissimilar
words.

Procedure The procedure was similar to the reading span
task in Experiment 1, except that each condition comprised
a total of 5 trials of 5 sentences each, following the fixed list
length procedure. The order in which the 4 conditions were
presented was counterbalanced across participants. As the
memory span procedure using variable list lengths was not
used in this experiment, absolute and total span scores were
not relevant. Scoring was based on the proportion of
correct-in-position serial recall.

Note.

In Experiment 1, the pattern of results in the word span task
was consistent with the traditional phonological similarity
effect; dissimilar words were better recalled than similar
words. There was some evidence that this effect reversed in
the reading span task when total span scores and list length
analyses were considered, replicating the trend reported by
Copeland and Radvansky (2001). However, with absolute
span scores, the effect showed a phonological similarity
decrement rather than facilitation. These inconsistent
findings with reading span suggest that it may be important
to use multiple scoring procedures to probe differential
performance in future studies so as to ascertain the
generalizability of the effects across measures.
As most of the action in Experiment 1 appeared to be
taking place at about list length 5, Experiment 2 was
conceived to directly test Copeland and Radvansky’s (2001)
argument that the reversal of the phonological similarity
effect is dependent on whether contextual information can
overcome or attenuate phonological confusions. It was
hypothesized that recall for similar words would be better
than dissimilar words for sentences with high contextual
value. This reversal did not occur; instead the traditional
phonological similarity effect appears to be present in the
high context sentences and eliminated in the low context
sentences.
Although the reading span results across the two
experiments were not entirely consistent, there are two
reasons why we think a conclusion that sentence context
does not cause a reversal of the phonological similarity
effect is viable. First, the overall pattern in Experiment 2
showed that context availability led to general recall
facilitation, which was evident from the recall scores in the
high and low context sentences in both similar and

Serial recall performance is summarized in Table 3. A twoway within-subjects ANOVA revealed a significant Word x
Context interaction, F(1, 39) = 17.10, MSe = 0.01, p < .001.
Tests of simple effects showed that with high context
sentences, recall of dissimilar words (M = .57, SD = .12)
was higher than similar words (M = .49, SD = .14), t(39) =
4.54, p < .001. On the other hand, for low context
sentences, no differences in recall was found between
similar (M = .45, SD = .17) and dissimilar words (M = .42,
SD = .14), t(39) = 1.09, ns. Thus, the hypothesis that the
reversal of the phonological similarity effect is due to
sentence context is not supported. In fact, it appears that a
traditional phonological similarity decrement was observed
with the high context sentences, but eliminated with low
context sentences.

In the similar condition, recall of words in high context

dissimilar conditions. Recall was better when participants
were presented high context sentences than when they were
provided with low context sentences. These results are
consistent with previous studies on context effects on
memory (e.g., Craik & Tulving, 1975; Schwanenflugel &
Shoben, 1983; Schwanenflugel & Shoben, 1985;
Wattenmaker & Shoben, 1987). Craik and Tulving (1975)
emphasizes the fact that one of the possible ways in which
memory codes could be elaborated would be to provide a
richer and better context. However, this manipulation of
context clearly did not diminish the phonological similarity
decrement in the expected direction. It may have enhanced
the availability of item information in high context
sentences so that participants could remember the last words
better (which is consistent with better overall recall in high
context sentences), but if the words all sounded alike, then
confusions as to the serial position of these words ensued,
leading to the traditional phonological similarity effect. In
low context sentences, item information suffers because the
sentence frame does not predict the last word, and so there
is a general decrement in recall regardless of whether the
words sound similar or not, leading to an elimination of
phonological similarity effects.
Second, this interpretation is supported by the error
patterns, which were remarkably consistent across the two
experiments. More order errors were observed in the
similar conditions, and more omissions and item errors were
observed in the dissimilar conditions.
These results
replicate and extend previous findings that show
dissociations between item and order information when
similarity is manipulated (e.g. Fallon et al., 1999; Lian et
al., 2004; Poirier & Saint-Aubin, 1995).
In summary, the main goal of the present study was to
examine Copeland and Radvansky’s (2001) hypothesis that
sentence context in the reading span test was responsible for
the phonological similarity reversal in their experiments. In
this regard, there was no strong evidence that the
phonological similarity effect would be reversed when the
contextual value of the sentences is manipulated.
