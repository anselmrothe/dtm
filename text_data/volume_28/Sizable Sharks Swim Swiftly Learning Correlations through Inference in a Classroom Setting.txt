                               Abstract
   Fifth-graders’ results from a category learning experiment
   suggest that inferring stimulus properties given the category
   membership leads to better acquisition of category knowl-
   edge than classifying stimulus items. Fifth-graders liked better
   and learned more properties of the shark categories acquired
   through inference than those acquired through classification.
   Classification promoted learning of only the property that was
   most diagnostic in discriminating among categories. Inference
   facilitated learning of all properties associated with each cate-
   gory, including properties not queried during training. Seven
   to 33 days after training, fifth-graders who inferred still had
   more information about properties of each category than fifth-
   graders who classified. Classroom teaching should emphasize
   reasoning from the category to multiple properties rather than
   from a set of properties to the category.
Category learning researchers seek to understand better how
humans encode, organize, and use knowledge. Given these
objectives, research in category learning should have impor-
tant implications for education. However, the link between                Figure 1: A classification learning trial is shown. The de-
