subjects were gender-matched controls with no
acquaintances among the individuals in the database. All
subjects were compensated for their participation in this
study.
Stimuli
We used a database of faces depicting residents and
affiliates of an undergraduate dorm at MIT. The full image
set contains 190 unique individuals, half men and half
women. Each individual is pictured in left and right profile,
left and right ¾ view, and in two different frontal images.
The pictures were initially full-color and 640x480 pixels in
size.
  For presentation, the images were resized to 128x96
pixels, and reduced to grayscale so that broad color cues
could not facilitate recognition of targets. To make the
matching tasks less trivial, target faces were also Gaussian-
blurred in Adobe Photoshop to approximately 6 cycles
across the face. Blurring was intended to discourage
subjects from performing matching based on small-scale
details like moles or blemishes on the face.
  Cue images were generated for the “Gender” and
“Orientation” tasks by creating facial morphs of the images
in our database using MorphMan. The orientation cue image
was the result of morphing together all faces in the database.
For the “Gender” task, male and female cue images were
created by morphing together all the men and women in the         Figure 1: An illustration of the cued 2AFC task used in all

present are very easy, we do not expect to see any variation
in accuracy across subjects or tasks. If the relevant cognitive
processes are truly independent of familiarity, we expect
that responses to “Familiar” faces should be no faster than
those to “Unfamiliar” faces. To control for the fact that
some faces may be easier than others to classify according
to gender (or orientation and identity), we shall also directly
compare the speed advantage for “Familiar” v. “Unfamiliar”
faces in our experimental group to that derived from the
control group. In doing so, we are able to rule out any
effects of potentially confusing images that are only
accurately classified if one has personal knowledge of the         Figure 2: The average RT advantage for familiarity in the

RT is larger than zero to a highly significant level (p <
0.005). The same statistic calculated for the Control group
yields a non-significant difference (p > 0.4).
  While it is premature to conclude from this that personal
familiarity is definitely able to affect such a low-level visual
judgment as face orientation, we find the consistency within
the experimental group with regard to this speed difference
to be compelling. Moreover, the comparison to the control
group may be less crucial in this condition than for gender
or identity matching. A particular face may be difficult to
assign gender to, or to recognize from a new view, making
it crucial to compare experimental group performance to
that of controls. However it seems difficult to imagine how
a face could appear “more upside down” than another (as
opposed to more feminine or more masculine), weakening
