Compensating for Lacking Self-explanations
Students often overestimate their understanding of examples
and thus refrain from further elaborating them. Moreover,
even if they have noticed gaps in their knowledge, they may
not be able to generate self-explanations to overcome those
gaps. These problems may be solved by providing addi-
