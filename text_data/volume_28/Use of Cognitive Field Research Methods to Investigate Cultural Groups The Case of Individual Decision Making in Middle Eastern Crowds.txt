conducted in parallel with data collection, and theories are
developed and revised throughout the study. During analysis,
the researcher identifies themes and patterns in the behaviors,
customs, rules, and beliefs that are representative of the entire
group. Based on these observations, the ethnographer makes
inferences about the culture of the group. The product of
ethnographic research is usually a written narrative of the
cultural group.
   Although ethnography has much to offer, and it forms a
broader basis for much naturalistic research, several features
of ethnography in its “classic form” make it relatively
unattractive for investigating issues like decision making in
crowds. First, the method requires that extensive time be
spent with a particular localized group of people. This is
certainly useful and appropriate for many kinds of studies.
However, it is undesirable when the research aims require the
capturing of sporadic and dispersed events like crowd
incidents. Secondly, standard ethnographies tend to focus on                             Figure 1: CDM overview.
