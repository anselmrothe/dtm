   (ii) that the genesis of synchronous firing in non-sensory
domains may, for all we know, involve a substratum of CBNs.
   In addition, I have, in section 2, presented a connectionist
model, grounded upon conjunctive coding, which illustrates
how synchronous bindings could be engendered in the realm
of roles and fillers. The model clearly requires just a compar-
atively small number of conjunctive nodes, and (contrary to
my diagrams’ proportions) is compatible with a widely dis-
tributed configuration of nodes, separated by irregular dis-
tances. As previously acknowledged, the model is not pro-
posed as biologically realistic. Rather, it is presented as a
hypothetical analogue whose details may suggest the direc-
tion in which the true explanation of synchronous binding is
to be found. In any case, the hypothetical model illustrates an
important possibility, i.e., that binding via synchronous fir-
ing is merely a symptom of a deeper form of binding, one
that intrinsically involves the operation of conjunctive bind-
ing nodes.
