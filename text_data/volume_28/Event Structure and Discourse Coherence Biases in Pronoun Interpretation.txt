Abstract

Goal continuations (continuations which correspond to a
Goal interpretation for the pronoun) rivaled Source
continuations in frequency. This result is unexpected in
light of a variety of existing models of pronoun
interpretation. The subject preference (Crawley, Stevenson,
& Kleinman 1990) predicts that an ambiguous pronoun
ought to be coreferential with the subject of the previous
sentence, in this case the Source. The first-mention privilege
(Gernsbacher & Hargreaves 1988) also points to the
salience of the Source subject. The grammatical parallelism
preference (Smyth 1994; Chambers & Smyth 1998) predicts
that an ambiguous subject pronoun resolves preferentially to
a subject antecedent, again the Source for examples like (1).
Stevenson et al.’s results are compatible with two
explanations for the promotion of the non-subject Goal.
The first is a thematic-role-level preference which amounts
to a heuristic ranking Goals above Sources. The second
explanation is an event-level bias for focusing on the end
state of the previously described event. Stevenson et al.
consider the Goal to be more salient than the Source with
respect to the end state in transfer-of-possession events.
In this paper, we seek to separate out the thematic-role
preference from the event structure bias in Stevenson et al.’s
results. We further investigate whether the Goal preference
can receive deeper motivation from mechanisms that are
used in establishing coherence in discourse.

In a story completion study involving transfer-of-possession
passages (John handed a book to Bob. He _____), Stevenson
et al. (1994) identified a pronoun interpretation preference
that is compatible with two possible explanations: a
superficial thematic role bias for Goals over Sources, and a
deeper event structure bias toward focusing on the end state of
such events. To distinguish these hypotheses, we conducted
an experiment manipulating the salience of the end state by
comparing the perfective (handed) and imperfective (was
handing) forms of the transfer verb. We found that sentences
in the imperfective yielded significantly more Source
resolutions than those in the perfective, supporting the eventstructure hypothesis. Furthermore, we found that a significant
proportion of Goal interpretations arise from continuations
which use Occasion (i.e. narration-based) coherence relations.
As such, the interpretation preferences are better explained at
the level of event structure and discourse coherence, rather
than by appeal to superficial heuristics.
Keywords: discourse processing, pronoun interpretation

Interpreting Ambiguous Pronouns
The question of whether pronouns are interpreted based
primarily on surface-level linguistic cues (subjecthood, first
mention, recency, parallelism) or as a byproduct of deeper
discourse-level processes and representations (inference,
event structure) remains unresolved in the literature. These
two views come together in a story-completion study by
Stevenson, Crawley, and Kleinman (1994; see also Arnold
2001) where they test the influence of thematic roles on
pronoun interpretation. One of their most striking results
comes from an experiment with story completions like (1)
with a transfer-of-possession context sentence followed by
an ambiguous pronoun.

The thematic roles remain the same in examples (2) and (3),
but the perfective verb in (2) describes a completed event
which is compatible with end-state focus, whereas the
imperfective verb in (3) describes an event that is an
ongoing process, making it incompatible with end-state
focus (Moens & Steedman 1988). Thus the thematic role
preference predicts a Goal bias for both (2) and (3), while

The context sentence in these passages contains two
possible referents for the pronoun, one that appears in
subject position and fills the Source thematic role, and one
that appears as the object of a sentence-final prepositional
phrase and fills the Goal thematic role. They found that
697

the event structure hypothesis predicts fewer Goal
interpretations for (3) since the imperfective verb is
inconsistent with a salient end state. The differences in
verbal aspect therefore allow us to distinguish between the
two explanations of Stevenson et al.’s data by separating out
the intrinsic thematic role assignments of the verb from the
end-state focus at the event level.

Task
Participants were asked to write continuations for
the fifty passages. They were instructed to imagine a
natural continuation to the story, writing the first
continuation that came to mind and avoiding humor. In this
task, participants create a mental model of the event in the
context sentence and then write a continuation that reflects
their expectations about where the story is going. As such,
the task involves both interpretation and production. The
pronoun prompt constrains the surface realization of their
continuation, but their continuation depends on their
expectations about how the discourse will proceed and
which individual in the event will be mentioned again.

Experiment and Methodology
Following Stevenson et al., we used a story completion task
to elicit continuations which were then evaluated to
determine the participants’ intended pronoun interpretations.
Participants
Forty-eight monolingual English-speaking
undergraduates at UC San Diego participated in the study
for extra credit in Linguistics courses.

Evaluation and Analysis Two trained judges assessed the
participants’ intended pronoun interpretations. Judges were
instructed to be cautious, erring on the side of categorizing a
pronoun as ambiguous if the pronoun could be interpreted
plausibly as coreferential with either referent.1 As such, not
all responses could be disambiguated; our treatment of the
ambiguous cases will be discussed in the next section.
Analyses of variance were conducted on the assessed
pronoun interpretations. We tested for main effects of verbal
aspect and verb type on pronoun interpretation, as well as an
interaction between the two factors.

Stimuli
The twenty-one experimental stimuli consisted
of a transfer-of-possession context sentence followed by an
ambiguous pronoun prompt, as in (2) and (3). To
manipulate event structure, we varied the aspect of the verb.
Participants saw either the perfective or imperfective form
of each verb, but not both. The Source referent always
appeared in subject position, and the Goal was the object of
a to-phrase. All verbs described physical transfer events (ex.
hand, throw). We excluded verbs that described abstract or
conceptual transfer (ex. show, teach), though prior work on
transfer of possession has included them (e.g. Arnold 2001).
The twenty-one verbs in the stimuli were classified along
two dimensions: co-location of event participants and
guarantee of successful transfer. We were interested in how
these properties might affect the salience of the available
referents. Verbs in Class 1 describe events in which the
Source and Goal are co-located and the default assumption
is successful transfer. Verbs in Class 2 lack this sense of
guaranteed transfer but have co-located participants. Verbs
in Class 3 lack a co-located Source and Goal and have a
diminished sense of guaranteed transfer.

Results and Interpretation
The results show a main effect of verbal aspect
(F(1,48)=50.622, p<0.0001), as summarized in Figure 1.

Our results indicate that pronoun interpretation strategies are
sensitive to verbal aspect: The proportion of Source and
Goal interpretations are roughly equal in the perfective
condition, whereas the imperfective condition shows an
increase in the proportion of Source interpretations (from
51% to 70%). Since imperfective aspect is used to describe
an event as ongoing and incomplete, it is incompatible with

Fillers We also included twenty-nine sentences with nontransfer verbs in the context sentence. These fillers consisted
of transitive and intransitive verbs in the perfective or
imperfective. The transitive verbs (Agent-Patient and
Experiencer-Stimulus) varied in active and passive voice.
Adverbs, proper names, or gender-unambiguous pronouns
served as prompts.

Our use of judges follows Arnold (2001). Stevenson et al. (1994)

Because Figure 1 excludes cases that were judged to be

Treatment of Ambiguity
In evaluating each continuation, the judges either assigned a
Source or Goal interpretation for the pronoun, or marked the
continuation as ambiguous. Across 1008 continuations,
there were no conflicts in which one judge assigned a
Source interpretation while the other assigned a Goal
interpretation. There was variation, however, in the
determination of ambiguity. To be cautious, we set aside all
responses in which at least one judge assessed the pronoun
as potentially ambiguous; Figure 1 represents this
conservative evaluation. If, on the other hand, we include
all cases in which at least one judge assigned an
interpretation, the effect of verbal aspect becomes stronger:
Imperfectives yield even more Source resolutions (75%)
than perfectives (53%; F(1,48)=51.679, p<0.0001).
To illustrate, the pronoun in the underlined continuation in
(4) may be biased toward a Goal interpretation, but either
interpretation is possible. As such, both judges agreed that
the participant’s continuation in (4) was ambiguous.

On the other hand, the Source preference for Classes 1 and 2

Because imperfective aspect resulted in an increased

to reflect deeper event-level biases rather than surface-level

There was also a significant interaction of aspect and verb
class (F(2, 100)=4.44, p<0.01), stemming primarily from the
variation across classes in the perfective aspect.
In keeping with the event structure hypothesis, it appears
that the lack of a co-located Goal for Class 3 verbs
diminishes the salience of the individual associated with the
end state, namely the Goal. All three classes consistently
show a Source preference in the imperfective.
In fact, the closest we came to witnessing a Goal
preference is in continuations following perfective Class 2
verbs.2 The differences across verb classes suggest that
much depends on the verbs chosen for the task. Just as
pronoun interpretation appears to be sensitive to verb
properties like the co-location of Source and Goal, one
would expect that other properties of transfer verbs could
influence the accessibility of each referent. For example,
the verbs tell and hand both signal transfer, but they differ
in the degree of affectedness of the Goal. A recipient that
undergoes a change of state or is otherwise affected may
draw more attention to the end state of that event.
To summarize, we see that differences emerge across
fairly coarse-grained verbal categories. Furthermore, it was
clear in doing the analysis that the properties of individual
verbs matter as well, even for verbs from the same class. As
such, verbs influence pronoun interpretation by way of their
lexical semantics. Next, we turn to discourse semantics,
showing how the coherence relationships between clauses
reflect the pronoun interpretation strategies at work.

a variety of heuristic pronoun interpretation strategies that
have been proposed in the psycholinguistic literature are
largely side effects of the process of establishing these and
other COHERENCE RELATIONS. We list below three relations
with examples from the participants’ story completions.
EXPLANATION: Infer P from the assertion of sentence S1
and Q from the assertion of sentence S2, where normally
QP.
(8) Matt passed a sandwich to David. He didn’t want
David to starve. [Explanation (Source)]
P ARALLEL : Infer a common or contrasting relation
p(a1,a2,…) from S1 for entities ai and infer p(b1,b2,…)
from S2 for entities b i where some property qi holds of a i
and bi for all i.
(9) Matt passed a sandwich to David. He put fruit on
his plate too.
[Parallel (Source)]
OCCASION: Infer a change of state for a system of
entities in S2, establishing the initial state for this system
from the final state of S1. (adapted from Hobbs 1990)
(10) Matt passed a sandwich to David. He ate it up.
[Occasion (Goal)]
The inference processes that underlie the establishment of
these relations are fundamentally different. Establishing an
Explanation relation requires that the hearer draw a chain of
cause-effect inferences that connect the two eventualities
(i.e., events or states) that are being related. Such inference
supports interpreting the pronoun in (8) to refer to (the
subject Source) Matt. Establishing Parallel relations, on the
other hand, is based on identifying points of similarity and
contrast among the eventualities being related. Such
inference supports interpreting the pronoun in (9) to refer to
its (in this case, grammatically) parallel element, which here
is again the subject Matt. Finally, establishing Occasion
relations requires that a state of affairs be inferred as a point
of connection between the eventualities expressed by each
clause, i.e., that the initial state of the second eventuality be
identified with the final state of the first. Since the state of
possessing something is a precondition to eating it, such
inference supports interpreting the pronoun in (10) to refer
to the (non-subject Goal) David.
Note that of these relations, only the Occasion relation
directly encodes a bias toward focusing on the end state of
the previous eventuality. As such, if Kehler (2002) is
correct, we might expect to see evidence for a Goal
preference only in those cases that are related by an
Occasion relation.
We had our judges annotate all unambiguous responses
with the coherence relation that held between the context
sentence and the continuation. Judges resolved
disagreements through discussion, following Stevenson,
Knott, Oberlander, & McDonald (2000). We restricted the
analysis to the perfective cases since only these are
compatible with end-state focus. Five coherence relations

Effects of Coherence
Consider the following completion from the corpus of
participants’ continuations:
(7) Miriam sent a fruitcake to Rachel. She didn't want to
eat it.
Both judges categorized this example as ambiguous.
Upon closer inspection, this ambiguity stems from how the
clauses themselves are related to one another. If the second
clause is interpreted as an explanation of the first – the
'diswanting' was the cause of the sending – then she will
most likely be interpreted to refer to Miriam. If the second
clause is taken to occasion the first – that is, the diswanting
was connected to the sending but happened subsequently to
it – she will most likely be interpreted to refer to Rachel.
Example (7) illustrates two types of inferential processing
hearers use to establish relations between clauses in a
discourse, as described in Kehler (2002). Kehler argued that
2

It is worth pointing out that although Stevenson et al. summarize
their results in the text as a Goal preference, they also found some
variation across different experimental conditions. For the SourceGoal stimuli in the condition that mirrors our stimuli, it appears
from their Table 3 (p. 529) that there was actually a slight Source
preference. (The positive 0.16 score for that condition indicates a
preference for the Source, though they do not address whether it
was statistically significant.) Nonetheless, the fact that the number
of Goal interpretations rivals the number of Source interpretations
is unexpected.

and two others (Result, another cause-effect-based relation,
and Elaboration, which patterns most closely with Parallel).

Goal; they are precisely the relations that rely on the end
state of an event in establishing coherence.4
Since Occasion relations attend to the end state of the
previous event, it follows that context sentences that lack a
salient endpoint will give rise to a different distribution of
coherence relations. The continuations following
imperfective context sentences did indeed have a
significantly different coherence distribution from those
following perfective context sentences (F(1,48)=30.949,
p<0.0001). Imperfective context sentences yielded
continuations that were dominated by a large proportion of
Elaboration relations (49%) and a smaller proportion of
Occasion relations (31%), whereas the perfectives yielded
fewer Elaborations (31%) and more Occasions (43%).
This study is similar to one from Arnold (2001) in which
continuations were classified using a three-way distinction
(endpoint/cause/other). She found a similar correlation
between Goal interpretations and endpoints. We agree with
Arnold’s proposal that expectations about where the
discourse is going influence the likelihood that a referent is
rementioned in participants’ story continuations. The
different distribution of coherence relations following
perfective and imperfective context sentences attests to
these discourse level biases.
Much more remains to be said about the relationship
between coherence establishment and pronoun
interpretation. This study, however, adds further support to
our claim that surface-level heuristics like subjecthood,
grammatical parallelism, and thematic-role preferences are
not enough to explain the patterns one finds for pronoun
interpretation. Instead, a much richer model of discourse
processing is necessary (see also Wolf, Gibson, & Desmet
2004; Kertz, Kehler, & Elman 2006).

Figure 5: Pronoun interpretation across coherence
relations for perfective verbs
We found that Occasion relations were dominated by
continuations that refer to the Goal (χ 2=55.46, p<0.0001),
while Elaborations and Explanations showed no evidence of
the Goal preference; indeed these relations showed a Source
preference following perfective context sentences
(Elaboration: χ2=131.18, p<0.0001; Explanation: χ2=29.28,
p<0.0001).3 The restriction of the Goal preference to
Occasion relations reinforces the conclusion that a generic
thematic role preference is insufficient as a predictor of
pronoun interpretation. Our results further suggest that the
event structure bias itself is epiphenomenal, a consequence
of the type of coherence relation that is inferred to hold
between two clauses in a discourse.
Because our analysis was restricted to perfective verbs,
the cases summarized in Figure 5 have an event structure
with a salient endpoint. Crucially, though, it is the
coherence relation that dictates whether that endpoint is
relevant. Occasion relations show a clear preference for the

Conclusions
The results from our story continuation experiment support
the conclusion that a previously observed thematic-rolelevel bias is a side effect of an event structure bias.
Furthermore, the event structure bias is predictably
associated with only certain types of coherence relations in
the discourse. That is, the thematic-role bias depends on the
availability of a salient Goal at the endpoint of the event,
and similarly, the effects of the event-structure bias are
contingent on the type of coherence relation at work. Given
this, we argue that pronoun interpretation must be addressed
within a broader theory of event structure and discourse
comprehension rather than by appeal to superficial
heuristics.

3

We also found a Goal bias for Result relations, but the small set
of Result continuations (n=24) was very homogenous, more than
half consisting of the form X transfers Y to Z. Z thanks X. The
similarity of the continuations in our data makes extrapolation
difficult. In any case, whereas Kehler's model of coherence would
predict that causal inference plays a greater role in establishing
Result relations than Occasion relations, the effect described by the
second eventuality in a cause-effect sequence is often a direct
result of the end state brought about by the first. It would perhaps
not be surprising if the second eventuality in a cause-effect
sequence exhibited a similar statistical bias toward focusing on the
end state of the first.
There were likewise too few cases of Parallel relations (n=8) to
support any conclusions.

4

Stevenson et al. (2000) also report Occasion (or ‘Narration’ in
their terminology) as the most common type of continuation in
cases where the pronoun referred to the Goal. However, they do
not report the number of Narrations with Source interpretations,
and thus we cannot compare our results directly with theirs.
