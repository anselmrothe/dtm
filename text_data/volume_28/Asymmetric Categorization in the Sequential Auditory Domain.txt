    In light of these results and the asymmetric visual
categorization asymmetry observed in infants, we decided to
attempt to explore this phenomenon in a controlled acoustic
environment using artificially produced musical stimuli
presented to non-musician participants.
                         Experiment 1
The aim of this experiment was to assess an effect of interval
distribution in the formation of melodic categories. To this
end, we compared the exclusivity of auditory sequential
categories formed during exposure to exemplars of melodies,
statistically controlled in terms of their interval distributions.
In this experiment we attempted to reproduce the category
inclusion and distribution relationships that produced the
asymmetric categorization results in Quinn et al., 1993 (see
Figure 1).

revealed a significant main effect of test items (F(1,49)=4.51,
p<.05). In other words, as in the Quinn et al.’s (1993) Dog-
Cat studies, participants familiarized with the narrow (i.e.,
low-variability) stimuli excluded more contrasting items (in
this case, new broad items), whereas participants familiarized
with the broad (i.e., high-variability) category rejected narrow
items at no better than chance.              This mirrors the
inclusion/exclusion relationships observed in Quinn et al.
(1993)’s stimuli.
                        Experiment 2
In light of the results of the first experiment, we decided to
tighten the constraints on the statistical properties of the
sequences of notes comprising the melodies for the broad and
narrow categories. This was done in order to determine if it
was possible to enhance the effects found in the first
experiment. In addition, during training, we decided to use a
more incidental memory task.                                           Figure 4: Probabilities of occurrence of the 7 transitions, in

Procedure
Participants were seated in front of a computer. Melodies
were played through headphones. In a first phase, participants
were asked to listen to the melodies, and to report the total
number of pitches of each sequence. Feedback was given
after each answer, indicating whether or not their reply was
correct, and if not, reporting the right number of pitches. The
inter-trail interval between the subject's answer and the next
melody was 2 seconds. In a second phase, participants heard
pairs of melodies. They were then asked to select, for each
pair, the melody most similar to the ones they had heard in
the first phase. Both groups had 12 participants.
