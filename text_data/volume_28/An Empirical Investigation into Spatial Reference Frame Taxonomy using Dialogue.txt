   Reference frames are abstract representations that enable
   people to describe the location of objects using projective
   descriptions such as, above, below, left, and right. There have
   typically been three broad classes of reference frames
   identified in the literature: Those that are based upon the
   environment, those based upon an object and those that are
   egocentric. However, the exact details of reference frame
   classification have been disputed. In this paper we present two
   experiments that used a confederate priming paradigm that set
   out to distinguish between the Traditional taxonomy and
   Levinson’s taxonomy of reference frames. The results provide
   evidence supporting the Traditional taxonomy of reference
   frames. We suggest possibilities for further investigations of
   reference frame alignment.

     Experiment 2 therefore tested whether or not a different
position of the reference object on the match scene and
target scene affects levels of alignment. This experiment
added a fourth condition (intrinsic-different) where the
confederate used an intrinsic reference frame, but the
reference object was placed in the position in which two
people appeared in the other conditions. If interlocutors
align reference frames independently of position then
participants should be more likely to use a reference frame

frame compared to an alternative reference frame,
regardless of whether the reference object was in the same
position or a different position on the match scene and target
