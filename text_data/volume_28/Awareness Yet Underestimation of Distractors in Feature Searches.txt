perhaps participants judge the quantity of distractors
based on how much colored area is created by the
distractors compared to the white space background.
Second, perhaps participants judge the quantity of items
based on how much background color separates the items.
Evidence for this hypothesis materialized in Experiment 1
- when the display became more crowded with distractors,
underestimates increased. Third, the target’s pop-out
effect caused the fovea to take the shortest path from
fixation to target (Findlay, 1997), thereby allowing
attention to focus on only a small portion of the screen. 1
                      Experiment 2
Experiments 2 and 3 were devoted to understanding the
underestimation effect from Experiment 1. Weber’s law
(see Falmagne, 1985) suggests that when estimating
frequencies, people and animals approximate with errors
that reflect an equal distribution of underestimations and
overestimations.
   One explanation for the underestimation in Experiment
1 is that the estimation is based on the amount of colored
area from the distractors versus the amount of white
spaced background color. If the distractors are bigger
than in Experiment 1 and therefore cover more of the
screen, perhaps participants would estimate that there
were more distractors; this would result in less
underestimation or possibly overestimation. According to
this hypothesis, overestimation would increase when the
size of the distractors decreased from Experiment 1.
