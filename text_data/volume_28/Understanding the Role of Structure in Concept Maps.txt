ing” of Ausubel’s cognitive learning theory (Ausubel, 1963),
which requires deliberate effort by learners to connect new
concepts to relevant preexisting concepts and propositions in
their own cognitive structures. The concept mapping pro-
cess is designed to externalize students’ concepts and propo-
sitions, facilitating their connection with newly acquired con-
cepts. Concept maps have been used by teachers to assess
students’ understanding, by students to compare their knowl-
edge and collaboratively refine their understanding, and by
experts for modeling and sharing knowledge.
   Concept maps are part of the tradition in cognitive psychol-
ogy and artificial intelligence of modeling concepts and their
relationships using graphs or networks. Examples include
the hierarchical network model (Collins & Quillian, 1969),
semantic memory (Tulving, 1972) and conceptual structures
(Ausubel, 1963), as well as more formal approaches such as           Figure 1: A simple concept map about glaciers, annotated
