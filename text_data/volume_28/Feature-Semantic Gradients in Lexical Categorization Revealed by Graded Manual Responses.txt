     The 125 animals can be mapped in a semantic space
with dimensionality of the number of relevant features
(dynamic, static, or full). Each category’s central tendency
point was determined by averaging the coordinates of its
constituent animals. In the resulting space, the most typical
animal exemplars (e.g., rabbit) of each category clustered
around their category’s central tendency point. On the other
hand, atypical animal exemplars (e.g., whale) of each
category were positioned much further away, often nearer to
the central tendency point of an entirely different animal
category (e.g., fish).
Manual Measures and Analyses

click, and only correct trials were subjected to analysis. Four
properties of manual output were extracted from these
mouse-movement data (see Fig. 1B). First, while not used in
the main analyses, the movement initiation time was
computed by measuring the number of samples before
mouse movement was detected (i.e., while the cursor was
motionless after the start of a trial). We use this measure of
latency below for an additional analysis.
     From the remaining trajectory representing output
motion, we calculated the number of time steps required to
finish the categorization (movement time), the total area
occupied by the trajectory compared to an assumed straight
line to the correct category (area), and the closest point in
the trajectory to the competing category (proximity to
incorrect category). The first measure, movement time, was
scored using sample counts extracted in RealBasic.2                                Figure 1B: Depiction of dependent measures.
