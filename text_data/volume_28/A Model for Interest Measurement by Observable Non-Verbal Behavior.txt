Several studies have suggested methods to suppose interest
and intention from non-verbal behavior (e.g., Chiu, 2000;
Stiefelhagen, 2002). Our device’s unique feature is that,
despite its compact size, it offers a “situation recognition”
function achieved by incorporating standards for detecting
meaningful behavior-related information (e.g., the distance at
which an object is visible to the subject) into the physical
characteristics of sensors. In many cases, research in
ubiquitous computing relies on devices with similar simple
