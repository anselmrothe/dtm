   Maye (2002) demonstrates that the eigenvectors
approximate the eigenmodes of the solution of the
system of ODEs describing the network dynamics
if the time course of the superposition coefficients
is sinusoidal and if there are strong differences in
the variances of each principal direction (expressed
by the magnitude of the corresponding eigenvalues).
Under these conditions the superposition coefficients
associated with each eigenvector correspond to the
order parameters associated with each eigenmode.
The temporally evolving order parameters, i.e., the
characteristic functions, are shown in Fig. 3e–f and
eigenvalues in Fig. 3a–d.
   For display purposes the eigenvectors were split
into the contributions from each activated layer and
reshaped to a matrix. To analyze the eigenmodes,
the signs of the components of each mode (visual-
ized by light and dark shades of grey) are taken into
account. Regions with the same sign are activated
together, while regions with opposite signs are ac-
tivated alternately. This shows which parts of the
stimulus are bound by synchronous activity of the
oscillators.
   Considering the eigenmode with the highest eigen-         Figure 4: Stimulus showing a Kanisza triangle (a)
