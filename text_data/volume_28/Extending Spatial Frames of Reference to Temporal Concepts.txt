    Integrating Spatial and Temporal Models
Although never fully integrated into a coherent model,
notions relevant to distinct intrinsic, deictic and extrinsic
frames of reference have been discussed to some extent in
research investigating the structure of temporal concepts.
Thus far, no systematic attempt to extend a tripartite spatial
frame of reference model to time has adequately described
the common features of spatial frameworks and temporal
concepts. Although Bender, Bernardo & Beller (2005) set

interesting relations between spatial and temporal concepts.

Perhaps, in the context of modern physics, this
conceptualization of time seems rather old-fashioned.
However, the notion that time itself is a backdrop, or
something understood to move forward, independent of
particular events embedded within it, is a very common
one.3 The extrinsic frame of reference is invoked with
expressions like “across time, the effect of variable X is
minimal” or “time flows on forever” where both examples
involve motion yet neither requires a deictic reference point.         Figure 8. Extrinsic Temporal Framework. Note that forward
