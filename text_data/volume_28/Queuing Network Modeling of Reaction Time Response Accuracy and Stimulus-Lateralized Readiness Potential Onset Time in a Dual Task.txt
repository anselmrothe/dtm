        Modeling of the Dependent Variables
   In the following we describe our use of the queuing
network modeling approach to model reaction time,
response accuracy, and S-LRP in a representative dual task
experimental study. To model this task, it is necessary to
determine the route of entities in the network first since all
tasks do not necessarily activate the same network routes.
Reaction time can be modeled by the time for the entities to
traverse through the routes; response accuracy and the S-
LRP onset time are modeled by the processing of entities in
the network.                                                           Figure 2: Illustration of the RT1 and RT2 (choice reaction time)
