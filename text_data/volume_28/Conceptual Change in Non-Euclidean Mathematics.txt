   Vosniadou and Verschaffel (1994) review several reasons
why researchers and philosophers may have been reluctant
to apply conceptual change theories to mathematics. One
reason is that mathematics proceeds by deductive rather
than empirical methods. Unlike explanatory models in

the discovery of new data, coherent mathematical systems
