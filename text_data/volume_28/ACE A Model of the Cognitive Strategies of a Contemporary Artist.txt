   The above facts state, in first-order predicate logic, that
IH’s status is that of an artist, that her goal is to be an artist
her entire life, that for her art must remain a calling, that her
artistic production is initially unpaid for, that she has a
photographic production, has a very active professional life,
and so on. For the computer simulation, these facts are put
in working memory at the start of the simulation, may
change during the simulation, and they serve to activate the
production rules that constitute the model of IH’s artistic
process; in turn, these rules may change the content of
working memory – the facts – as the simulation unfolds.
