passively carried on two routes through virtual Tübingen.
The transportation speed was two metres per second
corresponding to a fast walking speed. The two routes
presented in Figure 3 were the same as those used in a
previous study conducted in “Real Tübingen” (Meilinger,
2005; Meilinger & Knauff, submitted). The 120 m ‘long
