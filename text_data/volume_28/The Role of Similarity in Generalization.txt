spatial models of similarity, but also for feature-set models

   The present study challenges the assumption that
generalization is based directly on similarity. We describe
an experiment using a four-category classification task in
which subjects must attend to two dimensions
simultaneously, but must use these sources of information in
different ways. The principal finding is that multiple

                      Empirical Investigation
The assumption that generalization is based on similarity
was tested using a four-category probabilistic classification                                                      71

frequency and orientation. Frequency is predictive of
whether a stimulus lies in category A or C versus B or D,
whereas orientation is predictive of A or B versus C or D.
Therefore both dimensions are equally relevant to the task,
but subjects’ responses can be decomposed into components
that, normatively, each depend on only one dimension.
Each component is isomorphic to a two-category
classification task with one diagnostic and one irrelevant                                                         39
