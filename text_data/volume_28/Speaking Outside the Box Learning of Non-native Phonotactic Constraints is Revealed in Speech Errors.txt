Results and discussion
Recordings of the participants’ recitations were analyzed for
errors by the experimenter. A syllable was judged to
contain an error if a participant replaced one consonant with
another from the sequence.           Sequences in which a
participant began a syllable with an incorrect consonant and
self-corrected (e.g. hem Æ k-hem) were also coded as
errors. Vowel errors were not counted, nor were those
containing a consonant from outside the experiment. 212
consonant movement errors were identified.                                Figure 2: The syllable “ŋem” produced in earnest.
   The coding reliability was acceptable. A second coder,
unaware of the experimental conditions, listened to the
recordings of a subset of the produced syllables (2304
syllables). The coders agreed on 98% of the codes. As most
of these were agreements regarding the absence of an error,
it is useful to note that there were 45 syllables where both
coders agreed that an error was present. Of these, they
agreed on what the error was for 42 syllables. The coding
