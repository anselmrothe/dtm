result of our investigation of the Polish mental lexicon is
that, Polish, similar to English and Hebrew is characterised
by a combinatorial mental lexicon. However, different fac-
tors which condition the structure of the mental lexicon
have different ‘weightings’ in Polish as in comparison with
Hebrew and English. The factor of semantic compositional-
ity is crucial in determining the structure of the representa-
tion of words in Polish, similarly to English, but in contrast
with Hebrew (and Arabic). On the other hand, the factor of
the type of inflectional morpheme is important in the struc-
ture of the Polish lexicon, in that both types of inflectional
morphemes verbal and nominal seem to be represented in
the Polish lexicon. This contrasts with English, where nei-
ther verbal nor nominal inflections seem to be represented
as lexical processing structures.
