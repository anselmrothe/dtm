                              Abstract
   With certain masks used in Japanese Noh drama the apparent
   facial expression is a function of the vertical viewing angle.
   Rotation in depth produces changes in the retinal image of the
   face which viewers may confound with the distortion of fea-
   tures due to muscular action. In particular, as the mask is tilted
   forward it appears to smile, and as it is tilted backwards it ap-
   pears sad. We explored this effect in two experiments with a
   Noh mask and one with a 3-D model of a laser-scanned human
   face. Separate British and Japanese subject pools were used to
   investigate cross-cultural effects. The results confirmed a sys-
   tematic relationship between vertical angle of view and judged
   affect. For the Noh mask the effect was culturally moderated,
   whereas for the human face there was no significant effect of
   of culture. These results are discussed and interpreted in terms
   of perceptual strategies for processing familiar and unfamiliar
   faces.
                          Introduction
A variety of visual cues inform the viewer of affect. Mus-
cular action of the face (Ekman & Friesen, 1978), causing
feature displacement and consequent wrinkling of the skin,
conveys the most salient information. Visible changes in skin
hue caused by modulation of blood flow are also telling signs
to internal state. A further source of information about affect           Figure 1: Magojiro mask used in the Japanese Noh drama.

by an upright posture with the head held high and negative
