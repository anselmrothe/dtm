latencies for correct responses only. Because we expected a
large number of false alarms for F+/P+ foils, for these foils,
latencies for both correct and incorrect responses were used
in the analyses.
   Novices exhibited high overall accuracy for most of the
foils, correctly accepting Old targets and correctly rejecting
F-/P+, F-/P-, and F+/P- foils. They mostly false alarmed,
however, on F+/P+ foils. The latter finding is expected be-
cause F+/P+ foils were categorically indistinguishable from
Old targets, since both surface features and principled fea-
tures present in Old targets were also present in F+/P+ foils.
More specifically, results indicate that accuracy rates (i.e.,
hits for Old Targets and correct rejections for the other foils)
for F+/P- (M = 0.69, SD = 0.35), F-/P- (M = 0.93, SD =
0.20), F-/P+ (M = 0.97, SD = 0.16), and Old targets (M =
0.84, SD = 0.15) were significantly higher than chance (all
ts(22) > 9.4, ps<.001), whereas for F+/P+ (M = 0.36, SD =
0.26) accuracy was significantly lower than chance, t(22) = -
6.4, p < . 001. These results indicate that these participants
took the task seriously and were providing rather accurate
responses.
   Percentages of "Old" responses and latencies for novices
are presented in Figure 1. A one-way repeated measures

These data allow us to rule out Model 1 presented in Table 1

or absence of surface features. When surface features were
absent (F-/P- and F-/P+ foils) participants produced fast and
accurate "New" responses; however, when surface features
were present, novices did not always produce "Old" an-
swers. Rather, novices' responses were mediated by the
presence or absence of principled features. In particular,
