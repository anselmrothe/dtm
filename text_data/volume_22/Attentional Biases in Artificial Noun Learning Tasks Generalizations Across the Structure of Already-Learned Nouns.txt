   The second unanswered question is how do children ever
get a material-bias? We know that by three-years-of-age
children reliably demonstrate a bias to attend to material
substance when generalizing a novel name for a novel non
solid substance. However, this bias is not reliable before
30-months-of-age (Samuelson & Smith, 1999). The
developmental story for the material-bias may be the same
as that for the shape-bias, just more protracted in time. That
is, while children are rapidly learning names for solid things,
they are also encountering a smaller number of non sold
substances and their names. Each of these few substances
may have to be individually learned, as an exception,
without the boost from past learning given to names for
solid objects. But, as vocabulary grows, children may learn
enough names for non solid substances that the correlation
between the perceptual cues of non solidity and naming by
substance cohere to form a generalizable expectation about
how substances are named.
