positively correlated with S t-1 , M is positively correlated
with R t ,, and A i and M are subtracted from each other. This
creates negative relationship between the response R t and the
previous stimulus S t-1 .
Memory-Related Effects. The anchors are stored in
memory and decay only slowly with time. Therefore, the
mapping from stimuli to responses implicit in these anchors
can influence the performance hours and even days later.
   This paper argues in favor of the hypothesis that category
ratings are produced in a memory-based manner. A range of
category-rating phenomena seem to arise naturally from a set
of principles that are also consistent with a large body of
memory research. In so far as the ANCHOR model is suc-
cessfull, it illustrates the advantages of its integrative meth-
odology and the utility of general architectures for cognitive
modeling.
