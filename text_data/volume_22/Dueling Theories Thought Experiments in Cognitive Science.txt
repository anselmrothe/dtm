asking what will happen when this entire assembly is
dropped from the top of a tower.
   According to Galileo, Aristotle would be forced into a
contradiction. On the one hand, the combined system of
musket ball, cannon ball, and string is heavier than the
cannon ball alone. Therefore, the whole should fall faster
than its parts. On the other hand, the lighter musket ball
would try to fall more slowly than the heavier cannon ball,
and would act as a drag on the entire system. Therefore the
assembly should fall slower than its heaviest component, the
cannon ball. So we have a contradiction. If C is the falling
rate of the cannon ball, and S is the falling rate of the
combined system, then both S > C and S < C are true. So
Aristotle must be wrong. But the whole problem goes away
if we propose that everything falls at the same rate (S=C).
