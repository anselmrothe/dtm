   Recall that the label-as-attribute model also affords the
computation of specific probabilities of inductive
generalizations across stimuli that vary in overall similarity.
In future research, we plan to test these predictions of the
model with respect to naturalistic stimuli. Because it is
impossible to individuate features and to precisely calculate
featural overlap with complex naturalistic stimuli patterns, we
will manipulate similarity by "morphing" naturalistic pictures
into each other in a fixed number of steps.
