   One problem remains: if infants are using amount to dis-
criminate quantities, why don’t they dishabituate in the 4 vs
6 condition?
   Clearfield & Mix proposed that the 4 vs 6 displays might
simply contain too much visual complexity. There is no
question of comparison; the infants are overwhelmed by the
displays.
   The current model focuses instead on the way amount is
represented internally1 by the infants.
   If the perceived magnitude grows linearly with the actual
amount, then the 4 vs 6 condition should be more likely to
produce dishabituation than the 2 vs 3 condition, because the                               Actual Amount

appears to operate in parallel—unlike counting, it doesn’t
take twice as long when the number of objects is twice as
large. The magnitude effect appears here, too: estimation of
large numbers is less accurate. Estimation is only precise
within the subitizing range, up to 3 or 4 objects.

Animal studies (Eckhorn et al, 1988) have suggested an
intriguing hypothesis about the visual system: in certain
parts of the brain, cells which are responding to the same
