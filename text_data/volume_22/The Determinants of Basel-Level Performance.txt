   A category is defined by a list of features. Typically, some of these
features are unique to this category and some overlap with the defining
features of other categories. An optimal strategy is the shortest series of
tests on the features defining the category. We posit that SLIP
categorizers always use optimal strategies. We call redundant features,
or set of redundant features, the collection of features which,
individually, provide exactly the same information as to the category
membership of objects. In other words, testing one, two, or more
redundant features does not provide more information.
   Formally, we will say that a strategy is a series of sets of redundant
features. It has succeeded whenever all sets of redundant features have
been completed in a specific order. And a set of redundant features is
completed as soon as a test on the presence of one of its redundant
features has been performed.
   This usually happens after a succession of misses. The probability of

equal to Cj(1-S) + CjSRj that is, the practicability of set of redundant
features j or the probability that it will be completed after a single
attempt. S is the probability of a random slip (it was arbitrarily set to .5
throughout the simulations), and Cj is the probability that the target
features will be in the expected configuration (1 / number of
configurations). Thus the first term of ψ j is the probability that the
SLIP categorizer will guess the feature configuration correctly and that it
