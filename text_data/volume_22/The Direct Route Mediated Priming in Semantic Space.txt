test whether each context word generates significant variation
in vector elements between the k tests. Context words that are
reliable have k vectors with similar values so their rating do
no vary significantly across corpus sections. Context words
for which we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no variation
between corpus sections are retained.
   In these experiments we chose k=4 sections from the BNC,
each containing 10M words, and used the rather conservative
critical significance level 0.1. The procedure generated 536
context words.
