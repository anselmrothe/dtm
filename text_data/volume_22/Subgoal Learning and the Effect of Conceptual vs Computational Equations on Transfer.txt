SAMPLE OF PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A car manufacturer that makes a car called the Jupiter just came out with a new model, the Jupiter XL. Some of the
modifications made to the car are expected to improve the mpg (miles per gallon) rating of the car while other
modifications are not. The manufacturer has hired your firm, an independent consumer research firm, to test the new
model. To determine if there is any difference between the mpg rating of the old and new models, you collect a random
sample of 5 cars of the old model and 6 cars of the new model. You drive the cars along the same city route and record the
average mpg rating of each car. Here are the data:

SAMPLE OF CONCEPTUAL ELABORATION FOR THE COMPUTATIONAL T-TEST VARIANCE CALCULATION
A variance is a measure of how much the scores that make up a group deviate from the mean of a group. Even though it is
not obvious in the calculation below, part of the calculation of the variance involves computing the difference between each
score in a group and the mean for the group. Thus, a variance measures the variability of scores around a mean.
