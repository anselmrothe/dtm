Note. Mean Z score indicates the average of all suprathreshold voxels within the ROI. Active volume represents the
number of voxels within the ROI exceeding the significance threshold (∝= .05).

correlating with each encoding task (top row: face encoding; middle row: scene encoding; bottom row: sentence encoding).
The left side of each image corresponds to the left side of the brain. Regions demonstrating suprathreshold activation (∝ =
.05) during the task - control conditions are displayed in the red-to-yellow color scale.
Figure 3: Hemispheric asymmetry of activation across encoding tasks in the hippocampus and posterior mTL. The horizontal
axis indicates the Asymmetry Ratio (AR) calculated to show the hemispheric distribution of active suprathreshold voxels (∝
= .05) within each search region (AR = VoxelsR – VoxelsL / VoxelsR + VoxelsL).
