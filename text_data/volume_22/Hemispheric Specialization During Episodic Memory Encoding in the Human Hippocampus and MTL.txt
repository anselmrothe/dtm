Abstract
Hemispheric specialization during episodic memory encoding
was examined using three functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) tasks. Stimuli for the three tasks differed in the
degree to which they elicited subjects’ use of verbal and imagebased encoding strategies. Intentional encoding of visually
presented scenes, sentences, and faces was associated with
neural activity in the hippocampus and surrounding mesial
Temporal Lobe (mTL) structures. Across tasks, materialspecific lateralization of neural activity was observed in the
posterior mTL. In contrast, hippocampal activation did not
lateralize according to material type for two of the three tasks.
These results suggest a functional dissociation between the
hippocampus and other mTL subcomponents, and indicate that
material-specificity may not fully explain hemispheric
specialization in the mTL memory system.

Introduction
The human hippocampus and adjacent mesial temporal
lobe (mTL) structures are believed to subserve encoding
of new information into episodic memory: the form of
long-term memory that supports conscious recollection of
ongoing experiences (Squire and Zola-Morgan, 1991;
Tulving, 1998). The role of the mTL in long-term
memory processing has been investigated extensively
ever since Scoville and Milner (1957) reported profound
global anterograde amnesia in patient HM following
bilateral resection of the hippocampus, uncus, and
amygdala. Numerous studies of unilateral mTL resection
have documented that in left-language dominant patients,
resection of the left anterior temporal lobe consistently
produces verbal memory impairment, and although the
findings are less robust, that resection of the right, nonlanguage-dominant anterior temporal lobe produces
visuospatial memory impairment (Milner, 1958;
Blakemore and Falconer, 1967; Milner, 1968; JonesGotman, 1986). Such findings gave rise to the ipislateral
deficit model, or material-specific model, which asserts
that memory function lateralizes with cerebral function: in
left-language dominant individuals, the left hemisphere
mediates verbal memory, and the right hemisphere
visuospatial memory (Saykin, et al., 1992).

Neuroimaging results have not been entirely consistent
with lesion data regarding material-specificity during
memory processing. Although several studies have
demonstrated material-specific laterality in the frontal
lobes (Wagner, et al., 1998; McDermott, et al., 1999) and
in the mTL (Grady, et al., 1995; Stern, et al., 1996;
Nyberg, et al., 1996a; Kelly, et al., 1998; Detre, et al.,
1998), numerous studies suggest that hemispheric effects
depend upon the memory process being instantiated
(encoding vs. retrieval), rather than the type of stimulus
material (Tulving, et al., 1994; Schacter, et al., 1995;
Nyberg, et al., 1996b). Other studies suggest that the
right and left medial temporal regions respond
differentially to novel and familiar stimuli (Tulving, et al.,
1996; Fujii, et al., 1997), or that laterality of activation
varies with depth of encoding (Nyberg, et al., 1996a;
Martin, et al., 1997), success of encoding (Casasanto, et
al., 2000), or with task parameters such as the stimulus
presentation rate (Kelly, et al., 1998).
The present study examined fMRI activation during
intentional encoding of unfamiliar faces, complex visual
scenes, and four-word declarative sentences. The goal of
the study was to determine whether activation in the mTL
lateralizes according to the type of stimulus material
presented. Other variables that may affect hemispheric
laterality, such as stimulus novelty, task instructions, and
stimulus presentation parameters, were held constant
across the three tasks. It was hypothesized that encoding
of unfamiliar faces would be associated with preferential
activation of right-hemisphere mTL structures, encoding
of sentences with preferential activation of lefthemisphere mTL structures, and encoding of complex
visual scenes, which are amenable to both verbal and
visuospatial encoding, would be associated with bilateral
mTL activation.

Materials and Methods
Subjects
Healthy, normal volunteers between the ages of 18 and 30
were consecutively recruited from the University of
Pennsylvania community, and paid $20 for their

participation (Scenes task: N=19, 6 male; Sentence Task:
N=15, 6 male; Face task: N=6, 2 male). All subjects were
right-handed by self-report, and all of the sentence task
participants were native speakers of English.

Cognitive Task Design
For each encoding task, subjects viewed a total of 60
stimuli, presented over six 40-second blocks (10 stimuli
per block, 3500 ms presentation, 500 ms ISI) while lying
supine in the bore of the MRI scanner. Stimulus blocks
alternated with blocks of control images, matched with
target stimuli for size, color, luminosity, and presentation
rate. Scene stimuli were obtained from a commercial
library of digitized images (PhotoDisc, Inc., 1995, Seattle,
WA). (See figure 1a.) Face stimuli were constructed
from University of Pennsylvania ID card photographs.
Consent for use of the photographs was solicited via an email advertisement to approximately 3000 members of
the University community, and only photographs from
those providing consent were used. The face photographs
were equated for size and image quality, and were
cropped so as to include the brow, eyes, nose, and mouth,
but exclude ears, hair, and any extraneous objects such as
eyeglasses or jewelry. (See figure 1b.) Sentence stimuli
were four-word, active, declarative sentences culled from
children’s books estimated to be at the fifth-grade reading
level, and presented in Chicago 24-point font. Simple
sentences were chosen so that this task could be
administered to neurologically impaired patients with
cognitive deficits, although all data reported presently
pertain to healthy subjects. (See figure 1c.) For the faces
and scenes tasks, the control images were visual noise
patterns, created by transforming a stimulus image with a
random retiling algorithm iterated 10,000 times. For the
sentence task, the control image was a set of four strings,
composed of asterisks, of the same mean length as the
stimulus words. Stimulus presentation routines were
developed on a Macintosh Powerbook (Apple Computer,
Cupertino, CA), using Psyscope software (Cohen, et al.,
1993). Stimuli were back-projected using an Epson LCD
projector (model ELP-5000) onto a viewing screen
positioned approximately 7 feet from the subject’s eyes,
which was easily visible via a mirror mounted in the
scanner head coil. Subjects were instructed to remember
the stimuli for a recognition test immediately following
each encoding task, and to attend to the control images,
but not to memorize them. The sequence of cognitive
tasks was pseudorandomly varied across subjects.
For each recognition test, subjects viewed all sixty of
the stimuli presented during the preceding encoding task,
randomly intermixed with an equal number of novel
distractors. While still lying in the scanner bore, subjects
were required to distinguish studied stimuli from
unstudied distractors, and to respond using a two-button
box interfaced with the Macintosh computer via fiberoptic cable. The forced-choice recognition test was selfpaced, and subjects were informed that both the speed and
accuracy of their responses was of interest. Functional

imaging data were collected during encoding, but not
during recognition testing.
Image Acquisition
Imaging data were collected on a 1.5 Tesla GE Signa
MRI scanner equipped with a fast gradient system for
echo-planar imaging, using a standard quadrature
radiofrequency (RF) whole-head coil. Foam padding was
used to comfortably restrict head motion. Sagittal and
axial T1-weighted structural images were obtained for
each subject. Prior to functional activation, data were
acquired for correction of image distortion due to static
susceptibility effects (Alsop, 1995).
T2*-sensitive,
gradient echo, echoplanar functional images were then
obtained with BOLD contrast (TR = 2000 ms, TEeff = 50
ms) in 18 to 20 contiguous 5-mm-thick axial slices, in a
24-cm field of view with a 64x64 acquisition matrix,
resulting in a nominal pixel resolution of 3.75 x 3.75 x 5
mm. For each encoding task, functional activation was
measured over a single 240-scan run consisting of six 80second task/control cycles. Raw imaging data were
extracted onto digital audiotape (DAT) for subsequent
analysis.

Image Processing and Data Analysis
Imaging data were reconstructed offline on SUN
UltraSparc workstations, (SUN Microsystems, Mountain
View, CA) using software developed in Interactive Data
Language (Research Systems, Boulder, CO). Raw data
were corrected for static susceptibility-induced
distortions, and a motion-compensation algorithm
targeting translational artifacts occurring along three
orthogonal vectors was applied to each data set. Data
were convolved in space using a three-dimensional
nonisotropic gaussian kernel (full width half-maximum
[FWHM] = 8 X 8 X 10 mm). Using SPM97 software
(Wellcome Laboratories, London, UK), a linear model for
temporally autocorrelated observations was applied
voxelwise to each data set. FMRI signal at each voxel
was correlated to a reference function obtained by
convolving the square wave describing the task/control
alternation with an estimate of the subject’s hemodynamic
response function (Friston, et al., 1994). Statistical
parametric maps (SPMs) were generated for each
subject’s encoding runs. Multisubject SPMs were then
constructed for each task using the random effects model,
with SPMt maps as input. Normalized group maps were
viewed in Talairach atlas space, with across-subject
averaged functional images superimposed on a standard
pseudosubject structural image. Cognitive subtraction
(task condition – control condition) produced a difference
image showing activation associated stimulus encoding
for each task.
Anatomical regions were defined using the SPL
anatomy browser (Kikinis, et al., 1996), interfaced with
IDL and SPM98 software. Based on these anatomical
regions, an mTL region of interest (ROI) was defined
comprising the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and

fusiform gyrus.
Although whole-brain data were
collected, secondary analysis was restricted to this a-priori
defined region of interest. Only activation exceeding a
mapwise statistical threshold (∝ = .05) was considered.
Suprathreshold activation was quantified for each
lateralized anatomical structure within the mTL ROI, by
counting the number of active suprathreshold voxels. The
hemispheric asymmetry of activation correlating with
each cognitive task was determined by calculating an
asymmetry ratio for each search region (AR = VoxelsR –
VoxelsL / VoxelsR + VoxelsL). The significance of
activation asymmetry was assessed by comparing the
proportion of active suprathreshold voxels in each
lateralized search region, using a standard test for the
independence of two proportions (Hinkle, et al., 1988).
Recognition test performance was assessed by
computing a discriminability index for each subject
(Discriminability = (% hits) – (% false positives)).

Results
Behavioral Results
Performance on the post-scan recognition tests confirmed
that subjects were able to encode target stimuli
satisfactorily. Results show that all subjects performed
significantly above chance on all tasks. Subjects’ mean
discriminability score for the face task was 0.50 (SD+/.20, t = 6.13, p = .0008), for the scene task 0.80 (SD +/.17, t = 19.18, p = .0001), and for the sentence task 0.70
(SD+/- .17, t = 13.97, p = .0001).

Imaging Results
Suprathreshold activation associated with encoding was
found in the mTL region of interest across all three tasks.
Table 1 presents the Talairach locations of peak activation
during encoding for each anatomical structure within the
ROI. Figure 2 presents selected slices of the multisubject
functional activation maps for each encoding task. It was
observed, for the face and scene tasks, that active
suprathreshold voxels in the parahippocampus were
contiguous with those in the fusiform gyrus, constituting a
“cluster” of active voxels. Hippocampal activations
formed separate clusters. Therefore, for analysis of
hemispheric effects, the region of interest was divided
into two subregions: a hippocampal ROI comprising the
hippocampus proper (horn of Ammon, subiculum, and
dentate gyrus), and a posterior mTL ROI comprising the
parahippocampus (perirhinal and entorhinal cortices) and
the fusiform gyrus. Figure 3 shows the hemispheric
asymmetry of activation across tasks, as indicated by the
asymmetry ratio computed for each search region. For
the face task, bilateral activation was found in the
hippocampus, nonsignificantly greater left than right (AR
= -0.27, ns), and in the posterior mTL, significantly
greater right than left (AR= 0.33, p < .05). For the scene
task, unilateral activation was found in the left
hippocampus (AR= -1.0, p < .001), and bilateral
activation was found in the posterior mTL (AR = -0.03,

ns). For the sentence task, unilateral left hemisphere
activation was found both in the hippocampus (AR= -1.0,
p < .001) and in the posterior mTL (AR= -1.0, p < .05).

Discussion
Across encoding tasks, the pattern of activation in the
posterior mTL is consistent with the material-specific
hypothesis. Greater right than left hemisphere activation
was found during face encoding, nearly symmetrical
bilateral activation during scene encoding, and
exclusively left-sided activation during sentence
encoding. The hemispheric laterality of activation can be
interpreted as “code-specific” (McDermott, et al., 1999):
that is, varying with the extent to which the stimuli can be
processed using verbal and nonverbal representational
codes (Paivio, 1991), the neural substrates of which have
been shown to be differentially lateralized (Kounios and
Holcomb, 1994; Kelly, et al., 1998).
Surprisingly, we observed that within task, the laterality
of activation in the posterior mTL was not always
consistent with the laterality of activation in the
hippocampus. Hippocampal activation was bilateral
during face encoding, and exclusively left-sided during
scene and sentence encoding. In contrast to the materialspecific activation observed in the posterior mTL,
activation in the hippocampus during face and scene
encoding did not lateralize according to the materialspecific hypothesis. Previous studies have reported
activation of left mTL structures during intentional
encoding across all material types (Martin, 1997; Kelly, et
al., 1998). However, the dissociation we observe between
the laterality of activation in the hippocampus and
posterior mTL structures during face and scene encoding
has not been reported previously. It may be possible to
account for our findings in terms of the neural
connectivity of the mTL and surrounding structures.
Hemispheric specialization for verbal and nonverbal
materials has been well established in the neocortex.
Because the parahippocampus receives direct input from
the cortical sensory association areas, whereas the
hippocampus receives the majority of its cortical input
indirectly, via the parahippocampus (Eichenbaum and
Bunsey, 1995), material-specific hemispheric effects may
be observed more readily in parahippocampus than in the
hippocampus. Furthermore, hemispheric specialization in
the hippocampus may be masked due to integration of the
right and left hippocampi, which are reciprocally
connected via the hippocampal commissure.
Our findings are compatible with the two-component
model of mTL memory processing developed by
Eichenbaum and colleagues (1994), which suggests a
functional dissociation between the hippocampus and
posterior mTL structures.
Specifically, the model
implicates the parahippocampal region in the
intermediate-term storage and maintenance of individual
mental representations, and the hippocampus in the
formation of relations among mental representations.

This model, based primarily on lesion studies in humans
and animals, is supported by recent human
electrophysiological data that show a temporal dissociation
between parahippocampal and hippocampal activation
during encoding (Fernandez, et al., 1999), and by PET data
that show increased hippocampal activation during
relational vs. non-relational memory processing (Henke, et
al., 1999). Individual mental representations may be either
verbal or nonverbal, whereas relational representations
may combine verbal and nonverbal codes. Although the
Eichenbaum model makes no explicit predictions regarding
material-specificity, it provides a theoretical framework in
which to consider our finding that the posterior mTL
shows greater sensitivity to material type than the
hippocampus.

Conclusions
Whereas hemispheric laterality during memory encoding in
the posterior mTL appears to be strongly code-dependent,
laterality in the hippocampus may depend upon other
variables, as well. Within the frontal lobes, hemispheric
effects have been shown to depend upon material type for
certain anatomical structures, and upon cognitive set
(encoding vs. retrieval) for other nearby structures
(McDermott, et al., 1999). This pattern may be extensible
to the mesial temporal lobes. Future studies may identify
variables affecting the laterality of activation in specific
mTL subcomponents, and may help to reconcile
neuropsychological findings that suggest material-specific
hippocampal involvement in memory processing with
conflicting neuroimaging results.
