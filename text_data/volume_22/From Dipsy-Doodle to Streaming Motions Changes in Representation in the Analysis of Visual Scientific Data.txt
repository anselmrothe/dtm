the other approximately 10 in this area. One of the astrono-
mers, hereafter referred to as A1, focuses on conducting and
analyzing astronomical observations, and has an expertise in
ring galaxies; the other, hereafter referred to as A2, combines
teaching with primarily theoretical astronomical research and
model construction. The astronomers have been collaborat-
ing for some years, although they do not frequently work
physically alongside one another (i.e., work simultaneously
at the same computer screen to examine data).
   The participants in the second domain were two scientists
in neuropsychology, one a postdoctoral researcher (B1) who
has been in the field over 3 years, the other a graduate re-
searcher (B2) who has been in the field for 1 year. The scien-
tists work in a renowned national US research institute and
are involved in developing a new methodology for analyzing
fMRI brain data. They frequently work simultaneously at the
same computer screen to examine data.
