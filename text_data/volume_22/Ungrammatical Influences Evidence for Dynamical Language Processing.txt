   A distinguishing feature of self-organizing models of cog-
   nitive structure is that they permit incompatible struc-
   tures to coexist at least temporarily. Here we report
   on a connectionist model of natural language process-
   ing which appears to temporarily construct incoherent
   structures. We then describe two reading-time studies
   which reveal people exhibiting the same tendency. In
   particular, both networks and people show sensitivity
   to the irrelevant structural interpretations of the under-
   lined phrases in (1) and (2).
      (1) We did not think the company would re truck
      drivers without consulting the union rst.
      (2) The manager watched the waiter served pea
      soup by the trainee.
   This kind of sensitivity is absent in parsing models which
   treat grammatical constraints as absolute because such
