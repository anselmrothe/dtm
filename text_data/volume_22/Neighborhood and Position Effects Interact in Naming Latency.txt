increases. Thus, if there is a systematic difference in the ex-
pected number of on-units among the conditions, those tar-
gets with more on-units may be unduly penalized. Examina-
tion of the output targets for the various test categories reveals
that indeed, those in the back position conditions have more
on-units than the front position targets, as shown in Figure 7.
This means that the words in the back position systematically
have one more phoneme than the front-position test words.

is actually a bit surprising since the networks produce output
in parallel, and thus would not have any time to “correct”
for later-position errors. The network results instead reflect
the finding that English words are more consistent in endings
than they are in onsets (Treiman et al., 1995).
