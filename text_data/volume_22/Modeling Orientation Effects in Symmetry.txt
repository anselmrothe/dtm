 correct but contains errors (dotted lines) and has low

   Figure 3 shows how this may occur. In the original figure
(A), the mapping created by MAGI is only partial, and the
resulting mapping has low systematicity and some incorrect

visual structure to produce the correct mapping at this
orientation (i.e., it does not have a good intrinsic axis).
However, this partial mapping is sufficient to produce a
