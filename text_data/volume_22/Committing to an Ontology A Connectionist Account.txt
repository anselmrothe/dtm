Procedure The procedure used was a forced choice task.
The child were shown an exemplar (i.e., the Teema) and told
                                                                         0.75
its name (“this is the Teema”). The child was then presented
with pairs of objects, a shape match and a material match,
                                                                   prop.
and asked “Can you show me the Teema?”. Each child was
presented with the Traditional set of one exemplar and the         shape 0.5
Ontology Violating set of the other. Half of the children          choices
were assigned at random to judge the Traditional version of

other. The two exemplars were presented in separate blocks.
Each shape-match/material-match pair was presented twice in
random order for a total of 12 trials. The order of the sets                0

respectively. In the Traditional sets, children’s performance
replicates previous findings: they present a clear shape bias   show increased attention to the material of non-solid exem-
for the trials with solid exemplars (Experiment 3A) and         plars (Experiment 3B). In the Ontology Violating sets, as

the network simulations predicted, children’s shape bias de-
creased to chance levels in solid trials and increased to above
chance in the non-solid trials.
   Although these results are consistent with a bias in chil-
dren to extend category names only within ontological
boundaries, there is an alternative explanation. Children’s
preference for the same-solidity item could be a result of the
way the ontological violating choices alter the exemplar-test
items’ similarity. For example, in the case of the solid ex-
emplar, the material match matches in both material and
solidity, while the shape match now only matches in shape
(and imperfectly at that, given the change of solidity). While
we can’t be sure of which explanation is the case in children,
we know for a fact that it is more than just similarity for the
networks.
                       Conclusions
   Learning a first language is a hard problem. However, the
task appears less daunting when we consider that the kinds
of words children know early present an organized structure.
A smart learner could learn to exploit this structure to its
advantage. In this paper we have shown that a simple statis-
tical learner, with no other mechanisms than associative
learning and generalization by similarity, will learn shape
and material biases to match the systematic regularities pre-
sent in its training set. We have also documented a new
bias, one which could be taken as evidence of an underlying
ontology, but that also makes sense in terms of the statisti-
cal regularities present in the language. This suggests that
word-learning biases and constraints could be a product of
learning. While the evidence presented here is consistent
with this account, it does not provide conclusive proof; the
regularities found in children’s vocabularies could be a prod-
uct of pre-existing biases. However, the fact that we have
demonstrated the computational plausibility of the learning
account and simple parsimony suggest that this is not the
case.
