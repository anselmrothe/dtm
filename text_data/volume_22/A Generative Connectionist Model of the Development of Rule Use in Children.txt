   changes on the dimensional change card sort (DCCS), which

   experienced networks (akin to 3-year-old children) behave as
   if following a pair of rules; and the most experienced
   networks (akin to 5-year-olds) behave as if following two
   pairs of rules. Analysis of the networks’ activation levels                             Figure 1: Stimuli for DCCS
