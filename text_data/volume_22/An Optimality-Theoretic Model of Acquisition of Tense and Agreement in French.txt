Abstract
We present a novel theoretical model of multiple stages i n
the acquisition of tense and agreement in Child French.
First, we show that tense and agreement inflection follow
independent courses of acquisition. Over the three stages of
development attested in the data, tense production starts
and ends at near-adult levels, but suffers a “dip” in production at the second stage. Agreement develops linearly, going roughly from none to 100% over the same time. This
profile suggests a competition between tense and agreement at the second stage which is naturally expressed i n
terms of constraint violability and constraint re-ranking
(Optimality Theory, Prince & Smolensky, 1993). By incorporating the further mechanism of partial rankings of
constraints, our analysis successfully predicts, over three
stages, the frequency with which children use tensed, agreeing, and nonfinite verbs.

The Attested Development of Tense and
Agreement in French
It is cross-linguistically well-attested that young children
(around the age of 2) often produce simple sentences with a
non-finite root (verb) form (NRFs), ungrammatical in the
adult language, while also producing adult-like finite verbs
with tense and agreement marking (Wexler, 1994, 1998,
inter alia). What has been previously overlooked, however,
is whether the distinct inflectional categories of tense and
(person/number) agreement develop independently over time.
A detailed analysis of spontaneous speech production data
from three French children from the CHILDES Database
(MacWhinney & Snow, 1985) provides strong evidence that
the two categories indeed follow a different path of development.1

The data we report on in this paper is part of a larger project
aimed at studying the acquisition of tense and agreement

As a preliminary step of analysis the relevant files were
analyzed by hand and classified into PLU (Predominant
Length of Utterance) stages (Vainikka, Legendre & Todorova, 1999). This independent measure refines the traditional observation that children progress through one-word,
two-word, and multi-word stages and has proven better suited
to capture syntactic development than the well-known MLU
measure (Brown, 1973).
French presents specific challenges for a study of the development of finiteness because the overwhelming majority
of verbs used by young children belong to the first conjugation class (‘-er verbs) which displays considerable homophony across morphological person inflections. In the absence
of an overt subject (which is frequently omitted by young
children) it cannot be determined whether a given phonetic
form like [dãs] danse ‘dance’ in the present tense carries
correct agreement in person and number. However, clitic
subject pronouns in French (e.g., je ‘I’) provide a diagnostic
crosslinguistically (Vainikka, Legendre & Todorova 1999). We
have done in-depth work on transcripts from eight different
children at this stage of development, covering English,
French, Polish, Russian, and Swedish. Further analyses are underway as well. We should point out that while the conclusions
drawn in this paper are made on the basis of data from (only)
three children, we believe (following well-established tradition
in the study of the acquisition of syntax by children) that examining a small number of subjects in detail allows us to uncover
complexity that would be missed in a necessarily less detailed
overview of a larger group of subjects. Furthermore, there i s
strong evidence to suggest that syntactic acquisition proceeds
in a highly constrained and species-universal manner. Given
this, we do not expect to find a great deal of variation from child
to child, increasing the likelihood that the results reached o n
the basis of these three children will generalize across Frenchspeaking children.

for agreement marking: Following Lambrecht (1981), Suñer
(1988), Legendre (1999), and others, we take subject clitics
to be an overt realization of agreement, rather than considering them to be overt subjects. Agreeing with Pierce (1992),
we consider them to provide a reliable diagnostic for finiteness in child French. We also count verbs with a finite morphological shape which occur with an appropriate overt subject as agreeing.
The widespread tendency of young children to omit auxiliaries raises another issue with respect to coding. A past
participle with no auxiliary has an adjectival use in adult
French, and in the absence of an auxiliary it is nearly impossible to determine which use was intended by the child
(adjective, main verb, or past tense). Similarly, a bare infinitive might represent either the future tense with no auxiliary, or a true NRF. We have coded only forms of the verb
consisting of both the auxiliary and the participle/infinitive
as instantiations of tense. Participles and infinitives used
without the auxiliary were coded as non-finite forms.
We calculated the proportions of forms morphologically
inflected for tense and/or agreement out of the total number
of verbs produced by each child at each attested PLU stage. It
is well-known that the third person singular and present
tense forms are the first to appear in child productions, and
for a time may be the only finite forms produced by the
child. Furthermore, young children tend to overuse third
person singular and present tense forms. This suggests that
these serve as “default” forms, making it unclear whether a
third person singular (3sg) verb is truly agreeing with a 3sg
subject or whether it lacks agreement and is taking on an
“elsewhere” form (see also Ferdinand, 1996). To determine
the proportion of children’s verbs which actually show

agreement (and not a default form), we have counted only
non-3sg and non-present forms as unambiguously showing
agreement, and we present our results in these terms.
Tables 1–2 below summarize our findings relating to the
use of tense and agreement, respectively, by each child. The
numbers in Table 1 show the proportion of tensed verbs
which had non-present forms, those in Table 2 show the
proportion of verbs which appeared with non-3sg agreement.
Of the verbs showing present tense or 3sg agreement, some
presumably reflect a default form, while others reflect correct
3sg agreement or present tense. We will estimate the proportion of correct vs. default tense/agreement marking following the discussion below.
The combined results are graphed in Figure 1 to illustrate
the development of tense and agreement across the attested
PLU stages.
Because the figures in Table 1 are the percentages of overall utterances that contain non-present tense forms in Table
1, we do not ever expect these figures to reach 100%. To
understand what level of production these percentages correspond to, we need to know what adult-like production of
non-present tense forms is. To determine this, we ran a
similar count on the adult utterances in two of the
CHILDES files (Philippe 11 and Grégoire 9) in order to get
at least a reasonable estimate of what adult use of non-3sg
and non-present forms is. These results are given in Table 3.
Assuming that adults always produce finite verbs and
given that they produce non-present tense verbs roughly
31% of the time, we can reasonably take the children’s 35%
production of non-present tense (out of unambiguously
tensed verbs) at stage 3b to be an adult-like level of production. On the other hand, we can also reasonably assume that
the 4% production of non-3sg (of agreeing verbs) at stage
3b indicates that the children are not realizing agreement and
are using a default (3sg) form.
As we can see from Tables 1–2 and Figure 1 below,
tense and agreement undergo distinct patterns of development. At stage 3b, the proportion of agreeing forms in the
children’s speech is negligible—it is clear that they are not
yet using agreement. At the same time, the proportion of
tensed forms is sufficiently high to allow us to conclude
that tense is already in regular use. At the subsequent stage,
4b, agreement emerges at a significant, thought not yet
adult-like, level. Notice that at stage 4b, tense suffers a dip

in production compared to stage 3b. This interesting correlation between increased use of agreeing forms and decreased
use of tensed forms suggests a temporary competition between the two before they both stabilize at the subsequent
stage, 4c.
The dissociation between tense and agreement is especially striking in the child production of periphrastic tenses;
throughout stage 3b, Grégoire and Stéphane produce numerous instances of the past and future tenses; however, the
auxiliary that appears in these utterances is always 3rd person singular: Papa et Maman est parti ‘Father and Mother
is gone’ (Grégoire 2;0.5).
Turning now to NRFs, we found that children produce
steadily fewer of these as their age/PLU stage increases. Our
findings are given in Table 4 and graphed in Figure 2.
Comparing Figures 1–2, we can see that the reduction in
the use of NRFs over time appears to be inversely correlated
with the development of agreement: in a sense, the NRF
pattern is the mirror image of the pattern we have found for
agreement (Table 2). By contrast, the decrease in NRFs does
not appear to correlate with the development of tense; compare Figure 2 to the previous graph of tense (Figure 1). This
observation is important in light of existing claims that
relate the occurrence of NRFs to the development of Tense.
For example, Wexler (1994) has proposed that the underspecification of Tense is responsible for the presence of
NRFs (his ‘root infinitives’) in young children’s speech.
Our findings suggest at the very least that the development
of agreement is also involved; the profile of NRFs is not
directly linked to the profile of realization of tense.

An Optimality-Theoretic Model of
Development
Informally, the main idea behind our proposal is the following: At Stage 3b, constraints requiring realization of finiteness compete with constraints on economy of structure,

Figure 3. Candidates for input containing past tense and
1st singular agreement features
sometimes resulting in the production of finite verbs and
sometimes resulting in the production of NRFs. At Stage
4b, tense and agreement compete for a single structural position; a functional projection which can realize the features
either of tense or of agreement (but not both). At Stage 4c,
two positions are available, allowing both tense and agreement features to be realized without competition.
Formally, the constraints which require parsing of the
functional features (PARSET(ense), PARSEA(greement)) rise
in the ranking relative to a fixed hierarchy of constraints
penalizing structure. PARSET and PARSEA are Faithfulness
constraints ensuring that what is expressed (the output of the
grammar) differs minimally from what is intended (the input
to the grammar).
Assuming, as is standard in generative syntax since Pollock (1989), that the presence of inflectional categories is
indicative of phrase structure above that instantiating lexical
categories, the constraints penalizing structure can be stated
as *F (‘No functional heads’) and *F 2 (‘No pairs of functional heads’) with the invariable ranking *F2 >> *F.2
There are four candidate structures relevant to this analysis
(we assume that the input to every evaluation has tense and
agreement features subject to Faithfulness constraints). They
are given in Figure 3 along with examples and the constraints each satisfies and violates.
The key to our proposal is the ability of the Faithfulness
constraints to “float” over a certain range in the ranking (unlike the Economy of Structure constraints *F, *F 2 discussed
above, which remain fixed in their relative ranking) during
the course of development. Formally, the model relies on
partial constraint ranking (Reynolds, 1994; Anttila 1997,
Nagy & Reynolds, 1997) and can predict not only that we
see variation in outputs of the developing grammar, but also
with what frequency we will see each output. As illustrated
in Figure 4, a partial ordering (a) translates into a set of

F2 >> F invariably because they are part of a Power Hierarchy: F2 is a local conjunction of two instances of *F (Legendre,
Smolensky & Wilson, 1998; Smolensky, 1995).

rankings (b). We see that a different candidate structure wins
under each of the rankings in (b); under ranking (bi), a candidate with a nonfinite verb wins, while under ranking (bii) a
candidate with a tensed verb (that is, with a functional projection to realize tense features). For any given evaluation, a
grammar with the partial ordering in (a) will use one of the
rankings, either (bi) or (bii), to determine the optimal candidate. Thus, in any given evaluation, either a tensed verb or
an untensed verb will win the competition. We make the
further assumption that either of the two rankings has an
equal chance of being called upon during an evaluation (for a
different assumption see Boersma, 1997). This means that
there is a 50% chance that ranking (bi) will be used, yielding
an untensed verb as the optimal candidate. To put it another
way, we expect to see the untensed candidate 50% of the
time (and to see the tensed candidate the other 50% of the
time).
This example illustrates well the nature of the conflict
underlying the development of finiteness. Functional features can only be parsed (satisfying the Faithfulness constraints PARSET and/or PARSEA) if the Economy of Structure constraints (*F and possibly *F2) are violated. The conflict is resolved by ranking. If Economy of Structure dominates Faithfulness, then functional features cannot be parsed
and the optimal candidate will be a nonfinite form acting as
a main verb (an NRF). If Faithfulness dominates Economy
of Structure, then functional features will be parsed into a
functional head, yielding a finite form as the optimal candidate (recall that either tensed or agreeing forms count as
“finite” under our terminology).
This analysis, set in OT and using partial rankings, also
unifies two otherwise incompatible views on the acquisition
of syntactic structure. On one side, the Full Competence
Hypothesis (or "Strong Continuity"; see, e.g., Poeppel &
Wexler 1993) proposes that the full adult-like syntactic
structures are available to the child's grammar essentially
from the outset of acquisition. On the other side, the Structure Building Hypothesis (or "Weak Continuity"; see, e.g.,
Vainikka 1993/4) proposes that a child initially uses syntactic structures much simpler than those of the adult language,
over time adding complexity until the adult stage is reached.
Our analysis shares with Full Competence the idea that the
full range of the adult grammar is available to children; all
of the constraints are present (but ranked in a non-adult
way), the difference between a child grammar and an adult
grammar is of the same type as the difference between two
adult grammars (i.e., differing rankings among constraints),
and the underlying representations used by children and
adults draw from the same set of grammatical features. Simultaneously, our analysis shares with the Structure Build-

ing Hypothesis the view that children's representations are
simpler than adult structures to begin with and become more
complex over time. On our analysis, this is not due to a
lack of access to adult grammatical constructs, but rather to
a low ranking of Faithfulness constraints relative to constraints prohibiting structure.
The actual course of development of finiteness we propose
here is an expanded version of this basic re-ranking schema.
We will see that the PARSE constraints advance separately, at
one point (Stage 3) with PARSET invariably outranking
PARSEA with the result that the observed finite forms will
be tensed, but non-agreeing.

A Stage-By-Stage Analysis of Development
We begin with stage 3b, where the rankings are as in Figure
5, yielding the 3 rankings given in (a–c).
At stage 3b, PARSET spans a range allowing it to sometimes outrank *F 2, and sometimes be outranked by *F.
PARSEA is always outranked by both *F and *F2.
Of the three rankings, only (c) results in an NRF; under
this ranking, it is better not to have a functional projection
(satisfying *F) than to parse tense (which would satisfy
PARSET) or agreement (which would satisfy PARSEA). This
means that we expect NRFs to comprise one-third of a
child’s utterances at Stage 3b.
The other two rankings yield a tensed form, but without
agreement. Under these two rankings, PARSET outranks *F,
making it more important to realize tense in a functional
projection than to avoid functional projections. Neither ranking yields an agreeing form because this would require two
functional projections, and PARSEA is under both rankings
outranked by *F 2. Thus, we expect tensed forms (without
agreement) to comprise the other two-thirds of a child’s utterances at stage 3b.
What we actually observed (Table 4) was 33% NRFs and
67% finite forms, exactly the prediction. Of the finite forms,
we counted only non-present forms, and found 35% such
forms (Table 1). Recall that when this is compared to the
adult production of 31% non-present forms (Table 3), it appears that all finite utterances the children produce at Stage 3
are tensed. Looking at agreement (Table 2), we found very
few (4%) non-3sg forms, compared to an adult rate of 38%.
So (with a minimal degree of idealization) we find that all
finite child utterances at Stage 3 are tensed but non-agreeing,
as predicted.
In Stage 4b, PARSEA advances to a position equal to
PARSET; both now sometimes outrank *F 2, and can sometimes be outranked by *F. In some rankings PARSET outranks PARSEA, while in others PARSEA outranks PARSET.
These ranges yield the 12 rankings given in Figure 6.

Figure 7. Stage 4c
Two of these rankings, (a–b), yield verb forms which are
both tensed and agreeing (that is, essentially adult forms),
since under those rankings it is more important to realize
both tense and agreement than it is to avoid having two
functional projections. Another two rankings, (c–d), yield
NRFs, since under these rankings it is more important not
to have any functional projections than it is to realize either
tense or agreement. The rest of the rankings (e–l) yield finite
forms which are either tensed (when PARSET outranks
PARSEA) or agreeing (when PARSEA outranks PARSET), but
not both. 3
This predicts, then, that only 17% (2 out of 12) of the
verb forms uttered at Stage 4b should be NRFs. We observed (Table 4) 19% NRFs, very close to the prediction. Of
the remaining verbs, all finite, 17% are predicted to be adultlike (with both tense and agreement), the remaining forms
having only one or the other (33% of them with only tense,
33% of them with only agreement). Again, this lines up
well with the observations. Further, of the finite verbs we
predict 19% non-present forms and observe 15% (Tables 1
__________
3

Note that a higher degree of constraint overlap yields a
larger number of possible rankings for each evaluation, but this
does not mean that the child must “exert more effort to choose”
where the number of possible rankings is large. If, metaphorically, the child’s task before evaluation is to choose a random
position (within its range) for each constraint, the size of this
task is affected only by the number of constraints, not by the
amount of overlap. Looking in from outside, we can compute
which rankings could result and what the individual likelihood
is of each, but this has no effect on the actual process of fixing a
ranking.

and 3), and predict 23% non-3sg forms and observe 15%
(Tables 2 and 3).4
Compare stage 4b to stage 3b with respect to the realization of tense. Notice that, while at stage 3b, 100% of the
finite utterances were tensed, at stage 4b only 60% (6 out of
10) of the finite forms are tensed. In other words, we predict
(and in fact observe) a “dip” in the child’s production of
tensed forms. If children were simply “learning tense”
(speaking vaguely), we would not have expected them to get
worse at any point during the course of development. The
proposed analysis provides an explanation for this otherwise
puzzling fact. Back in stage 3b, PARSEA was ranked so low
as to ensure that tense features were realized in the single
functional projection allowed. What has happened at stage
4b is that the tense features and agreement features now
compete for realization in the single functional projection
available. Since tense sometimes (in fact, half the time)
loses to agreement, we predict the observed dip in the proportion of tensed forms, which coincides with an increase in
the proportion of agreeing forms.
In the last stage covered in our data, stage 4c (Figure 7
above), PARSET and PARSEA together move to a position
high enough in the hierarchy that they invariably outrank
*F2. This yields 2 rankings, but both produce the same optimal candidate, a finite form which realizes both Tense and
Agreement. At this stage, we predict no NRFs, and we observed only 2% NRFs in child speech (Table 4). We also
expect the children’s production of non-present forms and
non-3sg forms to match the proportion in adult speech,
which it does quite well; we observed (Tables 1–3) 31%
non-present tense forms compared with 31% for adults, and
36% non-3sg forms compared with 38% for adults.
Figures 8–9 (next page) summarize graphically how the
predictions of the model match the observed child data.

Concluding Remarks
To sum up, our research has uncovered previously overlooked properties of the acquisition of tense and agreement.
We found that tense and agreement in French follow distinct
courses of acquisition over the three stages studied. While
the use of tense starts and ends strong, it suffers a “dip” at
the intermediate stage. Meanwhile, agreement develops in a
more linear way while the proportion of NRFs drops, also
linearly. The distinctive profile naturally leads to an analysis
in which, at the intermediary stage, tense and agreement are
competing for realization. In particular, an OptimalityTheoretic analysis making use of “floating constraints” (defining partial ranking orders) allow us to predict not only the
occurrence of the observed types of utterances, but their frequency as well. This result is novel; previous analyses (e.g.
__________
4
The predictions here are again scaled by the “expected” proportion of non-present forms and non-3sg forms based on what
we found in the observed adult speech (Table 3). 60% of forms
are predicted to be tensed by our analysis, and adults produce
31% non-present forms, so we expect to find 60%×31% = 19%
of (finite) child utterances to be in a non-present form. Similarly, since adults produce 38% non-3sg forms, we expect t o
find 60%×38% = 23% non-3sg forms in the children’s (finite)
utterances.

Ferdinand, 1996; Pierce, 1992; Wexler 1994, 1998) have
provided no clear way even to describe the facts about the
changing frequencies of tense and agreement realizations over
the course of acquisition. Under our proposal, the frequency
predictions are a natural consequence of the re-ranking
mechanism. The fundamental principle of OT, that grammars share the same constraints but rank them differently
with respect to one another, requires that the acquisition
process be one of re-ranking constraints. We have proposed
that this re-ranking occurs not in sudden jumps but by
spreading constraints across ranges in the rankings, narrowing in on the correct adult ranking. These “floating” or partially ranked constraints allow our model to make frequency
predictions that seem to be borne out in child French.
