     With the work of implementing predation in these
particular computational media well underway, several
phenomena are worth noticing. First, Lisa has been
adjusting model parameters without understanding how the
predation function works. When she asks “you guys”
(Manuel and Ned) for an explanation, Manuel describes
what the node does from the perspective of Guppies: it is a
type of death caused by Caribou/Wolf Fish.
     Second, as Lisa looks inside this function and questions
how many Guppies are eaten by Caribou/Wolf Fish (turn
11), Manuel proposes and Lisa executes a change in how the
predation node is defined. Manuel’s proposal unpacks the
monthly value into a daily rate of consumption (i.e., 3 per
day, times 30 days in a month, gives 90 guppies per
Caribou/Wolf Fish per month).                                      Figure 2. MLKN’s network model of predation and a graph
