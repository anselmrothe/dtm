thoroughly reviewed [Evans, 1992c]. The most common of
these are headaches, dizziness, blurred vision (or other visual
disturbances), memory impairment, attention/concentration
difficulties, increased reaction and information processing
times, and personality changes including increased
irritability, anxiety and depression.
Ford and Khalil [1996a,b] have developed an objective
scoring system for AEP, VEP and EEG findings from patients
with suspected mTBI. In these studies, significant group
differences were found between patients and controls, a
relatively objective scoring system was developed, and the
patterns were used to identify about 60% of the patients, with
no false positives. The following analysis is limited to the
auditory P300 response.
The auditory P300 component is one of the most
investigated of all the cognition-driven evoked responses. It
is a prominent, posterior vertex positive component, peaking
at approximately 300-350 ms post-stimulus in response to
randomly presented "oddball" stimuli that are counted or
otherwise identified by the subject.
The generator sources of the auditory P300 component
have been suggested in the hippocampus [Halgren et al., 1980;
Wood et al, 1984; Neshige & Luders, 1992] and, possibly,
with neocortical localization with deep frontal and thalamic
contributions [Yingling & Hosobuchi, 1984; Wood et al.,
1984; Neshige & Luders, 1992]. Recent work [Pilgreen,
1995; Gevins & Cutillo, 1995] expand on these earlier
studies.
In this study we compared the auditory P300 responses of
two groups - a patient group identified by the scoring system
referred to above with a normal group of age and gender
matched controls. The comparison was performed as
follows: the potential field for each subject was approximated
at the cortical surface using the cortical imaging technique
[Sidman, 1991] for a 50 msec epoch extending from 25 msec
prior to the latency of the maximum voltage at Pz (the P300
latency) to 25 msec after the maximum. The average normal
response and the average abnormal response on the cortical

An objective scoring system has been developed to quantify degrees
of auditory evoked potential (AEP) abnormalities in patients suffering
from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this study the AEP P300
responses for 20 patients with scores in the abnormal range were
compared to the responses in 20 age and gender equivalent controls.
The cortical imaging technique (CIT) was used to calculate the
evolution of potential changes on the surface of the brain during a 50millisecond epoch containing the AEP P300 response for both groups
of subjects. AEP P300 condition recordings were obtained from 20
EEG and 2 EOG artifact channels. Previously published CIT results
showed anterior and posterior peaks, implying multiple sources, for the
P300 component. This study suggests that the anterior sources are
significantly attenuated in the patient group and this anterior P300
attenuation appeared relatively more focal than that seen with scalp
topographical maps alone and that the effects of the injury appear to
be selective at the anterior sites.

Introduction
This study compares the auditory P300 evoked responses of
a group of subjects who have suffered mild traumatic brain
injuries (mTBI), with those of a group of age and gender
matched normal controls. Analyses were conducted using
the cortical imaging technique (CIT), a mathematical
procedure for constructing activity as it theoretically would
appear on the cortical surface. The goal is to detect subtle
differences in the evoked response that are not apparent from
the scalp recordings, and may suggest the intracerebral site of
injury.
A growing body of radiological, neuropsychological,
electrophysiological, neuropathological and experimental
evidence indicates that mild brain injury may occur in the
absence of direct impact to the head, and in cases where there
is no loss of consciousness [Binder, 1986; Evans, 1992a,b].
MRI, CT, routine EEG and conventional evoked potential
(EP) recordings are often unremarkable in these cases, yet
the patients may have sequelae that affect professional
functioning and activities of daily living for months or years.
Sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been

Sidman & Ramsey, 1993].

as identified by a distinct voltage maximum primarily at Pz.
The standard deviation of the latencies was 25 ms. In each
case scalp (Figure 1) and cortical surface (Figure 2)
potential maps were constructed for the epoch extending
from 25 ms (one standard deviation) prior to the latency of
the peak to 25 ms after the peak. The time point t0 is the
latency of the AEP P300 , different for each individual, and
pairs of consecutive time points are 3.125 ms apart. The
evoked responses were aligned at time point t0 for each group
of subjects to obtain the average normal response and average
patient response for 50 ms (see [Ford, Sidman & Ramsey,
1993]), on the scalp (Figure 1) and cortical surface (Figure
2). The SURFER® software was used throughout for making
the graphical displays. The right-most column of pictures
for each figure compares the two sequences of pictures by
plotting the t-scores (degrees of freedom = 37) at each of the
20 scalp sites, for Figure 1, and for 160 cortical surface
sites, for Figure 2.
Ford et al.,1993 [Ford, Sidman & Ramsey, 1993], contains
a similar analysis for the entire ~250 ms epoch containing
the N2a/P300/N3 complex of responses for normal subjects.
T-score differences between groups show significant
attenuation in the patient group at time points leading into and
including the P300 component peak, but not afterward. The
differences were significant at the anterior source only.

Mathematical Analysis-The Cortical Imaging
Technique (CIT)
The mathematical method that was used to perform the
analyses reported here is the cortical imaging technique
[Sidman, 1991]. Briefly, this method is a way of simulating
the potential field on the cortical surface, presumably closer
to the actual generators of the scalp-recorded field.

Subjects and Measuring Procedure
Twenty normal subjects and twenty mTBI patients (as
identified in [Ford and Khalil, 1996a]) were included in this
study. Twenty channels of EEG and two channels of EOG
activity were recorded with a NeuroScience Brain Imager,
Series III (for amplification and on-line filtering) and a
NeuroScan, Inc. software based system using two Dell 433/L
PCs (for stimulus presentation, A-to-D conversion, data
recording and off-line baseline correction, filtering, artifact
minimization, averaging and group statistics).
Electrode sites were the twenty standard International 1020 system placements (FP1/2, F3/4, F7/8, T3/4, C3/4, T5/6,
P3/4, O1/2, Fz, Cz, Pz and Oz), with a linked ear reference.
Vertical and horizontal eyeball and eyelid movements (VEOG
and HEOG) were also recorded for possible artifact
rejection. The recording protocol for all subjects included
both resting and P300 auditory.
In the AEP P300 recording, 165 total responses were
recorded to the frequent tone (1kHz, 95dB, 50ms duration,
binaural) and to the "oddball" or rare tone (2kHz, 95dB, 50ms
duration, binaural). There was a variable inter stimulus
interval of 1.9-2.1 secs. The probability of an "oddball" or
rare tone occurrence was 20%, and the same sequence of
frequent and rare stimuli was presented to all subjects. The
subjects were instructed to count the rare tone silently to
themselves, and their answers were recorded at the end of the
session.
The low pass filter was set at 100Hz, high pass filter set at
1.05Hz, with the 60Hz notch filter activated. Sweeps were
automatically rejected for artifact if the voltage in either
VEOG or HEOG channels exceeded +100 µv. Analog to
digital processing was performed at 320 Hz yielding 256
points and an EP epoch from -100ms to 700ms (3.125ms
resolution) for all EP recordings.

Conclusions
Scalp topography of the auditory P300 component typically
shows the peak amplitude at posterior vertex area sites, with
no strong indication of more than one generator site. In
previous studies with CIT, using 28 channel data [Ford,
Sidman & Ramsey, 1993], we have demonstrated that there
are several apparent sources in normals, including an anterior
one and symmetric, bilaterally homologous, centro-parietal
sources. In another previous study, we found that individuals
with histories and symptoms consistent with mild TBI showed
attenuation of the scalp-recorded auditory (and visual) P300
component, with significant differences spread widely across
all anterior sites. The primary purpose of the present study
was to analyze the P300 recordings from the mild TBI cases
using CIT to determine whether CIT was more sensitive in
identifying group differences.
The results of the P300 scalp recordings from both groups
showed the expected P300 peak in the area of Pz, with no
anterior source indicated. Statistical differences between
groups were negligible. CIT analyses of the recordings in
both groups showed two clear sources - including one from
Fz and the surrounding area. When compared statistically, the
differences between groups were significant at the anterior but not posterior -source. These results indicate that
whatever injury is present in these cases differentially affects
the anterior source contributing to the generation of the P300
component, while the posterior source remains unaffected.

Results
All of the mTBI patients (20) and all but one of the normal
controls (19) exhibited a well defined AEP P300 component,

Although it is not possible to determine the exact
mechanism nor locus of injury, based upon the analysis of
20-channel scalp-recorded EP data, the results are not
inconsistent with other reports of abnormal findings involving
anterior or subcortical regions. (Parenthetically, the
availability of 128- and 256-channel recordings may make
the elucidation of the mechanism involved possible.) The
purpose of the study was to determine whether CIT analyses
provided additional information beyond that obtained from
scalp recordings, and the results suggest a focal effect at the
anterior midline area, thus suggesting subcortical
involvement, since the differences from adjacent areas over
frontal cortex were not significant.
In summary, the P300 has been shown to have significant
amplitude attenuation and/or latency increases in association
with a host of clinical disorders and conditions, including
schizophrenia, dementia, alcoholism, brain injury, and some
instances of learning disability, to name a few. The typical
scalp recorded P300 waveform shows amplitude attenuation
and/or latency increases across diagnostic groupings, and is
thus concluded to be a nonspecific indicator of dysfunction.
However, further analyses using analytical techniques such as
CIT may ultimately show differential effects on the generator
sources for the P300 component among groups, thereby
yielding information that is valuable in understanding the
underlying processes involved.
