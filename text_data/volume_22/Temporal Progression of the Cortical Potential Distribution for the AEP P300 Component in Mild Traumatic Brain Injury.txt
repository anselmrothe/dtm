Figure 1 - 1a) Scalp-recorded voltages for the average normal subject at latencies ranging from 25 ms. prior to P300 to 25
  ms. after P300. Values are in microvolts. 1b) Scalp-recorded voltages for the average mTBI subject at the same relative
  latencies as in 1a). 1c) t-score comparison of the scalp contour plots in 1a) and 1b). Regions where the scalp-recorded
  voltages for the average patient are significantly attenuated (p < .02) in comparison with the average normal subject are
  highlighted with bold contours. These pictures each represent an overhead view of the scalp, modeled as a sphere of radius
  1.0, in which the top- center is the nasion.
Figure 2 - 2a) Voltages on the cortical surface (as computed by CIT) for the average normal subject at latencies ranging from
  25 ms prior to P300 to 25 ms after P300. Values are in microvolts. 2b) Voltages on the cortical surface for the average
  mTBI subject at the same relative latencies as in 2a). 2c) t-score comparisons of the cortical surface contour plots in 2a)
  and 2b). Regions where the cortical surface voltages for the average patient are significantly attenuated (p < .02) in
  comparison with the average normal subject are highlighted with bold contours. These pictures each represent an overhead
  view of the cortical surface, modeled as a sphere of radius 0.6, in which the top-center lies under the nasion.
