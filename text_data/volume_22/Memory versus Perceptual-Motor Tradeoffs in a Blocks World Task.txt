                        Experiment
The blocks world task is based on the paradigm used by
Ballard et al., (1995). The task is to copy a pattern of
colored blocks shown in the target window to the
workspace window, using the colored blocks in the resource
window (for our version see Figure 1).
   To do the task, participants have to remember three pieces
of information: (a) the color of the block to be copied, (b)
the position of the block to be copied, and (c) which blocks
have or have not been copied. The first two pieces have to
be obtained from the target window whereas the third piece
has to be obtained by comparing the target window with the
workspace window.                                               Figure 1. The blocks world task. In the actual task all
