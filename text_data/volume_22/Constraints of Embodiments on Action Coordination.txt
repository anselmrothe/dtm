assume the opposite role (the compensator becomes the an-                 100

pensator).
   Hence, the prediction for individuals is that they will pick
similiar turn-around points at both borders. Therefore, the  Distance in pixels

absolute difference between the left and the right turn-around
point in a trial should be relatively small and not change
substantially across consecutive blocks. In contrast, two
persons in a group should pick more heterogeneous turn-
around points initially. However, in later trials they may                 50
coordinate their actions by „agreeing“ on a certain turn-
around point. Therefore, we predict a huge initial difference
that substantially decreases in later blocks.
