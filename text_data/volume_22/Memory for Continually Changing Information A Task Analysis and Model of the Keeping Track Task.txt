predictions deviate most highly from the data. A replica-
tion would be necessary to find out if this deviation is
rather due to noise in the data or to inappropriate as-
sumptions of the model. In such a study, the probability
distribution of the one-object/same-attribute condition
should be approximated to the distributions of the other
conditions in order to draw clearer conclusions about
information organization.
                        Conclusions
   The model has demonstrated clearly that a task analy-
sis combined with a small set of assumptions about the
dynamics of memory traces is sufficient to reproduce the
basic results related to the keeping track paradigm. No
distinction between memory capacities for static and for
dynamic information is needed. The model implies that
interference occurs between representations of current
values. Hence, an issue of future research should be to
investigate what happens with the representations of out-
dated values. As to the factor information organization, it
has been shown that the effect of this factor is partially
due to the deviating probability structure of one of the
conditions. To clarify the influence of information or-
ganization, the probability structures should be assimi-
