                          Introduction
Mathematical notation and natural language share many com-
mon features. Both have a well-defined syntax and seman-
tics, and both allow for the expression of abstract information.
However, an important difference is that the layout of math-
ematical notation is two dimensional in nature, with equa-
tions relying on both vertical and horizontal adjacency rela-
tionships between the symbols to provide the meaning. It is
natural then to ask how humans comprehend mathematical
expressions.
   The present paper extends our understanding of how hu-
mans perceive mathematical expressions in two ways. First
we explore the nature of the internal representation used to
encode equations. Specifically, we examine whether the in-
formation recovered from equations has a parse tree structure
similar to that used to represent sentences of natural language.
