Three groups of current submarine officers participated in
the study: Junior Officers (JOs), Department Heads (DHs),
and Commanding Officers or Executive Officers
(CO/XOs). The average number of years spent at sea,
years in the navy, and ages can be found in Table 1. The
expert participants in this study had slightly less
experience than those in phase 1. This was most likely
because, unlike the phase 1 AOs, all were active duty and
none were post-command. (The phase 1 COs had a mean                  Figure 3: The Ned Target Motion Analysis screen without
