   Explanation          The Satellite, which is typically independent of the will of an animate object, explains the Nucleus.
   Cause                The situation in the Satellite causes the situation in the Nucleus.
   Interpretation       The situation presented in the Satellite interprets (presents a different perspective on) the Nucleus and
                        constitutes the opinion of the writer of the situation in the Satellite.
   Means                The Satellite explains the means by which the Nucleus was done.

   We will illustrate the main criteria which determine
whether a PP should be treated as a discourse unit or not by
contrasting the sample sentences (1-a) and (1-b). In Sentence
(1-a), the PP specifies an instrument for attracting new cus-
tomers. As it seems entirely reasonable to consider “instru-
ment” as a typical property of “attraction” events, this exam-
ple should straightforwardly be dealt with by standard seman-
tic interpretation — the conceptual correlate of P6LXZ-A will
