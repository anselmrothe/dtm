   Subject instructions in the verbal condition emphasized
egocentric calibration. Quoting from the instructions that
were read to each subject, “In this condition you will be
telling the experimenter where you think the target is in
relation to straight ahead.” Further, “If the target looks like
it’s directly in front of you, you will indicate this by saying
‘center’.” Thus center was defined in terms of the subject’s
body rather than the apparatus or the frame.
   Sensorimotor measure: the subject rested the right
forefinger on a foam pad mounted on the centerline of the
apparatus just in front of the chin rest, then jabbed the target
with the forefinger as soon as the target disappeared. Thus
both cognitive and sensorimotor measures were open-loop,
without error feedback. Before the experimental trials began,
subjects practiced jabbing the target -- some were reluctant
to respond vigorously at first for fear of damaging the
apparatus. Subjects then received at least 10 practice trials in
the jab condition and 10 the verbal condition.
   Trial Execution: A computer program randomly selected
target and frame positions, with the exception that an
identical set of positions could not occur on two successive
trials. For verbal trials, the experimenter recorded the
subject’s response by typing a number (1-5) on the
computer’s keyboard corresponding to the subject’s verbal
estimate. The computer recorded motor responses
automatically.
   In each trial one of the two target positions and one of the
three frame positions was presented, exposed for one
second, and extinguished. Since the projected frame
provided all of the illumination, target and frame exposure
were simultaneous. A computer-generated tone told the
subject to respond. For no-delay trials the tone sounded as
the shutter extinguished the frame, while on other trials the
tone began after a 1-sec or 2-sec delay. During the delay the
subject sat in darkness.

effect. These experiments show that oculomotor fixation and
spatially selective attention are not responsible for accurate
pointing behavior in an illusory visual context.
                        Conclusions
     Once again, the evidence can be interpreted in terms of
two visual systems, one based on egocentric coordinates to
govern motor behavior and another that uses information
from visual context to represent spatial relationships in
perception. Also, these experiments lend support to the
claim that the price in performance the cognitive system
must pay in order to take advantage of visual context
information is a susceptibility to illusions of spatial context.
While it has been shown that direct fixation driven by
attentional selection is not the mechanism responsible for
accurate pointing behavior in a visual context that creates
illusory perceptions in the cognitive system, this shows only
that fixation is not responsible. Other aspects of attention
may be responsible for the continued accuracy of motor
behavior in these experiments.
     The visual mechanism by which motor behavior is
governed has been shown to be extremely robust, both by
these and previous studies. Indeed, the reappearance of a
Roelofs effect for motor responses after a delay (Bridgeman
et. al., 1997) shows that the cognitive system can provide
information to the motor system when necessary, and this so
far appears to be the only form of communication between
the two systems. To date there is no evidence that the
cognitive system can access spatial location information in
the motor system, supporting the inference that spatial
information can flow in only one direction, from cognitive to
motor. In normal visual conditions, however (motor
interactions with still-visible targets), spatial information in
the two systems remains segregated.
