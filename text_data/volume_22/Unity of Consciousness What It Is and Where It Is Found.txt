  A full set of relevant distinctions here would distinguish among
consciousness of self, consciousness of one’s psychological states,
one’s conscious states themselves, and so on. We do not need to go
into the differences among these things here. For purposes of
understanding the unity of consciousness, it is enough to
distinguish between consciousness of self, on the one hand, and
simple consciousness of the “world”, on the other.
