   Point-light displays were first used to study adults' event
perception and biomechanical motion by attaching small
lights to the head and main joints of an individual’s body
and filming the person performing different actions against
a dark background (Johansson, 1973). Because point-light
displays are deprived of detailed contextual information
such as the agent and location of an event, the information
about an action given in such displays is expressed in the
overall shapes of the light sequences. Previous studies
