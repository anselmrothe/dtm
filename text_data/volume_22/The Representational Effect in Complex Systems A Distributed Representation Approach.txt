                       Conclusion
The experimental results were generally consistent with the
predictions of the distributed representation analysis. The
prediction was that the instrument with more external
information would be easier. This prediction was supported
by     the    observed      representational    effect.   The
representational effect predicted that isomorphic
representations could produce different behaviors due to the
variant    distributions     of    internal   and    external
representational information.
     The resulting behavior variance from the experiment
indicates that some representations are more ‘efficient’ in
extending the necessary information for a task. Although
the different isomorphic representations result in different
initial levels of performance and learning curves,
performances appear to converge after a sufficient period of
learning.
     One argument can be made about the learning
behavior: learning and practice may eliminate the
representational effect after enough trials. However, further
research needs to be done in more complex and dynamic
settings. The current experimental task was a simple
position-fixing task in a very controlled and static
environment. In an unpredictable and complex
environment such as that of the cockpit of an aircraft, the
representational effect could be more pronounced and a
possible regression to initial performance levels should be
studied. Another issue that is worth of further study is
whether the converged performance after learning for
different representations will diverge again under extreme
conditions such as high cognitive workload and time
pressure.
