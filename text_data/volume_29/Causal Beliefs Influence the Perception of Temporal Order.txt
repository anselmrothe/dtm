   Participants were instructed to highlight the arrows by
clicking on them to indicate how they thought the sliders
were connected. When clicked, the arrows changed from grey
to red. When the participant had chosen all of the arrows he
or she wished and clicked the ‘finished’ button, text appeared
on the screen indicating whether the model was right or
wrong. If the participant’s choice was incorrect, he or she
was returned to the intervention task to try again. This process
iterated until the participant chose the correct model. Once
this occurred another set of directions appeared:
