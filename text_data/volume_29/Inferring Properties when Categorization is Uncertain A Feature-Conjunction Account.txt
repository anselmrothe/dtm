problem can be construed as one of making a property
inference based on a category (the party affiliation of the
next President) whose identity is uncertain. Most previous
work on property inference has focused on predictions about
the attributes of members of known categories (see Heit,
2000 for a review). Given the often unpredictable nature of
the environment, however, it is inevitable that people will
also make inferences about objects whose category
membership has yet to be determined.
   One approach to this problem, derived from Bayesian
calculus and suggested in the earlier example, is to identify
the possible categories to which an object might belong,
derive the probabilities of the predicted property for each
category, and then combine these conditional probabilities,

that people use this strategy (cf. Malt, et al., 1995; Murphy
& Ross, 1994, 2005), to be confident in our conclusions
about feature conjunction it was important to remove this
confound. This was the main aim of Experiment 2.
                       Experiment 2
Experiment 2, therefore, set up a direct comparison of
feature conjunction and Bayesian multiple-category
reasoning. The experimental design was similar to
Experiment 1 except that stimuli were constructed to
contrast predictions based on these two strategies, while
controlling for other possible strategies (e.g., single-
category reasoning). The formal probability predictions
derived from these strategies are summarized in Table 1.             Figure 2: Example of a geometric shape/color set used in
