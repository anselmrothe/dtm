Indicators of Informational Uncertainty
   What indicators were commonly used in each of the two
domains? Figure 1 shows that: 1) all strategies were used in
both domains, 2) No Pattern is rarely used to identify
significant moments of uncertainty, and 3) that the two
contexts had considerable variability in strategy use,
X2(2)=8.84, p<.02. In the highly novel situation with a slow
data acquisition rate, ambiguity of information was the most
common source. In the more common situation with high
data acquisition from multiple sources, inconsistent
information was the most common source.

there was relatively more use of examining additional data,
adjusting for known deviations, using mental spatial
transformations, and focusing on the reliability of sources.
By contrast, in MER, there was relatively more use of
domain knowledge and planning. While the differences

understandable in terms of the nature of the two domains. In
METOC, many different data sources for a given problem
exist (e.g., different weather models, close time points,
related dimensions), making for easy examination of
additional data and allowing for the heuristic of using
reliability of different sources. In MER, data trickles in at a
slower rate, and thus working from first-principles domain
knowledge and planning additional data collection are more
relevant operators for resolving informational uncertainty.
