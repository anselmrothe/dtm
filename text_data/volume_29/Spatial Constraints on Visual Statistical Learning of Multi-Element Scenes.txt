Although the results of Experiment 1 are highly suggestive,
one possible limitation is that participants received the
identical test in both test phases. It is possible that the first
test biased participants’ performance on the second test.
Thus, to eliminate this potential confound, we conducted
Experiment 2 which incorporated only one test phase.
Additionally, in order to encourage participants to better
attend to the scenes in the exposure phase, we used a same-
different task (Conway & Christiansen, 2005), rather than
passive exposure.
