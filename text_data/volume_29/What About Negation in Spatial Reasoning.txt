Abstract
How do we reason about spatial descriptions? In recent years
a lot of research has been investigated in order to determine
factors of complexity in spatial relational reasoning. Several
factors like the number of models, the wording of conclusion
or relational complexity have been determined. Any of these
factors effected reasoning. But the literature focused solemnly
on positive premises. Negated expressions like “The fork is
not to the right of the cup” had not been investigated. Since in
everyday spatial reasoning the role of negation is eminent, we
study negated spatial relations from a formal and
psychological perspective. Central questions are: How are
negated statements represented? If there are various models
consistent with the set of premises, which of these is
constructed initially? Is there an effect for different reference
frames? We conducted three experiments for investigating
these research questions. We will show that humans (i) negate
a relation by using the opposite relation, (ii) use a cognitive
economic principle in constructing mental models, (iii)
construct preferred mental models, and (iv) have more
difficulties in reasoning with negated relations in comparison
to indeterminate positive descriptions.
Keywords: Spatial Reasoning; Cognitive Modeling;
Spatial Representation.

Introduction
There is a great body of evidence supporting the mental
model theory of spatial reasoning. The key idea of this
theory is that reasoners translate the spatial relations in the
real or imagined world into a mental model and use this
representation to solve given spatial inference problems. To
provide an example (cf. Mani & Johnson-Laird 1982):
(I) The plate is to the left of the knife.
The fork is to the left of the knife.
The glass is in front of the knife.
The spoon is in front of the plate.
This describes the following two possible models:
fork

spoon
plate

glass
knife

spoon
plate

fork

glass
knife

Assume a child helps his mother to set the table. The child
takes the knife and puts it to the left of the plate. But the
mother says to the child “The knife does not belong to the
left of the plate”. Where will the child place the knife?
Logically, there are three possibilities: the knife can be
placed to the right of, in front of, or behind the plate (not
considering that the knife can be placed above or under the
plate). After a certain time the child will know how the
single components should be placed on the table. This is
what we call the background knowledge, but this goes
beyond the scope of the paper.
How are such problems with negation processed? Is there
a preferred interpretation? The mental model theory
(MMT), introduced by Johnson-Laird and Byrne (1991),
suggests that people draw conclusions by constructing and
inspecting a spatial array that represents the state of affairs
described in the premises. It is a three stage process
consisting of a comprehension, description, and validation
phase. In the comprehension phase, reasoners construct a
mental model that reflects the information from the
premises. If new information is encountered during the
reading of the premises it is immediately used in the
construction of the model. During the description phase,
this model is inspected to find new information that is not
explicitly given in the premises. Finally, in the validation
phase alternative models are searched that refute this
putative conclusion. However, some questions remain open
with regards to how people deal with multi-model problems.
For example, which model is constructed first, and does this
model construction adhere to certain principles? Why do
reasoners neglect some models?
All these questions are not answered by the classical
mental model theory. In contrast, the preferred mental
model theory (PMMT) has been developed to explain that
humans generally tend to construct a preferred mental
model (PMM). The PMM is the starting point for deriving
at a putative conclusion. In the model variation phase the
participants tend to make local and continuous
transformations starting from the PMM to search counterexamples (Rauh et al., 2005).
Several predictions of the PMMT about insertion
principles as well as transformation strategies in spatial

relational reasoning can be shown (Ragni et al., 2006).
Assume we have two premises of the form (1) “A is to the
left of B” and (2) “A is to the left of C”. Humans tend to
process these premises sequentially, i.e. first, a model A B is
generated and then object C is inserted into the model.
There are two possibilities where C can be inserted:
• In between A and B (first fit principle, ff-principle) or
• To the right of B (first free fit principle, fff-principle)
PMMs are constructed by using the fff-principle. This has
been empirically confirmed (Ragni et al., 2006).
But how do humans process a premise like “A is not to
the left of C”? Do they remain in one dimension (by using
the opposite relation only)? Which kind of insertion
principle is then used? Kaup and colleagues (2006) focused
on the negation in sentences and contradictory predicates.
They conducted a verification experiment in which
participants had to verify sentences (e.g. the door was not
open) and pictures of situations described in the sentences
(e.g. closed door, open door). Reaction times were shorter if
the sentence and the picture corresponded (affirmation).
Since there are only two states possible (the door is open or
the door is closed) there is only one opposite state left.
Multiple model cases have not been investigated.
Hasson and Glucksberg (2006) examined the difference in
understanding affirmative and negated assertions in natural
language. The participants had to make decisions on using
terms related to either the affirmative or the negative
meaning. The results suggest that the affirmative assertion
continued to facilitate affirmative-related terms, but the
negated assertion did not. In the literature, no work
regarding negation in multiple model cases has been
reported.
In this paper, we analyze spatial problems with negated
relations. The next section contains a formal analysis of
negated spatial problems. In the following, we present
empirical data in support of our theory. Finally, we discuss
the results presented in the paper and give a short overview
of some questions that are left open.

question depends on the used reference frame. Since we are
using spatial relations, our reference frame in this case is a
relational system consisting of already defined spatial
relations. We only take the most parsimonious set of
relations, i.e. the relations to the right of, to the left of, over
and under. More complex relations then can be defined by
using this set of relations and propositional connectives like
logical ‘and’ and logical ‘or’. Take for instance the ternary
relation “B is in between A and C”. This relation can be
purely represented on a two-dimensional grid by using the
four relations. Namely “B is in between A and C” is
equivalent to all models of “A is left of B & B is to the left
of C or A is to the right of B & B is to the right of C or A is
behind of B & B is behind of C or A is behind B & B is
behind of C”.
How can we define, based on the reference frame and the
parsimonious relations, right, left, over, and under the
negation of a relation? In our setting the following statement
is always true: “A is left of B or A is to the right of B or A
is over of B or A is under B”, since there are no other
possibilities (of course this could be easily extended to
three-dimensions). If we receive a premise like “A is not to
the left of B”, then it follows logically that the rest of the
sentence holds, i.e. that “A is to the right of B or A is over
B or A is under B”. In several experiments the existence of
preferred models has been confirmed (Rauh et al., 2005;
Ragni et al., 2006). Compare the following two sets of
premises
(II) A is to the left of B.
C is to the right of A.

(III) A is to the left of B.
C is not to the left of A.

Mathematical Background

If we assume that participants interpret the relation “not” as
the opposite relation, then the premise sets II and III have
identical models. Therefore, both kinds of problems lead to
multiple model cases. There are several options to represent
negation:
• Reasoners could insert object A in an arbitrary
position to B (arbitrary interpretation).
• Reasoners could insert object A to the right of B
with/without annotating other possibilities for A
(opposite [annotated] interpretation).
• Reasoners could insert object A to the left
of B and annotating the violence on A
(violating interpretation).

Johnson-Laird (2001) introduced the principle of truth:
“A mental model can represent by default only what is true,
but not what is false” (p. 434). The same property holds for
mathematical models. It might be worth to analyze the
formal structure of the problem: The processing of a
premise is a function mapping of a linguistic statement
consisting of a propositional statement like “A is to the left
of B” to a position in a spatial array. This function is called
an interpretation (Ebbinghaus, Flum, & Thomas, 1994).
Mathematically it can be described as:

Other interpretations are possible as well but these are the
most reasonable. In the next section we provide data
supporting the preferred annotated interpretation.

Empirical Data

I: Premise → Spatial Array

We report three experiments on how humans generate and
inspect mental models out of given premises when a relation
of a premise is negated.
First, we questioned which relations between two objects
were accepted if a relation was negated or not? Second, we
were interested in the generation process of mental models:
(i) How is a object inserted into a model if the relation of

For the example introduced above “A is to the left of B”,
an interpretation maps Object A to position (0,0) and object
B to position (1,0) in a spatial array. But how is a negated
statement “A is not left of B” interpreted? Answering this

1410

the object is negated? (ii) Do participants use certain
insertion principles if a model contains a negated relation in
a given premise which leads to a preferred mental model
during the construction process? (iii) Are the preferred
mental models with negated problems different from
indeterminate positive problems? Finally, we examined the
constructed model during the inspection phase that
participants had in mind: (i) Which influences have different
construction directions, for example, if a model was built
from left to right or from right to left, and different term
arrangements in two-dimensional models? (ii) Are there
differences between indeterminate and negated problems
during the inspection phase?
We assumed that the participants interpret the negation of
the relation as the logical negation in the same dimension.
According to this hypothesis, we expected for the premise
“A is not to the left of B” that the participants construct a
model in which “A is to the right of B”. Another assumption
was that models with negated relations are harder to obtain
than models without negation. A further assumption was
that the complexity of the model that participants have in
mind is higher if a relation is negated in comparison to an
indeterminate relation.

The letter A had a fixed position in the center while the
letter B was randomly swapped through all other 48 free
cells in the grid. Every possible constellation of A and B
was presented with a statement (“B is not over A”, “B is not
right of A”). We also asked for “B is over A”, and “B is
right of A” in order to compare the data with positive cases.
The last two statements were tested on 16 of the 48 possible
cases (see Figure 2II). Response times and accuracy were
recorded for each statement.
Results. The participants made a clear decision for
affirmative (right/over) and negated (not right/not over)
statements. Figure 2 indicates that the distinction whether or
not B is over/not over A is clear. In both cases (with or
without underlying grid) the results are similar for all four
statements (over/not over and right/not right).

First Experiment - Acceptance
In this experiment the participants had to accept or reject
statements about positive or negated relations between two
objects. In the first part of the experiment we tested the
acceptance with an underlying grid, since the SRM use
distinct positions in a grid for solid objects without
overlapping. During the second part of the experiment we
tested without an underlying grid as the grid could bias the
acceptance due to a clear horizontal and vertical
arrangement which is not natural for a mental model.
Participants, Materials, Procedure and Design. Thirty-six
students of the University of Freiburg took part in this
experiment (with/without grid: n = 20/16, age in years: M =
24.3/24, SD = 2.4/2.8). The participants were presented with
pictures of two related objects and a statement. Figure 1
shows examples with (I) and without (II) an underlying grid.
Figure 2: I) Contains the negated statement “not
over”. The left square shows the overall decisions in
percent for NO and the right square for YES answers
(correct answers marked grey). The numbers below
contain the reaction times for the correct decisions. II)
Shows the affirmative statement “over” (all other
information is similar to I).

Figure 1: I) with underlying grid, II) without
underlying grid. Statement with negated relation of the
two objects that have to be accepted or rejected.

Reaction time for the negation problems with or without
underlying grid for “not over” is significantly longer than
for “not right” (with/without grid: t = 7.076/5.589, df =
19/15, p ≤ 0.01), as well as affirmative problems for “over”
in comparison to “right” (with/without grid: t =
3.326/4.062, df = 19/15, p ≤ 0.01).
In most cases the reaction time is significantly shorter
(see Fig. 3) if the statement and the actual state of the

1411

relation of A and B is true (with/without grid: “not over” t =
0.288/4.124, df = 19/15, p = n.s./p ≤ 0.01; “not right” t =
1.717/3.186, df = 19/15, p = n.s./p ≤ 0.05; “over” t =
2.810/3.550, df = 19/15, p ≤ 0.05/p ≤ 0.01; “right” t =
4.157/2.422, df = 19/15, p ≤ 0.001/p ≤ 0.05).

On the first page the participants were given the first two
premises, the following two premises were given on the
second page. The third page was empty and the participants
were asked to draw only one model even if multiple models
could be constructed. Additionally, the participants were
instructed not to use any kind of aid (no sketch, etc).

Second Experiment - Simple generating experiment
In this experiment, we investigated how people construct
a model if premises contain negated relations between two
objects. Additionally, we analyzed if participants construct a
preferred mental model (PMM). We assume an increase in
the difficulty for the generation of negated problems due to
the higher cognitive effort. Additionally, we test the
accuracy of the participants with determinate problems,
which serve as an exclusion criteria for the ability of the
participants to deal with the relational reasoning problems.
Participants, Materials, Procedure and Design. Twentythree students of the University of Freiburg took part in this
experiment (age in years: M = 25.81, SD = 4.45). It was
designed as a pen and paper experiment consisting of
sixteen problems (Table 1 and 2) in which the participant
had to construct a mental model out of four given premises.
This model should then be drawn on a sheet of paper. The
models were varied in the dimension (one- and twodimensional),
determination
(determinate
and
indeterminate) and negation (affirmative and negated).
Every model was presented twice but had different term
names (total of 16). All of the 16 problems were constructed
in the same way. Four premises arranged five different
objects with the relations left, right, over or under. The
relation of the third premise was always negated. Note that
models with negation were always indeterminate due to the
undetermined position of the object.
In order to guarantee that a model was constructed in
working memory only, each problem contained three pages.

(d) A is over B.
B is to the left of C.
I) D is not to the left of C.
II) D is to the right of C.
D is under E.

Results. The correct answers (see Tab. 3) indicate, that onedimensional problems are significantly more often correct
than two-dimensional problems (Wilcoxon-Test: Z = 3.109,
p = 0.002).

Table 5: Shows the material for the problems. The
cursive part indicates the three different types of the
models:
negated (3a), indeterminate (3b), and
determinate (3c). Half of the problems had the relation
”under” (I) in the fourth premise, the other “over” (II).
Every type of problem was presented twice.

Furthermore, there is a significant difference between
affirmative and negated problems (Wilcoxon-Test: Z =
2.618, p = 0.009). However, there is no significant
difference between determinate and indeterminate problems.
An additional question was how participants understand
negated problems. If one direction is negated, then all other
possible directions are allowed. There was a stable
preference for the opposite direction in negated problems.
Table 4 shows that except for indeterminate twodimensional problems the use of the opposite direction was
significantly more frequent. A further question was the
preference for a model. For both dimensions we found a
significant difference from zero for the PMM. When we
analyzed only the indeterminate problems for affirmative
versus negated problems, we did not find any significant
differences.
Table 4: Shows the preference for the opposite direction
in percent for one- and two-dimensional, as well as
determinate and indeterminate negated problems. The
numbers divided with colons denote the number of correct
answers for the opposite direction in comparison to all
correct answers. The last row indicates the proportion of
preferred models (fff) in comparison to the other principle
(ff). Note that the models for determinate negated problems
in this task do not provide the discrimination between
preferred and alternative models.

All four premises were given on the computer screen at
once. After pressing a key the premises disappeared and a
statement was presented. One object of the statement was
taken from the third premise and the other object from
another premise. This guaranteed that the participant had to
prove the model containing the negated relation and had to
infer an implicit relation between two objects. The relation
in the statement was always missing so that the participant
had to fill in the correct answer, or, in case of
indetermination, a relation that seemed the most possible.
There were four possible relations for an answer: left, right,
over and under.

Third Experiment - Model inspection and negation

Results. We found no differences in the overall premise
reading times between determinate, indeterminate, and
negated problems. The different term arrangements
(introduced through the fourth premise with “under” or
“over”) and dimension were not different likewise.
Again, we found a strong preference for PMM
(indeterminate/negated: alternative mental model, AMM =
24%; PMM = 76%; Binomial-Test p ≤ 0.001). The accuracy
of the answers decreases significantly from determinate to
indeterminate to negated problems (Page-L Test N = 14, k =
3, L = 178, p ≤ 0.05).

In the last experiment we analyze the inspection phase for
indeterminate and negated problems. We assume that if
participants were asked to inspect and validate recently
constructed mental models the difficulty for negated
problems increase due to the higher cognitive effort
(determinate < indeterminate < negated problems).
Participants, Materials, Procedure and Design. Sixteen
students of the University of Freiburg (age in years: M =
24.3, SD = 2.4) took part in this experiment. Two
participants were excluded due to the low accuracy rate (≤
50%) in determinate problems. We conducted a computer
experiment in order to measure reaction time and accuracy
as well as reading time for given premises. The experiment
contained 24 problems, 12 one-dimensional and 12 twodimensional (see Tab. 5).

General Discussion

1413

Without negated relations relational reasoning seems to be
inherently incomplete. But how do humans interpret and
reason with negated relations? A formal analysis showed
that there are at least three possible interpretations. First of
all, we are able to show that a negated expression like “A is
not to the left of B” is interpreted by the opposite relation
“to the right of”. Even, if the participants had the chance to
use correctly “over” or “under” they tend to maintain the
dimension (horizontal if the negated relation is horizontal

etc.). Especially the independence of interpreting relations
by using/not using a grid is remarkable. It is a justification
for using grid structures as a help in both designing
experiments
and
modeling
relational
reasoning
computationally (SRM, Ragni et al., 2005) by using a grid.
We found that the reaction time for the negation problems
with or without underlying grid for “not over” was
significantly longer than for “not right”. We assume that this
depends on the dimension the participants had to reason
about. It seems that it is more common for reasoners to
handle horizontal tasks. Finally, negation is a form of
reasoning with indeterminacy, but reasoning is more
complex and leads to more errors than reasoning with
determinate descriptions. The accuracy of the answers
decreased from indeterminate positive relations to negated
relations. Problems with negated premises offers a greater
variety of consistent models, but as well as in the classical
case (Ragni et al., 2006) humans tend to construct preferred
mental models to reduce complexity. Predictions about how
the negated relation is interpreted, as well as the
construction of a preferred mental model could be
confirmed by all experiments. In other words, there are
definitively preferred mental models in reasoning with
negated assertions, and in indeterminate cases the
participants constructed the preferred models by using the
fff-principle (Ragni, et al., 2006).
Some previous research has covered the linguistic
processing and comprehension. Kaup and colleagues (2006)
showed that the processing of matching sentences and
pictures are easier if the sentence and the picture
correspond. Hasson and Glucksberg (2005) examined the
question if negated information entails affirmation. They
were able to show that negated metaphors are most likely
represented as affirmation. However, in spatial reasoning
multiple model cases are possible. Therefore, the negation
of a spatial relation is not necessarily the opposite relation.
Additionally, the information about other possible models
has to be stored. In this case it seems reasonable to adapt an
approach of Vandierendonck, Dierckx, and De Vooght
(2004) for positive indeterminate model cases: to represent
the alternatives by annotations at the object that is related
with negation in the initial premises.
Our investigation can be contrasted to the work of Gapp
(1995) who investigated the question what kind of
configuration of two objects could still be described by a
relation. Participants had to rate configurations on a scale.
As a result he showed that participants accepted for instance
the relation “to the right of” in-between the angles ± 22.5°.
Contrary, we did not offer a continuous scale, because
humans have to build a mental model and therefore they use
a unique interpretation.
Negation plays an important role in representation and
reasoning. Since negation makes reasoning difficult, even
more than ambiguous descriptions, humans tend to construct
preferred mental models. Future work should cover aspects
of how participants find or neglect counter-examples and

how three-dimensional
processed.
