was that models with negated relations are harder to obtain
than models without negation. A further assumption was
that the complexity of the model that participants have in
mind is higher if a relation is negated in comparison to an
indeterminate relation.
First Experiment - Acceptance
   In this experiment the participants had to accept or reject
statements about positive or negated relations between two
objects. In the first part of the experiment we tested the
acceptance with an underlying grid, since the SRM use
distinct positions in a grid for solid objects without
overlapping. During the second part of the experiment we
tested without an underlying grid as the grid could bias the
acceptance due to a clear horizontal and vertical
arrangement which is not natural for a mental model.

students of the University of Freiburg took part in this
experiment (with/without grid: n = 20/16, age in years: M =

pictures of two related objects and a statement. Figure 1
