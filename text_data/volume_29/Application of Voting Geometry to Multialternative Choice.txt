researchers have moved from documenting anomalies to
attempting to model them.
    To date, the most successful attempt to model decision
anomalies has been Decision Field Theory (DFT),
introduced by Busemeyer and Townsend (1993). Using a
sequential sampling approach, DFT can account for three of
the most puzzling decision anomalies: compromise effects,
attraction effects, and similarity effects. Busemeyer and his
colleagues have proven that there exists no weighting
function for a utility model that can effectively capture all
three of these phenomena (Roe, Busemeyer, Townsend,
2001). While DFT remains the premier computational
approach for multi-attribute choice, recent criticism about
the biological plausibility of the model (Usher &
McClelland, 2004) has led researchers to try and account for
the "big three" decision anomalies using different                                          Figure 1: The choice set

Compromise effect: The compromise effect (Simonson,                  Procedure Lines
1989) occurs when a new option is introduced into a choice           With a choice set of three choices A, B, and C, there are six

Pr[A|{A, B, C}] and Pr[C|{A, B, C}] > Pr[B|{A, B, C}]
(Roe et a., 2001). Thus, the attractiveness of option C is
enhanced by the presence of A and B.
Similarity effect: The similarity effect, first noted by
Tversky (1972), occurs when a new option is introduced to a
choice set containing two dissimilar options. This new
option is very similar to one of the original options but
neither dominates it, nor is dominated by it. In the case of
the two options A and B in Figure 1, the similarity effect is
produced by the introduction of option S. Shoe S closely                     Figure 2: Geometrical representation of profiles

      Consider an example in which 1/2 of the voters prefer A >

   plurality vote assigns one point to the top-ranked choice,
   which is A in the first profile and B in the second and third
   profiles. C does not receive any points. The points are
   multiplied with the fraction of votes received by the choice

   vector: w P = ( 1 , 1 + 1 ,0) = ( 1 , 1 ,0) . The antiplurality is
