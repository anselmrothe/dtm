significant linear trend (F (1, 29) = 24.716, p < 0.05). Mean
accuracy averaged across all 4 runs for the RB group was
77.3% (SE = 0.034) and for the II group was 66.6% (SE =
0.055). The RB group accuracy was significantly greater
than the II accuracy across runs (F (1,29) = 12.5, p< 0.05).
The performance difference between groups was an
expected consequence of matching the discriminability of
the categories.
Modeling behavior
Out of 31 subjects, there were 120 useable blocks of data.
The RB model best accounted for 78/120 runs and the II
model for 42/120 runs. After sorting the model fits from
high to low by group, we selected only the top third from
both to be included in the resulting fMRI analyses. In some
cases, subjects contributed more than one run to the
analysis. The accuracy of the best RB-fit runs was 66.0%              Figure 3: RB vs. II, correct vs. incorrect trials in the (A)

driving the effect seen in the ROI. There were also several
areas that were more active for these RB-fit subjects when
they made an incorrect category judgment, particularly in

   The pattern of activity elicited by correct and incorrect
trials suggests that these trials are associated with different
cognitive operations. According to COVIS, the RB system
generates and selects amongst a variety of rules based on the
feedback after each trial. The feedback received during
incorrect trials should be an important indication of when
the decision boundary needs updating. The data here
