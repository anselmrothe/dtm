els of semantic structure, response time and decision-making
aid us in understanding and predicting user behavior. This of
course allows companies to provide better services, with less
unwanted intrusion on users. Importantly, however, when
basic science is applied to real world problems, it is not just
the applied domain that benefits. In the course of develop-
ing this approach, we observe evidence of the value of the
tune-in-and-out approach to understanding preferences, fast-
and-frugal models of decision-making, response-time mod-
eling, and the attempt to model semantic structure. In the
applied context, we observe a rapid turnover in the structure
of the environment, providing added weight to the `rational'
understanding of human forgetting. While none of these ap-
plications are definitive, it is extremely satisfying to see the
endeavors of cognitive modeling playing out successfully in
the real world.
