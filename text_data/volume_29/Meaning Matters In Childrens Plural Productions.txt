                       Experiment 1
The experimental task, borrowed from Johnston, Smith,
and Box (1997), elicits productions by asking children to
describe things to a blind-folded teddy bear. In the
present version, the child was presented on each trial with
an array of objects as illustrated in Figure 1. Each array
included two sets: a set of one (S Set) and a set of more
than one (P set). The child’s task was to tell the bear “to     (b)
get” one of the sets. On some trials, this was the S set and
so a likely word to indicate that set would be the singular
basic-level category term (e.g. “tree”). On the critical test
trials the target set was the P set, potentially generating a
plural noun (e.g. “pigs”). The size of the P set (two or
four) and the similarity of instances within the P set
(identical versus merely similar) was varied.
