that feeling. Intensity gives the agent an indication of how
important a feeling is, and thus helps determine to what extent
the feeling should influence behavior.
   Within this theory, two questions must be answered:
   1. How does the emotion appraisal frame combine with
        mood to produce the feeling appraisal frame?
   2. Given a feeling appraisal frame, how is the intensity of
        that feeling calculated?
   In the creation of the theory, we have tried to rely on
existing work and data. However, for the level of detail
required in a computational model, such prior work is limited.
Thus, we are faced with numerous decisions where there is
little or no guidance from the literature. In these cases, we
have tried to choose the simplest alternative (recognizing that
“simplest” can be a subjective concept); that is, we are
applying Occam’s Razor. Our long-term strategy is to see
where these simple assumptions fall short, which will indicate
where additional complexity is required. Thus, the theory we
present is likely oversimplified, but it provides a starting point
for future work.                                                           Figure 1: An emotion frame influences and combines with
