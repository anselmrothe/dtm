Abstract

can be affected by instructional design. This paper
investigates one instructional design feature: how the
ordering of examples affects construction of schemas and
categorization of problems.

We report an investigation of novices' ability to categorize
probability word problems. Individuals can effectively
learn from worked examples (Ward & Sweller, 1990),
especially if multiple examples with the same structural
features are presented (Gick & Holyoak, 1983). We were
interested in whether the order of worked examples could
affect a learner's ability to categorize new problems.
Participants studied 5 types of probability word problems;
each type had 2 worked examples. Two orders of worked
examples--blocked and random--were used. For isomorphic
test items, the random ordering reduced participants' total
number of categorization errors and their categorization
error rates. For transfer test items, ordering did not affect
categorization errors. We argue these results demonstrate
that the random ordering facilitated construction of
problem schemas, which subsequently improved
participant's categorization ability. However, the random
ordering appeared to have no effect on learners' ability to
restructure problem schemas as required by transfer items.

Instruction via examples
Worked examples, in which the solution steps for a
sample problem are written out for the learner, are
effective instructional aids. For novices in particular,
worked examples can be more instructive than solving
problems because they allow learners to devote mental
resources to building and refining their problem schemas
(Ward & Sweller, 1990). However, there is strong
empirical evidence that to successfully apply a problem
schema, more than one example with the same schema
must be studied. One hypothesized reason that multiple
examples of the same schema are necessary is that
multiple examples are needed in order for learners to
isolate the structural features of the examples
(Catrambone & Holyoak, 1989; Gick & Holyoak, 1983).
Word problems invariably have both surface features and
structural features. Surface features are aspects of the
cover story that are incidental; they are irrelevant and not
related to the problem schema in long-term memory. In
contrast, structural features form the basis for the problem
schema; structural features define and distinguish one
particular problem schema from another. Consider the
following probability word problem.

Introduction
Successful problem solving requires accurately
identifying the structure of the problem and constructing a
solution strategy based on this structure. Consider one
type of problem solving: word problems. To solve a word
problem an individual must construct a mental
representation of the problem and then search long-term
memory to find a similar problem representation. If this
recognition process is successful, the individual then has
access to an existing problem representation, a schema,
that can be used to guide his or her solution to the current
problem (Chi, Glaser, & Rees, 1982). Problem-solving
thus involves several cognitive processes: constructing a
mental representation of the problem, recognizing a
similar representation (i.e., a schema) in long-term
memory, activating that problem schema, mapping a
representation of the current problem to the existing
schema, and then using the schema to solve the problem.
In this paper we use the term categorization to refer to a
subset of these processes: constructing a problem
representation, recognizing a similar representation in
memory, and activating that schema. How learners build
problem schemas and complete the categorization process

Jonie is putting her groceries on the conveyer belt in the
supermarket. She has a potato, an onion, a tomato, a
squash, and broccoli in her basket. Assuming that she
randomly picks produce from the basket, what is the
probability that she will put the tomato on the conveyer belt
first and the squash on the belt second?

This problem has several surface features that are
incidental: groceries (as a set, and the individual grocery
items), picking items out of a container, and the values in
the problem (5 items total, 2 items being selected). On the
other hand, the problem has two crucial structural
features: one must consider the order in which items are
selected (i.e., permutation) and an item is not returned
after it has been selected (i.e., without replacement).
Research on problem solving has consistently shown
that novices have difficulty separating surface features
from structural features (Catrambone, 1998; Chang,
1019

Koedinger, & Lovett, 2003; Ross, 1989). One danger,
therefore, is that novices might construct an erroneous
schema by including surface features, rather than
structural features. A related danger is that novices might
construct a problem schema with incorrect structural
features. Consider a domain, such as probability, that has
multiple problem types, each with its own set of structural
features (see Table 1). Novices learning about this domain
would need to create multiple schemas, each with a
unique set of structural features. Given evidence that
novices should study multiple examples for a particular
problem type (Gick & Holyoak, 1983), learners would
need to study multiple examples for each of the different
problem types. They then have to apply this knowledge
by categorizing new problems on the basis of existing
schemas that they created while studying (Quilici &
Mayer, 1996). An important question for instructional
designers arises: can one order examples in a way that
maximizes a novice's ability to form multiple problem
schemas and categorize novel problems according to
these schemas?

that are structurally relevant (van MerriÃ«nboer,
Schuurman, de Crook, & Paas, 2002).
This paper investigates whether a blocked or random
order of worked examples facilitates a learner's ability to
build an accurate problem schema and to subsequently
categorize new problems. This research question is part of
a larger study investigating learning within the domain of
probability word problems (Gane & Catrambone, 2006).
To investigate how the order of worked examples affects
categorization, we created two sequences of worked
examples: blocked and random. Some of the worked
examples varied their structural features (i.e., five types of
probability word problems); all the worked examples
varied their surface features (i.e., 10 cover stories). If
consecutive examples of the same problem allow learners
to isolate surface features and build an accurate schema, a
blocked schedule should be better at helping a learner to
build an accurate schema. If, however, distributing
examples across learning forces learners to reconstruct
problem schemas or contrast different structural features,
a random schedule should be better.

Method

Block structural features
One approach to ordering worked examples is to block
multiple examples with the same structural features, so
that learners study consecutive examples from the same
problem category (see Table 1). This blocked ordering
might encourage learners to focus on structural features.
By changing the surface features but retaining structural
features across a block of related examples, learners have
to disregard the surface features; in the process they might
isolate the structural features and incorporate these into
their problem schemas (Quilici & Mayer, 1996).

Participants
Undergraduates that had not previously completed a
college-level course on probability or statistics
participated. Sixty-five participants completed the study
and were compensated with course credit.

Materials
Learning materials. Part one of the probability learning
materials was an introduction to the probability domain,
which explained general concepts (e.g., the concept of a
random experiment or selection with replacement). Part
two of the learning materials contained a set of 10 worked
examples of probability word problems. The worked
examples had each step worked and explicated with text
descriptions of the step and the rationale for the step.
There were two worked examples for each type of
formula used to solve a problem; each worked example
had a unique cover story. Five types of word problems
were used (see Table 1). Note that the first type of
problem is different from the other four; the first problem
illustrates that when a conjunction of probability events is
of interest, the probability of the individual events are
multiplied together to compute the probability of the
overall event. The other four problems illustrate that
complex events can also be solved by applying a specific
formula. In these problems the appropriate formula is
determined by two features: (1) whether the order in
which items are selected is of importance (i.e.,
permutation or combination) and (2) whether items are
replaced after each trial (i.e., with replacement or without
replacement). These last four types of problems use a
strategy we label the category approach. In the category
approach strategy, learners are taught to classify the

Randomize structural features
A different approach to ordering worked examples comes
from research on distribution of practice (Jacoby, 1978)
and contextual interference (Shea & Morgan, 1979).
Increasing the spacing between studying related items
increases the probability of recalling that item (Jacoby,
1978). Thus, when studying worked examples, increasing
the spacing between related items might force the learner
to reconstruct the earlier studied example (i.e., build a
representation of the current example and then recognize
a related representation in long-term memory). The effort
of reconstructing the representation could lead to better
recall and more robust schemas. There are other
theoretical explanations about why a distribution of
structurally identical worked examples should be used.
Some researchers (e.g., Shea & Morgan, 1979) argue that
examples of different types should be interspersed
because it allows learners to compare and contrast
different features of each example. When the types of
examples are not blocked, and appear random to the
learner, then the learner does not know a priori to which
category the example belongs. Thus the learner must
compare previous items with the current item and
compare and contrast until he or she isolates the features

problem based on the two features and then select the
appropriate formula for that category. Note that any
complex probability that can be solved with the category
approach can also be solved by multiplying individual
simple probabilities (i.e., formula 1 in Table 1). Although
this was not explicitly explained to participants, some
recognized it and thus solved problems with an
individual-event approach (Gerjets, Scheiter, &
Catrambone, 2004), rather than the category approach that

we expected them to use. The implications of this are
discussed in the results section.
The order of the worked examples varied by condition.
In the blocked group, both examples of a given problem
type were grouped together (see Table 2). In the random
group, the worked examples were ordered such that from
the point of view of the participant, the type of problem
appeared to be randomly ordered; no worked example
was preceded or followed by a worked example of the
same
problem
type
(see
Table
2).

Test items. After studying the learning materials,
participants were given an 11-item test. Five items were
isomorphs of the worked examples. These isomorphic
items were each a particular category of probability word
problem and therefore had one correct formula (see Table
3). Additionally, there were six transfer items (3 near
transfer and 3 far transfer items). These transfer items
each contained essentially two word problems. That is,
there are two different complex probabilities that need to
be computed individually and then combined using
multiplication. Each of the complex probabilities have
one correct formula associated with them; near transfer
items have the same two categories (and thus the same
two formulas) whereas far transfer items have two
different categories (and thus two different formulas; see
Table 3).

Procedure
Participants first completed the learning phase, in which
they worked through materials (introduction and worked
examples) at their own pace. Participants were told that
they would be given a formula sheet during the test phase
and thus did not have to memorize the formulas but that
they would need to learn how to apply the formulas. The
test phase followed the learning phase. Participants were
given an 11-item test to complete within 35 minutes. They
were free to work through the items in any order, and
were encouraged to skip items if they could not solve
them, in order to attempt each item.

Cover story
Ten knights participate in the "9th King's
Tournament". The king provides the tournament
with 12 horses. The knights have to pick their
horses blindfolded. The heaviest knight gets to
pick first, then the second heaviest, and so on.
What is the probability of the heaviest knight
getting the biggest horse, the second heaviest
knight getting the second biggest horse, and the
third heaviest knight getting the third biggest
horse?

At a soccer game there are two dressing rooms for
the two teams. The 11 players from Oxford wear
T-shirts with odd numbers from 1 to 21 and the 11
players from Manchester have even numbers from
2 to 22. Because the aisle from the dressing rooms
is very narrow only one player at a time can enter
the field. The players of the two teams leave their
rooms alternately with a player from Oxford going
first.
What is the probability of first 5 players entering
the field having the numbers five, two, thirteen,
eight, and one (i.e., the first has the number five,
the second has the number two, and so on)?

In a car race 12 different European countries
participate with one driver per country. There are 5
prizes for the participants: The winner receives
$10,000, the second place finisher gets $5,000 and
the third place finisher receives $1,000. The fourth
and fifth place finisher each receives $500.
What is the probability that the Italian driver wins
$10,000, the German $5,000, the Swedish $1,000,
and that the French and Danish drivers each win
$500?

Scoring
We first scored each item for the strategy used to solve it
(e.g., a category approach or an individual-event
approach). This was necessary because participants
sometimes switched between a category approach and an
individual-event approach from item to item. In addition,
some participants used both the category and individualevent approach to solve the same item; when participants

We conducted a preliminary analysis using data from 40
of the 65 participants. We were interested in assessing
participants' ability to categorize the test items. We used
one specific problem-solving behavior, selecting the
correct formula, as an indicator of correct categorization
(Quilici & Mayer, 1996).

1022

used both approaches we excluded their answer because it
was unclear which strategy was their primary problemsolving method. Each attempt that was solved with the
category approach was then scored to determine whether
the participant selected the correct formula (e.g., applied
the formula n!/(n-k)! to a permutation without
replacement item).
We computed a second measure, total categorization
errors, that were defined as an instance in which the
participant used the category approach, but selected an
incorrect (or unclassifiable) formula for that item. Thus,
for each participant, categorization errors equal the
number of items solved with a category approach minus
the number of correct categorizations (i.e., errors =
category approach - correct categorization).
We also used a third measure, error rate, which was the
proportion of errors to categorization opportunities (i.e.,
rate = errors / category approach). To illustrate, consider a
hypothetical participant, Participant 1. Participant 1 used
the category approach on three out of the five isomorphic
items, and correctly categorized two of the isomorphic
items. Therefore, his error score is 1 (3-2) and his error
rate is .33 (1/3).

On isomorphic items the blocked group made
significantly more categorization errors (see Table 4),
F(1, 27) = 6.73, MSE = 1.4, p = .02. The blocked group
also had a higher categorization error rate than the
random group (see Table 4), F(1, 27) = 4.76, MSE = 0.10,
p = .041. On transfer items the blocked and random
groups did not differ in the number of categorization
errors nor in their categorization error rates (see Table 4),
both F's < 1.

Discussion
The random condition had fewer errors than the
blocked condition on items that were isomorphic to the
worked examples. The random order was more successful
than the blocked order in facilitating schema construction
and subsequent categorization. This suggests that
participants in the random condition were more successful
at creating schemas that could be retrieved from longterm memory and applied to the problem representation,
despite the fact that the test items had different surface
features than the studied examples.
However, the order of the worked examples did not
appear to affect errors on transfer items; no reliable order
effect was found. The transfer items required participants
to create a problem representation that was different from
any stored schema. That is, participants had to combine
two complex probability formulas (e.g., formulas 2 - 4 in
Table 1) by multiplying the probability events together
(e.g., formula 1 in Table 1). These transfer items therefore
had different surface and structural features compared to
the studied worked examples. Based on these results, it
does not appear that alternating the structural features of
worked examples (i.e., random ordering) is sufficient to
allow learners to create schemas that are robust enough to
support reorganization to deal with novel problem
representations.

Analysis strategy
To analyze categorization errors and error rates we
excluded participants that did not use the category
approach for any of the items. Again, consider
hypothetical participants. If Participant 2 did not use the
category approach for any item then he would have 0
errors and an error rate of 0. However, if Participant 3
used the category approach for every item and categorized
every item correctly, then she would also have 0 errors
and an error rate of 0. Therefore, we excluded any
participant who performed like Participant 2; this makes
values of 0 easily interpretable.
Although three measures were computed (category
approach attempts, categorization errors, and
categorization error rates), we believe categorization error
rates are the most theoretically relevant. Error rates allow
one to compare participants' categorization data, despite
differences in the number of categorization attempts
made. We report the number of categorization attempts to
provide context for the error rates. However, we report
inferential analyses only on categorization errors and
categorization error rates. These two measures were
analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with order as a
between-subject factor.
Isomorphic and transfer items were analyzed
separately. Isomorphic items have one formula whereas
transfer items have two formulas that are multiplied
together to get the final answer. Therefore, each transfer
item has two parts, and each part has a specific formula
that must be selected. Participants could have between
zero and five categorization errors across the five
isomorphic items (one error per item) and between zero
and 12 categorization errors across the six transfer items
(two errors per item).

Although these results suggest that structurally similar
examples should be separated, we believe that our
findings are not necessarily inconsistent with Quilici and
Mayer (1996). Quilici and Mayer (Experiment 2) had two
experimental groups that each had structurally similar
problem types blocked together. However, one of these
groups, surface-emphasizing, had surface features
intentionally confounded with structural features; when
the problem type changed, the cover story changed as
well. The other group, structure-emphasizing, did not
have surface features confounded with structural features;
surface features changed independent of structural
features. The structure-emphasizing group was better than
the surface-emphasizing group at categorizing new
problems. Therefore, they argued that when surface
features are grouped, structural features should not be
confounded. In this study we used a new cover story for
each example in order to avoid confounding structural and
surface features. Therefore, our design allows us to
answer a question that Quilici and Mayer could not2:
when structural and surface features are not confounded,
should examples with the same structure be studied
together (i.e., blocked condition), or with intervening
examples of different problem types (i.e., random
condition)? Our results suggest that randomizing the order
of worked examples, such that consecutive worked
examples do not have the same structural features, is
successful in reducing categorization errors.
The benefit of a random, as opposed to blocked,
ordering might occur because learners compare and
contrast the structural features of the previous example
with the current example, and thus are better able to build
a schema with the appropriate structural features (van
MerriÃ«nboer et al., 2002). On the other hand, the random
order might be beneficial because the spacing between
examples of the same problem type is increased. As more
items intervene between study trials, learners increasingly
have to reconstruct their problem schema from long-term
memory; this reconstruction process might benefit
retention (Jacoby, 1978). Although this study is unable to
distinguish between these two possibilities, future
research could attempt disentangle these explanations.
In conclusion, these results suggest that instructional
designers should carefully consider the order in which
they present examples to learners, especially when
designing lessons with more than one problem type.
Although grouping structurally similar examples might
seem intuitive, spacing the presentation of similar
examples can improve learners' categorization ability.
Further research needs to specify which cognitive
processes are facilitated by randomizing the order of
examples. Identifying these cognitive processes can
provide predictions about specific changes to the ordering
of sequences of examples and the effect that these ordered

sequences will have on schema formation and
categorization.
