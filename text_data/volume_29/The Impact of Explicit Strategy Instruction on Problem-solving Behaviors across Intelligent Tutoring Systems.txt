Moreover, the Strategy training advantage does not seem to
be only due to increasing the search efficiency, as the gains
appeared even on single-principle problems, which do not
require any search. The learning gains on single-principle
problems may have been caused by increased motivation, or
increased acquisition of domain principles, or both. If it was
due to motivation only, then we might see little actual use of
