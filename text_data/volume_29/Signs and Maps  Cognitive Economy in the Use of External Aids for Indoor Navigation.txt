   Signs clearly support ‘computational offloading’:
navigating from sign to sign requires virtually no route
planning and no memorizing of multiple route segments. It
does require a two-fold visual search task, however,
searching (a) for the sign itself in the environment and (b)
for the crucial information on the sign. The subsequent route
decision process is primarily based on matching the room
number of the target destination with the number range of
each direction alternative on the sign (cf. Fig. 1).
   Maps provide much more information than a single
signpost. They allow for planning the route almost
completely in advance. For navigation the user needs to (a)
select information pertinent to the task at hand, (b) plan a

Participants & Experimental Design
36 participants (16 of them female) between the ages of 19
and 53 years (M= 24.1, SD= 5.9) were recruited through
postings on campus and e-mailing lists. Most of them were
students from a variety of subjects. None of them knew the
building before the study. Participants were paid or received
course credit for participation.
    Access to the external aids was varied as a between-
subjects factor: In the ‘maps-and-signs’ condition both, the
re-designed signs and maps were available to the
participant. In the ‘signs-only’ condition only signage, and                  Figure 2: Example of maps used in the study; including

the four map conditions [F(3,33) = .342, p = .80]. There was
no frequency-accuracy trade off and the improved quality of
the maps did not cause participants to spend more or less
time at them. Sign usage was different across all conditions

no difference between the signs-only and the maps-and-
signs groups [t(18) = .222, p = .83]. Thus, the availability of
maps did not decrease sign usage. In both the maps-and-
signs condition and the signs-only condition, participants
looked at the signs much more frequently than in the two
