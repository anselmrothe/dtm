Figure 3: The latent space is formed by the two first principal components of data consisting of four separate utterances
representing the sounds ‘s’, ‘o’, ‘f’, ‘a’. The structure clearly shows the sparse component mixture, with ‘rays’ emanating from
the origin (0,0). The ray embraced in a rectangle contains a mixture of ‘s’ and ‘f’ features, a cognitive component associated
with the vowel /e/ sound.
tures follows a consistent and invariant form (Damper, 1998).
Experiments involving labels related to speaker identification
also provided the signature of linear ‘ray’-structures. Is lin-
earity related to perceptually distinguishable categories? The
discussion on linear correlations in the speech signal and lo-
cus equation is still on-going (Sussman, Fruchter, Hillbert, &                                                                                                                                                                            …                                      …          …
