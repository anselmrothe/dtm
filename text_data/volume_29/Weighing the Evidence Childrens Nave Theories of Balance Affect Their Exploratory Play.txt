Gradually, children develop the correct, adult theory of
balance: “Mass Theory”. Mass Theorists understand that
in order for a block to be stable, it must be balanced over
its center of mass. Children’s understanding of balance
has subsequently been investigated by many researchers
(e.g. Halford, 2002; Janson, 2002; Normandeau, 1989;
Siegler, 1976). However, much of this literature focuses
on the transition between incorrect and correct rules and
strategies and not on the processes, like exploratory play,
that might generate the evidence that could support such
discoveries.
    Experiment 1: Center- & Mass-theorist Play
To a Center Theorist, a block with a conspicuously heavy
side balancing on its geometric center may not be
surprising; however, this evidence should surprise a Mass
Theorist. Conversely, to a Center Theorist, a block with
one heavy side balancing under its center of mass might
be surprising, but that evidence should not surprise a
Mass Theorist. To investigate how children’s theories
affect their exploratory play, we used a method similar to
the free play paradigm of Schulz and Bonawitz (in press).
