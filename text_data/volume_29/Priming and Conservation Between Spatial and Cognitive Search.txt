groups, however, shows that the two groups did not
significantly differ in the number of total key presses during
the foraging sessions (t(39) = 1.26, p = 0.21). Furthermore, if
one group were in a higher state of arousal, we should expect
the overall word submission rates in the anagram task to be
different between the two treatment groups. However,
treatment groups did not significantly differ in mean time to
submit correct or incorrect words (t(39) = 1.61, p = 0.12 and
t(39) = 1.27, p = 0.21, respectively). This suggests that
arousal state, as measured by key presses and word
submission rates, is not the cause of the greater times spent
exploring each letter set following clumpy spatial foraging.
