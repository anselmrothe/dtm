Holyoak, 1992). Causal models postulate that causes can be
either generative (making the effect happen) or preventive
(stopping the effect from happening; see Cheng, 1997;
Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005). A generative cause increases
the probability of an outcome whereas a preventive cause
decreases the probability of the outcome. Because
generative and preventive causes exert their power in
opposite directions, the distinction between generative and
preventive causes is crucial in predicting the outcome.
Previous studies of category-based induction (e.g., Rehder,
2006) have not employed preventive causes.
   In philosophy of science, Bartha (in press) has recently
extended Hesse’s (1966) work on the role of causal models
in analogy. Bartha distinguished between contributing
causes (generative) and counteracting causes (preventive) in
assessing the normative strength of arguments by analogy.          Figure 1: Example of use of causal models in analogical

used to create a booklet for each participant, three of each

items served to avoid repeated use of the same property lists
for an individual participant, as only one type of argument
per list was selected for each participant, generating three
sets. Within each set, the order of items was randomized for
each participant.
