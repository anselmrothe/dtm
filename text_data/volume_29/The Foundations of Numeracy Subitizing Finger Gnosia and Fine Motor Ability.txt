   In summary, as predicted, all component skills (subitizing,
finger gnosia, and finger tapping) contributed uniquely to
number system knowledge. As predicted, finger gnosia was

however, was not related to calculation skill. This finding

                          Discussion
In the current paper we investigated the joint and independent
contributions of each component ability (subitizing, finger

calculation skills of children in Grade 1. No correlations were        Figure 1: Regression model with semi-partial regression
