Procedure Participants completed a category verification
task like Experiment 1, but with the inclusion of a signal-to-
respond manipulation. On each trial, a category label was
displayed for 1000ms, then a premask was displayed for a
variable duration, followed by the presentation of the
stimulus image for 200ms, followed by a postmask. An
auditory signal to respond was presented to the participants
after a variable duration (12, 24, 35, 47, 94, 188, 376, 753,
or 1506 ms) from image onset. Masking was used to limit
the amount of perceptual processing in order to make the
task more difficult than unmasked viewing; the same limits
from masking were imposed at all signal-to-respond levels.
As in Experiment 1, participants verified the match or
mismatch between the category label (basic or subordinate)
and object in the stimulus image. But they could only
respond after hearing the auditory signal. A warning
message was presented if the participants responded before
the signal or if the response time after the signal was smaller
than 180ms or greater than 350ms. Participants responded
by pressing keys marked as “yes” and “no” on a keyboard.
Each session consisted of 864 trials and lasted
approximately 1 hour.
Results
The behavioral time courses along with the exponential
curve fits from each object category are shown in Figure 3.
The average curve fit parameters from each of the object
categories are also shown in Figure 3. Planned comparisons
testing for difference in asymptote, growth rate, and
intercept parameters between basic- and subordinate-level
decisions were conducted.         For objects from novice
categories (birds and dogs), no significant difference was
observed for the intercepts [t(4) < 1]. For birds, the
asymptote [t(4) = 2.87] and the growth rate [t(4) = 6.95] was       Figure 3: Behavioral time course data (circles and crosses),

categorization?
   To begin to answer this question, we simulated the
EBRW model using a highly simplified instantiation of the
basic and subordinate categories used in our experiments.
According to EBRW, objects are represented perceptually
as points in a multidimensional psychological space. Like
many other categorization models, EBRW does not specify
the details of perceptual processing, but multidimensional
representations of this sort have been used in extant object
recognition models (e.g., Edelman, 1999). To keep things as
simple as possible, we assumed a two-dimensional space.
As shown in Figure 4a, one basic-level category (black
points) was represented as a cluster of points in space, with
parameter sw specifying the within-category similarity.                 Figure 4: (a) Psychological space for EBRW simulations.
