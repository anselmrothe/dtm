   Visual Information in a Real World Domain
The science of histology is the study of the microanatomy of
biological tissue. It is a fundamental biological science and
forms the basis for the medical discipline of pathology (e.g.,
Ross, Kaye, & Pawlina, 2003). Histology is practiced in
large part through studying tissues in microscopes. Thus,
visuocognitive skill is at the center of mastering a complex
scientific domain (e.g., Crowley, Naus, Stewart, & Fried-                        Figure 1. Air passages and air sacs from the lung
