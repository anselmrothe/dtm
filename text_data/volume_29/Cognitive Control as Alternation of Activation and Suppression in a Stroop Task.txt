functional role of SIOR seems identical to the role of
memory decay (Altmann, 2002; Anderson, 1989). Questions
arise whether an additional inhibitory mechanism is
necessary and how plausible such a mechanism is from a
neuro-cognitive perspective. These questions are addressed
in the next sections.
         An ACT-R Model of Stroop Effects
   This model is largely based on the models of Altmann and
Lovett (Altmann & Davidson, 2001; Lovett, 2005) both

necessary to account for the observed between-trial effects
while preserving a good account for the within-trial effects.
   The word and the color features of the current stimulus
are encoded as parts of the goal representation and spread
activation to related information in memory. For example,
when the stimulus is the word “green” in red ink, both
features spread activation and two concepts are likely to be
retrieved – redness and greenness. If greenness is retrieved,                   Figure 1: Reaction time per condition showing

suppression of the previous stimulus reduces its chance to
interfere with the current stimulus. However, in some cases,
when a feature of the previous stimulus re-occurs with the
current stimulus, retrieval of the corresponding concept
from memory is significantly slowed down, because it has
been suppressed (i.e., negative activation has been spread
toward it). This way, as a result of activation and
suppression the model is able to account for both within-
and between-trial effects.
Results of Model Simulations
Simulations of the model have been designed to allow
comparison with the human data. The same number of
individuals and trials per individual were administrated as in
the actual study.
   In general the model was able to account for a variety of
Stroop effects and task manipulations as shown in previous
