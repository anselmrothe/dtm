   A third category of studies of perception would aim at
global aspects of the process, focusing on three main topics:
1) The role of perception within the observer system (natural
or artificial); 2) Causes for perceptual phenomena. Systemic
explanations accounting perception and also for illusions,
hallucinations, particular aspects of perception (perception of
movement, volumes, etc.) and 3) Cognitive (neuro–) science:

   We could summarize two fundamental perspectives within
this category. First, the well-known ecological theory, also
called direct perception, whose formulation can be found in                  Figure 1: Two phases of the perceptual process.
