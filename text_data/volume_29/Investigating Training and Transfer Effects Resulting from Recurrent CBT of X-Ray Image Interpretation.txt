trained with XRT before (baseline measurement). After test
completion, only one group received recurrent adaptive
CBT using XRT (training group). On average, each screener
of the training group conducted 20.26 min recurrent training
per week (SD = 3.65 min). After six months, both groups
conducted the X-ray CAT again. This approach allows the
comparison of the two test measurements and the
performance of the two groups prior to and after training
with XRT.
