Abstract

ognized more slowly than words from sparse neighborhoods
(Vitevitch & Luce, 1998).
The effects of neighborhood density on production are inconsistent. Vitevitch and colleagues have shown a facilitatory effect of neighborhood density on the production of English words (Vitevitch, 2002; Vitevitch, Armbruster, & Chu,
2004; Vitevitch & Sommers, 2003). The same researchers,
however, have found the opposite effect in Spanish. Spanish speakers produced words from dense neighborhoods more
slowly than words from sparse neighborhoods (Vitevitch &
Stamer, 2006). Additionally, the results of specific experiments have sometimes been difficult to replicate. Vitevitch &
Sommers, 2003 show fewer tip-of-the-tongue states for words
from dense neighborhoods, but fail to find any effect of neighborhood density in picture naming. This stands in contrast to
Vitevitch, 2002 and Vitevitch et al., 2004, where naming latencies were shorter for words from dense neighborhoods.
In comprehension, the inhibitory influence of neighborhood density on recognition has been attributed to
phonologically-based competition during lexical access (Mcclelland & Elman, 1986). A similar process could be involved
in production. On the other hand, an interactive activation
model of production has been used to demonstrate that shared
phonology among neighbors should lead to faster responses
and fewer errors for words from dense neighborhoods (Dell
& Gordon, 2003). At this point, the results from production
studies cannot fully explain the role that phonological similarity plays in lexical access for single word production.
One possible confound in studies of neighborhood effects
is that neighborhood density is correlated with other distributional properties in the lexicon (e.g. phonotactic probabilities;
see Vitevitch, Luce, Pisoni, & Auer, 1999). When controlling for correlated factors and trying to sample the lexicon at
different levels of other lexical properties (neighborhood density, lexical frequency), it can be difficult to gather an ideallybalanced set of stimuli for studying the interactions among
lexical properties in language processing. Furthermore, while
current methods of estimating frequency and neighborhood
density are useful, these estimates fail to account for important factors like individual experience with language. Citing these reasons and others, Magnuson et al. conducted a
series of experiments based on an artificial lexicon (2003).
Over the course of several days, subjects learned to recognize
novel shapes by their “names”. Drawing the names of the
shapes from a specially designed artificial lexicon allowed the
researchers to achieve precise control over theoretically interesting factors such as lexical frequency and neighborhood

Subjects learned to name novel shapes using words from an
artificial lexicon. Use of an artificial lexicon allowed for tight
control over properties of the words in the lexicon, including lexical frequency, neighborhood density, and phonological similarity. After training, subjects’ naming latencies and
error rates displayed some of the same performance patterns
as would be expected in natural language studies of picture
naming. These encouraging results argue for the consideration
of artificial lexicons as research tools in studies of production,
and offer exciting possibilities for future work in language processing.
Keywords: picture naming, word production, word learning,
artificial lexicon, lexical representation, phonological neighborhoods, frequency effects

In both comprehension and production, certain properties
of words are known to affect the way those words are processed. Some of these properties include lexical frequency,
phonological similarity to recently used words, and phonological neighborhood density.
Experimental evidence shows that frequency of use and
phonological structure play an important role in how a word
is processed, in both comprehension and production. Listeners recognize high-frequency words more quickly than
low-frequency words (Marslen-Wilson, 1987). Speakers produce high-frequency words more proficiently, as evidenced
by shorter naming latencies and fewer errors (Jescheniak &
Levelt, 1994; Levelt et al., 1991; Dell, 1986).
While experience with a word consistently facilitates its
processing, the impact of a word’s phonology on its use is
more varied. Exposure to an auditorily-presented phonologically related word during lexical access leads to faster naming
performance (Meyer & van der Meulen, 2000; Levelt et al.,
1991); but producing a phonologically-related word prior to
a naming a picture slows speakers down (Wheeldon, 2003).
Phonologically related words need not even be explicitly presented as primes in order to affect lexical access.
Words that are phonologically similar are referred to as
neighbors 1 (Luce & Pisoni, 1998). Words with many
neighbors are said to come from dense neighborhoods, and
words with few neighbors from sparse neighborhoods. The
density of a word’s phonological neighborhood affects its
processing, even when its neighbors are not explicitly involved in the language task. In comprehension, for example, words from dense neighborhoods are systematically rec1 In this study and most of the studies presented below, phonolog-

ical similarity is heuristically defined as a pair of words that differ
by no more than one added, altered, or deleted phoneme. See Luce
& Pisoni, 1998 for more on this “shortcut rule”.

was played 48 times. Perfect performance on all testing and
training trials would result in a subject producing each highfrequency word 202 times, and each low-frequency word 58
times. If each utterance were also considered an auditory exposure to the word, the ideal subject would have heard each
high-frequency word 394 times during the week, and each
low-frequency word 106 times. This resulted in 6000 exposures to words in the lexicon, with %78.8 of the exposures
being high-frequency words. Since no subject performed
perfectly, the exact number of exposures to high- and lowfrequency words differed slightly across subjects.
The lexicons were constructed in a manner that gave rise to
phonological neighborhoods with varying densities. Words in
high-density (HD) neighborhoods had 3 neighbors. Words in
low-density (LD) neighborhoods had 1 neighbor. There were
12 high-density words and 12 low-density words. Frequency
levels were assigned evenly within each level of neighborhood density, so that there were 6 HF-HD words, 6 HF-LD
words, 6 LF-HD words, and 6 LF-LD words (see Table 1).
The precise structure of the phonological similarity found
within a neighborhood differed across neighborhoods. Some
neighborhoods contained more onset neighbors. Onset neighbors are defined as words that are identical through the onset
and nucleus of the first syllable. Put differently, onset neighbors are those words which differ by one segment somewhere
in the second syllable. A sample of each of the types of neighborhoods found in the lexicon can be seen in Table 2.
The second lexicon was a translation of the first, where
each consonant was substituted for some other consonant, and
each vowel substituted for another vowel. In executing the
translation, voiceless consonants were exclusively swapped
with other voiceless consonants, and the same held for voiced
consonants.
A female native English speaker was recorded speaking
each of the words in the lexicons. Several samples of each
word were recorded, and the authors chose the best token for
use in the study. Words were spoken with stress on both syllables, in part to make them more distinct from English words.
The selected samples were normalized to a standard intensity.
The images used in the study were the same across both
lexicons. A large number of Attneave shapes were randomly generated using a Matlab package (Collin & Mcmullen, 2002). The authors independently evaluated the
shapes for name-ability, and then jointly selected a set of 24
equally unnameable shapes. Four sample shapes can be seen
in Figure 1.
The experiment was run on the ExBuilder experiment de-

density. Furthermore, the use of novel words meant that, in
general, subjects all started and ended with the same amount
of experience with each of the words in the lexicon. Use of an
artificial lexicon in this study allowed new insight into spoken
word recognition.
The present study is an attempt at extending this artificial
lexicon methodology to a word production task. Other researchers have used nonsense words to look at issues of frequency and phonological similarity, but it seems likely that
lexical processing is importantly different from the processing of arbitrary sequences of phonemes (Lipinski & Gupta,
2005; Cholin, Levelt, & Schiller, 2006; Dell, Reed, Adams,
& Meyer, 2000). In this sense, the important distinction is
between the use of non-words and novel words. Given that
this study requires that subjects learn to use the words in a
referential domain, we hope that the tokens that begin as nonsense words will be lexicalized during the course of training.
In this experiment we examine the interaction of frequency,
neighborhood density, and phonological similarity in the production of novel words. The goal of this study is to determine
whether words learned from an artificial lexicon come to be
used in similar ways to words from a known language, and
to investigate what processes govern the formation and use of
these new lexical representations.

Method
Participants
16 subjects participated in five 75 minute sessions on consecutive days. Subjects were all students at the University of
Rochester and were native speakers of English. Subjects received payment on each day of participation (in a sequence
of $5, $5, $10, $10, $20) for a total of $50.

Materials
Two 24-word artificial lexicons were designed for the purposes of this study. The lexicons included only bi-syllabic
words of the form CVCV. All consonants were selected from
the set {k, p,t, g, b, d}, and all vowels from the set {a, i, o, u}.
Neither consonants nor vowels were repeated within a word.
A complete lexicon can be found in Table 1.
A lexicon consisted of 12 high-frequency (HF) words
and 12 low-frequency (LF) words. High-frequency words
appeared approximately four times more often than lowfrequency words. Each high-frequency word was played 192
times over the course of training; each low-frequency word

Results
All responses in test trials were coded for correctness. In
addition, correct trials were coded for whether the entire response consisted of a single word. These trials were referred
to as “perfect”. Naming latencies are measured from the end
of the beep that cued participants to speak on every trial.
The analyses described below were carried out in the R
statistical programming environment using the lme4 and languageR packages (R Development Core Team, 2006; Bates
& Sarkar, 2007; Baayen, 2007). A summary of the results
collapsed across all days of the study can be found in Table 3.

Naming Latencies
Looking at the means in Table 3, several basic trends stand
out. High-frequency words tend to be named more quickly, as
do low-density words. In order to determine the contribution
of each of these factors to the data pattern, it is necessary to
model the results as a function of our dependent variables and
appropriate random effects.
A series of linear mixed effects models were evaluated using naming latency as the dependent variable. Only trials regarded as “perfect” were included in this analysis. Different
models represent different hypotheses about the way particular factors interact to produce the observed pattern of results.
Models can be evaluated against one another, and individual
factors can be shown to have positive or negative effects on
the model’s ability to account for the data. Subjects, items,
lexicon, and pictures are modeled as random factors. Session
number, word frequency, neighborhood density, initial syllable frequency, neighborhood density, log phonotactic likelihood, and neighborhood type are included as fixed effects
in the model. These factors all reflect the internal structure
of the artificial lexicon. Initial syllable frequency is the total
number of times the initial syllable of a word appears within
the lexicon (regardless of position). Log phonotactic likelihood is a measure of the overall probability that a particular
set of phonemes will occur in a specific order, given the patterns established in the rest of the lexicon.
To test the influence of subjects’ knowledge of English on
their performance in the artificial naming task, several posthoc covariates were also included in the model. These include
summed English syllable frequency, the English syllable frequency for the onset syllable, and the log phonotactic likelihood of the word in English. These measures were calculated
in the same manner as those based on the artificial lexicon,
but reflect the distributional properties of English. These covariates are further explored below.
Two measures of significance are available in this analysis.
The first measures the contribution of a given factor to the
model’s ability to account for the data. Individual factors are
removed from the model, resulting in a change in the degrees
of freedom in the model and in the log likelihood of the data
given the model (denoted λ). A χ2 -test is performed on the
log likelihood values with the change in degrees of freedom
in the model as the d.f. for the test. A significant difference in

Procedure
On each day subjects completed a series of five training
blocks followed by two testing blocks. Each training block
consisted of 120 trials (8 presentations per HF word, 2 per LF
word); each testing block consisted of 24 trials (one presentation per word).
Each subject was assigned to one of the two lexicons on
the first day. At the beginning of a subject’s first session,
a random mapping from words to images was generated for
that subject. This mapping stayed consistent across days of
training for a given subject, but each subject had a unique
mapping.
Subjects were instructed to name the picture displayed on
the screen as quickly and accurately as possible as soon as
they heard a beep. It was further explained that when subjects were uncertain about the name of the shape, they should
always name the shape according to their best guess. These
instructions were consistent across all types of training and
testing trials. On each trial, subjects were presented with a
blank white screen for 500 ms, followed by the display of
one of the pictures. After 500 ms subjects either heard the
name of the shape or were cued to name the shape by a puretone beep (depending on the type of trial). If on any trial the
subject did not speak within 3 seconds of the beep, the trial
ended and the subject was warned to speak more quickly.
Subjects participated in two types of training trials: repetition trials and supervised learning trials. In repetition trials, subjects heard the name of the shape followed by a the
beep, at which point they were to repeat the word they had
just heard. In supervised naming trials, subjects were cued to
speak after 1 second. After subjects had named the picture on
the screen, the correct name of the picture was played. During
testing trials subjects named the displayed shape and received
no feedback on their response.
The schedule of training and testing blocks changed from
day to day. There were four repetition trials the first day, three
the second, and so on until there was a single repetition trial
on day five. Day one includes one supervised naming, and
there is one more supervised training block each day. There
are two blocks of testing each day.

log likelihood scores means that the factor contributes meaningfully to the model’s ability to describe the data.
Among the lexical factors included in the model, session, frequency, and neighborhood density, all have significant effects on the model’s performance (session: χ2∆λ (1) =
93.85, p < 0.00001); frequency: χ2∆λ (1) = 6.16, p < 0.01;
density: χ2∆λ (1) = 7.40, p < 0.01. Importantly, neighborhood type does not affect the model’s performance significantly (χ2∆λ (4) = 5.41, p > 0.2). The random effects for subject, word, and image were also significant (subject: χ2∆λ (1) =
286.67, p < 0.0001; word: χ2∆λ (1) = 3.89, p < 0.05; image:
χ2∆λ (1) = 4.51, p < 0.05). As expected, the lexicon a subject
was assigned to did not significantly affect the model’s fit to
the data. None of the English-based covariates contributed
significantly to the model (all p > 0.15).
Given this understanding of the role of the candidate factors in explaining the data, it is possible to ask how the significant factors impact subjects’ performances. Specifically, the
parameter estimates for frequency, neighborhood, and session reflect the change in naming latency between levels of
those factors. A Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation was
performed on the full model to test significance and establish confidence intervals for the parameter estimates. Subjects improved their naming speed by an estimated 46.59
ms with each day of training (p < 0.0001). Low-frequency
words were estimated to be named 41.74 ms slower than
high-frequency words (p < 0.05). Low-density words were
found to be named 63.28 ms faster than high-density words
(p < 0.01). These results are summarized in Figure 2.
Two different methods of significance testing have converged on the same set of results. Subjects tend to get
faster over the course of training, are faster to name highfrequency words than low-frequency words, and are faster to
name low-density words than they are to name high-density
words. While overall neighborhood density does impact naming speed, the composition of a word’s neighborhood does
not.

model. This family of model is appropriate to this data set
because the response is binary—correct or incorrect. The full
model of the error data included the same terms as the full
latency model.
Testing the contribution of individual factors to the fit
of the model reveals significant decreases in model performance when frequency, session, or neighborhood composition is excluded (session: χ2∆λ (1) = 1069.50, p < 0.0001; frequency: χ2∆λ (1) = 52.58, p < 0.0001; neighborhood composition: χ2∆λ (5) = 12.498, p < .05). Again, the random effects
all significantly improve the performance of the model (all
p < 0.0001), with the exception of which lexicon the subject
was assigned to (p > 0.50). Neither phonotactic likelihood
nor overall syllable frequency significantly improves the performance of the model (both p > 0.50); there was a marginal
effect of onset syllable frequency (χ2∆λ (1) = 3.48, p < 0.10).
We can also examine contrasts within the factors that contribute to explaining the error data. Parameter values are
tested against the null hypothesis that the factor does not con-

tribute to the model (a parameter value of 0). Using the model
discussed above, we find that the parameters corresponding
to frequency and session are significant (both p < 0.001).
Planned contrasts were carried out to investigate the role
of neighborhood density and phonological similarity. The
parameter representing neighborhood density is not significantly different than 0, meaning that a word’s neighborhood
density does not contribute to its the likelihood of producing
it correctly. The parameter estimates for session, frequency,
and neighborhood density are shown in Figure 3.

between pairs of measurements. The left hand side of the
figure reports two measures of correlation (r and Pearson’s r)
along with significance levels.
We find that the phonotactics of the artificial lexicon are
strongly negatively correlated with those of English. This reflects the fact that the lexicon was constructed without regard
for English phonotactic distributions—while the words were
chosen to be pronounceable, they were not selected to resemble existing English words. The end result is that the words
that are most likely to be English words are the least representative of the internal phonotactic distributions of the artificial
lexicon. There is also a significant positive correlation between phonotactic likelihood and syllable frequency within
the lexicon. This can be explained by observing that many
syllables are repeated across the lexicon, and a common syllable will also include high transitional probabilities between
its onset consonant and nucleus.
The behavioral results showed no influence of English
knowledge on naming performance in the artificial lexicon
naming tasks. This analysis reveals that the units that make
up the words in the lexicon (phonemes and syllables) are distributed quite differently in the lexicon and in English. These
differences may have cued learners to track the distributional
properties of the new words separately from those of known
English words.

LD vs. HD

Figure 3: Parameter estimates for error rates
Both estimates of initial syllable frequency are marginally
significant (both p < 0.10). Words with a high initial syllable frequency within the lexicon are slightly less likely to
be produced correctly, while words with high initial syllable
frequency in English are slightly more likely to be produced
correctly.

Influence of English
Many studies of nonsense word production have shown
“bleed in” effects from a speaker’s native language, including effects of phonotactics and of syllable frequency (Cholin
et al., 2006). For both dependent measures (reaction time and
error rates) we failed to find any impact of the distributional
properties the words would have if they were in the English
lexicon (with the exception of the marginally significant advantage in error rates for words with a high English onset syllable frequency). To further examine the relationship between
English and the artificial lexicon, a correlational analysis was
performed comparing the distribution of summed syllable frequency and log phonotactic likelihood in the two languages.
The results are displayed in Figure 4.
The figure shows the distribution of each measurement in
a histogram on the diagonal. The right hand side of the figure

Discussion
This study offers a promising look at the potential usefulness
of artificial lexicons in studying language production. We
999

replicated classic frequency effects in both naming latencies
and error rates after just five days of exposure to a relatively
subtle frequency distinction (c.f. Levelt et al., 1991; Dell,
1986).
We found an inhibitory effect of neighborhood density on
naming latencies, consistent with the results of some studies
of neighborhood effects in production (Vitevitch & Stamer,
2006). While this finding fails to replicate the facilitatory effects of neighborhood density observed in English, it is possible that the artificial lexicon technique will allow us to design
stimuli that will reveal the cause for these disparate findings.
Finally, while we found an effect of neighborhood density
on naming, we found an effect of neighborhood structure on
error rates. This indicates that phonology may play different roles at different points in lexical processing. Lexical selection may be sensitive to similarity in the onset of a word,
leading to poorer performance in neighborhoods where the
similarity tends to be loaded at the front end of the word. Articulatory planning or phoneme selection may be influenced
more globally by phonological similarity, leading to effects
of neighborhood density on naming latencies.
