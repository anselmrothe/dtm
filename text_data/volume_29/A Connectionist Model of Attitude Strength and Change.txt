Chen & Chaiken, 1999) argue that there are two important
routes toward attitude change. The first route requires
concentrated cognitive effort and attention and
comprehension of the central message. The second route is
much less effortful, only using learned cognitive shortcuts
(heuristics) or other processing mechanisms that require
minimal effort. Both models suggest that the type of change
these routes to persuasion induce are not the same, for
example stating that the more cognitive effort that is
involved in processing the message, the more stable the
resulting attitude will be. However, a competing theory,
dubbed the Unimodel of persuasion (Kruglanski &
Thompson, 1999) claims that there is only one processing
mechanism, and the two types of persuasion suggested by
the above models are the same but only vary in complexity.
