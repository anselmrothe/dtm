practice. Further, for a drill trial, the updateDrillPair
function accounts for the success or failure of that practice.
Success or failure may lead to differences in learning due to
the difference between successful recall and passive study.
Further, success means the pair was better learned prior to
the drill and this can be used to adjust the model as
described in the next section.
