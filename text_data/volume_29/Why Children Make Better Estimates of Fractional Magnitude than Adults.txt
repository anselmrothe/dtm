Results and Discussion
Our principal analysis was to compare the performance of
“learners,” those children who were best fit by the linear
function on the posttest number line estimation task, to “non
learners,” those children who were best fit by the
logarithmic function on the posttest number line estimation
task, on the fractional units task.
   As predicted, children who learned to provide linear
estimates on the number line task were less accurate (p’s <
.01) than random responding (modeled in three Monte Carlo
simulations), whereas children who continued to generate
logarithmic estimates on the number line task were not
different from random responding. Learners’ overall errors
