However, how shall we define similarity along a given                of relevant display areas and the decision about the target
stimulus dimension in such complex stimuli? For example,             location.
in the color example shown in Figure 1 (bottom), it does not
seem to be one dominant or average hue that guides search,
but rather a combination of two hues, namely red and green.
To account for this complexity, we compute the similarity
of histograms for the given stimulus dimension rather than
the similarity of average values. Features along every
dimension whose guidance we would like to study are
divided into ten intervals of equal size. Then histograms –
the number of pixels falling into each of the ten intervals –
are computed for the target and for local 64×64 pixel areas
in each display. Adjacent areas are placed in such a way that
they overlap by 50%, which leads to the computation of 676
histograms pre display.
   To compute the similarity between the target and a local
area for a given dimension, we use the histogram
intersection distance (Swain & Ballard, 1991), which has
been successfully applied to image retrieval problems.

seconds was entered. In order to assess the accuracy of the
participants’ performance, we distinguished between two
variables: First, we measured the variable response
accuracy, defined as the proportion of trials in which the
participants’ gaze position during manual response was
closer than 2° of visual angle to the center of the target area.
Second, we measured cover accuracy as the proportion of
trials during which participants fixated at least once within a
radius of 2° from the center of the target area. The
motivation for introducing this second variable was that the
task was so difficult that participants often saw the target
quite quickly but could not decide – or not decide correctly
– which of two or more similar areas contained the target.
   A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the
factors chromaticity (grayscale vs. color) and measurement
(response vs. cover accuracy) revealed that accuracy was
greater for color (response: 0.317; cover: 0.543) than for
