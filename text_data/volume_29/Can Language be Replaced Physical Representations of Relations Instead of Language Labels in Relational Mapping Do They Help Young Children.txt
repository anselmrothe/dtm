Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that 4 years old children will succeed in
transitive relational mapping significantly better when there
is a physical representation of the relation (the “draw-bars”)
than if there is no such representation.
Design
The experiment has a between group design and the
manipulated variable is presence or absence of physical
representations of the relations between objects:
   • Draw-bar condition: the animals are connected via
      draw-bars in order to make a “train”.
   • Control condition: the animals are not physically
      connected and the concept of “train” is not introduced.
The dependent variable is the number of relational
responses.
