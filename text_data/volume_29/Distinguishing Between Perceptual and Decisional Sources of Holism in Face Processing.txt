Each trial consisted of passing a study face through the model
and saving in memory the representation of this face at the
hidden layer of the model’s neural network (this is akin to some
form of visual working memory). As with the task used with
human observers, the test face could have both parts the same
as the study face, one part the same and one part different, or
both parts different. Following Cottrell et al. (2002), attention
to the cued part (top or bottom) was simulated by attenuating
the Gabor layer representation of the to-be-ignored face half by
a factor of 0.125. The correlation between the hidden layer
representation of the study phase and the hidden layer
representation of the test faces was used to generate a same or
different response (to that half) by comparing that correlation
with a criterion. Correlations higher than the criterion yield
“same” responses, those lower than the criterion yield
“different” responses. The process was repeated for the other
half in order to generate the other same/different response. The               Figure 3. Congruency effect (top), marginal d’ values
