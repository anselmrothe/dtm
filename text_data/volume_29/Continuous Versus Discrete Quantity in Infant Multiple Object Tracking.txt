                                                                               result in changes of perimeter, we designed our studies so

that we could look separately at the effect of changes of
total number, total area, and total perimeter.
      We used Káldy and Leslie’s (2003) two-screen
methodology to test whether infants track discrete or
continuous quantities through occlusion. To succeed, infants
had to attend to the locations of the objects as well as the
objects themselves. We pitted discrete number against area
in test displays. Either numerical outcome changed or total
area changed, but not both. If infants tracked based on
continuous quantities, they should have looked longer only
at outcomes where area or perimeter changed even when
number remained the same. If infants tracked based on
discrete variables, they should have looked longer only at
numerically different outcomes, even if area remained
constant. Because perimeter and area cannot be
simultaneously controlled, all non-control outcomes had
changes in total perimeter. However, in conditions where
number did not change, total perimeter change was always
equal to or less than perimeter change in number change
conditions. In this way, we were able to investigate the role
of perimeter change separately from that of area change.
      This methodology also allows us to rigorously test for a
familiar-number preference Looking-time patterns will
show whether infants developed a familiarity preference for
the total number (three). In test trials, if we remove the
screen covering the pair, we can test for outcomes of one
(unexpected), two (expected), and three (unexpected, but
possibly ‘familiar’). If infants look longer only at the
outcome of three but not also at the outcome of one, this
would be consistent with a familiarity preference for total
number. We can also determine if infants develop a
familiarity preference for the pair. If so, then they will look
longer only at (expected) outcomes of two. However, if              Figure 1: Experiment 1. Infants were familiarized to three
