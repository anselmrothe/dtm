started with a centrally located fixation cross (1500ms), that
the participants were required to fixate on in order to
initially centralize their attention. This was followed by the
presentation of the ambiguous bi-stable array (1000ms). The
participants were instructed to remember just the contour of
the array. The experimenter strictly avoided any reference to
the shapes that were formed on either side of the contour.
The ambiguous array was then removed and following a                     Fig. 3. RTs and percentage errors in each condition. Error
