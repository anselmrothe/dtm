    This implies that there needs to be some form of mem-

extra units. Each of these units is a shunting model as de-
veloped by Grossberg (1982). Basically, a shunting unit is
a time delayed store of the difference of the excitatory and
inhibitory inputs it is receiving. In our model each shunting
unit receives excitatory input from one of the competing units
