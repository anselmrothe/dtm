Thus the output units had learned to ignore the responses of
those lower-level nodes that were not relevant for
categorization and combined together those parts which were
relevant, forming diagnostic shape detectors (Figure 5C, 5D).
The formation of the detectors was not influenced by the
number of lower-level competitive units that participated in
the shape representation. The result was the same with
smaller 4x4 receptive fields. This change led only to the same
diagnostic shape detectors being composed of four instead of
two competitive units. The competitive units participating in a
detector’s representation were specialized for small input
patterns contained within their receptive fields. The global
representation activated by the whole input pattern, however,
was a continuous shape honoring the Gestalt principle of
good continuation.
   In a second simulation, a vertical categorization rule was
applied to a network with identical parameters. This time
patterns 4A and 4C were from the same category (1, 0) while
patterns 4B and 4D were from the other (0, 1).
