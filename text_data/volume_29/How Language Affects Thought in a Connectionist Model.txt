                          Discussion
The results we obtained were consistent with the findings of
Boroditsky et al.: (1) In the object description paradigm,
there was a significant language by item interaction
indicating that the networks’ description of a given item was
masculine- or feminine- biased depending on the language
the network “spoke”, and thus on the grammatical gender of
the item in that language. (2) In the object-person picture
similarity paradigm, there was a significant language by
object gender by person gender interaction indicating that
the networks’ similarity ratings were higher when the
object’s grammatical gender and the person’s biological
gender were consistent (both feminine, or both masculine)
than when they were not (one feminine, one masculine). (3)
