(Figure 3), the fixation order for the reversers is similar to
the non-reversers. Both reversers and non-reversers were
most likely to fixate the eye after the beak or the mouth.
After reversers and non-reversers looked at the eye, then the
beak was more likely to be fixated than the mouth. Both
reversers and non-reversers rarely fixated the beak after the
mouth or vice versa.
