the existing tutor includes several mechanisms that reduce
cognitive load demands on students: the tutor supports a

tutor that we developed for this experimental work.
Split-Source (Table-based) Tutor Format In the standard
version of the Geometry Cognitive Tutor, all interactions
take place in a table that is spatially separate from the
relevant geometry diagram (see Figure 1). Students enter
their solutions in the table and the tutor’s feedback is
displayed in the table. In addition to the numerical values
for geometric quantities (such as angle measures), students
must name a geometry rule that justifies each step.

earlier, these items required students to reason about

false answers required students to recognize inappropriate
applications and to reason about how geometry rules could
