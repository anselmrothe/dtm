Attending to the bank
Finally, we computed an index of how often attention was
paid to the bank by calculating how many label updates
were made in the bank. For the examples in Table 3, the
number of label updates in the bank was 0, 1 and 2,
respectively.
                        Results
We separated correct and error trials because solutions
leading to correct answers are likely to differ from those
leading to errors in terms of strategies and biases. We

independent factor (learning condition: reinforcement,                Figure 5: Selection complexity as a function of learning
