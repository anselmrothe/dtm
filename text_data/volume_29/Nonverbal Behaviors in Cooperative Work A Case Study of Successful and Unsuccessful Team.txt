3. Complexity of assembly procedure: We designed the assembly procedure of the large structure to be like solving a
wire puzzle. The participants could not complete the large
structure by assembling the two frames after constructing
them independently. They needed to start construction of
the inner frame during construction of the outer frame. The
complexity of the assembly procedure was designed to require the participants to reassemble frames at least once.

Construction materials: outer frame, inner frame and pipes.

4. Type of components: Pipes are selected as the components of the structure in this experiment because their shape
makes it easy to observe the movement of the participants’
gaze, since they do not include any planar surface. Moreover, attaching the sensors on the components makes it
easy to identify the position of the participants’ gaze on
the part of a pipe or joint.

different kinds and numbers of pipes and joints. The structure was composed of two main frames, i.e. the inner and
outer frames (Figure 1 (c) and (e)).

Design of the task
The focus of our observations was the effect of the participants’ gaze and motion during cooperative work. In designing the experimental setting for cooperative work, we constructed a large structure made from assembled pipes while
considering the following points:
1. Size of structure: We adopted structural components that
were so large that it was difficult for a single participant to
construct the structure on his own. When the participants
joint or disjoint two components in assembling the structure, two or more of them should be engaged in this work
at the same time. The size of the components as well as
the structure make collaborative assembly work a practical
necessity.
2. Configuration of structure: The large structure consists
of two main frames: the outer and the inner frame. Three
participants are assigned to construct two frames. Thus the
correspondence between the number of participants and the
number of frames is not a one-to-one relationship. This
configuration of the structure is designed to let us observe
the conditions of collaborative relationships among the participants.

5. Similarity among components: the detailed shape of the
twelve components are different except for pipe-o5 and
pipe-o6. However, it is difficult to distinguish them at a
glance because these components consist of similar pipes
and joints with similar color and location of sensors. The
similarity in shape among the components is expected to
promote communication among participants in order to
confirm their activities toward task completion.

Capturing environment
A Vicon Motion Capture System with 60-Hz time resolution and 1-mm space resolution captured body motions and
locations using optical markers. In this preliminary experiment’s setting these factors were captured within the following space: 750 x 650 x 250 (width/depth/height) (see Figure
2, left). The directions of the participants’ gazes were measured by head-mounted eye trackers (EMR-8B, Nac Image
Technology Inc.) with 30-Hz time resolution and 0.15-degree
angle resolution. The speech of participants was recorded using close-proximity microphones.
Each participant wore a cap with an eye tracker, a closeproximity microphone, and body suits with optical markers
for the motion capture device (Figure 2, right). The following

Speech: A speech unit in cooperative work is the duration
of a single participant’s speech bounded by pauses longer
than 200 ms. The speech unit includes back-channel responses, i.e., hai (yeah.), sou sou (that’s right.). However,
it does not include laughing, coughs and breathing sound.

information was recorded synchronously: visual images, 2D coordinates of gaze, 3-D coordinates of motion, and the
voices of the participants.

Procedures
Capturing devices were attached to participants as described
in the previous section. After calibration of the capturing devices, participants were instructed to assemble a large structure by using twelve kinds of components and by referring to
the completed picture (Figure 1(a)). They were also informed
that the task’s time limit was twenty minutes. No participant
was assigned a particular role, such as leader or director. At
the start of this task, all participants stood on even ground.

Gaze: The directions of the participants’ gazes are estimated
from the positions of eye mark characters superimposed on
a view image of the participants.

The upper part of Figure 4 shows phases of the task for
both groups, C1 and C2. From the data on the C1 group, every participant constructed a different frame of the structure,
especially in the middle of the task. On the other hand, from
the data on the C2 group, three participants constructed the
same frame together.

From these results, the members of the successful C2 team
might look mutually at one another and also might look at
the same person at the same time more frequently than do the
members of the unsuccessful C1 team. Therefore, prediction
(b) was partly verified.

was not verified.

Discussion

Gaze to components of the large structure

Two groups assembled a large structure, similar to ”pipe furniture,” by using twelve kinds of pipe components. One group
succeeded in building the structure within the time limit of
twenty minutes. On the other hand, the other group failed to
complete the task. This case study showed that the successful
and unsuccessful teams used different nonverbal behaviors,
especially gaze, as they assembled the structure. The members of the successful team looked mutually and looked at the
same participant at the same time more frequently and longer
than do the members of the unsuccessful team. The members

and C2 groups. Table 5 shows the ratio (%) and frequency

of the unsuccessful team looked at the same picture of the
completed structure at the same time more frequently than the
successful team. From the observation results, all members of
the successful team assembled as a group the same frame of
the structure, while members of the unsuccessful team assembled different frames in the middle of the task. These results
suggest that mutual and shared gazes to the other participants
play an important role in the smooth progression of the task of
assembling a large structure. However, due to the small scale
of the preliminary experiment, the results cannot be generalized to other types of cooperative work. This is because the
use of nonverbal behavior may vary according to the size of
the task space, the materials used, and the number of participants.
Our findings have two main implications. First, mutual
gaze and shared gaze to the same worker seemed to facilitate the process of the cooperative work. In this task, the
participants of neither group seemed to make conversation
with each other. The ratio and frequency of both speech and
gaze to other participants were not much different between
the groups (Table 2 and Table 3). It’s possible that the participants pay attention to and monitor the behaviors of other
participants by using mutual gaze and shared gaze to the same
participant as well as using conversation. As a second implication, shared gaze to the same object seemed to confirm the
process of cooperative work. In this task, the participants of
both groups seemed to look at the objects, including the pictures of the completed structure and its components, rather
than at the other participants. The ratio and frequency of gaze
to the completed structure’s picture and to the components of
the architecture were much different (Table 3 from the results
in Table 5). In particular, the unsuccessful team more often
seemed to look at the same picture of the completed structure
at the same time than did the successful team. They might use
this shared gaze to correct their assembly errors and to check
the status of the task.
Previous research has regarded gaze as playing an important supporting role to the main activity of conversation
(Clark, 1996; Jarmon, 1996; Kendon, 1967; Otsuka et al.,
2006). Mutual gaze is also considered to support turn-taking
in conversation and to improve one’s ability to give intimate
impressions to the interaction partner (Argyle & Cook, 1976;
Vertegaal & Ding, 2002). On the other hand, authors note
another case study of visual measurement, i.e. virtual tracing of component size and shape, using the same task as used
in this paper (Suzuki et al., 2006). Gaze is assumed to take
precedence in interaction not only for deciding the next move
in non-conversation games, such as Shogi (Japanese Chess),
played on desktop space (T. Ito et al., 2005) but also for engaging others in cooperative work carried out in a large space.

Some of the authors have joined the Ultra-realistic Communication System Group in the National Institute of Information and Communication Technology of Japan (NICT).
The purpose of the project is to construct a system for embodied interaction with remote partners by improving the reality of interaction, i.e., using 3-D video, 3-D audio, olfaction
and tactile sense. A multi-point cooperative work system using a large space is one of the candidates for an ultra-realistic
communication system. Implications from this face-to-face
cooperative work task could be applied to the design and evaluation method of such a system with remote partners.
