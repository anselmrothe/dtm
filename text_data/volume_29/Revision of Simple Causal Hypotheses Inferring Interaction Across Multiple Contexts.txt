      Inferring an Interaction Across Contexts
   The psychological debate about human causal learning
has focused on the distinction between covariation and
causation, and has been carried out in the context of two
models that both yield estimates of causal strength: The ΔP
rule (e.g., Jenkins & Ward, 1965), which strictly assesses
covariation, and the power-PC theory (Cheng, 1997),

Experiment 2: A control for the influence of P(e|c)
In the previous experiment, P(e|c), the probability of effect e
in the presence of cause c, was 1.0 for both studies in the
Power-Constant Group but varied across studies in the
Power-Varying Group. It is possible that participants
simply based their judgments about whether the influence of
c differs across data sets on how often e occurs in the
presence of c. In Experiment 2 causal power is instead held
constant at 0.75 in the Power-Constant Group and increases
from 0.25 to 0.75 in the Power-Varying Group. Meanwhile,
P(e|c) varies across hypothetical studies in both groups. Our
two experiments used the same method, except that
participants in Experiment 2 were presented with 4
hypothetical studies rather than 2.                                        Figure 2: Mean causal strength ratings from Experiment 2 as a
