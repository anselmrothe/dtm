                           Introduction
People are better at recognizing faces from their own race
than from different races (Shapiro & Penrod, 1986; Bothwell
et al., 1989). This is known as the other-race effect, cross
race effect or own race bias. Most researchers agree that this
phenomenon is caused by the learning history; the fact that
people have more experience with their own race faces dur-
ing development results in more accurate recognition. As mi-
norities usually do not have an other race effect for the major-
ity, it might be more appropriate called an unfamiliar facial
structure effect. It was reported that while six year old chil-
dren did not show a significant other-race effect, older partic-
ipants show a degree of the effect positively correlated with
age (Chance et al., 1982). Feingold suggested that the degree              Figure 1: A sample stimulus in the visual search task. The

more important than mere contact (Shepard, 1981; Valentine                    Levin’s finding, referred to as the advantage of CR faces in
et al., 1995). This leads to the hypothesis of optimal feature             visual search, seems to be in conflict with the decreased accu-

Search asymmetry refers to the phenomenon that the response
time slope typically changes when the role of the target and
distractor are switched (see (Wolfe, 2001a) for a review). For
example, a bar tilted 15 degrees will “pop out” among ver-
tical bars, but a sole vertical bar among tilted bars seems to
produce a serial search, where the search time goes up lin-             Figure 3: “Prototypes” do not pop out. Finding the tilted
