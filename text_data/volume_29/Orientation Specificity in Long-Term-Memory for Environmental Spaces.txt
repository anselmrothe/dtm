Christou & Bülthoff, 1999; Mallot & Gillner, 2000; Wang
& Spelke, 2002). The defining characteristic of view-
dependent theory is that performance is assumed to be
highest when one is aligned with the originally experienced
orientation. Note that view-dependent representations are
not modified or updated when one moves around.
According to the definition by Klatzky et al. (1998), such a
representation is classified as allocentric, as it is not
dependent on the current position and orientation of the
navigator. Similar to the two previously described theories,
the current theory is based on location-to-location (object-
to-object) information or allocentric representations.
Alternatively, view-dependent theory can also be
conceptualized as an egocentric representation (e.g.,

Spelke, 2002).                                                         Figure 1: The virtual reality setup. The left image depicts

   Using this setup, the participants walked through a virtual
environment that consisted of seven connected straight
corridors of different colors and wall textures (see Figure 2).
The corridors formed one closed loop without any junctions.
Seven distinct target objects were placed at a height of 1.3
m, one in each corridor within a circular room. The seven
target objects (a brush, telephone, shoe, watch, scissors,
banana, and book) were selected to be similar to the objects
used in earlier studies investigating the reference direction
theory (e.g., Mou et al., 2004). To ensure that participants
experienced the corridors only from one direction, they
always walked through the corridor in a clockwise direction,
without ever turning around. The structure of the

indeed acquire knowledge of the layout.
Participants’ pointing accuracy varied as a function of local
(experienced) orientation (see Figure 3; ANOVA within
subjects; F(7, 133) = 3.11, p = .005, η² = .14).1 As predicted
by the view-dependent theory, they pointed more accurately
when oriented in the direction in which they had
experienced the corridor (0°) than when oriented in another
direction (t(19) = 3.99, p = .001, d = 0.89). An alternative
explanation of the results might be a speed-accuracy trade-
off. However, the differences in pointing accuracy due to
differences in pointing time, could be ruled out, as there was
no effect of local orientation on pointing time (F(7, 133) =                  Figure 4: Pointing accuracy as a function of global

   Participants’ performance did not depend on the global
