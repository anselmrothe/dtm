measures of circulatory system knowledge meet common
fit criteria?
Before moving to our structural model and a test of the
first of our two main research questions, it was necessary
to assess the measurement model using confirmatory
factory analyses (CFA; Kline, 2004). In this case, the
CFA involved both continuous (matching, labeling, flow)
and categorical (mental model) indicators both at pretest
and posttest. This type of CFA was performed using
