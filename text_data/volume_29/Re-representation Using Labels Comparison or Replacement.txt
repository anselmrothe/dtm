Rationale for the Present Study
The goal of the present experiments is to provide additional
evidence on the role of labels in promoting comparison
and/or redescription in children’s relational learning. To do
this, we did not use linguistic labels since they may
implicate both comparison and replacement. Instead we
sought a form of “label” that could be manipulated in ways
to directly promote comparison versus redescription. In this          Figure 2: Training conditions for Experiments 1 and 2. The
