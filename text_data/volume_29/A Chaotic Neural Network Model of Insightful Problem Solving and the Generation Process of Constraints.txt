Arrow group, (t(22) = 3.97, p = 0.0007 > 0.01).
  In order to examine the changes in the frequency of filling
the notch, all participants' trials for each group was divided
into 4 sections in the time series, and the average of the
frequency of filling the notch in each section was plotted
(Figure 5). In the case of the Arrow-T group, the frequency
of filling the notch in the Arrow-puzzle was approximately
0.55 in all sections. In the case of the T-Arrow group, the
frequency was approximately 0.2 in t1 ~ t3, and it rapidly
increased to 0.61 in t4.
  For the Arrow-puzzle, the frequency change of filling the
notch was examined by the analysis of variance, by
considering the "Within factor" section and the "Between                       Figure 5: Result of experiment for Arrow-puzzle

section, group, and their interaction. For the effect of group,
F(1,27) = 15.716, p < .001; for the effect of section, F(3,81)
= 7.894, p < .001; and for the interaction effect, F(3,81) =
3.224, p < .05. This result shows that the change of the
frequency of filling the notch was affected by the experience
of solving the T-puzzle.
  For solving the T-puzzle, the average time to obtain the
solution was 972.73 s for T-Arrow group and 849.85s for
Arrow-T group, and thus no significant difference was
observed between the groups. The average trials count to
solution was 69.47 for the T-Arrow group and 81.0 for the
Arrow-T group, and no significant difference was observed
between the groups. The average of frequency of filling the                    Figure 6: Result of experiment for T-puzzle
