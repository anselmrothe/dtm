Abstract
The author proposes and investigates different strategies for
testing descriptive and prescriptive conditionals in Wason’s
selection tasks. Two experiments examined the influence of
frequency information on the postulated Bayesian and deontic
test strategies. The rules in both the descriptive and the prescriptive case were social rules. The results of Experiment 1
showed only some of the predicted differences, and necessitated an extension of the advocated dichotomy. Based on
this modification, Experiment 2 completely supported the predicted two types of test strategies. The discussion suggests a
classification of different frequency effects that may be
rational even for testing deontic rules.

Introduction
The philosophical distinction of ‘is’ and ‘ought’ is even
older than Aristotelian logic and although philosophers
agree to disagree about the relation of these two realms it
remained fundamental throughout history. It is argued here
that this distinction may fruitfully be applied to the
psychology of information selection and, particularly, to the
intensively investigated selection task, which has become
notorious for raising fundamental doubts over human
rationality.
The Wason Selection Task (WST; Wason, 1966) is
concerned with information-selection, particularly in testing
the hypothesis of a conditional of the form of “if p then q”.
Participants are requested to test a conditional (the theoretical world), for instance “if Ken eats haddock then he drinks
gin”, against an empirical world made up of four cards.
Each card represents a case and, in this example, one side of
a card represents some main dish (corresponding either to p
or non-p) and the other side represents a drink (either q or
non-q). The four visible card-sides stand for the four logical
classes, p (‘haddock’), non-p (‘salmon’), q (‘gin’), and nonq (‘vodka’). The participants’ task is to select the card(s)
that they need to turn over in order to test the rule.
In psychology, the traditional yardstick against which the
performance in the WST is measured has been the logicalfalsificationist norm of testing hypotheses. Accordingly, the
tested conditional has normally been interpreted as a deterministic relation in the sense of an implication: ∀x p(x) →
q(x). Independent of its content it is demanded that the two
potentially falsifying cards, p and non-q, are always to be
selected (here ‘haddock’ & ‘vodka’).
In four decades of intensive research on the WST,
particularly two anomalies of the falsificationist-logicist

research program have inspired the rise of a variety of
domain-general and domain-specific psychological theories.
The first anomaly has been that participants almost never
acted in accordance with the falsificationist norm, but generally seemed to select confirming evidence instead.
Already Johnson-Laird and Wason (1970) showed that, in
abstract selection tasks, 96% of their participants selected a
wrong pattern of cards, many choosing a p-and-q-pattern
instead. The second anomaly is linked to content effects, the
phenomenon that only particular contents ‘improves’ the
performance. In the test of the haddock-gin rule there was
no enhanced performance, despite its realistic content.
However, an improvement was found for the rule “If a
person is drinking beer, then the person must be of full age”.
Mental model theory (MM theory) explained both anomalies in a domain-general way, by either complete or incomplete representations of the conditional or biconditional
(Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 1991, 2002). Later a Bayesian
approach of rational hypothesis testing (Oaksford & Chater,
1994, 2003, von Sydow, 2006; see below) proposed an
alternative explanation for the first anomaly of the falsificationist norm, the confirmation bias. The second anomaly led
to the formulation of two further domain specific theories
concerned with obligations or social contracts. Pragmatic
reasoning schema theory (PRS theory) argued that testing a
conditional is not linked to a system of rational reasoning,
like formal logic, but to domain specific schemata (e.g.,
Cheng & Holyoak, 1985). They investigated an obligation
schema and a permission schema and found that the former
‘facilitates’ logical p and non-q answers but the latter elicits
clear-cut reversed patterns (non-p and q). Social contract
theory (SC theory) similarly showed that in social contracts
with a cheater detection goal either clear-cut p & non-q or
non-p & q patterns could be found, depending on the perspective of the tester (Cosmides & Tooby, 1992; Gigerenzer
& Hug, 1992, cf. Fiddick, 2004).

Testing Descriptive Hypotheses
and Checking Prescriptive Rules
In the WST debate, Manktelow and Over (1991) first noted
a normative difference of testing prescriptive and descriptive conditionals, since only the former cannot be falsified.
Nonetheless, previous research has not addressed the normative differences between testing prescriptive and descriptive rules. In a context in which frequency information
is varied, it will here be tested for the first time whether tests
of descriptive or prescriptive conditionals lead to different
typical test strategies. (This idea was suggested earlier in

1611

von Sydow, Metzner, Hagmayer, & Waldmann, 2005, cf.
von Sydow & Hagmayer, 2006.)
The distinction of ‘is’ and ‘ought’ has been fundamental
to most cultures and religions, and throughout history it has
been mirrored by basic philosophical dichotomies such as
ontology and ethics, or theoretical and practical philosophy.
Descriptive rules describe states of the world (i.e., facts) and
can therefore be true or false. In contrast, prescriptive rules
state what should be done or omitted. They often state what
is right or wrong. Representations about what is true or false
(traditionally truth tables) have to be distinguished from
representations about what is right or wrong (for ‘ought
tables’, cf. von Sydow et al., 2006).
It is advocated here that these two types of rules, tested in
WSTs, do not only have different meanings, but that they
are normally tested by using different test strategies. Although content effects in the WST have been observed particularly for prescriptive rules, only few researchers have recognized the importance of rational differences between
testing prescriptive and descriptive rules (without testing it
directly Oaksford & Chater, 1994, made a similar distinction; cf. v. Sydow, 2006). It is argued here that descriptive
conditionals should be tested according to Bayesian norms
of achieving maximal information gain, which determines
the informativity of certain cells of a truth table mainly a
posteriori, whereas the testing of prescriptive rules is typically concerned with an a priori focus on specific cells of
an ‘ought table’.
The Bayesian norm of testing descriptive rules (Oaksford
& Chater, 1994, 2003; von Sydow, 2004, 2006, cf. e.g.,
Evans & Over, 2004) takes not only the logical form into
consideration but frequency information as well. In Table 1
the basic model of a dependence hypothesis (the validity of
the implication) and an independence hypothesis (independence of p and q) is formulated based on fixed resulting
probabilities of P(pres) and P(qres).
Table 1: Dependence (a) and Independence (b) Model of a
Conditional with Fixed Marginal Probabilities (v. Sydow,
2002, cf. 2006; Hattori, 2002, Oaksford & Chater, 2003)

the additional prediction can be derived that for atomic propositions with a high probability (0.5 < P(p) ≤ P(q)) non-p
and non-q selections should increase. Despite the theoretical
appeal of this rational Bayesian resolution of the first anomaly, the empirical results have remained problematic
(Oberauer, Weidenfeld, & Hörnig, 2004, Oaksford &
Wakefield, 2003). Von Sydow (2006) gave an overview of
the diverse empirical findings and argued that the problematic results may be due to not establishing the exact preconditions of the model. Based on modifications in the
experimental procedure, first support could be provided for
different Bayesian models (cf. v. Sydow, 2004).
Whereas descriptive Bayesian models are concerned with
the truth or falsity of a conditional, prescriptive conditionals
are primarily concerned with what ought to be done or to be
omitted. The current investigations are based on the theory
that the clear-cut logical or illogical selection patterns, p &
non-q and non-p & q (second anomaly), shown by PRS and
SC theory, could be explained by a more general flexible
deontic logic theory (FDL theory, v. Sydow et al. 2006, v.
Sydow, 2006), which has provided novel findings:
Firstly, the clear-cut selection patterns found earlier for
obligation and permission schemas (cf. Manktelow & Over,
1995) were understood based on deontic logic as only two
out of four possible types of 2 × 2 ought tables for conditionals with one forbidden cell (in other contexts cf. Beller,
2003, Bucciarelli & Johnson-Laird, 2005). In an experiment,
all the predicted p & q, p & non-q, non-p & q, non-p & nonq selection patterns were found, corroborating that the (conditional) permission and obligation schemas are only special
cases of a more general system of schemas corresponding to
traditional deontic logic, including conditional prohibitions.
Secondly, this more complete deontic logic was additionally combined with the variation of the goals when checking
the rule (cf. Sperber & Girotto, 2002), eliciting different foci
on cheater or cooperator cases of different ought tables (cf.
Table 2 for a conditional obligation)
Table 2: Prescriptive Conditional Obligation Rule “If One is
a Bachelor One Must Abduct a Virgin” with a Cooperator
(Full Circle) or a Cheater Focus (Dotted Circle).
Does abduct
Does not abduct
virgin (q)
virgin (non-q)
Bachelor (p)
Allowed
Forbidden
Husband (non-p)
Allowed
Allowed

If this basic model is combined with further Bayesian
calculations (here exactly following Oaksford and Chater,
1994, cf. Sydow, 2006) more p than non-p selections and
more q than non-q selections are predicted, as long as one is
concerned with standard situations (P(p) ≤ P(q) < 0.5,
P(HD) = 1 – P(HI) = 0.5). This corresponds to the first
anomaly of frequent confirmatory p and q findings in descriptive WSTs if rarity is given. However, from this model

Von Sydow and colleagues for the first time showed
rational interactions of different deontic rules and different
goals. Moreover, a double focus condition showed a significant increase of predicted p, q, and non-q patterns. For
deontic rules this pattern has not been observed before and
comparisons with other patterns made clear that a cooperator focus differs from a mere absence of a cheater
focus. It was argued that the focus effects on different ought
tables cannot be explained by SC theory, PRS theory or

1612

MM theory – without adopting a deontic logic combined
with a flexible focus as postulated by FDL theory.
In this paper, we are concerned with another prediction of
FDL theory, which is only linked to the mentioned focus
effects. The typical task of a tester of a prescriptive rule – as
normally formulated in the WST tradition – is to search, for
instance, for cheaters only. In this sense, we are quite
literally concerned with a ‘selection task’. The standard instruction of testing prescriptive rules has been to ‘select all
cheaters’ (particularly in the tasks of Cosmides & Tooby,
1992). A construction of an analogous task for the testing of
descriptive rules would result in the rather unusual
instruction to ‘collect all cases where the conjunction p and
non-q occurred’ (cf. Wason, 1968; Sperber & Girotto,
2002). Although the ability to focus on different cells of a
truth table or an ought table may well be based on a general
rational process (Sperber & Girotto, 2002), and there may
be mechanisms common to the testing of both kinds of
rules, there are differences in how descriptive and
prescriptive rules are to be tested in standard contexts.
Here it is argued that given an a priori focus for instance
on cheaters in a prescriptive task there should not be the
frequency effects as predicted for standard descriptive tasks.
For standard prescriptive tasks with an a priori focus, FDL
theory predicts not the same frequency effects as it is predicted for descriptive tasks. The postulated difference of
these two task types, will here be investigated for the first
time with respect to potential frequency effects. However,
please note, a complete absence thereof is not necessary in
prescriptive tasks. Firstly, from a Bayesian perspective,
within-focus frequency effects would be rational also for
prescriptive rules with a priori focus. But they should only
affect cards that refer to the focused forbidden case of a conditional obligation (p versus non-q; cf. Kirby, 1994).
Secondly, frequency information should be irrelevant for
standard prescriptive WSTs, but there may be tasks in which
probability determines which cells are to be focused on in
the first place (goal frequency effects and sorting frequency
effects). But these probability effects should not lead to the p
vs. non-p-effects predicted for descriptive tasks (cf. General
Discussion). If such effects are excluded, frequency effects
should be present in testing standard descriptive rules but
absent in testing standard prescriptive rules.
The distinction may, for instance, explain why Cosmides
(1989, Exp. 1, 2; cf. Gigerenzer & Hug, 1992, Exp. 1) found
a difference between conditions in which an anthropologist
tested for the truth or falsity of a social rule and cheater
detection conditions in which participants were concerned
with detecting cheaters. This difference does not need to
point to a cheater detection module, but it may point to
rational ways to solve two quite different kinds of tasks.
However, the postulated differential effect of frequency
sensitivity on descriptive and prescriptive WSTs has not yet
been tested directly and simultaneously. This is carried out
in the following two experiments.

Experiment 1
Method
Design and Participants The experiment had a
2 (prescriptive vs. descriptive task) × 2 (low vs. high probability) between-subjects design. 80 participants of the
University of Göttingen (56 % female, 44 % male) finished
the task (cf. v. Sydow, 2006).
Materials and Procedure The tasks were carried out in
paper and pencil tests on the campus. The instructions were
given in German. The prescriptive and the descriptive
conditions varied in the beginning and at the end of the instructions, the middle section was identical.
In the prescriptive task conditions, it was stated that the
participants should imagine they were members of a council
of elders of a tribe, who had a police function, and whose
task it was to punish those who had violated the law. In the
descriptive task conditions, participants should imagine that
they were an ethnologist investigating a tribe’s social rules.
The descriptive rule read, “If someone is a bachelor, then
he brings fish to the medicine man” and in the descriptive
rule only the modal verb ‘must’ was added: “If someone is a
bachelor, then he must bring fish to the medicine man.” In
the descriptive conditions, the alternative hypothesis was
clarified, the marital status and acts of bringing fish appear
together in a completely random way (cf. v. Sydow, 2006).
In all conditions, it was explained that there is a two-sided
panel for each male member of the tribe. On one side of
each panel, it is said whether the person is a bachelor or
husband (mentioning the symbols used later). On the other
side of the same panel whether the tribe member brought
fish or not was registered (symbols). The instruction continued such that the chief of that tribe shows the participant
all fronts of all panels (this corresponds to P(bachelors) and
P(husbands)). After mixing the panels, he then showed all
the backs of the cards (P(fish) and P(non-fish)).
There was a high and a low frequency condition in both
task types. In all conditions, 20 panels were considered, and
hence 20 fronts and 20 backs were shown. The probabilities
for the antecedent (‘bachelor’) and for the consequent
(‘brings fish’) were ‘0.10 → 0.15’ in the low probability
conditions and ‘0.85 → 0.90’ in the high probability conditions. This actively introduced the preconditions of a model
with fixed marginals (cf. v. Sydow, 2002, 2004, 2006). It
was emphasized that the panels were mixed between the
displays of the fronts and the backs, and hence the mapping
of the individual sides of the panels is still unknown.
The participants then had to imagine that the chief of the
tribe allows them to turn over only two cards separately.
The participants were then required to tick those cards,
which they would turn over to fulfil their task. They could
tick one card to be turned over out of the first display
(‘bachelor’ or ‘husband’) and another out of the second
display (‘fish’ or ‘non-fish’).

Results
The results are reported in Table 3. Comparing the high and
low probability conditions in descriptive tasks, both the
predicted significant increase of non-p vs. p selections was
found (Pearson χ2(1) = 9.23, p < .01) and the increase of nonq vs. q selections was found (Pearson χ2(1) = 6.46, p < .05).
In contrast, in the prescriptive tasks it was confirmed that
there are no p vs. non-p frequency effects in the low vs. high
probability condition (exact Fisher test: p = .70). However,
deviating form the original predictions a frequency effect
still occurred with regard to the q vs. non-q selections
(Pearson χ2(1) = 5.01, p < .05).

conditions the titles “Testing of Hypotheses” and “Punishment of Rule Violators” was added. Secondly, in the prescriptive conditions it was mentioned that a reward for
adhering to the law is not intended and the cheater detection
goal was emphasized. Thirdly, it was aimed to prevent the
strategy of sorting out the cooperators by emphasizing that
the selected cheaters should directly be punished.

Based on the comments of the participants of Experiment 1
it was assumed that the remaining q vs. non-q frequency
effect in the prescriptive task conditions might be based on a
reinterpretation of the detection goal (goal frequency effect)
or based on the trial to identify all cooperators in order to
punish the few remaining cheaters later (sorting effect).
These effects would make sense of the otherwise useless
frequency information. These kinds of frequency effects
would produce exactly the q versus non-q and no p versus
non-p effects, which were found in the prescriptive tasks. In
Experiment 2, it was aimed to exclude these effects, by
eliciting an a priori focus more clearly and by excluding the
possibility of a sorting strategy (cf. General Discussion).

Another 80 participants from the University of Göttingen
(51 % male, 49 % female) correctly finished the task.
Materials and Procedure In most aspects Experiment 2
replicated Experiment 1. Only the following details differed
in order to exclude the above mentioned strategies with an a
posteriori focus. Firstly, in the descriptive and prescriptive

For the descriptive tasks the predicted frequency effects
found in Experiment 1 were replicated. In the high versus
low probability condition there was a increase in the portion
of non-q versus q selections (Pearson test: χ2(1) = 6.47, ponetailed < .01) and an increase in the portion of non-p versus p
selections (Pearson test: χ2(1) = 3.96, p < .05). In contrast, for
the prescriptive task conditions now no difference was
found between the low and high probability conditions neither for the p versus non-p choice (exact Fisher test: p = .70)
nor for the q versus non-q choice (Fisher test: p = 1.00).

1614

General Discussion
The results of Experiment 2 and also of Experiment 1
corroborate the existence of different test strategies for the
standard testing of descriptive and prescriptive conditionals
under conditions in which frequency information is provided
(cf. v. Sydow et al. 2006, v. Sydow, 2006). I shall argue
subsequently that Experiment 1 additionally suggests a more
intricate relation between test strategies of descriptive and
prescriptive WSTs than originally assumed.
Furthermore, the frequency effects found for the descriptive
social rules are interesting in their own right. Firstly, the
results for the first time show for social rules both predicted p
versus non-p and q versus non-q frequency effects. This
confirms that the p and q patterns found in the anthropologist
conditions of Cosmides (Cosmides 1989; cf. Cosmides &
Tooby, 1992) need not be interpreted as irrational but appear
to correspond to a Bayesian strategy. Secondly, due to
previous problems to achieve these two effects
simultaneously, Oxford and Wakefield (2003) argued that
these effects seem to occur only when “participants sample
the data naturally, i.e. sequentially”, as in their experiment.
Oberauer, Weidenfeld, and Hörnig (2004) pointed out a
problematic confounding factor in that experiment and
themselves provided evidence against the Bayesian
predictions. Based on the idea that more positive results may
be achieved, if the mathematical preconditions of the models
are introduced in detail (e. g. fixed marginals, cf. v. Sydow,
2004, 2006), it was shown here that one may achieve both
frequency effects even without sequential tests.
To my knowledge, there are no previous experiments on
the effects of frequency information on both descriptive and
prescriptive (social) WSTs. Love and Kessler (1995, Exp. 1b)
tested both types of rules, but varied only the plausibility of
counterexamples, not the probabilities P(p) and P(q). In
deontic tasks the number of visible cards was varied by
Manktelow, Sutherland and Over (1995) and Kirby (1994,
Exp. 4), but both were concerned only with p versus non-q
selections (within-focus effects) and utility manipulations, not
with probability effects.
In Experiments 1 and 2, two different contrasts resulted. In
Experiment 1 with a weak a priori focus the p versus non-p
frequency effect disappeared in the prescriptive conditions,
but – in contrast to the descriptive conditions – there was still
a q versus non-q effect. In Experiment 2, with a clearer
a priori focus, both frequency effects disappeared in the
prescriptive task conditions.
The results of Experiment 1 were not originally predicted,
since formally an a priori focus was used. However, the
results could readily be explained by the specific frequency
effects for prescriptive WSTs mentioned that are predicted by
FDL theory (cf. v. Sydow, 2006, for details): Beside the p
versus non-q within-focus effects, which cannot be relevant
here (due to the limited selection options), there can be
rational goal frequency effects and sorting frequency effects
also for prescriptive rules.
Firstly, frequency information may have an effect on
changing the goal of the task itself. Ceteris paribus, the goal

to punish cheaters is plausible if a rule is followed by most
people, whereas the goal to reward cooperators may gain
plausibility if the rule is normally violated (cf. v. Sydow, et al.
2006, v. Sydow, 2006). In the high frequency condition the
minimum possible number of cooperators is here higher than
their maximal number in the low frequency condition. Hence,
in the low probability condition the goal to reward the few
cooperators (q selections) and in the high probability
condition the goal to punish the few cheaters (non-q
selections) may reasonably gain plausibility. Written remarks
of some participants confirmed this interpretation. However,
this kind of frequency effect for prescriptive WSTs should
only be relevant for bachelors (p) leading only to q versus
non-q effects – as found in Experiment 1.
Secondly, even if one realizes an a priori focus on the
forbidden case p & non-q, one may try to sort out the few
possible cooperator cases in the low probability condition
(q selections), exactly in order to efficiently punish the remaining cheaters. Again, p versus non-p choices should be
unaffected, since independent of whether one tries to sort out
cheaters (non-q) or cooperators (q), one always aims to check
for bachelors (p). This corresponds to the results of
Experiment 1. However, sorting effects are only rational if
there is a limited universe of discourse and further selections
are deemed possible in the future. To exclude this possibility
in Experiment 2, it was stressed that no further cards could be
selected later on and that one directly aims to punish deviant
behavior.
Thus, the contrast between descriptive and prescriptive
tasks in Experiment 1 is in line with the claim that different
mechanisms were in play in the two kinds of tasks, which is
consistent with FDL theory. Moreover, after excluding the
discussed factors in Experiment 2, both frequency effects
disappeared.
In conclusion, it is wrong to assume that there is only one
test strategy for both the standard tests of descriptive and
prescriptive rules (cf. v. Sydow, 2004, 2006). With regard to
frequency information, there are different selection patterns,
which need not be irrational, but which seem to be in line
with different rational strategies to test descriptive and
prescriptive rules.
Most other theories are either inconsistent with the findings
or could explain the results only with substantial extensions.
PRS theory (Cheng & Holyoak, 1985) inspired the current
investigation and would have predicted the p and non-q
pattern in the prescriptive condition of Experiment 2, but it
could explain neither the frequency effects in the descriptive
social tasks nor the partial frequency effect in the prescriptive
social task of Experiment 1. Likewise, SC theory (Cosmides
& Tooby, 1992, Gigerenzer & Hug, 1992) cannot explain the
frequency effects. Moreover, SC theory claimed that an
activation of cheater detection is needed in social contract
situations to achieve reliable deviations from normal p versus
q selections. However, here novel non-p and non-q selection
patterns were predicted and found. Relevance theory
(Sperber, et al., 1995; Sperber & Girotto, 2002) also cannot
positively account for the reported findings. Although the

1615

formulation of FDL theory owes something to Sperber and
Girotto (2002, cf. von Sydow et al., 2006, v. Sydow, 2006),
relevance theory, framed in terms of cognitive effect and
effort, does not have any immediate predictions for purely
probabilistic manipulations. Finally, MM theory (JohnsonLaird & Byrne, 1991, 2002) has remained a domain-general
theory. Moreover, the explanatory mechanism of MM theory
is based on complete versus incomplete representations, not
on different test strategies. Particularly, it does not provide
any clear predictions for the frequency effects. (According to
MM theory there could even be opposed mappings between
the theoretically relevant salience of a counterexample and
different frequencies, cf. Oaksford & Chater, 1994, v. Sydow,
2006.) Manktelow and Over (1991, 1995) were the first to
point out the difference in the result of testing prescriptive
and descriptive rules, and I owe much to this distinction.
Although the decision theoretic accounts of the WST
(e.g., Manktelow & Over, 1991, 1995; cf. Evans & Over,
2004) have generally not predicted any particular differences
in test strategies for prescriptive or descriptive rules, the
investigated distinction is in my view not in principle at odds
with an extended decision theoretic approach. Particularly,
Oaksford and Chater (1994, cf. 2003) have pre-empted some
aspects of the dichotomy investigated here. For prescriptive
rules, they advocated a decision theoretic approach with
weights for different cells and contrasted this to their
Bayesian approach for descriptive tasks. Nevertheless, they
have neither explicitly made particular predictions for contrasts between these kinds of rules, nor tested the dissociation
supported here.
The current paper contributes to the idea that there are more
than one rational test strategies and frequency effects for
testing prescriptive and descriptive rules (cf. also v. Sydow,
2004). Here it was shown for the first time with frequency
information that standard tests of prescriptive or descriptive
social rules may elicit different test strategies and different
corresponding selection patterns.
