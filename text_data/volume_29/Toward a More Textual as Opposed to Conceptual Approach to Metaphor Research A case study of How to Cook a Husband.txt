consist of a cross-domain mapping from a source domain
onto a target domain, because it does not account for the sense
conﬂicts such as that between the sense of tender to describe
the quality of husband (or man in general) and the sense of
tender to describe the quality of meat. It should be noted that
this kind of sense conﬂicts are not evident (or very weak if
ever noticed) in conventional metaphors: that is, they are not
fully conventionalized in the true sense of the term, suggesting that the conﬂicts are not fully suppressed.
It appears that CBT has overcome this kind of problem, at
least apparently. Unlike CMT, CBT does not assume a mapping from a source to a target in an explicit form. Instead, it
treats mappings as a side effect of blending. CBT has a problem of its own, however. An additional assumption must be
made to account for the distinction between inputs that serve
as the source and target, respectively. In (1), readers should
have a feeling that husbands are treated like ingredients, but
why is there no feeling that ingredients are treated like husbands? And is this a side effect of blending, or is it a precondition? This is not clear in CBT. Thus, the most serious
problem with CBT is that it fails to account for why conventional metaphors do not show the sense conﬂict we observe
in creative metaphors. It is tautological to explain that this is
because they are conventionalized.
Both accounts of CMT and CBT have the following more
serious limitations: it is not clear how conceptual domains
or inputs are associated with particular linguistic expressions, which are not always words. It is not given in CMT
and CBT how a conceptual domain or input is triggered or
evoked. It is not clear, either, exactly what structures need
to be assumed for conceptual domains or inputs. In short,
the problem of, and procedure for, metaphor recognition/
identiﬁcation is completely overlooked in CMT and CBT.
Without this procedure, we cannot tell whether or not a given
expression is metaphorical, and if so, to what degree.4) This
paper outlines a textually oriented theory that deals with this
problem. We assume several things such as the following:

problems that need to be solved in metaphor research.

Identifying metaphor dynamically
Method
Under the working title of differential approach, we will compare two texts with minimal lexical differences. One is a
metaphorical text presented in (1), How to cook a husband, a
relatively well-known joke. The other is the text presented in
(3), How to cook a X, which we created by replacing all the
words and phrases that trigger metaphorical interpretations
with words and phrases that do not trigger such interpretations. The differences are indicated in boldface.
(3) A good many Xs (e.g., chickens) are utterly spoiled by misman-

(2) (i) A text/talk consists of phrases, or collocations, that
evoke certain concrete situations (e.g., h Cooking a food i,
h Buying ingredients i) independently of each other; (ii)
Reading/hearing the phrases in sequential order results in
a series of evocations of situations [S1 , . . . , Sn ]; (iii) Nothing special takes place if S1 , . . . , Sn are integrated without problems, but some adjustments must be made when
problems like semantic mismatches between Si and S j (for
source and target) arise in the integration process (in terms
of, say, violations of selectional restrictions). Metaphors,
at least novel ones, result from the recovery process caused
by such problems. (iv) The recovery is achieved by implicit
introduction of some super-ordinate concept/category S∗ .
Recognition of S∗ often gives rise to certain rhetorical effects like the aha experience.
We conclude the paper by specifying a set of empirical

agement in cooking and so are not tender and good. Some women
keep them constantly in hot water; others let them freeze by their
carelessness and indifference. Some keep them in a stew with
irritating ways and Y (e.g., manners). Some wives keep them
pickled, while others waste them shamefully. It cannot be supposed that any X (e.g., chicken) will be tender and good when so
managed, but they are really delicious when prepared properly.
In selecting an X (e.g., chicken), you should not be guided by the
silvery appearance as in buying a mackerel; nor by the golden tint
as if you wanted salmon. Do not go to the market for X# (e.g., it)
as the best ones are always brought to the door. Be sure to select
X# (e.g., it) yourself as tastes differ. It is far better to have none
unless you will patiently learn how to cook X# (e.g., it). Like
crabs and lobsters, Xs (e.g., chickens) are cooked alive. Make a
clear, steady ﬂame of Y (e.g., ﬁre). Set X# (e.g., it) as near this
as seems to agree with X# (e.g., it). If X# (e.g., it) sputters, do
not be anxious, for some Xs (e.g., chickens) do this until they are
quite done. Add a little sugar in the form of what confectioners
call Y (e.g., magic powder); use no pepper or vinegar on any account. Season to taste with spices, good Y (e.g., white wine and
lemon) preferred, but seasoning must always be used with great
discretion and caution. Avoid sharpness in testing X# (e.g., it)
for tenderness. Stir X# (e.g., it) gently. You cannot fail to know
when X# (e.g., it) is done. If so treated, you will ﬁnd X# (e.g.,
it) very digestible, agreeing with you perfectly; and X# (e.g., it)
will keep as long as you choose unless you become careless and
allow the Y (e.g., refrigerator) to grow Y (e.g., too warm). Thus
prepared, X# (e.g., it) will serve a Y (e.g., long) -time of Y (e.g.,
satisfaction).

X identiﬁes an ingredient, X# a pronominal reference to X,
and each occurrence of Y is a co-variable of X.

The Problem
Comparing the texts in (1) and (3) , it is easy to notice that
surface-true differences in words and phrases in boldface between (1) and (3) are relatively few. The details of the 31 lexical differences are the following: husband is replaced with
a variable X (e.g., chicken) (5 places). he, his and him are
replaced with X# (e.g., it, its and it) (12 places) nouns and
adjectives inappropriate to describe foodstuffs (e.g., humor)
are replaced with a variable Y with appropriate lexical items
(e.g., white wine) or removed (e.g., cheerfulness) (14 places).
Both (1) and (3) consist of 298 words. There are only 31
different words between them. This is only 10.4% (= 31/298)
of the text, not a big number. Furthermore, out of the 31 differences, ten are pronominal words and 21 are content words.
There are not many content words. Nevertheless, these small
differences are enough to make the text in (1) metaphorical.

Figure 2: States 1 to 6 in the PMA parse of (5) in Phase 1

Identifying relevant “syntax of words”
Let us brieﬂy examine the lexical information that encodes
the syntax relevant to the “co-compositioinal” process with
the example in (5). To this aim, we use (Parallel) Pattern
Matching Analysis (PMA) (Kuroda, 2000).

Identifying potential texts
The intuition that guided us to our approach is the following:
(4) Most, if not all, poetic effects attributed to the metaphor,
or set of metaphors, relevant to the text in (1) come from a
small number of violations in the proper terminology (e.g.,
collocations like Some Xs do this until they are quite done,
Stir X gently) that normally constitute a recipe.

(5) Some women keep them constantly in hot water.

This suggests that the reader of (1) does a “dual” reading
in that he or she reads a potential text in (3) while reading the
real text in (1), where husband is understood as a deviant instance of X. Based on a linguistic analysis, we argue that the
understanding of the text in (1) requires a network illustrated
in Fig. 1. Note that identiﬁcation of R as a template is not
sufﬁcient to account for the metaphoric effect. R*, a superschema/template for recipe R and non-recipes, is necessary.
For this, note that (1) is not a proper instance of a recipe template/schema R, which is characterized in (3). Rather, it is an
instance of the implicit R*. Importantly, introduction of R*
requires an ad hoc abstraction of R and a generalization of
it into R*. For reasons speciﬁed later, this process must be as
much conservative as possible to avoid overgeneralizations.
Basically, the aha experience comes, at least in part, from the
unexpected discovery of R* that follows the understanding of
(1). In the next section, we will show how to guarantee that
the text in (1) is not a proper instance of R.
1201

Figure 2 illustrates how the PMA parse of (5) goes, showing its incremental, word-wise updates over the “pattern matrix” M (of seven rows and seven columns, because we hypothesized that (5) consists of seven segments (= words, in
this case).The ﬁnal state in Fig 2 corresponds to the Result of
Phase 1 in Fig 3. Some important details in Fig 2 are to be
explained, but we will be very brief due to space limitations.
Phase 1 This phase prepares the initial phase shown in
Fig 3. Each row of the matrix M characterizes “lexical, distributed syntax” in that each segment of a sentence undergoes
a context-sensitive representation, which we call a “subpattern.” A subpattern pi for word wi is encoded as a sequence
of variables DET, SUBJ, OBJ, VERB, PREP. It identiﬁes the
(hypothetically abstracted) co-occurrence pattern of w. For
example, keep is represented as a subpattern “SUBJ . . . keep*
. . . OBJ . . . (COMP),” where “SUBJ” and “OBJ” encode subject and object NPs, and “COMP” encodes a complement
of a particular kind.5) The lexical “head” of a subpattern is
marked with “*”. This means that keep is a word that is preceded by a subject NP, followed by an object NP, and option5) X[i,

j] indicates that it is the ith part of X of j parts.

ally followed by a complement.6) Variables like SUBJ, OBJ
are not merely syntactic variables to specify syntactic functions/categories. Rather, they are “lexicalized” for a particular head segment. For example, OBJ in “SUBJ kill* OBJ” (=
“S kill O”) needs a semantic speciﬁcation [+animate]. This
is a very simple example, but all variables of a subpattern
have (often complex) semantic speciﬁcations at an appropriate granularity. In this way, the ith row in the matrix M encode
the lexical syntax of ith segment, but the state of M updates
segment-wise and the syntactic speciﬁcation for the subpatterns recognized later may (and usually do) alter the speciﬁcation of the previous ones.
Incremental parse is not the only interpretation of how
PMA goes. We can think of a PMA parse as an optimization process in which all segments are assigned subpatterns
simultaneously and completely in parallel. If this interpretation is adopted, we may think that the result of Phase 1 is
given all at once. This discards the state-wise development
diagrammed in Fig 2.
Given a pattern matrix M, pattern compositions over M
are interpreted as column-wise uniﬁcations with and without
overrides.7) The uniﬁcation process is often called “superposition” of subpatterns in the following sense: given two
subpatterns, p1 = “The dog V ” and p2 = “S bites (O).” They
unify to produce p0 = “The dog bites” if and only if (i) the
semantics of “the dog” of p1 and of S of p2 unify, (ii) the
semantics of V of p1 and of “bites” unify, and (ii) the semantics of NULL string8) of p1 and of (O) of p2 unify. A
pattern composition/superposition ends without overrides if
all subpatterns are uniﬁed without meeting incompatiblities;
otherwise, uniﬁcation requires overrides of one speciﬁcation
over another. Metaphor and metonymy are good examples of
pattern composition with overrides.
Phase 2 This phase consists of complex, collocational patterns that are coupled with semantic struc6) Obviously, the possible form of subpattern needs to be constrained. An important constraint is that all subpatterns meet the
“surface-true” generalizations.
7) Most overrides are semantic ones, but there are certain cases in
which they result in a phonological/phonetic modiﬁcation.
8) Simply, a null string is assumed to have an arbitray semantics.

Figure 4: Elements of F, G, and H match segments of composite patterns q1, q2, and p5 via parallel pattern recognition

tures/conceptualization patterns that are identiﬁed in terms of
“(semantic) frames” in the sense of Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1985) and the Berkeley FrameNet (BFN) (Fontenelle,
2003; Ruppenhofer, Ellsworth, Petruck, & Johnson, 2005).
The way situations F, G, and H are associated with collocational patterns in Phase 2 is diagrammed in Fig. 4.9)
It is assumed in PMA that meanings are more strongly encoded by collocational patterns, elements of Phase 2, than
by lexical items, i.e., elements of Phase 1.10) For example,
q2 (= some women keep them in hot water), integration of
p1, p2, p3, p4, p7, and p8, evokes a scene of h Boiling i,
9) BFN has not started the description of what composite units
evoke. Some measures need to be taken to deal with such distributed
evocations. In our attempt, the correspondences between segments
and frame elements are speciﬁed with Multilayered Semantic Frame
Analysis (MSFA) (Kuroda & Isahara, 2005). While there is no space
to go into details in this paper, it needs a mention that word sense
disambiguation is better handled by MSFA than PMA.
10) Those patterns can be identiﬁed as “constructions” in the sense
of Construction Grammar (Goldberg, 1995).

which is an instance of h Apply heat* i of BFN,11) if them
is understood to refer to certain ingredients. By constrast,
q1 (= some women keep them COMP), integration of p1, p2,
p3, and p4, evokes a general wife-husband interaction like
[[some [women as h Wives i]] keep doing something to [them
as h Husbands i]] if them is understood to refer to husbands.
At the same time, word sense disambiguation (WSD) needs
to occur between Phases 1 and 2. Most verbs are polysemous,
and blending analysis would not work unless it came with a
proper mechanism for WSD. It should be noted that PMA,
by itself, does not carry out the WSD task: it is only useful
for speciﬁcation of units for sense description.12) Most importantly, it is very hard to identify meanings of collocational
units like “S keep O in hot/cold water” because their meanings are usually not reducible to lexical meanings. Searching
on the Internet, it is easy to see that “S keep O (constantly)
in hot water” is an established metaphor to mean “S torture
O,” whereas “S boil O in hot water” and “S keep O in cold
water” are not so, and are more likely to be found in recipes.
This is why we need superlexical speciﬁcations in Phase 2, as
detailed in Fig. 4, no matter how redudant they might seem.

Unlike the blending effects that occurred in Phase 2, blending of q1 and q2 requires semantic adjustments, because conceptualizations evoked by q1 and q2 are mutually incongruous. q2 expects OBJ to be an ingredient type, resulting in a
type mismatch with the semantic speciﬁcations for them, part
of q1, which refers to husbands. In the case of (1), we have
the resolution diagrammed in Fig 1, where the end product is
two-fold: (i) the recognition of the instantiation relation between super schema/template R* and the text in (1); and (ii)
the recognition of the description relation between R* and
h Careful management of family affairs i, as in Fig 1.
Note that it is hard to say that the sense of h Careful management of family affairs i in Fig 1 is either blended or cocomposed. It seems better to argue that a potential categorization between R* and R is discovered. We suggest that this
is a feature shared with analogies (Gentner, 1983; Holyoak
& Thagard, 1994) and differentiates creative metaphors from
conventional ones. We will return to this issue below.

Final Phase, and what is special about it? Identiﬁed collocations, q1 and q2, speciﬁed in Phase 2 do not unify: they
are in competition in that the situations they evoke are in conﬂict with each other. This mismatch can be resolved if the
sense of q2 is modiﬁed to match the semantics of q1, and this
is what we believe actually takes place. In this sense, what is
usually called metaphor, at least in this case, is a set of semantic adjustments to the semantics of a verb (or a verb phrase)
that shifts its sense so that it is compatible with the semantics
of the subject (and object).
In general, sense conﬂict between two subpatterns p1 and
p2 that evoke contradictory situations F and G, respectively,
is resolved in the form of metaphor in the following way:13)

CBT, like CMT, is more interested in explaining why such
and such interpretations are constructed against a speciﬁc
text, but its explanation is essentially post hoc, because it
does not show why the suggested interpretations cannot be
otherwise.14) To avoid the post hoc nature of explanation, we
need to be well informed of what words or phrases can (and
cannot) trigger what knowledge sources, before we try an explanation. Without this, any attempt to give a full account
for a metaphoric interpretation is post hoc. Explanations in
CMT and CBT are no exception. For one, the text in (1)
would not sound metaphorical unless readers already know
what “S keep O in hot water” and “S keep O in the refrigerator” mean. Most words are polysemous and a blending
analysis would not be revealing unless a proper mechanism
for sense disambiguation is provided. In CMT and CBT, it is
taken for granted how such knowledge sources are accessed
via linguistic units, U(T ) = u1 , u2 , . . . , un that comprise a text
T , but it is far from well-known exactly what the units really
are. Thus, any attempt to explain away by saying that access
to such knowledge sources are (part of) the meanings of u1 ,
u2 , . . . , un just begs the question. This is exactly what makes
accounts in CBT post hoc and why we need a structural analysis as provided in PMA.
Structural analysis is not enough, though. First, it is necessary to clarify the way collocational patterns comprise a
text. To this end, we need a database of collocational patterns with a good coverage. A serious problem with such a
database is how to describe such patterns. PMA is designed
to describe collocational patterns in terms of subpatterns, but
no serious effort has been made to provide a database of subpatterns in this framework. This is one of the limitations of
the framework. Second, we need to accumulate enough situations/semantic frames at appropriate granularity levels. A

(6) p1 serves as the source of metaphor if and only if F ∗ , an ad
hoc abstraction of F, is introduced as the superordinate
class for F and G, i.e., ¬ (F is-a G) & ¬ (G is-a F) &
F is-a F ∗ & G is-a F ∗ & ¬ F is-a G∗ . Alternatively, p2
serves as the source if and only if G∗ is introduced as the
superordinate class for F and G, i.e., ¬ (F is-a G) & ¬ (G
is-a F) & F is-a G∗ & G is-a G∗ & ¬ (G is-a F ∗ ).
This implies that metaphor is a by-product of semantic interaction, rather than a cause of semantic reinterpretation.
The blended space in the sense of CBT corresponds to X
described by s of Final Phase of Fig 3, but conceptual and
textual blends need to be distinguished. While X is a conceptual blend of G, F and H, s is a textual blend of q1, q2 and p5.
Despite this, for the sake of simplicity, we do not distinguish
textual blends from conceptual blends in the following.

key aspect that helps us explain them would be that the source
domain utilized in the metaphor is not simply h Cooking i in
general, but h Cooking for family by wife i as a h Housework i
performed by a h Housekeeper i, under the equation h Wife i
= h Housekeeper i. This means that implicit narrowing of the
general notion of h Cooking i is at work.
In the present study, as in CMT and CBT, situations/semantic frames are assumed in the post hoc fashion,
which makes our analysis post hoc, too. This is regrettable, but we still believe that our analysis deals with creative metaphors better than CMT and CBT. Clearly, a widecoverage database of knowledge sources could not be dispensed with to avoid the post hoc nature of analysis. A
database of conceptualizations being developed in BFN mentioned above, for one, should be useful.

Creative and conventional metaphors
Before concluding, let us turn brieﬂy to a general issue. (1)
illustrates a case of creative metaphor with poetic effects. It
is not a case of conventional metaphors in the sense of Lakoff
and Johson (1980). This is why we get the impression that
the text in (1) is a parody of a recipe. Thus, it is inadequate
to explain the metaphorical effects in (1) by saying that we
have the H USBAND IS AN I NGREDIENT metaphor in the style
of CMT. First of all, such metaphors need to be either invented or discovered when one reads the text, because they
are not conventional. The question is not what metaphor one
comes up with, but how one can invent or discover something for whatever metaphor. As previous studies (Coulson &
Matlock, 2001; Coulson & Van Petten, 2002; Noveck et al.,
2001) suggest, it takes more mental effort to interpret creative
metaphors than literal expressions. Furthermore, Blasko &
Connie (1993) report that children begin to interpret creative
metaphors later in life than conventional metaphors.
Given that metaphorical and literal meanings are constructed independently and in parallel, these experimental results would allow two possible explnations for conventional
metaphors: one possibility is that, in constrast with creative
metaphors, pattern integration in Phases 2 and 3 is half routinized in conventional metaphors. Another possibility is that
conventional metaphors have distinctive collocational patterns that bypass the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2,
achieving both meaning construction and WSD at the same
time. People may still detect poetic effects in the ﬁrst possibility, but it is unlikely that they do so in the second possibility. While no research has been done to differentiate the two
possibilities, they are unlikely to be mutually exclusive, given
the fact that different conventional metaphors have different
degrees of conventionality (Goatly, 1997).

Concluding remarks
PMA is not a standard analysis. We believe, however, that,
if coupled with BFN, it can be a useful tool to interface between collocational/textual structures and conceptual structures. The analysis of metaphor as we provided in this paper
is a demonstration of such an account. We hope that syntactic
1204

analysis such as PMA could make an important contribution
to metaphor research.
