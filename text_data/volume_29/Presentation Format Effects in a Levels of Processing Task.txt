Results and Discussion
Mean proportion of yes responses to the recognition test are
presented in Figure 1. To correct for guessing, mean
recognition scores were calculated by subtracting the
proportion of false alarms from the proportion of hits. A
repeated measures analysis was conducted separately on the
recognition scores and the confidence scale data. Since the
results of both analyses were the same, only the recognition
analysis is reported.
