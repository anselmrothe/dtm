Abstract
Despite the brief and discrete inputs the visual system receives from frequent sudden eye movements, we are able to
act smoothly and perceive the visual world as temporally and
spatially continuous. While the spatial part of this discrete-tocontinuous transformation has received considerable research
attention, the temporal part has only of late been given serious
consideration. That we know relatively little is evidenced by
the recent discovery that during a period around 50 ms before
an eye movement, a pair of flashed stimuli will be perceived
as having happened in the 'wrong' order (Morrone et al.,
2005). In this study we establish experimentally that unimodal auditory stimuli are not subject to this distortion and then
use an audio-visual temporal order judgment paradigm to determine why and how this illusion occurs. By examining
visual-system-caused changes to the multimodal point of subjective simultaneity we are able to discern how the processing
of a single visual stimulus is altered as a function of when
during eye movement generation the stimulus occurs. This research moves us closer to establishing a schedule of
perceptual distortions during eye movements, which may help
in answering questions of how perceptual continuity is maintained and serve to inspire and constrain computational
models of this aspect of visual processing.

Introduction
The stability and continuity of visual perception has puzzled
thinkers at least since Plato (Grusser, 1994), and a large and
productive research program has been organized around
solving the problem's spatial aspect – how it is that disparate
sources of information are knit into a coherent and useful
whole. But this knitting takes place in and over time, and
how we construct a temporally contiguous (or continuous)
perception of the world is a question that has received considerably less attention. While it is not obvious that this
issue is even logically coherent, this does not mean that it
should go uninvestigated, but instead that in researching it
we should concentrate on the seemingly obvious and the
obviously puzzling. The 'temporal inversion illusion' of
Morrone et al. (2005a) provides just such a problem, and in
this paper we propose to examine it by using a second sensory modality (audition) as a 'temporal landmark'.
One presumed self-evident characteristic of our perception of time is that it is one-way and one-dimensional. It
would thus be puzzling, to say the least, if we experienced

the world 'in the wrong order'. It has been found, however,
that exactly this takes place for two sufficiently brief and
rapid visual stimuli if they are perceived immediately prior
to making a saccade (the darting and ballistic eye movement
we perform a few times each second). Morrone et al.
(2005a) found that if both of two 8 ms flashes in different
locations in the visual field were presented between 70 and
30 ms (‘the inversion time window’) before a saccade they
would be consistently perceived as having happened in the
order opposite from the one in which they were presented.
The illusion was elicited by having subjects stare at a
fixation point (FP1) and perform an evoked saccade to a
second fixation point (FP2) 30 degrees to the right. Some
random period of time after FP2, two green bars nearequiluminant to a red background appeared in an unpredictable order. The subject was then to indicate which bar
appeared first. When the interval between the two bars was
less than 80 ms, and when they occurred around the inversion time window, subjects consistently reported perceiving
them in the ‘wrong’ order (Figure 1). These results are ambiguous with regard to possible explanations; observing the
effect on paired stimuli has made it difficult to discover
what has happened to the processing of the stimuli individually. We believed the illusion was caused by different
latencies of perception for stimuli at different stages of saccade preparation and we designed the following experiment
to evaluate this hypothesis. Based on pilot data, we predicted that visual stimuli presented early in saccade
preparation would be perceived more slowly than such stimuli presented later during saccade preparation. In
particular, we predicted that distinct visual latencies of the
early and late saccade preparation periods would cause a
different inter-modality point of subjective simultaneity,
since visual perceptual latency would be altered while auditory perceptual latency remained constant.

Methodological considerations

1569

While studies of the perception of the relative timing of
pairs of events have typically constrained themselves to one
modality, investigating the timing of a single stimulus requires the use of a 'temporal yardstick'. In the case of brain
imaging and EEG this is simply the precise timing of the
equipment used. However, we can also use another sensory
modality as our yardstick, provided we are confident that it
will not be warped by our experimental manipulations. This
confidence is difficult to come by in our proposed paradigm,

as the complex integration of auditory and visual stimuli is
the norm rather than the exception. In Morrone et al.
(2005a) they test for auditory ‘temporal compression’ effects caused by saccades and find none. In our use of a
multimodal paradigm we built on this result and determined
experimentally that saccade preparation also had no effect
on the perceived order of a pair of auditory stimuli (experiment one). We took care in the design of our multimodal
experiment to consider and if necessary control for ‘prior
entry’ effects, possible effects of audio-visual recalibration
caused by a constant audio-visual temporal offset, the temporal ‘cross-capture’ of audition and vision, spatial source
effects, and effects of additional auditory stimuli on saccadic latencies. These possible confounds are discussed in
the appendix.

General Method
In both experiments subjects were seated approximately 30
cm from a CRT display running at 120 Hz. Eye movements
were monitored using an SR Research Eyelink II camerabased eye tracker sampling the most accurate eye at 500 Hz.
Each trial began with the subject staring at a 1° in diameter
black fixation point (FP1) 15 degrees left of the midline
projected against a 20 cd/m2 red background (Figure 3).
After a random interval of between 225 and 425 ms FP1
was extinguished and an identical fixation point was presented 15 degrees right of the midline (FP2). Subjects were
instructed to look to FP2 as quickly as possible. Auditory
stimuli synchronization to visual stimuli was verified and
calibrated using an oscilloscope, and auditory stimuli were
presented to participants using headphones.

Experiment one
Stimuli and apparatus
In the first auditory-stimuli-only control experiment, two 4
ms auditory ‘clicks’ (at 1000 and 1750 Hz) were presented
with a mean onset time between 67 and 117 ms after the
appearance of FP2. These stimuli timings were chosen to
maximize the number of stimuli that occurred during the
critical 70 to 30 ms pre-saccadic period identified by Morrone et al. under the assumption that saccadic reaction times
would average 140 ms. The time between stimuli ranged
evenly between 8 and 92 ms. After every trial the subject
(LT) indicated using a button press which stimulus (the high
pitched click or the low pitched click) occurred first. One
block of 440 trials was run and analyzed.

Results
Performance was perfect under all stimulus timings and all
orderings, irrespective of Relative Onset Time. Most importantly, performance remained perfect even during the
critical inversion time window (Figure 2).

Experiment two
Stimuli and apparatus
The target experiment was an audio-visual version of experiment one. Trial sequences were nearly identical, with
the subject staring at FP1 until its offset and the onset of
FP2. To mitigate problems of motor-sensory recalibration
(Stetson et al., 2006) and prior entry (Vibell et al., 2007;
Zampini et al., 2005) we presented a auditory cue (4 ms,
1000 Hz) in conjunction with the visual saccade cue (i.e.,
onset of FP2 coincided with a auditory ‘click’). After the
audio-visual ‘go’ signal subjects were presented with one
auditory (4 ms, 1750 Hz) and one visual stimulus in randomly varying orders and at randomly varying interstimulus intervals (uniformly among 0 to 200 ms). The visual stimulus was evenly either at the top or bottom of the
screen. While it is impossible to predict exactly when the
subject was going to begin his eye movement, stimuli were
optimized for each subject’s saccadic reaction time so that
flash stimuli occurred around 50 ms before saccade onset.
Each subject’s task was to indicate using a button press
which modality was presented first.
The task was a difficult one and potential subjects were
first tested at fixation (without an eye movement) in their
ability to perform multimodal temporal order judgments.
Of the five potential subjects tested, only three could perform the task at fixation. We only accepted data when the
subject could in testing, on the day of data collection,
achieve better than 75% correct over 20 trials with interstimulus intervals (ISIs – time between the click and the
flash) ranging evenly between 17 and 92 ms inclusive. In
this paper we present two subjects’ data (two males, one
naïve to the purposes of the experiment); the third indicated
he was not performing saccade-like eye movements and his
data have been excluded. The first subject (LT) performed
16 blocks of 96 trials over multiple days, and the second
(AT) performed 8 blocks of 96 trials over multiple days.

Analysis

Analysis

As in experiment one we calculated offline the saccade onset time of every trial. Whereas in our first experiment and
in Morrone et al. (2005a) mean onset time of both stimuli
relative to saccade onset time was the value of interest, in
experiment two we were only interested in the relative onset
time of each trial’s visual stimulus, since we assumed the
timing of auditory perception was not systematically affected by its time of presentation relative to saccade onset.
For experiment two, then, Relative Onset Time refers exclusively to the timing of the presentation of the visual
stimulus.

After data collection the mean of the two click onset times
relative to the eye-tracker-provided saccade onset time was
calculated. We refer to this derived measure as ‘Relative
Onset Time’. We then fitted psychometric curves to the
data according to the subject’s indication of which stimulus
appeared to have happened first. Data were binned to ensure unambiguous and sufficient data existed for each plot
point.
1570

Our hypothesis was that stimuli early in the saccadic window (160 to 50 ms pre-saccade) would be processed slower
than those in the later window (50 to 0 ms pre-saccade). To
test our hypothesis we analyzed data separately in these two
windows. Trials were divided by Relative Onset Time (of
their flash stimulus) into those occurring either early or late
in saccade preparation. Data were then binned (13 bins, -200
to 200 ms mid-bin) by ISI in order to construct a logisticbased psychometric function. This was done using psignifit
toolbox version 2.5.6 for Matlab (see http://bootstrapsoftware.org/psignifit/), a software package which implements the maximum-likelihood method described by
Wichmann and Hill (2001a). Confidence intervals were similarly found by the BCa bootstrap method implemented by
psignifit, based on 4999 simulations (Wichmann and Hill
2001b). Our value of interest, the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS), was the signed time (based on stimulus
ordering – negative indicated auditory stimulus preceded
visual stimulus) between the two stimuli when the subject
would have been equally likely to indicate that either stimulus occurred first (0.5 on the ordinate axis).

Results
Using the above-described bootstrap software, subject LT’s
point of subject simultaneity was calculated to be approximately -38 ms for early period (-160 to -50 ms) flash stimuli
and -83 ms for late (-50 to 0) period flash stimuli, a difference of 45 ms (Figure 4). The two-tailed 95% confidence
interval on the difference between the early-period and lateperiod PSS was significant at the 0.05 level. Subject AT’s
data showed the same pattern as LT’s and was nearsignificant (but not significant at the 0.05 level). His early
period PSS was +10 ms and his late period PSS was
-32 ms (Figure 4), a difference of 42 ms, similar to that of
LT. These results suggest that on average, visual stimuli
occurring early in saccade preparation (between 160 and 50
ms pre-saccade) have a perceptual latency around 40 ms
longer than visual stimuli occurring late in saccade preparation (50 to 0 ms pre-saccade).

Discussion
Our data indicate that Morrone et al.’s temporal inversion
illusion is likely caused by a difference in the perceptual
latencies of stimuli presented earlier versus later in saccade
preparation. Because of the 40 ms latency difference, pairs
of visual stimuli occurring 20 ms apart and in different
preparation time-windows would be seen as reversed. The
first stimulus would have a latency of x ms, the second a
latency of
] ms, leading to the

perception that the latter stimulus occurred 20 ms before the
earlier one.
There are a number of explanations for why such saccaderelated delays or accelerations could be happening. Morrone et al. (2005a) originally proposed that the compression
may have been caused by the slowing of a ‘neural clock’,
but themselves admitted that this did not explain the inversion effect. They later suggested (Morrone et al., 2005b)
that postdiction in combination with relativistic effects resulting from the speed of information transfer in the
updating of spatiotopic fields may explain the temporal inversion illusion. This explanation, however, has also not
been given in any detail.
Interestingly, follow-up neurophysiological work (Ibbotson et al., 2006) found that MT neurons respond at different
latencies depending on when during saccade preparation the
stimulus is presented, however the only effect described was
significantly faster latencies for stimuli immediately preceding the physical onset of the saccade. This result is
compatible with our finding of shorter perceived latencies in
the period 40 to 50 ms before saccade onset. All the research just discussed, however, assumes the existence of a
‘neural clock’ upstream of the affected processing. Timing
using such a clock is usually assumed to be done through
the use of an oscillator and an accumulator. State dependent
networks (SDNs) are an alternative account which may be
more appropriate for the short intervals in which we are
interested. SDNs represent time as the development of a
dynamic physical system (Karmarkar & Buonomano, 2007),
and are more flexible since they need not represent time
‘linearly’ as oscillation-accumulator systems must.
To conclude, though the original Morrone et al. (2005a)
study set out to investigate the perception of timing around
the onset of eye movements, this reversal of perceived order
is qualitatively different from a simple error in time measurement. Whereas it is easy to imagine a distinct neural
mechanism for judging the passage of time and the duration
of intervals, we would expect the kinds of errors this mechanism made would be products of biases and a lack of
precision, errors which are consonant with a notion of unidirectional time. Errors of the ordering of perception do not
agree in this way, suggesting that they are not the product of
a mechanism for measuring the perception of timing. Instead, these errors point to a different field of study: the
timing of perception.

Morrone et al (2005). The subject fixated a point on the left
side of the screen. A target appeared to the right side of the
screen. While the subject was preparing to saccade, two 8
ms flashes with varying ISIs were presented at the top and
bottom of the screen. Our multimodal paradigm (experiment two) is identical, save that one of the flashes is
replaced by an audible 4 ms ‘click’. Experiment one is
identical save that both flashes are replaced by different
frequency ‘clicks’.

window.

Appendix: Treatment of possible confounds

Acknowledgments

The ‘prior-entry’ effect remains the subject of some debate,
but essentially it is the speeded processing and lower latency
of one stimulus caused by increased attention to its modality
or source. This effect could have biased the perceived latency
of visual stimuli. To eliminate prior-entry effects we thus
used both a visual and auditory saccade ‘go’ cue (FP2).
It has been found that additional auditory stimuli after the
presentation of a saccadic target can modulate the saccadic
reaction time (Colonius & Arndt, 2001). The use of a FP2
auditory onset cue should mitigate this because the effect of
the auditory onset cue is to make the two auditory stimuli into
one ‘double click’ with variable inter-click timing. Additionally, every trial employed the same amplitude saccade to
the same target in visual space, which helps in saccade planning, reducing the effects of ‘distractor’ auditory stimuli.
The plasticity of the relationship between auditory and visual stimuli was also the cause of some concern, and the
repeated simultaneous multimodal auditory 'go' signal was
also helpful in preventing the recalibration of auditory-visual
relationships (Stetson et al., 2006).
High precision multimodal order judgments are difficult to
perform and require constant attention. To help maintain
high levels of subject performance we performed a small
amount of without-saccade audio-visual temporal order
judgment training each day before running subjects (more
details in the experiment two stimuli and apparatus section).
Also, during the experiment order judgment feedback was
given when the timing of the eye movement resulted in stimuli being presented far before or far after saccade onset (200
ms before or 70 ms after).
The cross-capture of audition and vision refers to the tendency for asynchronous audio-visual stimuli to be drawn to
each other in their perceived timing (Fendrich & Corballis,
2001). While this might well affect our stimulus presentation,
the effect should remain constant irrespective of the timing of
the eye movement (and it is only in relation to the eye movement’s timing that we are interested in the different
relationship of the audio-visual stimuli). Consequently,
cross-capture may weaken effects of saccade preparation on
perceived stimulus latency but should not confound them.
Some results suggest that saccadic latencies can be affected
by the spatial relationship between the perceived location of
the auditory stimulus and the location of the visual one
(Zampini et al., 2003), a possible effect we controlled for by
presenting both visual and auditory stimuli centrally.
Lastly, the difficulty of the task restricted the useful subject
pool somewhat, and has been raised as a possible confound.
We have found that individuals with significant musical experience are ideal candidates for this study as they have good
multimodal temporal order resolution abilities, and both subjects used had such experience. Our study, however, is
focused on visual processing, and it has been found that musicians do not possess superior eye movement abilities
(Gruhn et al., 2006) or improved saccadic reaction times.
