evidence that people use a strategy that relies on associating
cues along a dimension to multiple different linear
functions.
     The general rule-based models were favored early on
because of the mere fact that people could generalize
learned knowledge. The thought was that if only exemplar
based associations were being developed, then nothing can
associate with cues that have not been presented. Later
models either used hybrid association / rule mechanisms or
used pure association by relying on the continuous nature of
the stimuli in function learning tasks.
Model Comparison
Currently, two major models have been used to explain
observations of general training, interpolation, and
extrapolation behaviors. The Extrapolation-Association

      All sessions involved 207 trials organized as follows:
The initial 10 cues were of magnitudes defined by a random
permutation of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, & 90. The next
24 items contain 12 cues from range 5-35 and 12 from range
65-95 in random order. The following 3 blocks contain 12
cues from range 5-35 and 12 from range 65-95 and 4 from
range 40-60 in random order. The final 3 blocks contain 12
cues from range 5-35 and 12 from range 65-95 and 6 from
range 40-60 in random order.
      This order was used to satisfy several goals. First, I
wanted a general idea of the initial biases of the participant,
so the first block of 10 trials were all given without
providing feedback. Next, I wanted to provide some initial
training that spanned the entire training range. Third, I
wanted to investigate knowledge generalization throughout
