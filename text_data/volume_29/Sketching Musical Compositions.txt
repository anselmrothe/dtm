       Case Study: Sketching a Composition.
In order to get a deeper understanding of what sketches can
contribute to the composition process we carried out a
detailed case study of the drawings produced by one
questionnaire respondent: Samuel Freeman, a contemporary
composer. His work was used because he had retained all
the sketches produced for a single commission.
