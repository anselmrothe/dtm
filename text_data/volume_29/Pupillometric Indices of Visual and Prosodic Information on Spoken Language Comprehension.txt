1984). More specifically, prominent prosodic breaks tend to
occur at major syntactic breaks (Ferreira, 1993).1 This fact
naturally leads to the prediction that prosody should
influence initial syntactic parsing, and the results from
several studies confirm this prediction (Kjelgaard & Speer,
1999; Nagel, Shapiro, Tuller, & Nawy, 1996; Price,
Ostendorf, Shattuck-Hufnagel, & Fong, 1991; Speer,
Kjelgaard, & Dobroth, 1996). However, other studies have
shown little or no effect of prosody (Allbritton et al., 1996).
The data are mixed but the bulk of the evidence indicates
that prosodic boundaries should allow a hearer to
perceptually group syntactic constituents, thereby informing
immediate parsing decisions.
The main issue addressed in Experiment 1 was the time
course in which prosody influences the processing of a
garden-path sentence. Restricted processing models assume
that initial parsing is based on a limited amount of
information. Speer and colleagues (1996) argued that
prosodic structure determines initial syntactic constituency
(see also Frazier, 1987). Marcus and Hindle (1990) in
contrast, argued that prosody affects parsing only after a
syntactically-based initial parse.
Unrestricted or interactive processing models assume that
any type of information can immediately influence
processing (Spivey & Tanenhaus, 1998). Therefore, prosody
or visual context which either supports or refutes a gardenpath interpretation should affect initial syntactic decisions.
Support for such models has come from referential context
effects, primarily involving the presuppositions on the
felicitous use of modified noun phrases (Tanenhaus, SpiveyKnowlton, Eberhard, & Sedivy, 1995). The general finding
is that participants are more likely to pursue a modifier
interpretation of an ambiguous prepositional phrase when
the visual context contains multiple referents.

Abstract
Two experiments investigated the effects of prosody and visual
context on syntactic ambiguity resolution. The results from the
first experiment showed increased processing difficulty when
prosodic structure conflicted with syntactic structure, consistent
with previous reports. In the second, both prosody and visual
context were manipulated. The results showed that conflicting
visual context cancelled the effects of cooperative prosody,
suggesting that visual context has a greater effect on ambiguity
resolution than does prosody. These results are consistent with
models of sentence processing, which assume that both topdown and bottom-up information can affect online processing.

Introduction
The integration of different sources of information continues
to be a central topic in the field of natural language
comprehension. One of the primary ways that researchers
have addressed this question is by examining sentences that
contain locally competing syntactic analyses. Many of the
seminal studies in this area were conducted using written
materials and the dependent measure was fixation location
and duration. In the current experiments, we examined the
effects of prosody and visual context on the processing of
spoken garden-path sentences. Garden-path sentences
contain a temporary syntactic ambiguity in which a listener
is led into an incorrect interpretation and then later material
signals that an error has been made. Fox Tree and Meijer
(2000) looked at effects of prosody and discourse-level
linguistic context on the final interpretation of ambiguous
sentences. Their results indicated that discourse context had
a greater effect on ambiguity resolution than did prosody.
The goal of the current experiments was similar, except that
we examined the online processing of both prosody and
visual context in order to more accurately specify the time
course in which these information sources affect ambiguity
resolution.
Prosody is the stress, timing, and intonation of an
utterance, and is related to syntactic structure (Selkirk,

1

The most reliable prosodic cues to syntactic structure are
amplitude and durational cues (Ferreira, 1993). The most effective
use of these cues is tasks where two participants interact freely
(Kraljic & Brennan, 2005; Schafer, Speer, Warren, & White,
2000).

In sum, restricted processing models assume that the
initial parse should be impervious to top-down information.
Unrestricted models assume that any type of relevant
information can be used by the sentence processor. The
strongest evidence for these assumptions is an effect of
linguistic discourse or visual context biasing the parser to a
more
complex
interpretation.
However,
recent
pragmatically-based arguments have questioned the
interpretation of these data (Engelhardt, Bailey, & Ferreira,
2006). Therefore, the primary purpose of the current study
was to further investigate these theoretical controversies in
the sentence processing literature.

Experiment 1
In the first experiment prosody either conflicted with or was
cooperative with respect to the correct syntactic structure
(see example 1). Sentences with cooperative prosody were
spoken with an intermediate prosodic break between
cleaned and the dog (see Figure 1). Notice that in Figures 1
and 2 the highlighted area shows the intransitive verb (i.e.
cleaned). Sentences with conflicting prosody were spoken
as if the dog were the direct object of the verb cleaned (see
Figure 2). If prosody influences comprehension, then we
expect more incorrect responses to questions like example 2
with conflicting prosody compared with cooperative
prosody. The dependent measures were comprehension
accuracy and pupil diameter.

(3) Did the dog stand in the yard? (matrix)
Pupil diameter has been shown to be a reliable index of
processing intensity during syntactic ambiguity resolution.
Just and Carpenter (1993) investigated the processing of
subject and object relative sentences. Their results showed a
reliable increase in pupil diameter peaking 1.2 sec following
the location in a sentence where processing demands
increased. The purpose of the first experiment was to
determine if an appropriately placed intermediate prosodic
break would influence the processing and interpretation of
sentences like example 1.

Methods

Pupil diameter was monitored with an Eyelink II at 500 Hz.
Pupil data were analyzed in a 1200 ms window beginning
200 ms past the onset of the disambiguating word to allow
for word recognition to have taken place. Blinks were
filtered and missing data were replaced using linear
interpolation. Pupil diameter was analyzed for correct trials
only2, and a simple regression using time as an independent
variable and pupil diameter as a dependent variable was

Participants
Eighteen participants from the Michigan State University
subject pool were recruited to participate. All participants
were native speakers of English.

Materials and Apparatus
Stimulus materials consisted of thirty sentences containing
optionally transitive subordinate verbs (Christianson,
Hollingworth, Halliwell, & Ferreira, 2001).

Correct trials indicate that participants fully reanalyzed the
sentence, indicating they got the correct interpretation.

Pupil diameter slope was analyzed as a one-way ANOVA
with three levels. The results showed a significant main
effect of prosody F1(2, 34) = 4.21, p < .05; F2(2, 58) =
5.35, p < .05 (see Figure 4). Simple effects tests revealed
that the conflicting prosody condition had a significantly
greater slope than both of the cooperative prosody
conditions t(17) = 2.54, p < .05 and t(17) = 2.65, p < .05.
The cooperative prosody conditions were not different from
one another. These results show that when syntactic
structure and prosodic structure conflict, pupil diameter
reliably increases, whereas when the prosody and syntax
coincide, pupil slope is negative.

used to determine pupil diameter slope for each participant
in each condition.

Design and Procedure
The design was 2 (Question type) x 3 (Prosody type).
Questions queried either the subordinate or matrix clause.
Prosody was either conflicting or cooperative. Conflicting
prosody sentences had no break between the ambiguous
noun phrase and the intransitive verb. Cooperative prosody
was created in a separate utterance by placing an
intermediate prosodic break between clauses. Two levels of
Cooperative prosody were created by varying the length of
the pause following the intransitive verb, lengths were 200
or 400 ms. Participants were instructed that they would hear
a sentence followed by a comprehension question. Their
task was to look at a fixation cross during the sentence, and
then to answer the comprehension question. Participants
completed three practice trials and 100 regular session trials.
Fillers included 25 main-subordinate sentences, and the
entire session lasted ~ 40 min. Analyses were conducted
with subjects (F1) and items (F2) as random factors.

Results
Prior to the analysis, fixation location was checked to ensure
that participants were viewing the fixation cross as they
listened to the sentences. Comprehension accuracy showed
that both main effects were significant [Question F1(1, 17)

the interaction F1(2, 34) = 4.75, p < .05; F2(2, 58) = 3.95, p
< .05 (see Figure 3). Simple effects showed that the
conflicting prosody/subordinate question condition was
significantly worse t(17) = -2.83, p < .05 than the
conflicting prosody/matrix question condition. Neither of
the paired comparisons with the cooperative prosody were
significant. These results show that conflicting prosody
leads to more incorrect garden-path interpretations.

disambiguating word (i.e. stood, in example 1).
Returning to the models reviewed above, we can conclude
that conflicting prosody leads to processing difficulty
beginning shortly after the onset of the disambiguating word
compared with both of the cooperative prosody conditions.
This finding supports the assumption that cooperative
prosodic structure can be utilized by the sentence processor
to inform syntactic decisions. This result is consistent with
models of sentence processing in which bottom-up
information can affect initial syntactic parsing (Frazier,
1987; Speer et al., 1996; Spivey & Tanenhaus, 1998).

In the second experiment, we manipulated both bottom-up
and top-down information sources. The same sound files
from Experiment 1 were used, so there were three levels of
prosody. Visual context had two levels. Inconsistent visual
context depicted the misinterpretation. For example (1),
inconsistent visual context showed a picture of a woman
cleaning a dog. Consistent visual context depicted a woman
cleaning something that was not a dog. If visual information
can influence parsing as predicted by unrestricted
processing models, then we should see an effect of visual
context on pupil diameter. However, if initial parsing is

reveals that the interaction is largely driven by performance
with inconsistent Visual context. Here the 200ms
Cooperative prosody was not different from the Conflicting
prosody t(17) = .54, p > .05, but both were significantly
different from the 400ms Cooperative prosody [200ms t(17)
= 3.48, p < .05 & Conflicting t(17) = 2.18, p < .05]. This
suggests that inconsistent Visual context overrides the
disambiguating effect of 200ms Cooperative prosody.
Another interesting result was that consistent Visual context
seemed to reduce processing effort with the Conflicting
prosody, as evidenced by the flattening out of the pupil
slope, suggesting that reanalysis is completed ~600 ms after
disambiguation. Pupil diameter indicates greater processing
effort with inconsistent Visual context in both the
Conflicting and 200ms Cooperative prosody conditions.
These data suggest that visual information influences
processing with both Conflicting and Cooperative prosody.

Methods
Participants
Eighteen participants from the Michigan State University
subject pool were recruited to participate. All were native
speakers of English.

Materials
The materials were the same as Experiment 1, except that
pictures matching two interpretations of the sentence were
created.3

Design and Procedure
The design was 2 (Visual context) x 3 (Prosody type).
Visual context depicted either the misinterpretation or a
consistent interpretation. Prosody was either Conflicting,
Cooperative (200), or Cooperative (400). Pictures appeared
in the center of the computer screen at the same time as the
sentence began. The same procedures were used as in
Experiment 1, except participants were told that they would
be presented with a spoken sentence and a picture which
may or may not be consistent with the sentence. Their task
was to answer the comprehension question on the basis of
the information presented in the sentence.

Fixation location was again examined prior to statistical
analyses in order to ensure that participants were fixating
the pictures as they listened to the sentences.
Comprehension accuracy showed a significant main effect
of Prosody F1(2, 34) = 13.41, p < .01; F2(2, 58) = 23.72, p
< .01, and there was a marginal effect of Visual context
F1(1, 17) = 3.56, p = .08; F2(1, 29) = 4.17, p = .05. The
interaction was not significant (see Figure 5). The simple
effects showed only one marginal effect of visual context.
The 200 ms Cooperative prosody condition with
inconsistent visual context resulted in slightly more
misinterpretations than did consistent visual context.
Prosody showed a robust main effect. Visual context, in
contrast showed only a marginal effect, and here the results
suggested that inconsistent visual context results in slightly
worse performance across the board.
Pupil slope showed a main effect of Prosody type F1(2,
34) = 3.81, p < .05; F2(2, 58) = 7.96, p < .05, and a
significant interaction F1(2, 34) = 3.19, p = .05; F2(2, 58) =
2.52, p = .089. The main effect of Visual context was not
significant. Examining the results in Figures 6, 7, and 8

presented at the beginning of the utterance, therefore there
was sufficient opportunity for the visual context to activate
conceptual-level representations, which could have in turn
primed the incorrect proposition that the woman cleaned the
dog (see Henderson & Ferreira, 2004 for a review of the
interface between vision and language). This explanation is
all the more plausible considering that gist extraction from a
scene occurs in less than 100ms (Castellanos & Henderson,
submitted). In addition, there is some evidence to suggest
that the processing system engages in some degree of
syntactic prediction (Lau, Stroud, Plesch, & Phillips, 2006;
Staub & Clifton, 2006). Given these facts it is not possible
to definitely conclude that these data support unrestricted
processing models. In current work, we are varying the
onset of the visual context in order to determine the exact
time course in which visual information exerts its effect.
These results are noteworthy for two additional theoretical
reasons and one methodological reason. The first theoretical
reason is that these findings corroborate the implicit prosody
hypothesis (Fodor, 1998). This hypothesis assumes that
readers project a prosodic contour onto sentences when
reading. Many psycholinguistic studies have invoked this
assumption to explain parsing preferences. Support for the
implicit prosody hypothesis was observed in Experiment 1,
where auditory sentences with conflicting prosody produced
similar comprehension scores as previous research has
shown with written materials. Therefore, our data indirectly
support the assumption that readers impose the incorrect
prosodic structure on garden-path sentences.
The second theoretical contribution concerns the
conclusions made by Carlson et al. (2001). These authors
argued that prosodic boundaries are not interpreted with
respect to the absolute size of any particular prosodic
boundary. Instead they argued that prosodic structure is
interpreted based on the relative size of the boundary with
respect to the global prosodic structure. Our results are
contrary to these arguments because pupil diameter showed
dramatic differences between the 200ms and 400ms
Cooperative prosody conditions in Experiment 2, which
suggests that the absolute duration of a boundary can affect
online processing.
Finally, the methodological importance of this work
concerns the use of pupil diameter as a dependent measure.
Online investigations of spoken language comprehension
have traditionally been limited to cross-modal lexical
decision. The Visual World Paradigm was revolutionary in
its ability to demonstrate distinct interpretations of
ambiguous utterances based on fixation location (Tanenhaus
et al., 1995). The current work which used pupil diameter
shows similar promise for testing the competing models of
sentence processing. If pupil diameter proves reliable across
different paradigms and in different contexts, then
psycholinguists have one more implicit online measure of
processing difficulty than those used previously (cf. Just &
Carpenter, 1993).

General Discussion
The results from the first experiment showed that when
prosody conflicts with syntactic structure, participants are
more likely to misinterpret the sentence. More importantly,
pupil diameter showed a clear positive slope in the
disambiguating region, which suggests a higher processing
load with Conflicting prosody, as expected. This finding
supports models of sentence processing in which bottom-up
information can affect initial syntactic processing (Frazier,
1987; Speer et al., 1996). The results from the second
experiment showed that when the visual context supports
the misinterpretation, participants are more likely to be
garden-pathed. Here inconsistent Visual context appears to
hurt performance in the 200ms Cooperative prosody
condition. This result is supportive of unrestricted
processing models. However, visual contexts were

In conclusion, the current experiments showed that when
no visual context was present prosody is a robust
disambiguator of syntactic ambiguity. These results were
evident in both the online and offline measures. The second
experiment showed that Inconsistent visual context impaired
performance in the 200ms Cooperative prosody condition.
This result suggests that visual context can affect initial
parsing, which would be consistent with unrestricted models
of sentence processing. Further research will investigate the
exact time-course of integrating visual, prosodic, and
syntactic information.
