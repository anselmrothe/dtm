   In sum, restricted processing models assume that the
initial parse should be impervious to top-down information.
Unrestricted models assume that any type of relevant
information can be used by the sentence processor. The
strongest evidence for these assumptions is an effect of
linguistic discourse or visual context biasing the parser to a
more       complex     interpretation.    However,      recent
pragmatically-based arguments have questioned the
interpretation of these data (Engelhardt, Bailey, & Ferreira,
2006). Therefore, the primary purpose of the current study
was to further investigate these theoretical controversies in
the sentence processing literature.
                       Experiment 1
In the first experiment prosody either conflicted with or was
cooperative with respect to the correct syntactic structure
(see example 1). Sentences with cooperative prosody were
spoken with an intermediate prosodic break between
cleaned and the dog (see Figure 1). Notice that in Figures 1
and 2 the highlighted area shows the intransitive verb (i.e.
cleaned). Sentences with conflicting prosody were spoken                Figure 1: Wave form for cooperative (200) prosody.

Figure 2). If prosody influences comprehension, then we
expect more incorrect responses to questions like example 2
with conflicting prosody compared with cooperative
prosody. The dependent measures were comprehension

   Pupil diameter has been shown to be a reliable index of
processing intensity during syntactic ambiguity resolution.
Just and Carpenter (1993) investigated the processing of
subject and object relative sentences. Their results showed a
reliable increase in pupil diameter peaking 1.2 sec following
the location in a sentence where processing demands
increased. The purpose of the first experiment was to
determine if an appropriately placed intermediate prosodic
break would influence the processing and interpretation of
sentences like example 1.
