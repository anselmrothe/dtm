     People sometimes acquire new knowledge from
what they already know (Genter & Wolff, 2000). They
transform their knowledge to represent the world in
new ways, or rearrange what they know to arrive at new
conclusions. Sometimes learning involves taking
conceptual structures apart so that new structures can be
formed in their place. Acquiring knowledge in this                Fig. 1. Relationships can combine to form a new structure.
