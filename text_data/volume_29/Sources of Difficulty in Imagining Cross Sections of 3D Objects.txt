Procedure
     Participants were tested in four groups of 15. The
experimenter asked the participants to read the instructions
silently as she read them aloud to the group.
Test instructions
Four pages of written instructions, including a sample
problem, precede the 30 test items. The instructions define
the term ‘cross section,’ and illustrate the types of geometric
structure and cutting plane orientations in the test. The           Figure 4. Mean proportion of items correct on Santa

   In summary, we developed a novel psychometric test that

supported. First, test items with oblique cutting planes were
