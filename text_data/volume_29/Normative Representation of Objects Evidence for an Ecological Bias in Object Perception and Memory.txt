Results
A measure of sensitivity (d-prime) was calculated for each
type of change (change toward the norm, change away from
the norm), by taking the z-score of the percent hits minus
the z-score of the percent false alarms. An ANOVA was
computed on d-prime with change type (toward vs. away)
and starting size (too-big vs. too-small) as factors. There
