property (Clark, 1997; Golinkoff, Mervis, and Hirsh-Pasek,
1994; Soja, Carey, and Spelke, 1991; Markman, 1990;
Landau, Smith, and Jones, 1988; Macnamara, 1982; Keil,
1991). However, children’s adjective-like interpretations
of novel words increase (Klibanoff and Waxman, 2000;
Waxman and Klibanoff, 2000; Waxman, 1998) in contexts
in which the object category is named. These phenomena
have been interpreted by some as indicating early
knowledge of syntax-meaning correspondences (Waxman,
1998; Mintz and Gleitman, 2002).
   Mintz and Gleitman (2002) reported the specific result
that motivates the experiments in this paper. They
contrasted two kinds of sentences in which a novel
adjective might be embedded. In one of these, the novel
adjective modified a pronoun, “This is a stoof one”. In the
other, the novel adjective modified a basic level noun,
“This is a stoof elephant”. They reasoned, on linguistic             Figure 1: Illustration of a parallel structure between

supports the idea that the activation of these past
associations contributed to the shift in attention to texture.
The 2-year-olds’ pattern of performance thus fits the
hypothesis, and shows how a domain general mechanism
of attention shifting could lead to the learning of adjectives
without any necessary knowledge of the syntactic category
of adjective or its link to semantic categories.
   The older children’s pattern of performance does not fit
this prediction. Given sentence frames with scrambled
word order or with only a modified pronoun, these children
do not map the novel word to a property. Given older
