the premises, an inspection phase, in which the model is in-
spected to check if a putative conclusion is consistent with
the current model. In the validation phase, finally, alternative
models are generated from the premises that refute this pu-
tative conclusion. In our example presented above, the exact
relation between “Y” and “G” is not specified and leads to
multiple-model cases like R Y O G B or R Y G O B. This
is caused by the indeterminacy effect and is mainly responsi-
ble for human difficulty in reasoning (Johnson-Laird, 2001).
The classical MMT is not able to explain a phenomenon en-
countered in multiple-model cases, namely that humans gen-
erally tend to construct a preferred mental model (PMM). This
model is easier to construct, less complex, and easier to main-
tain in working memory compared to all other possible mod-
els (Knauff, Rauh, Schlieder, & Strube, 1998). The principle
of economicity is the determining factor in explaining human
preferences (Manktelow, 1999). This principle also explains                             Figure 2: The CR OS -Model
