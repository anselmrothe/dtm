                               Abstract
   Two experiments examined how categories derived from
   experience and those derived from perception affect spatial
   memory. Four kinds of objects were distributed within a circle
   and spatially clustered so that all objects of each kind appeared
   within the same spatial region. These identity-based categories
   were either aligned with or in opposition to the perceptually-
   based quadrant categories that are imposed on the circle by
   default. When remembering only one object location at a time,
   participants used only the default categories and not the
   identity-based categories to reconstruct memories. When
   remembering four objects simultaneously, participants
   combined inductive experience with the default category
   structure to organize space.
