   After an initial calibration procedure, using the Viewpoint
eye tracking software, participants where given their search
task in the manner described above and commenced their
search. Given the physical structure of the Viewpoint Eye-
Tracker (which uses a mounted camera with forehead and
chin rests) and some participant’s predisposition to fidget, it
was necessary to perform additional eye-tracking calibration
during the search tasks. This additional calibration required
the participants to focus on targets in nine separate regions
of the monitor. Moreover, these targets were automatically              Figure 1: Example of a LSA-SF Map with a participant’s
