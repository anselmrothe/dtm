view paradigm are stable across multiple views of the same
stimulus, and are thus just like any other sequential motor
skill, making them subject to memory mechanisms and
proceduralization. Theories of behavioral refinement (e.g.,
soft constraints theory) state that behavior is adjusted to
reduce cost in units of time during goal-oriented tasks.
Consequently, it is likely that visual scans repeatedly used
during a goal-oriented task are adapted to the environment
through some refinement mechanism. Such an adaptation
could occur by reducing the number of eye movements
necessary to obtain the goal over repeated exposures to the
same stimulus. Finally, it is possible that the two hypotheses
just presented are the mechanism behind the contextual
cueing phenomenon, elaborated in the following section.
The Contextual Cueing Phenomenon
Previous research has demonstrated that visual context
implicitly guides spatial attention during visual search tasks
