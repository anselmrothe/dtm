      Incremental understanding also places requirements on the speech recognizer (production of partial hypotheses), the
          parser (incremental construction of charts), the interpretation manager and behavioral agent (handling partial
    interpretations and actions), and the visual world simulator (incorporation of semantic models of partial actions) which
                                   are also important to the overall functioning of the system.
