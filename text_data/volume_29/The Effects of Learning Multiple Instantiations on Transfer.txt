given a multiple choice test designed to measure the ability to
apply the learned rules to novel problems. In total, 24
multiple-choice questions were posed in phase 1 (learning

domains. Participants who learned two instantiations had a
12-question test over the first domain and the remaining
twelve questions over the second domain. Participants who
learned three instantiations had 8-question tests over each
