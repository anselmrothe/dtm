Abstract

carefully controlled lab experiments are rare or absent in naturalistic data such as those found in corpora. The present paper aims to test DLT’s predictions on the Dundee Corpus, a
large corpus of newspaper text for which the eye-movement
record of 10 participants is available. From this corpus, a
range of eye-tracking measures can be computed, but the
results hold for naturalistic, contextualized text, rather than
for isolated example sentences manually constructed by psycholinguists.
In what follows, we will present two studies on the Dundee
Corpus that test DLT’s predictions for relative clauses, for two
different regions of analysis. We compare our results against a
baseline model that does not compute processing complexity
directly, but that instead relies on the transitional probability
between words.

We tested the predictions of Dependency Locality Theory
(DLT), a theory of linguistic processing complexity, against
reading time data extracted from a large eye-tracking corpus.
DLT predicts differences in processing complexity for subject
and non-subject relative clauses. We found elevated reading
times on two distinct regions of these relative clauses, in line
with the complexity effects predicted by DLT. We also found
that transitional probability has an effect on reading time in
these two regions, independent of the DLT effect. We argue
our approach provides an important new way of testing sentence processing theories by evaluating them against reading
data obtained from an eye-tracking corpus of naturally occurring text.

Introduction

Background

Research on human sentence processing has traditionally focused on syntactic ambiguity, based on the observation that
certain locally ambiguous constructions pose difficulty for
the human sentence processor. Such difficulty manifests itself
typically in the form of increased processing time (e.g., elevated reading times on the disambiguating region).
While disambiguation is an important source of difficulty
in human sentence processing, such difficulty can also arise
in unambiguous sentences. A classic example are relative
clauses, which have been investigated extensively in the literature on syntactic processing difficulty. Experimental results show that English subject relative clauses (SRCs) as
in (1-a) are easier to process than non-subject relative clauses
(NSRCs) as in (1-b). Experimentally, this difficulty is evidenced by the fact that reading times for the region R1 in
the SRC are lower than reading times for the corresponding
region R3 in the NSRC (King & Just, 1991).

Dependency Locality Theory
According to Gibson’s (1998; 2000) Dependency Locality
Theory, processing complexity is associated with the cost of
the computational resources consumed by the processor. Two
distinct cost components can be distinguished: the (i) integration cost associated with integrating new input into the structures already built at a given stage in the computation, and
(ii) the memory cost involved in the storage of parts of the input that may be used in parsing later parts of an input. Here,
we will focus on integration cost, as “reasonable first approximations of comprehensions times can be obtained from the
integrations costs alone, as long as the linguistic memory storage used is not excessive at these integration points” (Gibson,
1998, 19f). Integration cost is defined as follows:

Findings such as these have motivated processing theories
that do not rely on ambiguity resolution, but instead capture
the complexity involved in computing the syntactic dependencies between the words in a sentence. The most prominent such theory is Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), proposed by Gibson (1998, 2000). DLT not only captures a the
SRC/NSRC asymmetry, but also accounts for a wide range of
other complexity results, including processing overload phenomena such as center embedding and cross-serial dependencies.
While DLT has been validated against a large range of experimental results, it has not been shown that it can also successfully model complexity phenomena in naturally occurring text. It is possible that complexity effects observed in

Linguistic Integration Cost
The integration cost associated with integrating a new
input head h2 with a head h1 that is part of the current structure for the input consists of two parts: (1) a
cost dependent on the complexity of the integration
(e.g. constructing a new discourse referent); plus (2) a
distance-based cost: a monotone increasing function
I(n) energy units (EUs) of the number of new discourse referents that have been processed since h1 was
last highly activated. For simplicity, it is assumed that
I(n) = n EUs.
(Gibson, 1998, 12f)

According to this definition, integration cost is dependent on
two factors. First, the type of element to be integrated matters:
new discourse referents (e.g., indefinite NPs) are assumed
to involve a higher integration cost than old/established discourse referents, identified by pronominals. Second, integration cost is sensitive to the distance between the head being
integrated and the head it attaches to, where distance is calculated in terms of intervening discourse referents.

As an example, consider the subject vs. non-subject RC
example in (1). At the embedded verb region in the SRC (Region R1), two integrations take place: the gap generated by
the relative pronoun who needs to be integrated with the verb.
The cost for this is I(0), as zero new discourse referents have
been processed since the gap was encountered. In addition,
the embedded verb attacked needs to be integrated with its
preceding subject, an integration which crosses one new discourse referent (the embedded verb itself), leading to a cost
of I(1). The total cost at region R1 is therefore I(0) + I(1).
In the NSRC (Region R3), the integration cost is I(2) for
the integration of the gap generated by the relative pronoun,
as two new discourse referents (the senator and attacked) intervene between the gap and the embedded verb. In addition,
the integration of the verb with its subject the senator consumes I(1) energy units, as one new discourse referent has
been processed, viz., attacked itself. The total cost for R3 in
the NSRC is therefore I(2) + I(1). So overall, DLT predicts
that R3 is more difficult to process than R1.
It is also interesting to consider the DLT predictions for
another region, viz., the word immediately following the relative pronoun. In the SRC case, this region is again R1, the
verb attacked, with a cost of I(0) + I(1). In the NSRC case,
however, a noun phrase follows the relative pronoun, and the
relevant region is R2, the word the, which causes an integration cost of I(0), as no new discourse referents have been processed since the was encountered. Hence DLT predicts that
R1 is more difficult to process than R2.
The following summarizes the DLT predictions for SRCs
and NSRCs (see Gibson 1998, 20f):

tracted from an eye-tracking corpus (a smaller corpus than the
Dundee corpus used here) that show that forward and backward transitional probabilities are predictive of first fixation
and gaze durations: the higher the transitional probability, the
shorter the fixation time. By forward transitional probability McDonald & Shillcock (2003b) refer to the conditional
probability of a word given the previous word P(wn |wn−1 ),
while the backward transitional probability is the conditional
probability of a word given the next word P(wn |wn+1 ). These
corpus results are backed up by results demonstrating the
role of forward transitional probabilities in controlled reading experiments (McDonald & Shillcock 2003a; but see Frisson et al. 2006, who equate transitional probability and Cloze
predictability).
Given these findings, transitional probability provides a
potential alternative explanation for reading time effects in
corpus data. For example, in (1), the difference between
R1 and R3 could be simply due to an effect of forward
transitional probability: if P(attacked|who) is larger than
P(attacked|senator), then we predict that R1 is read more
quickly than R3, which is the same prediction that the DLT
makes. We will therefore include forward transitional probability in the corpus analyses presented below.

Method

Experiment 1: Embedded Verb Region
The aim of this experiment was to test a key prediction of
DLT, viz., that subject and non-subject relative clauses differ in the amount of difficulty encountered in the verb region
(regions R1 and R3 in (1)).

The reporter who attacked the senator admitted
– I(0)
I(0) I(0)+I(1) I(0) I(0)+I(1) I(3)
the error.
I(0) I(0)+I(1)

Transitional Probability

Data For our data analysis, we used the Dundee Corpus
(Kennedy et al., 2005), an English language eye-tracking corpus based on text from The Independent newspaper. The texts
contain about 51,000 words and were read by 10 native speakers of English. The text was presented on a computer screen,
five lines at a time at a line length of 80 characters.
Since the corpus data is not syntactically annotated, we
parsed the entire corpus with a state-of-the-art parser (Charniak, 2000). We checked parsing reliability for our target construction (relative clauses) on the 23rd section of the Wall
Street Journal and found recall to be 96% and precision to be
92%. In the Dundee Corpus, we found a total of 434 relative
clauses headed by who, which, or that. Since each of the items
was read by the 10 subjects, this provides us with 4340 data
points in total. However, we excluded some of the data points
according to the criteria described in the following section.

It is well-known that reading times in eye-tracking data are
influenced not only by high-level, syntactic variables but also
by a number of low-level variables that have to do with the
physiology of reading (see McDonald & Shillcock 2003b for
a review). These variables include word frequency (more frequent words are read faster), word length (shorter words are
read faster) and the landing position of the eye on the word.
Together with variation between readers, these variables account for a sizable proportion of the variance in the eyemovement record.
Recently, it has also been shown that information about the
sequential context of a word can influence reading times. In
particular, McDonald & Shillcock (2003b) present data ex-

Selection Criteria From the 4340 relative clauses, we automatically extracted the embedded verb (the verb heading the
relative clause). In relative clauses with auxiliaries or modals,
we extracted the main verb of the relative clause, because this
is where integration cost occurs. In the case of predicative
constructions, we extracted the inflected form of the predicative verb be.
We excluded all the data points where the critical region
(the embedded verb) was the first or last word of the line, and
also all cases where the verb was followed by a any kind of
punctuation. This eliminates wrap-up effects that occur at line
breaks or at the end of sentences. Furthermore, we excluded
all data points that were in a region of four or more adjacent

In what follows, we will compare reading times for SRCs and
NSRCs in an eye-tracking corpus for the embedded verb region (R1 vs. R3) and for the post-relative pronoun region (R1
vs. R2). We will also measure reading times on the relative
pronoun; here, DLT does not predict any differences in processing difficulty.

independent variables (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) (aka hierarchical linear regression models, Richter (2006)). To make
sure effects were stable across different modeling techniques,
we ran both a linear mixed effect model that included SUBJ
(the subject) as a random effect and also performed separate
regressions for each of the 10 subjects and tested whether
the coefficients for these models were reliably different from
zero using a t-test (as suggested in Lorch & Myers 1990,
method 3). Minimal models were obtained by entering all of
the independent variables and all possible binary interactions
between them into the model and then simplifying the model
by comparing Akaike Information Criterion values. (The AIC
is a measure that optimizes model fit by taking into account
the amount of variance explained as well as the number of
degrees of freedom.)
For the binary dependent variable (skipping), we ran a logistic regression model, using the same methods as for the
linear regression.

words that had not been fixated, since such regions were either not read by the participant or subject to data loss due to
tracking errors. We computed the reading times for regions
R1 and R3 for each item and each subject (a total of 3007
data points).
Independent Variables Each data point was associated
with eight variables. These were the identity of the relative
pronoun (who, which, or that), the type of the relative clause
(SRC or NSRC), word length, the logarithm of the word frequency (estimated from the British National Corpus, BNC),
the word’s part of speech (POS), the logarithm of the forward
transitional probability (P(wn |wn−1 ), where wn is the verb;
also estimated from the BNC), the word landing position, and
the subject ID. The following POS tags occurred: AUX, MD,
VB, VBP, VBN, VBG, VBD and VBZ (the Penn Treebank
POS tag set was used, see Marcus et al. 1993).
There are a number of well-known correlations between
the independent variables: short words are usually more frequent than long words, the fixation landing position depends
on word length, the transitional probability and the frequency
of a word are positively correlated. As Table 1 shows, the relative clause types were furthermore distributed differently for
the three pronouns, and thus partially correlate with RC types.

Results
Linear Regression for Fixated Words We fitted a mixed
effects regression model as specified above to the data. The
results show a significant main effect of relative clause type
(p < 0.001) for R1 and R3: SRC verbs were read more
quickly than NSRC verbs (see Table 2). We also found a
significant interaction between RC type and word frequency.
The word frequency effect by itself is well known: frequent
words are read faster than infrequent ones. The interaction
between word frequency and relative clause type reflects the
fact that in our data, the frequency effect was more pronounced in non-subject relative clauses than in subject relative clauses (hence the positive coefficient for the interaction,
which weakens the frequency effect). The POS tag was no
significant predictor for reading time on this region, presumably because its contribution is already explained by length
and frequency and their interaction.
We also found effects for word length (longer words take
longer to read), and transitional probability (words with high
transitional probability are read faster than words with low
transitional probability). This effect occurred in addition to
the RC type effect, which means that longer reading times
on the non-subject relative clause verbs cannot simply be explained by a lower predictability of the word, but suggests
that the linguistic structure makes a distinct contribution. Two
more interactions were significant: the interaction between
word length and landing position on the word, as well as an
interaction between word frequency and word length (short
words are typically more frequent than longer ones).
Our model explains a reasonably large proportion of the
variance in the data, the value for adjusted R-squared (which
also takes into account the number of degrees of freedom) is
15.6%.
The findings for first fixation duration and first pass duration are almost identical. The main difference between those
early measures and total reading times is that transitional
probability and word landing position do not come out as significant predictors for first fixation and first pass times.

Dependent Variables Each word in the data set is associated with the following eye-tracking measures: first fixation
duration, total fixation duration, and a binary value that marks
whether a word was fixated or skipped.
The first fixation duration of a region is the time that was
spent on the first fixation on that region before any word further to the right was fixated. First fixation duration is zero if
the region was first skipped and then regressed to later. The
first pass duration is similar to first fixation duration, the difference being that all fixations on a word that occurred before
any word to the right was fixated are summed up. Finally, the
total fixation duration is the sum of the durations of all fixation on a region.
Each of these measures was taken as the dependent variable
in a separate regression analysis. Because there is a fundamental difference between fixated and skipped words (i.e., it
is not easy to justify why a skipped word would be interpretable on a linear scale (its reading time is 0) and comparable to fixated words), we performed linear regressions on the
reading times for the fixated verbs (1886 verbs for first fixation durations, 2220 verbs for total fixation durations), and a
separate logistic regression (with dependent variable fixated
vs. skipped) for whole set of 3007 verbs.

Logistic Regression for Skipped Words Skipping probabilities are almost identical for subject and non-subject relative clauses: they amount to about 36% for first pass skipping
(i.e., the word is skipped before a word to the right is fixated)

Regression Procedure For each of the continuous dependent variables (total time, first fixation, first pass), we built
separate linear mixed effect models that included the eight

Method
Data and Procedure We used the same relative clause data
from the Dundee Corpus as in the first experiment. Also the
regression technique was the same.
Selection Criteria The relative pronoun and the first two
words immediately following it were extracted from the 4340
relative clauses. As in the first experiment, all data points
where the critical region (any of the relative pronoun or the
two following words) was located the beginning or end of
the line when presented on the screen were removed from the
data set, as well as all critical regions that included words
with any kind of punctuation. Again, we excluded all data
points that were in a region of four or more adjacent words
that had not been fixated, and all pronouns that had auxiliaries
attached to them (e.g. that’ll, who’d). We computed the reading times on for regions R1 and R2 and the relative pronoun
for each item and each subject (3067 data points in total).

verb region.

Independent Variables The relative pronoun had the following variables associated with it: pronoun identity (who,
that, which), subject ID, word length, fixation landing position, logarithm of the word frequency, logarithm of the transitional probability, and RC type. The first and second word
following the relative pronoun were each associated with the
following variables: word length, logarithm of the word frequency, POS tag of the word, transitional probability, and
landing position. Furthermore, the information from the relative pronoun and from the other word in the critical region are
also entered into the regression. In the tables, any variables
that refer to the first word are marked ‘.1’ while all those that
refer to the second word are marked ‘.2’.
In the critical region, POS tag and RC type are strongly associated: the words that follow the pronoun in the non-subject
RC are always noun phrases, while SRCs begin with verb
phrases. Thus, the length and frequency distributions of the
words in R1 and R2 are quite different: The first word of
the NSRC is often a short and frequent determiner or personal pronoun, whereas SRCs begin with auxiliaries, modals
or main verbs (see Table 4). For a list of the POS that occur
for both RC types, see Table 3. Also, the POS tags of the first
and second word of the RC depend on each other, since they
are often part of the same constituent (NP or VP respectively).

and 25% for total skipping (i.e., the word is never fixated). We
ran a logistic regression for first pass skipping probabilities.
The significant predictors for word skipping were transitional
probability, word frequency, and word length.

Discussion
Our results provide evidence for DLT, which predicts that
verbs in SRCs are processed more quickly than verbs in
NSRCs, due to lower integration costs. In addition, we also
find a significant effect of forward transitional probability in
this region. Since the inclusion of the transitional probability factor into the model did not cause the RC type effect
to disappear, we conclude that these factors explain different
proportions of the variance in reading times, and that the two
effects are largely independent (the correlation coefficient between transitional probability and RT type predictors is only
−0.073).
As expected, a significant proportion of the data is also explained by low-level factors such as length, frequency, and
fixation landing position and their interactions. As a single
predictor, RT type accounts for about 3% of the variance, and
RT type together with its interaction with frequency accounts
for 10.5% of the variance. On the other hand, transitional
forward probability explains 7.8% of the variance by itself.
The low-level effects length, word landing position, word frequency and their interactions account for 14.4% of the variance. All of these numbers refer to regressions with subject
as an error term.

Dependent Variables Again, each word in the critical region is associated with the following measures: first fixation
duration, first pass duration, total fixation duration, and a binary value that marks whether a word was fixated or skipped.
Each of these measures was taken as the dependent variable
in a separate regression analysis.

Experiment 2: Relative Pronoun Regions

Results
Relative Pronoun We calculated a minimal model (according to the AIC measure) that explains ≈ 7% of the variance.
The best predictors for reading time in this model are RC
type (p = 0.04), fixation landing position, transitional probability from the previous word to the pronoun, transitional
probability from the pronoun to the next word, and pronoun
identity. Furthermore, we found interactions between fixation
landing position and pronoun identity (which also coincides
with word length), as well as between pronoun identity and
transitional probability.

The aim of this experiment was to test a second prediction
of DLT with respect to the processing complexity of relative clauses: SRCs should incur a higher processing cost than
NSRCs on the word following the relative pronouns (regions
R1 and R2 in (1)). In addition to comparing reading times
on R1 and R2, we also tested for effects on the relative pronouns (where DLT predicts an SRC/NSRC difference, see (3)
and (4)), and on the second word following the relative pronoun, where spillover effects from R1 and R2 can be expected.

In a single predictor analysis, relative pronouns were read
more quickly in the SRC condition than in the NSRC condition (p < 0.001), but this effect was more extreme for the
relative pronouns which and who than for that, which is read
fast in the NSRC condition as well. A possible explanation for
this effect is that the word sequence that NP is more frequent
than which/who NP due to the ambiguity of that. We found
no general effect for RC type in first fixation and first pass
measures in the pronoun region, but also the same effect of
faster reading of that in the NSRC condition (although pronoun frequency and transitional probabilities were included
as independent variables in the model).
Skipping Skipping of the relative pronoun is more frequent
in the SRC condition than in the NSRC condition: first pass
skipping probability was 60% for SRCs but only 45% for
NSRCs. A similar contrast was found in total skipping, which
was 46% for SRCs and 33% for NSRCs. We investigated a
number of hypotheses to explain this early skipping effect:
1. Relative pronouns have different distributions for SRCs
and NSRCs: who typically occurs with SRCs, and may be
skipped more often as it is shorter than the other pronoun.
We would then expect pronoun type to be a good predictor
for skipping probability.
2. In SRCs, the first word after the relative pronoun is on average longer than the first word of an NSRC. Low level perceptual processes might thus cause saccades to the longer
word directly, skipping the relative pronoun. We would
then expect the length of the next word to be a good predictor for skipping.

Table 3: Regression coefficients and their significance levels
for a minimal model of total reading time for the first word
following the relative pronoun.

3. SRCs and NSRCs might differ in predictability from the
word before the relative pronoun. The more predictable the
relative pronoun is, the more probable it is to be skipped.
We would therefore expect the pronoun’s transitional probability to be a good predictor for skipping.

quickly in the NSRC condition than in the SRC condition, see
the coefficients in Table 3.1
For first fixation times, only two of our independent variables were found to be significant predictors: word frequency
(p < 0.01) and RC type (p < 0.0001, reading times for SRCs
are again longer). Together with the inter-subject random effect, these two predictors explain 11% of the variance in first
fixation reading times. The hypothesis that the RC type effect
be due to differences in word length is not confirmed by the
regression model, as length in not a significant predictor for
first fixation times.
For the second word after the relative pronoun, we did not
find any significant correlation with relative clause type. We
found that 16.5% of the variance for total reading times is
explained by a model that includes word length (p < 0.0001),
word frequency, transitional probability (all p < 0.01) and the
interaction between transitional probability and word length,
and frequency and word length (both p < 0.0001).

Our data support hypothesis 2: For both regression methods,
skipping is significantly predicted by the length of the first
word of the relative clause: The longer that word, the higher
the probability of the relative pronoun to be skipped. Transitional probability was not a significant predictor, and pronoun
identity was significant according to method 3 from Lorch &
Myers (1990), but not according to the mixed effects method.
However, RC type persists as a significant predictor (p =
0.01) for skipping even under this alternative explanation.
This indicates that low level processes involving word length
cannot fully explain the skipping of relative pronouns, and
that the effect of RC type should be a topic for future research.
Post-Relative Pronoun The significant predictors for total reading times for the first word after the relative pronoun
are frequency and length of that word, as well as the landing
position, especially in interaction with word length. We also
found that word length and frequency of the following word
were significant predictors, as well as RC type and the word’s
POS tag (see Table 3).
POS tag of the first word and RC type were entered as an
interaction into the regression, because the POS tags form
two exclusive sets with respect to their RC type. We found
that after accounting for the variance that is due to frequency
and length effects, the critical region was generally read more

1 When removing the variable for the POS of the first word from
the regression equation, model fit is a little lower. Highly significant factors in the model (p < 0.001) are RC type (longer reading times for subject RCs), transitional probability, frequency and
length of the first word, as well as the interactions between RC type
and transitional probability, RC type and frequency, frequency and
word length, and landing position and length. Typical factors like
frequency and transitional probability do not come up in the regression that involves POS tags, because their contribution to the variance is already explained by the word’s POS (e.g., determiners are
shorter and more frequent than adjectives).

relative clauses. The complexity effect manifests itself in two
distinct regions in the relative clause, leading to elevated reading times in these regions, as predicted by DLT. We also
showed that transitional probability (McDonald & Shillcock,
2003b) has an effect on reading time in these regions, independent of the DLT effect.
To our knowledge, this is the first time a theory of sentence
processing has been tested on data from an eye-tracking corpus. While we have only dealt with one construction (relative
clauses) and one theory (DLT), we believe that our corpusbased approach constitutes an important new methodology
for evaluating models of sentence processing, and we plan to
evaluate other models (e.g. surprisal, Hale 2001). Such models are currently tested exclusively on data obtained for isolated, manually constructed sentences in controlled lab experiments. The validity of the models can be enhanced considerable if we are able to show that they scale up to model reading
data from an eye-tracking corpus of naturally occurring text.

word length and their significance levels for the first word

Skipping For skipping probabilities on the first and second words after the relative pronoun, we find frequency and
length to be the significant predictors: shorter and more frequent words (which occur frequently in the NSRC condition,
see Table 4) were skipped more often, and skipping was also
highly dependent on whether the previous word had been
skipped.
Regressions to the first word are more probable in NSRCs
than in SRCs (although the difference does not reach significance level). We found regressions to mainly depend on
the word’s frequency, earlier skipping and the predictability
of the following word. If the following word had a low predictability, regressions are more probable.

We found increased reading times on the word directly following the relative pronoun for SRCs compared to NSRCs.
This is consistent with the predictions of DLT, which assumes
an increased integration cost for SRCs on this region. There
was no spillover effect on the following region (the second
word of the relative clause). We also tested for effects on
the relative pronoun itself, and found that this region is read
faster in SRCs than in NSRCs. Also, relative pronouns are
skipped more often for SRCs. This is a new effect that is not
readily predicted by DLT. However, a tentative explanation
maybe that the word following the relative pronoun is on average longer for SRCs than for NSRCs. This might explain
the greater tendency to skip the pronoun, perhaps because of
parafoveal preview of the next word.
Transitional probability was a significant predictor in the
region following the relative pronoun only when POS-tags
were not entered into the regression. On the spillover region (the second word following the relative pronoun) and
on the relative pronoun itself, we found effects of RC type
and transitional probability. Overall, these findings indicated
that transitional probability cannot serve as an alternative (but
as an additional) explanation of the DLT effect we found.
In this context, is interesting to note that Hale’s (2001)
surprisal model makes opposite predictions for the word following the relative pronoun: in NSRCs, this region should
be read more slowly, because the probability encountering a
noun phrase following the relative pronoun is smaller than
that of encountering a verb.

Conclusions
In this paper, we tested a theory of processing complexity,
Gibson’s (1998; 2000) Dependency Locality Theory (DLT),
against reading time data extracted from a large eye-tracking
corpus. We were able to show that DLT correctly predicts differences in processing complexity for subject and non-subject
