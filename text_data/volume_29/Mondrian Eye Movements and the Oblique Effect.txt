Abstract
Observers prefer paintings by Piet Mondrian in their
original orientation compared to when rotated – “The
Oblique Effect” (Latto et al., 2000). We tested whether eye
movements could provide any insight into this aesthetic
bias. We presented 8 Mondrian paintings (1921-1944) on a
computer monitor in their original and seven rotated
positions to 10 observers. These 64 images were randomly
presented for 20 sec each while recording eye movement
duration and saccade length. During a 5 sec ISI observers
used a 1-7 Likert-scale to report how (dis)pleasing they
found each image. In 6 cases an original orientation was
judged as significantly more pleasing than a rotated image,
while a rotated image was preferred in 3 cases. Overall,
over the 20 sec trial interval, fixation durations increased
linearly, while fixation duration increased more for pleasing
than for non-pleasing images. Moreover, saccade distances
oscillated over the viewing interval; with the pleasing image
fit being more variable (i.e., saccade distance oscillations
were larger) than the non-pleasing image fit. Both these
findings agree with earlier work by Nodine, Lochear and
colleague; and suggest that the more pleasing an abstract
painting is, the greater the diversive/specific types of image
exploration become (Berlyne, 1971).

Introduction
The psychophysical ‘oblique effect’, first named by Stuart
Appelle (1972), is the principle that “our perception of
oblique or diagonal lines is slightly inferior to our
perception of horizontal and vertical lines” (Latto et al.,
2000). Perhaps the earliest mention of the oblique effect in
the vision literature was cited by Mach (1861) who found
that observers were more accurate at matching a line parallel
to a horizontal or vertical comparison line than to an oblique
line (Mach 1861, cited in Westheimer 2003). Higgins and
Stultz (1949) also found that observers showed 20% higher
visual acuity when lines passing through their visual field
were horizontal or vertical as compared to oblique lines. In
2000, Latto and colleagues studied a related phenomenon
that they also called “The Oblique Effect”. They showed
that observers preferred eight paintings by Mondrian in their
original orientation compared to when they were rotated to
one of seven positions in 450 increments. They also found
an interaction between frame orientation and component
orientation such that the preference for horizontal and
vertical components was balanced by a preference for

components that were parallel to the surround frame.
Observers preferred images that had original horizontal and
vertical frames to those that had original oblique frames
because their components were parallel to the surround
frame. They concluded that there were two factors that
reduced the appeal of Mondrian paintings; one being
rotation per se, and how that might have affected the overall
balance of the painting and the other was the introduction of
obliquely oriented components.
Latto et al. (2000) compared the oblique effect to
orientational anistropy where perceptual discrimination is
slightly inferior in the oblique orientation and instead
observers prefer the vertical and horizontal orientation of
stimuli, such as lines in a vernier acuity task. The purpose
of the present study was to replicate Latto et al.’s (2000)
findings, while also determining whether eye movements
could provide any insight into the causes that might underlie
this aesthetic bias, since orientational anisotropy is often
considered to be due to a low-level process.
Mondrian felt so strongly that he should use only
horizontal and vertical lines, that when a fellow artist of the
movement, Theo van Doesburg, insisted on using diagonals,
Mondrian broke off their friendship and left the de Stijl art
movement which he helped to found (Esman, 1994).
By examining eye movement patterns, in particular
fixation durations and saccade extent, we can establish
whether Berlyne’s (1971) hypothesis that greater
diversive/specific types of image exploration occur as
images become more aesthetically pleasing. That is, we can
determine whether observers will have longer dwell times
over the viewing duration of a painting if it is seen as
interesting versus if it is seen as not interesting. Moreover,
we can determine if saccade length will show greater
fluctuations for pleasing images, indicating shifts between
diversive and specific viewing. Using the abstract work of
Mondrian is especially conducive to these measures in that,
unlike a realistic image, the painting can be rotated and still
be interpreted as a coherent work of art.
Much of the research to date on aesthetics and
psychology has focused on high-level cognitive
contributions. Even the use of lower-level eye-movement
measurements has contributed only by showing how having
an increase in such movements correlate to an increase in
information contained within the image (Antes, 1974;
Hochberg, 1976). By using Mondrian’s abstract work, the
information content is minimized as a variable, while
rotating such images holds constant whatever information
content that is present. Using eye movement recordings in
this way emphasizes whatever lower-level contributions are
relevant to making aesthetic judgments.

Method
We presented 8 abstract Mondrian paintings (19211944); 4 with traditional horizontal and vertical frames
(16.30 X 16.30) and 4 with oblique frames (22.60 X 22.60);
on a 21” computer monitor in either their original or 7
rotated positions (i.e., 00, 450, 900, 1350, 1800, 2250, 2700
and 3150; see Figure 1 for one example) to 10 observers
(introductory psychology students, who participated in the
one hour experiment for course credit. None of the students
were familiar with the works of Mondrian nor any of these
specific paintings. There were 6 males and 4 females, with
an average age of 19. They were not aware of the purpose
of the experiment).

These 64 images were randomly presented for 20 seconds
each while recording eye movement duration and saccade
length using an Applied Science Laboratories Model 501
Eye Tracker 6000 series. During a 5 sec ISI observers used
a 1-7 Likert-scale to verbally report how (dis)pleasing they
found each image.

Results
Pleasingness scores were normalized as z-scores.
Using these z-scores, we ran 8 paired-samples t-tests (1 for
each image) comparing each original image to all of its
rotations. From these t-tests we found 9 pairs of images (i.e.,
cases) that were statistically significantly different on
pleasing ratings from each other. Across the 10 observers
for the eight pictures and their seven rotations, in only 6
cases was an original orientation judged as statistically
significantly more pleasing than a rotated image, while a
rotated image was preferred in 3 cases. These images zscores are presented as cases in Figure 2. The fact that
statistical significance occurred in only a small number of
cases might be due to the fact that unlike Latto et al.’s
(2000) study, which had 30 observers view each image for 5
seconds, the current study used only 10 observers and had
them view each picture for 20 seconds while simultaneously
having their eye movements recorded.

We ran a 2x9x10 (pleasingness x cases x bins) repeated
measures ANOVA to look for patterns across the duration
of the scan. For our dependent measure we broke the
duration time of each image scan into 10 equal bins (10% of
fixations in each bin). Our independent measures were
average interfixation degrees (i.e., saccade extent) and
fixation durations for each observer. We then looked to see
what level polynomials were significant fits to the data, and
we plotted this trend line. We did this for all 18 images of
the 9 significant case-pairs. This allowed us to examine
patterns for each image, across the duration of each scan,

and compare the scanning pattern for original versus rotated
and preferred versus non-preferred images.
Overall, over the 20 sec trial interval, fixation durations
increased linearly (not exponentially as Hochberg (1976)
describes; see Figure 5), where images fixation duration
increased more for pleasing (Fig. 3a – solid line; y = 0.014x
+ 0.28; R2 = 0.51; p<0.002) than non-pleasing images (Fig.
3b – solid line; y = 0.004x + 0.32; R2 = 0.28; p<0.046).
These slopes were statistically significantly different (F(1,9)
= 5.792, p<0.039).
Moreover, saccade distances oscillated over the viewing
interval; with the pleasing image fit being more variable
(i.e., saccade distance oscillations were larger – Fig. 3a –
dashed line; R2 = 0.74) than the non-pleasing image fit (Fig.
3b – dashed line; R2 = 0.80). These effects were not
statically significant at the linear level, and only were
significant as a 5th order polynomial for the preferred
images and as a 4th order polynomial for the non-preferred
images.
Such a discovery could not be predicted by simply
examining the overall pattern of eye movements. This is
because each observer’s eye movement patterns were
unique to each orientation of a specific Mondrian (e.g., note
the pronounced differences across the 8 images in Figure 1).
This was true when comparing the data sets across all 10
observers (Figure 4 provides one example). Two facts are
made evident in Figure 4. First, the patterns of fixations
differ. That is, in the original orientation the overall pattern
of fixations lies across a broad 450 diagonal, but in the
rotated version the bulk of the fixations form a tilted Lshape, following the oblique orientation of the two main
black lines – but predominately lying within the larger white
diamond. This can also been seen in Figure 1. This
indicates that observers are indeed influenced by the
orientation of the painting, where the black lines can have
either more or less of an effect.
The second point is that there are no fixations in the
original Mondrian’s upper-left yellow square! Note that the

observer in Figure 1 also did not fixate on the yellow square
in five of the eight images. This is dramatic in that it is one
of the few colored regions making it likely to draw
exogenous attention to itself, and therefore should attract
eye movements. Findings such as these were found in
several eye scans of different paintings (both in their
original and rotated positions). This suggests that while
observers were sensitive to some elements of the pictures
(e.g., the oblique black lines in Figure 4’s rotated picture),
other elements were neglected (e.g, the yellow square in the
original image). Thus, viewing the pictures was not driven
solely by saliency.

Discussion

1447

Both of the eye movement patterns exhibited in Figure 3 fixation durations and saccade extent - agree with earlier
work by Nodine, Lochear and colleague; and suggest that
the more pleasing an abstract painting is, the greater the
diversive/specific types of image exploration become
(Berlyne, 1971). This can be seen by the progressively
longer fixation durations across the 20 second viewing time,
with this parameter enhanced when the pictures were
pleasing compared to when they were non-pleasing. It can

also be seen by having greater saccade oscillations present
with pleasing versus non-pleasing pictures.
Hochberg (1976) analyzed Antes (1974) eye movement
patterns made using realistic images. He did this to try and
better understand how eye movement patterns related to the
extent an image contained extractable information. While
the current findings are in agreement with Hochberg’s
analysis of fixation duration (e.g., compare the solid line in
Figure 5 to those in Figs. 3a & 3b), they do not agree with
his analysis of saccade extent, in that these did not gradually
decrease (e.g., compare dashed line in Figure 5 to those in
Figs. 3a & 3b). This may be due to the abstract nature of
the Mondrians, as opposed to data collected using Antes
(1974) realistic works (e.g., Fig. 6).
Antes (1974) work compared regions the viewer found
interesting (as noted in Figure 6’s numbers on the divided
lower image) to dwell times. Using this method he found
some exciting correlations. That is, more interesting
(informative) portions of the pictures received longer dwell
times. However, we did not ask observers to designate
“regions of interest” (i.e., rate informativeness). This is
because with Mondrian’s abstract work we did not
anticipate it would be possible to discern which regions
would be considered of particular interest, other than black
lines and color-filled regions. However, the above finding
that the upper left yellow square (Figure 4; and also in
Figure 1) was not fixated by any observer suggests that we
revisit this question in future studies. Moreover, it is clear
that the rotation of each Mondrian has a pronounced effect
on the pattern of fixations each observer exhibits (e.g., Figs.
1 & 4). This indicates that bottom-up processes may
account for the majority of the patterns generated,
something that could not be discerned using only realistic
pictures in the original rotation.
