statically significant at the linear level, and only were
significant as a 5th order polynomial for the preferred
images and as a 4th order polynomial for the non-preferred
images.
   Such a discovery could not be predicted by simply
examining the overall pattern of eye movements. This is
because each observer’s eye movement patterns were
unique to each orientation of a specific Mondrian (e.g., note
the pronounced differences across the 8 images in Figure 1).                                                                                       Figure 4. Fixations for 10 observers on an original (left) and

   Hochberg (1976) analyzed Antes (1974) eye movement
patterns made using realistic images. He did this to try and
better understand how eye movement patterns related to the
extent an image contained extractable information. While
the current findings are in agreement with Hochberg’s
analysis of fixation duration (e.g., compare the solid line in
Figure 5 to those in Figs. 3a & 3b), they do not agree with
his analysis of saccade extent, in that these did not gradually
decrease (e.g., compare dashed line in Figure 5 to those in
Figs. 3a & 3b). This may be due to the abstract nature of
the Mondrians, as opposed to data collected using Antes
(1974) realistic works (e.g., Fig. 6).
   Antes (1974) work compared regions the viewer found
interesting (as noted in Figure 6’s numbers on the divided
lower image) to dwell times. Using this method he found
some exciting correlations. That is, more interesting
(informative) portions of the pictures received longer dwell
times. However, we did not ask observers to designate               Figure 6. Morning on the Cape by Leon Kroll, as used by
