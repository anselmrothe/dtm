   Curve fit estimation for a linear regression of imitation
against the number of visible neighbors yielded a significant
positive relationship (β=0.794, F=8.501, df=6, p<.05) (see
Figure 4). Interestingly, a similar analysis of final scores in
each condition did not yield a significant linear relationship,
but a significant quadratic relationship was apparent which
peaked at NN=4 (β1=3.195, β2=-3.259, F=10.346, df=7,
p<.05) (see Figure 5).
   The same data were averaged across all participants in
each game to give dependent variable measures for each
round and all values of game order and group size. Linear
regressions were run on the round data for each dependent
variable. Analysis of score vs. round showed a slightly
positive but nonsignificant relationship for sessions with
one participant, and a strongly significant result for all other
group sizes (see Figure 6): in the aggregate, scores in groups
with between 2 and 8 participants showed a positive linear
relationship (β=0.966, F=137.525, df=11, p<.001).
Similarly, a slightly negative but nonsignificant relationship         Figure 5. Quadratic regression of final score vs. the number

participant, and a strongly significant trend for all other
group sizes (see Figure 7): turnover rates in groups of
between 2 and 8 participants showed a strongly positive
linear relationship to round number (β=-0.979, F=210.612,
df=10, p<.001). These results seem to indicate a general
difference in guessing behavior between isolated individuals
and groups. A significant negative trend was found for
imitation rate vs. round (see Figure 8): participants tended to
imitate less as each game progressed (β=-0.884, F=32.805,
df=10, p<.001).

                                                               unaffected by the availability of score information, which
                                                               seems to indicate that at least in this paradigm, this
