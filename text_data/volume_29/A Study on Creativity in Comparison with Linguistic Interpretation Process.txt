        Classification             Classification standard and example
     Property mapping              This category corresponds to “property mapping”. Properties of one noun are mapped onto the
                                   other noun. One can say that A is like B (absolutely B, and a new kind of B) or B is like A.
                                   (Example from an interpretation task: “a squirrel that doesn’t move at all” for stone squirrel )
                                   (Example from a design task: “A broom with a handle curved like a snake. It is useful for
                                   cleaning inner spaces.” for snake broom)
           Blending                This category corresponds to “hybrid”. Something can have the properties of both A and B yet
                                   be neither A nor B. One can say it is both A and B.
                                   (Example from an interpretation task: “a creature sharing properties of both a deer and an ele-
                                   phant” for deer elephant)
                                   (Example from a design task: “It is a computer virus that hardens various applications into stone
                                   (that is, it causes various applications to crash). It transmits important information in the com-
                                   puter to the hacker like a squirrel taking an acorn home to its nest” for stone squirrel)
      Thematic relation            This category corresponds to “relation linking”. The two nouns are combined from the viewpoint
                                   of a thematic scene. (Example from an interpretation task: “cage for deer” for deer box)
                                   (Example from a design task: “It is a defense system shaped like a skunk to prevent car break-ins.
                                   It is set up in an obvious place within the car. It puts a criminal out of action by emitting a gas
                                   that irritates the eyes and nose.” for skunk car)
              Other                Cases that do not fit into any of the other three categories.
                                   (Example from an interpretation task: “shooting star” for stone pony)
                                   (Example from a design task: “a machine that display a vision of fishes” for fish elephant)
