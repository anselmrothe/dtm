Koenig, 2006; Ojima, Nakata, Kakigi, 2005).
Developmental research has revealed the emergence of
adult-like patterns of brain activity during lexical
processing from 13 to 20 months. Additionally, research in
adults finds evidence for rapid neural change due to word
learning in both L2 and L1. For example, McLaughlin and
colleagues (2004) find that a few months of college
language instruction can yield brain responses to L2 words
in a lexical decision task that are indistinguishable from
native speakers of the same language.
This work
demonstrates that changes in neural activation reflect
lexical acquisition and that the brain appears to process
word meanings that are acquired in adulthood and
childhood similarly -- even though the adults in this study
did not show native-like behavioral performance. L1 word
learning also can result in rapid neural change (Perfetti,
Wlotko & Hart, 2005; Mestres-Missé, Rodriguez-Fornells
& Münte, in press). For example, Mestres-Missé and
colleagues (in press) found that three presentations of a
novel word in meaningful sentence contexts can result in
significant change in neural responses to words.
These ERP studies of word learning have focused upon
one particular brainwave component, the N400. The N400
is a negative going wave with a centroparietal maximum
that peaks approximately 400ms after the onset of any
potentially meaningful stimulus (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980).
Its amplitude has been found to decrease when a word is
more expected or when features associated with its meaning
are more easily integrated within its surrounding context
(Kutas & Hillyard, 1980; Van Petten & Kutas, 1990;
Federmeier & Kutas, 1999). For example, Kutas and
Hillyard (1980) recorded brainwave responses to sentence
completions that were either congruent or incongruent with
the context of the preceding sentence. In a sentence like:
“I drink my coffee with cream and sugar” where the

Abstract
We examined contextual effects on word learning using
event-related brain potential (ERP) methodology. Adult
participants first read known and unknown novel words in
strongly and weakly constraining sentence contexts. Then,
to assess acquisition of word meaning, they rated the
plausibility of probe sentences in which these same words
served as objects of a transitive verb. Plausibility effects
were observed in the N400 component to the verb only
when the upcoming novel word object had initially
appeared in a strongly constraining context. These results
demonstrate differences in electrical brain activity related
to rapid, one-shot contextual word learning.
Keywords: word learning; N400, event-related brain
potentials; language learning

Introduction
Humans have an amazing ability to learn new words
throughout their lifespan. While there is an enormous
body of research on word learning, much of it has focused
either on the factors involved in early language learning
in children, or on second language learning in adults. As a
result, we know surprisingly little about word learning by
adults in their native language. In addition, much of what
is known about the neural and cognitive correlates of
word learning (in children) comes to us from studies
involving early object learning in explicit language
training paradigms. However, the majority of words that
we know are not objects and their meanings are not
learned explicitly. Instead, most new words are acquired
incidentally, via surrounding words in sentence contexts
(Nagy & Herman, 1987; Sternberg, 1987). The goal of
the present work is thus to study the cognitive and neural
underpinnings of incidental word learning by adults in
their native language. More specifically, in this study we
explore the role of contextual constraint in word learning
by measuring how an event-related brain potential (ERP)
component – the N400, can index knowledge of word
meaning and usage.

Background
Research on the neural mechanisms of word learning has
recently become a topic of much interest, especially for

119

being used appropriately. As reviewed above, words that
appear in plausible contexts typically show a reduced N400
when compared to those that appear in implausible
contexts. Thus it is possible to gauge how contextual
constraint influences acquisition of word meaning by
contrasting responses to subsequent plausible and
implausible usages of the word. Unlike prior work, in
which learning was inferred from changes in the response
to the novel word upon its repetition, we examine the
consequences of novel (noun) word “learning” on verb
processing in a sentence plausibility task. Thus, if the N400
amplitude to the verb is modulated by the acceptability of
the upcoming novel word as its object, we can infer that
some of its meaning was learned on its initial appearance.
We can further infer whether what is learned is more or less
precise from an interaction between the plausibility effect
and contextual constraint.

sentence ending was congruent given the sentence
context, the evoked N400 response was much lower than
to sentences like “I drank my coffee with cream and dog”
where the sentence completion was not congruent to the
sentence context. It has also been found that one of the
best predictors of N400 amplitude to words in sentential
context is cloze probability (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984).
Cloze probability is measured by determining the
probability that a particular word is given in a context on
a sentence completion task. For words with low cloze
probabilities, the N400 is large, and the N400 decreases
accordingly as cloze probability increases. This suggests
that the N400 is not only enhanced to semantically
anomalous words, but also is related to a word’s degree of
expectancy or ease of which its meaning may be
integrated with the surrounding context. Additionally, the
N400 for pronounceable nonwords is larger than that of
real words (or about the same as for low frequency
words), but is not present for true nonwords that do not
have orthographically legal spellings, or are
unpronounceable (Bentin, 1987; Kutas & Hillyard, 1980).
Therefore, N400 amplitude is associated with a word’s
meaningfulness in a given context, ranging from very
small in amplitude when a word is very easily integrated
or understood, to very large when the meaning of a word
is unknown.
Altogether, these findings suggest that the N400 is
likely to vary with the degree to which the meaning of a
newly encountered word is known. As described above,
N400 amplitude in second language learners is reduced
commensurate with experience with the second language
(McLaughlin, Osterhout & Kim, 2004). Mestres-Missé
and colleagues (in press) also reported that the N400
component amplitude changes as new words are
incrementally learned over several more progressively
constrained sentences, but this does not happen when the
contexts do not make sense of the word. It is therefore
likely that changes in contextual constraint may also
result in N400 changes that are associated with word
learning. In our task, we vary the degree to which a
single, precise meaning of a novel word can be predicted
from context by varying the cloze probability of the
context in which novel words appear. By comparing how
words are learned in strongly and weakly constrained
contexts, we can better understand how rapid changes in
neural activity associated with word learning are related
to knowledge of word meaning.
Additionally, unlike previous work, we gauge
successful word meaning acquisition in a task that does
not require identification of a word’s precise definition.
We believe that this more closely mimics natural
language learning as it is uncommon to generate an
explicit definition for a novel word. Instead, it is more
likely that in everyday context, subsequent usage and
comprehension of a novel word rely upon an appreciation
of its appropriate usage. Accordingly, in our task,
participants indicate whether novel words are and are not

Methods
Participants:
26 college students (9 M, 17 F) were given credit or paid
$7/hr for their participation. Ages ranged between 18-25
(mean: 19.8). All participants were right handed, native
English speakers, and had no significant exposure to
another language at least before the age of 12. Participants
reported no history of mental illness, learning disability,
language impairment, drug abuse, or neurological trauma.
All participants had normal hearing and normal (or
corrected to normal) vision. An additional 11 participated
but were not analyzed: 4 had excessive blinking or motion
artifact, 3 because of equipment failure or experimenter
error, and 4 reported a characteristic which disqualified
them from analysis (3 had significant second language
exposure as a child, 1 reported significant illicit drug use.)

Stimuli:
Two types of sentences were selected for the study: 1)
Context sentences, which provide strong and weak
constraint contexts for real and novel word targets; and 2)
Test sentences, which were very short sentences, following
the form “Pronoun – Transitive Verb – Article – Target
word”. 80 strongly constrained and 80 weakly constrained
Context sentences were selected from Federmeier and
Kutas (2005). Strongly constraining sentence contexts were
paired with the endings obtaining the highest cloze
probability, and these same 80 words were then paired with
the weakly constraining contexts to yield plausible, low
cloze probability endings. Each sentence pair was assigned
one of 80 pronounceable nonwords to serve as an alternate
ending for each sentence. This arrangement yielded four
main Context sentence conditions with 40 sentences each:
1) High constraint sentences with real word endings
(High/Real), 2) High constraint sentences with novel word
endings (High/Novel) 3) Low constraint sentences with
Real word endings (Low/Real) and 4) Low constraint
sentences with Novel word endings (Low/Novel) Table 1

The presentation of each sentence was preceded by a
series of crosses (500 ms duration with a stimulus-onsetasynchrony varying randomly between 300 and 800 ms) to
orient the participant toward the center of the screen.
Sentences were then presented one word at a time, each for
a duration of 200 milliseconds with a stimulus-onsetasynchrony of 500 milliseconds. Participants were asked to
minimize blinking and movement as much as possible
during sentence presentation. The final, target word
appeared on the screen for 1400 ms, and was immediately
followed by RSVP presentation of each plausibility
sentence. Each plausibility sentence was preceded by a
series of question marks (400ms duration with a stimulusonset asynchrony varying randomly between 100 and
300ms) to prepare the participant to make a plausibility
decision at the end of the sentence. Plausibility sentences
were presented with identical timing as context sentences,
with target words remaining on the screen for 1400ms.
Participants were asked to make their decision as soon as
possible after the appearance of each final target word in
the plausibility sentence. There was short break after every
40 sentences, about every 10 minutes. At the conclusion of
the recording session, participants were compensated and
debriefed.

condition.
Across all versions of the experiment,
sentence-final target words in the two constraint
conditions were counterbalanced, such that the same
sentence and target ending did not appear twice in any
version, but all possible combinations of sentence / target
word pairs appeared in all versions. The purpose of this
was to ensure that any differences in performance due to
the properties of the words were balanced out across
conditions.

Recording
Scalp potentials were continuously recorded from 26
geodesically arranged sites using an ElectroCap with tin
electrodes. A left mastoid reference was used. Potentials
were digitized at a sampling rate of 250 Hz and hardware
bandpass filter of 0.1-100Hz with Grass Amplifiers.
Impedances were kept below 5 kΩ. The ERPs were
stimulus-locked averages consisting of a 100-ms baseline
and a 920 post-stimulus interval.

In addition to each context sentence, four additional
Test sentences were created for each high/low constraint
sentence pair for use in a plausibility judgment task. Two
of these sentences presented an implausible usage of the
target word, and two were plausible. Plausibility of the
Test sentence contexts was confirmed in a separate
norming study, where participants rated each sentence and
target word combination for plausibility.
All four
sentences were used in each version, but not repeated, and
they were counterbalanced across all versions of the
study. Table 1 shows examples of Test sentence contexts
used for plausibility ratings.

Data Analysis:
Data were re-referenced offline to a average mastoid
reference. Trials contaminated by eye movements, blinks,
excessive muscle activity, or amplifier blocking were
rejected off-line before averaging. ERPs were computed for
epochs extending from 100 milliseconds before stimulus
onset to 920 milliseconds after stimulus onset. Averages of
artifact-free ERP trials were calculated for target words in
the four sentence-final conditions (High/Real, High/Novel,
Low/Real, Low/Novel) as well as to verbs in all four
plausibility
conditions
(Plaus/Real,
Plaus/Novel,
Implaus/Real, Implaus/Novel) after subtraction of the 100
millisecond pre-stimulus baseline.

Procedure:
Participants were tested in a single experimental session
conducted in a soundproof, electrically-shielded chamber
and were seated in a comfortable chair in front of a
monitor. Participants were instructed to read the context
sentences for comprehension and to do their best to try to
comprehend the sentence even when “nonsense” words
appeared on the screen. For the plausibility task, they
were instructed to decide if each real and novel word was
being used appropriately based upon how they had seen it
used previously. Participants were not instructed to
generate an explicit meaning for novel words, and the
pace of the task required decisions to be made quickly so
as to minimize explicit naming strategies.

Post-hoc Tukey pairwise analyses revealed that responses
to High and Low constraint Real words did not differ
from each other, but that Novel/Low words were less
accurate than all other conditions, and Novel/High words
differed from all other conditions except Real/Low.
Additional Tukey analyses revealed no differences in
accuracy between Novel words in both plausibility
conditions, and Real/Implausible words, but all other
combinations were different from each other. These
analyses were identical when conducted on arcsin
transformed percentages, suggesting these effects were
not driven by Real word accuracies being at ceiling.

words show a difference peaking around 400 ms (N400)
and largest at centro-parietal sites, while responses to Novel
words do not show a constraint difference in this time
region.
Additionally, in both Real and Novel target
conditions, an extended positivity (LPC) is observed for
High constraint items ranging from Central to Posterior
sites.

N400 amplitude was measured in a time period ranging
from 300 to 500 ms at four central electrode sites where
N400 effects are typically largest (RMCe, LMCe, MiCe,
MiPa). A (2 x 2) repeated measures ANOVA was carried
out on these measurements with factors of Word Type
(Real/Novel) and Constraint (High and Low). This analysis
revealed main effects of Constraint [F(1,25)=24.92
p<0.0001], Type [F(1,25)=22.44, p<0.0001], as well as a
Constraint x Type interaction [F(1,25)=23.45, p<0.0001].
Follow-up posthoc Tukey tests revealed that these effects
were driven by Real/High target endings being significantly
more positive than every other condition, with no other
condition differing from any other.
Since an extend LPC positivity was observed for words
of high constraint, a repeated measures (2x2) ANOVA was
conducted with factors of Word Type (Real and Novel) and
Constraint (High and Low) in a time period ranging from
500 to 700 ms at identical electrode sites previously used
for N400 analysis (RMCe, LMCe, MiCe and MiPa). This
revealed main effects of Constraint [F(1,25)=8.71
p=0.0068], with High constraint target words showing
greater positivity in this time-window, and a main effect of
Type [F(1,25)=14.34 p=0.0009], with Real words showing
greater overall positivity in this period. An Constraint x
Type interaction was also found [F(1,25)=14.18, p=0.0009].
Posthoc Tukey tests revealed that this Real/Low targets
were significantly more positive than any other condition in
this time window, but no other differences were observed.

A (2 x 2 x 2 x 2) ANOVA was carried out with factors of
Constraint (High and Low), WordType (Real and Novel),
Plausibility (Plausible and Implausible) and Accuracy
(Correct and Incorrect). However, this ANOVA analysis
revealed only a main effect of Accuracy [F(1,385)=31.85,
p< 0.0001], with Incorrect responses being slower than
Correct ones. No other main effects or interactions were
observed.

a plausibility judgment first becomes available.
Additionally, analysis at the verb avoids confounds due to
reduction in N400 amplitude associated with repetition of
the target word.
As can be seen from this figure,
difference waves to real words peak between 400 and 500
ms (N400) at central and parietal sites. This effect is also
seen in the Novel/High condition, but is not as large for
the Novel/Low condition.
N400 amplitude differences in plausibility were
measured in a time period ranging between 300 and
500ms across four centrally located electrodes (RMCE,
LMCE, MiCe, MiPa). A (2 x 2) repeated measures
ANOVA was carried out on these measurements with
factors of Word Type (Real and Novel) and Constraint
(High and Low). This analysis revealed no main effect of
Constraint [F(1,25)=2.74, p=0.10], or Type (F<1).
However, there was a Constraint x Type interaction
[F(1,25)=5.12, p=0.033].
Pairwise post-hoc Tukey
analyses revealed that difference waves were larger in
Novel/High than Novel/Low conditions, but no other
conditions differ from each other at alpha threshold of
0.05.

Discussion
In this study, we explored how novel word meanings can be
acquired from sentential contexts that are strongly or
weakly constraining. Knowledge of word meaning was
probed by plausibility judgment, rather than in a task that
encourages explicit naming of the novel word or
definitional strategies. The aim was to create a task in
which novel words are learned implicitly through
contextual use, as in natural language.

Novel targets. Event-related potentials at right-medial

plausible and implausible verbs in each condition. On the
right, spline-interpolated isovoltage topographic maps plot
the plausibility effect (Implausible-Plausible) from 300500ms in each condition.
In our task, the initial presentation of novel words in the
context of weakly and strongly constraining contexts,
unlike real words, did not yield constraint related
differences in N400 amplitude to the novel words per se.
The consequences of this single exposure, however, were
clearly evident in the N400 plausibility effect to the main

verb in the probe sentence that immediately followed.
N400 amplitudes to probe verbs were significantly
smaller if they could plausibly take the novel word as an
object than if they could not, but only if the novel word
had appeared in a highly constraining context. Although
the plausibility judgment was not required or given until
after the probe sentence, the N400 modulation to the verb
shows that it was “computed” as soon as it could be – at
the verb, and before the novel word’s second appearance.
Clearly, the representation of a novel word was shaped by
the initial context in which it occurred so as to influence
how it is subsequently understood. This is the first time
that changes in brain activity consequent to novel word
learning have been observed over such a short duration.
In sum, this study demonstrates differences in neural
activity and behavior due to rapid, single-shot, word
learning. We find that the context in which a novel word
appears matters – and that stronger constraints during
learning enhance an individual’s ability to judge a word’s
appropriate usage in subsequent contexts.
