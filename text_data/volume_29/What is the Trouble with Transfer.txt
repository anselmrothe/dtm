function to the linear function, was similar across the
treatment (log R2 = .95; lin R2 = .80) and control groups (log
R2 = .93, lin R2 = .82). In contrast, the groups differed
considerably in their posttest estimation patterns. Children in
the control groups continued to generate estimates that fit the
logarithmic function better than the linear one (log R2 = .91,
lin R2= .85). In contrast, children in the treatment groups
generated posttest estimates that fit the linear function
substantially better than the logarithmic one (lin R2= .96, log
R2 = .69).
Rate of Change To address the rate of change among the
four groups, we analyzed the performance of all children who
initially provided a logarithmic pattern of estimates and then
compared the estimates of the two control groups to the two
treatment groups on a trial-block to trial-block basis. We
assigned a 1 to the trial blocks of each child that were best fit
by the linear function and a 0 to the trial blocks that were best                         Figure 2: Rate of Change
