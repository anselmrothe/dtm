would mean the participants select a random subset of
possible features for comparison. Thus, a participant using
an unconstrained and early terminating feature search would
be likely to examine multiple points during any given trial
to determine if differences between stimuli exist at the
selected locations. “Different” judgments would require
fewer fixations overall because the search would terminate
when a difference was discovered. This pattern is similar to
the point-by-point comparison strategy, but no specific
points would receive more attention over time, nor would all
points be examined in the case of “same” judgments. If the
participants carried this strategy over to the transfer session,
they would continue to sample points for comparison but
would be less likely to effectively identify and rely on
diagnostic points.

Seventy-one students from the undergraduate population of
Mississippi State University were paid for their
participation. Participants were randomly assigned to one of
two training groups: difficult training, involving difficult
same/different judgments between similar stimuli, or easy
training, involving same/different judgments between
dissimilar stimuli. After the training session, all participants
were transferred to a discrimination task involving a novel
set of similar (i.e., difficult) stimuli. Data from 7
participants were excluded from analyses because of
relatively poor accuracy (below 80%) during the training
session. Additionally, 7 participants were excluded from
the eye movement analyses due to problems with equipment
calibration.
