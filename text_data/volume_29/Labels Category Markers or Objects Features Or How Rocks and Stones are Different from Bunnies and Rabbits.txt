Participants Participants in Experiment 1A were 27
undergraduate students (M = 19.85, SD = 1.05; 13 women
and 14 men) recruited from the introductory psychology                                          (A)
courses at Carnegie Mellon University.
Materials Materials in Experiment 1A consisted of eight
picture sets and sixteen label pairs. The picture sets were
comprised of four novel objects, one of which was
designated to be a Target and the rest were Test items, such
that Test 1 was highly similar to the Target, Test 2 was less
similar, and Test 3 was dissimilar from the Target. Half of
the picture sets were comprised of novel artificial objects
and the other half of novel natural kind-like stimuli (see
Figure 1 for examples of picture sets). The position of the
Test items relative to the Target item (directly below, below
and to the left, or below and to the right) was randomized
for each trial.
   Label pairs used in Experiment 1A consisted of eight
pairs of semantically similar labels with mean association                                      (B)
strength of 0.41 (in the Associated Semantically Similar
Labels condition) and eight pairs with mean association
strength of 0.03 (in the Non-associated Semantically Similar
Labels condition). The list of synonym pairs used in the
experiment is presented in Table 1.
