   The questions were written by the author and three research
assistants. Questions were divided into those regarding
“central” or “peripheral” interest in the scene (Rensink,
2000). The group collaborated in choosing whether to define
a certain question as regarding a central item or not, and in
case of disagreement the question was discarded and a new
one written.
   Three-alternative forced choice tests were also given for an
object from the scene, with all items sharing a conceptual
category but differing visually (see Figure 1).
