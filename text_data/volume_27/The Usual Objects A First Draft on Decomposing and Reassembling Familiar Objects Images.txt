Decomposition After regularization, the image borders are
more clean, and thus edge detection can be performed suc-
cessfully. But to maximize the opportunity of finding compo-
nents features the image is reflected, each of the two mirror
images are cut along the y-axis of symmetry, and two new
images are created (see Figure 1 for the RL(right-left) one).
Using Canny methods, that finds edges by looking for local

{{? iX }i≤n }X∈R is a family of n-ary operators, specifically
used to describe the object construction: R is a set of rela-

the algebra, we define a theory of 2D shapes based on three
sets of axioms: FG ∪ FF ∪ FC , which are the Grouping Ax-
ioms, Figure Axioms, and Connection Axioms. The Group-
ing Axioms are introduced to specify the properties of the
terms, the properties of the operators, and the properties of
connections, so as to exclude non valid connections, e.g. the
end points of a boundit with the side of a cylinder, inducing
shapes formed by components which are represented in dif-                           Figure 4: The set of possible Boundits
ferent dimensions, see Table 1. The grouping axioms are the
fundamental axioms of the algebra fixing the laws for build-
ing the figure terms. The Figure Axioms are used to specify
the shapes that can be obtained, by using primitives and oper-
ators. Finally, the Connection Axioms specify the metric over
the terms of the algebra, obtained introducing a notion of dis-
tance for each operator. Together with these axioms a set of
background knowledge axioms specify the way familiar ob-
