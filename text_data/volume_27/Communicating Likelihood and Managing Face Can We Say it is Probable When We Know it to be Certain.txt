    Alongside with each of the eight statements, partici-
pants were presented with 10 probabilities (introduced
in the form of percentages, from 10% up to 100%) and
had to judge to what extent the speaker may have had
this probability in mind when uttering the statement.
This judgment was expressed on a 10-point scale an-
chored at ‘absolutely not’ to the left and ‘absolutely’ to
the right. For example, after having read that ‘Eileen
tells you: You have probably made a big mistake’, par-
ticipants were asked the following question: ‘Can Eileen
think the probability that you have made a big mistake
is...’ followed by the 10 possibilities 10%, 20%, up to
100%, and had to provide a judgment for each of the
10 possibilities.2 The order of statements was coun-
terbalanced across questionnaires. Questionnaires were
filled out during class. Participation was optional and
anonymous, but participants had the option to provide
an email address so as to take part in a prize draw. Two
participants won a prize of £25 in vouchers. The exper-
iment was conducted in English.
