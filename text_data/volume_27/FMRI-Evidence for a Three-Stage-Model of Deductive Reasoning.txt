   The brain imaging data showed clearly distinguishable
brain activation patterns during the three phases of
deductive reasoning. First, as shown in Figure 1a, the
premise processing phase (contrast second premise minus
first premise) activated two large bilateral clusters of
activation in the occipito-temporal cortex (OTC). Second,
shown in Figure 1b, during the integration phase (contrast
second premise minus conclusion) these two clusters in the
OTC and an additional cluster in the anterior prefrontal
cortex (APFC) were activated. The latter covered parts of
the middle frontal (BA 10) and medial frontal gyrus (BA
32). Third, shown in Figure 1c, the validation phase
(contrast conclusion minus second premise) activated three
clusters, two in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and one in the
posterior parietal cortex. More precisely, the clusters in the          Figure 1. Brain activation during reasoning. The clusters

reasoning analyses). During the premise processing phase,
we found slightly elevated activations in OTC as we had
obtained during reasoning (compare Fig. 1a with 2a).
However, overall in this phase the patterns of activation
were quite similar. During presentation of the second
premise (premise maintenance phase), which now required
only premise maintenance but not integration, we again
found similar OTC activation, but significantly lower APFC
