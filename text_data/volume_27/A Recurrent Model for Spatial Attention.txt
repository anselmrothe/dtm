plicative interaction of independent variables is called gain-
field coding. Pouget and collaborators (Pouget & Sejnowski,
1997; Pouget & Snyder, 2000) suggested that parietal gain-
modulated neurons may serve as basis functions with which
the brain computes sensorimotor transformations. A popula-
tion of these neurons may provide a complete basis set for the
combined space allowing to approximate any arbitrary func-
tion of the input variables by taking a linear sum of their out-
puts (Poggio & Girosi, 1990). It follows that encoding space
with basis function units renders it possible to reduce non-
linear coordinate transformations to simple linear mappings.
The resulting basis function representation codes spatial lo-
cations in a format which contains implicitly any frame of
reference that can be derived from the input variables. For
instance, a basis function map combining visual information
with eye position may be used to compute target location in           Figure 1: Recurrent neural network model for saccadic plan-
