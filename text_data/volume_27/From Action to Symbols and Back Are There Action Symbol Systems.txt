global, procedural, implicit and not analytical, i.e. not based
upon single features (cf. Vigliocco, Vinson, Lewis & Garrett,
2004, for a thorough discussion), whereas combinatorial symbolic language relies on the combination of feature representations. In the case of ACSS, we should assume a representation
mapping that works bidirectionally, from action to language
and the converse. This bidirectional relationship is plausible
enough, and both ways of the relationship have received consideration also during the history of psychology (Piaget, 1952;
Luria, 1960, 1981).
When referring to “action” at least three different kinds of
processes, and presumably related representations, could be
involved: action visual recognition, action verbal description,
and action control (see Rizzolatti, Fogassi, and Gallese, 2001
for neural relationships between the first and the latter). Also,
there is a difference between how such representations are
acquired and how they are used. Different cognitive processes
are involved in these cases. When acquisition is concerned,
information must be extracted from a perceived action, associated with verbal labels. This is what children (or adults learning a second language) do when they learn the meaning of
words for actions, while observing or performing the action
and concurrently listening to a verbal description. In order to
develop a systematic vocabulary for features, they must ground
single words for features by constructing a consistent mapping
with observed or performed actions. In the case of acquisition,
then, to construct an ACSS means to associate perceptualmotor parts or components of action to separate representations. In contrast, according to a holistic view, representations
for action as global patterns could be constructed; their symbolic nature can be questioned, but in any case they do not
constitute a true symbol system.
In the case of use of representations for actions, there is a
difference between describing or executing actions. In a verbal
description task, it seems little efficient to have a symbol for
every possible action, and more useful to have an ACSS; on
the contrary, an automatic procedure that works holistically
could be more suitable in order to execute an action.
The above hypotheses need empirical support. In this paper
we present a new paradigm for testing such different aspects:
acquisition, execution, description, and compositional use of
representations for actions. In our paradigm the source of our
empirical data is both experimental and simulative, since we
used the same conditions with human subjects and neural networks. Neural networks are a good tool for investigating such
questions, because they can naturally implement non-symbolic
or analog representations.
In our research, we studied the acquisition and use of an artificial language denoting actions. We wanted to see what kind
of representations are developed if a systematic association is
established between meaningless motor and verbal stimuli. In

Abstract
We present an experimental and simulative method for exploring
the properties of symbolic action representation. This work is related to the current debate about the compositional vs. holistic
nature of such representation. We designed a new experimental
setup to be used with human participants and a neural network
model as well, in the context of an artificial language learning
whose referents are actions. In different conditions, (a) actions
are systematically connected with sentences made of arbitrary
words, following a simple syntax, and consistently expressing
features of involved movements; (b) actions as a whole are consistently associated with arbitrary words; (c) actions are consistently associated with other actions so that the former become
symbols for the latter. In such tasks, results show a clear advantage for a holistic representation; there are reasons, however, to
suppose this might be a first step towards a compositional representation. This analysis is supported by results with nets.

Introduction
Representations for concepts and actions are increasingly being considered as tightly connected. The study of embodied
cognition is assuming more and more theoretical significance
and a recent trend has emerged that questions the idea of a
mental concept representation made by the combination of
abstract, arbitrary, and amodal symbols, as the first cognitivist
stance had posited. Even if there are still models that insist on
symbolic abstract coding (e.g. Landauer & Dumais, 1997;
Burgess & Lund, 1997), many authors now claim that linguistic representation is modal and emphasise its analogical aspects. In some cases (Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg & Robertson,
2000; Chambers, Tanenhaus, Eberhard, Filip, & Carlson,
2002; Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002) the somewhat radical claim
is posed that the comprehension of sentences substantially
comes from the possibility of mentally simulating (or “reenacting”) the actual performance of implied actions.
Such perspectives substantially stress the role that internal
simulation of concrete action, with its nonarbitrary aspects, has
for comprehension of abstract representations. Barsalou
(1999), in particular, suggested that perceptual (and motor)
representations, even though modal, may have properties of
symbols like compositionality. This view (perceptual symbol
systems) to some extent also implies, conversely, a sort of perceptual-motor language; it still assumes that language can only
be understood by referring to actions but also that actions are
represented by the representation of their features.
Action representation can be considered as componential if
sequences of actions can systematically be combined and recombined according to represented rules. In this case it would
be possible to speak of action symbol systems (ACSS), i.e.
modal representations but with compositional properties. This
componential view of action representation may be opposed to
a holistic one, that considers representations for actions as

words arbitrarily paired to actions, body-parts, and sidespecifications. Words were nonsense syllables, i.e. triplets
made of a consonant, a vowel, and another consonant, avoiding phonetically confusable combinations. For group (b) bisyllables words were used in order to reduce the effect of associations with known words, more frequent with monosyllables.
An arbitrary subset including a half of the 18 possible movements resulting from the combination of movements with
body-parts and side-specifications was chosen as set 1, to be
used in the learning phase as explained later; the remaining
half was designated as set 2 (for test phases). A different set of
9 single words was also defined for denoting movements belonging to set 1. A simple syntax was defined for the artificial
language, as the first word always denoted the action, the second the body-part, the third the side (see tab.1; for example,
LOF DIN FIT indicates “wave the left forearm”; the same
movement could also be expressed by the single word TANEG). Note that subjects were Italian speakers and that this
sequence reflected the natural order of words in Italian. For
group (c), a different set of actions was designed for cueactions, systematically associated to features of target actions
(the same for all groups). Only the right forearm-hand (for the
subject) was used. The hand position could be open, clenched
fist or pointing; the forearm could be (already rotated before
the start of movement) showing the upper, lower or side part of
the hand; the movement from the starting position (hands side
by side) could be outwards or inwards the body. Features were
denoted as shown in table 1: e.g., hand up, pointing outwards,
means “wave the left forearm”.
All actions were videotaped and transformed into digital clips.
A sitting person was framed half-length, in front of the camera,
only the chest and the arms resting on a table were visible. The
starting position for each action was: elbows rested on the table
and arms still in extended position, open hands side by side
resting downwards (fig. 1). For actions to be presented along
with the corresponding verbal label, a male voice (realised by
using a vocal synthesis program) uttered the corresponding
sentence/word in the videoclip soundtrack. The voice started at
the same time when the movement started. For the first language training, as explained later, the voice uttered the sentence/word twice, while the corresponding written form was
presented in the centre of a white screen. In subsequent action
videoclips, the verbal stimulus was only in aural form in order
to ensure that visual attention was directed to the movements.
Each action in videoclips ended back at the starting position.

particular we intended to examine whether, if available, such
representations may have a modal and compositional nature at
the same time, as assumed by the ACSS hypothesis, and their
effectiveness for different tasks (description or execution of
actions).
We constructed a conceptual universe for actions made of
simple movements, systematically associated with a sentence
or a single word of an artificial language, or with a different
action that acted as a cue. Human participants and neural networks were then trained to associate simple arbitrary actions
with standard compositional symbols (words or other actions
systematically connected with features) or noncompositional
symbols (completely arbitrary words).
In the case of sentences, in establishing the connection between sentences and actions we strove to reproduce the natural
process of language learning, where arbitrary symbols are
combined following a syntax to systematically express featural
regularities. In natural contexts, words are not normally presented in an ordered form, one at a time, each associated with a
particular referent. This happens in symbol grounding by explicit teaching, like in our previous work (Cangelosi, Greco &
Harnad, 2000; Greco, Riga & Cangelosi, 2003) where we
simulated how the representation of abstract and arbitrary
symbols can ground higher-level abstract concepts. Actually,
language that describes what is happening is already syntactically structured, and the meaning of single words is inferred by
abstraction of perceived regularities.
In the case of cue-actions, they were systematically associated
to featural aspects of the target-actions set. In order to avoid a
direct connection and to allow a possible symbolic mapping,
correspondences between the two sets of movements were set
up in such a way that target movements were associated with the
hand position in the cue set (open, fist, pointing), the body part
involved was associated with a movement (outwards or inwards), and the side with the forearm position (upwards, downwards, sideways). Here it is tried to establish an arbitrary connection between movements, in such a way that the ones of the
first set may become systematic symbols for the second.

Experiment Method
Participants
36 students from the University of Genoa participated in this
study for course credit. They were run individually, randomly
and equally assigned to each condition: (a) actions-sentences;
(b) actions-words; (c) only actions.

Stimuli

Procedure

A conceptual universe was first defined including three possible actions (to tap, to raise, and to wave), two body parts (forearm, hand), and three side specifications (left, right, both). An
artificial language was then defined, that included a set of 8

1. Pre-training. In this phase, the 9 target actions belonging to
set 1 were used. Before engaging in the main tasks, participants
in groups (a) and (b) had to be familiarised with the artificial

had to produce the corresponding sentence, word, or cuemovement. The purpose was to test whether a bidirectional
connection had been established. Given the relative difficulty
of task and for ensuring a good base for proceeding with subsequent tasks, feedback was given also at this stage.
4. Transfer test. Only participants in group (a) and (c) had this
task. It was similar to the previous, but sentences never heard
before, or cue-movements never seen before, describing actions of set 2, never seen, were presented. No feedback was
given. The purpose was to test whether subjects had represented cues as single features and were able to use them combinatorially.
5. Inverse transfer test. It was similar to the previous, but
actions of set 2, never seen, were presented and subjects were
asked to give the corresponding cue. No feedback was given.
The purpose was again to test the combinatorial nature of their
representation.
6. Final test. This task required both a direct and inverse association. In the direct task, participants were given a pair of cues
(a sentence, two words, or two cue-movements) and had to
execute the corresponding two target movements; in the inverse task, they had to produce the cues from a pair of target
movements. For group (a) the sentence included 4 words that
expressed the two target movements in a more compact form
(e.g. GAB LOF DIN FIT for GAB DIN FIT and LOF DIN FIT), in
order to test whether subjects were able to construct higherorder combinations using the basic elements previously learnt.
Given that for group (a) this task implied a slight syntactical
modification, the first pair was always direct (so that the verbal
form or the cue was presented first) and was correspondingly
the same in all groups. 6 direct and 6 inverse pairs were presented in total, in random order.
7. Final debriefing. In order to have also a qualitative source
of data, upon completion of the procedure, participants were
fully debriefed. They were asked what strategies they had
adopted in learning and what difficulties they thought had encountered; participants in groups (a) and (b) were also asked
to describe in Italian what they thought the meaning of each
word was and the movements they had learnt.

Figure 1: The starting position of movements
language as a pure sequence of sounds associated, for more
clarity, with the written form. They were told they had to
learnsome sentences/words from an artificial language.
They had to look at each sentence/word, and had to repeat it
loud. Each stimulus duration was 5 sec, the set was presented in alphabetical order and repeated three times for
group (b). This pre-training had the goal of avoiding that
much attention be spent just in phonetic decoding in subsequent tasks.
In the pre-training second part subjects were made familiar
also with movements; after presentation of each movement
subjects were asked to simply repeat it; it was made clear that
they should exactly imitate the complete movement specularly,
as in front of a mirror. Participants in group (c) were orderly
shown and had to repeat the entire sets of cue and target actions; no break separated the two sets. Movements were always repeated in case of error at this stage, until a perfect execution.
2. Basic learning and test cycles. This phase consisted of a
series of cycles of Serial Learning, Interactive Learning, Basic
Test. In Serial Learning, the 9 target actions belonging to set 1
were presented, in such a order that each movement differed
from the previous just for one aspect. Participants in groups (a)
and (b) were instructed to watch movie clips and to repeat
movements and words, in group (c) they had to repeat the sequence of cue and target movements. In case of mistake, subjects were corrected and the stimulus was repeated. A bell
sound highlighted good or bad performance in order to enforce
learning. In the Interactive Learning, a screen with 9 buttons in
the upper part and a movie window in the lower part was
shown. Buttons were arranged in 3 x 3 array labelled with sentences (a), words (b), or icons depicting the start ing position of
the cue movements (c). The position of buttons was fixed and
the three movements were sorted by columns. Participants
could observe target actions in the movie window by clicking
with the mouse the corresponding cue-buttons, as many times
they wished and in any order. There was no time limit, they
were instructed to click the end button when they thought they
had learnt. This step had the purpose of allowing participants
learning at their pace and following their personal strategies.
Upon exit, a random test was performed (Basic Test). If, at the
test that ended a cycle, a participant did not reach a level of
performance success of 67 % (6 correct answers out of 9), a
new cycle was started, up to 3 cycles. In the first Serial Learning actions were presented sorted by movements, in the second
were sorted by body-part, in the third by body-side.
3. Inverse test. Participants of all three groups were presented,
in a new order, the target actions originally learned (set 1) and

Experiment Results
At the final debriefing emerged that, in general, subjects found
the task very difficult; they often tried to resort to associations
with words, images, and whatever could help from daily life.
This normally happens when using meaningless material. A
number of participants in groups (a) and (c) had some insight
about certain associations, but almost none of them was aware
of a clear and systematic framework.
The mean number of learning cycles was 4,55 for group (a),
3,51 for group (b) , and 5,71 for group (c), showing that learning resulted easier for group (b). The mean number of repetitions in the Interactive Learning phase was: (a) 76,69; (b)
133,27; (c) 144,14. This may have happened because in (b)
condition subjects presumably spent much more time in search
for a rule, or because they exercised more being aware that the
best strategy was rote memorisation.

towards a compositional system. In doing so, a negative factor
may have been the greater confusability between different sentences (e.g. GAB DIN FIT vs. GAB DIN NUV) whereas single
words were of course well distinctive. Only when a true and
full systematisation has been reached the benefits of compositionality may start to be effective.
In the Inverse Test the proportion of correct verbal descriptions of the seen movement has been sensibly poorer than the
BT result in condition (a) (t=.00000071 p < 0.05) but not in
condition (b) (t=.11). This may be due to a well-known effect
in language learning, i.e. that description is more difficult than
execution (competence comes before production). If actions
were represented as a whole also in group (a), it is also possible that this hindered the composition of a sentence, whereas
this did not happen in condition (b), where it’s a matter of a
simple bidirectional global link. This happened also in condition (c), where the cue-movement should have been retrieved
given the target.
Results for The Transfer Test and the Inverse Transfer Test
do not reach statistical significance and are very poor for group
(c). This makes clear that, at least in the context of the present
research, subjects did not construct a coherent representation
system for component features of presented actions, the only
case that might have helped in transferring to new stimuli the
acquired knowledge. However, this happened in part in condition (a) and it probably could have been reached with a more
intensive training.
The Final Task confirms the trend of previous tasks. It is
more difficult because it includes both direct and inverse tests,
and in the case of group (a) subjects had also to learn a new
syntax. This task had been originally aimed at testing the capability of scaling-up, assembling symbols at a higher level, but
in many cases our subjects rather took it as a simple juxtaposing of previous responses; in a future revision of the present
work, we plan to change the target movents for this task and
use true composite actions.

Table 2 shows the proportion of correct responses for each
test condition. The overall best performance has been obtained
by group (b) subjects. In the direct test (Basic Test, BT) (a) and
(b) condition results were comparable (a .70; b .75), while in
(c) condition subjects found the task more difficult (.51). In the
Inverse Test (IT) subjects in group (b) shown better results
than the other groups; the result obtained at this test in (a) and
(c) conditions were worse than BT ones. Results in transfer
conditions (Transfer Test, TT; Inverse Transfer Test, ITT)
were not significant. The final direct test (FT) mirrored the
trend shown by the BT.

Experiment Discussion
In the hypothesis that the compositionality of symbols be
transferred to the internal representation, a more analytical
representation and the best overall performance was expected
in condition (a). In this case, the worst performance was expected in condition (b), because one single word for a relatively complex action should be more ambiguous than a featural description (e.g. it could be referring to the movements, or
the body part, etc.). In particular, subjects in group (a) should
have revealed above chance success in transfer tasks, where a
productive operation is involved of re-assembling symbols for
describing or executing new actions. In condition (c), if the
systematic symbolic association of cue actions worked as a
compositional system, we should have obtained results comparable to condition (a).
These predictions have not been confirmed by our results.
The main effect seems to support the hypothesis that when a
label is symbolically associated to an action as a whole (as in
condition b), it can predict better the associated movements
than when the symbol was a more complex code. At the first
direct execution test (BT) the performance in groups (a) and
(b) was comparable (Student’s t=.21 p < 0.05), hence the result
for condition (a) cannot be interpreted as being effect of the
treatment.
The poorer result for group (c) leads us to suppose that
representations corresponding to motor stimuli elicited both by
cue and target do not succeeded in connecting well into a
symbolic system, but suffered from a sort of reciprocal
interference. A testable hypothesis is that if cue and target
movements were more obviously related (i.e. target
movements had been predicted by other movements, positions
by other positions, and the target side by the cue side), then the
task would have been much more easier, but in this case
because of a motor, not symbolic, connection.
The advantage for group (b) reveals itself both in the direct
(execution) and inverse (description) tasks. A possible explanation is that in the other groups the greater number of combinations of cues, compared to a single one, make error more
likely just because they did not organise themselves into a true
system. The hypothesis may be formulated that, at least in the
(a) condition, two mechanisms might have worked concurrently, i.e. (1) a holistic representation in the first stance - similar to the one effective in the group (b), that may have lead to
some rote memorisation of composite sentences (or of parts of
them) as single arbitrary words, and (2) an initial organisation

Simulation Method
Network architecture
In order to execute the simulations of conditions carried out
with the subjects we chose to use a single feed-forward architecture built on 3 layers. An overall scheme of neural networks
architecture is displayed in figure 2, where arrows represents a
full connection between linked sets. Nets are equipped with 3
different types of input set: 1) a visual one for not-

818

Verbal stimuli and responses of group (a) were encoded by 4 bits
strings while verbal stimuli of group (b) were encoded by 8 bits
strings (for example “DIN” is encoded as “1011” and “LIBAC”
as “10110010”). Not-compositional visual stimuli were encoded
by 21 bits strings while every element of compositional ones (only
group (c)) were encoded by 2 bits strings. Motor output did not
use any code as explained in the previous paragraph. The only
difference between experiment with subjects and simulation concerns the final task, because it was necessary a short final training
(only 3 composed stimuli) in order to teach nets the correlation
between stimuli required by the final test.

compositional stimuli consisting of 21 binary units; 2) a second visual input for compositional stimuli composed of 3 sets,
each consisting of 2 binary units (each set represents one of
the compositional elements that constitute the cue stimuli of
group (c)); 3) a verbal input composed of 3 sets each containing 3 binary units (every set is representing one of the syllabic
words of group A; moreover the first 2 sets are able to represent the bisyllabic words of group (b). Input 2 and 3 have been
duplicated to emulate the sequence demanded for the development of the simulation of final test. Verbal output is a specular reproduction of verbal input, while the motor output is
composed of 20 binary units so distributed: 12 units reproduce
single target movements (the 6 movements executed with both
sides are represented by the activation of the respective nodes
of both sides) while the other 8 units reproduce the 8 cue
movements necessary for the descriptive purpose of the inverse tests. Likewise input units, it was necessary to duplicate
all output units in order to emulate the sequence required for
the final test.

Simulation Results
As for human participants, we expected also in the model that
if the compositionality of symbols is transferred to the internal
representation, a more analytical representation should be
formed in condition (a), respect to other conditions, with separate representations for semantic component features like forearm, to tap, etc. As in human subjects, results (Table 2) show a
better performance in the (b) condition; this obviously happened because the pattern was not composite so a linear association could be established. We can hypothesise that this was
exactly the reason why we had a similar result in human participants, namely a sort of cognitive economy, versus the advantage of a more costly analytic system that perhaps can reveal itself only after a longer training. A cluster analysis, performed on nets in condition (a), made clear that a structured
representation of verbal elements emerged.
Nets showed a clear-cut difference from subjects only in
condition (c), especially in transfer tests. This group of nets
showed both descriptive and execution capabilities because
more resources were available that could allow them to extract
features. This makes us suppose that presumably a more prolonged pre-training with human subjects could allow a better
feature extraction, which is a fundamental basis for a possible
subsequent construction of manipulable representations.

Figure 2: Network architecture
The hidden layer is composed of 14 nodes subdivided in 3
groups. A group is equipped of only 2 nodes, its task is to correlate visual inputs with verbal ones and it is employed in the
simulations for groups (a) and (b). The others two groups are
composed respectively of 5 and 7 units, which have to process
visual stimuli for imitation tasks. The group composed of 5
units controls the reproduction of movements to be carried out
with the right side, the other one controls those to be executed
with the left side. This distinction between the nodes that govern the motor stimuli is necessary because of the choice to
represent cue motor stimuli (group c) by only right hand and
forearm. The difference between the set that associates verbal
stimuli with motor stimuli and the one that associates motor
stimuli to other motor stimuli is due to the assumption that this
last task would have to be more difficult for subjects than other
ones.

General Discussion
The aim of this paper was to explore the possibility of action
system systems (ACSS) with the property of compositionality.
In two experimental conditions such symbols had a verbal
nature, in another condition they were just other actions used
as symbols. Verbal symbols were established by means of an
artificial language, in one case referring to features and in the
other case completely arbitrary. Neural networks may give the
opportunity to analyse more closely the kind of representation
involved. The process here may be somewhat similar to the
one involved in previous simulations of symbol grounding
(Cangelosi, Greco & Harnad, 2000; Greco, Riga & Cangelosi,
2003), where the “verbal” part of the architecture assumes a
symbolic function because it can transfer its grounding to new
perceptual stimuli.
The main questions our paradigm tried to answer were:
when actions are learnt by definition through a componential
language, capable of expressing featural aspects of component
movements, are componential representations correspondingly
created? In this case, are such representations used and helpful

Procedure
The learning procedure strictly followed the same steps considered in the experimental section. Nets were supervisioned
by a back-propagation algorithm with learning rate fixed to
0.60 and a momentum of 0.05. Networks used in the same
condition only differ by initial synaptic weights, randomly
generated in order to make each net evolve autonomously.
The same stimuli proposed to human participants were opportunely encoded and input to nets of the corresponding condition.

counts. A more extensive and accurate pre-training could reduce the cognitive overload of feature extraction, by making
categorization and naming tasks more separate. Truly composite actions should be used in the final task, so that combination
and not simple module juxtaposition be required. A fourth
group with a treatment similar to condition (c) but where target
movements be associated with single, not compositional cuemovements could mirror the condition of group (b). As to neural nets, the task would be more realistic (and less straightforward in some cases) if a stimulus categorization were required
(but this would be possible only by adopting more sophisticated visual inputs, like from a simplified retina). The temporal
sequence should also be better controlled, by introducing different forms of learning, also by self-organization.

in retrieving information about movements to be executed
when the same verbal code is used to evoke them? If actions
were defined during learning as a whole by a single, arbitrary
word, would this code be more efficient? Or, if just movements were associated to establish a modal symbolic system,
could it work as an ACSS, that is as a modal system but with
compositional properties?
Our results do not corroborate the hypothesis of an immediate
creation of componential representations during the acquisition
of an artificial language, even if it was componentially structured. The fact that such representations were not available to
our subjects in groups (a) and (c) is revealed by the their poor
performance in the inverse tests. The best results were obtained
only when actions were defined by a single word.
There are at least two possible explanations for this result.
One could be that the hypothesis that actions are represented
componentially is simply to reject. There is, however, another
possibility. This result can probably also be due to the fact that
the productive aspect of language has a categorical basis,
namely it is strictly connected to the discovery of relevant features as an essential premise for any subsequent featural and
not holistic representation, and this may have been a supplementary burden that made the task more difficult than expected, at least in condition (a). We had been confident that the
systematic organisation of our stimuli, whose structure followed the natural language syntax, and that also could be inferred from the button arrangement on the screen during the
Interactive Learning phase, could allow such discovery. Evidently, this did not happen to a full extent, even if some more
salient or distinctive movements, like to wave hands, were
quickly associated with corresponding cues; the true problem
was to detect more subtle or less evident differences, like the
one between hand and forearm movements.
We must also take into account that holistic association
might have been the most economical strategy in the context of
our experiment, where tasks were not goal-directed. We are
aware of the limits (also from an ecological point of view) of
trying to reproduce the early stages of symbol acquisition using meaningless material with adults subjects, because, among
many differences with infants, they may resort to strategies for
connecting meaningless stimuli with meaningful representations (images, associations, etc.). We know from the final interviews that our subjects did it. The use of nets is paradigmatic then to let us see the difference between what a cognitive
system can do “in the vacuum”: paradoxically, nets can
achieve more easily a clearly structured representation by extracting featural regularities without interference from other
associations.
As to the issue of modal nature of action representation, we
believe that symbols help in making distinctions; they are used
when they are needed to accomplish this function. The issue is
not to state definitively whether they are modal or not, analogue or not, but if they are consistently mapped to what they
are assumed to represent.
Future developments. The paradigm we have presented is
only at an early stage of development. Many improvements
may increase its usefulness for more accurate theoretical ac-
