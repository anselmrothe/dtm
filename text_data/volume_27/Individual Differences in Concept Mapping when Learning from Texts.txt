main categories were as follows:
   (1) Elaboration of Concepts. The learner connected his
own knowledge with the learning content by generating
examples or paraphrasing (Weinstein & Mayer, 1986). This
category refers to the elaboration function of concept maps
(e.g., “So, if I took one of my skin cells and put the nucleus
in an ovum, an embryo would grow that is just like me. Its
stem cells would fit me perfectly.”).
   (2) Organization. This category was coded when a state-
ment refers to (a) the importance of a concept, or (b) the
hierarchical classification of a concept (Weinstein & Mayer,
1986) (reduction function; e.g., “Embryonic stem cells are
an important sub-category of stem cells. I’m going to make
