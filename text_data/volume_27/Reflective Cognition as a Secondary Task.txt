experiment, people who have shifted to more logical use are
expected to have increased reaction times, since they now
have to overrule their automated interpretation process.
   In addition to conducting more experiments, cognitive
modeling could also be used to find answers to the remaining
questions. This could be particularly helpful in determining
what kind of reasoning processes, automated or deliberate,
are involved in using scalar terms and theory of mind reason-
ing. Also, it could be investigated what parameters, such as
for example working memory capacity, correlate with the use
of a particular order of ToM reasoning and a particular type
of language use.
