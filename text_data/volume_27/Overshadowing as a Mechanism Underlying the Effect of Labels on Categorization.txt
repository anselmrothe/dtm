   The aim of the current study was to determine if hearing

the perceived similarity of these entities by directing
attention to commonalities or by overshadowing differences
(Experiment 1), whether these effects are specific to count
nouns produced by a person (Experiment 2), and how these
effects change throughout development (Experiment 3).
Given that previous studies showed that auditory input often
overshadows visual stimuli, and that these effects are not
specific to labels (Napolitano & Sloutsky, 2004; Robinson
& Sloutsky, 2004; Sloutsky & Napolitano, 2003), it was
expected that both labels and speech-like sounds would                                           V1
