   2 Extending DOP to Scientific Explanation
What do derivational explanations in physics look like?

be turned into a tree. This tree represents the various

mass M. We will refer to such a tree as a derivation tree.
A derivation tree is a labeled tree in which each node is                                F = 4 π2 mr/P2           F = GMm/r 2
