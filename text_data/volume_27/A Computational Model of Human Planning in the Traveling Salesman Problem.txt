   From a neuroanatomical point of view, the substrates of
planning skills are located in frontal areas: planning deficits
have long been associated with frontal lobe lesions (Cooper
& Shallice, 2000; Duncan, 1986; Goel & Grafman, 1995,
2000; Shallice, 1982, 1988). More specifically, the crucial
role of the frontal lobe in visuo-spatial planning has been
demonstrated using the TSP variant described above.
Patients with frontal lesions and normal subjects under
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the
frontal lobes showed a significant reduction in the number
of heuristic changes which are usually performed during the
execution of the task (fig.1a) (Basso et al., submitted).
