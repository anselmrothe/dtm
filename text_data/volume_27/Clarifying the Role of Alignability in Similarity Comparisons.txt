Similarity is an important construct in cognitive science. It          comes from Markman and Gentner (1996). In one study,

represented as structured descriptions comprising object
attributes, objects, relations among objects, and higher order
relations among relations. As in a feature-based theory of
similarity (Tversky, 1977), structure-mapping assumes that
similarity is a positive function of common properties and a
negative function of distinctive properties.

                          Experiment 2
   So far, Experiment 1 shows that number can serve as an
alignable dimension, and can even win out over common
spatial relational structure in some cases. Now let us step
back and ask when we should expect the numerical dimension
to be more salient than other bases for alignment. Two
