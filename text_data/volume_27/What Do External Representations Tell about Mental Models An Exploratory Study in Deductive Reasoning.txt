effects, whenever present, should not subvert the relative
difficulty of inferences (as confirmed by a control
experiment reported below). We will address a few research
questions that pertain to central assumptions of the TMM. 1)
Does the quantity of models constructed affect deductive
performance? 2) Does the quality of models constructed
affect deductive performance? 3) Which types of models are
easier to generate? Furthermore, our experimental
methodology will allow us to investigate additional aspects
of the process of model editing.
                     Experimental design
Unlike other past work with external model (Zhang and
Norman, 1994; Kirsh and Maglio, 1996; Bauer and
Johnson-Laird, 1993; Bucciarelli and Johnson-Laird, 1999),
the goal of our research is not to check whether external,
explicit models are useful as an heuristic support in
deductive tasks, but to devise a methodology which allows
us to make as explicit as possible the mental models people        Figure 1: An example of visual materials for assembling

Models can be built by assembling objects from such a set.
Intuitively, given a premise like “Stefano has black hair”,          Laura doesn’t have red hair.
