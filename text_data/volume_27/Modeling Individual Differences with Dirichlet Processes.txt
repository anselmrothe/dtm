Abstract
We introduce a Bayesian framework for modeling individual differences, in which subjects are assumed to belong to one of a potentially infinite number of groups. In
this model, the groups observed in any particular data
set are not viewed as a fixed set that fully explain the
variation between individuals, but rather as representatives of a latent, arbitrarily rich structure. As more people are seen, the number of observed groups is allowed
to grow, as more details about the individual differences
are revealed. We use the Dirichlet process – a distribution widely used in nonparametric Bayesian statistics
– to define a prior for the model, allowing us to learn
flexible parameter distributions without overfitting the
data, or requiring the complex computations typically
required for determining the dimensionality of a model.
As an initial demonstration of the approach, we present
an application of the method to categorization data.

Much of cognitive science involves the development
and evaluation of models. Models formalize theoretical predictions and have been successfully applied to
a range of phenomena. A recurrent problem, however,
is that individual differences between people are often
overlooked. This occurs because, most often, models
are evaluated against data that have been averaged or
aggregated across subjects, and so assume that there
are no individual differences between them. In this paper we introduce a new framework for modeling individual differences. Informed by recent insights in statistics
and machine learning (e.g., Escobar & West, 1995; Neal,
2000), our infinite groups model makes it possible to divide subjects who behave similarly into groups, without
assuming an upper bound on the number of groups. This
model is sufficiently flexible to capture the heterogeneous
structure produced by different subjects pursuing different strategies, allows the number of groups to grow naturally as we observe more data, and avoids the complex
computations often required for determining the dimensionality of an individual differences model.

Modeling Individual Differences
In those cases of cognitive modeling that recognize individual differences, it is usually assumed that each subject
behaves in accordance with a different parameterization,
θ, of a single model, and that model is evaluated against
the data from each subject separately (e.g., Ashby, Maddox & Lee, 1994; Nosofsky, 1986). Although this avoids
the problem of corrupting the underlying pattern of the
1594

data, it also foregoes the potential benefits of averaging, and guarantees that models are fit to all of the
noise in the data. Clearly, individual subject analysis
increases the risk of overfitting, and hence reduces the
ability to make accurate predictions or to generalize to
new contexts. As a result, a number of authors have
considered more economical ways of expressing individual differences, which seek to describe the ways in which
people are the same as well as the ways in which they
are different (e.g., Peruggia, Van Zandt & Chen, 2002;
Rouder, Sun, Speckman, Lu & Zhou, in press; Steyvers,
Tenenbaum, Wagenmakers & Blum, 2003; Webb & Lee,
2004).
Two dominant approaches have emerged in the literature on modeling individual differences. In the stochastic parameters model (e.g., Peruggia et al., 2002; Rouder
et al., in press), every participant is assumed to have a
unique parameter value θ that is randomly sampled from
a parametric distribution, as illustrated in Figure 1a. In
contrast, the groups model assumes that people fall into
one of a number of different clusters. Within a group,
people are assumed to behave in essentially the same
way, but each group is qualitatively different. Under
this approach to individual differences modeling (e.g.,
Lee & Webb, in press; Steyvers et al., 2003; Webb &
Lee, 2004), the goal is to partition subjects into a number of groups and associate each group with a parameter
set θ, as illustrated by the parameter distribution shown
in Figure 1b.

Hierarchical Bayesian Models
The assumptions underlying these two approaches to
modeling individual differences can be understood by
viewing both as hierarchical Bayesian models (e.g., Lindley & Smith, 1972). If data arise from a parametric distribution x ∼ F (· | θ) described by some cognitive model,
then there is assumed to exist a higher-order process
G(· | φ) that generates the values of θ. A two level hierarchical model with parameters φ is written,
θ|φ ∼
x|θ ∼

G(· | φ)
F (· | θ).

To apply Bayesian inference to such a model, we also
need to define a prior on φ. We will assume that φ ∼ π(·)
for an appropriate distribution π(·).
In the stochastic parameters model G(· | φ) is usually
a tractable distribution such as a Gaussian, with φ corre-

assumed by the stochastic parameters model, but still
allows efficient inference. We assume that subjects are
drawn from an infinite number of groups, taking G(· | φ)
to be a weighted combination of an infinite number of
point masses, as in Figure 1c. That is,
G(· | w, ξ) =

sponding to the parameters of that distribution. In the
groups model G(· | φ) is a weighted collection of k point

where δ(ξj ) denotes a point mass located at θ = ξj and
P
where kj=1 wj = 1. In the groups model, φ corresponds
to the parameters (w, ξ).
This perspective reveals some of the strengths and
weaknesses of these two models. Assuming that θ follows a parametric distribution, as in the stochastic parameters model, simplifies the problem of fitting individual differences models to data, but places strong constraints on the kind of variation that can manifest across
subjects. A particularly severe problem arises when we
specify a unimodal distribution to capture individual differences that are inherently multimodal. In this case the
model cannot capture the most important aspect of the
variation between people.
Unlike the stochastic parameters approach, the parameter distributions postulated by group models naturally account for multimodality in individual differences.
By postulating two groups, for instance, we arrive at a
bimodal distribution. However, there is a lack of flexibility in parameter distributions consisting only of a few
point masses. Moreover, a computational problem faced
by the groups model is the difficulty in choosing the number of groups. This is typically treated as a model selection problem, addressed by evaluating a series of models
which assume different numbers of groups. Such a strategy is time-consuming, and makes the false assumption
that there really is a fixed number of groups, with future subjects belonging to the same set of groups. In
the remainder of the paper we will explore a model that
combines the strengths of these two approaches, having
the flexibility of the groups model, but a simple inference
algorithm.

The Infinite Groups Model
In the infinite groups model, we adopt a distribution on
θ that is more flexible than the parametric distribution
1595

While we assume that the number of groups is unbounded, any finite set of subjects will contain representatives from a finite subset of these groups. By avoiding
setting an upper bound on the number of groups, we no
longer need to perform explicit model selection to identify the number of groups. This model has an inherent
psychological plausibility: people can vary in any number of ways, only some of which will be observed in a finite sample. With infinitely many groups, there is always
the possibility that a new subject can display a pattern of
behavior that has never been seen before. Moreover, the
approach requires us to make our assumptions explicit,
in the form of a well-defined prior distribution over the
number of observed groups. In contrast, in most finiteorder model selection scenarios these assumptions are
usually swept up in an implicit and often inappropriate
uniform prior over model order (for a notable exception,
see Courville, Daw, Gordon & Touretzky, 2004).
In order to apply Bayesian inference in the hierarchical
model defined by Equation 2, we need to define a prior
π(·) on the parameters of G, in this case w and ξ. In a
finite groups model with k groups (i.e., Equation 1), a
standard prior is
ξ
∼
G0(·)
w | α, k ∼ Dirichlet(α/k, . . ., α/k).

(3)

In this prior, the locations of the k point masses ξj are
sampled from the base distribution denoted G0(·). The
Dirichlet distribution over w gives us a prior over the
different ways in which k groups could be weighted, in
Qk
(α/k)−1
which p(w | α, k) ∝ j=1 wj
. Specifying the base
distribution, G0 and the dispersion parameter of the
Dirichlet distribution, α, defines a prior over distributions G(·) for any finite groups model.
If we take the limit of the prior π(·) defined by Equation 3 as k → ∞, we obtain the distribution known as
the Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973). This distribution
takes its name from the fact that is very much like an infinite dimensional Dirichlet distribution (see Schervish,
1995, pp. 52-60; Ghosh & Ramamoorthi, 2003). The
Dirichlet process provides a prior for infinite models,
and inference in models using this prior is generally
straightforward. If the distribution G(·) is sampled from
a Dirichlet process, we write G | G0, α ∼ DP (· | G0, α),
so the infinite groups model can be written
G | G0, α ∼
θ|G ∼
x|θ ∼

DP (· | G0, α)
G(·)
F (· | θ),

where α is the dispersion parameter (setting the prior
on w) and G0(·) is the base distribution on ξ. In this

p(gi = j | g−i, α, k) = (nj + α/k)/(i − 1 + α),
where nj denotes the number of elements in g−i that are
equal to j. If we let k → ∞, the limiting probabilities
are
 nj
if j ≤ k−i
i−1+α
p(gi = j | g−i, α) ∝
α
otherwise,
i−1+α
where k−i denotes the number of distinct groups present
in g−i. This gives the appropriate conditional probability under the Dirichlet process (Neal, 2000).
Through the distribution over group assignments, the
Dirichlet process induces a prior p(k | α, n) over the number of unique groups k that will manifest among n subjects. Antoniak (1974) shows that p(k | α, n) ∝ znk αk ,
where znk is an unsigned Stirling number of the first
kind (see Abramowitz & Stegun, 1972). He also observes
that the expected number of components sampled from
a Dirichlet process is approximately given by,


n+α
E[k | α, n] ≈ α ln
.
α
Thus, although k → ∞ with probability 1 as n → ∞,
the number of components increases approximately logarithmically with the number of observations.
In most contexts the dispersion α is unknown, so we
specify a prior distribution p(α), allowing us to learn α
from data. The posterior distribution over α is given by
p(α | k, n) ∝ B(α, n)αkp(α),
where B(α, n) is a standard Beta function. A common choice for p(α) is the Gamma distribution α | a, b ∼
Gamma(· | a, b) in which p(α) ∝ αa−1e−bα (Escobar &
West, 1995). If so,
p(α | k, n) ∝ αa+k−1e−bαB(α, n).

model, the base distribution G0(·) represents our prior
beliefs about the kinds of parameter values θ that are
likely to capture human performance in a particular task,
while the dispersion parameter α represents the amount
of variation that we expect to see in a finite sample. If
α is low, then most people will be expected to behave
similarly to one another, and the distribution G(·) will
concentrate most of its mass on a few points. However,
if α is large, then people will be expected to be very
different to one another, and G(·) will spread its mass
over a large number of points.
The Dirichlet process defines a distribution over the
assignment of subjects to groups. Since wj gives the
probability that the ith observation belongs to the jth
group, it is convenient to introduce the group membership variable gi , such that p(gi = j) = wj . Given the
group assignments of i − 1 subjects, it is straightforward to compute the probability distribution over gi
given g−i = {g1, . . . , gi−1}. In a finite groups model
with the prior given in Equation 3, we can integrate over
w1, . . . , wk , and obtain

the top row k = 8 and n = 10, while in the bottom row
k = 79 and n = 1000. In both cases, the expected value of α
is approximately 20. On the left hand side, the Gamma priors
over α have the same scale parameter but vary in shape. On
the right hand side,the priors have the same shape parameter
but vary in scale.

In particular, Escobar and West (1995) note that if we
let a → 0 and b → 0 we obtain a so-called scale-invariant
prior in which p(α) ∝ 1/α (see Jeffreys, 1961). Posterior
distributions for α are shown in Figure 2. The influence
of the prior is shown by varying both the shape (left
hand side) and the scale (right hand side) parameters.

Modeling Discrete Data
We now turn to the derivation and application of the
infinite groups model to situations in which participants
provide discrete data. Suppose that n people perform
some task in which m possible responses can be made
on each trial, and each person experiences s trials. We
can describe the ith participant’s responses with the vector xi = (xi1, . . . , xim), where xih counts the number
of times that they made the hth response. Using the
Dirichlet process, we assume that each person belongs
to one of an infinite number of groups, and that the parameters for the jth group describe a multinomial rate
θj = (θj1, . . . , θjm ) such that θjh denotes the probability
with which a member of group j makes response h on
any given trial. Since this likelihood function is multinomial, it is convenient to assume that the base distribution
G0(·) is a Dirichlet distribution with symmetric parameter β. We will assume that the dispersion parameter
α is unknown, and follows a Gamma distribution with
parameters a and b. The model is illustrated in Figure 3.
This model lends itself to inference by Gibbs sampling,
a Monte Carlo method for sampling from the posterior
distribution over the variables in a Bayesian model (see
Neal, 2000; Gilks, Richardson & Spiegelhalter, 1995). In

Since this conditional distribution is difficult to directly
sample from, it is convenient to employ a “data augmentation”, in which we view p(α | g, x) as the marginalization over η of the joint distribution,
p(α, η | k, n) ∝ αa+k−1e−bα ηα−1(1 − η)n−1.
Using this joint distribution, we can find p(α | η, k, n) and

Gibbs sampling, we fix all assignments except one and
sample that assignment from the conditional posterior
p(gi | g−i, x), a procedure which eventually converges to
samples from the complete posterior p(g | x). Since the
Dirichlet is conjugate to the multinomial, it is straightforward to show that the conditional posterior distribution over the ith group assignment is given by Equation
5. In this expression, q−i,j,h denotes the number of times
that a participant (not including the ith) currently assigned to group j made response h, and q−i,j denotes
the total number of responses made by these participants. The terms q·,j,h and q·,j are defined similarly,
except that the ith participant’s data are not excluded.
For the dispersion parameter, we treat the prior over
α as a Gamma(· | a, b) distribution. Using Antoniak’s
(1974) results, the conditional posterior over α depends
only on the number of observed groups k, not the specific assignments. Thus, by expanding the Beta function
B(α, n) in Equation 4 we observe that

Equations 5 and 6 define the Gibbs sampler.
As a simple illustration, we created random data sets
with n people and s discrete observations per person,
where each observation denotes a choice of one of m response options. The sample was divided into k groups,
and each group associated with a multinomial rate θ
sampled from a uniform distribution. People were allocated randomly to groups using a uniform distribution, subject to the constraint that each group contained
at least one member. Note that this allocation scheme
means that the Dirichlet process model is misspecified
(which is as it should be in any worthwhile simulation).
Results are shown in Figure 4. The posterior distributions over α are shown on the left and the posterior distributions over k are shown on the right. On the whole,
the distributions converge on sensible answers, though in
both cases they reflect a fair degree of uncertainty about
the number of groups present in the sample.

Individual Differences in Categorization
We now present an application of the infinite groups
model. An elegant category learning experiment by
McKinley and Nosofsky (1995) investigated 10 people’s1
ability to discriminate between the two probabilistic categories shown in Figure 5. The stimuli were circles with a
radial line running through them, and so the two dimensions depicted in Figure 5 correspond to the radius of the
circle, and the angle of the line. Category A (dark grey)
is a mixture of four Gaussian distributions, while category B is a mixture of two Gaussians. On any given trial
in the experiment, a stimulus was sampled from one of
the six Gaussian distributions. Participants were asked
whether it came from category A or category B, and
provided feedback as to the accuracy of their response.
Because the categories are inherently probabilistic and
the category densities are quite complicated, this task is
very difficult, and shows evidence of differences not only
during the course of category learning, but in the final
structures learned.
In order to learn about the variation between participants, we applied the infinite groups model to the data
1
McKinley and Nosofsky (1995) actually report data for
11 participants. However, the data currently available to us
include only 10 of these.

from this experiment. Since each trial is labeled by the
Gaussian distribution (i.e., A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, or B2)
from which it was sampled, a natural way of viewing each
participant’s data is in terms of the probability of making the correct response to stimuli sampled from each of
the six components. For each of the 10 participants we
used only the last 300 trials of the experiment, in order
to look for differences in the learned category structure,
rather than differences in the learning process itself. In
order to conduct a Bayesian analysis, we set principled
a priori parameter values rather than fitting the model
to the data. Since we know that both responses (i.e.,
“A” and “B”) are possible but are otherwise “ignorant”,
the natural choice for the base distribution is the uniform distribution β = 1 (see Jaynes, 2003, pp. 382–386),
and since we have no strong beliefs about α we set the
scale-invariant prior (see Jeffreys, 1961) in which a → 0,
b → 0.
To illustrate the manner in which the model grows
with the data, imagine that the 10 participants entered
the lab in order of participant ID. Figure 6 shows how
the posterior distribution over k changes as more participants are observed. Initially there is evidence for only a
single group, but once the 10th participant is observed,
there is strong evidence for about 3 or 4 groups, as illustrated in Figure 7. A more detailed description of
the relationships between participants is presented in Table 1, which shows the (marginal) probability that any
two participants belong to the same group, and reveals
a rich pattern of similarities and differences. A subset
of this interaction is illustrated in Figure 8, which plots
the last 300 stimuli observed by participants 5, 7, 8 and

participant 5 is sensitive only to variation along the xaxis, participant 7 is sensitive only to variation on the
y-axis, while participants 8 and 9 do a good job of learning the category structures on both dimensions. As a
result, participants 5 and 7 rarely appear in the same
group as one another or with participants 8 or 9 (with
probabilities ranging from 0% to 7%), while participants
8 and 9 almost always (91%) co-occur.

General Discussion
The individual differences framework outlined in this paper provides a natural method of representing the similarities and differences between people. Moreover the
groups that are seen in any particular sample are not
viewed as a fixed structure that fully explains the variation between individuals, but rather as representatives
of a latent, arbitrarily rich structure. This means that,
had we subsequently observed another 100 participants
in the McKinley and Nososky (1995) experiment, the
number and variety of observed groups would grow as
more detail about individual differences are revealed.
The approach can be extended in a number of ways.
Firstly, in many situations we may want continuous multimodal parameter distributions. An “infinite stochastic groups” model would convolve each of the point
masses in the Dirichlet process with a continous distribution, giving an infinite model that subsumes both the
groups model and the stochastic parameters model. A
second direction in which the framework could be extended would be to allow structured relationships between groups. Finally, we may wish to consider an “idiosyncratic strategies model”, in which it is assumed that
all participants draw on a common set of strategies but
combine them in an unique way.
