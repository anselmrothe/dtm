     Part 1: Learning to make coffee on screen
The main purpose of the first part of the experiment was to
familiarize participants with the virtual coffee task.
Participants had to discover the order of steps required to
make tea or coffee, subject to constraints imposed by the
environment, the instructions and their previous knowledge.
For the sake of comparability, the virtual coffee task was
held as closely as possible to the task employed in both of
the above simulations (see Botvinick & Plaut, 2004). Task
sequences were constructed by concatenating a choice out
of six invariant sub sequences:
      adding coffee grounds (7 steps); adding teabag (6 steps);
      adding milk (7 steps); adding sugar from pack (7 steps);            Figure 1: A typical stage set-up.

led to positive feedback in the form of the mouth going
“Mmhhh!” after drinking the beverage.
Secondary task: The aim of the secondary task was to divert
attention from the production task without interfering in
other ways. Therefore, the secondary task was purely
auditory, required a response only after completion of the
production task and was set up to be as unpredictable as
possible to avoid routinization of the secondary task or
success by guessing.
     While preparing the beverage, subjects would hear
different quotes out of several Monty Python movies. They
were required to count how often the utterance of the word
“Ni” occurred. The “Ni”-sound (lasting 0.5 sec) was chosen
with a probability of 50%. Due to the large differences in          Figure 2: Overall task performance in terms of
