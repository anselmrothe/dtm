   We made three predictions about the MDL approach.
First, we hypothesized that early in development, i.e., for a
small language corpus, larger units will be more efficient for
encoding the language than smaller units. This is because
the length of encoding the list of units will be small for both
utterance-level encoding as well as a phoneme-level
encoding as the diversity of utterances will not be very
great. However, the cost of encoding the language will be
smaller for the utterance-level as the number of units in the
corpus will be much smaller. Later in development, i.e., for                                                   Corpus Size (Utterances)
