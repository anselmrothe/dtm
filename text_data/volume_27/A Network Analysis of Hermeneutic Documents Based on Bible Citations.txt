   Moreover, the network structure is also useful for
extracting and numerically analyzing semantic differences

   This paper demonstrates that our new method is effective
by comparing abstract thoughts and extracting common and
unique elements in those abstract thoughts objectively. Our
network representation and analysis provides a scientific
basis for research in more abstract fields, such as theology.
