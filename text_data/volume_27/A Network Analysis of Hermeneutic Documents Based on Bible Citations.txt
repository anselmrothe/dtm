important when handling extremely large text corpus. By
utilizing these new scientific methods, we can (a) ensure the
objectivity and replication of results, (b) handle large-scale
data in a uniform manner, and (c) reduce information
processing costs.
We believe that it is possible to analyze the abstract
thoughts and value systems embodied within a text corpus
with such methods. In this paper, we analyze a Christian
text corpus. Traditional religions have exerted great
influences on humanity throughout history. Most religions
have at their core some canonical texts, with the
hermeneutics, or interpretations, of the canon is also usually
in text format. Thus, it is possible to represent key
conceptualizations with the canonical texts through their
objective analysis.

Abstract
In order to handle systematic thought, we propose a new
method of representing the main elements of a
conceptualization in the form of a network based on the
relations between the citations for frequently-used
propositions within a text corpus. This method makes it
possible to automatically extract the central components of a
systematic thought and to analyze the relationships between
these by using the clustering method. In the present study, we
have constructed three networks of Christian dogma based on
the writings of St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas and Pope
John Paul II, and have analyzed the clusters to objectively
extract common elements and individual characteristics. Our
network representation and analysis method help to lay the
foundations for scientific research in abstract fields of human
thought, such as theology. Reflecting the ways in which
certain individuals perceived a particular canonical text, such
as the Bible, these characterizations of key conceptualizations
provide important insights into the structure of the canonical
text itself. And. this method can be applied to other field
where there are frequent repetitions of propositions or
sentences in order to objectively analyze their meanings or
interpretations.

Goals

Background and Goals
Background
As an aspect of higher cognitive functions, systematic
thought has primarily been investigated using literaturebased approaches, with texts that are usually more abstract
and subjective in nature than scientific papers. However, as
systematic ideas and thought influence all areas of human
activity and thinking, the application of NLP (Natural
Language Processing) techniques may provide a more
objective understanding of systematic thought. Recently,
new methods are being developed, such as the extraction of
metric characteristics for text corpora (Liu, 1993; White &
Mccain, 1989) specially using co-citation analysis methods
(Finn, 2004; Meyer, 2004), text summarization through the
automatic classification of citation information (Nanba &
Okumura, 2000). Within the field of cognitive structure as
well, new approaches are being developed with which to
symbolize and represent concepts in the form of networks
such as a Conceptual Map (Rye, 2002; Nelson & McKinney
1993). Methods that are capable of automatically extracting
the main elements of a conceptualization are particularly
1565

Specifically, the goals of this study are to automatically
extract the main elements of a number of key
conceptualizations from a large-scale religious text corpus
and analyze the cluster construction of them using an
objective and replicable methodology. This, in turn, will
provide an objective basis for the examination of systematic
thought.
Here we focus on the writings of St. Augustine and St.
Thomas Aquinas, two influential Church Fathers, as well as
those of Pope John Paul II to extract essential teachings of
the Catholic dogma through historical transition and to
identify individual characteristics of hermeneutics. Based on
the patterns of the Bible citations within their writings, we
created networks for frequently cited sections of the Bible,
and extracted the main elements and clusters of these, in
order to compare a number of key conceptualizations.

The Canon and its hermeneutic literature
The pillars of the Catholic value system are the Sacred
Scripture (the Bible), the Sacred Tradition, and the Teaching
Office (Paul VI, 1965; John Paul II, 1992). Of these, Bible
study is the soul of sacred theology. On the other hand, the
Sacred Tradition and the Teaching Office have important
roles in interpreting the Bible.
Thus, Catholic dogma consists of the Bible and its
interpretative literature. By the complete and systematic
analysis of the interpretations of each section of the Bible
and of the relationships between these, it is possible to

visualize the Catholic value system. The text data consists
of writings by Pope John Paul II, posted on the Vatican Web
Site (English version of Encyclicals, Motu proprio, Apostlic
Exohtation, Homily, Apostlic Letter, and Speech etc. 3125
files), the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas (29 titles,
including “Summa Theologica” and “Summa Contra
Gentiles”) and the writings of St. Augustine (29 titles,
including “The city of God” and “Confessions”, and 221
homilies).

which vi exceeded the citation threshold ( Th1 ). The each
couple of the V ′ sections were connected if the co-citation
value ( eij ) exceeded a co-citation threshold ( Th2 ).

Methods

2: Connections were also made to sections that intervened
between V ′ sections and also had co-citation values over
the co-citation threshold ( Th2 ).

First, the patterns of the Bible citations were compared
for the complete corpus. Then, the relationships between the
cited sections of the Bible are extracted by co-citation
analysis, from which the citation networks were created.
After that, the clusters of those networks are identified, and
characteristics of these networks are compared.

Characteristics of the Bible citations
Comparisons of the three authors looked at citation
distributions, and at which sections and books of the Bible
were citations most frequently taken from.

Construction of the citation networks based on cocitation analysis

Networks are usually composed of some clusters. We can
understand the characteristics of networks by extracting the
clusters and analyzing these mutual relationships.
There are many clustering algorisms. In this paper we
extract clusters by shifting the co-citation threshold ( Th2 ).
The first merit is that the clusters reflect the strength of cocitations. Normal methods that extract some type of cliques
reflect only the network topology. The second merit is that
we can change the size of the clusters by shifting the cocitation threshold, making it easier to extract clusters of
appropriate sizes.

The Bible is separated into units of book, chapter and
section, and numbers are assigned to these units. In this
study, a citation unit is defined as the smallest section.
Although there is some variation in the lengths of these
sections, frequent-cited sections are generally about 1 to 2
sentences. Co-citation analysis was used to analyze these
cited sections.
As Small claims, given that co-cited texts have certain
similarities, the degree of similarity between texts will
increase in proportion to the number of co-citations (White
& McCain, 1989).
Within the Catholic hermeneutic literature, there are many
Bible citations, making it possible to measure the similarity
between two Bible sections in terms of the frequency of
their co-citation. By connecting sections that have high
frequencies of co-citation to form a citation network, it is
possible to represent the complete doctrine. Although the
citing unit normally used in co-citation analysis is the whole
document, because these texts are divided into smaller
semantic units according to Catholic tradition, this unit was
used as the present analysis.
In line with one of the goals of this study—to capture the
main elements of a conceptualization— we have focused on
the central parts of the networks, where the elements are
both frequently cited sections and for which co-citation
frequency is above a certain threshold (Murai & Tokosumi,
2004).

Results
Citation and Co-citation Patterns
Table 1 presents all citations, all cited sections, all cocitations, and all co-cited section pairs, together with all
sections that include the Bible citations and the average
citations per unit for the three authors. While the writings of
St. Thomas include more various citations, those of John
Paul II have little diversity in terms of the total citations.

Table 2 shows the most frequently cited books of the
Bible. The numbers of each book are the ratios of the

Of these, 14 books are common to three authors (Bold).
This result indicates a similarity in their patterns of citation.
The Gospel according to John is the most cited Gospel. And,
John Paul II cites more sections from the Gospels than the
others. However, analysis of the most frequently cited
sections, (Table 3), shows that common sections are rather
rare. There are only 5 common sections (Bold: Jn1:14,
Jn14:6, Ph2:7, Ph2:8, Rm5:5) among the top 40.

Discussions
Individual Characteristics
St. Augustine’s network consists of two relatively
separate parts; one including Matthew 6:12-13 and Rome
7:18-25 and one covering John 1:1-14 and Philippians 2:68. Although his two main themes are incarnation and the
struggle with sin, they are only weakly related.
There are stronger connections between the clusters
within St. Thomas’s network, where the central concepts are
concerned with incarnation (John 1:14, Philippians 2:7-8,
Ephesians 5:2), the Trinity (Rome 5:5, 8:15, 29, Galatians
4:4), and love and faith (Ephesians 3:17, 1 John 4:16).
The network for Pope John Paul II has a large cluster
concerned with spreading the Gospel (Matthew 28:19-20,
John 17:21, 20:20-21, Acts 1:8). This may reflect the
presence within the corpus of highly authoritative texts that
are probably more representative of Vatican opinion.

Common Characteristics
Common elements in the teachings of the Catholic
Church are a constant emphasis on Jn1:14, Jn14:6, Ph2:7,
Ph2:8, Rm5:5. According to the clustering results, Jn14:6,
Ph2:7 and Ph2:8 compose common clusters in three author’s
networks. These sections are about Incarnation.
Jn14:6 is “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one
comes to the Father except through me.” And Rm5:5 is
“hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has
been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that
has been given to us.” These sections are included in
different clusters on each network. Pope John Paul II
includes both within a cluster about Incarnation, but St.
Augustine includes Rm5:5 within a cluster that focuses on
sin. So, we may regard these two interpretations as being
different.
From the citation analysis and citation networks, we may
conclude that the most important teaching of the Catholic
Church common throughout its history is the Incarnation of
Christ.

Conclusions
By representing the frequently-used elements of the
network structure, it is possible to objectively perceive the
complete systematic framework of this complex theology.
This is functionally similar to automatic summarization for
meaning.
Moreover, the network structure is also useful for
extracting and numerically analyzing semantic differences
in fields where complex interpretations are required.
This paper demonstrates that our new method is effective
by comparing abstract thoughts and extracting common and
unique elements in those abstract thoughts objectively. Our
network representation and analysis provides a scientific
basis for research in more abstract fields, such as theology.

To the extent that the extracted structures are reflecting
the semantic structures perceived by the interpreter, it also
provides a means of capturing the inner structure of the
Bible. Accordingly, this network construction and clustering
method can be applied to other field where there are
frequent repetitions of propositions or sentences.
