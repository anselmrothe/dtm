upright faces are identified based on configural aspects
(Leder, & Bruce, 2000). Furthermore, studies with Event-
Related Potentials (ERPs) find that inverted faces have an
increased and delayed N170 component (Rossion et al.,
1999). In accounting for immediate word repetition ERP
results, Huber, Curran, O’Reilly, and Woroch (submitted)
assumed that layer 3 of the network is the neural generator
responsible for N170 effects. Therefore, in extending the
model of Huber and O’Reilly (2003) to the case of face
perception, it follows that layer 3 corresponds to configural
processing, and that changes in the behavioral dynamics with
face inversion are due to changes to this layer of processing.

with upright faces was there a crossover pattern.
     Considering that the low threshold group required shorter
target durations for threshold performance, and considering
the lack of inversion effects for the high threshold group, this
suggests that low threshold participants processed upright
faces in a configural manner, whereas the high threshold
participants processed faces on the basis of individual
features, even when those faces appeared in their proper
upright orientation. In general, identifying faces on the basis
of individual features (e.g., hair styles, nose size, etc.), is not
viewed as particularly effective, although such a strategy may
have been tempting in this experiment considering the
heterogeneity in the features used to comprise these particular
faces. Of course these claims are generalities, and it is                            Figure 3: Neural network organization.
