             The COGENT Environment
COGENT (Cooper & Fox, 1998; Cooper 2002) is a
graphical environment that is designed to simplify the
process of developing and evaluating computational models
of high-level cognitive processes. COGENT does not
embody any particular theory of the cognitive architecture,
nor is it a general purpose programming language. Rather it
provides a set of primitives that may be assembled and
configured to yield a variety of models in many different
domains. COGENT has been used extensively for teaching
cognitive modelling at numerous institutions in Europe and
the US. It also has applications in modelling research.
   The basic system provides the modeller with a sketch pad
on which a model may be drawn as a box and arrow
diagram (see Figure 1). This level of description provides
the psychologist with a familiar notation, thus simplifying
the modelling processes, but is inadequate for a                        Figure 1: A COGENT box and arrow diagram of
