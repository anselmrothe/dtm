                  Concluding Remarks
The present paper preserves a role for an inner core of the
extended mind. Two most outstanding ways in which the
extended mind unfolds are the human handling of tools and
the complex-and-tight coupling between an organism and
her immediate environment. It is a core that manages the
ways in which the in-supporting content works. It works by
organizing various (internal) mental resources to exploit
external resources in the light of supporting what is needed
in the agent’   s problem-solving (including body control)
performance. That role is salient in the human abilities of
maintaining flexible performance. Because it forms the in-
supporting content, that inner core of the extended mind is
privileged compared to the external resources of the
extended mind. The import of the extended mind’      s internal
side is consequently legitimized in embodiment but in a
rather discursive sense, in which the autonomy of
constituting cognition does not rest on the internal mind per
se but yields to the ways in which it supports its
performance.
