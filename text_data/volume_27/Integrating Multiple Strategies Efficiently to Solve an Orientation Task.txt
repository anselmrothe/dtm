                           Introduction
Research on human performance in spatial orientation tasks
has focused on the impact of misalignment on solution
processes (e.g., Hintzman, O’Dell, & Arndt, 1981; Rieser,
1989; Shepard & Hurwitz, 1984). Other research has
examined strategy differences in this area, showing that                    Figure 1: Sample trial. Participants click on the object on the
