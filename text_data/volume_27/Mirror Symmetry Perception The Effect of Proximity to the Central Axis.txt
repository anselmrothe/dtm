                          Introduction
The visual system is extremely efficient at detecting
environmental regularity and it has been argued that
regularities play a crucial role in our understanding of the
visual world (Barlow, 2001). The perception of bilateral (or
mirror) symmetry is one example of this regularity
detection. Specifically, the visual system can be considered
as performing a kind of spatial correspondence calculation
whereby it employs the inherent statistical information
about the positions of pattern elements to establish which of
the elements belong or are grouped together.
   Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that observers
either fail to make use of, or disregard, a high proportion of
the information that is available to them when making
psychophysical judgements of symmetry. For example, a
number of studies have demonstrated that observers are only
able to detect symmetry (or deviations from symmetry) if it
is located within a spatially limited region directly adjacent
to the axis of symmetry (Barlow & Reeves, 1979; Rainville
& Kingdom, 2002). This area has been labelled the
Integration Region and it is hypothesised that the visual
system is unable to make the correspondence calculations
necessary for symmetry detection if signal information is                   Figure 1: Examples of experimental stimuli and the signal

There were five observers (two male, three female), with a
mean age of 25.4 years. All were studying at tertiary level.
The subjects all had either normal or corrected to normal
vision. All observers were naïve with respect to the
