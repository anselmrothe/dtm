First, a brief review of synaptic depression and cell
differentiation is provided. Then the DD model is
presented along with the predictions. Finally, the model
is tested in a list learning experiment with of high and
low frequency words where ERPs are measured during
study.

Abstract
The subsequent memory effect (SME) is the ubiquitous
phenomena that stimulus that are later retrieved show a
more negative going ERP wave than stimulus that are not
retrieved. Two basic findings in neurophysiology are that
cells respond weaker to repeated stimulation (e.g. synaptic
depression) and that the response differentiates during
familiarization. This paper presents a computational
theory of SME based on synaptic depression and cell
differentiation. SME occurs because synaptic depression
is stronger for stimuli with larger cell differentiation and
these stimuli are also easier to retrieve. The model also
predicts a negative subsequent memory effect (NSME) so
that a stimulus that are not preceded with other stimuli are
recovered from synaptic depression, better recalled, and
have a more positive ERP. The model is tested on ERP
data collected during study of short lists followed by free
recall.

Synaptic Depression and Cell Differentiation
Synaptic depression is the strongest form of short-term
plasticity (Nelson, Varela, Sen and Abbott, 1997). The
underlying mechanism of synaptic depression is not fully
understood. However, one mechanism is believed to be
presynaptic depletion of transmitter substances, which is
stored in the release-ready pool of vesicles. With this
depletion, pre-synaptic action potentials have reduced
efficiency on the post-synaptic activity. Synaptic
depression depends on activity so that higher levels of
recent pre-synaptic activity tend to the decrease the
efficiency of transmission.
Synaptic depression can be simulated by a simple
depletion model. This model assumes that a portion of
the available resources needed for transmitting a signal
are consumed with each neural spike (Tsodyks and
Markram, 1997).
Cell differentiation is the empirical phenomena that the
neural representation becomes increasingly distinct, and
that the overall activity decreases, as a stimulus material
is familiarized (Miller and Desimone, 1994; Desimone,
1996). This phenomenon has been studied using single
cells recordings in the temporal and frontal lobes of
monkeys performing the delayed match to sample task.
In this paradigm the monkey is first presented to a
matching stimulus, followed by a sequence of sample
stimuli. The monkey is rewarded for pressing a lever
when the sample stimulus matches the matched stimulus.
For example, Rainer and Miller (2000) used either novel
or familiarized pictures and found that approximately
56% of the cells showed increased activity compared to
baseline for novel stimulus whereas the corresponding
percentage for familiarized stimulus were 24%. Cells
with decreased activity following familiarization are here
called suppressed cells; whereas cells with maintained or
increased activity are called static cells.

Introduction
Subsequently remembered stimuli evoke more positive
going ERPs during study than stimuli that are not
remembered (Sanquist, Rohrbaugh, Syndulko and
Lindley, 1980; Johnson, 1995; Rugg, 1995). This effect
is called the difference due to memory (DM) effect or
the subsequent memory effect (SME, Paller, Kutas and
Mayes, 1987). SME has been found with different
stimulus material and with different test procedures (e.g.,
Sanquist et al., 1980; Besson and Kutas, 1993; Fabiani
and Donchin, 1995). Topographically, two classes of
SME have been found, one with centroparietal and one
with frontal maxima. Frontal subsequent memory effect
are associated with elaborative encoding strategies,
particular right frontal effects may be related to
associative processes (Karis, Fabiani and Donchin, 1984;
Fabiani, Karis and Donchin, 1990), whereas
centroparietal subsequent memory effects are associated
with rote encoding (Fabiani et al., 1995).
This paper proposes a neurophysiologically based
model to account for the subsequent memory effect. This
model is based on the empirical finding of synaptic
depression and cell differentiation and it is therefore
called the differential depression (DD) model. It also
predicts that for certain experimental conditions a more
negative ERP may also be associated with successful
subsequent memory.

The primacy effect
The primacy effect is the empirical phenomena that the
first few items in a list are better recalled than items in
the middle of the list (Murdock, 1960). The primacy
effect is often accounted for by rehearsal in short-term
2021

memory, where full attention can be maintained to the
first presented item, whereas items later in the list
compete for attention with earlier presented items
present in the short-term buffer. A problem with the
rehearsal account is that a primacy effect typically is
obtained when rehearsal is eliminated (see for example,
Wixted and McDowell, 1989). The primacy effect
typically lasts for fewer serial positions when rehearsal is
eliminated, however, the magnitude measured as the
relative decrease from the first position typically is as
large as under conditions when rehearsal is allowed.
Here it is argued that synaptic depression may play a role
in the primacy effect.

The Differential-Depression Model
The Differential-Depression (DD) model is based on
synaptic depression and cell differentiation. The aim of
the model is to account for the stimuli evoked change in
neural activity depending on various psychological
variables and at the same time account for the memory
performance at the behavioral level. The model
represents neural activity using rate coding in single
neural cells.
The postsynaptic activity of a cell is simply the
presynaptic activity, times the conductance between the
pre and postsynaptic cells, times the amount of resources
available for transmitting the presynaptic signal to the
postsynaptic cell. The presynaptic activity is assumed to
rise slowly at an exponential rate following stimulus
onset.
The available resources are assumed to be consumed
proportionally to the post-synaptic activity, and to
recover spontaneously at an exponential rate in absence
of post-synaptic activity. Resources are assumed to be
fully available prior to the onset of the first stimulus, and
reaches to an asymptotic value over the first few items in
a list of stimuli.

(static+suppressed cells)

NSME

The conductance between the pre and post-synaptic
cells is assumed to be undifferentiated for novel
stimulus, so that suppressed and static cells have the
same conductance. Following familiarization static cells
increases their conductance, whereas suppressed cells
decrease their conductance. The change in conductance
is assumed to be modulated by long-term potentiation
(LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic
efficiency (for reviews see, Lynch, 2003)
Because the synaptic depression depends on the postsynaptic activity, the DD model assumes a pre-synaptic
expression of LTP and LTD. Evidence for presynaptic
involvement of synaptic depression includes, LTP
activates PKA presynaptically (Tong, Malenka and
Nicoll, 1996), Genistein inhibits LTP by acting
presynaptically (Casey, Maguire, Kelly, Gooney and
Lynch, 2002), LTP enhances Externally Regulated
Kinases (ERK) activation presynaptically (Casey et al.,
2002), LTP activates cAMP response element binding
protein (CREB) presynaptically (Gooney and Lynch,
2001). Although, evidence for post-synaptic expression
of LTD / LTP is also available (for a review see Lynch,
2003).

Basic mechanisms in the DD-model
The increase in synaptic plasticity for static cells
following familiarization is assumed to be balanced by
the decrease in conductance for suppressed cells, so that
the expected sum of the conductance for all cells is
constant over time. However, familiarization decreases
the post-synaptic activity for suppressed cells more than
it increases the post-synaptic activity for static cells, so
that the summed activity for suppressed and static cells
decreases with familiarization (see Figure 1). This occurs
because static cells are more influenced by synaptic
depression (because they are more active) than
suppressed cells (that are less active). This phenomenon
is henceforth coined differential depression, because the

potential, and are more likely to be recalled than stimuli
with low cell differentiation. That is a subsequent
memory effect (SME) is predicted.
Furthermore, synaptic depression is assumed to be low
in empirical conditions where stimuli are not preceded
with other stimuli. That is the first stimuli in a list will
have a lower synaptic depression, a higher neural
activity, a more negative N400 potential, and a better
free recall performance compared to stimulus in the
middle of the list. This prediction is called a negative
subsequent memory effect (NSME) because good
performance is associated to conditions with negative,
rather than positive ERPs.
Notice that the SME effect occurs when the ERPs are
divided into stimulus that will, or will not, be
subsequently recalled. It is stimulus specific and the
effect is predicted because particular stimulus utilizes a
unique subset of the synaptic connections. In contrast,
the NSME effect is found when the ERPs are divided
into conditions that are, and conditions that are not,
preceded with other stimuli. It is less, or not, stimulus
specific because it depends on the synaptic depression
accumulated over previously presented stimuli. A SME
effect is predicted at all serial positions, including the
first serial position, whereas the NSME effect mainly
occurs as the difference between the first and the
following serial positions.
Finally, the DD-model assumes that high frequency
stimuli have a higher cell differentiation compared to
low frequency stimuli. That is high frequency stimuli is
predicted to have a lower neural activity, a more positive
ERP, and a better recall performance compared to low
frequency stimulus.
An experiment was setup to test the predictions, where
participants studied a short list of low and high
frequency words followed by a free recall test. ERPs and
free recall performance data were collected.

Mapping neural activity and cell differentiation
to ERP and performance
We limit the DD-model to account for the N400
component of the ERP-wave. Earlier components (i.e.,
N100, P200) are largely influenced by characteristic of
the stimulus, and is therefore of minor importance
because the goal here to capture more cognitive
processes. Furthermore, we are not interested in
discrimination studies where a P300 component typically
is evoked.
The mapping between ERP waves and the underlying
neural activities are complicated by a number of factors
such as the alignment of neural cells, and that different
components may map differently to activity. However,
in the DD-model it assumed that the amplitude, or the
degree of negative potential in the N400 component, is
proportional to neural activity. Evidence for this
assumption comes from simultaneous single cells
recording and scalp ERPs, for example during seizure
activity in cats (Caspers and Speckmann, 1969; Caspers
and Speckmann, 1972; Caspers, Speckmann and
Lehmenkuhler, 1980) and response to visual flashes in
recording in cortex and thalamus of rats (Coenen and
Eijkman, 1972).
The DD-model assumes that free recall performance is
directly proportional to cell differentiation, i.e., the
difference in neural activity between static and
suppressed cells.

Predictions
The DD-model makes the following predictions of the
ERP wave and free recall performance. It is assumed that
there is a stimuli dependent variability in cell
differentiation. Stimuli with a high cell differentiation
have a lower neural activity, a more positive N400

words, indicating a support for the DD-theory that other
mechanisms than rehearsal may play a role in the
primacy effect. A recency effect was found so that the
last serial position had a higher performance than items
in the middle of the list. This indicates that the distractor
task was not sufficiently long or strong to totally
eliminate the recency effect. Low frequency items were
better recalled than high frequency items. This effect can
largely be attributed to the mixed lists where earlier
studies have either found a low frequency advantage or
no frequency effect (Gregg, 1976).
ERP data. Electrodes along the midline of the brain
were chosen to study and grouped into four sets along
the posterior - anterior dimension. Each set consists of
the following six to eight electrodes, labeled according
to the EGI sensor net system, starting from the most
posterior to the most anterior set (occipital O = [68 67 73
78 72 77 76], parietal P = [32 81 54 55 80 61 62 79],
central C = [13 6 113 31 7 107 106], and frontal F = [19
16 10 20 11 4 12 5]).
A 2 X 3 X 2 X 4 X 4 ANOVA was conducted with the
following factors; frequency (high, low), serial position
(position 1, position 2-5, position 6), subsequent recall
performance (correct, incorrect), time windows (100-150
ms, 150-375 ms, 375-600 ms, and 600-825 ms), and
electrode sets (O, C, P, and F). All comparisons were
made with Greenhouse-Geisser corrections. The
following significant effects were obtained. A main
effect was obtained for time periods (F (2.34, 29.3) =
11.7, p = 0.00, MSE = 28.5). A main effect was found
for frequency (F (1, 9) = 4.8, p = 0.050, MSE = 31)
where high frequency obtained a more positive going
ERP than low frequency words from 200 ms
poststimulus. There was no main effect for subsequently
recalled words (see Figure 2).
An interaction effect was found for time periods and
serial position (F (2.8, 21.9) = 7.1, p = 0.001, MSE =
14.3). A planned t-test revealed a significantly more
negative potential (over the four sets of electrodes) for
serial position 1 compared to serial position 2-5 in the
375-600 (one-tailed, t (9) = 2.25, p = 0.022, MSE = 0.33)
and the 600-825 time periods (one-tailed, t (9) = 2.71, p
= 0.008, MSE = 0.50); however, there were no
significant difference for the 100-150 and 150-375 time
periods.
Discussion of the ERP data. Consistent with the DDmodel a negative subsequent memory effect was found
for the first serial position compared to the following
positions. That is the first serial position had a more
negative going ERP in combination with a better
performance compared to the following serial positions.
The DD-model interprets this as that the first serial
position has a larger neural activity (more negative N400
potential) and a stronger cell differentiation leading to
better recall performance.
Furthermore, consistent with the DD model the ERPs
for the high frequency words were more positive going
compared to the low frequency words. This finding is

Participants. Ten participants with a mean age of 26
(sd 7) were recruited. Five were woman and ten were
right handed.
Material. Four-hundred and eighty words were
collected from the Stockholm-Umeå-Corpus (SUC)
(Ejerhed and Källgren, 1997). Half of the words were
low frequency (i.e., 3 occurrences per million) and half
high frequency words (100 times or more per million).
The words were divided into 80 lists, each consisting of
6 words. One fourth of the lists were pure high
frequency words, one fourth pure low frequency words,
and the remaining half were mixed with intervening high
and low frequency words.
Procedure. Subjects were instructed to focus their
attention to the currently presented word and to avoid
rehearsal of previously presented words. This was done
to minimize rehearsal as an alternative account for the
primacy effect. Each word was presented for 1250 ms in
white on a black background. A “+” sign served as a
fixation point and was presented in a random interval
from 1500 to 2000 ms prior to stimulus onset. Following
the presentation of the six words a random number
signaled the start of a ten second distractor task consisted
of counting backwards in steps of three starting with the
presented number. This was followed by a 30 second
oral free recall test of the previously presented list. The
same procedure was repeated with the eighty lists and
each list was randomized for each subject.
ERP-data collection. ERP data was collected using a
129 electrode channel Geodesic Sensor Net (EGI. Inc
Eugene, OR Tucker, 1993) sampled every 4 ms and
filtered from 0.5 to 80 Hz. Epochs were extracted from
200 ms prior and 1000 ms following stimuli onset.
Channels in an epoch with ERPs exceeding an absolute
value of 50µV were automatically excluded and epochs
with more than 10 excluded channels were removed.
Furthermore, artefacts were removed using the ICA
algorithm as implemented in the EEGLAB software
(Delorme and Makeig, 2004). Average references were
used and baselines were removed.

Results
Free recall. A primacy effect was found so that the
first serial position had a higher percentage correct recall
compared to the third serial position (one tailed paired ttest, t (9) = 3.9, p = .001 < .05, MSE = .03).
Furthermore, the last serial position had a higher
percentage correct recall compared to the third serial
position (two tailed paired t-test, t (9) = 2.95, p = .011 <
0.05, MSE = .04). Finally, low frequency words were
better recalled than high frequency words (two tailed
paired t-test, t (9) = 3.5, p = .004 < 0.05, MSE = .019).
Discussion of the free recall data. As predicted, a
primacy effect was obtained despite the fact that subjects
were instructed not to rehearse previously presented

consistent with earlier studies (Smith and Halgren, 1987;
Rugg, 1990). This is interpreted as high frequency words
evoke less neural activity than low frequency words.
This occurs because high frequency words have a greater
cell differentiation leading to more synaptic depression
in high than low frequency static cells.
However no subsequent memory effect was obtained.
This finding was unexpected because earlier studies
typically obtained this effect (Sanquist et al., 1980;
Johnson, 1995; Rugg, 1995).. The reason for why no
subsequent memory effect was found is unclear.

Discussion
This paper has suggested a neurophysiologic based
model of ERPs and behavioral data. The model is based
on the empirical finding of cell differentiation and
synaptic plasticity. The neural activity is predicted to
decrease with cell differentiation because static cells
show a smaller increase in neural activity than the
decease in activity of suppressed cells as consequence of
synaptic depression. Items that are subsequently recalled
will have a larger cell differentiation and lower neural
activity than items that are not subsequently recalled
yielding a subsequent memory effect. Furthermore, the
cell differentiation is larger at the first serial position
leading to better performance, and more negative N400
potentials for the first serial position compared to the
following serial positions. This so called negative
subsequent memory effect was also obtained in the
experiment. However, no subsequent memory effect was
found.
The DD-model yields a different account of why the
neural activity diminishes during familiarization
compared to current theories. According to Desimone
(1996) familiarization of a stimulus causes a sharpening
of the neural representation of the static cells and at the
same reduces the pool of cells that respond to the
stimulus by diminishing the number of stimuli specific
cells. Both accounts share the idea of cell differentiation;
however, Desimone ’s account does not include synaptic
depression and furthermore it is a verbally stated theory
whereas the DD-model is a computationally
implemented model.
We hope that further empirical ERP and single cell
recording data in combination with computational
modeling will shed light in this complex and interesting
field.
