longer offer the best explanations. For this reason, the
attempt to falsify, that is, to search for refuting evidence, has
been advocated as the best way to test the truth of
hypotheses. Nonetheless the merits of falsification have
been questioned.

Abstract
Can people consistently attempt to falsify, that is, search for
refuting evidence, when testing the truth of hypotheses?
Experimental evidence indicates that people tend to search for
confirming evidence. We report two novel experiments that
show that people can consistently falsify when it is the only
helpful strategy. Experiment 1 showed that participants
readily falsified somebody else’s hypothesis. Their task was
to test a hypothesis belonging to an ‘imaginary participant’
and they knew it was a low quality hypothesis. Experiment 2
showed that participants were able to falsify a low quality
hypothesis belonging to an imaginary participant more readily
than their own low quality hypothesis. The results have
important implications for theories of hypothesis testing and
human rationality.

Problems for Falsification
Recent evidence indicates that people find falsification
psychologically difficult and unhelpful (Poletiek, 1996;
2001). Experimental studies in the psychological literature
have shown that people are rarely capable of falsification, if
indeed they find it possible at all (Poletiek, 1996). Early
studies found that people tended overwhelmingly to confirm
their hypotheses. They searched for evidence that was
consistent with their hypothesis and they avoided
inconsistent evidence. The tendency was termed
confirmation bias (e.g., Wason, 1960). Their failure to
attempt to falsify was interpreted as a failure to think
rationally.
Even great scientists appear to exhibit a confirmation bias,
as studies of the Apollo moon mission scientists testify (e.g.,
Mitroff, 1974). The hypotheses of these scientists have
stood the test of time, perhaps indicating that they were high
quality hypotheses with little chance of falsification in the
first place. People may find confirmation to be useful. In
fact, attempts to confirm may be a better strategy than
attempts to falsify, depending on the relationship between
the hypothesis and the general principle to be discovered
(Klayman & Ha, 1987). What then is the purpose of
falsification? We suggest that a major purpose of
falsification is to identify low quality hypotheses so that
they can be abandoned. For example, chess masters have
been shown to search for opponent moves that can falsify
their plans, which helps them to discover that the moves
they initially hypothesize to be good ones are mistaken
(Cowley & Byrne, 2004).
In this paper we outline the results of two experiments
that show that people can find falsification to be consistently
possible and helpful. The experiments were carried out
using Wason’s 2-4-6 task. This task is a standard test bed
for theories of hypothesis testing. The task presents a welldefined hypothesis testing situation for which the
relationship between a hypothesis and the available
evidence is precisely worked out (e.g., Klayman & Ha,

Hypothesis Testing and Falsification
People generate hypotheses to explain the workings of the
world around them. They generate hypotheses in everyday
social inference as well as in expert domains of scientific
inquiry. The human ability to generate hypotheses has led to
the accumulation of scientific knowledge. But it is the
ability to test whether or not these hypotheses correspond to
the evidence that leads to a true understanding.
Experimental
psychologists
and
epistemological
philosophers have long sought to understand how people
test their hypotheses (e.g., Popper, 1959; Wason, 1960;
Kuhn, 1962). The key research questions have been: what is
the best way to test hypotheses; how can people be
successful hypothesis testers; and do people sometimes
employ faulty hypothesis testing methods?
To address these questions cognitive psychologists
borrowed the crucial concepts of confirmation and
falsification from the philosophy of science. Hypothesis
testing was categorized either as confirming, that is, people
search for evidence that is consistent with a hypothesis, or
falsifying, that is, people search for evidence that is
inconsistent with a hypothesis. No matter how much
evidence confirms a theory, there is never absolute certainty
that it is correct (Popper, 1959). But if a major prediction of
a theory is proved false, it can be inferred that the theory is
incorrect, or at least incomplete. Falsification can safeguard
against having numerous theories that explain the same
phenomenon, each with some confirming evidence.
Theories that are falsified can be abandoned because they no

hypothesis because it is ascending in twos. This test is a
positive test. But the classification must also take account of
the intention of the hypothesis tester (Wetherick, 1962). The
positive test described is a confirming test only if the
participant intends the triple to conform to the
experimenter’s rule. If the participant expects a ‘yes’ from
the experimenter, they are attempting to confirm their
hypothesis, and they expect their hypothesis is correct. But
if the participant expects a ‘no’ from the experimenter, they
are attempting to falsify their hypothesis and they expect
their hypothesis is incorrect (Poletiek, 1996). Positive tests
can be intended to either confirm or falsify.
The same is true for negative tests. For example, when a
participant’s hypothesis is ‘numbers ascending in twos’ and
they generate the test triple 5-10-15, it is clear that 5-10-15
is inconsistent with the participant’s hypothesis because it is
not ascending in twos. This test is a negative test. However,
it is a falsifying test only if the participant intends the triple
to conform to the experimenter’s rule. If the participant
expects a ‘yes’ from the experimenter, then they expect a
triple that is inconsistent with their hypothesis to be
consistent with the experimenter’s rule, and so they expect
their hypothesis to be incorrect. But, if the participant
expects a ‘no’ from the experimenter, then they are in fact
attempting to confirm. They expect that the triple 5-10-15 is
inconsistent with their hypothesis ‘numbers ascending in
twos’ and they also expect that it is inconsistent with the
experimenter’s rule. The negative test in this instance is
intended to provide confirmation. Negative tests can be
intended to either confirm or falsify. These four sorts of
tests are considered the best classification scheme for
confirming and falsifying hypothesis tests in the 2-4-6 task
(e.g., Poletiek, 1996). Table 1 below shows an example of
each of the four test types for the low quality hypothesis,
‘even numbers ascending in twos’.

1987). In addition it has a well-defined logic for classifying
confirming and falsifying hypothesis testing.
First we outline the logical properties of the task. Second
we review some of the critical evidence from the task that
has led researchers to question the usefulness of falsification
(Klayman & Ha, 1987; Poletiek, 1996). Finally, we report a
version of the task that we have designed that provides
hypothesis testing situations in which participants must
falsify in order to discover the truth—the ‘imaginary
participant’ 2-4-6 task. We describe two experiments that
address the question of whether or not people can falsify a
hypothesis when it is rational to do so, that is, when the
hypothesis is untrue.

The 2-4-6 Task
Wason (1960) first empirically investigated people’s
hypothesis testing using the 2-4-6 task. Participants were
instructed to discover a rule the experimenter had in mind
that the number triple 2-4-6 conforms to. The participant is
analogous to the scientist and the experimenter’s rule is
analogous to the law of nature to be discovered.
Participants are asked to discover the rule by generating
their own number triples. For each triple they are told ‘yes’
or ‘no’ by the experimenter as to whether or not it conforms
to the rule or not. Each triple is taken to be a test of what the
participant hypothesizes the rule to be. For example,
participants tend to focus on the salient features of the 2-4-6
triple and generate hypotheses such as ‘even numbers
ascending in twos’. They propose triples such as 10-12-14
and 16-18-20. For each one of these triples they receive a
‘yes’ response from the experimenter. But the
experimenter’s rule is the deliberately general rule, ‘any
ascending numbers’. Hence, a triple such as 10-12-14
receives a ‘yes’ because it is consistent with the rule to be
discovered (‘any ascending numbers’) as well as the
hypothesis under test (‘even numbers ascending in twos’).
When each participant thinks they have discovered the rule
they have to announce what they think it is. Typically
participants announce an incorrect rule such as ‘even
numbers ascending in twos’. Only 21% of participants
announced the correct rule first time round (Wason, 1960).
This result has been replicated many times (e.g., Tweney et
al., 1980). The tendency for people to seek out information
consistent with their hypotheses and avoid inconsistent
information was termed confirmation bias. We turn now to
the logic of classifying confirming and falsifying tests in the
task.

Initial classifications of hypothesis testing as confirming
and falsifying tests were equated with positive tests (tests
that were consistent with the participant’s hypothesis) and
negative tests (tests that were inconsistent with the
participant’s hypothesis) respectively (Wason, 1960). For
example, when a participant’s hypothesis is ‘numbers
ascending in twos’ and they generate the test triple 3-5-7, it
is clear that 3-5-7 is consistent with the participant’s

This task allowed us to control the precise relationship
between the hypothesis under test and the truth (the
experimenter’s rule). The task allows us to give participants
a low quality hypothesis. It must be falsified using negative
falsifying tests in order to discover the truth. The low
quality hypothesis ‘even numbers ascending in twos’ is
embedded within the truth ‘any ascending numbers’.
Because the hypothesis is less general than the true rule,
participants must falsify to find out that it is not the true
rule.
The embedded relationship between a hypothesis and the
experimenter’s rule may influence a participant’s potential
to falsify. The embedded situation is one of five possible
relationships that can exist between a participant’s
hypothesis and an experimenter’s rule (Klayman & Ha,
1987). The relationships concern how much the
participant’s hypothesis and the experimenter’s rule overlap
with one another. Three relationships are relevant to our
experiments.
The first relationship, outlined in Figure 1 (a), is the
embedded relationship characteristic of the 2-4-6 task. The
rule is ‘any ascending numbers’ and the participant’s
hypothesis is ‘even numbers ascending in twos’. We
adopted this situation for our imaginary participant 2-4-6
task. Participant’s were given ‘even numbers ascending in
twos’ as Peter’s hypothesis and the experimenter’s rule they
had to discover was ‘any ascending numbers’. The only way
to intentionally falsify is to use a negative falsifying test.
For example, consider a participant who generates the triple
5-10-15 (which is a negative test as ascending in five or odd
numbers is inconsistent with Peter’s hypothesis ‘even
numbers ascending in twos’). They expect it to be
consistent with the true rule. They will receive a ‘yes’ from
the experimenter, because 5-10-15 is consistent with ‘any
ascending numbers’. They can infer that Peter’s hypothesis
about ‘evenness’ or ‘ascending in twos’ cannot be true. It is
not possible to falsify the hypothesis by generating a
positive falsifying test.
Consider a participant who tries to falsify by generating
the positive falsifying test, 24-26-28 (which is a positive test
because it is consistent with Peter’s hypothesis ‘even
numbers ascending in twos’, but they expect it to be
inconsistent with the true rule). When they receive a ‘yes’
from the experimenter they cannot infer that Peter’s
hypothesis pertaining to properties of ‘evenness’ or
‘ascending in twos’ is untrue. Although the positive test
intended to falsify, it cannot. It is consistent with both the
hypothesis and the true rule.
In the second type of embedded relationship, illustrated
in Figure 1 (b), the participant’s hypothesis is more general
than the true rule. Consider a case where Peter’s hypothesis
is ‘numbers ascending in twos’ and the true rule is ‘even
numbers ascending in twos’. The true rule is embedded
within Peter’s hypothesis. It is possible to falsify by
generating a positive falsifying test. A participant may
generate the triple 3-5-7 (which is a positive test as it is
consistent with the hypothesis ‘ascending in twos’), but they
expect that it is not consistent with the true rule. This time

triple such as 5-10-15, and they expect it to conform to the
experimenter’s rule. If they receive the feedback that the
triple is consistent with the experimenter’s rule, then they
know their hypothesis ‘even numbers ascending in twos’ is
untrue. The ability to generate negative falsifying tests is
pivotal to the debate about whether people can falsify in a
useful way.
Negative confirming tests may have been misidentified
as falsifying tests in early studies of hypothesis testing. In
one study participants were given the standard 2-4-6 task
and they had to come up with their best guess about what
the experimenter’s rule was. They were presented with the
number triple 2-4-6 and the experimenter’s rule was the
usual ‘any ascending numbers’ rule (Poletiek, 1996).
Participants were given instructions either to ‘test’,
‘confirm’,
or ‘falsify’. For the ‘test’ and ‘confirm’
conditions, the majority of tests fell into the positive
confirming category (86% and 80% respectively), and few
tests fell into the negative falsifying category (0% and 3%
respectively). Participants in the ‘falsify’ condition were
instructed to ‘try to test in such a way as to get your
hypothesis about the rule rejected’ (Poletiek, 1996; p.454).
The majority of tests in this condition fell into the two
confirming categories, the positive confirming and negative
confirming categories (32% and 54% respectively).
Although the participants proposed test triples that were
negative tests, in fact they intended them to confirm. It was
concluded that people do not seem to be able to make sense
of falsification.
In our experiments we have examined whether people
naturally tend to falsify their hypotheses in some situations
(Cowley and Byrne, 2005). For example, a teacher who
knows a student’s hypothesis is incorrect may provide a
counterexample to it. A scientist who believes another
scientist’s hypothesis is incorrect may design an experiment
to falsify it. In the experiments we describe, we tested
whether people can readily falsify low-quality hypotheses
that have been generated by others. Existing evidence
indicates that participants can understand the value of
negative falsifying tests of a hypothesis when the tests are
generated by somebody else (Kareev & Halberstadt, 1993).
Our question is the opposite: can participants generate
negative falsifying tests when the hypothesis has been
produced by somebody else? We constructed a version of
the 2-4-6 task in which participants tested someone else’s
hypothesis rather than their own.

The ‘Imaginary Participant’ 2-4-6 Task
We constructed an ‘imaginary participant’ version of the 24-6 task in which participants were told that an individual
called Peter was asked to discover a rule that an
experimenter had in mind, which the triple 2-4-6 conforms
to (for details see Cowley and Byrne, 2005). The
experimenter’s rule was the standard ‘any ascending
numbers’ rule. Participants were not required to generate the
hypothesis themselves. Instead, they were asked to test
Peter’s hypothesis.

514

years. No participants had taken courses in the philosophy
of science.
They were assigned at random to one of four groups (n =
16 in each). They were told that an individual called Peter
was asked to discover a rule that a researcher had in mind,
to which the number sequence 2-4-6 conforms. Two of the
groups were told that Peter hypothesises the rule to be ‘even
numbers ascending in twos’ (a low quality hypothesis). One
of these groups was told what the experimenter’s rule was
(‘any ascending numbers’), and so they knew the hypothesis
was a low-quality one, and the other group was not told
what the experimenter’s rule was. The other two groups
were told that Peter’s hypothesis is ‘any ascending numbers’
(a high quality hypothesis). Again, one group was told the
experimenter’s rule (‘any ascending numbers’), and the
other group was not. Participants in all four groups, low
quality known, low quality unknown, high quality known
and high quality unknown, were instructed to generate
number triples of their own. They had to test Peter’s
hypothesis in such a way as to help him discover if his rule
was the experimenter’s rule (for further details see Cowley
and Byrne, 2005).

they receive a ‘no’ from the experimenter, because 3-5-7
contains odd numbers. They can infer that the hypothesis is
not the rule because it may pertain to numbers with the
property of ‘evenness’. Now consider a participant who tries
to falsify by generating a negative falsifying test such as 510-15. This time when they receive a ‘no’ from the
experimenter they may not infer that Peter’s hypothesis
‘numbers ascending in twos’ is untrue. The triple is
inconsistent with their hypothesis and the true rule and so it
cannot discriminate between them (Klayman & Ha, 1987).

Figure 1: Three relationships between Peter’s hypothesis
and the true rule in the 2-4-6 Task
The third situation, illustrated in Figure 1 (c), is when
the hypothesis is the same as the true rule, for example,
Peter’s hypothesis ‘any ascending numbers’ completely
overlaps the true rule ‘any ascending numbers’. When a
participant generates a positive test triple such as 24-26-28,
even if it is intended to falsify, it receives a ‘yes’ response.
The test leads to confirmation. And negative test triples such
as 6-4-2 receive a ‘no’ response (because descending
numbers are not consistent with the true rule ‘any ascending
numbers’). When a descending triple receives a ‘no’ it does
not help the participant infer that their hypothesis ‘any
ascending numbers’ is certainly the true rule. It is not
possible to falsify a true hypothesis.

Participants were tested individually and they recorded
their number triples on a recording sheet which had five
columns in which they wrote the triple, their reason for
choosing the triple, whether they expected the triple to
conform to Peter’s hypothesis (i.e., is it a positive or
negative test), whether they expected the triple to conform
to the experimenter’s rule (i.e., did they intend to confirm
or falsify). In the last column the experimenter (the first
author) wrote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as to whether or not the triple did
in fact conform to the rule. They were asked to announce
when they were highly confident if their triples would show
Peter if his rule was the experimenter’s rule.
Results
The results show that people can consistently falsify
hypotheses. In the low quality known condition, Peter’s
hypothesis is a low quality embedded one, ‘even numbers
ascending in twos’ and the participants know that the rule to
be discovered is in fact ‘any ascending numbers’.
Participants found it possible to falsify in this condition.
90% of their tests were falsifying ones. One example of a
negative falsifying test triple generated by one of the
participants in this condition was: 15-17-19. They said they
expected 15-17-19 not to be an instance of the hypothesis
they were testing (even numbers ascending in twos) yet they
expected it to conform to the experimenter’s rule (any
ascending numbers). Each participant produced at least one
negative falsifying test and more negative falsifying tests
were generated in this condition than in any of the other
conditions, low quality unknown (22%), high quality
known, (0%), and high quality unknown (6%, chi2 = 18.325
(1), p < .0001). Table 2 presents the percentages of each test
type for all conditions.

Experiment 1
The aim of the experiment was to test whether people can
falsify hypotheses consistently (see Cowley and Byrne,
2005). We gave participants a version of the 2-4-6 task with
the crucial difference that their task was to test someone
else’s hypothesis. We presented some of them with an
alternative hypothesis in addition to the hypothesis to be
tested, in that we told some of them not only about Peter’s
hypothesis but also about the experimenter’s rule. In so
doing, we placed participants in a superior knowledge state
much like a teacher who must present a counterexample to a
student in order to show the student that a hypothesis is
inaccurate. Participants must falsify and announce that Peter
will know from this evidence that his hypothesis is
inaccurate. Participants falsifying under these conditions can
show they understand the implication of the test result if
they demonstrate they intend to falsify.
The participants were sixty four members of the general
public who volunteered and were paid a nominal fee, or who
were undergraduate students and participated for course
credits. There were 50 women and 14 men whose ages
ranged from 15 years to 73 years, with a mean age of 35

Participants could abandon the hypothesis, that is, they
announced that the hypothesis was not the researcher’s rule
when they had finished testing triples, or they could endorse
it, that is, they announced that the hypothesis was the
researcher’s rule when they had finished testing triples.
Participants tended to abandon the low quality hypothesis
rather than endorse it when it was Peter’s hypothesis (62%
versus 38%); in contrast, they tended to endorse the low
quality hypothesis rather than abandon it when it was their
own (75% versus 25%), as Table 4 shows. The difference
was reliable (chi2 = 4.571 (1), p = .016).

The result that 90% of the triples that participants generated
were negative falsifying hypothesis tests shows that people
can indeed falsify in some circumstances. What aspect of
the low quality known condition facilitates falsification?
One possibility is that people have a tendency to falsify
someone else’s hypothesis rather than one’s own. Often,
real life scientific hypothesis testing proceeds by attempting
to falsify another scientist’s hypothesis. Our second
experiment tested whether people tend to falsify other
people’s hypotheses more than their own.

Experiment 2

Table 4: Percentages of abandoned and endorsed hypotheses

The experiment was designed to discover whether
participants falsify a low quality hypothesis when it
belonged to someone else compared to when it belonged to
themselves. Thirty two people who were members of the
general public volunteered and were paid a nominal fee.
There were 23 women and 9 men. Their ages ranged from
20 years to 75 years, with a mean age of 51 years. No
participants had taken courses in the philosophy of science.
There were two conditions. In one condition the low
quality embedded hypothesis was identified as belonging to
the ‘imaginary participant’ Peter. Participants were told that
Peter’s hypothesis is ‘even numbers ascending in twos’. In
the other condition the identical hypothesis was identified as
belonging to the participant. Participants were told that
‘your hypothesis is even numbers ascending in twos’.
Participants were not told what the experimenter’s rule was
in either condition. The recording sheet and procedure were
the same as in experiment 1.

The results suggest that people falsify a hypothesis

Conclusion
Our experiments demonstrate that people can consistently
engage in falsification, that is, they can generate negative
tests that genuinely falsify a hypothesis. They can falsify in
the most difficult hypothesis testing situations, that is, when
the hypothesis is low quality and it is embedded within the
true rule. They falsified with the intention that their chosen
tests would falsify. They appear to be aware of the
implications of their test choice because they announced
that the imaginary participant would realize from the test

Results
Participants tended to falsify a hypothesis belonging to
someone else more often than the same hypothesis
belonging to themselves. Participants who tested Peter’s
hypothesis generated more negative falsifying tests than
participants who tested their own hypothesis (32% versus
7%), although the difference was not reliable (chi2 = 2.667
(4), p = .307), as Table 3 shows.

results that a hypothesis was low quality (pace Poletiek,
1996).
The experiments suggest that people can falsify other
people’s hypotheses more readily than their own even
without knowledge that the hypothesis is low quality or
knowledge about what the relationship between the
hypothesis and the truth is (pace Klayman & Ha, 1989).
They tended not to abandon a low quality hypothesis when
it was their own, compared to when it belonged to someone
else. Participants may be able to rely on a falsification
strategy in a rational way to test somebody else’s hypothesis
but not their own. We are currently examining the role of
alternative hypotheses in helping people to falsify (Cowley
and Byrne, 2005).
