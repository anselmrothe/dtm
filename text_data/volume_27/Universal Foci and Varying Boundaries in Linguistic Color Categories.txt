we relied on a large set of color naming data from unwritten

we found were genuine universals (Kay & Regier, 2003).

  those data, based on Berinmo foci (bottom panel). 90% of
                      chips are correctly labeled.
We also fit the model to Berinmo in a slightly different
manner: by assuming that the 5 foci were located at the
black, white, red, yellow, and green WCS peaks from Study
1, rather than the Berinmo foci which fall 1 chip away from
them. The best-fitting parameter values were: SD(black) =
5.5, SD(white) = 3.5, SD(red) = 6.5, SD(yellow) = 8.5,
SD(green) = 12.7. This time, with foci not drawn from the
language itself, the fit was not quite as good: 84% of chips
were correctly classified. These results suggest that the
rather small differences in the locations of foci across
languages may account for some cross-linguistic variation in
category boundaries.
