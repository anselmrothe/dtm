                              Abstract
  Peak shift effects produced with complex pattern stimuli are
  influenced by the level of spatial variability over successive
  presentations of the same training stimulus. This effect, now
  demonstrated in humans and animals, poses a significant
  problem for past models of peak shift, which assume that the
  spatial location of the stimulus components will not influence
  post-discrimination generalization. Here we present a model
  based on contemporary elemental associative theory which
  can accurately account for the effect, and furthermore does so
  without any of the assumptions of dimensionality on which                Figure 1. Example of ‘icon’ stimuli used in training.
  previous models of peak shift depend. In so doing, we hope to
  further illuminate the nature of dimensionality, i.e. what
  makes a dimension a dimension.

  Conclusions
  The model presented in this paper can account both for the
  effect of spatial variation in icon placement on the post-
  discrimination gradients obtained, and for variations in the
  degree to which our artificial dimension approximates a real
  one. This makes it the most robust model of its type.
  Furthermore the model avoids the assumptions of
