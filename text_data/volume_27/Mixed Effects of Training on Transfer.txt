  It is important to note that, although many studies have used
more than one transfer session, the number of transfer trials was
never greater than one session of our experiment. Again, Hillstrom
and Logan’s Experiment 1 is the exception, with the equivalent of
five of our sessions of transfer (Hillstrom and Logan, 1998).
