At the sensory level, the human auditory system may be
described throw two types of pathway: “ascending” and
“descending” auditory pathways. Ascending pathways carry
the auditory message from receptive hair cells in the cochlea
to the primary auditory cortex. Descending pathways
extending from the auditory cortex to the periphery through
the superior olivary complex constitute a sort of inhibitory
filter (Khalfa & Collet, 1996) which may play a role in
degraded speech comprehension. The existence of a central
influence on the sensory level by means of efferent feedback
pathways has been highlighted with the investigation of the
medial olivocochlear bundle (MOCB). It is possible to
explore the MOCB in a simple and non invasive way
through contralateral suppression of otoacoustic emissions
(OAEs), sounds produced by the outer hair cells of the
cochlea (Collet, Kemp, Veuillet, Duclaux, Moulin &
Morgnon, 1990). Important interindividual variability in
normal hearing subjects was also observed by the same
authors when assessing the functionality of the MOCB.
Though the precise functional role of the MOCB remains
unclear, several studies have suggested its involvement in
speech intelligibility in degraded conditions. A correlation
between the functionality of MOCB and the detection
threshold of pure tones present in noise was first reported by
Micheyl and Collet (1996). Giraud, Garnier, Micheyl, Lina,
Chays and Chéry-Croze (1997), also reported that MOCB
activation via contralateral noise stimulation improved
speech-in-noise intelligibility in normal hearing subjects.
More recently Kumar and Vanaja (2004) suggested a
correlation between the contralateral suppression of evoked
OAEs and speech identification scores at certain
signal/noise ratios.
However speech comprehension is likely to benefit during
auditory sentence comprehension from higher level
knowledge such as lexical knowledge stored in the mental
lexicon or contextual information. Interactive theories of
speech perception postulate that several sources interact
during perceptual analysis (McClelland & Elman, 1986).
The aim of our study was to characterize involvement of
high and low-level processes during the comprehension of
speech in degraded conditions. To study these mechanisms

Abstract
In the present study we explore the implication of high and
low level mechanisms in degraded (time-reversed) speech
comprehension in normal hearing subjects. In experiment 1
we compared the loss of intelligibility due to the increasing
size of reversion windows in both words and pseudowords.
Results showed that words are generally reconstructed better
than pseudowords, suggesting the existence of a lexical
benefit in degraded speech restoration. Moreover, there was
greater variability between individuals when reconstructing
pseudowords than words. In experiment 2, we demonstrated
that this interindividual variability correlated with the
subjects’ medial olivocochlear bundle functionality. These
experiments highlight the importance of low-level auditory
mechanisms in degraded speech restoration. In a third
experiment, we performed ERP recordings during an auditory
sentence comprehension task in which sentences could
contain partially reversed words. Results suggest that both an
automatic auditory violation detection component, the
mismatch negativity (MMN), and a subsequent negative
frontal wave (N600) were present. Moreover, only this later
wave was modulated by the size of the reversion. Together,
these results put forward the existence of major
interindividual variability in the capacity to reconstruct
degraded speech, which correlates with the physiological
properties of the auditory system. In addition, our results also
suggest the existence of multiple higher-level strategies that
can compensate on-line for the lack of information caused by
speech degradation.

Introduction
Understanding speech is fast and automatic; this process is a
daily task achieved without any difficulty although it
involves cognitive functions which are both numerous and
complex. The intelligibility of speech depends both on the
quality of the emitted signal and on the ability of the
cognitive system to process this signal. To understand
spoken messages requires the complementary engagement
of low-level (auditory) and high-level mechanisms (e.g.,
lexical knowledge, contextual integration).

we manipulated the intelligibility of speech signals by
applying temporal reversions on different-sized windows
(i.e., flipping the signal on its horizontal axis). Reversed
speech has the particularity that it maintains the physical
characteristics of speech such as the distribution frequency
of sounds, their global amplitude and, to some extent, their
temporal and rhythmic characteristics. The main difference
between speech and reversed speech lies in the
coarticulations which are totally distorted in the reversed
signal. Thus, reversed speech is unpronounceable though to
some extent it remains understandable. Saberi and Perrott
(1999) demonstrated that it is possible to reconstruct locally
reversed English speech (for comparable results see
Greenberg & Araï, 2001 and Meunier, Cenier, Barkat &
Magrin-Chagnolleau, 2002, for results on French). All these
studies applied time reversions according to arbitrarily
augmenting time-windows (20 ms, 40 ms, 60 ms…). For the
present work, time reversions were based on the syllable
unit as it has been identified as a privileged unit for lexical
access in French (Content, Dumay & Frauenfelder, 2000).
In experiment 1, we measured the accuracy in restoring
single words and pseudowords to quantify the lexical effects
during this process. In experiment 2 auditory measurements
were made to test the implication of auditory pathways in
the reconstruction phenomenon. Finally we completed our
results with electrophysiological measurements to
characterize the implication of high-level processes.

phonotactics. All 240 items were recorded in a soundproof
room by a native French speaker. We applied five kinds of
reversion to the items:
 Condition R0: no reversion applied.
 Condition R0.5: first half syllable reversed.
 Condition R1: first syllable reversed.
 Condition R1.5: first syllable and a half reversed.
 Condition R2: whole item reversed.
The half syllable was defined as the half in terms of the
duration of a syllable.
Experimental procedure Participants faced a computer
screen (PC type) and heard the stimuli delivered binaurally
via headphones. The presentation order of the 240 stimuli
was randomized across subjects. The participants had to
type on a computer keyboard what they had understood.
Participants 50 native French speakers aged between 18
and 25 participated in this study. None had any auditory
problems.

Results
Results were obtained by comparing the subjects’
transcriptions to the original words or pseudowords. Taken
as a whole, the percentage of intelligibility decreased with
increasing distortion. The average reconstruction score was
97.3% for condition R0; 79.65% for R0.5; 51.15% for R1;
2.85% for R1.5 and 1.81% for R2. Figure 1 shows
intelligibility rates for words and pseudowords as a function
of the reversion size.

Experiment 1: Behavioural measures
Materials and methods
Stimuli Word stimuli consisted of 120 French nouns. All
were common disyllabic words. They were selected
according to two main criteria: their frequency (High or
Low) and their number of phonological neighbours (Many
or Few). (Lexique database, New, Palier, Ferrand & Matos,
2001). For example the word /ballon/ (balloon) is a high
frequency noun (f=4.39) that has many phonological
neighbours (20) (e.g., /vallon/, /baron/, /baton/…). We
crossed Frequency and Neighbour factors in order to create
4 categories of 30 experimental nouns each. For each
category Table 1 gives the mean and the standard deviation
of each factor (frequency and number of phonological
neighbours).

The subjects performed better overall with words than
with pseudowords (F(1,49)=158.5; p<.0001). For both
categories of stimuli the degradation of the first half syllable
(R0.5) gave high scores of restoration (average 79.65%).
When a little part of the first syllable is degraded the
cognitive system is able to reconstruct the signal. When
only the first syllable is degraded scores turned around 50%
as the second syllable was well identified. However, the
degradation of one syllable and a half (R1.5) gave disastrous
reconstruction scores (below 3%). When the distortion is
longer than the syllable the system seems to be unable to
reconstruct neither the first syllable nor the second one
which is only partly damaged. This tends to confirm the

main role of the syllable as a unit in French comprehension
processes.
Comparing words and pseudowords in condition R1 (first
syllable degraded) we observed that the first syllable is
sometimes reconstructed only in words (so the whole word
is found): 54.8% of words are reconstructed. In
pseudowords the first syllable is almost never reconstructed
(47.5% of reconstruction) moreover the degradation disturbs
the well understanding of the second one (though it is
intact).
In addition we observed that for pseudowords restitution
participants tend to answer a real word phonological similar
to the target instead of the right pseudoword. In average
participants answer by a word for 3.65% (SD= 3.76) of the
120 pseudowords. For example the word “parfum” was
frequently given as an answer of the target stimulus “rafin”.
This result shows the robustness of lexical effects in a non
lexical task such as pseudowords restoration.
Furthermore we observed both a frequency effect
(F(1,49)=17.12; p=.0001) and a neighbour effect
(F(1,49)=20.15; p<.0001) on word reconstruction. The most
frequent words were better reconstructed whatever the
inversion degree was and words with fewer neighbours were
also better reconstructed. The interaction between
Frequency and Neighbour was significant only for condition
R1. This interaction indicates that when the first syllable is
distorted the number of neighbours is the first criterion that
could modify the reconstruction process. A high frequency
could thus help the reconstruction but only for words with
few phonological competitors.
The fact that pseudowords were more difficult to
reconstruct than words seems coherent because
pseudowords do not have any representation stored in the
mental lexicon. Consequently, they do not benefit as much
from lexical help. Overall performances for pseudowords
were very homogenous over participants for most conditions
(see Figure 2). However the condition R0.5 showed a large
interindividual variability. In this condition, some subjects
were undisturbed by the inversion whereas others were
deeply perturbed and failed the reconstruction task:
performances ranged from 47.9% to 91.7% of correct
reconstruction (mean=71.2%, SD=10.4).

72.9% to 97.9%; mean= 88.2% SD=5.67). Moreover,
speakers who had difficulties in reconstructing pseudowords
in condition R0.5 (63.2% of reconstruction for the 25 lowest
and 78.5% for the 25 highest performing participants) had
no trouble in reconstructing words in the same reversed
condition (89.4% of words were reconstructed against
86.6% for higher score participants). The correlation
between the performance for word and pseudoword
reconstruction was not significant. This intriguing result
suggests that lexical help can to some extent compensate
poor performance on pseudoword reconstruction.
Pseudowords are considered as speech and thus general
phonotactics apply (giving cues to the identity of the
contiguous phonemes) but they do not have any
representation stored in the mental lexicon. Consequently,
reversed pseudoword reconstruction is primarily based on
auditory information. So why did the subjects – all young
and without any auditory problems – present such varied
performances? Given that descending auditory pathways
could interfere in speech perception and that their
contribution is unequal among subjects, we can formulate
the hypothesis that the MOCB functionality may be
responsible for the behavioural results we observed. In order
to answer this question we compared the results obtained for
pseudoword reconstruction and auditory performance in
each participant.

Experiment 2: Auditory measurements
Two groups of 10 persons each were then formed from the
subjects in experiment 1 according to their performance for
pseudowords reconstruction in condition R0.5 (i.e., the
condition showing the largest variability). The HP group
(High Performance) was composed of the 10 persons who
showed the best performances (m=83.3%). The LP group
(Low Performance) was composed of the 10 subjects who
showed the lowest performances (m=50%). We measured
the functionality of the MOCB of these selected subjects
(uncrossed pathway) in a soundproof room. OAEs were
recorded according to the method of Bray and Kemp using
the Otodynamics ILO88 measuring device. A miniaturized
microphone placed in the external ear canal delivered
acoustic stimulations (clicks) and recorded responses. For
each participant we recorded OAEs for 20 ms after clicks
delivery with and without a broadband noise (30dBSL)
applied in the contralateral ear. We calculated the
contralateral suppression of OAEs in each ear and the
corresponding lateralization (for details see Veuillet, Collet
& Bazin, 1999). The tests lasted one hour.

complementary information about the temporal dynamics of
high and low-level processes.

Results and Discussion
Results are clear cut: the HP group showed better
contralateral suppressions in both ears than did the LP
group. Table 2 shows the mean and the standard deviation
of contralateral suppressions of OAEs in the right and left
ears respectively, for each group of subjects. The last
column indicates the lateralization (Contralateral
suppression of OAEs on right ear minus left ear).

Materials and Methods
Stimuli 200 experimental disyllabic words selected from
Lexique were included in 200 unpredictable context
sentences (e.g., Les parents choisissent des prénoms pour
leurs enfants / Parents choose first names for their
children). We randomized the position of the target noun in
the sentence (position 1, 2 or 3). Recordings and time
inversions were identical to experiment 1. In each sentence
only the target noun could be reversed. We presented target
words in sentences to avoid the surprise effect provoked by
the stimulus arrival that modify EEG recording.

The ANOVA analysis ran on lateralisation showed a

ear than LP group.

Experimental procedure Electroencephalographic activity
was continuously recorded using a geodesic cap (Geodesic
Sensor Net™), fitted with 65 soft electrodes (Ag/AgCl)
referenced to the vertex. Subjects wore headphones
(SONY® MDR-Q22LP) binaurally delivering stimuli. Scalp
voltages were amplified with a high input impedance
amplifier (200 MΩ, Net Amps ™, Electrical Geodesics
INC.); amplified analogue voltages (0.1-200 Hz bandpass)
were sampled at 500 Hz. We tested five reversed conditions
as in experiment 1.
Each participant was seated in front of a computer screen
where general instructions were displayed. They heard the
200 sentences one by one and had to repeat each of them to
the experimenter who recorded the answers. They did not
type the answer as in Experiment 1 in order to move as little
as possible to avoid motor artifacts on the EEG recording.
The recording lasted 1 hour.

Figure 3: Lateralization for the two groups of subjects.
Indeed auditory areas are asymmetric and the peripheral
auditory system reflects this asymmetry. An efficient
MOCB is characterised by a large inhibitory power and by
the lateralization (for right handed people, the more negative
the lateralization the more efficient the MOCB).
Auditory measurements demonstrated clearly that the HP
group had a better MOCB and was more right lateralized
than the LP group. We found a correlation between
behavioural performances and the lateralization of the
subjects (r=0.7; p<.001). It suggests that the stronger the
asymmetry of the auditory system the better the behavioural
performances. This demonstrates the link between the
MOCB and the cognitive processes of reversed speech
restoration. The role of the MOCB could be to filter the
damaged signal in order to highlight perception of those
elements which are pertinent. The MOCB would be a sort of
adapting mechanism of the ear to situations in which the
signal is perceived.
Taken together, experiments 1 and 2 throw light on the
participation of high and low-level mechanisms in reversed
speech restoration.

Preprocessing of EEG recordings We analyzed the
amplitude of the surface current (in µV) of ERP markers
identified in temporal windows and the percentage of nouns
correctly reconstructed. EEG recordings were segmented
from 100 ms before to 900 ms after the onset of the target
noun. A low-pass 30 Hz filter was applied, segments were
re-referenced to an average-reference, and then a baseline
correction was applied, based on the first 100 ms. Segments
were averaged within each condition for each participant.
Prior to averaging we rejected EEG portions contaminated
by eye movements, eye-blinks, or transient amplifier
saturation. The rate of rejection due to artifacts was about
10%. Further analyses are based on the data of 16 subjects.
Analyze of EEG recordings We selected seven scalp
regions (Central, Central frontal, Right anterior, Left
anterior, Central posterior, Right posterior, Left posterior)
covering the whole scalp. After visual inspection of the
Grand-Average waveforms, we identified two timewindows comprising the two main observed markers. The

allow guessing of the target noun (scores were inferior to

may help the reconstruction task.

first time-window extends from 100 ms to 300 ms. The
second one ranges from 400 ms to 750 ms. We performed
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the
factors: Time Window, Spatial region, Reversion and
Syllable.

Results
We identified two waves characterized by two different
peaks and latencies. In the first time-window we observed a
negative fronto-central wave peaking around 180 ms. This
wave can be categorized as the well-documented MMN
(MisMatch Negativity) first described by Näätänen in 1978.
According to the ANOVA including 7 spatial regions and 5
reversion conditions the wave was anterior (F(6,90)=3.76;
p<.005) and appeared only for the reversed stimuli
conditions and not for the control (F(4,60)=3.5; p<.05). This
observation confirms former results from the literature
showing that the MMN reflects the early detection of an
auditory incongruity (Näätänen, 1990). Whenever a
reversion was present in the target-word we observed a
complete MMN independent of the reversion size.
In the second time-window we observed a globallynegative frontal wave, peaking around 600 ms. To our
knowledge, this wave was not yet described in the literature
so we will refer to it as the N600. The ANOVA showed an
interaction between the spatial region and the reversion
(F(24,360)=1.95; p<.01). To go further, we tested the
syllable effect and found an interaction between the spatial
region and the syllable (F(1,15)=7.8; p<.05) (Figure 4). It
appears clear that the N600 is present only over frontal
regions and only for reversions larger than one syllable.

reconstruction in condition R1.5. The electrophysiological

General discussion
The aim of the study was to understand the respective
influence of high and low-level mechanisms that underlie
the cognitive reconstruction of degraded speech. Our results
suggest that descending auditory pathways may intervene
significantly during this process: more precisely, activity in
MOCB may be one of the neurophysiological mechanisms
participating in restoration process. In addition, high-level
knowledge is activated to help the reconstruction. Speech
comprehension is the result of an interaction between lowlevel mechanisms and elaborated knowledge stored in the
mental lexicon. In experiment 1 we saw that the system was
able to reconstruct speech signal to some extent. However
reversed words and pseudowords are not reconstructed in
the same way. For words both high and low-level
mechanisms intervene, often resulting in successful
comprehension. Both phonological neighbours and the
frequency of noun effects suggest the implication of highlevel mechanisms (lexical search) in word reconstruction.
These mechanisms may either improve the signal
reconstruction in a top-down scheme or more probably
compensate for the lack of information if the low-level
mechanisms fail to reconstruct the signal.
Pseudowords are not listed in the mental lexicon however;
high-level mechanisms are still involved as demonstrated by
the restitution of real words phonologically similar to
pseudowords. In addition, our results showed a syllable
effect. As long as the damaged information is shorter or
equal to one syllable subjects still understand, even if the
target item exhibits numerous phonological neighbours.
When the distortion gets larger than one syllable, the
reconstruction becomes more difficult. These results are
consistent with the hypothesis that the syllable could be a
perceptual unit in French.

The N600 was modulated by the nature of the stimulus:
When the reversion increases, the amplitude of the N600
increases too. The N600 seems to characterize high-level
processes activated during speech reconstruction, whereas
the MMN would reflect the detection of a transient
degradation occurring in speech (Figure 5).
Lastly, the behavioural results from experiment 3 showed
the same pattern as in experiment 1. The more the noun was
distorted the more difficult it was to reconstruct it. However,
we noticed better performances when words were presented
in a sentential context than when they were isolated. For
condition R0.5 the reconstruction scores were 99.2% for
words in sentences and 88.1% for isolated words and for
condition R1 the reconstruction scores were respectively
807

Another interesting finding is the large variability
observed between normal hearing persons for pseudoword
reconstruction. For the reversion of the first half syllable
some of the participants had no trouble in reconstructing
pseudowords whereas others largely failed. Moreover,
behavioural results and MOCB functionality of the subjects
correlate significantly (experiment 2). This suggests
implication of the efferent auditory pathways in reversed
speech reconstruction. Reversed speech intelligibility seems
to be linked with functioning MOCBs. The MOCB seems to
modify the properties of auditory fibres in order to improve
the ability of the auditory system to focus on pertinent
information included in the percept. However, we did not
find any correlation between auditory measurements and
word reconstruction. The variability may fade during word
reconstruction because of the intervention of lexical
strategies which leads us to speculate on the importance of
lexical strategies as a consequence of poor functionality of
the MOCB. It would be interesting to test whether lexical
strategies are more important to people with hearing
impairments.
Experiment 3 showed an improvement in speech
reconstruction in sentential context. Electrophysiological
analyses showed both an MMN and an N600. The cortical
generators of the MMN were located in the bilateral
auditory cortices and associated to a frontal (right) generator
that was linked to post-perceptual attentional controls driven
by the MMN itself (Giard, Perrin, Pernier & Bouchet,
1990). During speech comprehension, the MMN could be
considered as a fully automatic response to variation in the
input that may allow attentional controls and on-line
supervision that helps gating the information stream from
perception to comprehension.
The N600 may characterize the implication of elaborated
knowledge during speech restoration. Davis and Johnsrude
(2003) showed that the frontal regions are recruited to help
the restoration or in compensation process.

Conclusion & Perspectives
Speech reconstruction is the result of rapid, efficient
activation of several complex mechanisms. Our experiments
show that the respective involvements of the high and lowlevel mechanisms depend on the nature of the stimuli:
pseudoword stimuli highlight the major role of the MOCB
while word stimuli emphasize lexical strategies. At this
point, we have shown that the amplitude of the N600 wave
is modulated by the duration of the signal degradation.
Further experiments will be necessary to precisely
determine the role of each mechanism, and in the short term
the extension of this experiment to hearing impaired patients
is planned since it could lead to the development of new
hearing aids.
