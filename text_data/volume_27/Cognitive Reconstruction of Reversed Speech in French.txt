Results
We identified two waves characterized by two different
peaks and latencies. In the first time-window we observed a
negative fronto-central wave peaking around 180 ms. This
wave can be categorized as the well-documented MMN

According to the ANOVA including 7 spatial regions and 5

conditions and not for the control (F(4,60)=3.5; p<.05). This
