often introduce the major/minor distinction in terms of
emotional qualities and by the fact that participants with no
musical training spontaneously describe major and minor
musical excerpts in emotional terms (major = happy; minor
= sad) (Hevner, 1935/1937).
Interestingly, the precise musical definitions of the major
and minor modes refer only to the formal properties of these
musical passages (Cayne, 1991). One reason that music
theorists prefer to define modality by these formal qualities
rather than by emotional ones is that the emotional qualities
that characterize opposite modes also characterize opposite
tempi (fast/slow) and pitch (high/low) properties. The effect
of tempo on emotional quality is generally stronger and
more reliable than the effect of modality (Gagnon & Peretz,
2003). Thus, if people rely on emotional valence in learning
the distinction between musical modalities, tempo and pitch
could provide conflicting as well as facilitative cues.
Although emotional qualities do not define the
major/minor distinction as well as formal properties,
attention to emotional qualities may nevertheless enable
explicit category learning if (1) the learner is already
predisposed to think of music in terms of emotional
qualities, (2) the learner already roughly aligns mode with
emotional valence, and (3) the learner has feedback
allowing them to rule out non-modality based sources of
emotional valence. Additionally, sensitivity to emotional
qualities should constrain the learner by (1) limiting the
student’s ability to learn from definitions that do not refer to
emotional valence, (2) leading to errors on problems that pit
tempo- or pitch-produced emotional valence against modeproduced emotional valence, and (3) by conditioning the
transfer of learning such that transfer is highly likely across
problems differing in ways irrelevant to emotional valence,
but not very likely across problems that do differ in
emotional valence.

Abstract
Categorization of musical excerpts was accurately predicted
by subjects’ association of emotional valence with musical
properties. The strength of this association prior to training
predicted greater category knowledge, predicted types of
errors during category learning, and predicted age differences
in learning. Training in this association led to as much
learning as feedback did.
Key words: cognitive development, learning, categorization,
microgenetic study, and music cognition

Introduction
Category learning is often influenced by ‘enabling
constraints’ (Gelman & Williams, 1998). Such constraints
direct children’s attention to relevant features of the learning
task and thereby (1) speed up learning, (2) lead to
predictable errors prior to learning, (3) condition transfer of
learning, and (4) influence differential receptivity to the
types of information that could lead to learning. Although
constrained learning has been observed in several ‘core’
domains that are important to survival, constraints on
learning may be more common than implied by the
core/non-core dichotomy (e.g., Siegler & Crowley, 1994;
Hannon & Trehub, 2005). Category learning in the domain
of music cognition was investigated across two experiments.
We hypothesized that children and adults are biased to
attend to emotional valence when learning to label musical
excerpts by mode and that this hypothesized bias would
generate accurate predictions about the course of learning.

Emotional Valence and Learning
The major/minor distinction was examined for two reasons:
(1) our pilot studies indicated that few musically-untrained
participants knew the explicit major/minor distinction,
thereby allowing examination of how the explicit distinction
is learned and (2) because the major and minor modes are
judged to have different emotional qualities (Hevner,
1935/1937), we expected that emotional qualities would
have a high psychological relevance in learning the
major/minor distinction. The psychological relevance of
emotional valence is indicated by the fact that educators

Hypothesized Development of the Distinction
A useful way to characterize different aspects of the
learning process is suggested by previous work on cognitive
change (Siegler, 1996) which distinguishes between the
variability, source, path, rate, and breadth of change.

2184

Variability An important source of variability in learning
the major/minor distinction may come from individual
differences in how much modality is associated with
emotional qualities. Differences in the strength of this
association have been observed within and across age
groups (Hevner, 1935; Gagnon & Peretz, 2003; Dalla Bella,
Peretz, Rosseau, & Gosselin, 2001; Kastner and Crowder,
1990; Gerardi & Gerken, 1995; Gregory, Worral, & Sarge,
1996). We hypothesized that the strength of the association
between mode and emotional qualities would facilitate
participants’ ability to accurately label excerpts prior to
explicit training.

pretest scores indicated they did not already possess the
major/minor distinction.
Tasks and Materials Participants were given two tasks in
the present study: an emotional valence task and a mode
categorization task. The emotional valence task required
that participants rate the emotional valence of 16 scales and
melodies as warm and sunny (sun icon), cool and cloudy
(cloud icon), or neutral (sun covered by cloud icon) with the
help of an 11-point Likert scale. The mode categorization
task required participants to explicitly label scales and
melodies by mode (see Figure 1). Half of the excerpts in this
study began on notes below middle C and were termed
“low” and half began on notes above middle C and were
termed “high.” The musical excerpts were composed at two
tempi in 4/4 time: fast (110 bpm) and slow (55 bpm).
Experimental trial blocks consisted of 4 musical excerpts
(i.e., 2 major/2 minor; 2 fast/2 slow; 2 high/2 low). The
order of presentation was counterbalanced within each trial
block. Excerpt-type (i.e., scale vs. melody) was held
constant across a trial block.

Source Because very few people without any musical
training can accurately label major and minor excerpts, we
assumed that learning the mode distinction required explicit
instruction. The active ingredients of such instruction, given
subjects’ prior bias to attend to emotional qualities in music,
would most likely include: (1) information associating mode
and emotional valence, and (2) feedback on the correctness
of categorizations.
Path If learning is constrained by emotional valence,
participants would be expected to make particular errors
prior to categorizing by mode. We expected participants’
early attempts to label musical excerpts as major and minor
would involve mapping these labels onto fast and slow
tempi or high and low pitches (respectively).
Rate If attention to emotional valence enables participants
to quickly employ the mode, tempo, and pitch approaches,
subjects would need feedback on their categorization
performance to abandon the tempo and pitch approaches in
favor of the mode approach. If so, accurate labeling of
excerpts would be accomplished most quickly by those
subjects who receive feedback and who are told that major
excerpts have a positive emotional quality and that minor
excerpts have a negative emotional quality.

Figure 1: Stimuli examples.

Design and Procedure
The present experiment was composed of an emotional
valence rating phase, pretest phase, training phase, and
posttest/generalization phase. The overall design of the
current experiment was a 2 (mode: major/minor) x 2
(tempo: fast/slow) x 2 (pitch: high/low) x 2 (excerpt-type:
scale/melody) x 2 (feedback: yes/no) x 2 (definition-type:
Formal + Emotional Valence/Formal + Filler) mixed
factorial design with feedback and definition-type as
between-subjects variables.

Breadth It was assumed that scales and melodies would not
differ in their emotional qualities. If this assumption holds,
then participants should transfer learning from scale
excerpts to melody excerpts.

Emotional Valence Rating Phase Participants rated the
emotional valence of 16 musical excerpts with the help of
an 11-point Likert emotional valence rating scale.

Experiment 1
The purpose of Experiment 1 was to test hypotheses about
adults’ ability to learn the major/minor distinction. Adults
listened to musical excerpts that varied in tempo, pitch, and
mode, and they were instructed to categorize the excerpts on
the basis of mode. Two types of instruction were provided
to participants in a factorial design: definitions that
referenced either the formal structure or emotional quality
of scales and corrective feedback.

Pretest Phase Participants listened to eight major excerpts
(4 scales/4 melodies) and eight minor excerpts (4 scales/4
melodies) and were asked to appropriately label the excerpts
by mode without feedback from the researcher. If
participants correctly categorized more than 75% of
excerpts at pretest, they were excluded from the remainder
of the experimental phases since it was assumed that they
already knew the major/minor distinction.

Method
Participants Sixty-four adults (mean age = 20.25)
participated in all phases of the experiment because their

Training Phase Participants listened to 32 musical scale
excerpts and were subsequently asked to categorize these

excerpts on the basis of mode. Training differed by
experimental condition. There were four experimental
conditions in the training phase of the current study: (1)
Feedback/Emotional
Valence
(F/EV),
(2)
No
Feedback/Emotional Valence (NF/EV), (3) Feedback/Filler
(F/Fill), and (4) No Feedback/Filler (NF/Fill).
All participants were given the formal, dictionary
definitions for major/minor scales. Each participant was told
“Half-steps appear in the major scale between the 3rd and
4th notes and the 7th and 8th notes. The distance between
all other consecutive notes is 2 half-steps, and half-steps
appear in the minor scale between the 2nd and 3rd notes, the
5th and 6th notes, and the 7th and 8th notes. The distance
between all other consecutive notes is 2 half-steps. The
exception is that there are 3 half-steps between the 6th and
7th notes.” Half of the participants were also given
Emotional Valence definitions (“Major musical scales are
happy and cheerful, and minor musical scales are sad and
gloomy.”), whereas the other half was given Filler
definitions (“Major musical scales are diatonic in structure,
and minor musical scales are harmonic, melodic, or
natural.”). Additionally, half of the participants were given
feedback, whereas the other half was not given feedback.

training group (50% to 60%). There was a trend towards a
main effect of feedback, (Feed, M = .26, No Feed, M = .09),
F(1, 63) = 3.83, p < .10. There was also a main effect of
definitions (Formal + EV, M = .27, Formal + Filler, M =
.08), F(1, 63) = 5.28, p < .05.
Path Categorization accuracy was influenced by the
perceived emotional qualities of the musical excerpts: fast
excerpts were often labeled “major,” whereas slow excerpts
were often labeled “minor.” Interestingly, this trend was
magnified during the training and posttest phases,
presumably because participants who were provided with
definitions referencing emotional valence ignored feedback
except where it fit their pre-conceived association between
emotional valence and modality (Figure 2).

Results and Discussion

To examine the various categorization approaches
(“mode”: correct; “tempo”: major = fast/minor = slow;
“pitch”: major = high/minor = low; “other”: all major, all
minor, opposite) that participants used more directly, a
backward-trials graphing procedure was used to illustrate
the path of change during the training phase (Siegler, 1996).
The 0 trial block refers to participants’ first correct
categorization by mode; thus, by definition, performance on
this trial block was 100% correct. The -1 trial block refers to
performance on the trial block immediately before the 0 trial
block; trial block +1 refers to performance on the trial block
immediately after the 0 trial block.
As predicted, the most common error prior to first use of
the mode approach was categorization based on tempo. On
Trial Block -1, 48% of adults categorized on the basis of
tempo at above chance levels (Chance: mode = 31%, tempo
= 13%, pitch = 13%, other = 44%) (Figure 3).

Variability We hypothesized that “experts,” participants
who correctly categorized more than 75% of musical
excerpts on pretest, would also most strongly associate
emotional qualities with mode. We measured the strength of
this association for each subject by taking the absolute value
of the difference in emotional valence rating for the major
and minor excerpts divided by the total span of the Likert
scale (EV Span for modality). The EV Span for modality
had a possible range of 0% to 100%. Expert adults had
higher EV Spans than did non-expert adults (experts, M =
42%, non-experts, M = 20%), F(1, 82) = 25.0, p < .001.
Adults who learned the major/minor distinction (i.e., correct
categorization of at least 75% of scales after training) had
higher EV Spans for modality than did those adults who did
not learn the distinction (i.e., correct categorization of less
than 75% of scales after training) (learners, M = 28%, nonlearners, M = 18%), F(1, 63) = 4.57, p < .05.
Source We next examined whether adults’ categorizations
of modality were affected by the particular experiences they
received during the feedback phase. We performed a
training group (F/EV, NF/EV, F/Fill, NF/Fill) X test phase
(pretest and posttest) ANOVA on percent correct
categorizations. The percentage of correct categorizations
increased from pretest to posttest, F(1, 127) = 13.68, p <
.01. Paired t-tests revealed pretest to posttest differences in
the F/EV training group (53% to 72%) and in the F/Fill

Rate To examine whether different types of training
produced different rates of learning, we performed a training
condition (F/EV, NF/EV, F/Fill, NF/Fill) X test phase
(pretest, training trial blocks 1-8, posttest) ANOVA on
percent correct categorizations. Although there was a main
effect of condition and test phase, training group and test
phase did not interact, indicating that rates of learning were
comparable across training groups.

Training Phase Participants were not provided with the
formal, dictionary definitions for major/minor scales. Our
pilot studies indicated that formal definitions did not
facilitate categorization of musical excerpts by mode, and it
was hypothesized that the formal definitions would
confuse/distract the children participants.

Breadth Although participants were trained only on scales,
they generalized learning to novel melodies presented after
the training phase. Participants were just as successful at
categorizing scales as melodies across experimental phases,
possibly due to the fact that the EV Spans for modality did
not differ based on excerpt-type.

Variability Prior to training adult “experts” most strongly
associated emotional qualities with modality (experts, M =
42%, non-experts, M = 30%), F(1, 92) = 7.61, p < .01.
There were too few ten-year-old and five-year-old experts to
have the statistical power to generate meaningful tests of our
hypothesis. Adults who learned the major/minor distinction
showed a tendency to have higher EV Spans for modality
than did those adults who did not learn the distinction
(learners, M = 34%, non-learners, M = 24%), F(1, 63) =
3.30, p < .10. Ten-year-olds who learned the major/minor
distinction had higher EV Spans for modality than did those
ten-year-olds who did not learn the distinction, (learners, M
= 38%, non-learners, M = 23%), F(1, 63) = 7.70, p < .01.
There was a main effect of age on EV Span for modality, F
(2, 218) = 7.32, p < .001. Post-hoc tests indicated that 5year-olds associated emotional valence with modality less
than adults, t (144) = 3.88, p < .001 and 10-year-olds, t
(124) = 2.24, p < .05.

Results and Discussion

Experiment 2
The purpose of Experiment 2 was to test hypotheses about
adults’, ten-year-old children’s, and five-year-old children’s
ability to learn the major/minor distinction. It was
hypothesized that if children failed to associate the
emotional valence of major/minor excerpts with mode,
learning of the major/minor distinction would not be
facilitated. Participants listened to musical excerpts that
varied in pitch and mode, they were instructed to categorize
the excerpts on the basis of mode, and tempo was varied
across participants rather than within participants.

Method
Participants Sixty-four adults (mean age = 19.32), 64 10year-olds (mean age = 10.25), and 48 5-year-olds (mean age
= 5.7) participated in all phases of the experiment because
their pretest scores indicated they did not already possess
the major/minor distinction.
Tasks and Materials All tasks and materials used in the
current experiment were the same as those used in
Experiment 1 except where differences are indicated.
Tempo was made a between-subjects variable. Experimental
trial blocks consisted of 4 musical excerpts (i.e., 2 major/2
minor; 2 high/2 low).

Design and Procedure
The design and procedure used in the current experiment
was the same as used in Experiment 1 except where
differences are indicated. The overall design for the current
experiment was a 2 (mode: major/minor) x 2 (tempo:
fast/slow) x 2 (pitch: high/low) x 2 (excerpt-type:
scale/melody) x 2 (feedback: yes/no) x 2 (definition-type:
Emotional Valence/Filler) mixed factorial design with
tempo, feedback, and definition-type as between-subjects
variables.

Source Similar to Experiment 1, we examined whether
categorizations of modality were affected by the particular
experiences subjects received during the feedback phase.
For adults, the percentage of correct categorizations
increased from pretest to posttest, F(1, 127) = 20.52, p <
.001. Paired t-tests revealed pretest to posttest improvements
in the F/EV training group (54% to 87%), in the NF/EV
group (51% to 74%), and in the F/Fill training group (59%
to 72%), p’s < .01. For 10-year-olds, there was a tendency
for improvement in the F/EV group (56% to 69%, p < .10).
There was a main effect of feedback for adults, (Feed, M =
.51, No Feed, M = .02), F(1, 63) = 12.76, p < .001 and
nearly a main effect for 10-year-olds (Feed, M = .12, No
Feed, M = -.21), F(1, 63) = 3.6, p < .10. There was a main
effect of definitions for adults (EV, M = .56, Fill, M = -.03),
F(1, 63) = 9.54, p < .001, and 10-year-olds (EV, M = .17,
Fill, M = -.26), F(1, 63) = 5.78, p < .01. There was nearly a
significant interaction between feedback and definition type
for adults (F/EV, M = .67, NF/EV, M = .45, F/Fill, M = .35,
NF/Fill, M = -.41), F(1, 63) = 3.96, p < .10.
Path Errors for all age groups on pretest were not well
predicted by emotional valence. However, adults’
categorizations reached higher levels of accuracy during the
training and posttest phases than in Experiment 1 (Figure 4).

Rate Similar to Experiment 1, we examined whether
different types of training produced different rates of

F(15, 383) = 3.62, p < .001.

General Discussion

As predicted, the most common error prior to first use of
the mode approach was categorization based on pitch (see
Figures 5, 6, and 7). On Trial Block -1, 57% of adults, 47%
of 10-year-olds, and 48% of 5-year-olds categorized on the
basis of pitch at above chance levels (Chance: mode = 31%,
pitch = 13%, other = 56%). Age differences were greatest
not in initial approaches but in continued use of the correct
approach that had been rewarded with positive feedback.

Similar to learning in ‘core’ domains, learning of the
major/minor distinction was constrained by domain-relevant
properties, specifically by the emotional qualities that
characterize major versus minor musical excerpts.

Evidence for Enabling Constraints
Variability The general hypothesis that attention to the
emotional valence of musical excerpts facilitates learning of
the major/minor distinction led to predictions about the
relation between prior knowledge and learning. We had
specifically hypothesized that an important source of
individual differences in knowledge of the major/minor
distinction would be the extent to which subjects associated
mode with emotional valence. Support for this hypothesis
was found in both experiments with expert adults, where
participants who could accurately label the modality of
musical excerpts prior to training were most likely to rate
major and minor passages as differing greatly in emotional
qualities. Learners across the experiments also tended to or
did have significantly higher EV Spans for modality than
did non-learners indicating that those participants who most
strongly associated modality with emotional qualities also
tended to correctly categorize more excerpts by the mode
approach after receiving feedback.

Source If attention to the emotional valence of musical
excerpts facilitates learning of the major/minor distinction,
two important sources of learning should be: (1) information
associating modality and emotional valence and (2)
corrective feedback. Adult and ten-year-old participants
who received both feedback and emotional valence
definitions during the training phase generally showed the
most improvement from pretest to posttest. Feedback and
definitions seemed to contribute to correct categorizations in
an additive manner.

musical features that share the emotional valence of major
and minor excerpts. During pretest and training (but prior to
the first use of the mode approach) in Experiment 1, adults
labeled fast excerpts as major and slow excerpts as minor. In
Experiment 2, where tempo was varied between rather than
within subjects, adults reported relatively small differences
in emotional valence across excerpts differing in tempo, but
reported the greatest differences in emotional valence for
high versus low excerpts and major versus minor excerpts.
Similarly, before first use of the mode approach, the most
common approach used by 5-year-olds through adults was
to label high excerpts as major and low excerpts as minor.

heroes are in the major mode). Thus, while the association
between emotional valence and modality was found
important for learning to label major and minor excerpts
accurately and found to influence the course of learning,
there are also reasonable grounds to suspect that the
association is acquired from cultural learning.

Rate The hypothesis that attention to emotional valence
enables participants to quickly employ the mode, tempo,
and pitch approaches also generated predictions about the
conditions under which learning would be fastest. It was
predicted that subjects would need feedback on their
categorization performance to abandon the tempo and pitch
approaches in favor of the mode approach. In Experiment 1,
the difference between adults’ pretest and posttest
performance was greatest for the training condition where
change was expected to be greatest (F/EV); however, the
trial-to-trial differences during the training phase did not
reliably differ across training conditions. In Experiment 2,
adult performance was accurately predicted by our
hypotheses: adults in the F/EV training group showed the
greatest trial-to-trial gains.
Breadth Scales and melodies were experimentally equated
such that differences in emotional valence were neither
predicted nor found. It was anticipated that learning that
occurred from training on scales would generalize to novel
melodies. Results were strongly consistent with this
hypothesis: across both experiments, participants were just
as successful at categorizing melodies as they were at
categorizing scales.

Category

Presumably, few people would argue that music is an
evolutionarily privileged domain: the domain of music
offers little if any survival benefits to its listeners (Pinker,
1997). The constraints on music learning may be similar to
constraints found in other non-privileged domains (e.g., tictac-toe and arithmetic strategies, Siegler & Crowley (1994)).
In this view, the link associating the emotion of happiness
with major musical excerpts and the emotion of sadness
with minor musical excerpts is not innate and has not been
subjected to natural selection. Two of the findings from our
present experiments support this conclusion: (1) some
(though not many) adults failed to report different emotional
valences for major and minor excerpts and (2) the difference
in the emotional ratings of major and minor excerpts
increased greatly with age and experience. In addition, there
are many possible sources for this association that may be
found in the broader culture (e.g., movies in which the
leitmotifs of villains are in the minor mode and those of
