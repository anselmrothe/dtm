     Sensorial Epistemic Actions and Eliciting
                      Epistemic Actions
Theoretical Analysis
Kirsh and Maglio (1994) make a fundamental distinction
between two kinds of action: pragmatic actions and epis-
temic actions. According to their analysis, pragmatic actions
are “actions performed to bring one physically closer to a
goal” (Kirsh & Maglio, 1994, p. 513), whereas epistemic
actions are “actions performed to uncover information that
is hidden or hard to compute mentally” (p. 513). In other
words, pragmatic actions are actions by means of which an
agent changes the world in order to create a state of affairs
that brings it physically closer to the goal that it wants to
reach. Epistemic actions, instead, are actions by means of                Figure 1: Illustrating scheme for sensorial epistemic action.
