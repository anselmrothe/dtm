Abstract
This study examined the effect of age and language structure
on working memory (WM) performance in three groups of
participants (7;0-8;6 9;6-11:00; 19-22 years). The findings
suggest that both age and language structure have an impact
on WM performance. There was an interaction between these
two factors that resulted in differences in performance pattern
and error type. The measures of the storage function were
influenced by the length of the stimuli, whereas processing
efficiency was affected by sentence complexity.

Working memory (WM) and executive
functions
There is a strong relationship between WM and executive
functions across age groups and populations. WM span
measures predict language comprehension (Engle & Kane,
2004). In recent years, significant individual and
developmental differences have been explored in WM
performance. These findings resulted in a conceptual debate
regarding resource sharing. A variety of unitary and semiunitary models (e.g., Conway & Engle, 1996; Cowan, 1997,
Just & Carpenter, 1992) have been developed that
challenged Baddeley's multicomponent theory (Baddeley,
1986). WM capacity tasks became closely tied to measures
of attention control in contexts that involve distraction or
interference (Feldman Barrett, Tugade, & Engle, 2004).
A number of researchers have found a close relationship
between individual differences in WM capacity and general
executive functions (e.g., Conway & Engle, 1994; Engle &
Cane, 2004). WM span was constrained by controlled
attention (Engle, Kane, & Tuholski, 1999), by task
switching ability (Towse, Hitch, & Hutton, 1998), and by
the inhibition of irrelevant information (Hasher & Zacks,
1988). According to Baddeley's model, participants may
demonstrate individual variations in processing and storage
1413

independently from a general executive capacity in complex
WM span tasks (Bayliss, Jarrold, Gunn, & Baddeley, 2003).
The extent to which performance on complex WM span
tasks depends on processing and storage functions is still
subject to debate (see more detailed conceptual reviews of
WM e.g., Baddeley, 2000; Engle & Kane, 2004; Miyake &
Shah, 1999).
Developmental studies on WM performance evidenced
that executive functions develop gradually until adolescence
(DeLuca, Wood, Anderson, Bucanan, Proffitt, Mahony, &
Pantelis, 2003). WM span development reflects a
combination of various factors, such as the efficiency and
speed of processing. Older children perform faster on the
same tasks as younger children therefore, they need fewer
resources to perform the required activity (e.g., counting)
and have more resources available for memory operations
(Case, Kurland, & Goldberg, 1982). A different
interpretation of age-related changes is provided by the taskswitching model (Towse & Hitsch, 1995). In linguistic span
tasks, participants may use the sentence context to help
reconstruct the list of words that have to be remembered. If
this reconstitution process is difficult, it may take so much
time that some information could be lost. Younger children
may make more errors because of difficulty in attention
switching. In complex WM tasks, span measures may
reflect the ability to control/switch attention, whereas
response times depend on retrieval speed (Hitsch, Towse, &
Hutton, 2001; Kail & Salthouse, 1994). Barrouillet &
Camos (2001) suggest that increases in attentional capacity
and better attention switching result in developmental
increases in WM span.
The present study examined whether developmental
differences in WM support the theory of WM capacity and
executive attention (Engle & Kane, 2004). According to this
theory, individual differences in WM capacity are not about
memory storage per se, but reflect executive control, the
ability to maintain goal-relevant information in a context of
interference. Therefore, WM measures reflect multiple

All children in Groups 1-2 were typically developing
based on interviews with parents and teachers. Every
participant passed a language screening (CELF-3 Screening
test; Semel, Wiig, & Secord, 1995), a hearing test, and a
basic measure of single nonword repetition and nonword
discrimination. The primary language of each participant
was English. Nonword repetition and nonword
discrimination tasks were used to obtain a baseline measure
of participants' WM storage function and general
discrimination abilities.

constructs and indicate not only the individual's short-term
storage capacity, but also their ability to switch attention
during processing of task stimuli.
In the current study, this theory was tested with 2
listening span tasks in which the stimuli varied in both
length and linguistic complexity. Verbal WM performance
in English-speaking adults is influenced by the syntactic
complexity of the sentences (King & Just, 1991). Sentences
with more complex syntactic structures are more difficult to
comprehend than simple sentences because they require
more processing resources and attentional capacity. For
example, interpolated material may decrease the quality of
memory representations. Processing accuracy decreased as
sentence complexity increased because of the changing
amount of interpolated material (McElree, Foraker, & Dyer,
2003).
The effect of sentence length versus complexity was
tested in 3 age-groups in the present study. The following
research questions were examined: 1. Are various
performance measures differently sensitive to changes in
age and language structure? We explored whether the
manipulation of the independent variables (age, sentence
length, word length, sentence complexity) results in
performance accuracy differences. 2. Does sentence
complexity or length have a larger impact on children's WM
performance in linguistic span tasks? Although there is
evidence in the adult literature that syntactically complex
structures have a large impact on WM performance, most
developmental studies used short and/or simple sentences in
linguistic span tasks with children (e.g., Cain, Oakhill, &
Bryant, 2004; Gathercole, Pickering, Ambridge, & Wearing,
2004). 3. Is there an interaction in WM performance
between age and language structure? Specifically, we
examined the interaction between age and sentence
complexity. Based on the theory of WM capacity and
executive attention (Engle & Kane, 2004), we hypothesized
that age-related differences in executive functions are
reflected in the accuracy of processing complex linguistic
structures because the efficiency of sentence processing is
highly related to the demands that sentence structure
variations place on memory resources (McElree et al.,
2003).

Participants
Three groups of children and young adults participated in
this experiment (n=75). There were 25 participants in each
group; the groups differed in age (7;0-8;6 years; 9;6-11:00
years; college students, 19-22 years; see Table 1). The
rationale for choosing these age groups was based on
previous findings that indicated immature executive
functions, such as the maintenance of task goals, sustained
attention, set shifting, and inhibition below 8-8;6 years of
age. Although memory span improves between age 10 and
adulthood, resistance to interference matures around 10
years of age (DeLuca, Wood, Anderson, Buchanan, Proffitt,
Mahony, & Pantelis, 2003; Hale, Bronik, & Fry, 1997).

To measure the relations between WM and language
comprehension, we developed a Modified Listening Span
task (ML). The task included 90 sentences (30 syntactically
simple short sentences, 30 syntactically complex short
sentences, and 30 syntactically complex long sentences)
with a question for each sentence. Sentence-length was
determined by the number of syllables (M = 7.91, SD = 1.64
for the short sentences; M = 17.64, SD = 3.47 for the long
sentences). The complex sentences included relative
clauses. The last word in each sentence was replaced with a
nonword (2-, 3-, 4-syllable). The nonwords were part of the
syntactic structure of the sentences. The task required that
participants listen to a sentence, repeat the sentence-final
nonword and answer a question about the content of the
sentence. (See further details in Marton & Schwartz, 2003).
This task required simultaneous processing and attention
switching.
The second linguistic span task consisted of 9 sets of
sentences with 5 sentences in each set (3 sets with
syntactically simple short sentences, 3 sets with
syntactically complex short sentences, and 3 sets with
syntactically complex long sentences). Participants were
asked to listen to the sentences and repeat the 5 sentencefinal words in the order of presentation. The words were real
words with similar phonotactic patterns, syllable length, and
frequency of occurrence. Following sentence presentation,
yes/no questions were randomly asked.

Results
Nonword repetition and nonword discrimination tasks
were used to have a baseline measure of participants' WM
storage function. There was a group effect (F (2, 148) =
16.13, p < 0.001) and a word length effect (F (2, 148) =
39.5, p < 0.001) for nonword repetition. There was no

interaction between group and number of syllables; each
group showed a clear word-length effect as the number of
syllables increased. In nonword discrimination, there was a
main effect for group (F (2, 72) = 12.92, p < 0.001).
However, each group showed a high performance level in
this task.
Factorial ANOVAs were used to examine the differences
between and within groups for the complex linguistic span
tasks. For the ML task, two different dependent variables
(answers to the questions and nonword repetition) were
analyzed with two separate ANOVAs: correct answers to
the questions with group x sentence type as independent
variables and nonword repetition accuracy with a group x
sentence type x word length design. These analyses were
performed to test the effects of age and stimulus length
versus complexity on WM performance accuracy. The
answers to the questions were expected to reflect processing
capacity and executive functions, whereas nonword
repetition was a measure of short-term storage. Effect sizes
(d) were calculated and categorized as small effect size: d =
0.2, medium effect size: d = 0.5, large effect size: d = 0.8 for
the group differences (Cohen, 1988).
The overall results for the answers to the questions
showed a main effect for both group (F (1, 148) = 46.88, p <
0.001, d = 1.11 for Group 1-2; d = 1.8 for Group 1-3; d =
0.81 for Group 2-3) and sentence type (F (2, 148) = 11.23,
p<0.001). There was no interaction between the 2 variables
(F (2, 148) = 0.4, p = 0.67). The older groups answered
more questions correctly than the younger ones with each
sentence type. Pair-wise comparisons reflected significant
differences in response accuracy between the simple /S/ and
complex sentences: (F (1, 148) = 17.99, p < 0.001, for the
complex short sentences /CS/, (F (1, 148) = 9.82, p < 0.01,
for the complex long sentences /CL/). There was no
difference in performance accuracy between the CS and CL
sentences (F (1, 148) = 0.99, p = 0.32). Participants in each
group gave more correct answers following the simple
sentences than the complex sentences. Performance
accuracy decreased with an increase in sentence complexity
regardless of sentence length (see table 2). Thus, sentence
complexity had a larger effect on performance accuracy in
this task than the length of the sentences.
In addition to the quantitative differences that we
observed with an increase in age, the groups also showed
different error patterns in their answers. The two most
common error categories were omissions and interference.
Participants either forgot the relevant information or they
gave an answer that was related to one of the previous
questions. A comparison across groups showed an
interaction between group and error type (F (2, 148) = 4.43,
p < 0.05) and between sentence type and error type (F (2,
148) = 19.43, p < 0.001). Post hoc Tuckey tests (p < 0.05)
showed that children in Group 1 made significantly more
interference errors than omissions with each sentence type,
whereas Group 2 and 3 made more omissions than
interference errors with the simple sentences, however, the
number of interference errors increased with the complex

sentences. The number of omissions did not differ across
sentence types. Sentence complexity had a large effect on
the number of interference errors; participants made
significantly more interference errors with the complex
sentences than with the simple ones. Interference errors
reflect executive functions: either difficulty with
suppressing previously relevant information or switching
attention as the task requirements change. The group
differences in error patterns seem to be related to the
development of executive functions.

The second dependent measure for the ML task was
nonword repetition. The results showed a significant main
effect for group (F (2, 148) = 78.32, p < 0.001, d = 0.62 for
Group 1-2; d = 1.16 for Group 1-3; d = 0.37 for Group 2-3)
and syllable length (F (2, 148) = 104.81, p < 0.001, but not
for sentence type (F (2, 148) = 0.69, p = 0.5). There was
also a group x syllable length interaction (F (4, 148) = 4.6, p
< 0.01). Post hoc Tukey tests (p < 0.05) showed that Group
1 differed from Groups 2 and 3 at each syllable length,
whereas Groups 2 and 3 differed from each other only on
the 3- and 4-syllable nonwords (see table 3). The within
group results showed that repetition accuracy for 2- and 3syllable nonwords did not differ in any of the groups. Thus,
nonword repetition accuracy, the measure of storage rather
than processing, was influenced by the length of the words,
but not by the complexity of the sentence.

In the traditional listening span task, participants' WM
performance was examined with two different scoring
methods: with the free scoring method, participants received
credit for each word, regardless of the order of recall. The
results of a factorial ANOVA showed a main effect for
group (F (2, 148) = 101.67, p < 0.001, d = 1.33 for Group 12; d = 2.27 for Group 1-3; d = 0.9 for Group 2-3) and
sentence type (F (2, 148) = 5.78, p < 0.01). There was no
group x sentence type interaction (F (4, 148) = 0.16, p =
0.96). Participants in each group recalled more words
following the simple than the complex sentences. Sentence
length did not influence performance accuracy, similar to
participants' performance on the answers to the questions in
the ML task (see Table 4).
The second scoring method involved the order of
presentation. Participants only received credit if the words
were recalled in the order of presentation. The results of a
factorial ANOVA showed a main effect for group (F (2,
148) = 88.21, p < 0.001, d = 1.13 for Group 1-2; d = 2.27
for Group 1-3; d = 1 for Group 2-3) and for sentence type (F
(2, 148) = 4.3, p < 0.05). There was no group x sentence
type interaction (F (4, 148) = 0.71, p = 0.59). The effect of
sentence type on recall was similar with both scoring
methods. The increase in sentence complexity resulted in a
decrease in recall accuracy. The length of the complex
sentences did not influence performance accuracy.
Variations in sentence structure complexity were more
demanding on executive functions, such as attention
switching, than the variations in the length of the sentences.

0.72 for the simple sentences; F (1, 48) = 1.6, p = 0.21 for
the complex sentences).
As mentioned above, participants showed different
performance patterns on the ML task for recall accuracy and
for error type on the two dependent measures (nonword
repetition & answers to the questions). The answers to the
questions were highly influenced by sentence complexity,
whereas nonword repetition with sentence context was not.
The latter variable showed an effect of word length. These
results indicate that the accuracy of question answers
reflects processing and executive functions rather than
storage, whereas nonword repetition accuracy reflects
storage rather than executive functions. We further
examined this question with a correlation analysis. A high
correlation was found between single nonword repetition
and nonword repetition with a sentence context (r (75) =
0.62, p < 0.001). There was also a high correlation between
the answers to the questions in the ML task and the LS task
(r (75) = 0.59, p < 0.001).

Further, there was a difference in recall accuracy for the
groups when we compared the results with the two scoring
methods. The scores significantly decreased for Group 1
when we considered the order of recall with both the simple
(F (1, 48) = 9.01, p < 0.01) and the complex sentences (F (1,
48) = 6.07, p < 0.05). The scores for Group 2 only dropped
with the complex sentences (F (1, 48) = 7.37, p < 0.01)
across the two scoring methods. There was no difference in
scores for the simple sentences between the free and the
order scoring (F (1, 48) = 2.24, p = 0.14). Finally, Group 3
did not show any significant differences in their scores with
the two methods for any sentence type (F (1, 48) = 3.38, p =

Discussion
The current study examined the effects of age and
sentence complexity on WM performance. Previous studies
that have examined age-related changes in WM structures
used short and/or simple sentences in linguistic span tasks
(Cain, et al., 2004; Gathercole, et al., 2004). Although the
findings with adults showed an effect of linguistic
complexity on WM performance in complex span tasks, to
our knowledge, no previous research has examined the
relations between linguistic complexity and age in children's
WM performance. The current study extended previous
work by exploring the effect of sentence length and
complexity on WM performance in groups of participants
that differed in age. We examined whether stimulus length
or complexity has a larger effect on WM performance
accuracy and language comprehension, and whether this
relationship changes with age during childhood and
adolescence. Further, this study tested the theory of WM
capacity and executive attention (Engle & Kane, 2004) from
a developmental perspective.
The results in each WM task showed an age effect;
younger children made more errors than the older
participants. Performance accuracy also differed between
Groups 2 and 3, particularly with more complex items.
Age-related changes were further observed in different error
types and performance patterns, especially with an increase
in stimulus complexity.
In addition to an age effect, the results of the linguistic
span tasks showed an effect of sentence complexity on WM
performance. Participants in each group showed higher WM
performance accuracy following the simple sentences than
the complex sentences. Sentence length differences did not
impact performance accuracy in the current study. This
latter finding is similar to Willis & Gathercole (2001); the
increased length of stimulus items does not affect sentence
comprehension.
However, syntactic complexity does
matter. The two dependent measures of the ML task
reflected the contribution of storage and processing
efficiency separately. Sentence complexity affected the

answers to the questions, but not nonword repetition.
Nonword repetition accuracy was influenced by word
length, but not by syntactic complexity. The idea of separate
contributions of storage and processing efficiency in the ML
task was further supported by the high correlation between
nonword repetition in the ML task and single nonword
repetition, and by the high correlation between the answers
to the questions in the ML task and the LS task. These
findings are similar to those of Bayliss and colleagues
(2003), who suggested that processing efficiency and
storage capacity constrain complex span performance
independently.
The results of the linguistic span tasks (ML, LS) of the
current study are also in agreement with the findings of
Gathercole, Pickering, Ambridge, and Wearing (2004), and
suggest that an increase in age results in the improvement of
executive functions. Executive functions are used to
integrate phonological, lexical, syntactic, and semantic
representations in sentence span tasks. Younger children
seem to rely more on storage resources and show more
difficulty in attention switching and flexible adaptation to
changing task requirements. In this study, this was
evidenced not only by their lower scores, but also by the
age-related differences in performance pattern. In contrast to
the performance of the older participants, younger children
produced more interference errors than omissions with each
sentence type. They showed more difficulty in blocking the
effects of prior sentence information. The children in Group
2 produced more interference errors only with increased
sentence complexity. Most of their errors with the simple
sentences were omissions. Performance accuracy in young
adults (Group 3) was also influenced by sentence
complexity, but they made significantly fewer interference
errors than the children in Groups 1 and 2, even with the
complex sentences. Young adults showed better monitoring
of previously recalled items. McCormack, Brown, &
Vousden (2000) also found a decrease in interference errors
with age in short-term memory tasks.
A similar age-related pattern emerged when performance
on the listening span task was compared using two scoring
methods: free recall versus recall with order. There was no
significant difference between the scores for the participants
in Group 3; children in Group 2 received similar scores with
the two methods for the simple sentences, but not for the
complex sentences. Their scores with the free recall scoring
method were higher than with the order scoring for the
complex sentences. The youngest children showed score
differences with each sentence type, even with the simple
sentences. The finding that children in Group 1 received
higher scores with the free scoring method following each
sentence type shows that they were able to remember the
words but not the order of presentation. This finding also
supports the idea that they may rely more on storage
resources than on general processing. Remembering both
the items and their order of presentation requires the ability
to maintain goal-relevant information and continuous
attention switching. Further research is needed to decide
whether the high number of interference errors in young

children reflect poor inhibition, difficulty in suppressing
irrelevant information, or a weakness in mental flexibility
and attention switching.
Although processing efficiency was influenced by
sentence complexity, but not length, nonword repetition
performance -that reflects the storage function rather than
processing- showed a word-length effect. Performance on
both tasks, single nonword repetition and nonword
repetition with sentence context, decreased with the increase
of syllable length. In the ML task, there was also an
interaction between word length and age. The younger
children performed more poorly than the older participants
at each syllable length; performance accuracy between
Groups 2 and 3 did not differ with the 2-syllable nonwords,
only with the longer nonwords. WM span continuous to
improve between 10-11 years of age and adulthood.
Taken these results together with the findings on the
linguistic span measures, the two functions of WM, storage
and processing efficiency were differently affected by the
structure and complexity of the stimuli. Nonword repetition,
the measure of the storage function, was influenced by
stimulus length, but not by the sentence type, whereas the
answers to the questions and listening span, that reflect
processing efficiency, were affected by sentence
complexity, but not sentence length.
The results of the two listening span tasks support the
theory of WM capacity and executive attention (Engle &
Kane, 2004). Performance accuracy increased and the
proportion of interference errors decreased with age. These
age-related differences reflect better attention switching and
executive control. Participants needed to switch attention
continuously during the processing of complex linguistic
structures in the listening span tasks. There was a gradual
development in performance accuracy across groups: the
listening span tasks were most demanding on WM for the
youngest children, who performed more poorly than groups
2-3 with each sentence type. Group 2 differed from Group 3
only with the complex sentences. The development of
executive functions and their effect on WM performance
were also reflected in children's errors. Younger children
showed more difficulty in blocking previously presented
information, which problem resulted in a high number of
interference errors. Monitoring previously recalled items
requires executive functions that develop with age.
In conclusion, both age and language structure have an
impact on WM performance. There is an interaction
between these two factors that has an additional influence
on individual performance variations in WM tasks. The
findings indicate that different WM tasks do not involve the
same processes and that both factors, language and age, may
influence them differently.
