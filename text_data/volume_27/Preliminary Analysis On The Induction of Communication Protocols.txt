     A person'  s beliefs and desires thus her intention is a two
way relationship with her: (i) inner processes and (ii) the
activity that she is engaged in. They are always mutually
conceptualizing the context of her action. Therefore, the
choice of intention is more likely to be activity directed
depending on the task that the person has to do. In some cases
the activity direction can turn some task, into short term-goals
or long-term goals (i.e. persistent goal). We give a scenario
below to illustrate why we model the intentions as activity-
directed:
     I think I want to do C -(1) I am going to do C -(2)
   I will do C -(3) I am doing C -(4) I have done C -(5)
As an example, these are representations of some mental
states of a person’s activity that have been manipulated
during time. What manipulates the “states” has direct
relationship to the activity states implying what the person is
actively conceptualizing. What happens when there is an
impeachment to do C during step (3)?
    C can' t be done -(6) I think I can'    t do C -(7) I think
 maybe I won'    t do C -(8) I think I really won'   t do C -(9) I              Figure 3: Daily chats between Mathew and Pete.
         won' t do C- (10) C won'     t be done by me -(11)
  For this, we argue that not all communication is goal-
directed. The way one communicates normally reflects her
ongoing activities. These activities may influence the states of
beliefs and/or desires and thus her intention. As a
consequence, the current activity she is engaged in might
make her to change directions during the course of
communication. The next question is, how do we study these
“interruptions” of states? We relate this to the transactional
dynamics approach. Transactional dynamics is centered on
the idea that treats “events” as the fundamentals unit of study.
Events here are defined as a composition of psychological,
temporal and environmental aspects. Although we relate our
study to this approach, we do not use this term in our
framework for the reason that we look at the different phases             Figure 4: A typical virtual meeting, held at least once in two

and at that point, what changes had occurred (i.e. interruption
or pause). Therefore we replace the term “transactional
