                      Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is a useful tool in cognitive modelling,
allowing the designer to examine if the model is consistent
with its underlying theory and to test the robustness of the
model in a variety of operational contexts. PAM uses three
key parameters in modelling plausibility judgements,
inviting the criticism that that they are all not really required
to achieve predictive accuracy. If one or more of the
variables (number of paths P, mean path length L,
proportion of hypothetical paths H) is not making a
significant contribution to PAM’s performance, then a much
more parsimonious model may exist for computing
plausibility. This state of affairs could, in turn, have
complexity implications for any use of the model for other,
related tasks.
   Furthermore, as Cooper at al. (1996) have argued, it is
important that the key parameters of the model are those
motivated by the theory and not those motivated simply by
the need to make the model work (i.e., the so-called the A|B
distinction for cognitive models). For these reasons, we
performed a sensitivity analysis in which we systematically
vary the contribution of each variable to the plausibility                        Figure 3: Three-dimensional illustration of PAM’s
