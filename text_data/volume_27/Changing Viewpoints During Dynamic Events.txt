can be transferred into another or connected to another
camera viewpoint by a “filmic cut”, i.e. one camera position
immediately follows another camera position, or by a "pan",
i.e. a static camera that continuously turns, or by a "move",
i.e. the camera moves around the scene and thereby also
continuously shows the scene from the various viewpoints.
Empirical literature is ambiguous whether all of these filmic
strategies are well adapted to the cognitive processes of
observers: Some studies showed that e.g. filmic cuts are
understood even by completely media inexperienced people
(Messaris, 1994), whereas other researchers postulate that
only continuously changing viewpoints reflect the biological
possible everyday experience of humans and therefore
should be understood better than abrupt viewpoint changes
(Gibson, 1982). Supporting this latter idea Kipper (1986)
found that recall and recognition of a static scene was better
if during the initial presentation of the scene the transition
between various viewpoints was realized by a moving
camera instead of simply adding segments with different
viewpoints directly together.
   On the one hand several findings from static scenes could
also be replicated for dynamic scenes, indicating some
commonalities in spatial representation of static and
dynamic scenes (Garsoffky et al., 2002). But on the other
hand dealing now with questions of presentation mode, the
observer´s situation strongly differs between the reception               Figure 1: Section of a basketball scene seen from
