children’s performance, and the positive relation between
estimation proficiency and math achievement (Dowker, 2003;
Siegler & Booth, 2004), have led educators to assign a high
priority to improving estimation for many years (e.g., NCTM,
1980, 2001). Despite this prolonged effort, most children’s
estimation skills continue to be poor (Siegler & Booth, 2005).
   One likely reason for failures to help children estimate more
accurately is that little is known about the representations and
processes that underlie estimation, much less about how they
develop or what types of experiences produce improvement in
them. To help address these limitations of current
understanding, we examine in this study how children’s choice
of representations contributes to their difficulties with
estimation. We also propose and test the log discrepancy
hypothesis, which predicts the relative effectiveness of different
types of experiences for improving children’s estimates.
   Our account of the development of estimation begins with
the assumption that 5- to 10-year-olds’ difficulties are due in
large measure to inappropriate choices of numerical
representation. Specifically, although children in this age range
appear to possess multiple representations of numerical
magnitudes, they often use an early-developing logarithmic
representation (a representation within which the magnitudes                 Figure 1: Discrepancy between a logarithmic and linear

0-1,000. Then the experimenter wrote the number
corresponding to the child’s mark (Nestimate) above the mark,
and indicated the correct location of the number that had been
presented (N) with a hatch mark. After this, the experimenter
showed the corrected number line to the child. Pointing to the
child’s mark, she said, “You told me that N would go here.
Actually, this is where N goes (pointing). The line that you
marked is where Nestimate actually goes.” When children’s
answers deviated from the correct answer by no more than
10%, the experimenter said, “You can see these two lines are
really quite close. How did you know to put it there?” When
children’s answers deviated from the correct answer by more
than 10%, the experimenter said, “That’s quite a bit too
high/too low. You can see these two lines [the child’s and
experimenter’s hatch marks] are really quite far from each
other. Why do you think that this is too high/low for N?”
