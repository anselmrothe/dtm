   incompatible theories: the internal clock and the attentional
   counter theory. Based on a dual timing task experiment we
   conclude that a symbiosis of both theories is necessary to
   explain all the phenomena found in our experiment and in the
   experiments we review. This conclusion is supported by the
   computational models we present of the experiments.
                     Interval Estimation
The human ability to routinely estimate short time intervals
plays an important role in everyday life. Time estimates
play a role in situations where we take an action and expect
some response, for example when we click on a link in a
web-browser, in real-world decisions, for example judging
whether we should brake for a yellow traffic light or not,
and in multi-tasking situations where we have to
strategically switch between tasks, for example using a                        Figure 1: Results of Zakay’s (1993) experiment.

  mechanism. The Zakay experiment mainly proves there is
  some effect of attention, but not necessarily that the role of
  attention is to keep an explicit cognitive count. The internal
  clock theory by itself does not really deal with attention, or
  other aspects of cognition. With this in mind we (Taatgen,
  van Rijn & Anderson, 2004) designed an internal clock
  module for the ACT-R architecture. This module can not
  only model timing experiments like the Rakitin et al. (1998)
  experiment, but can also shed some light on how timing
  interacts with other aspects of cognition, including attention.                Figure 3: Illustration of the temporal module

     The goal of our present study is to reconcile the
  experimental results from the attentional and internal clock
  theories. Our model will use an internal clock that will keep
  track of time on its own account. To keep track of time,
  however, this clock has to be explicitly attended, at least in
  the initial stages of learning.

                  Figure 5: the dual timing task
Figure 5 outlines the task. The display consists of two
boxes, a high profit box on the left, and a low profit box on
the right. In each of these boxes stimuli can appear, to which
the participant has to respond. Stimuli are buttons with,
depending on the condition, an addition with one-digit
numbers or a letter. Additions can either be correct or wrong
by one, and letters are either “A” or “B”. Participants have
to respond to correct additions and “A”’s by clicking on
them when they are in the right box, or by pressing space on
the keyboard with the left hand when they are in the left
box. In the right box stimuli appear for 1200 ms, with
between 0 and 2000 ms in between. Stimuli in the left box
do not appear by themselves: they have to be requested by
the participant by pushing the “Test High” button. Stimuli in
the left box are available in certain time periods, basically
six seconds on and seven seconds off. So at the start of the
experiment there are six seconds in which there are stimuli
available, then seven seconds without available stimuli, then
six seconds again with stimuli, etc. The end of a six second
period is always marked in the left box with a brief
appearance of the word “End”. Whenever the participant
presses the “Test High” button during a period with stimuli,
stimuli actually appear in the left box for the remainder of
that period. When the participant presses the “Test High”
button during the seven second period without stimuli,
nothing happens. Optimal behavior is therefore to press the
“Test High” button right at the beginning of the six second               Figure 6: Distribution of first-click times for both tasks

Skill acquisition
ACT-R’s rule learning mechanism, production compilation,
will gradually learn rules that correspond to cognitive
actions that are repeated often. For the present model, the
main rules of importance are rules that are associated with
retrieving previous experiences from memory. Initially, the
process of judging whether or not to click at a certain time
requires three steps:
     1. A production rule makes a retrieval request to
          declarative memory for a past experience about the
          present time (50 ms)
     2. Declarative memory tries to find a matching
          experience (can take up to 680 ms, depending on
          the activation of the experience)
     3. A rule that acts upon the retrieved experience fires
          (50 ms)
At any moment this process can be interrupted by a new
visual stimulus. However, once a certain experience has
been retrieved often enough, the three steps are collapsed
into a new rule specialized for that experience, for example:
IF the current time is 41 time ticks
THEN press the test-button
This new rule only takes 50 ms to execute, and has therefore
a much higher probability to fire at the appropriate time.

Model results
We ran the model 200 times for each of the four conditions,
and then averaged the results. The model produces time
distributions that are quite similar to the distributions found
in the experiment (Figure 10). Although the differences
between the two distributions are subtle, it shares two
characteristics with the experimental data: the peak of the
distribution is slightly higher for the letter task, and there is
a slight shift to the right in the distribution of the Addition
task. These two aspects become also clear if we look at the
average response times and average deviations from the
optimal time. Figure 11 shows the average deviations from
the optimal response time, and Figure 12 the average
response times relative to the optimal response time.                     Figure 11: Average absolute deviation from optimal click
