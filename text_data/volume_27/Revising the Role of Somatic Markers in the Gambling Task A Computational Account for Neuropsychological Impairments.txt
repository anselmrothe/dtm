and deck selection are ruled by two Boltzmann equations reg-
ulated by the two temperatures τ1 and τ2 . The process of deck
evaluation is represented in Figure 2.
   In short, normal participants could correctly recall, and
therefore evaluate, the risks following a bad deck choice.
When sampling for negative consequences, their retrieval
process is not undermined by interference from other ma-
terial, and has the opportunity to take into consideration a
broader range of possible results.
   On the contrary, orbitofrontal patients cannot take advan-
tage of the additive contextual activation that flows from the
associative paths created by the orbitofrontal cortex. This fact
makes them prone to perseverations over the intruding pos-
itive outcomes, and makes them less aware of the possible
aversive upshots.
   It may be argued that, contrary to our hypothesis, a task
as simple and repetitive as the Iowa Gambling Task could be
performed procedurally, with the action of choosing from the
good decks being routinized.
   However, Stout, Rodawalt, & Siemers (2001) have shown
that patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease, that disrupts
the capability of acquiring procedural knowledge (Knowlton,
Mangels, & Squire, 1996), are not impaired in the Iowa Gam-
bling Task.

   We had the model run 1,000 times in this conditions, then
we averaged the data for good and bad deck selections. The
results are reported in Figure 4a, together with experimental
data derived from Bechara et al. (1999). As could be ex-
pected, the model exhibits the same results obtained from the
patients.
Simulating a Working Memory Impairment
An important indirect evidence in support of the implicit role
of emotion in driving cognition come from an experiment by
Bechara, Tranel, Damasio, & Anderson (1998). They con-
trasted performance of two groups of frontal patients. One
group was composed by individuals with focal lesions to the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), while the other com-
prised only patients with an injury in the ventromedial part of
prefrontal cortex, having the dorsolateral region spared. Both
groups were tested on two paradigms: a working memory
task and the Gambling Task.
   Results evidenced a double dissociation, with DLPFC pa-
tients selectively impaired in the working memory task but
not with the Gambling Task, while the others exhibited the
opposite pattern. A similar dissociation was taken as evi-
