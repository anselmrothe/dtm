figure reconstruction (Wagemans, 1995). The form of
symmetry we perceive is usually understood to be exact or
quantitative symmetry, where (for mirror symmetric
figures) quantities such as angle and length are identical on
both sides of an axis. Understanding symmetry as exact
symmetry has lead to simple but useful models of symmetry
detection based on the transformational invariance of a
figure. Yet as useful as these models are, they fall short
when applied to approximate or qualitative symmetry,
which is problematic given that many real-world objects
(such as human figures) display approximate symmetry.
   The MAGI model of regularity detection (Ferguson,
1994, 2001) accounts for qualitative symmetry detection by
modeling it as a mapping process that aligns similar
qualitative relations and features (such as line intersections             Figure 1: Polygon demonstrating             qualitative   and
and boundary concavities) using a structure mapping                        quantitative differences.

features have the same qualitative value but differ in their
exact value (e.g., both are concave, but one is more concave
than the other). A polygon contains a qualitative difference
if a pair of corresponding features differ in their qualitative
value (e.g. one is concave and one is convex).
   Exactly this effect was shown for qualitative and
quantitative differences in two experiments by Ferguson,
Aminoff, & Gentner (1996). In these experiments,
participants judged the symmetry of random 12- and 16-
gons displayed for 50 msecs. The results showed that
qualitative differences in a stimulus improved participant
accuracy and response time. In both experiments, human
participants were faster or more accurate at judging
asymmetric figures with qualitative differences than with
quantitative differences. This result supports use of an             Figure 2: Representative stimuli from the experiment. The

 the next trial.
    Eye movements (Figure 4) were recorded using a corneal
 reflection eye-tracking device. Eye positions were sampled
 at a rate of 120 Hz. For analysis, a fixation was detected if a
 minimum of 200ms of samples were in the same location. A
 microphone recorded participants’ responses. Participants
 were given 144 trials, where factors were interleaved.
 Because the stimulus order was fixed, we checked for order
 effects in the mean fixations between the first and second
 halves of the stimulus set but found no evidence of an order
 effect on accuracy (F(1,142)=0, p>0.9).

assertion that the visual system is significantly more

relational difference, rather than a difference of degree. In
addition, it provides some evidence that symmetry-based
lateral bias occurs in near-symmetric as well as symmetric
figures.
  However, we must consider at least two possible
alternative explanations for effects of symmetry type. First,
we must consider whether participants were wholly better at
classifying figures with qualitative differences, or were
improving their accuracy by delaying their response.
Second, we must consider whether the distinction between               Figure 9: Interval plot of response time for symmetry type
