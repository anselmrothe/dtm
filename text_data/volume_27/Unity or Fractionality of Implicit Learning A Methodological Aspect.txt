left to right using the arrows. Each passed arrow adds one letter to
the string.
   In the first part of the experiment (training phase) the
participant has to learn strings of letters. After the appearance
of each grammatical string the person has to repeat the correct
string. After 50 correctly repeated string comes the second
part, the grammatical prediction phase. In this phase the
participants are tested about their knowledge of the hidden
rule by informing them of the existence of a set of rules
governing the structure of the training items - although they
were not told what those rules were - and then asking them to
