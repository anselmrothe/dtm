Procedure In the training phase, participants were first
shown an animation where a man’s face morphed into a
woman’s as an example of a transition from an instance of
one category to another. They were told that they would be
watching similar transitions with two novel categories and
had to learn to identify the boundary point. On each trial,
an animation across a single row or column (depending on
the condition) was shown and participants were to press the
space bar at the point they guessed the boundary was crossed.
When they pressed the space bar a beep would sound (and
the precise point in time would be recorded), but the anima-
tion always continued to its conclusion. At the end of the
trial, feedback was given as to the position of the participant’s
guess relative to the category boundary by displaying what
the shape looked like at the point of the guess and point-                      Figure 4: Screen shot of feedback given during Training phase.
