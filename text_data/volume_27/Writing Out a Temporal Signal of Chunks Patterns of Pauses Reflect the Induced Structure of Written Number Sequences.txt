Abstract

of the initial extraction, analysis and coding of digitally
recorded writing actions, without substantial manual effort
(although current tools are research prototypes).
To fully exploit the potential of writing some
methodological and theoretical advances are required. The
aims of this paper are (a) to show the potential of writing by
introducing a particular approach to the studying of a
chunking phenomenon and (b) to demonstrate the strength
and robustness of the data that can be obtained. In
particular, the focus is on the extent to which the patterns of
pauses between written elements, in this case sets of digits,
reveals the structure of chunks in working memory. As will
be seen the duration of pauses between written elements
strongly and clearly reflects the structure of the chunks and
so provides a distinct temporal signal of chunks.
Given the fundamental role of chunks in the cognitive
architecture, it would be a revelation if the process of
writing did not depend on the chunks in memory and if
behavioural measures of writing did not reflect the structure
of the chunks. Nevertheless, it is imaginable that process of
writing could be dissociated from the structure of chunks in
working memory in substantive ways. Writing is a complex
skill that takes years to fully master and could involve the
development of complex processes specific to this activity.
Such a process might, for instance, specially recode chunks
into a fixed uniform size in order to optimize the planning
and execution of actual motor behaviours, which would
mask the structure of the original chunks. Existing evidence
does suggest that this is not the case. One aim of the
experiment reported here is to provide more direct evidence
of the existence of a temporal signal of chunks.
To concentrate on the effects of chunks on the writing
process it is necessary to attempt to isolate the basic process
from others that reflect chunk structure in behaviour
measures, in particular, the effect of the recall of chunks
from long term memory. Thus, simple sequences of
numbers with regular structure were designed that could be
quickly learned and that would not require deep coding by
participants before they could begin writing. Further, the
sequences were designed so that alternative patterns could
be imposed on them, so that participants would process
alternative chunk structures although the underlying set of
numbers was the same. The three groups of three sequences
used in the experiment are shown in Fig. 1. The alternative
chunk patterns were induced in working memory by telling
the participants the nature of the target pattern and having
them read the target pattern written in words. For example,

Writing may be an effective approach to the study of
cognitive phenomena that involve the processing of chunks.
This paper provides evidence for the existence of a substantial
and robust temporal signal in the process of writing that
reveals information about the structure of chunks in working
memory. Specifically, it is demonstrated that in the writing of
simple number sequences the duration of pauses between
written elements (digits) that are within a chunk are shorter
than the pauses between elements across the boundary of
chunks. This temporal signal is apparent in un-aggregated
data for individual participants in single trials.

Introduction
The idea of chunking of information is one of the
cornerstones of cognitive science. It underpins accounts of
memory, skilled performance, knowledge representation,
learning and so forth (e.g., Chi, Glaser, & Farr, 1988;
Goodnow & Levine, 1973; Miyake & Shah, 1999; Cowan,
2001). Substantial work has been done to understand the
role of chunks in perception and the central processes of the
cognitive architecture (e.g., Chase & Simon, 1973; Gobet &
Simon, 1998; Egan & Schwartz, 1979; Reitman, 1976;
Vincente, 1988, Cheng, McFadzean & Copeland, 2001).
Further, there is also evidence that chunks are important in
the programs that govern motor behaviour and that such
programs appear to have a hierarchical structure (e.g.,
Rosenbaum, Hindorff & Munro, 1987).
Many approaches have been used to probe the nature of
chunks and related cognitive phenomena but writing has not
been great among of them. Where ordinary writing by hand
has been used for this purpose, it has typically been in the
context of simple response latency tasks (e.g., Lochy,
Pillon, Zesiger, & Seron, 2002). The relative neglect of
writing is surprising given the range and extent of the
potential benefits. Writing is an integral part of many tasks,
so the problems associated with requiring participants to
perform addition activities in order to generate a
behavioural data stream is avoided (cf., concurrent
verbalizations). Unlike response latency tasks that are
rather artificial activities, writing can be more naturalistic,
even in an experimental context. The density of data that
can be obtained may also be substantial, both in terms of the
range of measurable parameters and the number of data
points per trial. Computer tools can automatically do much
424

the interpretation and number sequence 1A is ‘500 repeated
and separated by numbers counting from 1’ and the wording
was ‘Hash, five hundred, one, five hundred, two, five
hundred, three, etc’. For 1B they were, respectively,
‘Counting up in ones from five thousand and one’ and
‘Hash, five thousand and one, five thousand and two etc’.
The participants recited the target wording until they were
sufficiently familiar with it that they could write it in a
continuous unhesitating manner. The hash (#) at the
beginning of each sequence is initially written so that the
writing process is well underway before the first digit is
generated.
To determine whether the structure of chunks has a role in
the processes of writing the duration of pauses between
drawn elements was recorded in the experiment. Using a
graphics tablet different elements could be identified by
whether the pen was in contact with the tablet. The pause
before a particular element is operationally defined as the
difference in the time between (a) when the pen was last
lifted from the tablet on completion of the preceding
element and (b) when it again touched the tablet at the
beginning of the element under consideration. The
participants wrote the digits within a horizontal row of
equally space squares separate by small gaps, as shown in
Fig. 2. This allowed the transition between successive
digits to be automatically distinguished. The pauses can be
coded at three levels: L0 – within a digit; L1 – a digit within
a chunk; L2 – a digit beginning a new chunk (as defined in
Fig. 1). The L2 coding depends on the given chunk pattern.
L0 pauses were relatively rare and so are not considered in
this paper.

Fig. 1. Experiment number sequence chunking patterns
A standard graphics tablet was used (Wacon, Intuos2®)
connected to a personal computer. Points were sampled at a
rate of more than 36 Hz and at an accuracy of better than an
order of magnitude smaller than the shortest pauses. A
specially written program, TRACE, was used to record the
writing actions and to extract the pen positions, times of
points and pauses (Cheng & Rojas-Anaya, 2004).
The data for each of the written sequences for each
participant was initially treated individually.

Results
The presentation of the results will start with data for
individuals doing a particular number sequence and proceed
towards a global overview. Different level of aggregation
of data will thus be considered and so it is worth introducing
a little terminology to differentiate them. Data for an
individual-sequence covers a trial of one written number
sequence by one participant. Each participant produced
nine such individual-sequences and there were a total of 90
in the experiment. A participant set of data covers all of the
number sequences written by one participant. There were
ten in the experiment. A sequence set of data covers all 10
participants writing the same number sequence and there are
nine such in the experiment.
The pause durations for all written elements was
calculated. Each of the marks made were coded as being an
element within a digit (L0), as a digit within a chunk (L1),
or as the first digit of a chunk (L2). As is typical with pause
data for chunking production behaviours, the magnitudes of
between chunk pauses is skewed, so medians and nonparametric statistics will typically be reported here.

Experiment: Writing numbers sequences
There were 10 participants, who were postgraduate students
and members of research staff at the University of Sussex.
After familiarization with writing on the tablet and
some training on a set of dummy sequences the participant
wrote each of the nine sequences. One sequence from each
set of three, in Fig. 1, was done in turn before returning to
another sequence from the same set, otherwise the order of
stimuli presentation was random.
Each number sequence was written on a card with the
description of the pattern and the precise wording to be
recited, shown most prominently. After familiarization with
the number sequence, the experimenter checked the
accuracy of verbalization of the participants, and they then
wrote the number sequence in the row of squares provided
whilst simultaneous reciting the sequence again. This was
to ensure there was no recoding of the sequence by the
participants.

two graphs despite the same underlying set of numbers
being written. The pattern of pauses clearly reflects the
chunk structure imposed by the specific stimuli
interpretation given with each number sequence.
The graphs in Fig. 3 are quite typical for this participant
across the sequences and also quite representative of the
other participants. It is noteworthy that the data correspond
to a single individual on a single trial (i.e., not aggregated
data). Inspection of all the graphs for all the participants’
gives a distinct impression there is a temporal signal that
reflects the individual chunk structure of each sequence.

Fig. 2 shows a screen snap shot from the TRACE graphical
recording and analysis program for the writing of sequence
1A by one participant. The small circles superimposed on
each written digit indicate the beginning and end of the
production of those digits with the pen touching and leaving
the paper. The lines between digits indicate transitions
between squares where the pen is off the paper. Note the
two pairs of dots on the ‘4’ digit, which indicates that it was
written in two parts. TRACE calculates the pauses between
all of the elements.
Fig. 3 shows two graphs of the sequence of pause
durations for the same participant writing sequence 1A and
1B. The number sequence is shown below the graph with
each chunk aligned to their respective data points. The solid
line gives the pause durations. The dashed line (arbitrary
units) indicates expected chunk level, whether it is an L2
data point (100 units), an L1 point (50 units), or an L0 point
(zero units). An indication of the match between the
expected chunk structure and the durations of the pauses can
be judged by comparing the shape of the solid and dashed
lines (not their absolute magnitudes). The duration of the
pauses reflects these chunk related levels reasonable well,
but not perfectly. The pauses with the greatest magnitudes
typically occur at the beginning of a new chunk.
The distribution of the longer pauses is different in the

Within and between chunk pause durations
For each individual-sequence the L1 (within chunk) and L2
(between chunk) pauses were considered. All 90 individualsequence medians were computed and Mann-Whitney U
computed to test the whether the difference between L1 and
L2 pauses was likely to have been due to chance variations.
Table 1 presents the participant medians for the within and
between chunk pauses, and the difference between them
(L2-L1). The outcomes of the Mann-Whitney test are
summarized in terms of the number of sequences in which
the difference between the L1 and L2 pauses was
significant.
For every number sequence across all the participants
the median of the within chunk pause duration was less than
that of the between chunk pause duration. Of the 90

individual-sequences, this difference was significant for 81
of the cases with p<.05. This is noteworthy given the data is
not aggregated over participants or sequences.
Overall, the magnitude of L2 pauses was 60% greater
than the L1 pauses, with a typical difference between the
levels of 181 ms.

difference is greater than for the sequence with smaller
chunks, with the former being double the latter.
It appears that the particular structure of the chunk
pattern underlying each sequence influences the duration of
the pauses between chunks, with larger chunks having a
greater duration. The effect on within chunk pauses does
not show any particular trend with the size of the chunk.

Relation of pause duration and chunk size

Chunk structure in temporal patterns

Fig. 4 presents pause data for each number sequence. The
means of the individual-sequence medians are plotted, as the
data across individuals for each sequence is not skewed (in
contrast to the data across sequences for individuals). The
variability of L1 pauses is smaller (range = 86 ms) than the
variability of the L2 pauses (range = 168 ms). The data
points in the graph have been ordered with respect to the
magnitude of the means of the difference between L2 and
L1 durations. The pattern for each sequence is given, under
the name of the sequence. It indicates the length of the
chunks and the underlying repetition of the chunk pattern.
There is a general trend. For the larger chunks the L2-L1

To test more rigorously whether the patterns of pauses
genuinely is a signal that reflects the imposed chunk pattern
a further analysis was carried out. The pause values for
each individual-sequence was coded using the other two
alternative incorrect target chunk structures from the same
set and new median values of the L2 and L1 pauses found.
(In Fig. 3, this is equivalent to swapping the dashed lines for
expected chunks patterns between the two graphs.)
Table 2 presents the sequence means for each number
sequence for codings using all three target chunk patterns,
including the correct pattern (in bold): the top number in
each cell. The stimuli chunk patterns occupy the main rows
and the coding patterns are in the main columns. The
underlying chunk pattern for each sequence is provided in
the brackets after the label for the sequence. The second
number in each cell is the difference between the L2-L1
differences for the alternative and correct coding. Small
values or negative values indicate that the alternative coding
is as good as, or better than, the coding for the actual
stimulus. The third number in the cells gives the number of
individual-sequences for which the difference between the
L1 and L2 pauses are significant, using a Mann-Whitney
test with p<.05. Locations of cells in the tables will be
referred using pairs of sequences labels, with the first
referring to the stimulus pattern (rows) and the second to the
coding pattern (columns) (e.g., 1A-1C = top row and right
column).
Some interesting regularities are apparent. The
magnitude of the L2-L1 difference for the alternative coding
is less than the respective value for the correct coding, with
two exceptions (1C-1B and 3A-3C). For the alternative
codings the numbers of individual-sequences with a
significant difference between the L2 and L1 levels is
typically less than the correct coding and only in one case
equal to it (3A-3C). This suggests that, in general, the
match of the stimulus chunk pattern to the recorded
structure of the pauses is due to the actual chunk pattern.

Other interesting regularities can be seen in Table 2.
Spurious positive codings occur when (a) the alternative
coding approaches the success of the correct stimuli
coding, with the difference between its L2-L1 value
approaching (or better) than that of the correct coding
(middle number in a cell is less than, say, 70 ms) and (b)
the number of individual-sequences that are significant
approaches that of the correct coding. These positive
codings are highlighted by the underlining of their values
in Table 2. The expected negative alternative codings are
those that do not satisfy the criteria. Now, examining the
difference between the two types of coding it can be seen
that the sequences that give the expected negative coding
are quite distinct from the stimuli patterns, whereas the
patterns that give the spurious positive codings can be
interpreted as larger chunks that group together the stimuli
chunks. For instance the 1A stimulus has repeated sets of 3
and 1 letters and the 1B alternative coding is a simple
repeat of sets of 4 letters. Case 3C-3B is an exception,
because the stimulus pattern (sets of 4) is not “subsumed”
by the alternative coding (a 2-2 pattern), but the simple
relation of two equal parts in one is likely to be responsible
for the positive match of the 3B pattern.
Hence, there is a plausible explanation for the
unexpected successful match of the alternative coding
patterns and stimuli: the coding pattern has a substantially
similar structure to the stimuli pattern. The positive
codings are not actually as spurious as they initially seem,
but are manifestation of a pattern shared by the correct and
the alternative coding. The existence of these alternative
positive codings may be interpreted as lending weight to,
rather than detracting from, the claim that patterns of
pauses constitutes a temporal signal of the structure of the
chunks.

Discussion
The experiment provides evidence for the existence of a
strong and robust temporal signal present in the pattern of
the durations of pauses between written elements that
directly reflects the structure of the chunks in memory.
This illustrates the potential of using writing as a means to
study cognitive phenomena that are underpinned by the
processing of chunks.
The signal is manifest as longer pause durations
between written elements that fall at the boundary between
chunks and shorter pause durations for elements within a
chunk. The typical within chunk pause (L1) was 280 ms
and the typical between chunk pause (L2) was 440 ms.
The typical difference between pauses levels was 180 ms
(and greater than the arithmetic difference because of the
positive skew of the data). However, there is considerable
variability across individual and between sequences. The
L2-L1 differences for individuals, with data aggregated
across sequences, ranges from 64 to 254 ms. Aggregating
over the participants, the range of L2-L1 differences is
from 126 to 304 ms, with a suggestion that the values
increase with chunk size.

Acknowledgment

The existence of the different pause durations for
different levels of components within a chunk is consistent
with established findings about the nature of chunking and
memory recall. However, the results here contrast with
previous findings. In particular the pause durations are
much shorter than the 2-5 s thresholds that are often used as
means to discriminate between elements at the boundary of
chunks from those within (Card, et al., 1983). Part of the
difference is explained by the minimal need to recall chunks
for long-term memory in the present number sequence task
(cf. Chase & Simon, 1973; Reitman, 1976; Egan and
Schwartz, 1979). Some of the difference may also be due to
the to the actual process of writing as opposed to other
means of behavioural output, such as physical item
placement or drawing (e.g., Cheng, et al., 2001). The
relative simplicity of the task may be another contributor.
The question of the relative contribution of these factors is a
question for further investigation. Short pause duration
were found in verbal production of letter sequences
(McLean & Gregg, 1956).
The temporal signal appears to be strong and robust.
The between chunk pauses are more than 60% greater than
the within chunk pauses. In 90% of the individualsequences significant differences were found; i.e., using unaggregated data at the level of single trials done by one
participant at a time. The recoding of the data for each
individual-sequence using the other sequences in the same
group provides further evidence of the reality of the
temporal signal. When the pattern in the alternative coding
was clearly distinct from the target stimulus structure the
difference between the chunk levels disappeared. Further,
when the pattern happened to be consistent by virtue of
being a simple aggregation of pairs of chunks in the
stimulus, then the difference in duration between the coded
chunk levels remained.
It is an open question whether the strength of the signal
will be diminished with more complex stimuli, involving
larger chunks, less regular patterns or more hierarchical
levels. Such stimuli could, of course, encompass written
natural language.
The experiment presented here also stands as a
demonstration of one methodology that uses writing in the
study of chunking phenomena. Some features of the
approach are worth emphasizing. The relative long
sequences of items (20 digits here) gives a high density of
data per trial and permits relatively complex chunk
structures to be used. The regular grid (Fig. 2) facilities the
automated coding of drawing strokes associated with the
start of particular items and chunks. The “mismatch”
analysis using the alternative coding patterns, Table 2,
provides a simple means to test the reality of the patterns of
pauses and identifies patterns of chunks that are related (i.e.,
the apparently spurious positive codings). Cheng et al.
(2001) used a somewhat similar approach in the context of
hierarchical geometrical drawings and also found a strong
and robust temporal signal of chunks.
