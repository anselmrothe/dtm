Abstract
The concept of cognitive styles is frequently applied in the field of
educational systems research (Chou, Chan & Lin, 2003). Roberts
and Newton (2001) suggested that although the concept of
cognitive styles is a useful starting point, it is unable to account for
many finds in the literature, and that any model of strategy usage
that is reduced itself to mechanisms governing strategy selection is
incomplete. It is necessary to consider which strategies people
have available and how they discover new ones. Therefore, the aim
of the present study was to investigate the learning strategies of
undergraduate students of Psychology and Computing Sciences
courses in order to explore possible variables to implement in a
Intelligent Tutorial System. Thus, to evaluate learning strategies,
the Ross Test of Cognitive Process, which evaluates the student
individual performance of thinking process and strategies, was
used. The results suggests that each group have different learning
strategies choices. According to this, it is discussed the use of
learning strategies to implement educational systems.

Educational systems
Educational systems are a kind of system which act
as tutor and it is known as Intelligent Tutor System (ITS).
The ITS are systems which help in learning process and
permit the devolpment of a cooperative enviroment between
system and student. The objective of these systems is to
improve learning process, promote cognitive flexibility and
guide the students through learning process. This objetive is
made through identification of students interests and needs.
So, these systems work with the individual differences of
students, including cognitive/learning styles (Carver et al,
1996; Papanikolaou et el, 2001; Triantafillou, 2003).
The Educational Systema is compound by three
modules: Dominium Module (set of dominium content);
Student Module (student features); Adaptative Module
(according student’s cognitive/learning style and
information, the dominium content is adapted). The
modules work integrated with different aspects of learning

1391

process, adapting the content according student’s
knowledge, combining presentation mídias of the content,
adapting learning strategies (tactics) and modifing examples
and links.
There are two principal systems: Intelligent Tutor
System (ITS) and Companion System. The main focus of
ITS is manage with students individual necessities and give
an adaptative feedback of the system to the student. The ITS
must comprehend student’s need and offer interactive
strategies to the student. In general, these systems have four
modules (Wenger, 1987): Dominium Module (Knowledge
which represents learning objectives); Student Module
(detects student’s beliefs, actions and mistakes. It is used to
give adaptative feedback to the student); Pedagogical
Module (it is the pedagogical strategies used to guide
student’s interaction with the system); Interface
(comunication module with student). The other system,
Companion System, uses educational agent in its structure
and this agent has two plays: intelligent tutor and learning
companion (Chou et al, 2003). A leaning companion acts
like a student’s companion during interaction and offer
activities within the enviroment, it can colaborate or
compete like a human student. The human student can
observe campanion’s actions while solving problems or
explaing the solutions as a part of programmed actions of
the companion. The purpouse of the enviorment is to use
several companion’s agent in order to identify student’s
features such introvertion, extrovertion, among others. This
agents are a kind of educational agents with human
caracteristics (showed by text, graphs, icons, voice,
animation, and others) which facilitates social learning.
The pedagogical and didatic propousals of software
products with ITS caracteristics are extenses (Corredor,
1993), because it confirms the importance of student’s
individual features, recognizing that instruction could be
individualize in order to facilitate the development of
student’s conceptual and methodological structures

according to his/her capacities and interests. Since the 80’s
there are several studies with substantial evidencies showing
that the use of ITSs improve student’s performance who
interact with these enviroments in relation to thouse who
interact in traditional classroom (Cutmore, Hine, Maberly,
Langford & Hawgood, 2000; Lee, Cheng, Rai, Depickere,
2004; Rau, Choog & Salvendy, 2004; Workman, 2004).
However, there are still several critics in relation to the
relaybility of these results because there are different
enviroment (virtual and real), leading to different variables.
Moreover, different pedagogical and methodological
concepts are used, so the comparison and the validity within
these results are not reliable (Roberts & Newton, 2001).

Aim of the study
The aim of the present study was to investigate the
learning strategies of undergraduate students of Psychology
and Computing Sciences courses in order to explore
possible variables to implement in a Intelligent Tutorial
System.

Method
Paticipants: 135 undergradute students (79 from

Computing Science and 56 from Psychology), with age
between 18 to 40, was invited to participate in the study.

Instruments and Material: The Ross Test of Cognitive
Process was used to measure cognitive strategies. The main
objective of the test is to avaliate student’s individual
performance in thinking processes (Ross & Ross, 1976).
The test was conceivied to measure 3 general abilities,
analyses, sintheses and avaliation, and in each of the 8
subtest (Analogy, Deductive Reasoning, Missing Sentences,
Abstract Relations, Sequential Sintheses, Questioning
Strategies, Relevant and Irrelevant Information, and
Attribute Analyses) specific habilities are defined (table 1).

Cognitive Style / Learning Style
The concept of cogntive style refers to a consistent
and distint way a person has to coding, organizing and
performing with information, leading to a cognitive
managent of learning strategies (Riding & Cheema, 1991;
Atkinson, 1998; Souto, Verdin, Wainer, Madeira, Vicari &
Oliveria, 2002). Cognitive style implies in a cognitive
control which gives organizational and representational
interfaces of inner state and extirior world (Riding, 1997;
2000). Thus, cognitive style and learning style could be just
different names to the same caracteristic. However, SandlerSmith (2001) point out that cognitive style is an independent
caracteristic from personality, as well as cognitive style is
independent from learning style, which would involve
comprehention,
tranformation,
representation
and
organization. Moreover, the author suggest that both styles
are complementaries.
In educational system research the concept of
cognitive style is widely used (Chou, Chan & Lin, 2003).
Roberts and Newton (2001) suggested that although
cognitive style is a very important starting point, there are in
the literatura several evidences showing that any model of
estrategies use which resume itself to a mechanisms that
govern strategies selection is imcomplete. It is necessery to
consider which strategies people have and how they
discover new ones. In real world, a variety of strategies are
used, even in the most ordinary task, and this is a testimony
of human capacities of thinking and imagining. Roberts
(1993, 2000) concluded that for any task which involves
thinking, problem solving or judment, in which individual
diferences in the use of strategies are pratically inevitable,
the research which assumes that people use same methods
will inevitablely fail. In contrast, efforts could be directed to
comprehend individual diferences about strategies uses. To
this author, strategy would be any procedure that is not
obligate or have a directed goal, been a set of cognitive
processes which, in theory, could be modify , i.e., through
discovery or instruction. Therefore, the processual
constitutes of certain cognitive activities could be imutable,
i. e. , visual perception, and the process used in other
activities could be modify at any moment, and a set modify
cognitive processes could constitute a new strategy.

Procedures: The test session took place in a classroom

and thouse students who did not want to take part of the
study could leave the room freely.

Results and Discussion
To a better analyses of the results, the sample was
divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (Pschology students) and
Group 2 (Computing Science students). Through the analyses
of the test, there is a small difference about reasoning
strategies used in both groups (Tabelas 2 and 3). Although,
the variance within the students was very large. In group 1,
subtests with bigger means were Deductive Reasoning (RD),
Attribute Analyses (AT) and Missing Sentences (PA),
respectively, 58,286; 57,143 e 56,929. On the other group,
the sutests with bigger means were Relevant and Irrelevant
Information (IN), Attribute Analyses (AT) and Deductive
Reasoning (RD), respectively 74,114; 72,608 e 69,481.

construct considering student’s learning strategies. The
author suggest that within teaching plan it should be consider
the strategies that are less used by the student in order to
develop a reasoning flexibility.
The present study indicates that there is a strong
variation within students in relation to strategies use.
However, the test gives some intersting variables to built an
educational system based on prefered strategies, opening a
possibility to have a system which could be capable not just
to instruct students about chosen dominium of content, but
also to make possible the development of metacognitive
abilities.

In the field of educational systems, cognitive style
is used to built student module which shows the consistent
and distint way a person has to coding, organizing and
performing information, leading to a cogntive management
of learning strategies. So cognitive style implies in a
cognitive control of organization and representation, but not
to a fixed group of learning strategies. Thus, in order to
improve student´s ability to acquare information it is
necessary to consider which are the most frequent learning
strategies he/she uses or his/her learning style. Moreover, if
we consider that depending on the content to be acquared by
the student, he/she has to show some cognitive flexibility to
adapt old strategies or create new ones, this means that new
strategies were created in order to provide information to be
coded, represented and organized according to caracteristic
student’s cogntive style. As a result, the concept of cognitive
style implies in a personality caracteristic while learning
style implies in a group of tools used to access information,
showing an adaptative component of student´s learning
process (Sandler-Smith, 2001).
In every Educational System the principal goal is
to promote cognitive flexibility and guide the students
through learning process. To achive these objectives the
system must be capable to adapt itself to the learning needs
and interests of the students. So, using learning styles
concept it is possible to arrange a variety of variables that are
independet of cognitive style and personality, but have
correlations to these. This makes the systema more capable
of adaptability, specialy to promoto cognitive flexibility.
Moreover, this variable makes possible to identify student’s
preferences in relation to content structure, because cognitive
style refers to a cognitive control between inner state and
(representation) and external world. Thus, agregating
learning style to the student module would implies to built a
base of student’s strategies frequently used and also prepare
an adaptative module with tactic, knowledge, midias, links
and examples considering these strategies as a teaching plan.
According to Bloom (1976), all teaching plan should be
