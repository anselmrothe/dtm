novel problem-solving paradigm. If this were possible, it
would demonstrate that the PC error is a robust cognitive
phenomenon that occurs not only in routine procedural tasks
but also in problem-solving situations. The second aim of
the study was to establish whether the error rate is sensitive
to a simple change of interface (from text-based to menu-

  Further research could be directed to investigate cue
characteristics that best mitigate PC errors when the artefact
in use does not detect whether one has fulfilled one’s main
goal. In the current study, completion of the main goal
could not be detected by the system, whereas Chung &
Byrne’s interface could use a just-in-time cue because the
system could detect when the main goal had been achieved.
Other factors that might influence post-completion rates,
such as motivation, attention, interruptions, etc. remain to be
