Participants
Six female and six male participants, mainly students
between 20 and 31 (M=24; SD=3.3) participated in the
experiment which took place in Tübingen. All participants
were recruited in Freiburg a city about 200 km away from
Tübingen. They received a list of different cities in the
South of Germany and only those people who mentioned
having never been to Tübingen before were selected for the
study. The selected participants were German native
speakers and they were paid for their participation. They all
were transported by bus, from Freiburg to Tübingen, on the
morning of the study.
