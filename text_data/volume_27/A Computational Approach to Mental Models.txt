                Mental Model Algorithm
The Mental Model Algorithm (MMA) is proposed to
formally model spatial reasoning by using a simple
analogical representation in 3-D space to construct
coordinate boundaries of linguistically described spatial
relations. After spatial relations are plotted, an inference
process translates the spatial array back into linguistic            Figure 3: Three dimensional plane for inferring spatial
