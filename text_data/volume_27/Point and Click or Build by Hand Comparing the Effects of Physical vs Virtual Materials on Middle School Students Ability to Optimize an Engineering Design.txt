   Middle school students were used in the current study
rather than elementary school students because they may be
more likely to pick up on the subtle extra information
available with the physical materials. The younger students
in the prior study may not have had the capability to
integrate and use this extra information to their learning
advantage.
   One of the primary advantages of using a computer
interface is the potential for more efficient learning.
Completing one trial on a computer interface can be much
quicker than using physical materials because setting up the
test is just a few clicks and the results are shown almost
instantaneously. However, amount of time spent on a task is
often positively related to learning and, thus, the time-
savings may decrease learning. The current study examines             Figure 1: An example of a mousetrap car in the physical
