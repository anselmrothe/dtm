   Given such a strong influence of category validity, it
would be imperative to further examine whether clinicians’
estimates of category validity of features are accurate. If, as
our findings suggest, clinicians draw heavily on their sense
of category validity in weighing information for the purpose
of diagnosis, any misconceptions about category validity
will have important clinical applications.
