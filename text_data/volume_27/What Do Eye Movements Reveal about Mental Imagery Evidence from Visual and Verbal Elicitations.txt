movements when subjects listen to a complex description
that they are to mentally visualize.
    We present two studies of eye movements in three
description tasks: During the description of a previously
seen picture; while listening to a spoken description, and
during the retelling of a previously heard spoken
description. The hypothesis under examination is that the
eye movements in all three cases indicate the spatial
locations of objects from the picture and the description,
respectively. We also test the hypothesis whether the effect
is stronger in either condition.
