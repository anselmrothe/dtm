rational solution to this problem, but there can be plenty of
models trying to infer the future number according to the
past ones. The EFB problem has been applied to some
proto-market models: at each time step agents can buy (go
to the bar) or sell an asset and after each time step, the price
of the asset is determined by a simple supply-demand rule.
The MG has been first described in (Challet and Zhang,
1997) as a mathematical formalization and generalization of
EFB problem. It is assumed that an odd number of players
take a decision at each step of the simulation; the agents that
take the minority decision win, while the others loose.
   The EFB problem, as well as the MG in its original
formulation state that there is no communication among the
agents involved in the simulation; the original idea in this                      Figure 2: 100 Agents and 500 Links
example is to introduce in the model a sort of a social
network (Remondino and Cappellini, 2004), in order to see
how the links among certain agents can influence them. A
social network is defined as “a set of nodes - e.g. persons,
organizations - linked by a set of social relationship (edges)
of a specific type” (Laumann, et al., 1978). The following
example is useful to show that even using simple, reactive
agents, we can have realistic results from a simulation of a
complex social phenomenon.
The Simulation Framework
During the setup, we create a simple world populated by N                        Figure 3: 100 Agents and 5000 Links

social network and the links among them (relations) as the              This example proves the rule to be right and our model to

  A very different use of software agents is done with
deliberative agents, i.e. those endowed with the ability of
reasoning about actions and consequences. In the next
paragraph and example is shown of a theoretical model
employing BDI agents, a subset of deliberative ones.
