To evoke early linguistic disambiguation, temporal adverbs
biased the auxiliary wird toward either the future (“will”)
or passive (“is -ed”) reading. Since the verb was sentence-
final, the interplay of scene and linguistic cues (e.g., tem-
poral adverbs) were rather more subtle. When the listener
heard a future-biased adverb such as sogleich, after the auxil-
iary wird, he interpreted the initial NP as an agent of a future
construction, as evidenced by anticipatory eye-movements to
the patient in the scene. Conversely, listeners interpreted the
passive-biased construction with these roles exchanged.
