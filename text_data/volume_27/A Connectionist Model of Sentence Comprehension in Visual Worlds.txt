may speed up object identification, allowing early interpretation of a sentence where selectional restrictions on the verb
apply to only one depicted object (Altmann and Kamide,
1999). Such world knowledge may interact with linguistic
knowledge such as case markings to influence expectations
of post-verbal arguments and visual referents (Kamide et al.,
2003). Recent studies by Knoeferle et al. (2005) have also
shown that when scenes include depicted events, such visual
information can establish important relations between the entities, including role relations. These findings show that the
careful manipulation of information sources in an experimental setting can help shed considerable light on the underlying
processes involved in language comprehension.
Despite this important research, models of sentence comprehension continue to focus on modelling reading behavior.
To our knowledge, none attempt to model use of immediate
(non-linguistic) context. In this paper we present results from
two simulations using a Simple Recurrent Network (SRN; Elman, 1990) that has been modified to integrate input from a
scene with the traditional word-by-word processing in order
to demonstrate the adaptive use of the scene (when available) during comprehension. In addition to modelling the
characteristic behaviors of incrementality and anticipation,
we model people’s ability to use the contextual information
in visual scenes to more rapidly interpret and disambiguate a
sentence. In the modelling of five visual worlds experiments
reported in this paper, accurate sentence interpretation hinges
on proper case-role assignment to sentence participants. In
particular, modelling is focussed on the following aspects of
sentence processing:
• anticipation of role and filler
• adaptive use of the visual scene
• influence of depicted events on interpretation
• processing without the scene
• multiple/conflicting information sources
• relative importance of the scene

Abstract
People process utterances incrementally, often anticipating arguments in advance of actually hearing those arguments. The
presence of a visual scene during spoken sentence comprehension has enabled researchers to study the circumstances under
which this type of anticipatory behavior occurs and explore
the influence of the scene itself. Such “visual world” studies
have revealed much about the interaction of various information sources and the time course of their influence on comprehension. In the current study, five experiments that trade off
scene context with a variety of linguistic factors are modelled
with a Simple Recurrent Network that has been modified to
integrate a scene representation with the standard incremental input of a sentence. The results show that the model captures the qualitative behavior observed during the experiments,
while retaining the ability to develop the correct interpretation
in the absence of visual input.

Introduction
It is widely accepted in the psycholinguistics community that
sentence processing is incremental. There is growing evidence from recent eye-tracking experiments demonstrating
that anticipation also plays an important role in how people interpret sentences. These observations naturally lead to
questions about the factors underlying this behavior. That is,
what kinds of information does the sentence processor rely on
to construct intepretations incrementally and hypothesize expected continuations, and what is the time course of such processes? The richness of language and the context in which it
occurs provide many relevant information sources, including
morphosyntactic and lexical information, world knowledge,
as well as information from the immediate visual context.
Language is naturally situated. People learn their native
tongue within the context of the world around them, and they
use language to make reference to objects in that world, as
well as relationships among those objects (e.g., Gleitman,
1990). Given the relevance of the visual context, a natural
question to ask is how language processing interacts with
non-linguistic input such as a scene. Research within the
visual worlds paradigm has already begun to offer insights
into this question that were not possible with more traditional
approaches such as reading studies that relied on processing
load to track how people comprehend language. In the visual worlds paradigm, research has shown that people’s attention to objects in a scene closely tracks their mention in
a spoken sentence, and that the visual scene itself can influence the interpretation of linguistic input (Tanenhaus et al.,
1995). Furthermore, referential contrast among objects in
a scene can, for example, facilitate object identification in
structurally unambiguous sentences with temporary referential ambiguity (Sedivy et al., 1999). World knowledge, too,

In the first simulation, we sought to simultaneously model
four experiments that featured revealing contrasts. These four
experiments show that the human sentence processor is extremely adept at utilizing all available sources of information
to rapidly interpret language. In particular, information from
visual context can readily be integrated with linguistic and
world knowledge to disambiguate argument roles where the
information from the auditory stream is insufficient in itself.

All experiments were conducted in German, a language
that allows both subject-verb-object (SVO) and object-verbsubject (OVS) sentence types, so that word order cannot be
reliably used to determine role assignments. Rather, case
marking in German is used to indicate grammatical function
such as subject or object, except in the case of feminine and
neuter nouns where the article does not carry any distinguishing marking for the nominative and accusative cases.

Anticipation in ambiguous sentences

Anticipation in unambiguous sentences
The first two experiments modelled involved unambiguous
sentences in which case-marking and verb selectional restrictions in the linguistic input, together with depicted characters
in a visual scene, allowed rapid assignment of the roles played
by those characters.
Experiment 1: Morphosyntactic and lexical verb information. Kamide et al. (2003) presented subjects with a scene
showing, for example, a hare, a cabbage, a fox, and a distractor (see Figure 1) together with either a spoken German SVO
sentence (1) or with an OVS sentence (2):
(1) Der Hase frisst gleich den Kohl.
The harenom eats shortly the cabbageacc .
(2) Den Hasen frisst gleich der Fuchs.
The hareacc eats shortly the foxnom .
The subject and object case-marking on the article of the first
noun phrase together with verb meaning and world knowledge allowed anticipation of the correct post-verbal referent.
People made anticipatory eye-movements to the cabbage after hearing “The hare (subj) eats ...” and to the after “The hare
(obj) eats ...”. Thus, when the utterance is unambiguous, and
linguistic/world knowledge restricts the domain of potential
referents in a scene, the comprehension system may predict
mention of post-verbal referents.
Experiment 2: Verb type information. To further investigate the role of verb information, the authors used the
same visual scenes in a follow-up study, but replaced the
agent/patient verbs like frisst (“eats”) with experiencer/theme
verbs like interessiert (“interests”). The agent/experiencer
and patient/theme roles from Experiment 1 were swapped.
Given the same scene in Figure 1 but the subject-first sentence
(3) or object-first sentence (4), participants showed gaze fixations complementary to those in the first experiment, confirming that both syntactic case information and semantic verb
information are used to predict subsequent referents.

The second set of experiments investigated temporarily ambiguous German sentences. Findings showed that depicted
events–just like world and linguistic knowledge in unambiguous sentences–can establish a scene character’s role as agent
or patient in the face of linguistic structural ambiguity.
Experiment 3: Verb-mediated depicted role relations.
Knoeferle et al. (2005) investigated comprehension of spoken
sentences with local structural and thematic role ambiguity.
An example of the German SVO/OVS ambiguity is the SVO
sentence (5) versus the OVS sentence (6):
(5) Die Princessin malt offensichtlich den Fechter.
The princessnom paints obviously the fenceracc .
(6) Die Princessin wäscht offensichtlich der Pirat.
The princessacc washes obviously the piratenom .
Together with the auditorily presented sentence a scene was
shown in which a princess both paints a fencer and is washed
by a pirate (see Figure 2). Linguistic disambiguation occurred
on the second noun phrase (NP); in the absence of stereotypical verb-argument relationships, disambiguation prior to
the second NP was only possible through use of the depicted
events and their associated depicted role relations. When the
verb identified an action, the depicted role relations disambiguated towards either an SVO agent-patient (5) or OVS
patient-agent role (6) relation, as indicated by anticipatory
eye-movements to the patient (pirate) or agent (fencer), respectively, for (5) and (6). This gaze-pattern showed the rapid
influence of verb-mediated depicted events on the assignment
of a thematic role to a temporarily ambiguous sentence-initial
noun phrase.
Experiment 4: Soft temporal adverb constraint. Knoeferle et al. also investigated German verb-final active/passive
constructions. In both the active future-tense (7) and the
passive sentence (8), the initial subject noun phrase is roleambiguous, and the auxiliary wird can have a passive or future interpretation.
(7) Die Princessin wird sogleich den Pirat washen.
The princessnom will right away wash the pirateacc .
(8) Die Princessin wird soeben von dem Fechter gemalt.
The princessacc was just now painted by the fencernom .

To evoke early linguistic disambiguation, temporal adverbs
biased the auxiliary wird toward either the future (“will”)
or passive (“is -ed”) reading. Since the verb was sentencefinal, the interplay of scene and linguistic cues (e.g., temporal adverbs) were rather more subtle. When the listener
heard a future-biased adverb such as sogleich, after the auxiliary wird, he interpreted the initial NP as an agent of a future
construction, as evidenced by anticipatory eye-movements to
the patient in the scene. Conversely, listeners interpreted the
passive-biased construction with these roles exchanged.
event layers

Architecture
Neural networks are a natural choice for modelling multiple modality eye-tracking experiments such as those just described because seamless integration of disparate information
sources has long been a hallmark of these types of architectures, due to their operation through the soft constraints of
computation over weights between numerous interconnected
units employing simple summation and compression.
The Simple Recurrent Network is a type of neural network
that allows the processing of temporal sequences of patterns
like words in a sentence. The modeller trains the network
on prespecified targets, such as verbs and their arguments,
that represent what the network is expected to produce upon
completing a sentence. Processing is incremental, with each
new input word interpreted in the context of the sentence processed so far, represented by a copy of the previous hidden
layer serving as additional input to the current hidden layer.
Because these types of associationist models automatically
develop correlations among the data they are trained on, they
will typically develop expectations about the output even before processing is completed. Moreover, during the course
of processing a sentence these expectations can be overridden with subsequent input, often abruptly revising an interpretation in a manner reminiscent of how humans seem to
process language. Indeed, it is these characteristics of incremental processing, the automatic development of expectations, seamless integration of multiple sources of information, and nonmonotonic revision that have endeared neural
network models to cognitive researchers.
In this study, the four experiments described above have
been modelled simultaneously using the same network. The
goal of modelling all experimental results by a single architecture required enhancements to the SRN, the development
and presentation of the training data, as well as the training
regime itself. These will be described in turn below.
In two of the experiments, only three characters are depicted, representation of which can be propagated directly to
the network’s hidden layer. In the other two experiments,
the scene featured three characters involved in two events
(e.g., pirate-washes-princess and princess-paints-fencer,
as shown in Figure 3). The middle character was involved
in both events, either as an agent or a patient (e.g., princess).
Only one of the events, however, corresponded to the spoken
linguistic input.
The most important modification to the SRN involved the
representation of this scene information and integration into
the model’s processing (see Figure 3). The encoding of the
scene was complicated by the need to represent the depicted
events, which involved actions, in addition to just the charac-

ters themselves in the scene. Accordingly, the model has links
from the characters to the hidden layer, links from the characters and depicted actions to event layers, and links from
these event layers to the hidden layer of the SRN. Representations for the events were developed in the event layers by
compressing the scene representations of the involved characters and depicted actions through weights corresponding to
the action, the agent of the action, and the patient of the action. This event representation was kept simple to provide
conceptual input to the hidden layer, divorced from the linguistic information the network was to learn from the sentence input. That is, who did what to whom was encoded
for the events, when depicted; grammatical information came
from the linguistic input.
Neural networks will usually encode any correlations in the
data that help to minimize error. In order to prevent the network from encoding regularities in its weights regarding the
position of the characters and events given in the scene (such
as, for example, that the central character in the scene corresponds to the first NP in the presented sentence) which are
not relevant to the role-assignment task, one set of weights
was used for all characters, and another set of weights used
for both events. This weight-sharing ensured that the network
had to access the information encoded in the event layers, or
determine the relevant characters itself, thus improving generalization. The representations for the characters and actions
were the same for both input (scene and sentence) and output.
The SRN consisted of input and output assemblies of 100
units each. The input assemblies were the scene representations and the current word from the input sentence. The
output assemblies were the verb, the first and second nouns,
and an assembly that indicated whether the first noun was the
agent or patient of the sentence. Typically, agent and patient
assemblies would be fixed in a case-role representation without such a discriminator, and the model required to learn to
instantiate them correctly (Miikkulainen, 1997), but we found

1439

that the model performed much better when the task was recast as having to learn to isolate the nouns in the order in
which they are introduced, and separately mark how those
nouns relate to the verb. The hidden and context layers consisted of 400 units. The network was initialized with weights
between -0.01 and 0.01.

Input Data, Training, and Experiments
The network had to be trained to correctly handle sentences
involving non-stereotypical events as well as stereotypical
ones, both when visual context was present and absent. To
this end, we adopted a grammar-based approach to exhaustively generate a set of sentences based on the experimental
materials while holding out the actual materials to be used
for testing. In order to accurately model the first two experiments involving selectional restrictions on verbs, two additional words were added to the lexicon for each character selected by a verb. For example, in the sentence Der Hase frisst
gleich den Kohl, the nouns Hase1, Hase2, Kohl1, and Kohl21
were used to develop training sentences so that the network
could learn that Hase, frisst, and Kohl were correlated without ever encountering all three words in the same training
sentence. The experiments involving non-stereotypicality did
not pose this constraint, so training sentences were generated
simply to avoid presenting experimental items.
Some standard simplifications to the words have been
made to facilitate modelling. For example, multi-word adverbs such as fast immer are treated as one word through
hyphenation so that sentence length within a given experimental set up is maintained. Nominal case markings such
as the final -n in Hasen are removed to avoid an unnecessary sparse data problem as these markings are idiosyncratic,
and the case markings on the determiners are more informative overall. More importantly, morphemes such as the infinitive marker -en and past participle ge- are treated as separate
words, again to avoid the sparse data problem, where, for example, the verb forms malt, malen, and gemalt, would all be
treated as unrelated tokens. All 326 words in the lexicon for
the first four experiments were given random representations.
Training the network involved repeatedly presenting the
model with 1000 randomly generated sentences from each experiment (constituting one epoch) and testing every 10 epochs
against the held-out test materials for each of the five experiments. Half the sentences were trained with scenes and half
were trained without in order to approximate linguistic experience. The learning rate was initially set to 0.05 and gradually reduced to 0.002 over the course of 10000 epochs. Ten
splits were run on 1.6Ghz PCs and took approximately two
weeks to complete.

and combine it with the incrementally presented sentence to
anticipate forthcoming arguments.
For the two experiments (1 and 2) using stereotypical information, the network achieved just over 96% at sentence end,
and anticipation accuracy was just over 95% at the adverb.
Analysis shows that the network makes errors in token identification, confusing words that are within the selectionally restricted set, such as, for example, Kohl and Kohl2. Thus, the
model has not quite mastered the stereotypical knowledge,
particularly as it relates to the presence of the scene.
For the other two experiments using non-stereotypical
characters and depicted events (experiments 3 and 4), accuracy was 100% at the end of the sentence. More importantly,
the model achieved over 98% early disambiguation on experiment 3, where the sentences were simple, active SVO
and OVS. Early disambiguation on experiment 4 was somewhat harder because the adverb is the disambiguating point
in the sentence as opposed to the verb in the other three experiments. As nonlinear dynamical systems, neural networks
sometimes require an extra step to settle after a decision point
is reached due to the attractor dynamics of the weights.
On closer inspection of the model’s behavior during processing, it is apparent that the event layers provide enough
additional information beyond that encoded in the weights
between the characters and the hidden layer that the model
is able to make finer discriminations in experiments 3 and 4,
enhancing its performance.

Figure 4 reports the percentage of targets at the network’s output layer the model correctly matches, both as measured at
the adverb and at the end of the sentence. The model clearly
demonstrates the qualitative behavior observed in all four experiments in that it is able to access the scene information

Simulation 2
In this section, we present preliminary results from modelling a more challenging experiment that examines how nonstereotypical depicted events interact with stereotypicality in
the form of (internal) world knowledge to influence incremental thematic interpretation.
Coordinated Interplay Account. Based on the findings
from the four experiments in Simulation 1, Knoeferle and
Crocker (2004b) presented a study that examined two issues.
First, it replicated the finding that stored knowledge about
events that were not depicted and information from depicted,
but non-stereotypical, events each enable rapid thematic interpretation. An example scene showed a wizard, a pilot, and
a detective serving food (see Figure 5). Item sentences had
an object-verb-subject order. When people heard (9), casemarking on the first NP identified the pilot as a patient. The
subsequent verb uniquely identified the detective as the only
food-serving agent, revealed by more inspections to the agent

(see the General Discussion). We found a small range of frequencies that permitted the network to develop an early reliance on the information from the scene while it gradually
learned the stereotypical associations. The training corpus
was generated by exhaustively combining participants and actions while holding out all test sentences. The network was
trained both with and without scenes.
The experiment was modelled with the same basic architecture as described in Simulation 1 with some minor modifications: only the event-to-hidden layer links were used for
scene integration and weight updates were roughly five times
stronger. Neither change is expected to adversely affect the
previous results when experiments from simulation 1 are integrated with simulation 2 in future work.
Early results from five separate runs with slightly different
training parameters (e.g., learning rate and stereotypicality ratio) show that the network does indeed model the observed
experimental behavior. The best results thus far exceed 99%
accuracy in correctly anticipating the proper roles and 100%
accuracy at the end of sentence.

of the depicted event (detective) than to the other agent. In
contrast, when people heard the verb in sentence (10), stereotypical knowledge about agents identified the wizard as the
only relevant agent, as indicated by a higher proportion of anticipatory eye-movements to the stereotypical agent (wizard)
than to the other agent.
(9) Den Piloten verköstigt gleich der Detektiv.
The pilotacc serves-food-to shortly the detectivenom .
(10) Den Piloten verzaubert gleich der Zauberer.

Second, the study determined the relative importance of depicted events and verb-based thematic role knowledge. Participants heard utterances (11 & 12) where the verb identified
both a stereotypical (detective) or a depicted agent (wizard).
When faced with this conflict, people preferred to rely on
the immediate event depictions over stereotypical knowledge,
and looked more often at the wizard, the agent in the depicted
event, than at the other, stereotypical agent of a spying-action
(the detective).

General Discussion and Future Work

Architecture, Data, Training, and Results

Experiments in the visual worlds paradigm have clearly reinforced the view of language comprehension as an active,
incremental, highly integrative process in which anticipation
of upcoming arguments plays a crucial role. Visual context
not only facilitates identification of likely referents in a sentence, but helps establish relationships between referents and
the roles they may fill. Research thus far has shown that
the human sentence processor seems to have facile access to
whatever relevant information is available, whether it be syntactic, lexical, semantic, or visual, and that it can combine
these sources to achieve as complete an interpretation as is
possible at any given point in comprehending a sentence.
The modelling results reported in this paper are an important step toward the goal of understanding how the human
sentence processor is able to accomplish these feats. The
SRN provides a natural framework for this research because
its operation is premised on incremental and integrative processing. Trained simply to produce a representation of the
complete interpretation of a sentence as each new word is
processed (on the view that people learn to process language
by reviewing what they hear), the model automatically develops anticipations for upcoming arguments that allow it to
demonstrate the early disambiguation behavior observed in
the visual worlds experiments modelled here.
The simple accuracy results belie the complexity of the
task in both simulations. In Simulation 1, the network has to
demonstrate early disambiguation when the scene is present,
showing that it can indeed access the proper role and filler
from the compressed representation of the event associated
with the first NP and verb processed in the linguistic stream.
This task is rendered more difficult because the proper event
must be extracted from the superimposition of the two events
in the scene, which is what is propagated into the model’s
hidden layer. In addition, it must also still be able to process
all sentences correctly when the scene is not present.
Simulation 2 is more challenging still. The experiment
shows that scene information takes precedence when there
is a conflict with stereotypical knowledge; otherwise, each

In simulation 1, we modelled experiments that depended on
stereotypicality or depicted events, but not both. The experiment modelled in simulation 2, however, was specifically designed to investigate how these two information sources interacted. Accordingly, the network needed to learn to use either
information from the scene or stereotypicality when available, and, moreover, favor the scene when the two sources
conflicted, as observed in the empirical results. Recall that
the network is trained only on the final interpretation of a
sentence. Thus, capturing the observed behavior required manipulation of the frequencies of the four conditions described
above during training. In order to train the network to develop stereotypical agents for verbs, the frequency that a verb
occurs with its stereotypical agent, such as Detektiv and bespitzelt from example (12) above, had to be greater than for a
non-stereotypical agent. However, the frequency should not
be so great that it overrode the influence from the scene.
The solution adopted in this study is motivated by a theory of language acquisition that takes into account the importance of early linguistic experience in a visual environment
1441

cessing behavior when context is absent. Furthermore, more
recent results show that training the network in a visual environment, with stereotypical knowledge gradually learned and
reinforced, allows the model to successfully negotiate even
conflicting information sources.

source of knowledge is used when it is available. In the training regime used in this simulation, the dominance of the scene
is established early because it is much more immediate than
stereotypical knowledge. As training progresses, stereotypical knowledge is gradually learned because it is sufficiently
frequent for the network to capture the relevant associations.
As the network weights gradually saturate, it becomes more
difficult to retune them. But encoding stereotypical knowledge requires far fewer weight adjustments, so the network is
able to learn that task later during training.
Knoeferle and Crocker (2004a,b) suggest that the preferred
reliance of the comprehension system on the visual context
over stored knowledge can broadly be accomodated by appealing to boot-strapping accounts of language acquisition
such as that of Gleitman (1990). Gleitman suggests that partial interpretation of a sentence can direct the child’s attention
to relevant entities and events in the environment. A child can
in turn extract event structure from the world around it. Indeed, the rapid impact of the immediate situation identifies
the comprehension system to be highly adapted towards acquiring new information from its environment. The fact that
the child can draw on two informational sources (sentence
and scene) enables it to infer information that it has not yet
acquired from what it already knows.
Knoeferle and Crocker (2004a) argue that the substantial
part of our lives we have spent acquiring language may have
shaped both our cognitive architecture (i.e., providing for
rapid, seamless integration of scene and linguistic information), and comprehension mechanisms (e.g., people rapidly
avail themselves of information from the immediate scene
when the utterance identifies it).
Connectionist models such as the SRN have been used to
model aspects of cognitive development, including the timing of emergent behaviors (Elman et al., 1996), making them
highly suitable for simulating developmental stages in child
language acquisition (e.g., first learning names of objects in
the immediate scene, and later proceeding to the acquisition
of stereotypical knowledge). If there are developmental reasons for the preferred reliance of listeners on the immediate scene during language comprehension, then the finding
that modelling that development provides the most efficient
(if not only) way to naturally reproduce the observed experimental behavior promises to offer deeper insight into how
such knowledge is instilled in the brain.
Future research will focus on combining all of the experiments in one model, and expand the range of sentence types
and fillers to which the network is exposed. The architecture
itself is being redesigned to scale up to much more complex
linguistic constructions and have greater coverage while retaining the cognitively plausible behavior described in this
study (Mayberry and Crocker, 2004).

Conclusion
We have presented a neural network architecture that successfully models the results of five recent experiments designed to
study the interaction of visual context with sentence processing. The model shows that it can adaptively use information
from the visual scene such as depicted events, when present,
to anticipate roles and fillers as observed in each of the experiments, as well as demonstrate traditional incremental pro1442
