to the constraint that, though each compound had two
interpretations (one from each author), each compound
could only appear once in the materials. The 60 exper-

of 382 compound and interpretation pairs. There were
three factors in the experiment, which we omit here for
brevity. Each participant saw half of the experimental
items.
