the novel compound, the greater the likelihood that the
novel compound will adopt its meaning. The reasons for
this prediction basically hinge on the fact that the plausibility constraint promotes new meanings for the novel
compound that semantically overlap with already-known
meanings. The models also have the added benefit that
they can explain the interpretation of property and relational compounds.

Problems Description
Our constraint models do not see relational similarity
as the main driver of meaning generation from known
compounds, but they rather see similarity as the key
factor. Unfortunately, Gagné’s (2001, 2002) priming evidence does not decide between these two accounts. In
the present experiments, we try to separate the two factors by holding relational similarity constant while varying the similarity of the constituents; more specifically,
the modifiers of the novel and known compounds. Also,
her studies are limited to the examination of similarity effects on relational compounds only. In this study,
we examine similarity priming effects for relational and
property compounds (see Experiment 1 and 2).
However, there is a problem with similarity. Gagné
(2001, 2002) controlled similarity with a ‘subjective’ rating study carried out by a small number of participants.
The main problem when one relies on consensual ratings
is that they may well reflect other variables (e.g., sensicality). Therefore, we had to use an ‘objective’, computational measure of similarity. Unfortunately, computational measures are far from perfect and can be subject to problems (e.g., dependance on heuristic methods
that ignore the rich world knowledge humans possess or
emerging properties and relations when concepts combine). Hence, we had also to validate the objective measure with a subjective measure (see Rating Study). We
use a combination of the two measures to develop materials to test in our two experiments. Experiment 1 uses a
sensicality judgement task in conjunction with our priming paradigm. Experiment 2 replicates the first experiment using a comprehension task instead of a sensicality
judgements.

Semantic Similarity Modelling
To properly characterize the similarity between novel
and known compounds in our subsequent experiments we
adapted a model that uses WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
WordNet is one of the most influential computational
lexical resources and very well suited for similarity measures, since it organizes nouns and verbs into hierarchies
based on is-a hypernymy relations. One way to compute
similarity between two concepts is to use the information
content of the least common subsumer of the two concepts compared and the information content of the two
concepts themselves. Information content is a measure
of the specificity of a concept. Seco, Veale, and Hayes
(2004) have developed a method for defining information
content that does not require any resources other than
WordNet. The main guiding assumption for computing
information content values is that concepts with many

2135

hyponyms are less informative than concepts with fewer
hyponyms. The semantic similarity formulation is:
sim(c1 , c2 ) = 1−

icwn (c1 ) + icwn (c2 ) − 2 ∗ simres (c1 , c2 )
2

where c1 and c2 are the two concepts compared, icwn (c1 )
and icwn (c2 ) are the information content values expressed as functions of the hyponyms each of them
has, and simres corresponds to Resnik’s (1995) similarity function that accommodates the information content
values. The formula is linearly normalized to constrain
the output to values between 0 and 1 (for details, see
Seco, Veale and Hayes, 2004).
A preliminary evaluation they conducted showed that
this metric correlated highly with some existing similarity ratings gathered from people (N = 30, ρ = .84, p <
.001) and performed better than previous WordNetbased similarity models. We adopted a simple approach
to extending this formula to compounds. For each compound it was assumed that its modifier and head noun
as such are equally important for determining similarity.
The similarity between the two modifiers and the two
heads was computed separately, the scores were divided
by two (to constrain the output to values between 0 and
1) and were added up. Formally, this can be expressed
as:
sim0 (cc1 , cc2 ) =

sim(mcc1 , mcc2 ) sim(hcc1 , hcc2 )
+

Rating Study: Compounds Similarity
To empirically validate the objective similarity scores derived from the model, a rating study was carried out
to determine the degree of correspondence between the
model scores and people’s similarity ratings for the same
items.

Method
Materials Forty-six noun-noun combinations were selected from the WordNet knowledge base to be used as
familiar primes. These combinations were judged to be
familiar by the authors. Additionally, all the combinations were found to be present in the British National
Corpus (BNC; Burnard, 1995). Half of these compounds
were relational, half property compounds. Two versions
of each of these prime compounds were created: one with
a common head and a similar modifier (e.g., coal tank to
the original gas tank), and one with a common head and
a dissimilar modifier (e.g., sand tank to the original gas
tank). Operationally, similar modifiers were defined as
pairs of concepts with a similarity score of 0.25 or higher.
Dissimilar modifiers were defined as pairs of concepts
with a similarity score lower than 0.25. Given that the
common head creates a base similarity score of 0.50, as
a whole the similar compounds had a score of equal to
or greater than 0.75, and the dissimilar compounds had
a score of lower than 0.75. Thus, we had 3 sets of 46
compounds: 46 primes, 46 similar compounds to these
primes, and 46 dissimilar compounds to the primes.
These similar and dissimilar target compounds also
met several other constraints: (i) they were judged as

sensible combinations by the authors and two independent judges (i.e., compounds for which a ready meaning
could be found), (ii) they were verified to be novel by
not occurring at all in the BNC, (iii) for relational compounds, it was established that they could be interpreted
using the same relation as the prime and that this relation occurred with the same frequency in the different
compounds (to control for Gagné and Shoben’s, 1997, relational frequency effect); this was carried out by querying the BNC with all the concepts in the compound. A
large sample of sequences (50 noun-noun sequences from
the BNC written corpus and 50 from the BNC spoken
corpus, when available) involving each concept were extracted, from which associated relations were identified
and counted, (iv) the frequency of modifiers of the relational and property compounds was not reliably different in the set of similar targets (MR = 26.04, MP =
20.96; Mann-Whitney U = 206, p = .20, 2 − tailed) and
dissimilar targets (MR = 25.91, MP = 21.09; MannWhitney U = 209, p = .22, 2−tailed), and (v) it was verified that there was not a reliable difference between the
frequency of modifiers in the two target sets (Wilcoxon’s
matched pairs signed ranks test, Z = −.44, p = .66, 2 −
tailed).
Subjects Thirty-five English-speaking, undergraduate
students from UCD volunteered to participate in the
study.
Procedure The rating study was done via a web interface on a PC. Ninety-two pairs of one prime and one
target compound were presented on the screen after the
instructions and 2 examples. Below them was a similarity rating scale running from 1 (Very Dissimilar) to 7
(Very Similar) (radio boxes). Participants were asked to
rate how similar or dissimilar each target compound is
to its prime. They were told that they should not base
their judgements on how sensible or familiar they find
any of the compounds. Compound pairs were presented
in a random order, one by one. The rating took about
10 minutes to complete.

Analysis, Results and Discussion
The ratings were treated as raw scores and as categories.
For the latter, the mean ratings for a given pair of compounds and the number of people who judged it as similar, dissimilar or neutral were found. If the mean similarity rating was < 4 and most people deemed it to be
dissimilar it was classified as dissimilar; if it was rated
> 4 by most people it was classified as similar.
Overall, there was a close agreement between the similarity scores derived from WordNet and the ratings given
by people. The agreement between the consensual and
model classifications was roughly 90%. Participants classified 42 of the 46 model-defined similar compound pairs
as similar (M = 4.99, SD = .67), and 41 of the 46
model-defined dissimilar pairs as dissimilar (M = 3.37,
SD = .50). The remaining compounds were differentially classified.
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated between the WordNet-based similarity scores and the pro-

2136

portions of people rating an item as similar/dissimilar.
The correlation was strong in the tests; the higher the
score, the higher the similarity rankings (N = 92, r =
.66, p < .001); the lower the score, the higher the dissimilarity rankings (N = 92, r = −.63, p < .001). A reliable correlation was also found between the mean ratings
and the model scores (N = 92, r = .63, p < .001). This
empirical substantiation of the similarity metric derived
from WordNet provides us with some extra comfort for
its use in the experiments that follow.

Experiment 1: Similarity and Sensicality
We have already seen that previous work has shown that
known compounds can prime interpretations of novel
compounds (Gagné, 2001, 2002). However, this work
did not provide a clear basis for similarity or distinguish
it from relational similarity. Neither did it address the
property compounds, as it was solely directed at relational ones. In the present experiment, we re-examine
these priming results holding relational similarity constant and systematically varying similarity. We also
widened the net to handle property compounds and relational compounds in a single study. A sensicality judgement task, where people were asked to decide quickly
how sensible they find a particular compound, was used
to tap people’s understanding of novel compounds.
Our expectation was that the similar to the primes
compounds would be judged sensible faster than the dissimilar to the primes compounds. On the compound
type dimension (property/relational), Gagné (2000) predicts that relational compounds should be judged faster
than property compounds because they are considered
more ‘natural’. Notably, Tagalakis and Keane (2003)
have not found consistent evidence for this expectation.

Method
Materials Thirty-eight familiar compounds from the
rating study were used as primes, 19 of which were property compounds and 19 relational compounds. The novel
targets were 38 matching compounds with a common
head and a similar modifier (as defined above), and 38
matching compounds with a common head and a dissimilar modifier (as defined above). Thirty-eight filler compounds were also used. They were noun combinations
with no obvious interpretations, with common heads to
the prime and target compounds, and modifiers with
zero similarity scores to the prime and target modifiers.
The target compounds met several constraints: (i)
none of them was compound on which people’s classification differed from the model classification, (ii) there was
no reliable variance of similarity between the property
and relational compounds in the two target sets according to the people’s ratings (F (1, 72) = 1.07, p = .31)
and the model’s scores (F (1, 72) = .68, p = .41), (iii)
there was a significant variance between the two sets
of target items regarding their degree of similarity with
the human (F (1, 72) = 135.02, p < .001) and model
(F (1, 72) = 176.83, p < .001) metrics, (iv) there was
no reliable variance in word length, (v) the frequency
of modifiers of the relational and property compounds

was not reliably different in the set of similar targets
(MR = 22.00, MP = 17.00; Mann-Whitney U = 133, p =
.17, 2−tailed) and dissimilar targets (MR = 21.74, MP =
17.26; Mann-Whitney U = 138, p = .22, 2 − tailed),
(vi) only 3 modifiers had also an adjective sense (2 in
the set of similar targets and 1 in the set of dissimilar
targets), and (vi) there was not a reliable variance between the frequency of modifiers in the two target sets,
as a Wilcoxon’s matched pairs signed ranks test showed
(Z = −.33, p = .74, 2 − tailed).
Subjects Thirty-four English-speaking, undergraduate students from UCD participated in this experiment
for partial course credit.
Procedure There were two parts to the experiment.
First, participants were asked to study a simple compound and type in its meaning; the familiar primes were
presented during this part. Second, when they had completed interpreting the familiar primes, they were presented with a new set of compounds, the novel ones,
and asked to judge whether they were sensible or not.
The appropriate instructions were presented prior to
both parts. In the interpretation task, they were instructed to read each combination carefully before typing in an interpretation. Participants placed the index
finger of their predominant hand on a function key of
the keyboard (“/” for the right-handed; “\” for the lefthanded). When they were ready, they pressed the function key once. The phrase they were being asked to read
was displayed immediately in the middle of the screen.
Once they had read and understood the word pair, they
pressed the function key, typed in the interpretation, and
pressed the function key again to continue with the next
compound. In the sensicality judgement task, participants were asked to read the compounds presented on
the following screens and indicate whether they was sensible or non-sensible as accurately and quickly as possible. They pressed one of two keys to indicate whether
they thought the item to be sense or nonsense. For half
of the participants, the J key corresponded to “sense”
and F key to “nonsense”. For the other half, the meaning of the keys were reversed. The response time from
presentation of the compounds to pressing the key in
judgement was measured. In between all trials the word
“Ready?” appeared first on the screen and proceeded by
pressing the space bar once. There was a practice session for each part. Stimulus order was randomized for
each participant and with each session lasting about 30
minutes.

Analysis, Results and Discussion
The data of 6 participants with error rates greater than
33% were excluded from the analyses. Trials greater
than 3SDs from each of the remaining participants’
grand mean (N = 44) were also excluded.
Response Times A two-factor, repeated measures
ANOVA for the variables of similarity (similar or dissimilar) and compound type (property or relational) was
carried out on the response times to the targets judged
as sensible. Analyses were carried out by-subjects and

2137

by-items using the General Linear Model procedure. In
the by-subjects analysis (F1 ), similarity and compound
type were treated as fixed factors, whereas subjects was
the random factor. For the by-items analysis (F2 ), the
items nested within the similarity and compound type
conditions was the random factor.
A reliable main effect of similarity was found, with
the similar compounds (M = 1703.67, SD = 757.02)
being judged more quickly to be sensible than the dissimilar compounds (M = 1881.65, SD = 1002.46),
(F1 (1, 27) = 19.61, p < .001; F2 (1, 77) = 10.08, p =
.002). There was no reliable difference between relational
(M = 1794.18, SD = 802.32) and property compounds
(M = 1773.48, SD = 965.91), (F1 (1, 27) = .34, p = .56;
F2 (1, 77) = .03, p = .87), and no reliable interaction
between the two factors (F1 (1, 27) = 1.87, p = .18;
F2 (1, 77) = .09, p = .77). The means and standard deviations for the four conditions were as follows: property similar, M = 1687.93, SD = 809.96; property dissimilar, M = 1886.48, SD = 1131.27; relational similar, M = 1718.30, SD = 704.89; relational dissimilar,
M = 1877.90, SD = 891.14. The correlation between response times and model metrics was moderately negative
(N = 76, r = −.32, p = .005); the higher the similarity
between the prime and target, the less time was needed
to understand the target.
Taking these analyses together, it is quite clear that
modifier similarity has a marked effect on the ease with
which people can make sense judgements of novel compounds. There is no evidence to suggest that relational
compounds are judged as sensible faster than property
compounds.
Proportions of Sense Judgements Typically, in
these priming experiments, all response times analyses
are based on correct responses only with incorrect responses being dropped (e.g., judging a sensible compound to be non-sensible). Under these conditions, the
pattern of proportions accepted can also be informative
about participants comprehension of the compounds.
Data based on the proportions of times a compound was
correctly judged to be sensible was analyzed using a twoway, repeated measures ANOVA for the factors of similarity and compound type. In the by-subjects analysis,
the dependent variable was the proportion of combinations that a participant judged to be sensible in each condition. In the by-items analysis, the dependent variable
was the proportion of occasions that each combination
was judged to be sensible.
This analysis revealed a main effect of similarity,
with the similar compounds (M = 75.47, SD = 12.60)
being judged sensible more often than the dissimilar
compounds (M = 62.97, SD = 14.77), (F1 (1, 27) =
39.02, p < .001; F2 (1, 72) = 18.93, p < .001). There
was also a main effect of compound type with the relational compounds (M = 74.53, SD = 13.34) being
judged sensible more often than the property compounds
(M = 63.91, SD = 14.87), (F1 (1, 27) = 10.91, p = .003;
F2 (1, 72) = 13.66, p < .001). There was also a reliable interaction between compound type and similarity
in the by-participants test (F1 (1, 27) = 9.32, p = .005;

F2 (1, 72) = 3.24, p = .08). The means and standard deviations for the four conditions were as follows: property similar, M = 72.74, SD = 12.09; property dissimilar, M = 55.08, SD = 11.98; relational similar,
M = 78.20, SD = 12.82; relational dissimilar, M =
70.86, SD = 13.16. The correlation between proportions
of sense judgements and model metrics was moderately
positive (N = 76, r = .39, p = .001).
These results clearly demonstrate that similar compounds are more often judged to be sensible than dissimilar ones, which is consistent with the response time
results. However, the analyses also give some evidence
that relational compounds, particularly dissimilar ones,
are more often considered to be sensible than their property compound counterparts. This can be a general matter of difficulty people have with property compounds
(Gagné, 2000) or be due to the fact that speeded responses are sensitive to the higher distribution of relational compounds in language (see, e.g., Levi, 1978).
These are questions that we try to answer in the next experiment and, at the same time, we examine once more
the similarity effects using a comprehension task rather
than a sensicality judgement task.

Experiment 2: Similarity and
Comprehension
Method
Materials The stimuli were identical with those of Experiment 1.
Subjects Thirty English-speaking, University College
Dublin, undergraduate students received partial course
credit for their participation in the experiment.
Procedure The experiment had two parts as in Experiment 1, the only difference being that in the second
part participants were asked to make a comprehension
judgement of the targets. Specifically, they read the presented compound on the screen, pressed a function key
when they had comprehended it - a condition added to
minimize the possibility that priming effects are purely
lexical, but are rather about the interpretation of compounds - and typed in the interpretation that first came
to mind before passing on to the next compound. The
response time was measured from the presentation of the
compound to the pressing of the function key. For those
compounds they could not comprehend, they typed in
the word “no” and continued to the next compound. The
order of stimuli was randomized for each participant and
each session took about 50 minutes to complete.

Analysis, Results and Discussion
The data of 4 participants with error rates greater than
33% were excluded from the analyses. Trials greater
than 3SDs from each of the remaining participants’
grand mean (N = 21) were also excluded. Two judges
analyzed participants’ interpretations of the compounds
(N = 1, 420) classifying them as relational, property or
“other” (minority interpretation types). Two dissimilar,
property compounds were relisted as relational because

2138

the majority of people interpreted them us such.
Response Times The analyses were conducted on
those trials in which participants comprehended the
compound and produced a property interpretation (N =
566) or a relational interpretation (N = 700). The
model specifications for the ANOVA tests were exactly
the same as those in Experiment 1.
A reliable main effect of similarity was found again,
with the similar compounds (M = 3481.29, SD =
1613.70) being comprehended more quickly than the
dissimilar compounds (M = 4287.00, SD = 1804.24),
(F1 (1, 26) = 36.70, p < .001; F2 (1, 651) = 24.68, p <
.001). There was no reliable difference between comprehension times for the relational (M = 3888.37, SD =
1748.47) and property compounds (M = 3767.89, SD =
1741.30), (F1 (1, 26) = 1.73, p = .20; F2 (1, 651) =
.77, p = .38), and no reliable interaction between the
two factors (F1 (1, 26) = .89, p = .35; F2 (1, 651) =
.68, p = .41). The means and standard deviations
for the four conditions were as follows: property similar M = 3382.14, SD = 1660.17; property dissimilar, M = 4348.21, SD = 1702.44; relational similar, M = 3572.16, SD = 1566.66; relational dissimilar, M = 4244.95, SD = 1872.36. The association between response times and model metrics was negative
(N = 76, r = −.62, p < .001). The results are consistent
with those of Experiment 1.
Proportions of Comprehension Judgements Following the same method used in Experiment 1, analyses of variance on the proportions of compounds comprehended were also conducted. A reliable main effect of similarity was observed, with the similar compounds (M = 79.05, SD = 14.60) being comprehended more often than the dissimilar compounds (M =
64.68, SD = 14.77), (F1 (1, 25) = 50.37, p < .001;
F2 (1, 72) = 18.14, p < .001). There was no reliable difference between the proportions of relational compounds
(M = 73.73, SD = 15.04) comprehended over property
ones (M = 69.67, SD = 17.59), (F1 (1, 25) = 1.75, p =
.20; F2 (1, 72) = .73, p = .40), neither was the interaction reliable (F1 (1, 25) = .16, p = .70; F2 (1, 72) =
1.25, p = .27). The means and standard deviations
for the four conditions were as follows: property similar, M = 79.57, SD = 13.88; property dissimilar, M =
61.34, SD = 16.24; relational similar, M = 78.67, SD =
15.42; relational dissimilar, M = 68.02, SD = 12.70.
A correlation between the proportions of comprehended
compounds and the model metrics was found to be moderately positive (N = 76, r = .34, p = .002).
Again, we see the same marked similarity effect found
in Experiment 1. However, the partial effects of compound type that were observed in the proportions of
sensicality judgments in Experiment 1 disappear when
people are asked to comprehend the compound targets
in this experiment. This observation is consistent with
Tagalakis and Keane’s (2003) study and their claim that
when people are making sensicality judgments they are
probably just developing a rough feel for whether or not
an interpretation is likely to be found.

General Discussion
In this study, we have provided evidence for how the understanding of novel compounds is facilitated by priming
from similar, known compounds. We replicated the results in two experiments using response time measures.
We have demonstrated that facilitating effects by priming occur for both relational and property compounds.
Unlike previous approaches that are based on a mixture
of distributional and semantic information of the concepts been involved, this research has focused on a well
understood and measured notion of similarity; namely,
that of semantic, taxonomic similarity. In this process,
an existing similarity model was extended and used to
evaluate our material. The model itself has been evaluated through a comparison with raters’ assessments and
experimental data, and was found to perform quite well.
Going on from here, future work could examine the
influence exerted by a known compound with a common
modifier and similar/dissimilar head to some novel one
(e.g., bullet car to the original bullet train), or examine the effects of a familiar prime on a novel target by
varying the degree of similarity between both their constituent concepts (e.g., rocket car to the original bullet
train). Also, given the differences reported between people’s sensicality and comprehension judgements of property versus relational compounds, it seems that an interesting follow up experiment to the present work would
be to compare understanding of novel compounds that
are primed by compounds that are similar/dissimilar to
these targets in terms of either relations or properties.
With regards to computational models of concept
combination, our findings suggest that those models providing mechanisms for producing relational and property
interpretations utilizing previous knowledge are on the
right track. For example, Lynott, Tagalakis, and Keane
(2004) argued that familiarity effects can be manifested
when people encounter a compound that is, while still
novel, nonetheless similar to some existing compound.
Tagalakis and Keane (2004) presented a case-based reasoning system that ‘comprehends’ compounds using information from previous cases and interpretation patterns encoded in its knowledge base, as well as semantic
structures and concept definitions provided by WordNet.
The incorporation of a direct measure of similarity, like
the one we have used here, can further improve its flexibility and efficiency. While semantic similarity of cannot provide a complete account of concept combination,
it does not always constitute a necessary or sufficient
condition, it is clear that it is a crucial factor that has
something very useful to offer in the development and
extension of cognitive and computational models.
