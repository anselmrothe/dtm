Existent research on intervention in learning suggests that,
perhaps not surprisingly, learning is promoted by the possibility to causally intervene with the system under study
(Klayman, 1988; Lagnado & Sloman, 2004). Advances in
the understanding and modeling of causal relations (Pearl,
2000) has stimulated renewed interest in cognitive science
for casual reasoning and its role for learning (Gopnik et al.,
2004; Rehder, 2003; Steyvers, Tenenbaum, Wagenmakers,
& Blum, 2003). Lagnado and Sloman (2004), for example,
used a trial by trial based learning paradigm in which participants obtained probabilistic data about a causal chain
either through observing sequences (e.g., seeing a high fuel
temperature and a low combustion chamber pressure leading
to the launch of a rocket) or through intervention (e.g., setting both temperature and pressure to either high or low and
then observing whether a rocket launched or failed). The
results showed a clear advantage for interveners in terms of
their ability to subsequently select the causal model likely to
have generated the data (from an array of possible models).
In this article we extend this finding by investigating the
role of intervention in multiple-cue judgment. In a multiplecue judgment task participants use a number of cues to infer
a criterion. Research with this task (Juslin, Jones, Olsson, &
Winman, 2003; Juslin, Olsson, & Olsson, 2003) has identified two qualitatively different cognitive processes that can
underlie performance in the standard observation training
regime. The first, inspired and motivated by research on
categorization, emphasizes exemplar memory and assumes
that people make judgments by retrieving similar exemplars
from memory (Medin & Schaffer, 1978; Nosofsky &
Johansen, 2000). The second, derived from research on multiple-cue judgment, stresses the controlled integration of
explicit knowledge of cue-criterion relations abstracted in
training (Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979).
In this context we investigate the relationship between active intervention and the cognitive representations acquired
and we will argue that the benefit of intervention should be
especially large if one engages in cue abstraction. Accordingly, one hypothesis in regard to why intervention affords a
benefit over observation is that it promotes knowledge representation in the form of abstract cue-criterion relations
rather than memory for exemplars (Juslin, Jones, et al, 2003;

Abstract
Previous studies suggest improved learning when participants
actively intervene rather than passively observe the stimuli in
a judgment task. In two experiments the authors investigate if
this improvement generalizes to multiple cue judgment tasks
where judgments may be formed from abstract knowledge of
cue-criterion relations or exemplar memory. More specific
hypotheses were that intervention in learning should improve
performance over observation, and that improvement should
be associated with a relative shift from exemplar memory to
cue abstraction. In contrast to previous studies, in a multiplecue judgment task with binary cues and continuous criterion,
there was poorer learning with intervention than observation,
and participants actively experimenting more produced poorer
judgments. The results suggest that intervention may distract
from efficient exemplar encoding and improvement may be
limited to tasks efficiently addressed by cue-abstraction.

Introduction
Information about our environment is acquired in a variety
of ways. We learn by instruction from others, by passive
observation, and by acting on our environment, observing
the consequences of our interventions. These methods of
acquiring information are all fundamental to our ability to
adapt and function successfully in the environment. In this
paper we examine the effects of different learning activities
in a multiple cue judgment task and, specifically, how these
activities relate to the cognitive representations that support
the judgment process. Will people’s knowledge of a judgment task differ depending on how they interact with stimuli
in training? The learning method used in numerous multiple
cue judgment and categorization tasks is observation, where
stimuli are presented; the participants make a judgment, and
receive outcome feedback. This method is relatively passive
and participants cannot interact with the stimuli and actively
test their own hypotheses. There is relatively little work
examining the role that intervention might have for learning
and how these effects relate to cognitive representations.
In the Western scientific tradition the advantage of experimentation over simple observation has long been recognized (Mill, 2002), but in the areas of categorization and
multiple-cue judgment, research on intervention is scarce.

Juslin, Olsson, et al., 2003). Because causal intervention
allows controlled observation, for example, by keeping all
cues but one constant to investigate its effect on the criterion, arguably it should become easier to abstract the relations between individual cues and the criterion. One prerequisite for this benefit from intervention is that people spontaneously engage in this sort of “experimentation”.
But is intervention beneficial in all tasks, also tasks where
judgment is supported by processes other than analysis of
causal or functional relations between cues and criterion?
Previous studies have mainly relied on tasks that invite use
of analytic thinking and abstraction. In this experiment we
use a simple additive task with many repetitions of the same
small set of stimuli. This task can be solved either by abstraction of cue-criterion relations or exemplar memory, and
apparently is (Juslin, Olsson, et al., 2003). Note that while
intervention is beneficial for inferring the task structure and
abstracting the cue-criterion relations, in regard to exemplar
memory it may incur a cost. A consequence of cue abstraction is that participants may concentrate more on the piecemeal analysis of individual cue-criterion relations at the cost
of considering and encoding entire feature patterns. Therefore, encouraging cue abstraction may have the side-effect
of promoting less efficient encoding of the exemplars.
With this background in mind, the experiments in this paper investigated whether the benefit from intervention generalizes also to a multiple cue judgment task where both cue
abstraction and exemplar memory are viable processes. We
also ascertained whether the participants spontaneously engage in the sort of controlled observation or “experimentation” afforded by intervention. Finally, to the extent that we
observed a benefit from intervention, we wanted to test the
hypothesis that this benefit is mediated by a relative shift
from exemplar memory to reliance of cue abstraction.

cues and requires a judgment of a continuous criterion.
Judgments are initially made in a training phase where
feedback about the correct criterion is provided after every
judgment. The cover story involves judgments of the toxicity of subspecies of the exotic (but fictitious) Death Bug.
The task is summarized in Table 1. The cues C1, C2, C3
and C4 take on values 1 or 0, where the value 1 signifies an
increase in toxicity. The toxicity c of a subspecies is a linear
additive function of the cues:
c=50+4·C1+3·C2+2·C3+1·C4
(1)
The criterion c is thus computed by assigning cue number
one, C1, most importance and therefore the largest weight
and cue number four, C4, the least importance.
When participants make judgments of the continuous criterion CAM suggests that they perform a mental analogue
of linear multiple regression. For each cue, the weight ωi
(i=1…4) is retrieved and the estimate of c is adjusted accordingly:
4

cˆ R = k + ∑ ω i ⋅ C i ,

(2)

i =1

where k = 50 + .5 ⋅ (10 − ∑ ω i ) . The value of k is to ensure a rotation of the intercept about 55. If ω1=4, ω2=3, ω3=2, and
ω4=1, Equations 1 and 2 are identical and, in principle, the
CAM affords perfectly accurate judgment in this task.

Models and Judgment Task
The two processes that are perhaps most often discussed in
categorization learning are rule-based and exemplar-based
processes (Ashby, Alfonso-Reese, Turken, & Waldron,
1998; Juslin, Jones et al., 2003; Juslin, Olsson et al., 2003;
Sloman, 1996; Smith, Patalano, & Jonides, 1998). Ruledbased models, like the cue abstraction model (CAM), implements the idea that people use controlled processes in
working memory to mentally integrate cues according to a
linear additive rule. In training participants abstract cue
weights that are used to estimate the criterion when a new
probe is presented (Juslin et al., 2003). In contrast, exemplar
models (EBM) assume that people make judgments by retrieving similar stored exemplars from memory (Medin &
Schaffer, 1978; Nosofsky & Johansen, 2000), a process that
involves rapid similarity-based processes. The exemplars
retrieved from memory are representations of holistic concrete experienced instances encountered in training.
We rely on an experimental design that has been successful in distinguish between cue abstraction and exemplar
memory in a multiple cue judgment task (Juslin, Olsson et
al., 2003). The task involves a probe defined by four binary

EBM implies that the participants make judgments by retrieving similar exemplars from memory. When EBM is
applied to judgments of a continuous criterion, the estimate

The aims of Experiment 1 were three-fold: First, to replicate
the benefit of active intervention observed in previous studies with the sort of multiple-cue judgment used in the present study. Second: to investigate if people spontaneously
realize this possibility to make controlled observation when
they can actively intervene with the stimuli in training?
Third: provided that the beneficial effect of intervention is
replicated, to find out if this improvement is associated with
a shift from exemplar memory to cue abstraction.
In Experiment 1 we compared the performance by participants who observed (the observation condition) or actively constructed (the intervention condition) the stimuli in
the training phase. Although interveners are given a target
criterion for the exemplar they create by selecting the cue
values, they do have the freedom to make controlled observations so as to make cue abstraction more efficient, for
example, by structuring the successive exemplars that they
create so that they differ with respect to a single cue. This
should promote cue abstraction, while observation with no
control over the cues should make cue abstraction harder; in
particular, if it is heavily biased towards estimating linear
slopes between successive exemplars differing with respect
to a single cue (Juslin, Karlsson, & Olsson, 2004).
We hypothesized that interveners should exploit the possibility to make controlled observations by more often creating successive exemplars differing with respect to only one
cue as compared to the baseline provided by the observers,
and that, relative to the observers, there should be a shift
from exemplar memory to cue abstraction among interveners. The possibility to make controlled observation should
improve learning for interveners and we expected them to
need fewer trials to reach a certain learning criterion.

where p is the probe to be judged, xj is stored exemplar j
(j=1…J), S(p,xj) is the similarity between probe p and exemplar xj. Eq. 4 is the original context model (Medin &
Schaffer, 1978) applied to a continuum (see, Delosh et al.,
1997; Juslin et al., 2003). The similarity between probe p
and exemplar xj is computed according to the multiplicative
similarity rule of the original context model:

where di is an index that takes value 1 if the cue values on
cue dimension i coincide (i.e., both are 0 or both are 1), and
si if they deviate (i.e., one is 0, the other is 1). si are four
parameters in the interval [0, 1] that capture the impact of
deviating cues values (features) on the perceived similarity
S(p,xj). A value of si close to 1 implies that a deviating feature on this dimension has no impact on the perceived similarity and is considered irrelevant. A value of si close to 0
means that the similarity S(p,xj) is close to 0 if this feature is
deviating, thus assigning crucial importance to it. For low si,
only identical exemplars have an effect on the judgments.
Extra- and interpolation measures how well the correct
cue-criterion relations have been abstracted (DeLosh, 1997).
If the participant is able to make correct judgments for the
new extreme exemplars presented in the test phase (i.e. is
able to extrapolate), the participant is likely to have figured
out the underlying cue-criterion relations. This suggests the
use of cue abstraction. If an exemplar process is used the
participants are unable to extrapolate beyond the range of
stimuli seen in training. When judging the new exemplars in
the middle range, there will be no systematic differences
between new and old with a cue abstraction process. With
exemplar processes old exemplars are more correctly judged
than new exemplars, because old exemplars with the correct
criterion can be retrieved from memory.

Method
Participants. Forty-eight undergraduate students from Uppsala University volunteered. All received payment of approximately 80 SKr ($10) or course credit. Thirty-eight participants were women and ten were men. The participants
had a mean age of 25.5 years (range 19-44, SD=5.66). All
participants were tested individually.
Materials and Procedure. For the observers each learning
trial consisted of the presentation of text descriptions of a
fictitious death bug species with four binary attributes (long
or short legs, green or brown back, long or short nose, spotted or unspotted fore back). Five exemplars were omitted
from training. The omitted bugs were Exemplars 1, 5, 6, 7
and 16 (see Table 1). All participants were shown the exemplars in a new and independent random order.
The participants answered the question “What is the toxicity of this bug?” and made a numerical response (% toxicity) on each trial. Feedback about the correct toxicity followed the response and remained on the screen until the

of 45 trials was completed and then training continued until
the participant had satisfied a pre-determined learning criterion (an average Root Mean Square Deviation RMSD of 0.8
or less between judged and actual toxicity over the preceding 11 trials).
Interveners saw the same screen layout as observers but
rather than seeing predetermined configurations of attributes, interveners selected four attributes on each trial (e.g.,
brown back, long nose, short legs, spotted fore back). Their
task was to create a bug of a given toxicity. Thus, on a trial
they were asked, for example, to “Create a bug that has toxicity 57%”. After selecting all four features and clicking
“create” feedback on the toxicity of the created bug was
given. The program did not allow participants to create the
five omitted exemplars, ensuring that in both conditions
only the Old exemplars in Table 1 could be seen. If an omitted exemplar were about to be created an error message appeared on the screen saying “An error occurred in creation,
please try another configuration”.
Consistent with the observation condition participants
completed a minimum of 45 trials and then continued until
achieving the same predetermined criterion. Following
learning half of participants from both groups received a test
phase in which each of the 16 exemplars was presented
twice in a random order, for a total of 32 trials. Participants
responded in the same manner as observation learning, but
received no feedback. The other half from both groups received an intervention test phase, where the task was to create a bug of a given toxicity without any feedback. This
partition was made to see if same training and test condition
could boost performance (Morris, Bransford, & Franks,
1977). Finally, all participants were given a series of questions and tasks designed to elicit their insight into the structure of the task (not reported in this article).

than the baseline obtained in observation. The correlation
between the EI and RMSE was r48 = .19, not significant (p=

Model Fit. The four best-fitting parameters for each model
were ascertained by minimizing the SSD between model
predictions and the last judgment made for each of the 11
exemplars in the training phase (see Table 1). The models
with these parameters were then used to predict how the
participants should perform in the test phase with all 16 exemplars (see Juslin et al., 2003). This implies crossvalidation for the 11 old exemplars and genuine predictions
for the 5 new exemplars. The models thereby predict what
the judgments would be like if the participants in each task
used either the EBM or the CAM. The fit between the 16
predictions and the 16 mean judgments made in the test
phase is measured by the RMSD. Model fit was performed
on individual level. A Split-plot ANOVA with training and
test condition (observation vs. intervention) as betweensubjects factors and model (CAM vs. EBM) as withinsubjects factor yielded a significant main effects of training
condition (F1,46=7.2, p=.001), significant effect of model
(F1,46=16.57, p=.000), but as illustrated in Figure 2 (left
panel) it is the significant interaction (F1,44=11.74, p=.001)
that is the key effect. In the observation training condition
the CAM provides superior fit, but in the intervention training condition both models show relatively poor fit.

Results and Discussion
The results from the test phase are analyzed in two different
ways. First, in terms of performance where judgment accuracy in the two conditions is compared; second, by cognitive
modeling, examining how CAM and the EBM are manifested in the participant’s judgment through a model fit.

was a strong tendency towards more accurate judgments and
better fit for CAM with observation. Both groups needed a
similar number of trials to reach the pre-determined learning
criterion. It seems clear that these data provide no evidence
for increased performance with active intervention or for a
shift towards more cue abstraction, despite that the participants in the intervention condition spontaneously engaged
in “experimentation” when this was made possible.

Experiment 2
To further investigate if active intervention with stimuli in
training produces a representational shift between different
representations Experiment 2 was conducted. The training
phase in earlier experiments with this paradigm has been
220 trials long (Juslin, Jones et al., 2003; Juslin, Olsson et
al., 2003). One possibility is that in the intervention condition, the participants begin with more or less fragmentary
exemplars and as training proceeds cue abstraction is slowly
improved by more extensive experience with intervention.
The aim of Experiment 2 was therefore to investigate if
increasing the number of training trials would increase the
difference between the two conditions in regard to performance and dominating representation. In addition, Experiment
2 serves the complementary purpose of collecting more data
on one intriguing aspect of Experiment 1; the marginally
significant deterioration in performance for interveners.
Manipulation of observation versus intervention at test produced no effects in Experiment 1 and in Experiment 2 observation was used in the test phase for both conditions.

intervention condition, and the cue abstraction model shows
superior fit in both of these training conditions.

Experiment 2 followed the same procedure as Experiment 1.
The difference between the two experiments was the number of learning trials. Rather than continuing until reaching a
predetermined learning criterion, all participants completed
220 trials, ensuring that each of the 11 exemplars was presented (Observation) or asked for (Interveners) 20 times.
Twenty-four undergraduate students from Uppsala University took part and were rewarded in the same manner as in
Experiment 1. Ten participants were male and 14 were female, with a mean age of 25.71 (range 20-45, SD=4.85).

Results and Discussion
The data in Experiment 2 were analyzed in the same way as
in Experiment 1. Comparisons are made between Experiments 1 and 2 to investigate the effect of increased training.

Experiment 2 provides further evidence that active intervention can actually instill poorer learning than passive observation in a task with binary cues, where more active experimentation actually contributes to poorer judgments. We
also performed an analysis with data aggregated across Experiments 1 and 2. A two-way ANOVA with RMSE as dependent variable and intervention vs. observation and Experiment 1 vs. 2 as independent variables shows significant
main effects of training condition (F1, 68=6.33, MSE=.44,
p=.01) and Experiment (F1, 68=5.6, MSE=.44, p=.02), but no
statistically significant interaction (F1, 68=.15, MSE=.44,

Performance. A one-way ANOVA on the RMSE shows a

The experimentation indices was computed for separate

duced more accurate judgments and intervention contributed
to poorer judgments as compared to passive observation.
The increased training did not serve to separate the two
conditions from each other and there were no signs of a shift
from exemplar memory to cue abstraction. The overall superiority of cue abstraction was even clearer in this experiment
as compared to the previous experiments and this superiority does not appear strengthened by allowing the participants to actively intervene with stimuli.

General Discussion
In two experiments we examined if different activities in the
learning phase affect the knowledge representation in a multiple cue judgment task. Previous studies suggests that intervention in learning improves performance (Gopnik et al.,
2004; Klayman, 1988; Lagnado & Sloman, 2004; Steyvers
et al., 2003). In our experiments we have found that intervention and causal experimentation does not always improve performance. Apparently, in an environment with
binary cues and a continuous criterion intervention as a
learning method can not compete with simple and passive
observation. A possible explanation is that improvement in
judgment with intervention as learning method is limited to
environments that spontaneously invite cue abstraction.
When cues are binary and fewer exemplars exist in the environment, memorization of exemplars precedes the abstraction of rules in both learning conditions. The use of intervention and the search of a rule suppresses the possibility to
memorize correct exemplars, but in observation the process
of memorization of exemplars starts immediately.
No shift in representation from EBM to CAM could be
found. In the observation condition CAM had significantly
better fit in both experiments. In intervention no differences
existed between CAM and EBM in Experiment 1, but in
Experiment 2 CAM became the best fitting model.
The poor performance in the Intervention condition (especially in Experiment 1) raises intriguing issues about how
exemplars are coded and stored in memory. A default assumption in research on perceptual classification is that exemplars are stored in terms of visual features of the objects,
as is naturally the case in the Observation condition. In the
Intervention condition it is however possible that, exemplars
are not exclusively or even mainly coded in terms of visual
features, but in terms of the sequence of actions required to
produce an exemplar of a specific toxicity. Clearly, the exact interpretation of “exemplar” is open to somewhat different interpretations in this case.
To conclude, our results suggest that the proposition that
experimentation is better than simple observation is not always true. Contrary to Mill and the believers in the superiority of active learning, intervention as a learning strategy is
not always better.
