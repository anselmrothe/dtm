Abstract
The present study explores hemispheric differences in verb and
verb-derived noun production in terms of the impact of various
picture and word characteristics on visual field reaction time
variance. The unique contribution of predictors has been
interpreted as activation of a corresponding property, as
indication of a stage of picture processing and as activation of a
corresponding mechanism/system in a certain hemisphere. The
results of a regression analysis suggested that action-associated
images were activated in the right hemisphere independently of
the type of word produced. However, activation patterns in the
left hemisphere appeared to be sensitive to the difference in
word types. Whereas verb production activated the conceptual
system in the left hemisphere, verb-derived noun production
activated the lexical system in the same hemisphere. This
differential pattern was interpreted in terms of the different
weights of motor information carried by verbs and verb-derived
nouns.
Keywords: action naming; lateralized picture presentation;
reaction time.

Introduction
Recently, many studies have reported evidence for processing
differences between parts of speech such as nouns and verbs.
This evidence comes from neurological studies suggesting
that nouns and verbs are processed by distinct neural systems
(Damasio & Tranel, 1993; Daniele, Giustolisi, Silveri,
Colosimo, & Gainotti, 1994; Gainotti, Silveri, Daniele, &
Giustolisiр 1995; Shapiro, Pascual-Leone, Mottaghy,
Gangitano, & Caramazza, 2001; Shapiro & Caramazza, 2003)
as well as from electrophysiological studies which point to
distinct neural generators for nouns and verbs in the intact
brain (Koenig & Lehmann, 1996; Pulvermüller, Preissl,
Lutzenberger,
&
Birbaumer,
1996;
Pulvermüller,
Lutzenberger, & Preissl, 1999). Behavioral studies using
word recognition and a visual field (VF) experimental
paradigm have supported the idea that nouns and verbs are
processed differently and by widely distributed brain
structures (Sereno, 1999; Nieto, Santakruz, Hernandez,
Camacho-Rosales, & Barosso, 1999). Seemingly consistent in
suggesting processing differences, neurological and
electrophysiological studies vary in associating different brain
areas with processing of each word class. Usually, results of
lesion studies associate the left frontal lobe with verb
processing and the left temporal cortex with noun processing
(e.g., Damasio & Tranel, 1993; Gainotti et al., 1995; Shapiro
et al., 2001; Hillis, Tuffiash, Wityk, & Barker, 2002).
However, a recent neuropsychological meta-analysis of
impaired and spared naming for various categories suggested
that semantic representations of such categories as actions,

artifacts, living things, etc. are bilaterally distributed and
anatomically closely connected with those areas that
contributed to the development of these categories (Gainotti,
2004). That is, the study supports the sensory-motor model of
semantic knowledge which assumes that conceptual and
semantic representations are built on the basis of brain
structures that subserve sensory-motor mechanisms involved
in the development of these categories. A similar view is
supported by electrophysiological data that showed the
activation of motor areas in verb processing and the activation
of occipital areas in concrete noun processing (Pulvermüller
et al., 1996; Pulvermüller et al., 1999). These authors suggest
that verbs highly associated with action may form functional
units, distributed over areas, including those related to
movement/motor activity, and nouns, highly associated with a
visual sense, would form functional units that include
visual/occipital areas.
Behavioral VF studies on word recognition are less specific
suggesting no lateralization in noun processing and a left
hemisphere advantage for verb processing (Sereno, 1999). In
addition, Nieto et al. (1999), manipulating the imageability of
nouns and verbs, observed no hemispheric differences in the
processing of high and medium imagery nouns and of high
imagery verbs and a left hemisphere advantage in the
processing of low imagery nouns and medium and low
imagery verbs. Thus, the study suggested that more
lateralization exists for verbs than for nouns and that
lateralization depended on word imageability.
The present study aimed to contribute to the existing
evidence on word class processing differences by exploring
lateralized processing in a production task for verbs and verbderived nouns (VDNs). VDNs in Bulgarian are close to the
English gerund and are formed by adding a derivational
morpheme to the root of a verb. Mainly, verbs and VDNs
differ in their syntactic role in the sentence, in their lexical
form and in movement-based information (motor-action
semantics) with verbs carrying stronger action semantics than
VDNs do.
The present study uses a large number of potential
predictors conventionally believed to influence lexical access
and to reflect different types of information (e.g., conceptual,
semantic, and lexical) that is usually measured and analyzed
in traditional picture naming experiments. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first attempt in exploring differences in
lateralized action naming with two word forms based on the
same root and produced in response to identical action
pictures.
Picture naming is a complex production-like process
influenced by many, usually interconnected, factors (for a
review, see Johnson, Paivio & Clark, 1996). Models of
picture naming postulate at least three distinct stages – object

1042

(or action, in our case) identification, name activation, and
response production (Johnson et al., 1996), while some go so
far as five stages, e.g., Levelt’s model (Levelt, 2001) which
distinguishes the following: recognition of visual object (or
action), concept activation, lemma (grammatical information)
activation, lexeme (phonological level) activation, and
articulation. In picture naming in a central presentation mode,
the most powerful predictors of performance are name
agreement and/or number of alternative names to a picture
(measures of uncertainty), image agreement and age of
response word acquisition (AoA). Name agreement usually
refers to the degree to which participants agree on the name
of the picture measured by the percentage of people who
produced a given name. The number of alternative names
refers to the number of valid names given to a picture. Image
agreement reflects the degree (subjectively rated) to which a
mental image generated by participants in response to the
name of the picture matches the picture. AoA, measures of
uncertainty and image agreement have been shown to be
strong predictors of picture naming reaction time (RT) in a
number of studies (e.g., Kremin, Hamerel, Dordain, De Wilde
& Perrier, 2000; Bonin, Chalard, Méot & Fayol, 2002). Most
recent studies on picture naming in a central presentation
mode use multivariate regression analysis to determine and
discuss predictors of picture naming processing recognizing
that picture naming is influenced by many factors that are
sometimes difficult to control. The present study uses several
predictor variables that reflect various levels of picture and
picture-related word structures such as picture visual
complexity, uncertainty measures, image agreement,
frequency and AoA of the response word, phonological
length, etc. Research on picture naming suggests that visual
complexity presumably affects an early stage of object
recognition (Johnson et al., 1996; Bonin et al., 2002). Image
agreement and object/action familiarity have an impact on the
level of object/action identification/concept activation that is,
the better the match between a pictured object/action and its
representation in the brain and the more familiar the
object/action is, the faster it would be processed (Cuetos, Ellis
& Alvarez, 1999; Bonin et al., 2002). Uncertainty affects
picture naming at or around the object/action
postidentification stage of name activation (Johnson et al.,
1996; Barry, Morrison, & Ellis, 1997; Bonin et al., 2002), i.e.,
the effect is presumably lexico-semantic. Frequency and AoA
may affect name activation at the phonological stage or
between the semantic and phonological stages (Johnson et al.,
1996; Cuetos et al., 1999; Bonin et al., 2002; Bonin, Barry,
Méot & Chalard, 2004). Word length affects name activation
and/or response generation (Johnson et al., 1996). Thus, the
significant contribution of a predictor to VF RT variance may
indicate not only activation of, or access to, the property in
the corresponding hemisphere but also approximately the
processing stage(s) of picture naming. Finally, activation of a
property and/or of a corresponding processing level can be
seen as indication of activation of the corresponding
system(s) or mechanism(s) in the hemisphere such as
conceptual, semantic, lexical, and phonological.

As noted, current data suggest that the action and object
conceptual and semantic systems are bilaterally distributed
(Pulvermüller et al., 1999; Gainotti, 2004) thus, it could be
expected that action naming, which necessarily involves
strong conceptual and semantic processing, may produce
bilateral conceptual and/or semantic activation. However,
VDN processing patterns and (possible) differences between
verb and VDN production in lateralized picture naming are
not clear.

Method
Participants 60 participants (28 males and 32 females) took
part in the action naming task and another 60 (30 males and
30 females) in the VDN production experiment. They were
university students with an average age of 22.0 years (age
range 18 to 35), right-handed Bulgarian monolinguals with
normal or corrected to normal vision. Participants received
course credit or were paid for their participation.
Stimuli and Predictor Variables 136 stimuli were selected
from the pictures in an on-line action naming task with 275
pictorial stimuli in Bulgarian, which was part of a crosslinguistic study, 50 participants per language (Szekely et al.,
2004). For more details on participants, procedures, and
pictorial stimuli in the picture naming norming study, see
Szekely et al. (2004) and/or visit an on-line data base at
http://www.crl.ucsd.edu/~aszekely/ipnp/.
All target names were subjected to five different tests
aimed at obtaining separate subjective ratings for word (verb
and VDN) frequency, action and VDN familiarity, action
image agreement, action and VDN imageability (procedure
adopted from Paivio, Yuille & Madigan, 1968), action and
VDN concreteness, all rated on a 1 to 7 scale, from lowest to
highest. Six different groups of 40 university students each
participated in the verb and VDN frequency, action and VDN
concreteness and imageability ratings. Familiarity ratings
(rated on a 1 to 7 scale, from lowest to highest) were obtained
from 20 students for action familiarity and from 16 students for VDN familiarity. In addition, 35 students participated in
the action image agreement procedure. Two different groups
of 30 students participated in action and VDN AoA rating
tasks on a 1 to 7 scale where 7 referred to the earliest acquired
items (under 2 years of age) and 1 to the most recently
acquired items (over 13 years old). None of the participants in
the rating tests participated in the on-line picture naming
experiment. Target names were coded for word length
measured in number of phonemes. Finally, subjective ratings
of picture visual complexity (7-point scale, 7 – the most
visually complex) were obtained from 30 Hungarian
university students (Székely, unpublished).
The number of valid alternative names to a picture and
name agreement for each VF and word class were derived
empirically after experimental data collection and included as
predictor variables. All target names were grammatically
unambiguous: either verbs in their citation form or verbderived nouns with an identical root for each picture across
word class and VF.

1043

Procedure Procedures in both experiments (verb and VDN
production) were identical apart from instructions concerning
the forms of words to be produced.
Stimuli (black and white line drawings, 4.5 x 4.5 cm) were
presented unilaterally, to the right or to the left of a fixation
point (a cross; “+”) in the center of the screen. The distance to
the center of the stimuli subtended a horizontal visual angle of
4 degrees in relation to the participant. The visual angle from
the fixation point to the nearest edge was 1.9 degrees. The
distance between the participant’s head and the screen was
kept at 60 cm.
Participants were tested in a sound-proof booth. Six
pseudo-randomized orders were constructed such that stimuli
appeared in the same VF no more than three consecutive
times. The experimental session started with 8 practice trials,
none of the practice pictures appeared in the experimental
part. The appearance of the stimuli in each visual field was
counterbalanced across participants, i.e., half of the
participants saw a stimulus in one VF, and the other half saw
the same stimulus in the other VF. Each stimulus was
presented only once to each participant – either in the left or
in the right visual field. Each stimulus was displayed for 200
msec. Immediately after stimulus disappearance a mask (one
out of ten variants of randomly distributed black lines and
curves on a white background was arbitrarily chosen for each
trial) was displayed at the same place as the stimulus for 200
msec. Participants were instructed to name pictures with
verbs (actions) in the first person, singular, present tense in
the action naming experiment, and to name pictures with
verb-derived nouns (examples of VDN form were provided)
in the VDN production experiment. In addition, participants
were asked to name pictures as fast and as accurately as
possible without moving their gaze away from the fixation
point. The importance of maintaining one’s gaze on the
fixation point was repeatedly stressed. The intertrial interval
varied randomly between 1 and 2 sec. If a participant
produced no response, the next trial started in 5 sec.
Responses were recorded by the experimenter. Reaction times
were measured from the offset of each stimulus. A Carnegie
Mellon button box recorded voice onset RT and controlled
stimuli presentation timing. A Power Macintosh 6400/200
equipped with the PsyScope software (Cohen, MacWhinney,
Flatt, & Provost, 1993) controlled the order of presentation
and the size of the stimuli. Each experimental session lasted
15-20 min.

After that items that produced different target names in each
VF and each word class, were excluded from further
analyses. Thus, the analyses were based on mean RTs for 119
target verb responses identical in each VF and 119 VDNs
with an identical verb root for each picture in each VF. For
example, in response to a picture depicting swimming, the
obtained target verbform in both VFs was pluvam (swim) and
the obtained target VDN in both VFs was pluvane
(swimming). Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the
predictor characteristics of each word class averaged over 119
items.

Comparing Mean RTs across Word Class and VF
A two-way analysis of variance obtained no significant main
effect or interaction (all ps>.1). Thus, no VF and word class
differences were found in lateralized picture naming task in
terms of overall naming speed, that is, the overall cognitive
demands on naming actions with the two different word
forms did not differ. Table 2 summarizes the descriptive
statistics for naming latencies in each VF and word class.

Results and Discussion
Trials on which no response was registered (7.3% in verb and
8.5% in VDN production) and trials with technical errors
(0.6% in verb and 0.9% in VDN production) were excluded
from the analyses. Response times lying more than 2 standard
deviations away from the mean were removed which resulted
in the removal of 3.7% (verb) and 4.3% (VDN) of overall
responses. The data were averaged for each word class by
items and VFs over participants and a mean RT for each valid
response was obtained. The number of alternative names to a
picture (including target), name agreement and target names
for each picture in each VF were derived from these data.

Regression with Predictor Variables
Simultaneous regression analyses were performed separately
for each VF and word class examining the contribution of the

1044

10 predictor variables. Results of the analyses are presented
in Table 3.
The predictors together accounted for 47.4% of LVF and
49.0% of RVF variance in verb production and for 42.7% of
LVF and 34.1% of RVF variance in VDN production. The
results showed (Table 3) that the most powerful predictor of
picture naming, i.e., percent of name agreement, made its
independent contribution to RT variance in both VFs and for
both parts of speech. Name agreement influences picture
naming at an early stage of name competition, the target preselection stage, and activates a lexico-semantic mechanism.
However, another powerful predictor, action image
agreement, emerged as a significant predictor in both VFs
with verb responses only and in the left but not right VF with
VDN responses (Table 3). Image agreement influences
picture naming at the early stages of recognition (Barry,
Morrison & Ellis, 1997), in our case, action recognition, that
is, the impact is on the conceptual level. RT to the right VF in
VDN production was influenced by length in phonemes and
AoA of response words (Table 3). As noted earlier, AoA
influences name activation somewhere in between the
semantic and phonological levels or only the phonological
one. The significant contribution of the word’s length
measured in numbers of phonemes suggests that the loci of
influence of these two variables do not coincide completely.
It may be suggested that AoA influences the target postselection stage or, in other words, it activates a lexicophonological mechanism. This suggestion is in accordance
with the results of a study of repetition priming of picture
naming (Barry, Hirsh, Johnston, & Williams, 2001) which
showed that AoA functions at the level of lexicophonological retrieval (the lexeme level).

Finally, and in addition, ratings for target action
concreteness made an independent contribution to the left VF
RT variance while the number of alternative names to a
picture affected right VF RT variance in verb production.
Note that name agreement also contributed to the RVF RT
variance in verb production (Table 3). In spite of the high
intercorrelation of name agreement and number of alternative
names (r=-.67), each of these variables made unique
independent contributions to RT variance, which confirms the
suggestion that even though highly correlated and generally
related to the relationship between a pictured object/action
and its name, these characteristics represent theoretically
distinct measures (Johnson et al., 1996). While name
agreement may be regarded as the degree of connection
strength between an object/action and a single dominant
lexical item, number of alternative names to a picture may be
viewed as the number of connections between an
object/action and (potential) lexical items or different names
to a picture (Johnson et al., 1996) that is, a measure that
reflects certain lexico-semantic characteristics such as
semantic neighborhood density or synonymy.
No effects of picture visual complexity, word frequency,
action familiarity or imageability were observed in any
condition. Overall, the results suggest that verb production
activated conceptual, semantic and lexico-semantic features
of action representation in both hemispheres while VDN
production affected hemispheric processing differentially by
inducing lexico-semantic and action-image activation in the
right hemisphere and activation of lexico-semantic, lexicophonological and purely phonological representations in the
left hemisphere.

The primary purpose of the study was to examine hemifield
processing of verb and VDN production and of hemispheric
activation of various language systems such as semantic,
lexical, and phonological. For this purpose, a multiple
regression analysis was used with lateralized picture naming.
The initial assumption and logic of applying this
methodology was based on the relationship between linguistic
systems/mechanisms, processing stages in picture naming and
the loci of impact of various factors that represent different
levels of picture and response word characteristics.
Independently of the type of response word and VF,
picture presentation prompted the activation of the lexicosemantic system in both hemispheres at an early name
identification stage where several picture-name candidates
compete with each other. Support for this finding comes from
an fMRI study of three semantic tasks (including verb and
noun generation) which suggests that the left inferior frontal
gyrus is involved in the selection of available responses
among
competitive
alternatives
(Thompson-Schill,
D’Esposito, Aguirre & Farah, 1997). In addition, a MEG
study of centrally presented picture naming (Levelt,
Praamstra, Meyer, Helinius & Salmelin, 1998) found that

1045

right parietal activation is associated with the processing of
lexical selection. Finally, Neininger & Pulvermüller (2003)
have shown that the right hemisphere is necessary for word
processing and that the right frontal lobe is related to the
processing of semantics and lexical form of a verb.
The activated language systems appeared to be sensitive to
both type of response word and VF. The verb production task
induced action-image activation in both hemispheres and
activation of action semantics in the right hemisphere. These
results support a suggestion (Oliveri, Finocchiaro, Shapiro,
Gangitano, Caramazza & Pascual-Leone, 2004) that verb
production may lead to the generation of motor/action mental
images and, consecutively, to bilateral activation of the
corresponding motor cortical regions. These authors
suggested that the mental images generated are related to
conceptual rather than semantic characteristics of verbs. In
addition, a neuropsychological meta-analysis of naming data
of various categories (Gainotti, 2004) strongly suggested that
frontal lobes play a critical role in the semantic representation
of actions and that these cortical areas overlap with areas that
subserve motor mechanisms which, in their turn, are related
to the action concept and to the process of development of
these representations.
VDN production elicited differential patterns of activation
in the two hemispheres. Similarly to the verb production
result, picture presentation to the LVF induced action-image
activation in the right hemisphere. However, picture
presentation to the RVF prompted activation of purely lexical
features, namely, lexico-phonological and phonological
characteristics of response words. One possibility for the
interpretation of this result may lie in the morphological
differences between the two word types. Tyler, Bright,
Fletcher & Stamatakis (2004) in a semantic categorization
task contrasted fMRI activation of regularly inflected nouns
(dogs) and verbs (cutting) and found that the left inferior
frontal gyrus is involved in the morpho-phonological
processing of verbs. However, verbs used in the present study
were also regularly inflected (first person, singular, present
tense). That is, most probably, the difference in activation
patterns of the two word classes in the left hemisphere was
not due to their difference in morphological structure.
Another possible interpretation of differences in activation
lies in the different weights of the motor semantic component
that is carried by both word classes. As noted, verbs contain
stronger action/movement based information than VDNs.
That is, superficial word-form processing occurred in the left
language-dominant hemisphere with a weak motor semantic
component of the VDNs produced, while action-image
representations were activated in the same hemisphere with a
stronger motor semantic component of verbs. The right
hemisphere appeared to be sensitive to the motor semantic
component independently of its strength; thus, it may be more
actively involved in the processing of action semantics than
the left language-dominant one.
Further investigation is needed to understand the brain
mechanisms that are activated in response to the visual field
of presentation and various characteristics of the stimuli.
