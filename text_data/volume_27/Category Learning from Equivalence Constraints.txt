  the two types of constraints never appeared together. Highly informative constraints, as demonstrated here, present pairs of images that
  differ in only one feature. In the current example, participants had to learn that skin color and ear shape are relevant for categorization.
  Specifically, NEC N2 informs participants that skin color is a relevant dimension because it is the only dimension discriminating between
  the two exemplars. Similarly, N1 and N3 both imply that ear shape is relevant for categorization. P1, P2 and P3 inform participants that
  eye color, nose shape and chin shape are not relevant for categorization since these features are different in pairs that belong to the same
  tribe. In the highly informative constraint task, as in the current example, all the information needed for proper categorization (for either
  NECs or PECs, separately) was provided (see text).
