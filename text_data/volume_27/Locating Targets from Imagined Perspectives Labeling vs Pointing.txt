Then they were asked to indicate the arrow that pointed the
same way. This was done to ensure that participants
understood how they were expected to point and also to
establish the meaning of the response alternatives.
Furthermore, because the response alternatives were
presented in the same order throughout the experiment, the
practice trials also served to offer practice at locating the
desired response without extensive visual search among the
alternatives.
   The practice trials were given before each experimental
task and each time were followed by 22 real trials. In both
tasks trials displayed an orthogonal table depicting six
characters sitting around it (Figures 1 and 2). The depicted
facing direction of two characters was aligned with the
physical orientation of the participant (0° perspective
