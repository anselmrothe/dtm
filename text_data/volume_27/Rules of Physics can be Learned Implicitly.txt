Participants There were 26 participants in this experiment.

Design and Materials There were a total of 21 3-
dimensional objects. The objects were divided into three                       (2)          (1)                (2)

convex curves; 2) 7 objects that are red, have the appearance
of a grid design, and are concave; and 3) 7 objects that are                   (3)          (3)                (2)
