it is the closest to the processing that takes place during
categorization and because it evaluates cognitive inhibition.          a)
In order to evaluate object categorization I have chosen an
object-sorting task that was derived form the literature (e.g.,
Waxman & Namy, 1997) and from some previous personal
case studies (Ionescu, 2001a; Ionescu, 2003). They will be

internal factors as essential in influencing flexible
categorization behavior, we can make two predictions:
a)    Children with low performance at the inhibition task will
      avoid to choose the object that was in the first category
      for the second one as well (see the Material section), and
      they will need longer time to solve the second
      categorization.
      Children with good inhibition will be as efficient in the
      second categorization as in the first.
