all the buttons and switches, and the proper sequences for
their use (to start transportation of grain into a silo, e.g.,
requires a sequence of 12-15 pushes of buttons, with
different time intervals). The control room staff, 2-3 people
working at a time, coordinates the off-loading and
transportation of grain into different silos.
