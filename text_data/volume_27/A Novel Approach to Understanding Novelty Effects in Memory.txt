                         Abstract
   Enhanced memory for oddball items has been long
   established, but the basis for these effects is not well
   understood. The present work offers a novel way to
   think about novelty that clarifies the roles of isola-
   tion and differentiation in establishing new memo-
   ries. According to the isolation account, items that
   are highly dissimilar to other items are better re-
   membered. In contrast, recent category learning
   studies suggest that oddball items are better re-
   membered because they must be differentiated from
   other similar items. The current work pits the isola-
   tion and differentiation accounts against each other.         Figure 1: Examples of isolation and differentiation
