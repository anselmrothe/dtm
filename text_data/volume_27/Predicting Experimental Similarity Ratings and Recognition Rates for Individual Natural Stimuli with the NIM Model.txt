face was set to 10 which corresponds to approximately 2 sec-
onds of viewing time. For recognition, the N IM model cal-
culated the familiarity of each target and lure on the basis
of 100 fixations (as described previously). Comparison of
the familiarity values to the decision criterion, θ, determined
the recognition rates, i.e., the hit-rates for the targets and the
false-alarm rates for the lures. In these simulations the radius
r and the decision criterion θ were varied to determine the
root mean square errors (RMSE) and the correlation values
between recognition rates produced by the N IM model and
experimentally obtained recognition rates. The radius r and
the decision criterion θ were our only free parameters.

the experimental data showed substantially larger variations
