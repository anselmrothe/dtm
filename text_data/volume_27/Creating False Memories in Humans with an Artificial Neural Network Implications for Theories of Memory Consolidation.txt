very different from the initial training exemplars.
   In order to make this point, an opposition method was
adopted: The PPs presented to the participants were selected
so as to resemble more some other exemplars (hereafter
control items) than the exemplars used to train the network
(hereafter target items). Participants were only presented
with selected PPs during a first, training phase, and then
tested with the target items and the control items. A higher
familiarity for the target items than for the control items–
though the latter resemble more the PPs previously
presented to the participants–would show a memory
transport between the neural network and the participants.
   The experiment is preceded by a simulation: A new
(untrained) GDN auto-associator was trained on the very
PPs stimuli used in the behavioral experiment. Starting from
a comparison of behavioral and simulation results, the
discussion will consider the possible interpretations of the
behavioral data.
                         Simulation
The simulations involved the construction of 106 items, also
used in the behavioral experiments (cf. Figure 1). The items
were matrices constructed as follows. Starting from the
centre of a 19¯19 black grid, the following procedure was
applied 20 times: A direction (up, down, left or right) was
randomly chosen and two squares in that direction were
turned white, then the last square served as starting point for
the procedure on the next step. Any resulting pattern wider
or higher than 13 squares was discarded, the remaining were
re-centered on a 13¯13 grid until 106 different and
meaningless items were available. Each item was then
coded as a vector of length 169, with black squares coded 0           Figure 1: Examples of the experimental material: a) List A

fed to the input layer, resulting activation propagated
through the network to the output layer, the output was then
fed to the input layer (reverberation), and again propagated
through the network, and so on. PPs are output patterns
produced after five re-injections (cf. Figure 1). Out of
4,325,000 PPs generated in this way, only those PPs that
complied with all the three following rules were retained:
   (R1) In terms of Euclidean distance, each selected PP is
closer to a control item than to any target item;
   (R2) To reduce the number of PPs while increasing their
variety, the RMS distance between any two selected PPs is
greater than .15;
   (R3) the mean of the Euclidean distances between each
target item and the centroid of the selected base of PPs (the
"mean PP", noted PPM) is greater than the mean of the
distances between each control item and PPM ; with a

Method
Participants Seventy students (mean age = 20.5 years, SD
= 1.6) participated for course credit.
Stimuli The PPs used in Simulation and the original 106
items were used as stimuli, displayed as 13¯13 matrices
(260¯260 pixels) centered on a black background on a 17"
(1024¯768 pixels) screen.
Design and procedure Participants first performed an
incidental study task: They were to detect a cross that
appeared (9 percent of the trials) in a random location on a
background made of PPs: PPs were displayed for 400 ms
each, with no void in between. Prior to performing this task
with the 3000-PP base, and in order to ensure optimal
exposure to it, participants underwent a warm-up phase
where 500 of the 3000 PPs were displayed.
   Then participants engaged in the duration judgment task:
They were to classify the display duration of images as                  Figure 3: Behavioral results. Effect of previous incidental
