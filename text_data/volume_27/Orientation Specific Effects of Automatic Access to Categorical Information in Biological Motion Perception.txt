that attempt to rebind local motion components (e.g., local
rigidity) into a hierarchical whole for the purpose of
identification. This is not to say that inverted displays cannot
be reliably detected or recognized. It is rather a relative lack
of access to categorical level information that distinguishes
the processing of upright actions from inverted actions.
   The findings from the work presented here confirm the
general findings of orientation specificity for biological
motion perception. The contribution from the experiments
presented here indicates that access to categorical level
information is one important factor that differentiates the
visual processing of upright actions from inverted actions.
