the following trial by pushing a button, as soon as the
participant’s eyes were centered on the computer screen; the
stimulus would appear after 750 ms. A predetermined order
of 12 trails was presented (0°, +22°, -67°, 180°, +112°,
-157°, -22°, 180°, +67°, -112°, +157°, 0°). The angles used
in the training differed from the angles used in the
experiment proper.
The experimental phase consisted in four blocks of 32
trials. The first block (A) was a mental rotation task without
rotating the handle. The participant’s hand rested on the
handle; this was done to keep the distance to the response
pad comparable with the second (B) and third (B) block, in
which the handle was rotated manually. The fourth block
(A) was again without manual rotation. This ABBA-design
provided the same amount of trials with and without
rotation, while equally distributing possible training effects.
Within each block, trials were presented in random order.             Figure 3: Stimulus orientations: positive orientations are

Response times
Response times of all correct trials were submitted to an
analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the within-subject
factors stimulus orientation (0º, +45º, +90º, +135º, 180°,
-135°, -90°, -45°), manual rotation (with or without) and
measurement repetition, as well as with the between-
subjects factor age.
