these fine-grained methods. In order to comply with
instructions favoring switching or maintenance, individuals
can modulate their rates of perceptual switching (Toppino,
2003).
    Therefore, the goal of the current study was to expand
upon previous work by examining the differences between
voluntary and involuntary perceptual switches between
interpretations of the Necker cube. If subjects are instructed
to maintain a given perspective, involuntarily switching to
the opposite view should require less cognitive effort than
making a voluntary switch back to the favored perspective.
This relationship should also be sustained across tasks of
increasing cognitive demand. We will use eye tracking in

performance and to analyze their robustness across                    Figure 1: Necker cube stimulus as seen by the participant.

time course of blink frequency, saccade frequency, and
saccade amplitude across these two types of perceptual
switches.

   Figure 5. Time course of blink frequency (column 1), saccade frequency (column 2), and saccade amplitude (column 3)
across all conditions. Data occurring during voluntary switches (filled symbols) and involuntary switches (open symbols) are
                                   shown relative to the time of the respective button press.
Although the factor experimental condition did not reach                                                           of button presses and were of similar magnitude. During the
