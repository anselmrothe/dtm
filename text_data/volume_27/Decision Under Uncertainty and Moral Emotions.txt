  Clearly, future studies are necessary to replicate and
extend our findings. As above mentioned, in our tasks the
question options were formulated in a specific manner: the
only option that allowed our guilty subject to rectify the
wrong was the riskless one, by contrast, the option that
allowed our victim participants to have a chance of
obtaining justice was the risky one. Hence, the riskless
choice was always associated with "justice" for guilty
participants, whereas the risky choice was always
associated with “justice” for the innocent victims. We did
not vary the answer alternatives in order to obtain an option
that was both risky and carry the moral goal for the guilty
subjects, and an option that was both riskless and carry the
moral goal for the innocent victims. Thus, it would be
useful if further studies varied the link between risk level of
the choice and "moral goal" that it carries. Although this
change in the options formulation, according to the present
findings, we expect that individuals will continue to prefer
the choice (the risky or riskless one) which allows them to
pursue the moral goal of re-establishing justice.
