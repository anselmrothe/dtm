            Rapid Verification Technique
Diagnostic tasks described above and many other tasks in
science domains require responses (drawing graphical task
representations) that cannot always be specified precisely in
advance. In paper-based formats, the first-step method could
be applied in all these situations. However, recording and
analyzing students’ rapid first-step responses in computer-
based environments may be technically challenging. In such
situations, an alternative rapid diagnostic approach could be
based on students’ rapid verifications of possible suggested
solution steps.
  With the rapid verification method, learners are presented
with a series of suggested possible (correct and incorrect)
solution steps reflecting various stages of the solution          Figure 1: Snapshot of the response window for an item.
