  postulating a shift between elemental and configural
  representations supporting learning. Here we outline an
  elemental model based on contemporary associative theory

  do so without any built-in assumptions of dimensionality and
  without requiring some strategic shift from elemental to
  configural processing. Further evidence in support for the

relying on dimensional assumptions when the dimension
itself is artificial may be less tenable. Alternatively, for the
purpose of simulating icon experiments, some models have
assumed that different units are solely activated by a single
type of icon but that the activation of each unit is directly
proportional to the number of copies of each icon. This too
is somewhat problematic. There is no way to gauge whether
two copies of an icon would indeed generate twice the
activation of a single copy, for instance. In any case, a
recent finding by Oakeshott (2002) has highlighted the
inadequacies of both of these approaches.

Using the same architecture but with two response output
units rather than one, we simulated a very similar
experiment in which the task was to learn to respond with a
left key press for one training stimulus (SL) and with a right
key press for another training stimulus (SR).              The
modifications to the model were kept to a minimum. The
system of representation expressed through the input units
and random fixed weights to the second-layer units was
identical to the animal model. Each of the second layer
units was connected to both output units, with weights
modified by the same mechanism as before. During training,
on each trial the output unit corresponding to the correct
response was given an external activation of 1 while the
incorrect response output had an external activation of 0.
