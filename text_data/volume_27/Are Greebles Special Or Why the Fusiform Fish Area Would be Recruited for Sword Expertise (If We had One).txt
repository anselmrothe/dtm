Abstract
The fusiform face area (FFA) has commonly been deemed an
area specialized for face processing. Many recent studies have
challenged this view by showing that the FFA also responds to
stimuli from domains in which the subject is an expert. We
have developed neurocomputational models to explore the
question of why an area initially devoted to face processing
would later be recruited for other domains. Previous studies
showed that the FFA could be a fine-level discriminator,
spreading apart similar stimuli in its representational space.
These characteristics would make it ideal for recruitment to
other fine-level discrimination tasks. These initial findings have
been challenged on several accounts. Here we introduce new
work showing that the expertise effect remains despite
additional controls on the type and difficulty of the task
presented.

Introduction
As its name suggests, the fusiform face area (FFA) has been
identified as an area that is specific to processing faces.
Imaging scans show increased activity of this area when face
stimuli are presented when compared to activation when nonface stimuli are presented (Kanwisher, McDermott & Chun,
1997). Damage to the FFA tends to lead to prosopagnosia (an
inability to recognize faces) and similar deficits, further
implicating this area in facial recognition (De Renzi et al.,
1994). There is also electrophysiological evidence in the form
of a maximum amplitude of a negative going wave about 170
ms following a stimulus (the N170) that shows that faces may
be handled differently at a neurological level (Eimer, 2000).
Based on this evidence and psychological evidence showing
that faces are processed differently at a behavioral level,
many have concluded that the FFA is a face-specific
processing module.
The view of the FFA as a module for face processing has
been challenged by evidence reporting that the fusiform face
area seems to be recruited for other tasks as well. Experts in
recognizing cars, birds, dogs, and Greebles (a class of
artificial objects developed by Isabel Gauthier) also show
increased activation of the fusiform face area (Gauthier et al.,
1999; Gauthier et al., 2000). Furthermore, visual experts
show an increased amplitude N170 when shown images from

their field of expertise when compared to items for which
they are not experts (birds for bird experts, versus dogs for
dog show judges) (Tanaka & Curran, 2003). In these studies,
subjects are defined as being experts when their reaction
times are as fast when verifying the category of an object at
the subordinate or individual level as they are when verifying
the category at the basic level.
These findings suggest a different account of the function
of the FFA, that the area is actually a subordinate-level, finegrained visual discrimination area. Humans become face
experts at a young age, and later in life they may pick up
additional areas of visual expertise as well. Under this
account, earlier studies showing the FFA being highly active
only in face processing did so because they did not choose
non-face stimuli with which the subjects were experts. Recent
studies (Grill-Spector, Knouf, & Kanwisher, 2004; Rhodes et
al., 2004; Yovel & Kanwisher , 2004) that purport to refute
the expertise claim never seem to achieve the stringent
reaction time requirement of expertise (defined above) in
their work. For example, although Grill-Spector et al.
recruited car experts, they then tested their subjects on antique
cars, which would presumably not be named quickly by their
“experts.” Indeed, this would seem to be an example of an
“other race effect” for cars, as it is already known that other
race faces also produce a lower response in the FFA (Golby et
al., 2001).
In any case, if one assumes the expertise hypothesis, this
leads to the question of what characteristics do these different
expert-level tasks share that would cause one area of the brain
to be used for them but not for basic-level tasks. It has been
suggested that the FFA implements a process of fine level
discrimination (Tarr & Gauthier, 2000). As we have shown
elsewhere (Joyce & Cottrell, 2004), and elaborate on here, we
believe that the main feature of this process is a
transformation that takes similar visual items and magnifies
the differences between them. This transformation generalizes
to novel domains, and tuning of the transform allows the
model FFA to acquire new expertise faster than an area that
simply categorizes objects at the basic level (e.g., Lateral
Occipital Complex (LOC)). This suggests that in a
competition between cortical areas for processing a new task,
the FFA would have a distinct advantage, thus explaining
why the FFA would become recruited for novel expertise
tasks – it simply learns them faster than an area that only

2196

performs basic level processing. Computational models allow
us the ability to examine such issues in more detail than can
be achieved in human subjects, or even in monkeys. The main
prediction such models make is that the variance of the
responses of neurons in the FFA will be greater to objects of
expertise (Sugimoto & Cottrell, 2001; Joyce & Cottrell,
2004).
These early models only examined the effects of expertise
when learning Greebles, a class of objects designed
specifically to have some special properties. Here we
replicate and expand the earlier work, showing that the effect
is not unique to Greebles. The original experiments also had
the expert networks performing a greater number of
discriminations and a more difficult task. Hence there were a
larger number of outputs in the FFA model network
compared to the basic level categorizer. Perhaps it was simply
the number of distinctions being drawn by the expert
networks that made them better at differentiating new
categories (Michael Tarr, personal communication). In more
recent work, Tran, Joyce, and Cottrell (2004) controlled for
the number of classes being identified in a letter/font task,
showing that the effect remained. However, the domains were
letters rather than object categories, and the relative difficulty
of the two tasks, recognizing letters versus recognizing fonts,
was not controlled. This paper introduces a new set of
controls and stimuli that address these concerns.
In what follows, we first report on an experiment that
suggests there is nothing special about Greebles as a novel
expertise task; it turns out that an area that is a cup expert is
faster at learning faces than one that is not. The second
experiment demonstrates that the expertise advantage persists
when the basic and expert tasks are equal in their difficulty
and number of classifications being made.

submitted to principal component analysis in order to reduce
the dimensionality to forty PCA projections. It should be
noted that the phase two stimulus objects were not included in
the PCA in order to have them be truly novel to the model.
The results of the PCA were z-scored again before being fed
to the networks. The networks themselves were standard
feed-forward networks trained using back-propagation and
initialized with random weights. There were forty input
neurons (one for each principal component), sixty hidden
units, and one output unit for each basic or subordinate level
category. The learning rate was set to 0.01 with a momentum
of 0.5 and the networks were initialized with random weights.

Experiment One
The stimulus set consisted of the 300 64 x 64 8-bit grayscale
images comprising five basic-level classes (books, cans, cups,
faces, and Greebles) that were used in previous experiments
(Sugimoto & Cottrell, 2001; Joyce & Cottrell, 2004). Each
basic-level class of sixty images had twelve subordinate level
categories, each composed of five instances of that class.
Each subordinate class of faces was composed of images of a
human face producing different facial expressions.
Subordinate classes from other classes had individual
instances formed by rotating an image by as much as 3
degrees and shifting in a cardinal direction by a pixel. In
earlier work Greebles were set aside for phase two training,
during which the networks learned them as novel area of
expertise (Joyce & Cottrell, 2004). To eliminate the
possibility that the observed effects were unique to Greebles,
the experiment was repeated with each of the object classes
serving as the phase two stimulus set.
Images went through several stages of preprocessing before
being presented to the networks. First they were run through a
bank of Gabor wavelet filters of five different scales and eight
orientations to approximate the processing that occurs in
visual brain area V1. The result is z-scored and then

Figure 2: Network architecture
During phase one, all networks were trained to discriminate
between the four basic-level classes (ex. book, can, cups,
faces). Expert networks were additionally trained to
discriminate ten subordinate level classes for one of the four

2197

phase one classes (ex. Bob, Carol, Anne). Thus, basic-level
networks had 4 output units, while expert-level networks had
14. Five networks of each type were trained, making 25
networks in all. Training continued well past the point of
leveling off, to 5120 epochs of training. At various points in
the training, the network's weights were saved (after 1, 10, 20,
40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, and 5120 epochs).
During phase two, the weights of each of these saved
networks were used as the initial weights of a network that
was then trained on the phase two stimuli at the subordinate
level. This required an additional 11 output neurons for the
networks (1 for basic-level phase two discrimination, 10 for
the subordinate-level), The total number of neurons during
phase two were therefore 15 for basic-level networks (5
basic-level categories, 10 subordinate level categories) and 25
for expert networks (5 basic-level categories, 20 subordinatelevel categories). Training with the set of phase one stimuli
continued during phase two. The second phase continued
until error rates fell below .05 for the phase two stimuli.
Results revealed that basic-level discriminations were
learned more quickly than expert ones during phase one,
showing that the expert-level tasks were more difficult (see
Figure 3). More interestingly, however, the expert-level
networks learned the new expert-level task in less time during
phase two than the basic-level networks (see Figure 4).
Although this was true even when the amount of training
occurring in phase one was minimal or nonexistent (due to
the fact that phase one training is still ongoing in phase two),
the advantage increased as the amount of phase one training
increased. These results follow the pattern displayed in earlier
studies, showing that the effect is not unique to Greebles.

Experiment 2
Several factors could be influencing the results of the first
experiment. The subordinate level discriminations being
made in this experiment are simply more difficult, possibly
causing the phase one training of expert networks to extract
more discriminating information, which then generalizes to
the new categories. Secondly, the number of discriminations
being made by the expert is far larger than the basic-level
network (14 categories versus 4). Finally, the expert-level
network is currently being trained to make all the basic-level
distinctions in addition to their expert-level specialty.

Figure 5: Six of the object classes for experiment two (cars,
glasses, lamps, hats, chairs, and fish)
To address these concerns, a new data set was constructed
that would have additional controls in place. This new data
set consisted of 13 basic level object classes (balls, brass
instruments, cars, chairs, doughnuts, fish, fruits, glasses,
guitars, hats, lamps, ships, and swords). Each basic class was
composed of 13 subordinate-level classes with 5 instances per
subordinate class. Images were gathered from Hemera.com
and were shrunk to 64 x 64 pixels, grayscaled, and
normalized for luminance and contrast. As in the earlier
experiment, object instances were made by rotating the
objects by up to 3 degrees and shifting by up to a pixel. Three
of these classes (lamps, ships, and swords) were set aside for
use during phase 2. The remaining 10 classes were used in
phase one training for basic classification. The set of faces
used in the first experiment were re-used for expert-level
training.
The basic network architecture and training procedures
were identical to those described in the first experiment. Basic
networks had one output unit corresponding to each of the ten
basic-level classes. Expert networks had one output unit
corresponding to each of ten faces. To model similar early
stages of processing, the principle components were
calculated with the combined data set but omitting the three
object classes reserved for phase two. The total number of
images in the basic and expert data sets was the same, but

performance is shown in black, while expert networks’
performance is shown in pink.

during training a network was only exposed to one of the data
sets. During phase two, an additional ten output units were
added to discriminate between ten subordinate-level classes
of a new class (lamps, ships, or swords), bringing the total
number of outputs for both basic-level and expert networks to
twenty. As in the previous experiment, training on the phase
one stimuli was continued in phase two, with training ending
when error rates on the phase two stimuli fell below a
threshold.
In this experiment, the two types of networks were matched
in the number of discriminations they must make. Expert
networks are no longer trained to do the basic level task in
addition to the expert level one. The number of classes is
larger and contains objects unlikely to be considered facelike. Comparing Figures 3 and 6, we see that the two tasks are
now approximately matched in their difficulty. Despite these
additional controls, the expertise effect remained strong
(Figure 7).

Analysis
Examining the activation of the hidden units, there is a clear
increase in the within-class variance for the expert-level
networks compared to the basic-level networks. Intuitively,
this makes sense, as an expert network must spread out its
internal representation to differentiate between similar
exemplars. A basic-level network, on the other hand, tries to
map differing images into the same class, compressing its
representation of each class. As the basic level networks
become trained as experts during phase two, this difference
diminishes. This is shown in Figure 8.
Interestingly, this increased within-class variance for expert
networks carried through to the unseen phase two stimuli
(Figure 9). This means that the different subordinate classes
for the new task are already differentiated to some extent in
the representational space for the expert-level networks prior
to the networks ever being exposed to phase two stimuli. This
early differentiation makes the new task easier to learn.

networks after phase one training. Faces were the novel
stimulus and are shown as black circles. The first two

Neural networks trained to perform subordinate level
discrimination in one class of objects show an advantage
when learning a new class of objects at the subordinate level
when compared to networks trained at the basic level. This is
because learning an expert-level task causes the network to
spread out objects from the same class in its representational
space, increasing the within-class variance of all classes, even
unseen ones. The results were not specific to one object class
and were robust to additional controls on the difficulty of task
and number of discriminations being made.
This provides further evidence for our contention that the
FFA is recruited for new expertise tasks because of the way it
treats its inputs: it magnifies small differences between
homogeneous objects. Furthermore, this paper also confirms
our position that it is the nature, not the number, of the
distinctions that matter when visual objects are processed.
That is, in the expert networks, they are given many objects of
the same sort, and are required to distinguish among them.
This problem clearly requires magnifying within class
variance, in contrast to the basic level categorization process,
which requires magnifying between class variance while
minimizing within class variance.
This paper therefore furthers our investigation into the issue
of how the FFA, if one believes that it is a fine level
discrimination area, becomes recruited for novel expertise
tasks (the “visual expertise mystery”, Joyce & Cottrell, 2004).
Here we have shown that again, visual expertise is a general
skill – being a “fish expertise area” is a good prerequisite for
