studies, showing that the effect is not unique to Greebles.

              glasses, lamps, hats, chairs, and fish)
   To address these concerns, a new data set was constructed
that would have additional controls in place. This new data
set consisted of 13 basic level object classes (balls, brass
instruments, cars, chairs, doughnuts, fish, fruits, glasses,
guitars, hats, lamps, ships, and swords). Each basic class was
composed of 13 subordinate-level classes with 5 instances per
subordinate class. Images were gathered from Hemera.com
and were shrunk to 64 x 64 pixels, grayscaled, and
normalized for luminance and contrast. As in the earlier
experiment, object instances were made by rotating the
objects by up to 3 degrees and shifting by up to a pixel. Three
of these classes (lamps, ships, and swords) were set aside for
use during phase 2. The remaining 10 classes were used in
phase one training for basic classification. The set of faces
used in the first experiment were re-used for expert-level
training.
   The basic network architecture and training procedures
were identical to those described in the first experiment. Basic
networks had one output unit corresponding to each of the ten
basic-level classes. Expert networks had one output unit
corresponding to each of ten faces. To model similar early
stages of processing, the principle components were
calculated with the combined data set but omitting the three
object classes reserved for phase two. The total number of
images in the basic and expert data sets was the same, but            Figure 7: Time to learn new task (lamps, ships, or swords) as

during training a network was only exposed to one of the data
sets. During phase two, an additional ten output units were
added to discriminate between ten subordinate-level classes
of a new class (lamps, ships, or swords), bringing the total
number of outputs for both basic-level and expert networks to
twenty. As in the previous experiment, training on the phase
one stimuli was continued in phase two, with training ending
when error rates on the phase two stimuli fell below a
threshold.
   In this experiment, the two types of networks were matched
in the number of discriminations they must make. Expert
networks are no longer trained to do the basic level task in
addition to the expert level one. The number of classes is
larger and contains objects unlikely to be considered face-
like. Comparing Figures 3 and 6, we see that the two tasks are
now approximately matched in their difficulty. Despite these
additional controls, the expertise effect remained strong
(Figure 7).

Examining the activation of the hidden units, there is a clear
increase in the within-class variance for the expert-level
networks compared to the basic-level networks. Intuitively,
this makes sense, as an expert network must spread out its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Figure 9: PCA of hidden unit activation for each class of
