symposium addresses the question of whether abstract               positive ends of two dimensions, as for instance, in the
cognition is related to the ability to perceive, represent, and    association between “more” and “up.” In this talk, I propose
reason about spatial information. We discuss whether the           that polarity, an organizational structure present in both
spatial schemas that humans learn by observing the                 language and perception, may account for many of these
locations and movements of objects and the configuration of        consistent mappings between dimensions. Dimensions that
our environment might provide mechanisms for cognition,            are polar in organization have one end that is “more” and
or whether spatial schemas are simply metaphors that help          one end that is “less.” Mappings based on polarity align the
us to understand cognitive processes. Three talks from             two positive ends and the two negative ends. Such mappings
