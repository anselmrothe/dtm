The operation of complicated machines involves the entire                  In our simulation, participants assume the role of the

would respond by switching to the valid information source.
   Three cognitive observations suggest that the response of
human operators is more complex. First, feedback and
negative outcomes show that some task component has
failed, but not necessarily which one. In prior work, we
proposed a theory of how people learn from negative
outcomes when the learner knows that the cause of the
negative outcome is a fault in his or her task strategy
(Ohlsson, 1996), but in human-machine interactions, the
learner also has to consider the possibility that the machine
is failing. How do individuals decide which component is
responsible?
   Second, training produces biases and automaticity that
might interfere with rapid adaptation to changing task
demands (Allport, A., Styles, E. A., & Hsieh, S., 1994).
Although quickly switching from one task set to another                       Figure 1: Example of factory interface. Note. Factory
