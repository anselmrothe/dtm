Abstract
In this paper we present the results of an empirical study which
investigated the hypothesis that there is a theory change in
children’s categorizations of the earth. Fifth graders categorize
the earth as a solar object but this is not the case for first
graders. Sixty-two children, 43 ranging in age from 6 to 7 years
and 19 ranging in age from 10 to 11 years, were interviewed
individually using a Categorization Task and an Earth Shape
and Gravity Task. The results showed a developmental shift
from the categorization of the earth as a physical object to the
categorization of the earth as a solar object. High correlations
were also obtained between the categorization of the earth and
the understanding of its spherical shape.

Introduction
A great deal of the cognitive science literature on the
development of categorization has focused on the debate
between similarity-based vs. theory-based accounts (Fisher
& Sloutsky, 2004; Gelman & Markman, 1986; Goldstone,
1994; Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004). There seem to be two
assumptions or “dogmas” (Keil, Smith, Simons, & Levin,
1998) that embody this controversy: (a) that children
initially have only a similarity-based component for learning
concepts and that the theory component develops later on,
based on the similarity component, or, alternatively, (b) that
the theory component is present from the start, but for some
reason (e.g. lack of adequate prior knowledge) does not
influence young children’s inductive generalizations, which
are based on similarity judgments instead (for example,
Carey, 1985).
In the present paper we will not be concerned with this
debate in itself. Rather, we will assume that at some point
children construct domain-specific conceptual knowledge
which is theory-based. The purpose of our research is to
investigate whether there is evidence for theory change in
the development of children’s categorizations.
More specifically, Vosniadou and her colleagues (e.g.
Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992; 1994; Vosniadou, Skopeliti, &
Ikospentaki, 2004; in press) have argued that the main

reason why children have difficulty understanding the
spherical shape of the earth is because they spontaneously
categorize the earth as a physical object (rather than as a
solar object) and apply to it all the presuppositions that
apply to physical objects in general (i.e. solidity, stability,
up/down organization of space, up/down gravity, etc., see
Spelke, 1991). There has been indirect evidence for the
existence of such presuppositions from children’s verbal
explanations and representations (drawings and play-dough
models). Several cross-cultural studies that were conducted
in Samoa, India, Greece, and native Indian-American
children in South Dakota showed that children in different
parts of the world form models of the earth that reveal these
presuppositions of solidity and stability ( Samarapungavan,
Vosniadou, & Brewer, 1996; Vosniadou, Archontidou,
Kalogiannidou, & Ioannides, 1996; Diakidoy, Vosniadou, &
Hawks, 1997). However, the hypothesis that children
categorize the earth as a physical object has not been
investigated directly.
The research reported in this paper examined 1st and 5th
graders categorizations of the earth in relation to their
beliefs about the shape of the earth. We hypothesized that
by grade 1 most children will have formed the distinction
between solar and physical objects and that they will tend to
categorize the earth as a physical object. Further, we
expected a developmental shift in children’s theory-based
categorizations of the earth from the earth as a physical
object to the earth as a solar object. We also hypothesized a
high correlation between children’s categorizations and their
beliefs about the shape of the earth. According to our theory,
the shift from categorizing the earth as a physical object to
categorizing it as a solar object should be a prerequisite to a
full understanding of the spherical shape of the earth.

Method
Participants
The sample consisted of 62 Greek children, students in two
middle-class schools of central Athens. Forty-three of them
attended 1st grade and their age ranged from 6 to 7 years

2325

(Mean age 6 years and 3 months) and 19 of them attended
5th grade and their age ranged from 10 to 11 years (Mean
age 10 years and 5 months).

Procedure
The children were interviewed individually in a separate
classroom in their school by two experimenters. One
experimenter posed the questions and the other kept detailed
notes of children’s responses during the interview. In the
first part of the interview the children were given the
Categorization Task, which was followed after a 5 minutes
break by an astronomy (Earth Shape and Gravity)
Questionnaire. Each interview lasted approximately 25-30
minutes. The interviews were recorded and the scoring was
done on the transcribed data. Half of the data were scored by
two experimenters who agreed on the scoring key. Then,
two independent scorers used the key to score all the data.
Agreement was high (96%). All disagreements were
resolved after discussion.

Materials
The materials for the Categorization Task consisted of 10
cards with the words SUN, MOON, STAR, EARTH,
PLANET, HOUSE, CAT, ROCK, TREE and CAR. The
experimenter read the cards with the child and made sure
that she/he understood the meaning of each word. Then she
asked the child the three categorization questions that appear
on Table 1. Each categorization question was followed by a
justification question (Why did you put these things
together?) as shown in Table 2. The Earth Shape and
Gravity Questionnaire was administered last. It was based
on the Vosniadou & Brewer (1992) Astronomy
Questionnaire and appears on Table 3.

Results
Categorization Task
Children’s responses to the three categorization questions
were grouped in four main categories: (1) Distinguishes
solar from physical objects (either in two or more categories
in the case of the first question) and groups the earth with
the solar objects, (2) Distinguishes solar from physical
objects (either in two or more categories in the case of the
first question) and groups the earth with the physical
objects, (3) Does not distinguish solar from physical objects,
and (4) No response.
Children’s responses to all the categorization questions
were marked as 3 for the categorization of the earth as a
solar object, 2 for the categorization of the earth as a
physical object, 1 when the child made no distinction
between solar and physical objects, and 0 when there was no
response. The total scores were subjected in an one way
ANOVA which, as expected, showed main effects for grade
(F(1,60)=18,487, p<.001) in favor of the 5th graders (1st
grade mean score: 5,605; 5th grade mean score: 8,185).
A chi-square was also used to compare 1st and 5th graders
final categorizations of the earth. This analysis showed
statistically significant results in favor of the 5th graders
[x2(2)= 11,630, p<.005]. The categorization differences
between the 1st and 5th graders’ responses in the last
categorization question can be seen more clearly in Figure 1.
Unlike the 1st graders, practically all the 5th graders
distinguished physical from solar objects and categorized
the earth with the solar.

Children’s justifications were also grouped in four
categories as shown in Table 2: (1) Theory-based, if the
child referred to the distinction between solar and physical
objects (eg. All these are planets and they are found on the
sky. The others are found down here.), (2) Similarity-based,
if the child referred to functional similarity or similarity in
shape, brightness or position, (eg. All these have the same
shape (round) but the others have different shapes), (3)
Arbitrary, if the child mentioned idiosyncratic grounds for
the categories (e.g., the cat goes with the tree because cats
like climbing trees), and (4) No response.
Children’s responses to the justification questions were
marked as 3 for the theory-based responses, 2 for the
similarity-based responses, 1 for arbitrary justifications, and
0 when there was no response. The total scores were
subjected to an one way ANOVA which showed main
effects for grade [F(1,60)=7,670, p<.01] in favor of the 5th
graders (1st grade mean score: 6; 5th grade mean score:
7,632).

Question 1

As can be seen in Table 2, children start by giving
justifications that belong to all the previously mentioned
categories but, by the end of the interview, they give mainly
theory-based justifications. In other words they say that they
grouped the objects following the physical/solar objects
distinction. A close examination of the data showed that all
the children who placed the earth either with the solar or
with the physical objects gave a theory-based justification,
with the exception of one 1st grader who grouped the earth
with the solar and gave an arbitrary justification.
A chi-square that compared 1st and 5th graders’ final
justifications showed statistically significant results [x2(2) =
6,575, p<.05]. This difference can be seen more clearly in
Figure 2 where we compare children’s responses to the last
justification question.

Earth Shape and Gravity Task
Table 3 shows children’s responses in all the earth shape
and gravity questions. Children’s responses to all the earth
shape and gravity questions were marked as 3 for responses
consistent with the scientifically expected answer (spherical
shape of the earth with people living all over its surface,
etc.), 1 for responses consistent with an initial flat model of
earth (flat model of the earth and people living only on the
top of the model, etc.) 2 for responses consistent with an
alternative model of the earth (neither spherical, nor flat),
and as 0 when there was no response to the question asked.
The way the responses were scored can be seen in more
details in Table 3. The total scores of these marks were
subjected in an one way ANOVA which showed main
effects for grade [F(1,60)=11,003, p<.005]. The frequency
of the scientifically correct responses increased with age and
thus the 5th graders had a higher mean score (17,684)
compared to the 1st graders (13,372).
The earth shape and gravity questions were scored
following the procedures described in Vosniadou & Brewer
(1992) and the children were assigned to earth shape models
using their responses to four questions as described in
Vosniadou, Skopeliti, & Ikospentaki (2004). The four

earth, Q3 about the people living at the bottom of the
spherical earth, Q6 about the end of the earth, and Q7 about
the people falling from the end of the earth. Table 4 shows
the frequency and percent of children placed in scientific,
alternative, and initial models of the earth in relation to their
final categorization.

An examination of Table 4 shows a high correlation
between categorization responses and earth shape models.
Most of the 1st graders with initial models of the earth
categorized the earth as a physical object, while the great
majority of the 5th graders and the 1st graders with spherical
earth models categorized the earth as a solar object. In fact,
there were only three children who constructed a spherical
model of the earth and who did not, at the same time,
categorize the earth with the solar objects.

The correlation between categorizations and earth shape
models was statistically significant, rs= 0.444; n=62;
p<0.001. It appears that the theory-shift from earth as a
physical to earth as a solar object precedes children’s full
understanding of the earth as a spherical object and
constitutes almost a necessary, although not sufficient,
condition for the spherical earth model.

categorization shift may be a prerequisite for a full
understanding of the scientific explanation of the earth.
The results of the research presented in this paper open up
new ways of viewing the relationship between conceptual
development and categorization and have important
implications for the diagnosis of students’ misconceptions in
science as well as for instruction.

Discussion

Acknowledgments

The results of the categorization task are not conclusive with
respect to the debate between similarity-based vs. theorybased accounts (Keil et al., 1998). Children from both
grades, but particularly the 1st graders, distinguished solar
from physical objects and categorized the earth either as a
solar object or as a physical object. Or, they did not
distinguish solar from physical objects and categorized the
earth on other grounds. Their justifications were either
theory-based, similarity-based, or arbitrary. Nevertheless,
the developmental differences in the categorizations of the
1st graders compared to the 5th graders, and particularly the
differences in the last question of the categorization task in
which they were asked explicitly to make two groups with
“the things that go with the earth and the things that do not”
clearly support our hypothesis for a shift from one theorybased to another theory-based categorization. At grade 1,
35% of the children categorized the earth as a physical
object and 42% as a solar object (providing appropriate
theory-based justifications), while at grade 5 only 1 child
categorized the earth as a physical object and all others
(90%) as a solar object (again, providing appropriate theorybased justifications). These results agree with previous
arguments about theory-based changes in children’s
conceptual knowledge (eg. Carey, 1985, Chi, 1992).
The predicted theory-change in children’s categorizations
are consistent with claims by Vosniadou and colleagues
(Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992; Vosniadou, 1994) that
children’s difficulties in understanding the spherical shape
of the earth can be explained by assuming that children
categorize the earth as a physical object and apply to it all
the presuppositions that apply to physical objects in general.
Presuppositions such as solidity, stability, up/down gravity,
etc., can stand on the way of understanding the spherical
shape of the earth. The results of the present experiment also
provide further support to the hypothesis that the
