   In choosing a paradigm for studying information
dissemination, we sought to find a case with: 1) a problem
to solve with answers that varied continuously on a
quantitative measure of quality, 2) a problem search space
that was sufficiently large that no individual could cover it
all in a reasonable amount of time, and 3) simple
communications between participants that would be
amenable to computational modeling. We settled upon a
minimal search task in which participants guess numbers
between 0 – 100 and the computer tells them how many
points were obtained from the guess. There was a
continuous function that related the guesses to the points
earned, but this function was not revealed to the
participants. The participants received information on their
own guesses and earned points, as well as obtained                 Figure 2: Examples of the a) unimodal and b) multimodal

guesses form 0 - 100 into 20 bins of 5 points each.
   While the average number of rounds before any single
individual reached the global maximum did not differ
between network structures for the unimodal function, the
lattice network had a significantly smaller percentage of
people (M = 0.66) within the global maximum than all of
the other networks (full: M = 0.82; small: M = 0.80;
random: M = 0.77) (F(3,50) = 4.191, p = 0.01), which is
most likely due to the longer average path lengths and thus
slower spread of information through the network.
   This is supported by examination of the percentage of
participants within one standard deviation of the global
maximum after each round. As can be seen in Figure 3a,
the fully connected, small-world, and random networks have
almost 80% of participants in the global maximum by
Round 3, while the lattice network does not reach this level         b)
until round nine, and never reaches the percentages the other
networks attain. Additionally, the low average relative
entropy of the lattice network (M = 1.43, SD = 0.42)
compared to all of the other networks (full: M = 1.71, SD =
0.36; small: M = 1.61, SD = 0.45; random: M = 1.71, SD =
0.41) indicates that the distribution of guesses in the lattice
network was typically less clustered than for the other
networks (F(3, 791) = 17.259, p < 0.001).
   In the multimodal landscape we again expect shorter path
lengths to correspond with faster convergence on the global
maximum, but we anticipate that lack of spatial structure
could lead to less exploration, and thus early convergence
on a local maxima and a slower convergence on the global
maximum.
   As predicted, the average number of steps for the first
person to reach the global maximum was significantly less            Figure 3: Percent of participants within 1 standard deviation
