 paradoxes denote equivalence classes of models. Only
 models which are preferred for some factual situation are
 given. The dashed box collects those equivalence classes
 which pertain directly to the fact of the matter (given
 by the satisfaction of k within a class), and is informally
 called “zooming in” on the facts. The preference order-
 ing runs from left to right, with the leftmost set of mod-

 standard deontic logic. Instead of all non-ideal situations
 being clumped together into one equivalence class, they
