Research in neurocomputing is interested in developing
formal models that integrate findings across a number of
fields, including cognitive sciences, neurophysiology,
linguistics, mathematics, and computer science. A key issue
in developing such models is to combine known anatomical
structures with mathematical descriptions of the
