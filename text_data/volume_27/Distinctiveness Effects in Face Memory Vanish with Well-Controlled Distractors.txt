Face-space explanation
As mentioned earlier, the distribution of typical and
distinctive faces in face space should have consequences on
the set-wise distances between distractors and the two types
of targets (see Valentine, 1991). In particular, we should
expect randomly chosen distractors to be on the whole
closer to a set of typical faces than to a set of distinctive
faces. To show this, we simulated random sets of faces
researchers might use in a standard face memory experiment
and compared the relevant distances in face space. In each
simulation, we sampled 30 typical and 30 distinctive faces,
and 30 random distractor faces from one of two versions of
face space: a silhouette-like face space with 16 dimensions,            Figure 4. Mean distance from distractors to target faces.

faces (all differences significant to p < .01). The results of
these simulations support the notion that distinctive faces
may elicit more hits and fewer false alarms because they are
more distinguishable from the distractors. The conclusion
leaves open the question of whether distinctive faces would
still be more memorable than typical faces if these
differences were somehow eliminated. In the next study, we
address this question by constructing equally-spaced
distractors for each target silhouette.

better at discriminating between faces in dense, over-learned
regions of face space. This interpretation would be
consistent with reports of an own-race advantage in face
recognition (e.g., Tanaka, Kiefer, & Bukach, 2004).
However, there is an alternative explanation for our finding.
It is possible that participants developed specific strategies
for recognizing silhouettes during the course of the
experiment, and that this learning was biased toward typical
silhouettes. As shown schematically in Figure 6, the region
of silhouette face space occupied by the set of typical target
silhouettes observed during the experiment is smaller and
more dense than the region occupied by the set of distinctive
silhouettes. Because the silhouettes are embedded in a 16-
dimensional space, these differences are actually more
pronounced than is apparent in the diagram.
