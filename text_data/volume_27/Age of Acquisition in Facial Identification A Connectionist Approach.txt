              Experiment 1: Natural AoA
Our first experiment models a facial identification task
using a simple feedforward neural network. Neither
frequency manipulation nor pattern staging is used in this
experiment, allowing the faces to be acquired in their
natural order. All of the faces in the training set are
introduced at the beginning of training and are presented
once per epoch. We carry out multiple replications on
different networks to simulate replicating a human study
over multiple subjects. The training process is identical for
each replication, differing only on the initial random
weights and the random presentation of the faces. We see if         Figure 2: Female and male subject with the following facial

Late set output units are not trained during presentation of
the early set. Therefore, the weights between the hidden
layer and these output units remain unchanged.
Additionally, these units have no effect in the calculation of
the early set’s SSE. During the second half of training when
the late set is introduced, the network receives feedback
from all the output units as usual. The same staging of face
presentation is used from Experiment 2, except training lasts
for a total of 250 epochs. As it turns out, these networks
actually require longer to learn. Therefore, there are 125
epochs with the early set presented once per epoch. Another
125 epochs follow with the early set presented once per
epoch and the late set presented twice per epoch. As we
describe below, there are no AoA effects at the end of 250
epochs. To check the strength of this result, we add a
recency control by training for another 50 epochs in which
both early and late sets are presented once per epoch.
Otherwise, the model is identical to the one used in
