                         Experiment 1
Six conditions are included, varying in the kind of
information presented during training. In five of these
conditions, a triple of items was presented on each trial. In the
aAA condition, both context items match the category of the
target item ‘a’; in the aAB condition, one context item
matches the category of the target item and one does not; in
the aBB condition, both context items are from the same
category which differs from the target item’s category; in the
aBC condition, all three items are from different categories;
and in the aXX condition, the context items are random with
respect to category. A single item control (SIC) condition was
structured in the same way as the aXX condition, but each
item was presented one at a time.
   One possible learning strategy is to locate common features
between items known to belong to the same category and
perform abstraction, in which case the aAA condition should                     Figure 1: Sample stimuli for Experiment 1.
