strong cell samples were more likely to be healthy than
those with weak cell samples. Although cell strength was
an imperfect indicator of health, the doctor tried to optimize
his decisions. Within this cover story, the word condition
also had relational labels for el ements of the story. Healthy
athletes were labeled target and the unhealthy athlet es were
distracters. Those that the doctor deemed “healthy” were
labeled “target” with the quotation marks around both the
contextual term and the relational term indicating that this is
only the doctor’s decision rather than the actual status of the
athlete. Hit, miss, correct rejection, and false alarm were
also included in the word condition’s tutorial. Other than
the addition of the labels, the tutorials for the word and

                        Experiment 2
Method
Forty undergraduates were randomly assigned in a similar
paradigm of learning SDT as Experiment 1. The main
departure from Experiment 1 was a change in the tutorial’s
cover story. In the new story the doctor is trying to
diagnose leukemia patients by examining blood samples.
People with distorted cell samples are more likely to have
leukemia than those with pure cell samples. Although cell
distortion is an imperfect indicator of leukemia, the doctor
must try to optimize his decisions.
                                                                        Figure 2: This shows the underlying structure of the SDT
