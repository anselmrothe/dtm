   As expected, during the Transfer Phase the two groups
that did not switch button mode (colB-colB and noColB-
noColB) continued using the same set of interactive routines
they used in the button phase. Likewise, the group that
switched from noColumn-Button to Column-Button
(noColB-colB) immediately switched interactive routines to
become statistically indistinguishable from the colB-colB
condition. However, a stranger pattern is shown by the
group that trained with column buttons but transferred to the
noColumn-Button mode (colB-noColB). This group does
not budge. Rather than adopting the by-row interactive
routines used by the noColB-noColB group, this group is as
constant in their use of by-column interactive routines
during transfer as they were during training.
