(SOAs) are longer than 200-300 ms, an inhibition effect is
observed (IOR; performance on invalid trials is better than
performance on valid trials) (Posner & Cohen, 1984).
Facilitation effects are often interpreted consistently with
the hypothesis that on valid trials cues have involuntary
captured attention and then targets appear on the location
currently “illuminated” by the attentional spotlight.
Differently, inhibition effects are explained consistently
with the hypothesis that attentional focus is more probably
located on locations that are not recently scanned (Klein,
2000).
Even though such effects are very often interpreted as
caused by spatial orienting of attention, they seem to be
analogous to first order sequential effects usually observed
in two-choice tasks (Bertelson, 1961; Soetens, 1998). An
extensive number of two-choice task experiments have
showed that reaction time (RT) to a stimulus is dependent
not only on that stimulus but also on the sequence of
preceding stimuli. Influences caused by the previous
stimulus-response cycle are called “first order sequential
effects”, while influences caused by earlier cycles are called
“higher order sequential effects”. Similarly to cueing
experiments, in two-choice tasks the sequential effects
mainly depend on response-stimulus intervals (RSI). Infact,
first order repetition effects are usually observed with
relatively short RSIs (less than 500 ms); whereas, first order
alternation effects are observed with relatively long RSIs
(i.e., RTs are faster to a different stimulus than to a repeated
stimulus). While repetition effects are often explained in
terms of an automatic facilitation caused by a residual
activation of memory traces, alternation effects are
associated to a kind of subjective expectancy. More
specifically, in a series of binary stimuli subjects seem to
expect more alternations than repetitions; this phenomenon
is well known as “gambler’s fallacy” and it is often
explained in terms of an erroneous representation of
randomness and probability (Nickerson, 2002) based on
what Tversky and Kahneman (1971) called “law of small
numbers” (which is the erroneous belief that proprieties of

Abstract
Spatial cueing is a largely used experimental paradigm to
study exogenous attention orienting, both in behavioural and
neurological research. In such a paradigm participants are
presented a sequence of trials that are assumed to be
independent from each other. In each trial a peripheral spatial
cue is presented, followed by a target peripheral stimulus;
subjects are required to respond as fast as possible to targets,
attempting to ignore cues. In such experiments RTs are
mainly dependent to trial type (valid vs invalid) and to Cuetarget intervals (short vs long). The present study aims at
investigating the hypothesis that facilitation and inhibition
effects, observed in cueing experiments, can be considered
analogous to sequential effects, usually observed in twochoice tasks, and then that all these effects can be explained
by the very same cognitive mechanisms. Results from two
cueing experiments support this theoretical explanation and
highlight the relevance of taking into account sequential
effects.

Introduction
In the study of visuospatial attention endogenous and
exogenous control modalities are recognized. Probably,
spatial cueing is the most used experimental paradigm to
investigate the mechanisms and characteristics of both
voluntary and automatic attention orienting (Posner, 1980).
In such a simple paradigm a sequence of trials is
administered to the subjects; each trial consists of two
consecutive events: the presentation of a spatial cue
followed by the presentation of a target stimulus, to which
subjects are required to respond as fast as possible. To study
the exogenous modality, usually cues are peripheral stimuli
that are unpredictably presented on the same location of the
following target or on a different location. While in the
former case the trial is called “valid”, in the latter case the
trial is called “invalid”. Typically, when the intervals
between cues and targets (SOAs) are shorter than 200-300
ms, a facilitation effect is observed (performance on valid
trials is better than performance on invalid trials); on the
contrary, when the intervals between cues and targets

adjustable chin rest. Participants were instructed to maintain
their gaze on the fixation point at all times during each
experimental session. Moreover, they were required to press
a button as rapidly as possible in response to each target,
regardless of its location (detection task). They were also
informed that the visual cue was not predictive of the
location of the incoming target, so they had to try to ignore
that kind of stimulus. After instructions, a practice session
was run, that lasted until the subject had made 20
consecutive correct responses. The experiment consisted of
11 blocks of about 192 trials each, and a rest period was
always offered between them. Each target-present trial
began with a fixation display containing the central cross;
after 500 ms a cue was superimposed for all the trial
duration. After a variable time ranging from 50 to 150 ms
(SOA), the target appeared until a response was given or for
800 ms. Catch trials were identical to previous ones, but no
targets occurred. Sequences of three trials were randomized
within each block by the computer.

large samples will also apply to very small samples).
Moreover, as Roney and Trick (2003) show, gambler’s
fallacy occurs as a result of a natural tendency for people to
organize separate and independent events into larger units.
The aim of the present study is to reconcile the two
briefly outlined research traditions by investigating higher
order effects in exogenous spatial cueing. Specifically, it is
suggested that in spatial cueing trials can not be considered
independent, and therefore facilitation and inhibition effects
are influenced by trials sequences. Moreover, a possibility
arises to consider such cueing effects as dued to automatic
facilitation and subjective expectancy, respectively.
Therefore, two exogenous spatial cueing experiments were
run manipulating: a) cue-target intervals (SOAs); b)
sequences of trials (as suggested by Soetens, Boer and
Hueting, 1985).

Experiment 1
The present experiment aimed at investigating the effects of
preceding trials in an exogenous spatial cueing paradigm in
which the intervals between cues and targets (SOAs) were
shorter than 200 msec. As the literature suggests, short
SOAs tend to produce a facilitation effect for which RTs
recorded on valid trials are faster than those recorded on
invalid trials. As mentioned above, facilitation effect is
usually explained in terms the capability of the cue to
involuntary actract attentional focus.

Design In 960 trials cue appeared on the same location of
the target (valid trials); more specifically, in 480 valid trials
cue and target appeared on the left position and in 480 valid
trials cue and target appeared on the right position. In 960
trials cue appeared on a location different from the target
one (invalid trials); more specifically, in 480 invalid trials
cue appeared on the left and target on the right of the
fixation point and in 480 invalid trials cue appeared on the
right and target on the left of the fixation point. Finally, in
192 trials target did not appear (Catch trials).
To study higher sequential effects in spatial cueing, valid
and invalid trials were grouped in sequences of three. Since
the inter-trial interval was always the same, subjects had no
ways to perceive grouping. Considering the two possible
locations of cues and targets there were 64 possible
sequences. Consequently each sequence was presented 10
times in random order and only RTs recorded on the third
trial were considered for the statistical analyses on
sequential effects. Following Soetens, Boer and Hueting
(1985), each sequence can be described in terms of
Alternations (A) and Repetitions (R) of two consecutive
stimuli. In the present experiment two consecutive stimuli
can be either the cue and the target of a single trial (in this
case an Alternation corresponds to an invalid trial and a
Repetition corresponds to a valid trial) or the target and the
cue of two consecutive trials. Therefore an Alternation
consists of the presentation of two stimuli that differ for the
spatial dimension (for example, the first stimulus is
presented on the left location and the second one on the
right location); differently, a Repetition consists of the
presentation of two stimuli that do not differ for the spatial
dimension (for example, both stimuli are presented on the
left location). In table 1 all possible A/R sequences are
presented; in table 2 the stimuli specifications for the two
trial sequences that can be both described by the A/R
sequence N. 7 are given. More in general, the sequences 1-

Method
Subjects A total of 10 individuals were recruited to
participate in the experiment. Their man age was 24.2,
ranging from 22 to 28 years. All of them were
undergraduate students and reported normal or corrected-tonormal vision. All participants reported to be right handed,
and were naives to the purpose of the experiment.
Apparatus The experiment was conducted on 19’’ SGI
monitor controlled by a Windows compatible PC.
Programming was done using SuperLab 2.01, which
controlled display parameters and registered RTs. The
screen resolution was 1024x768. Subjects responded via a
one-button response pad connected to the Serial Port.
Stimuli The fixation point was a white cross subtending a
visual angle of 0.8°, located at the center of the display.
Spatial Cues were outlined grey circles (2.5°). Target
stimuli were solid grey circles (1.5°). Cues and targets could
appear either on the left or on the right of the fixation point
at a distance of 5.2°. The background was black. The choice
of the stimuli was made following the results of Pratt, Hillis
and Gold (2001) on the effects of the physical
characteristics of cues and targets on facilitation and
inhibition.
Procedure Subjects were run individually in a silent and
darkened room; they were seated about 40 cm in front of a
computer monitor, placed straight ahead with its centre at

16 end with an invalid trial (as it is indicated by the last
“A”), the sequences 17-32 end with a valid trial (as it is
indicated by the last “R”). Statistical analyses are performed
comparing RTs to last Alternation (Invalid trial) and RTs to
last Repetition (Valid Trial) in function of all combinations
of four previous As and Rs.
In general, it is expected that facilitation effect (RTs to
valid trials faster than RTs to invalid trials) usually observed
in spatial cueing at short SOAs is significantly modulated
by trials sequences.

Results
Subjects missed the targets on less than 1% of the targetpresent trials and made false alarms on less than 3% of the
catch trials. RTs of less than 100 ms were excluded as
anticipations and accounted for less than 1% of all
observations. The mean RT for correct responses was
calculated for each subject for each cell of the design.
Preliminarily, mean RTs were analyzed with a 2 (trial type:
valid, invalid) X 2 (target location: left, right) repeated
measure analysis of variance. Only a main effect was found
for location (F1,9=5.485, p<0.05), with slower RTs in the
right condition (see Table 3).

In order to understand the interaction effect, a post-hoc test
(Duncan) was performed. Results showed that the
facilitation effect was significant only for some A/R
sequences: RARA (p=.001), RAAR (p=.002), RARR
(p=.003), ARRR (p=.006), RRRR (p=.030). Moreover, a
significant inhibition effect (valid trials RTs slower than
invalid trials RTs) was observed for the sequence AAAA
(p=.001).Finally, considering separately valid and invalid
trials, post-hoc comparisons showed that mean RTs were
largely dependent to the specific A/R sequence considered.
For example, RTs recorded on those valid trials preceded by
the sequences RARA and RAAR, were significantly faster
than RTs recorded on those valid trials preceded by the
sequences AAAA, ARAA, RRAA (p<.05 for all cases). In a
similar way, RTs recorded on those invalid trials preceded
by the sequences RARA, ARRA, and RARR were
significantly slower than RTs recorded on those invalid
trials preceded by the sequences AAAA, RAAA, and
ARAA (p<.01 for all cases). Figure 1 shows mean RTs to
valid and invalid trials for each combination of four As and
Rs.

concerned the stimuli presentation timing (see following
Procedure sections).
Subjects A total of 10 undergraduate students were
recruited to participate in the experiment. Their man age
was 22.4, ranging from 20 to 25 years. All of them reported
normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Moreover, all
participants reported to be right handed, and were naives to
the purpose of the experiment.
Procedure Each target-present trial began with a fixation
display containing the central cross; after 500 ms a cue was
superimposed for 100 ms. Then, the fixation display was
presented again for a variable time, ranging from 500 ms to
1000 ms (SOA). After it, the target appeared for 30 ms.
Finally, a third fixation display appeared until a response
was given or for 800 ms.

Results
Subjects missed the targets on less than 2.5% of the targetpresent trials and made false alarms on less than 2% of the
catch trials. RTs of less than 100 ms were excluded as
anticipations and accounted for less than 2% of all
observations. The mean RT for correct responses was
calculated for each subject for each cell of the design.
Preliminarily, mean RTs were analyzed with a 2 (trial type:
valid, invalid) X 2 (target location: left, right) repeated
measure analysis of variance. Only a main effect was found
for type of trial (F1,9=131.44; p<0.0001), with slower RTs
for valid condition (see Table 4).

Discussion
Results of the preliminary analysis of variance failed to
show the typical facilitation effect, usually observed in such
paradigms. There can be some reasons for it. One simple
possibility is that the stimuli and/or the experimental
procedure were not suitable to highlight that kind of
attentional effect. This hypothesis can be discarded taking
into account the results of the second analysis of variance,
for which it is evident that facilitation effects exist, but only
for specific sequences of preceding trials. Considering that
this kind of effect is less stable than inhibition effect, that is
it is not always observed (Samuel & Kat, 2003), it is
possible to claim that facilitation effects, when observed, are
just dued to the experimental arrangement of trials.
Moreover, results from the second analysis of variance
demonstrated that even with short SOAs RTs in spatial
cueing can depend on the subjective expectancies generated
by preceding trials as it is highlighted by the inhibition
effect observed with sequence AAAA.

In order to examine sequential effects RTs were submitted
to a 2 (trial type: valid, invalid) X 16 (A/R sequence:
AAAA, RAAA, ARAA, RRAA, AARA, RARA, ARRA,
RRRA, AAAR, RAAR, ARAR, RRAR, AARR, RARR,
ARRR, RRRR) repeated measure analysis of variance.
Main effects were found for trial type (F1,9=89.038,
p<.0001), with faster RTs to invalid condition, and for A/R
sequence (F15,35=2.331, p<.01). Also the two-way
interaction trial type X A/R sequence was significant
(F15,135=3.945, p<.0001). In order to understand the
interaction effect, a post-hoc test (Duncan) was performed.

Experiment 2
The second experiment aimed at investigating the effects of
preceding trials in an exogenous spatial cueing paradigm in
which the intervals between cues and targets (SOA) were
longer than 200 msec. As the literature suggests, long SOAs
tend to produce an inhibition effect, usually called
Inhibition of Return (IOR), for which RTs recorded on valid
trials are slower than those recorded on invalid trials.

Method
The apparatus, stimuli, procedure and design were almost
identical to those for Experiment 1. The only difference

Results showed that the conventional inhibition effect (IOR,
valid trials RTs slower than invalid trials RTs), usually
observed in exogenous spatial cueing at long SOA, was
significant for all A/R sequences (p<0.001).
Finally, in order to examine a modulation of IOR in
function of A/R sequences, mean Inhibition Effects
(calculated by subtracting mean RTs to invalid trials from
mean RTs to valid trials) were submitted to an unvariate

repeated measure analysis of variance (A/R sequence:
AAAA, RAAA, ARAA, RRAA, AARA, RARA, ARRA,
RRRA, AAAR, RAAR, ARAR, RRAR, AARR, RARR,

(F15,135=3.945, p<.00001) and the post-hoc test showed that
some sequences produced larger IORs than others (for
details see Table 5).

Discussion
Results of the first analysis of variance showed as expected
the inhibition effect (IOR), usually observed with long
SOAs. The second and third analyses highlighted that even
if IOR seems more strong than facilitation effect it is largely
modulated by A/R sequences. Therefore, results of this
experiments suggest that size of IOR can be modulated by
subjective expectancies originating from preceding trials.
Nevertheless, we can not conclude that IOR is exclusively
dued to subjective expectancies related to representation of
randomness and probability.

General Discussion
The present study was aimed at investigating higher order
sequential effects in exogenous spatial cueing. The results of
experiment 1 and 2 suggest that facilitation and inhibition
effects can be significantly modulated by the specific
sequence of preceding stimuli and trials. From a
methodological point of view, the results suggest that the
assumption that trials in cueing paradigms are independent
it is not valid, and consequently that it is dangenorus to
think that simply randomizing trials prevent sequential
effects. It should be noted also that pseudo-random
generators usually used to randomize trials often are be
based on an implementation of the alternation bias.
From a theorethical point of view, it seems possible to
conclude that facilitation effects in short SOAs cueing
experiments can be more simply dued to higher order
sequential effects. Differently, this conclusion seems it is
not suitable for the inhibition effect (IOR) observed with
long SOAs, as in the second experiment IOR it is observed
for all the A/R sequences.
Future research should focus on a direct manipulation of
first order sequential effects in spatial cueing.
