that a sketch of what scene details lie beyond truncated
boundaries is continuously formed during picture viewing.
We suggest that when few background details are gathered
at initial viewing, the impoverished information leads to an
increase in the amount of visual content that is filled-in.
Second, given that the background is not well attended to in
these circumstances, errors between the extended image and
the original image will be far less apparent. The
combination of an overactive scene completion mechanism
with an inability to error-check the finished product may
result in increased amounts of boundary extension.
   In Experiment 2, we test this notion by examining
whether object salience can influence the magnitude of the
boundary extension effect. We hypothesize that very salient
foreground objects (such as faces) should give rise to still
more extension of image boundaries. This hypothesis is
based on our suggestion that the diversion of attentional
resources from the background to the foreground results in
increased activity of filling-in processes and a lower fidelity
representation of the background. We extend this attentional
account to suggest that making the background of a scene
more complex (and therefore interesting to the observer)
will counteract this phenomenon, leading to less boundary
extension. That is, when attention is drawn to the
background, a higher-fidelity representation of the scene is
maintained and there is less of a drive to generate additional
content due to increased viewing of the background.
                       Experiment 2
In this experiment, we adopt the same procedure employed             Figure 4: Example stimuli ranging from simple (top row) to
in Experiment 1 to investigate the effect of background and          complex (bottom row). We also display companion images
