things, attempted to model the learning curve (e.g., Newell
& Rosenbloom, 1981), examine the relationship between
abilities and performance (e.g., Ackerman, 1988), explore
patterns of inter-trial correlations (e.g., Jones, 1970) , and
develop cognitive architectures that simulate human
information processing (e.g., Anderson, 1982; Newel,
1990). These modeling issues reflect fundamental questions
about the nature of learning and how learning relates to
human cognitive processes and abilities. However, across
each of these modeling issues, there is a need to better
integrate an understanding of the role of strategy in order to
develop a more comprehensive theory of skill acquisition.
The focus of the present research is on integrating
strategy into the important theoretical frameworks
established within the human performance and skill
acquisition field. Some initial work has already been
conducted to examine the relationship between strategies
and learning curves (Delaney, Reder, Staszewski, & Ritter,
1998), ability-performance relationships (Keil & Cortina,
1999) and cognitive architectures (John & Lallement, 1997).
The present research aimed to develop these areas further by
measuring within the one study, abilities, strategic
orientation, task performance and strategy use over time. By
obtaining such rich data and using modern analytic
techniques, these traditional skill acquisition issues can be
enriched by the incorporation of strategy as a key variable
allowing new connections to be made.

Abstract
Adoption of efficient strategies and tactics in performing tasks
can have a profound impact on performance. The present
research aimed to incorporate strategies and tactics into
traditional models of skill acquisition, focusing on abilityperformance relationships and the learning curve. The study
involved 116 participants completing a series of ability tests
(general, perceptual speed and psychomotor) and performing
54 trials on a text editing task. For each trial, speed, accuracy
and strategy use were logged. Results showed that both
abilities and adoption of superior strategies made unique
contributions to predicting performance and that strategy
partially mediated the ability-performance relationship.
Performance and strategy use improved over time with
strategy use in later trials making an incremental prediction
on later trial performance over and above that of early trial
performance. Results went against theories predicting changes
in ability-performance correlations over time. Implications for
the development of cognitive architectures are also explored.

Introduction
Everyday, in work and non-work settings, people perform
tasks. People drive cars, prepare food, use computers, learn
new skills, and engage in a series of activities involving
various forms of skilled behavior. At an abstract level the
very nature of cognition can be seen as goal directed
information processing behavior involving the performance
of tasks. Within most tasks, substantial differences exist
between individuals on their level of performance as defined
by such measures as speed and quality. Underlying such
differences in task performance are differences in the
methods and strategies of task execution. When driving
home in peak hour, some people will be better able to
predict the fastest route; when arranging the dishwasher,
some people will arrange the dishes in a way that will speed
up the loading and unloading; when preparing a Power
Point presentation, some people will have tricks to automate
the formatting of slides. Strategies are inextricably linked
with human daily functioning and have substantial
implications for individual, organizational and national
efficiency.
Despite just over 100 years of research on skill
acquisition (see Bryan & Harter, 1899) and human
performance, strategies and other process variables, such as
motivation and task mental models, have been relatively
neglected within the skill acquisition literature (see eg.,
Langan-Fox, Armstrong, Balvin, Anglim, 2002 for a
description). Over this time researchers have, among other

Strategy and ability performance relationships
The issue of predicting performance on tasks from abilities
has been a popular and contentious topic in psychology.
Proctor and Dutta (1995) note that one concept common in
this area, although not undisputed, is that the importance of
particular abilities varies based on the demands of the task.
This was first extensively assessed by Fleishman (1972)
who proposed that as task demands change as a skill is
acquired from high demands on cognitive resources to
automated behavior, so would the relationships between
abilities and performance. The basic design of Fleishman’s
studies was to administer a battery of ability tests and then
record performance on a criterion task over several trials
and examine the pattern of ability-performance correlations
over time. Ackerman (1988) further refined a theory of
ability performance correlations suggesting that general,
perceptual speed and psychomotor abilities would have
differential prediction as a skill was acquired. However,
while individual differences in abilities are important in
predicting performance, differences in strategy use
145

6) Strategy use in later trials would lead to incremental
prediction of performance in later trials over and beyond
earlier trial performance

frequently account for even greater variability in
performance.
Performing a re-analysis of Ackerman’s (1988)
performance data, Lee, Anderson and Matessa (1995)
showed that strategy use accounted for 87.7% of variance in
task performance. They suggested that performance
increases were the result of both strategy improvements and
increased speed with which particular strategies were
executed. Any model of learning needs to incorporate both
speed of execution and strategy shifts. However, Lee et al
did not go on to report the relationship between strategy
usage, performance and the ability measures used by
Ackerman to measure performance.
From the analysis of this data Lee, Anderson, and
Matessa (1995) drew several conclusions regarding strategy
use: strategies reflect bounded rationality; individuals
frequently changed strategies but rarely regressed to an
inferior strategy; shifts were either gradual or abrupt;
performance was predicted by knowledge of a superior
strategy rather than the total number of strategies known;
While the movement towards automaticity as typified by
increases in speed of execution is important for improving
performance, strategy use was also important.
Importantly for the present research, Lee, Anderson, and
Matessa (1995) highlighted the utility of extracting strategy
use from key log data on computer-based tasks. This
approach allowed for the trial-by-trial monitoring of
strategy usage and strategy shifts over time. This research
also showed the importance of expanding research into
individual differences in task performance to include
differences in methods of task execution.
Thus it can be asserted that: first, strategies for
performing tasks are an important consideration when
understanding ability-performance relations; second,
strategy use typically accounts for a substantial proportion
of variance depending on the task and how strategy is
defined; third, different strategies are likely to place
different demands on abilities and therefore change the
properties of the task; and fourth, people with different
abilities are likely to perform tasks in different ways.

Method
A sample of 116 participants performed the experiment.
Median age was 23 and contained 60.3% females, 29.7%
males. Due to issues of cheating, task non-completion and
software errors, 99 participants were included in final
analyses of strategy use.
For each ability construct three tests were selected in
order to obtain a valid measure of each. General, perceptual
speed and psychomotor ability tests were selected because
of proven factor loadings in past studies (Armstrong and
Langan-Fox, 2000). Selected tests also corresponded to
appropriate points on the speed-level dimension that
Ackerman (1988) extracted from a multidimensional scaling
of 31 reference test variables from Allison’s (1960) data.
To measure general ability, the Extended Range
Vocabulary, Inference and Cube Comparison Tests were
used (Ekstrom et al 1976). To measure perceptual speed
ability the Number Comparison, Number Sort (Ekstrom et
al 1976) and Clerical Speed and Accuracy tests (Bennet et al
1972) were used. Finally, to measure psychomotor ability,
Simple, 2-Choice and 4-Choice reaction time tests were
used (Anglim, 2000).
The primary performance task was derived from a study
by Armstrong and Langan-Fox (2000) examining
participants’ ability to acquire the skill of repeatedly editing
a passage of text. While the present task resembles that used
by Armstrong and Langan-Fox, the length of the text
passage was reduced to allow for a greater number of trials
to be completed. Additionally, real world text-editing keys
were used that allow for more advanced cut, paste and
selections operations. These keys include pressing shift and
a cursor to navigate the cursor between words instead of one
character at a time. Such short-cut keys allow for greater
variation in production strategies. The passage of text
chosen included three long sentences and seven broad
corrections. These involved deleting words, cutting and
pasting words, selecting passages of text, and inserting new
characters.
The text editing task involved one practice trial with no
time limit followed by three sets of 18 trials, which
amounted to a total of 54 performance trials. If the
participant did not complete the trial after 60 seconds, the
trial would end automatically. This ensured that all
participants completed the 54 trials in the required amount
of time.

Hypotheses
Based on the previous research the following hypotheses
were formulated:
1) Strategies and abilities would both make unique
contributions in predicting performance.
2) Strategy use would partially mediate the relationship
between abilities and performance.
3) Performance, accuracy and response time would improve
over time with progressively smaller improvements with
practice.
4) Use of measured strategies would be associated with
faster performance.
5) Adoption of measured strategies would increase over
time.

Results
For each trial five strategy variables were created. First, raw
key log files containing the sequence and timings of key
presses were imported into a database. From this database,
particular key combinations were extracted based on their
ability to identify potentially superior text editing strategies.
These strategies will be hereafter referred to by their number
146

as: 1) control & cursor – move cursor between words; 2)
control & shift & cursor – select word at a time; 3) home
and/or end keys – navigate directly to start end of line; 4)
typing versus cut paste strategy; and, 5) shift delete –
deletes entire word. An aggregate strategy use variable was
created by getting a total number of strategies used for the
trial.
Accuracy data was rated out of 12 based on the number of
correct changes that were made in the text. The measure of
accuracy was combined with trial response time (RT) to
create a variable that represented trial performance. This
measure of performance aimed to estimate the time it would
have taken a participant to complete the trial with complete
accuracy. The procedure for deriving the weights was based
on an optimal scaling procedure previously used by Azjen
(1991). For the purpose of assessing overall performance
and smoothing out random variation between trials, trial
performance measures and response times were aggregated
into three blocks (trials 1 to 18, 19 to 36, 37 to 54) based on
a simple average.

Figure 1 shows the progressive improvement over time in
average levels of performance (a measure of speed adjusted
for accuracy), speed and accuracy. It also shows that
improvements between trials were smaller over the course
of practice to the point at the end of practice where
performance appeared to have leveled off. Finally, it shows
that the adoption of strategies increased consistently over
time from a mean of 1.0 strategies out of 5 at trial 1 to 1.9
strategies by trial 54.

To examine whether later phase strategy use led to
incremental prediction on performance over earlier trials a
hierarchical regression was performed placing text editing
performance for time 3 as the dependent variable and time 1
as the predictor in the first step. Strategy use at time 3 was
added in the second step. Results showed a significant
increase in prediction when strategy use at time 3 was added
to the model, R2 change = .04, F (1, 95) = 21.1, p<.001 (see
Table 3). In contrast there was no significant incremental
prediction of time 3 performance by the three abilities over
and beyond time 1 performance, R2 change = .01, F(3, 92) =

Figure 2. The three abilities were theorized to be correlated
and predict both performance and strategy use. Strategy use
was expected to be a direct predictor of performance, but
also partially mediate the relationship between abilities and
performance. Performance and strategy use at time one was
hypothesized to mediate the influence of abilities on time
two and time three. Strategy use at later phases was
predicted to have additive predictive value on performance
over and above prior performance.
A Generalized Least Squares estimation procedure was
used, because Maximum Likelihood resulted in estimation
problems. It should be noted that the sample size used for
the analyses is on the low end for performing structural
equation modeling, which may mean among other things
that the model is less replicable and that the chi-square test
is more optimistic regarding model fit. Model Fit statistics
show that the model provided a reasonable fit for the data,
Chi-Square (df = 80, n = 97) = 105.0, p = .03, RMSEA =
.057 (lower=0.18, higher = .085), GFI=.854. To guide
interpretation of the above values the following rules of
thumb may be used. An RMSEA below .05 is considered
very good fit, and below .08 reasonable, a GFI above .90 is
preferable, and holding sample size constant a less
significant chi-square is desirable.
However, it should be noted that the chi-square test is
stringent testing for exact congruence between model and
sample covariance matrices, and that typically the RMSEA
provides a better guide to whether the model is a good
representation of the data. An examination of the
standardized covariance residuals showed that the
measurement model for the ability tests could be slightly
refined.

Structural Equation Modeling
Structural Equation Modeling allows for the modeling of
correlations between a set of variables in a more integrated
way than traditional multivariate procedures. It allows for
the examination of mediational hypotheses, assessment of
measurement models and comparison of competing
theoretical models. In the present experiment structural
equation modeling allows for the examination of the
potential mediating role of strategy between abilities and
task performance. It also allows for examination of whether
the effect of abilities and strategies on later performance is
mediated by initial performance.
An initial confirmatory factor analysis was performed to
examine the measurement model of the three abilities. Tests
did tend to cluster well under the three hypothesized
abilities with the exception of one test that had some dual
loadings on general and perceptual speed ability.
A path diagram of the structural equation model of the
ability, strategy and task performance data is presented in

model supported the idea that future performance is best
predicted by past performance. The influence of abilities on
performance on later trials was mediated by performance on
earlier trials. Thus, there was no support for claims for
incremental increases in prediction of psychomotor ability
as set out by Ackerman (1988). In contrast strategy use in
later trials did lead to incremental prediction of later trial
performance over and above that predicted by performance
in earlier trials.
While it was clear that learning occurred on the task as
indicated by improvements in performance and strategy use,
individual differences remained quite stable between blocks
of time. Thus, people’s relative performance ranking did not
change substantially over time. Because of this, there is
little scope for changes in ability-performance relationships
over time. In this case a mediational relationship is more
meaningful whereby the effect of external variables such as
ability on later performance are accounted for by earlier
performance.
The particular pattern of performance correlations and
strategy correlations over time was consistent with the
notion of emergent change phenomena. This notion suggests
that correlations will be larger if the two time points are
closer in time. This is because changes emerge out of the
past state. Such an effect is likely to be stronger when
aggregate time points are considered, because they are more
reliable estimators of task performance than individual trials
which can be more influenced by random factors.
Results also have implications for the development of
cognitive architectures.

Table 4 shows the raw correlation matrix which when in
the form of a covariance matrix formed the basis of the
structural equation model. It can be seen that individual
differences in text editing performance and strategy use was
fairly stable over time. Correlations between time points are
larger when they are adjacent than between time point 1 and
3. Correlations between tests measuring abilities generally
reflected the idea that they were measuring unique
constructs. Each set of tests had relatively high internal
correlations between tests with the exception of the cube
comparison test which had relatively low correlations with
other general ability tests.

Discussion
The results showed that on the text editing task both abilities
and strategy use were important predictors of task
performance. All three ability constructs were related but
had differential prediction of text editing performance and
strategy use. In particular psychomotor ability was the
strongest predictor of text editing performance and strategy
use.
The particular pattern of prediction of abilities is likely
due to the nature of the task, which requires quick responses
on a computer. The task is also one where clear behavioral
based tactics can be specified and logged enabling strategy
use to be a substantial predictor.
Performance in terms of both speed and accuracy
improved over the course of practice. The pattern of
improvement was consistent with most skill acquisition
studies showing progressively smaller improvements over
time reaching an asymptote. Use of superior strategies also
increased over time. It is likely that performance
improvements resulted from a combination of the use of
more efficient strategies and smoother, more rapid
execution of particular techniques. The structural equation

differences (strategy) into cognitive architectures. It is
important to incorporate the differences between individuals
and the process by which strategies change over time. These
are likely to be related and depend on the task for their
interactions.
Several researchers have started to look at developing
models of learning that incorporate strategy shift over time
and how this interacts with performance. Simon and Halford
(1995) developed a model of strategy selection, where
strategies were selected based on strength of strategy.
Schunn has suggested that more research needs to be done
to answer the questions relating to the nature and causes of
strategy shifts and strategy adoption and that computational
modeling using ACT-R (Schunn & Anderson, 1998) and
other architectures such as Reder’s SAC (Source Activation
Confusion) model (Reder & Schunn, 1996) will help
explain these processes.
In terms of incorporating abilities and traits into models
of learning, Taatgen (2001) has attempted to develop an
ACT-R simulation of the Kanfer-Ackerman’s Air-Traffic
Control Task that incorporated the individual difference
measures of ability in the study. Hudlicka (2002) has also
developed a symbolic cognitive architecture that
incorporated personality characteristics (traits) and transient
emotions (states) as parameters that influence agent
behavior.
One argument made here is that the two modeling issues
of strategy shift and ability-performance relationships are
related. One of the ways abilities can predict performance is
that people who are higher on abilities are able to apply and
learn superior strategies. Thus, collecting data from human
participants provides a test for the effectiveness of cognitive
simulations attempt to model such processes.
