Our everyday life consists of various events we experience

these events has a number of subevents. These subevents are                    FINISH

valued certainty levels shown in Figure 3. The s-function
defines a membership, or certainty curve, over some time
range x. In the s-function, β serves as the inflection point,

the perception of whether the event is occurring or not
occurring), and α and γ define beginnings and ends of the
event interval where their certainty ranges from 0
