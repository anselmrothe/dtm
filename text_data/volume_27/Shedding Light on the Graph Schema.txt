                          Introduction
When looking at Figure 1a and attempting to read-off the
number of Widgets in Tray B, how does one have the
necessary knowledge to be able interpret this specific type of
graph? Given the large number of graph types (e.g. bar, line,
dot, scatter, box plot, etc.) and the fact that the same symbol
can represent completely different information in each of
these graph types, how do we activate and use the
information specific to each graph type? For example, the
“dot” in a scatter plot as compared to the “dot” in a box plot
mean very different things and in order to be able to interpret
these different graph types, we have to be able to activate the
appropriate knowledge.
  The current theories of graph comprehension solve this
problem by positing a “graph schema.” Pinker (1990)
suggests it is the graph schema that allows us to recognize
specific types of graphs and allows us to find the desired
information in a graph. Lohse (1993) suggests that the graph
schema contains standard, learned procedures for locating
information in the graph. Thus, when reading-off specific
information from a graph, the current theories would suggest

Procedure
The order in which the five conditions were presented to each
participant was randomly assigned according to a Latin
squares design. The stimuli were presented to the participants
over the computer. Each participant was instructed to respond
to the number of Widgets in Tray B when viewing a graph,
and to respond to the number in the sentence when viewing a
sentence, by entering the numerical value into the computer
by using the keypad on the keyboard. Before each condition,
the participant performed three practice trials to ensure they
understood the graph type, the interface, and the task. Each
participant was instructed to go through each graph or text as
quickly and accurately as possible. Once the participant
entered the value, the next stimulus automatically appeared                Figure 2. Average reaction times and difference scores.

since dot charts are very atypical, they should have a different
representation than the line graphs. Based on this view, in the
dot (mixed dot/line) condition, the dot chart representation
must be activated each time the dot chart appears, whereas in
the dot (pure) condition this representation should remain
activated. Thus, participants should be faster at responding in
the dot (pure) condition as compared to the dot (mixed
dot/line) condition, indicating that line graphs do not activate
dot charts.
  The general graph schema view would suggest there should
be no mixing costs between these two different graph types;
participants should be equally fast in the pure graph
conditions as they are in the mixed graph conditions. Since all
graph types rely on the same graph representation, it should
be equally activated, and there should be no differences
between conditions. If no mixing costs are found between the
pure graph conditions and the mixed graph conditions, this
would be further evidence for the general graph schema view.
