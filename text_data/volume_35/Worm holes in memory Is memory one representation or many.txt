Does cue use affect performance?
The analyses thus far show a) that cues can be voluntarily
changed and b) that this however has no effect on the
dynamic integration of local information with global
frequency information. But did the controlled choice of a
particular retrieval impact memory accessibility? Figure
3 shows the results for number of countries retrieved. An
analysis of variance reveals that the slight advantage in
the Neighbor condition is not greater than we would
expect by chance ( F2,68=.73, p=.48 ). Thus, the overall
accessibility in terms of number of countries was not
dependent on using a particular cue. Item response times
on the other hand reveal a substantial detriment when
countries where retrieved by the letters of the alphabet.
