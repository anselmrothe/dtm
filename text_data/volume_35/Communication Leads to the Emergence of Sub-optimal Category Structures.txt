Category Alignment Two measures were taken to com-
pare participants’ categories and quantify their alignment.
The first, the Rand index (Rand, 1971), consists of a pair-
wise comparison of whether participants tended to place im-
ages in the same category or different categories. The cal-
culation produces a value bounded from 0 to 1, where 1 is
perfect alignment. The second, V-Measure (Rosenberg &
Hirschberg, 2007), is based on variation of information be-
tween the groupings, normalized to compensate for differ-
ences in number of categories. This measure also ranges from        Figure 2: A) An example of a category system optimally
