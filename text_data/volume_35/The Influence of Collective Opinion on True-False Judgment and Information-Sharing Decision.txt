                              Experiment 2
The focus of Experiment 1 was on the effect of collective
opinion on people’s true-false judgments. The main purpose
of Experiment 2 is to examine how collective opinion
affects people’s likelihood of sharing information in a social
media environment. The results from Experiment 2 will also
address the question of whether people are more likely to
share true, debatable, or false information, without knowing            Figure 7. Example of Experiment 2’s invented condition
