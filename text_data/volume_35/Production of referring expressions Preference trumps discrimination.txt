underlying reference production have been the object of
intensive study by researchers in Computational Linguis-
tics (see Krahmer & van Deemter, 2012, for an extensive
review) and Experimental Psycholinguistics (e.g. Lev-

the primary aim of a referring expression is to identify
an object for an interlocutor, a position that is rooted
in a long tradition of philosophical work on the subject
(e.g. Searle, 1969).
