number key on the keyboard. At the beginning of each trial,
a white fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen
for 1 s. The shape then moved as they did in the observation
phase. There was no time limit on responding. After
answering, the correct answer appeared for 1.25 s. After an
error, subjects viewed a repeat display (without responding)
of the moving shape with the correct category displayed.
There were four learning blocks in which each of the 32
items was tested in random order. Because of the category
uncertainty of the critical items (e.g., a square could be in
Categories 1 or 2), subjects could get no more than 75%
correct, assuming they chose the most likely category for all
presented stimuli. In all experiments subjects had to reach at
least 50% correct during the final block of learning to be
included in analysis.
   The final phase of the experiment consisted of a 64-trial
