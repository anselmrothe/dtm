anticipate the referential expression based on the picture and
the speaker, before the name was actually given.
   We hypothesized that listeners would engage episodic
memory areas (medial temporal lobe, e.g., Baddeley, 2000;
lateral prefrontal cortex, Sakai & Passingham, 2004; Kessler
& Kiefer, 2005) together with language areas (e.g., temporal
pole, Imaizumi et al., 1997) in this anticipation period and
possibly after naming. Especially objects that had been
named during the interactive phase (in contrast to objects
without a precedent) should engage these areas, since the
picture would serve as a retrieval cue for retrieving the
precedent. Episodic memory might be activated even more
for objects that had been named by the same speaker, if
                                                                    Figure 1: Example of the participants' screen in the
