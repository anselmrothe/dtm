In this experiment we investigated whether the causal
structure view could provide an alternative explanation for
the results found in previous studies. Just as in previous
studies, participants read scenarios in which an actor
brought about a good or bad side-effect and then they rated
the intentionality of the actor. The scenarios included six
scenarios that have been used in other studies in the
literature, as well as 10 new scenarios created specifically
for this experiment. We were interested in whether we could
