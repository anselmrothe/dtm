Procedure
   The participants were told they would receive shocks
randomly throughout the experiment without any warning
they were going to occur. The participants were asked to
rate their expectancy that the shock would occur at that
moment in time roughly every 5 seconds throughout the
duration of the experiment. Expectancy ratings were made
using the Shuttle Xpress device, on the scale 1 (definitely no
shock) to 5 (definitely shock). Otherwise they were asked to
remain still to avoid motion artifacts in the SCR.                 Figure 1. Graph depicting changes in SCR and expectancy

these specific runs to avoid the build up of associative
strength, and alternated in terms of being reinforced or not.
SCR was measured on these trials, and, due to the absence
of any associative structure during the preceding run, if an
increase in SCR across run length (and level) is found, US
sensitization would explain this. However, if we fail to find
an increasing pattern an alternative explanation for our 2012
results must be sought, perhaps an associative one.
