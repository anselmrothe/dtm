particular, we are interested in examining whether semantic
similarity influences how knowledge is organized. In order
to examine this issue, we developed a task in which
participants are asked to represent the semantic similarity of
animal dyads in two-dimensional space. The distance
between animal pairs is taken as a measure of how closely
the participants represented the concepts. The use of
physical distance as an indicator of representational
similarity has been successfully used in prior studies (e.g.,
Goldstone, 1994; Howard & Howard, 1977).
   Unlike multidimensional studies, in which children are
free to arrange the items along any desired dimension, we
explicitly asked children to put animals of similar kind close
together on the game board. Therefore, this paradigm

Difference score was calculated by subtracting the average

scores indicate that participants put semantically-similar
dyads closer together and non semantically-similar dyads
farther apart. Difference scores approaching zero indicate
that participants did not reliably discriminate between
semantically-similar dyads and non semantically-similar
dyads.
Category-Based Reasoning Task
   The Category-Based Reasoning task is a property-
induction task in which children are presented with triads of
objects and asked to generalize a novel property from the
target to one of the test items. Each triad included a target, a
category-choice, and a lure (e.g., lamb-sheep-frog). Nine
label triads were administered: 3 triads referring to artifacts,
3 triads referring to inanimate natural kinds, and 3 triads
referring to animate natural kinds (see Table 2 for the
complete list of linguistic stimuli). The 3 animate natural
kind triads were also included in the Semantic Space task.
