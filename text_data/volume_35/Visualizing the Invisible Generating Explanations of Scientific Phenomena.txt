only marginally significant, F(1, 126) = 3.13, p = .07.
Scores for air movement also showed a marginally
significant difference, F(1, 126) = 2.93, p=.09, with visual
explanations (M = 2.35, SD = 1.28) containing a greater
number than verbal explanations (M = 1.88, SD = 1.45). No
significant differences between visual (M = .92, SD = .43)
and verbal explanations (M = .79, SD = .65) were found for
the outlet valve. Analysis of the invisible parts between low
and high spatial participants also failed to show any
significant differences in the inclusion of the inlet valve, the
outlet valve, or air movement. Finally a total score for the
inclusion of invisible parts was calculated for each
participant by totaling the scores for the inlet valve, the
outlet valve, and for air movement. The mean score was                 Figure 1: Scores on the post-test, by group and spatial

Materials Each participant was given an immediate post-

the Vandenberg-Kuse Mental Rotation Test (MRT). Half of
the participants received instructions to create a verbal
explanation in writing; the other half received instructions to
create a visual explanation in a drawing. In addition, the                         Table 2: Coding Guide for Function
